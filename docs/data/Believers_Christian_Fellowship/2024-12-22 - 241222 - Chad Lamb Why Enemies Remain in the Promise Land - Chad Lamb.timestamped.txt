[14:41] God that you would take control that you
[14:44] would have preeminence Lord that you
[14:45] would take this vessel of mine under
[14:47] your control that you would speak what
[14:49] you desire to speak Lord that you would

[14:53] that your spirit would have absolute
[14:55] sway that you would speak to your
[14:57] children the words that we have have
[14:59] need of so desperately in this hour that
[15:01] we live and God may we take that word as
[15:04] precious Mana from Heaven may we take it
[15:07] and eat it and grow strength and live

[15:11] it be more than something that tickles
[15:13] our ear but may it be something that
[15:15] changes Our Lives May we go from these
[15:17] doors reflecting the very words that we
[15:19] hear Lord and may they be fleshed out as
[15:22] we become living Epistles written in the

[16:24] moment to wish you a very merry
[16:25] Christmas and say God bless you all it
[16:27] certainly has been a enjoyed to get all
[16:29] the cards I love this time of year it's
[16:31] the only time of year I like going to
[16:33] the
[16:34] mailbox because generally nothing good
[16:37] comes in that mailbox for me but I we
[16:40] everybody in the family kind of fights
[16:42] for who gets to go to the mailbox this
[16:43] time of year and who gets to see the
[16:45] cards first and and we got them on our
[16:47] door there at the pantry and I love
[16:48] looking at them and so it's just a
[16:50] wonderful time that we get to share
[16:52] together and we appreciate that also
[16:54] appreciate all the the candies and the
[16:57] gifts and the things you share with our

[17:06] God bless you this week I know some of
[17:08] you will be traveling we have family
[17:10] events and all kinds of we'll probably
[17:12] all find ourselves in all kinds of
[17:13] different situations but I pray that God
[17:15] will bless you and let his light shine
[17:17] through you wherever you find yourself
[17:19] in this next week and may we never
[17:22] forget amen that that what God has done
[17:25] for us when he came himself and brother
[17:28] B said Jehovah laying in a Manger I
[17:30] don't comprehend that myself but I know
[17:33] that God lowered himself humbled himself
[17:36] for me and he deserves our devotion and
[17:39] our worship and our praise we don't want
[17:41] to ever forget that in all the
[17:44] festivities amen also want to remind you
[17:46] that the watch Night Service will be the
[17:48] following Tuesday on the 31st will begin
[17:50] at 8:00 pm if you would like to share a
[17:52] special with the congregation please
[17:54] just let brother Mike Bower know so he
[17:56] can get it on the list so that we can
[17:59] uh make sure that uh we have everything
[18:01] in order so God bless you we're looking
[18:03] forward to that as well and while you're
[18:05] standing let's turn together to the Book
[18:08] of
[18:12] Exodus the book of
[18:19] Exodus verse or chapter
[18:27] 23 I'm cont contining on with the
[18:29] thought that I was on last time that I
[18:32] ministered and uh we had talked about
[18:34] the responsibility of the adopted and we
[18:36] really typed it with the Israelites
[18:38] taking the land and possessing the land
[18:40] and driving off the enemies and the
[18:42] things that God had given them to do
[18:44] what their responsibility was but I'm
[18:46] going to go just a little further uh a
[18:48] little further in this uh let's look
[18:51] here at Exodus
[18:52] 23 uh verse 23 23 and
[18:56] 23 says for my angel shall go before
[18:59] thee and bring thee into the amorites
[19:01] and the Hittites and the perizzites and
[19:04] the Canaanites and the hivites and the
[19:05] jebusites and I will cut them off Thou
[19:09] shalt not bow down to their gods nor
[19:10] serve them nor do after their works but
[19:13] Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and
[19:15] quite break down their images and you
[19:18] shall serve the Lord your God and he
[19:20] shall bless thy bread and thy water and
[19:22] I will take sickness away from the midst
[19:24] of thee there shall nothing cast their
[19:26] young nor be Barren in the land
[19:29] uh Barren in thy land the number of thy
[19:31] days will I fulfill I will fulfill I
[19:34] will send my fear before thee and I will
[19:36] destroy all the people to whom Thou
[19:39] shalt come and I will make all thine
[19:41] enemies turn their backs unto thee and I
[19:44] will send Hornets before thee which
[19:45] shall drive out the hivite the Canaanite
[19:48] the the hittite from before thee and I
[19:51] will not drive them out from before thee
[19:53] in one year lest thy land become
[19:55] desolate and the beasts of the field
[19:57] multiply against thee by little and
[19:59] little I will drive them out from before
[20:01] thee until thou be increased and inherit
[20:04] the land may God bless you as you take
[20:07] your seats
[20:08] amen amen we'll just ask God to bless us
[20:11] as we share what's on our heart that
[20:13] he'll have absolute
[20:15] control amen so when we when we look
[20:20] back at the subject of The Exodus and
[20:22] The Taking of the land and the
[20:24] Israelites moving into the promise that
[20:26] God gave to them and they had a
[20:28] responsib to take the land and we know
[20:30] that in some ways they failed to do all
[20:32] that God had required of them to do and
[20:35] I'd like to just look for a subject
[20:37] tonight look at the thought of why
[20:38] enemies remain in the promised land why
[20:42] enemies remain in the promised land and
[20:44] we obviously we're going to use that as
[20:45] a parallel for our lives in the day we
[20:47] live in why enemies remain in the
[20:49] promised land because we realize that
[20:50] there's still some enemies that remain
[20:52] among us and so we want to look at that
[20:55] and uh just to let the cat out of the
[20:57] bag I think there's various reasons for
[20:59] that we're not going to look at just one
[21:00] reason that God's always accomplishing
[21:02] many things and he always has a
[21:04] diversity of ways in which he operates
[21:06] God is actually multiac faceted and
[21:09] quite complex you can't you can't
[21:11] simplify God down in any situation and
[21:14] say God is doing this in this situation
[21:16] because God is usually doing multiple
[21:17] things in every situation God is working
[21:20] somebody else's life your life he's
[21:21] maturing you he's correcting you he's
[21:23] doing all kinds of stuff he's preparing
[21:25] you for the next trial there's a
[21:26] multifaceted things going on on so as we
[21:29] look at this I believe there's multiple
[21:31] reasons that enemies remain in the land
[21:33] amen and we may not even be able to
[21:35] explore all of them we probably haven't
[21:36] even had our mind open to everything
[21:38] that God did in his word amen because
[21:40] God is so deep and so rich and it
[21:42] touches everything amen but we just want
[21:44] to look at a few things that we're able
[21:46] to see and when we look
[21:49] here in
[21:51] uh uh let's look back here verse 27 that
[21:54] we just read I will send my fear before
[21:57] thee and I will destroy all the people
[21:59] to whom Thou shalt come and I will make
[22:01] all thine enemies turn their backs unto
[22:02] thee and I will send Hornets before thee
[22:05] which shall drive out the hivite and the
[22:06] canite the hittite from before Thee I
[22:09] will not drive them out from before thee
[22:11] in one year lest the land become
[22:13] desolate and the Beast of the field
[22:15] multiply against thee by little and
[22:17] little will I drive them out from before
[22:20] thee until thou be increased and inherit
[22:22] the land before God ever sent him there
[22:25] he told them this isn't going to be
[22:27] instant
[22:29] this isn't going to be you give your
[22:31] heart to the Lord You're filled with the
[22:32] Holy Ghost and everything's vanished
[22:33] amen everything that ever troubled you
[22:35] everything that you ever had a problem
[22:37] with everything you ever struggle with
[22:38] it's all immediately gone but he says no
[22:40] but little by little I'll drive them out
[22:43] as you're able to take the land amen and
[22:46] we realize that there's things there's
[22:48] realities in the gospel there's truths
[22:50] Amen in the word of God that God wants
[22:52] us to grab a hold of and he wants us to
[22:54] stand on he wants us to have the word
[22:57] and manifest the word amen but there's
[22:59] things in our lives that we're not ready
[23:01] to manifest yet there's truths that we
[23:02] can't grasp there's things that are too
[23:04] deep for us and God Amen is driving back
[23:08] amen the enemy little by little so that
[23:10] we can possess more and more and
[23:11] manifest more and more amen I told you
[23:15] this before but when we first come to
[23:16] the message amen I realized I begin to
[23:18] hear the message and begin to realize my
[23:20] life was nowhere close to what God
[23:22] desired for his sons to be and how he
[23:24] desired for his sons to live and I
[23:26] remember all the massive changes that
[23:27] took place in my life as I changed the
[23:29] way I dress and I changed the
[23:31] associations I had I changed beliefs I I
[23:34] cut the cable television out then I
[23:36] kicked the television out all together
[23:37] and and we went through all of these
[23:39] changes in our lives and they were
[23:41] massive changes amen but then we
[23:43] realized hey hey we we turned our life
[23:45] around amen we got rid of all the
[23:47] enemies we we we now are are a vessel
[23:50] that God's using we now Sanctified our
[23:52] home and Sanctified our lives and we've
[23:54] done all these things and then you know
[23:56] you think ah we've got Victory it's all
[23:58] over but then you realize there's still
[24:00] enemies in the
[24:01] land begin to realize now we got rid of
[24:04] so many external things and so many
[24:06] tripping things that tripped us up and
[24:08] things that weren't pleasing to God but
[24:10] then God started working down on the
[24:11] inside of us and we realized there's
[24:13] things there that aren't right either
[24:15] there's things that are still tripping
[24:17] me up and fighting me in mind battles
[24:19] and and things from the past and things
[24:21] from my childhood and traditional ways
[24:23] of think there were still enemies in the
[24:25] land amen and God was driving them out
[24:27] little by little
[24:30] and I think he's still driving them out
[24:33] for me we're realizing as we go deeper
[24:35] and deeper within ourselves amen we're
[24:37] finding more places that God wants to
[24:40] manifest himself because he wants
[24:42] preeminence in all of
[24:44] us and so God's working deeper and
[24:47] deeper inside of us and we realized when
[24:50] Israel could not drive out the
[24:53] inhabitants we're going to look at that
[24:54] again in a way of review but I just want
[24:57] to note that God told them ahead of time
[25:00] this wasn't going to be short it wasn't
[25:02] going to be instant but I was going to
[25:04] do it little by little but yet he
[25:06] promised to do it amen let's go to
[25:10] Exodus
[25:18] 34 Exodus
[25:22] 34 and verse
[25:27] 11 says observe that thou which I
[25:31] commanded thee this day behold I drive
[25:32] out before Thee the Amorite and the
[25:35] Canaanite and the hittite and the
[25:36] perizzite and the hivite and the
[25:39] jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou
[25:41] make a covenant with the inhabitants of
[25:43] the land whether thou goest lest it be
[25:45] for a snare in the midst of thee but ye
[25:49] shall destroy their altars break down
[25:51] their images and cut down their Groves
[25:53] so God tells them go down and utterly
[25:56] destroy them and destroy all of their
[25:59] worship and and he he warns them to do
[26:02] this ahead of time and we find out that
[26:04] they fail in this
[26:06] warning uh let's go to Deuteronomy
[26:09] chapter
[26:15] 11 yeah Deuteronomy 11 verse
[26:21] 22 Deuteronomy 11:22 for if you shall
[26:24] diligently keep all these Commandments
[26:26] which I command you to do them
[26:28] to love the Lord your God to walk in all
[26:30] his ways and to cleave unto him then
[26:33] will the Lord drive out all these
[26:35] nations from before you and ye shall
[26:36] possess greater Nations and mightier
[26:39] than
[26:40] yourselves every place wherein the soul
[26:42] of your feet shall tread shall be yours
[26:45] from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the
[26:48] river the river Euphrates even unto the
[26:50] OS sea shall your Coast be there shall
[26:52] no man be able to stand before you for
[26:55] the Lord your God shall lay the fear of
[26:57] you and the dread of you upon all the
[26:59] land and you shall tread upon that that
[27:02] you shall tread upon as he hath said
[27:04] unto you so we talked last time about
[27:08] the the the uh commission that was given
[27:10] to them to go possess the land God
[27:13] brought them up not to just not to just
[27:15] give them the land he did give them the
[27:17] land but he told them to possess the
[27:19] land that's an important terminology
[27:21] amen God can say you know I give you the
[27:24] land just walk into the land and sit
[27:26] upon it and enjoy but no they to go
[27:28] possess it they had to make it their
[27:30] land amen and in order to possess the
[27:32] land they had to drive out whoever was
[27:34] holding on to it and whoever was
[27:35] hindering them from possessing it that
[27:37] was their job but God says I'll do it
[27:41] I'll drive them out then he says you
[27:42] drive them out but he already said I'll
[27:44] drive them out and so we find that God
[27:46] was working in and through his people
[27:49] and for and on behalf of his people he
[27:51] was doing it all he was working through
[27:53] them and he was working for them and he
[27:55] was working side by side with them he
[27:57] was working where they couldn't work if
[27:59] they worked where they could work yeah
[28:01] amen so this was God's promise but he
[28:04] told them that you're to possess the
[28:05] land and then he told them that wherever
[28:07] The Souls of your foot shall tread that
[28:09] will I give you so possession meant a
[28:11] perseverance meant op pressing amen you
[28:14] had to actually go take the land God
[28:16] says it's yours but you must go tread
[28:18] upon it amen and the tread upon it
[28:20] wasn't a leisurely lot walk through the
[28:22] park saying this is mine and this is
[28:24] mine and this is mine because there were
[28:26] inhabitants on that land and in order
[28:28] order for you to to to in order for you
[28:30] to possess that land and tread upon it
[28:32] you had to fight off Whoever thought it
[28:34] was
[28:38] theirs
[28:40] amen praise be to
[28:42] God and so that was the commission that
[28:45] was given to them brother B says uh this
[28:48] God told them way down in Egypt I give
[28:50] you that land but he didn't say I'll go
[28:52] out there and sweep it all out and
[28:54] garnish the houses and hang up the
[28:55] curtains and everything you all just
[28:56] move in no no they had to fight for
[28:59] every inch of ground they took that's
[29:01] right fighting and take it by every
[29:04] fight every inch but he said everywhere
[29:06] The Souls of your foot land that's
[29:08] possession footsteps is possession
[29:11] that's the same thing it is today Divine
[29:12] Healing belongs to us the Holy Spirit
[29:15] belongs to us it's our property but
[29:17] you'll fight every inch of it yes sir
[29:20] but brother footsteps is possession just
[29:23] keep fighting take it the devil says the
[29:24] days of Miracles has passed say you're a
[29:26] liar God said he's the same yesterday
[29:28] today and forever take it over
[29:30] everywhere your footsteps that that's
[29:33] possession that's right amen oh praise
[29:36] God we thought it was going to be easy
[29:38] we got the message of the hour we got
[29:40] the power that's come back the fullness
[29:41] of the Holy Ghost amen we've got all
[29:43] these promises and God's called us to be
[29:45] his bride amen we'll just go in and take
[29:48] it oh friends it's been a fight the
[29:50] whole
[29:51] way amen listen there there has been
[29:54] enemies that's been working against us
[29:57] possessing this this
[29:58] land some of those enemies have been
[30:01] working generationally in your
[30:03] life amen they've been working you know
[30:06] through Grandma and Grandpa and Mom and
[30:08] Dad and there's certain things amen that
[30:10] that are that are things that are
[30:12] complexes or temperaments or or or our
[30:15] genetic uh predispositions that have
[30:17] been working down through our lives and
[30:19] they come into us and we find ourselves
[30:21] amen with the same kind of problem mom
[30:23] had or the same kind of problem dad had
[30:25] or the same kind of problem grandpa had
[30:27] and we find our ourselves with this in
[30:28] this flesh body and these things are are
[30:31] hindrances to us fulfilling the fullness
[30:33] of the word and they're things that must
[30:35] be driven out of our
[30:37] land things that we can't just uh cope
[30:40] with or deal with or act like they're
[30:42] not there but we must resist some of
[30:44] these things and the devil thinks he's
[30:47] got a
[30:48] right yeah because it's
[30:52] generational did it with Grandpa and
[30:54] Grandpa get with Mom and Dad you can say
[30:56] but I'm not letting it it's not going to
[30:58] be so easy I'm not just going to roll
[31:01] over and let that thing control me you
[31:04] know if I've got to fight with it every
[31:05] day of my life I'm still going to fight
[31:07] with it I'm going to resist it amen I'm
[31:09] not just going to roll over and say well
[31:11] that's the way mom was and that's the
[31:12] way I am it's not okay with me amen I
[31:15] don't want to be this way I want to be
[31:17] all that God designed for me to
[31:20] be amen we're going to we're going to
[31:23] look at that a lot more as we move on
[31:25] but let's just keep doing our little
[31:27] review here let's go go to judges now
[31:29] Judges chapter
[31:33] 1 judges chap 1:
[31:40] 18
[31:43] says also Judah took Gaza with the coast
[31:47] thereof and ascalon with the coast
[31:49] thereof and erron with the coast thereof
[31:52] and the Lord was with Judah and he drave
[31:53] out the inhabitants of the mountain but
[31:56] he could not drive out the inhabit Ence
[31:58] of the valley because they had Chariots
[31:59] of iron and they gave Hein unto Caleb as
[32:03] Moses had said and he expelled then the
[32:05] three sons of aning so we find that
[32:07] they're already having tremendous
[32:10] victories listen when they moved into
[32:12] the land they had tremendous victories
[32:14] they routed huge armies they they
[32:16] displaced huge numbers of people amen
[32:19] they utterly destroyed and wiped out all
[32:22] kinds of places but they got to certain
[32:24] places and in certain places they could
[32:27] not have victory
[32:28] they would wipe out armies they would
[32:30] wipe out Coalition of forces that would
[32:32] come together with four or five Kings at
[32:34] a time and they would utterly destroy
[32:36] them and heue them to the
[32:38] ground but then they come to places amen
[32:41] where these Canaanites were deeply
[32:43] embedded and they got to these places
[32:44] where they just couldn't drive them
[32:47] out but they had to remember God said
[32:50] I'll drive them out little by
[32:52] little don't get discouraged he's
[32:54] promised that they'll go but they might
[32:56] go little by little
[33:00] amen it's not it's not outside the word
[33:02] of God Amen let's look at verse 27
[33:06] now neither did Manasseh drive out the
[33:09] inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor
[33:12] tanak and her towns nor the inhabitants
[33:15] of D in her towns nor the inhabitants of
[33:17] IAM in her towns nor the inhabitants of
[33:20] megiddo in her towns but the Canaanites
[33:23] uh would dwell in the land and it came
[33:25] to pass when Israel was strong that they
[33:27] put the Canaanites to
[33:29] Tribute ah it's
[33:31] amazing when they when they became
[33:34] strong they put the Canaanites in
[33:38] tribute what a
[33:40] trap what a
[33:42] trap when they became strong when they
[33:45] had a lot of the land when they had
[33:46] overcome a whole bunch of it but we
[33:48] couldn't overcome this but we're strong
[33:50] and we're stronger than this so we're
[33:52] going to put it under
[33:53] tribute my oh my what a trap and it came
[33:57] to pass with the Israel was strong that
[33:59] they put the Canaanites to Tribute and
[34:00] did not utterly drive them
[34:03] out oh what a shame that's where they
[34:07] failed they didn't fa it wasn't a
[34:09] failure that they couldn't drive them
[34:11] out that was no failure they didn't fail
[34:15] because they could not overcome them
[34:19] they they failed because they quit
[34:21] trying to overcome
[34:23] them there is no failure in not being
[34:25] able to drive them out because they had
[34:28] iron chariots they were embedded they
[34:29] had walled cities they had places they
[34:31] they just weren't able to do it in one
[34:33] place they would wipe out everybody by
[34:35] the power of God they weren't fighting
[34:37] by themselves they were fighting with
[34:38] God God was fighting with them and in
[34:40] them amen it wasn't their own power it
[34:42] was God working in them and they would
[34:44] have tremendous victories then they get
[34:46] to another place and they can't have
[34:48] Victory amen the the reality was they it
[34:50] wasn't them by themselves that had
[34:52] Victory it was God with them and now if
[34:55] Victory is withheld with them amen it
[34:57] does doesn't mean that they failed it
[34:59] just means that Victory is
[35:04] delayed it can't God's promise Can't
[35:07] Fail amen so that means victory's
[35:09] delayed what do you do when victory's
[35:11] delayed you keep
[35:13] fighting amen not not saying we can't
[35:16] overcome well the truth is you never
[35:18] could overcome it wasn't you that
[35:20] overcome to begin with it was God in you
[35:22] through you and around you and for you
[35:24] it was God that was overcoming it was
[35:26] never you so when you come up to the
[35:28] Canaanite that's deeply embedded in a
[35:30] place that you can't drive them out amen
[35:32] don't say I can't drive them out well
[35:34] that's true you couldn't drive anybody
[35:36] out you can say well I got rid of this
[35:38] in my life and I got rid of this in my
[35:39] life and I overcame this in my life but
[35:41] I can't overcome this in my life the
[35:43] reality is you didn't overcome anything
[35:45] in your life you resisted the devil
[35:48] according to the word and by the power
[35:49] of the spirit those things were driven
[35:51] out of your life you didn't do it by
[35:53] yourself amen you did it because he told
[35:56] you to do it but he gave you the power
[35:58] to do it and he made it come to
[36:00] pass and now when we come up against
[36:02] something an obstacle that we can't seem
[36:04] to drive out then all of a sudden we say
[36:06] I can't when you say I can't drive them
[36:08] out I mean really what you're saying is
[36:11] I could drive them out but I can't drive
[36:14] these
[36:17] out see the problem is we focus so much
[36:20] on
[36:23] ourselves I could overcome this but I
[36:25] can't overcome this
[36:30] no God helped you overcome this and God
[36:34] will help you overcome the other
[36:38] there amen
[36:41] amen cuz God's got a purpose in
[36:43] everything God has a perfect plan we
[36:47] realize that nothing's getting all out
[36:50] of kilter with God God's not losing
[36:52] control of
[36:54] situations and so we we have to be
[36:57] careful in the way we approach it and
[36:59] that we don't ever just give in now
[37:03] we're going to talk a little bit further
[37:04] about things that God permits to remain
[37:07] and the purpose that they have and me
[37:09] we're going to talk about that because
[37:11] that's that's very much how God
[37:13] works uh so God became angry with Israel
[37:18] because he wasn't angry because they
[37:21] couldn't drive out the Canaanites he was
[37:22] angry because they put them under
[37:24] tribute which they made a peace league
[37:26] with them and says we're stronger than
[37:29] you we've got you under control we're
[37:31] not going to wipe you out we'll leave
[37:32] you alone you leave us alone you just
[37:33] stay out of our
[37:35] way that was the league and we know it
[37:38] never worked because those they made a
[37:39] league with eventually grew and become
[37:41] the ones that overcame them in judges
[37:44] chap 2 verse1 we'll look at a couple
[37:47] more verses here in judges in Judges
[37:49] chapter 2 vers1 it says and an angel of
[37:51] the Lord came up from gilgal to bacham
[37:54] and said I made you to go up out of
[37:56] Egypt and I have brought brought you
[37:57] unto the land which I swore unto your
[37:59] fathers and I said I will never break my
[38:02] Covenant with you and you shall make no
[38:04] league with the inhabitants of this land
[38:06] you shall throw down their altars but
[38:08] you have not obeyed my voice why have
[38:11] you done this wherefore I also said I
[38:14] will not drive them out from before you
[38:16] but they shall be as thorns in your
[38:18] sides and their God shall be as a snare
[38:20] unto you and it shall come to pass when
[38:22] the angel of the Lord spake these words
[38:25] unto all the children of Israel that the
[38:27] people lifted up their voice and
[38:30] wept amen let's turn from
[38:32] there
[38:34] uh there was one more scripture I want
[38:37] to read no no I've got a quote I'm going
[38:39] to read but we're going to go stay in
[38:40] judges we're going to come back to that
[38:41] in a minute and the message Christ is
[38:44] the mystery of God revealed brother bam
[38:47] makes this statement that's super
[38:48] interesting to me he says now we come
[38:52] back here and to visit the climate in
[38:54] this place I certainly don't like cuz it
[38:57] just breaks me down as soon as I get
[38:59] here I can cross the top of the knobs up
[39:01] there and come down in this Valley and
[39:03] I'm here about 10 minutes and I got
[39:05] hives and get sick weather swimmy-headed
[39:08] everything looks spooky dark I just have
[39:11] to get out of it see and the other day I
[39:13] was talking to the wife what what but
[39:15] what brings me in first what brings me
[39:17] in here is you people see this church I
[39:20] tell you of all the places I ever went
[39:21] in my life this is my favorite place to
[39:23] come preach the gospel and it looks like
[39:25] that we can make a tape from here that
[39:27] 10 times better than anywhere else see
[39:29] see that's the reason I say where God is
[39:31] doing something then stay right with it
[39:34] but I think where the great thing is
[39:36] that was me failing to go out the first
[39:38] time when he called me and therefore he
[39:41] makes it kind of rough on me when I come
[39:43] in obedience is better than
[39:47] sacrifice this is what I want to spend a
[39:49] little bit of time looking
[39:51] on brother brandham come to a place in
[39:55] his life when he was in mishala Indiana
[39:57] and he was up there on a fishing trip
[39:58] and he come back through and we know the
[40:00] story where he saw all the signs uh that
[40:02] said Jesus only Jesus only there was a
[40:04] Convention of the Jesus only Pentecostal
[40:06] movement and he went into the meeting
[40:08] and he was just enthralled with what he
[40:10] saw and what he heard and and then he
[40:12] was asked to come and preach and we know
[40:13] the experience that he had he just lost
[40:15] himself in preaching and afterwards he
[40:17] had a whole stack of invitations from
[40:19] all over the nation and he goes home and
[40:21] when he goes home he tells his wife and
[40:23] his wife is excited because it looks
[40:24] like God's moving in the ministry and
[40:26] they went and talked to to his
[40:27] mother-in-law and his mother-in-law just
[40:29] just rung him out she just told him what
[40:31] four and this and that and you're not
[40:33] going to drag my daughter all over
[40:34] amongst those people and drag these
[40:36] children from Pillar To Post and brother
[40:39] Benham left there defeated because of
[40:42] the words of his mother-in-law and even
[40:44] his wife told him says don't listen
[40:46] we'll just go on anyway and he said no
[40:48] no we don't want to upset her and he
[40:51] turned down the first
[40:55] call and when he turned down the first
[40:57] call that's what he's saying here but I
[40:59] think where the great thing is that was
[41:00] me failing to go out the first time when
[41:02] he called me and therefore he makes it
[41:05] kind of rough on me when I come in
[41:07] obedience is better than
[41:10] sacrifice this is what I'm I was
[41:13] beginning to look at and all of this and
[41:16] realize that God told the nation of
[41:19] Israel I'll drive them out you possess
[41:22] the land footsteps are possession I'll
[41:24] go before you I'll fight with you all of
[41:26] these but when they when they failed to
[41:29] fully obey the word and put them under
[41:31] leag he says I'll no longer drive them
[41:32] out but there'll be thorns in your side
[41:35] and then you say my goodness why is
[41:38] there thorns in their side forever and
[41:40] they'll become a prick to them and
[41:41] they'll become an irritant and they'll
[41:43] become a problem for them and we find
[41:45] brother brandham in the same exact spot
[41:48] the same spot as the whole nation of
[41:50] Israel now he's got an irritant and a
[41:52] prick and a thorn he's got this
[41:54] situation where he'll go off preaching
[41:56] everywhere else but when he comes back
[41:58] to his favorite place in all the world
[42:00] to preach the place he wants to be the
[42:02] people he wants to be with the place
[42:04] where his ministry is effective and he
[42:06] can make a tape that seems to be 10
[42:08] times better than anywhere else when he
[42:09] comes back home and he comes back to the
[42:11] place now all of a sudden there's this
[42:13] Thorn and this prick he gets sick he
[42:15] breaks out in hives he gets
[42:17] swimmy-headed he starts feeling awful
[42:19] and why is he feeling awful he says
[42:21] because I didn't go out the first
[42:23] place obedience is better than sacrifice
[42:26] amen
[42:28] begin to realize when God left the
[42:31] inhabitants of the land to be a prick
[42:33] and a snare and a thorn to
[42:35] them that was
[42:41] love you would think that his love would
[42:44] take them
[42:46] away but his love let them
[42:50] stay you think for the prophet of God
[42:52] who sacrificed his life to God and gave
[42:54] up so much and and served God all over
[42:57] the world that God would make it easy on
[42:59] him when we come back home to his
[43:00] favorite place to preach at least when
[43:02] he comes back there he could have some
[43:03] peace but no when he comes back there
[43:05] because he failed to go the first time
[43:07] now when he comes back to what would be
[43:09] his favorite place he has this little
[43:10] Thorn this little irritant that he
[43:12] breaks out in hives gets sick and
[43:13] swimmy-headed why because he said
[43:15] obedience is better than sacrifice and
[43:17] God Amen would allow something to remain
[43:20] in the prophet's life that would remind
[43:22] the prophet the best thing in your life
[43:24] is to do what I say the very best thing
[43:27] that you could ever do is just obey
[43:29] because obedience is better than
[43:31] sacrifice and it's the love of God
[43:33] sometimes that will leave an irritant in
[43:35] our life because of our mistake and our
[43:37] failure to remind us amen why because
[43:40] God's love amen we we find God's love
[43:43] and obedience to his word God doesn't
[43:45] just give us his word and his
[43:46] Commandments amen just to make us do
[43:48] things and jump through hoops he tells
[43:50] us things for our benefit for our
[43:52] blessing because it's the best way to
[43:54] live because it's it it'll serve his
[43:56] purpose because it'll give Victory to
[43:58] ourselves and many many people and when
[44:00] we defy that word and we reject that
[44:03] word it's going to cause harm to
[44:04] numerous amounts of people and to
[44:06] ourselves so the very love of God will
[44:09] allow us in a mistake to have a thorn
[44:12] and to leave the thorn in our life so
[44:14] that we remember the best thing for me
[44:16] to do is keep his
[44:18] word and that's God's
[44:21] love it looks like it's punishment it
[44:23] looks like it's just punishment just
[44:26] just reprimand and
[44:31] indefinitely no friends that's God's
[44:34] love
[44:36] amen you know there's many of us that
[44:39] are suffering things because of our
[44:41] failure there's many of us that still
[44:43] suffer things because we knew
[44:46] better and we did it
[44:48] anyways we knew better and we chose
[44:51] another path we knew better we did it
[44:53] and some of those things are things you
[44:54] cannot erase right some of those sins
[44:57] that we commit in the body some of the
[44:58] things we do against our family and it
[45:00] leaves a little something amen and that
[45:03] something is something we can never get
[45:04] away from even if it's in our mind even
[45:06] it's a Memory even if it's a a a
[45:08] something in the family that causes a
[45:10] little Strife or tension or an area amen
[45:13] that we can't never get away from that
[45:15] but i' like to say tonight that that's
[45:16] the love of God Amen because we reminds
[45:19] us hey hey this thing is something I
[45:23] deserve yeah right because of what I did
[45:26] it's not what God did to me this is what
[45:28] I did yeah right and God's love doesn't
[45:31] just brush it away easily and just erase
[45:34] it but God's love lets it stay there so
[45:36] his love can be manifest in me because
[45:38] his love is his word to me and if I keep
[45:40] his word I abide in his love and and
[45:43] everything that he wants for my life
[45:44] will
[45:48] transpire
[45:52] amen praise
[45:54] God but I'd like to say it this this way
[45:58] too that's no reason to
[46:02] quit that's no reason to give up that's
[46:05] no reason to stop pushing back that's no
[46:08] reason to quit praying for
[46:14] deliverance amen let's just be real we
[46:16] say this is my fault this is not God's
[46:19] fault it's my fault I did this I caused
[46:23] this pain I'm suffering because of what
[46:25] I did but I'm not going to let that
[46:28] control me or change I'm going to serve
[46:30] God even with this brother Brandon was
[46:32] coming back to Jeffersonville what to
[46:34] preach to make tapes to do conventions
[46:37] to have meetings to make these tapes
[46:39] amen that we are listening to now he
[46:41] pushed beyond that thing and didn't let
[46:42] it control him and didn't let it stop
[46:44] him but he said that's my fault I have
[46:47] to deal with that but I'm moving on in
[46:49] the program of God and I don't think he
[46:51] ever quit praying or hoping that God
[46:53] would take that
[46:54] away so we don't put it under tribute we
[46:57] don't just roll over and say that's the
[46:58] way it is we say that's my fault but I'm
[47:01] moving on God please help
[47:04] me amen
[47:09] amen when I begin to look at the
[47:11] prophet's life I begin to realize I
[47:13] begin to appreciate so much that God
[47:16] gave us a prophet in this generation and
[47:18] recorded his life yeah and then that
[47:21] Prophet was so humble and honest he
[47:23] would just tell us everything that
[47:24] happens the way he felt and the mistakes
[47:26] he made and the things he got right and
[47:27] the things he got wrong and all the
[47:29] things God did I'm so thankful because
[47:31] if all we got was the message in a in a
[47:33] book form and it came down and that
[47:35] message would begin to tell us that
[47:37] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[47:39] God is calling you to a union with him
[47:41] now he's going to be manifest in Bride
[47:43] form in you and the fullness of the life
[47:45] has come back the fullness of the power
[47:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[47:48] forever and all the signs that were in
[47:50] Christ and all that he did should be
[47:52] manifest in the bride amen if that's all
[47:54] we had amen and we didn't have a life to
[47:57] look at we would be a terribly
[47:59] disappointed confused people because we
[48:02] would think that all those promises he
[48:04] made and all those truths would mean
[48:06] that we were bulletproof and had no
[48:08] problems and spoke the word and
[48:10] everything just just erased from our
[48:12] lives and we eradicated from sickness
[48:14] and family trouble and personal issues
[48:17] and mistakes and failures and all the
[48:19] consequences that come from them we
[48:20] would think to be this word we have to
[48:24] have a life that looks like this
[48:27] but brother Ram didn't just preach the
[48:28] message he demonstrated the message he
[48:31] lived the message he was the first part
[48:34] of that word to come to harvest maturity
[48:36] it came in him it was Christ in him
[48:38] manifesting the son of man Ministry and
[48:41] what did we have we had a prophet of God
[48:43] where God was working through a vessel
[48:45] doing some of the greatest Miracles that
[48:47] have ever been done and recorded on the
[48:48] face of the Earth and he was standing
[48:50] gripping a Pulpit so hard cuz he was so
[48:53] sick he was about to fall over and he
[48:55] couldn't get healed but everybody that
[48:57] come by got healed yeah
[49:01] right
[49:04] amen you have a man who had all kinds of
[49:08] complications and trials and difficulty
[49:10] he had campaign managers that would turn
[49:12] their back on him he had them that would
[49:14] steal his magazine and steal his tent he
[49:16] had rejection he had people in his own
[49:18] church who fall away he had all he had
[49:20] people who would rise up and and call
[49:22] him Jesus Christ and start baptizing in
[49:23] his name he had people who would call
[49:25] him a devil and come away he had
[49:27] everything that could go wrong he got
[49:29] sick he got the flu he got swimmy-headed
[49:32] when he come back to
[49:35] Jeffersonville he had a rejection
[49:37] complex that would causing problems he
[49:38] talked about standing in the Gap
[49:44] he he had a problem with his son who
[49:47] went off and got married he had to ad
[49:48] the marriage and then got married wrong
[49:50] and had all this trouble and this yeah
[49:53] right oh I'm so thankful we didn't just
[49:56] have word but we had life amen we had
[49:59] what is it to have a son of God and now
[50:01] has amen Christ working through him has
[50:04] the full revelation of the word
[50:06] manifesting the very things that Christ
[50:07] did did did God manifest himself through
[50:10] that vessel did he do the very works
[50:12] that Christ did did he get sick did he
[50:15] throw up did he have a headache did he
[50:18] have a thorn in his flesh did he make a
[50:19] mistake did he suffer the rest of his
[50:21] life for a
[50:24] mistake so if God if that's what it's
[50:27] like to be a Son of God then I can be a
[50:29] Son of God
[50:30] too I can be a Son of God I can have a
[50:33] problem in my home I can have a thorn in
[50:35] my flesh I can be still be suffering
[50:37] from a mistake I made 20 years ago and
[50:39] not able to erase it from my life but I
[50:41] can still be a Son of God Amen
[50:45] I I can be sick and still
[50:48] believe amen right I can be weak and
[50:52] still believe I can be afflicted and
[50:55] still believe I can be a rejected and
[50:57] believe
[51:00] amen I'm so thank I I I'm so thankful
[51:04] that God has given us 1200
[51:10] tapes I just think we'd be so confused
[51:12] without it but now we can live what he's
[51:16] called us to live without
[51:18] misunderstanding what it's supposed to
[51:19] look
[51:24] like let's look at uh
[51:27] 2 Corinthians we're going to come back
[51:28] to judges but let's just look quick at 2
[51:31] Corinthians chapter
[51:50] 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[51:56] in verse 7 2 Corinthians 12:
[52:00] 7 and lest I should be exalted above
[52:03] measure through the abundance of the
[52:04] Revelation there was given to me a thorn
[52:07] in the flesh the messenger of Satan to
[52:09] Buffet me lest I should be exalted above
[52:14] measure this is the Apostle
[52:17] Paul the Apostle Paul who was the first
[52:20] church age
[52:21] messenger he was the the he had the
[52:24] gospel of grace he he he set the
[52:27] doctrine of grace in order he he wrote
[52:30] most of the New Testament he had
[52:32] manifestations in his life he was called
[52:34] to a very high position he was an
[52:35] apostle called to the Lord he met him as
[52:37] the pillar of fire and the form he
[52:39] returned to after his death and
[52:42] resurrection and the Apostle Paul raised
[52:45] the dead open blind eyes had all manner
[52:49] of manifestation in his life and had the
[52:52] the the word he knew the word
[52:57] but God would see fit to leave an enemy
[53:00] in his
[53:02] life a messenger of Satan to Buffet him
[53:06] a thorn in the flesh to trouble him and
[53:09] why would God leave an enemy in his life
[53:11] and we have no we have no uh record in
[53:13] the Bible that this was any fault of the
[53:15] Apostle Paul we don't know that he did
[53:18] anything to deserve this it was just
[53:20] something that God chose to allow and
[53:23] what would God why would God choose to
[53:25] allow it
[53:26] because of the abundance of the
[53:28] Revelation so that he wouldn't be puffed
[53:31] up God knew that for Paul it was
[53:34] dangerous for
[53:36] him it was dangerous for him to have all
[53:39] this abundance of Revelation in this
[53:40] position God called him men without
[53:42] something to balance it out because it
[53:45] could it could actually this abundance
[53:46] of Revelation could actually work
[53:48] something negative in The Human Side of
[53:50] Paul and Paul could find himself
[53:51] straight away so God did something in
[53:54] his love for Paul that would keep Paul
[53:57] in the straight and
[54:00] arrow praise be to
[54:02] God so Paul sought the Lord three times
[54:05] that this would be delivered but when
[54:07] God told him no this is th my grace is
[54:10] sufficient for thee I've given this to
[54:13] thee then he says now I'll glory in my
[54:15] infirmities because I know that this is
[54:17] God working something wonderful in my
[54:18] life now I'm not going to be sad about
[54:21] it I'm not going to be depressed I'm not
[54:22] going to quit the ministry yeah right
[54:25] I'm going to keep pressing forward
[54:26] because God's done this to keep me right
[54:29] so that I can
[54:31] Minister praise be to God things are not
[54:35] what we think amen if that could be the
[54:37] Apostle Paul what about you and I
[54:40] yeah amen and I don't know that it was
[54:43] like I said I don't know that it was
[54:44] Paul's fault we have no reason to
[54:46] believe that it was something Paul did
[54:47] wrong but in fact it was something that
[54:49] was going right in his life that he had
[54:52] an abundance of
[54:53] Revelation say thank you God
[54:57] brother brandham starts to talk about
[54:58] his life here in uniting times and signs
[55:01] in 1963 and he
[55:04] says he said what's this
[55:07] tension if I could have been born
[55:09] without this tension well if I wouldn't
[55:11] have had had this tension I wouldn't
[55:13] have been what I am I wouldn't have been
[55:15] a Christian perhaps it was this tension
[55:17] that drove me to Jesus Christ see so
[55:19] it's been a blessed blessing thing to
[55:23] me that's so hard to say
[55:26] because this this tension that he had
[55:28] didn't do him any favors in the natural
[55:30] it it really plagued his life it
[55:32] troubled him from the time he was a
[55:34] little boy he would get nervous and get
[55:36] upset and have all these things in his
[55:37] life amen but he says it's this tension
[55:40] that drove me to Jesus Christ so it's
[55:42] been a blessing blessing thing to me but
[55:44] listen what he goes on to say so then as
[55:47] Paul said as though when he had tension
[55:49] or something or another he had consulted
[55:51] the Lord to take it away from him three
[55:52] times and the Lord said uh Saul uh my
[55:56] grace is sufficient he said then I will
[55:59] glory in my infirmities when I am weak I
[56:01] am strong as long as it's to the will of
[56:03] God all right now I consulted him one
[56:06] time when it used to bother me so bad it
[56:08] scared me and he told me about eight or
[56:10] 10 years ago he said it'll never scare
[56:12] you again and it never has did it no sir
[56:16] don't worry about it I just feel it but
[56:18] I know it's there but I just go on
[56:20] because it don't scare me no more so
[56:22] thankful for that am now he could have
[56:25] said it won't be no more just as well as
[56:28] that it won't scare you no
[56:31] more so it it it's his will that it
[56:34] happen so I just embrace it and say
[56:36] thank you Lord I'll walk that way yeah
[56:40] this is something that this is not
[56:42] something that was a light Affliction
[56:43] for the prophet of God but it was
[56:45] serious and it caused him serious bouts
[56:47] uh uh serious bouts of trouble health
[56:50] issues tension and
[56:52] trouble but then he realized when God
[56:55] told him he won't scare you no more he
[56:57] realized God could have just as easily
[56:58] said it won't be no more so they were
[57:01] serving some purpose now brother B
[57:03] starts to say well it's this tension
[57:05] that made me what I am it's this tension
[57:07] that made me a Christian maybe I
[57:08] wouldn't be amen maybe it's this tension
[57:09] that drove me to Jesus Christ so praise
[57:12] God whatever God allows is for good he
[57:14] didn't listen he didn't let it stop his
[57:17] forward progress he just recognized it's
[57:19] there and God permitted it it don't
[57:21] scare me I feel it coming but I'm moving
[57:23] on I'm serving God's purpose I'm serving
[57:27] God and we know that the prophet of God
[57:29] he never just let that thing control his
[57:31] life and he never just gave in to it
[57:33] when he couldn't defeated it troubled
[57:34] him amen God would have to raise him
[57:36] back up and give him strength to go back
[57:38] at it but we know on the wings of a snow
[57:40] white dove God delivered him from that
[57:42] he fought all his life against it he
[57:44] resisted it and he recognized that it's
[57:46] serving some purpose in my life so I'll
[57:48] just move on forward with it and he told
[57:51] me it won't scare me praise God I'm
[57:52] thankful for that but it's serving a
[57:54] purpose and I'm moving on but he never
[57:56] stopped trusting God to heal him amen he
[57:59] never stopped believing God would and
[58:01] God honored his faith in the end of his
[58:03] life the last 30 days of his life or
[58:06] something like that God he he come and
[58:08] preach on the wings of a snow white dove
[58:10] so his healing was before it have been
[58:11] more than 30 days but like the last two
[58:13] months of his life amen God freed him
[58:15] from that and he said I'm
[58:19] healed amen that's why we said last time
[58:22] I want to resist whatever it is that's
[58:24] hindering me I want to resist it until
[58:25] my my last final breath amen if I'm
[58:28] delivered 5 minutes before I die then so
[58:31] be it I just don't want to give in to it
[58:32] I don't want it to let it control me I
[58:34] don't want to stop my purpose because of
[58:36] whatever it is that's laying there
[58:37] whether it's my fault or permitted by
[58:39] God or whatever I just want to keep
[58:41] pressing
[58:45] on
[58:48] amen he says brother B says Christ is
[58:52] revealed in his own word in this message
[58:53] Christ is revealed in his own word he
[58:55] says I was just talking to a young
[58:56] Minister and his wife in the room just a
[58:59] few moments ago and both of them are
[59:01] nervous just like the rest of the world
[59:03] rest of the human beings on Earth I said
[59:05] remember Satan's got a Punch coming at
[59:07] you don't care who you are he's got a
[59:10] right for that one punch which which had
[59:12] you rather it be that punch be blind or
[59:15] be arthritic sitting in a chair be
[59:16] nervous he's got somewhere he can punch
[59:18] you he's got the right to that open
[59:20] place now that's the spot you got to
[59:22] keep covered all the time
[59:28] not just say well my mom was like that
[59:29] I'm like that no you got to keep that
[59:31] covered all the
[59:33] time amen you know
[59:37] I I just Envision what what it should
[59:41] have been maybe in Canaan and I this is
[59:43] just brother Chad because I could be a
[59:45] million miles from right but as a
[59:47] reflect on the the the Canaanites they
[59:49] couldn't drive out the inhabitants that
[59:51] they couldn't drive out in these pockets
[59:53] in these
[59:54] sectors and they would try
[59:56] and they would
[59:58] fail but then they said you know what
[1:00:00] this is too hard I I can't face this
[1:00:03] thing anymore it's it's difficult let's
[1:00:05] just make an agreement you stay I'll
[1:00:07] stay and we'll just forget about
[1:00:11] it but they weren't supposed to do
[1:00:14] that they were supposed to fight against
[1:00:16] it and maybe they couldn't move them
[1:00:17] this time and and maybe there's a break
[1:00:19] maybe there's a law in the fighting and
[1:00:21] maybe they raise up again and there's
[1:00:22] another battle maybe they come down off
[1:00:24] the mountain to to steal their weed or
[1:00:26] to plague them or and they fight back
[1:00:29] against it
[1:00:30] again maybe they can't have Victory but
[1:00:33] they just drive it back a little bit and
[1:00:35] then they know it's going to come again
[1:00:37] cuz it's not
[1:00:39] gone they keep plowing their land they
[1:00:41] keep tilling their land they don't make
[1:00:43] a league they're not they're not I'm not
[1:00:45] happy about that thing up there it's got
[1:00:46] to go God told us to possess the land
[1:00:48] that's our land that thing's got to go
[1:00:50] maybe they try again and fail maybe the
[1:00:52] Canaanite comes down off the hill after
[1:00:54] them and they drive them back but they
[1:00:56] failed to fully eradicate them amen but
[1:00:58] the the issue is they should never have
[1:01:00] stopped trying and they should have
[1:01:01] never have stopped doing what God called
[1:01:03] them to
[1:01:05] do amen and I can imagine this is just
[1:01:08] me as my imagination but I could imagine
[1:01:11] the Canaanites amassing the army that
[1:01:13] little pocket that been there they've
[1:01:15] been quiet for a while but now they're
[1:01:16] going to come down I could just imagine
[1:01:18] if Israel could have taken this attitude
[1:01:20] if they could have said oh the that
[1:01:22] those up on the hill there those from
[1:01:24] megiddo those from the Rocky place
[1:01:26] they're coming back down again with
[1:01:27] their iron chariots maybe this will be
[1:01:29] the time God delivers them into our hand
[1:01:32] maybe this will be the last fight maybe
[1:01:34] this will be the last time we Face see
[1:01:36] that's the right attitude friends maybe
[1:01:38] this time this will be the last time
[1:01:40] they go maybe this is the last time I
[1:01:42] have to deal with this amen not oh I
[1:01:44] just I can't ever overcome that I just
[1:01:46] please go away here take my crops and go
[1:01:48] back we got a
[1:01:50] league no sir amen you may have dealt
[1:01:53] with something for years and years you
[1:01:54] may have a health issue or you may have
[1:01:56] some issue in your life or a family
[1:01:57] issue or a trouble or complex and it
[1:02:00] comes back from time to time amen you
[1:02:02] just pick up your sword of the word and
[1:02:03] believe maybe this is the time God will
[1:02:05] deliver them into my hand maybe this is
[1:02:08] my last battle amen it may not be but
[1:02:10] why take the other attitude is I hope
[1:02:12] that goes away fast so I don't have to
[1:02:14] deal with this
[1:02:17] again God promised he would drive them
[1:02:20] out if he lets them to remain there's a
[1:02:21] purpose behind it but I'm not giving
[1:02:23] into it I'm not I'm not being overcome
[1:02:26] by it I'm not stopping I'm not going to
[1:02:27] stop doing what he told me to
[1:02:30] do maybe this is the last
[1:02:33] battle maybe you've got to fight
[1:02:36] something in your life again maybe this
[1:02:38] is the last
[1:02:40] battle you know the difference in
[1:02:42] Attitude changes so much yeah amen when
[1:02:46] you say oh no this again we're never
[1:02:48] going to get over this oh God I just
[1:02:51] hope it goes goes away fast listen
[1:02:53] that's a defeated attitude from the very
[1:02:57] beginning but oh if we could take the
[1:02:59] attitude of here it comes again maybe
[1:03:02] this is the time amen maybe God will
[1:03:04] give me Victory this time and I'm going
[1:03:05] to take the promise of God I'm going to
[1:03:07] take the word of God and I'm going to
[1:03:08] strike that thing as hard as I possibly
[1:03:10] can and if God will help me we'll drive
[1:03:12] it
[1:03:15] out and you may have that battle again
[1:03:18] and again and again but fight it with
[1:03:20] the good fight of Faith
[1:03:23] friends amen
[1:03:26] amen let's go back to the Book of Judges
[1:03:28] Judges chapter
[1:03:29] 2 I want to continue on in the story so
[1:03:33] they they failed and they put them under
[1:03:35] league and that was the problem was
[1:03:37] putting them under League not
[1:03:40] failing I I hope that you understand
[1:03:42] this friends when you resist the devil
[1:03:45] amen and you take the word and you
[1:03:46] believe the word and you don't get
[1:03:48] Deliverance right away and it doesn't
[1:03:49] look like it's working amen God's not
[1:03:52] God's not upset at you because it didn't
[1:03:54] work
[1:03:58] because you can't do anything without
[1:03:59] him
[1:04:01] anyways amen failing is not the problem
[1:04:05] it's when we stop trying that's the
[1:04:07] problem when we stop believing when we
[1:04:09] stop pushing when we stop fighting
[1:04:12] that's the
[1:04:13] problem when we put it under tribute
[1:04:15] that's why he was angry and when they
[1:04:17] put him under tribute he says now I'll
[1:04:18] not drive them out but they'll remain
[1:04:20] and be thorns in your flesh and then we
[1:04:22] go a little further in Judges chapter 2
[1:04:24] and look what he says now Judges chapter
[1:04:27] 2 verse
[1:04:29] 20 and the anger of the Lord was hot
[1:04:32] against Israel and he said because that
[1:04:34] this people hath transgressed my
[1:04:36] Covenant which I commanded their fathers
[1:04:38] and have not hearkened into my voice I
[1:04:40] also will not henceforth drive out any
[1:04:42] from from before them of the Nations
[1:04:45] which Joshua left when he died that that
[1:04:48] through them I may prove Israel whether
[1:04:51] they will keep my way of the Lord to
[1:04:53] walk therein as their fathers did or
[1:04:56] not therefore the Lord left those
[1:04:59] Nations without driving them out hastily
[1:05:02] neither delivering he them into the hand
[1:05:04] of
[1:05:05] Joshua he left
[1:05:08] them but he left them for a
[1:05:12] purpose he left them so that he could
[1:05:14] prove
[1:05:15] Israel and then if you look at that last
[1:05:17] verse again he said therefore the Lord
[1:05:20] left those Nations without driving them
[1:05:22] out hastily
[1:05:26] oh there's some hope in the word
[1:05:28] hastily that doesn't mean he'll never
[1:05:30] drive them out he just not going to
[1:05:33] drive them out hastily because now he's
[1:05:36] going to use them to prove Israel now
[1:05:39] there's a purpose in them staying there
[1:05:41] and when they fulfilled their purpose
[1:05:42] they'll be driven out amen and we know
[1:05:45] under the ministry of Solomon they were
[1:05:47] they were driven out under the son of
[1:05:49] David Ministry amen he never said it was
[1:05:52] going to be there forever he said now
[1:05:53] I'm not going to drive him out I'm not
[1:05:55] going to drive them out
[1:05:58] hastily oh praise God if you give a
[1:06:01] child of God one Speck of Hope and Faith
[1:06:03] he's going to hold on to that amen he's
[1:06:05] going to say did you read the word
[1:06:07] hastily everybody else will say he said
[1:06:08] he's not going to drive them out he
[1:06:10] won't drive them out he won't drive them
[1:06:11] out but you get somebody with faith
[1:06:13] planted down in their soul they'll look
[1:06:15] at a little word called hastily and said
[1:06:17] hey praise God he said
[1:06:20] hastily that's the difference between a
[1:06:22] Believer and an unbeliever an unbeliever
[1:06:24] will look for the to disbelieve the
[1:06:26] believer will look for the excuse to
[1:06:28] believe they'll look for the fraction
[1:06:31] the word they'll look for an exclamation
[1:06:33] point they'll look for a comma in a
[1:06:34] certain spot they're looking for a
[1:06:36] reason to trust God they're looking for
[1:06:38] a reason to believe the unbeliever is
[1:06:40] looking for a reason not to believe and
[1:06:43] God gives them plenty of
[1:06:47] reasons then you start adding up words
[1:06:50] and quotes and scriptures and he says he
[1:06:53] says don't remove won't move allow to
[1:06:56] remain he said that four times in the
[1:06:58] Book of Judges but the believer says but
[1:07:00] he said hastily
[1:07:02] once and all I need is once amen you
[1:07:05] have four times it will not remove I
[1:07:07] have one time of hastily and I believe
[1:07:09] he's going to remove this enemy
[1:07:11] [Applause]
[1:07:13] someday praise be to God but he said
[1:07:16] he'll leave them there to prove is real
[1:07:20] this word prove is the same one in the
[1:07:22] New Testament as the Old Testament it
[1:07:24] means to test to try to prove to tempt
[1:07:28] to essay to put to the proof
[1:07:31] test God why what's God looking for he's
[1:07:33] looking for Faith he's looking for
[1:07:35] somebody to believe his word and he left
[1:07:37] listen what was what was left in the
[1:07:39] land amen that he wouldn't drive out the
[1:07:41] inhabitants of the land that were
[1:07:42] embedded there that they couldn't drive
[1:07:44] out amen he would not drive them out now
[1:07:46] because now he's going to use their
[1:07:47] mistake to prove them
[1:07:53] amen see even that statement you can
[1:07:56] take a positive or A negative depends on
[1:07:59] whether you have faith or
[1:08:02] not because you can say oh they left
[1:08:04] their mistake and God's going to God's
[1:08:06] going to prove every generation now and
[1:08:08] everybody's going to fail wait a second
[1:08:12] that's not why he left them there he
[1:08:14] left them there to prove that there's
[1:08:15] still Believers here amen even under
[1:08:18] this enemy even if I leave them there
[1:08:19] and they afflict them again and again
[1:08:21] and again I'm proving that I still got
[1:08:24] true Israelites in the land there's
[1:08:26] still somebody that will fight back
[1:08:27] resist press forward believe me and stay
[1:08:30] with my word amen that's the way it does
[1:08:32] when when these inhabitants of the land
[1:08:34] absolutely corrupted the land in the
[1:08:36] Days of Elijah Under The Jezebel Ahab
[1:08:38] Ministry amen they completely had taken
[1:08:41] over they were serving all the
[1:08:42] neighboring gods they had set up temples
[1:08:44] to balum they had all this stuff that
[1:08:46] was going on Amen and and Elijah was
[1:08:49] standing against that regardless of what
[1:08:51] was going on but he got discouraged cuz
[1:08:53] he felt like he was the only one and God
[1:08:55] said I've got 7,000 that have not bail
[1:08:58] bowed the need to bail what was that he
[1:09:01] proved the
[1:09:02] 7,000 he may have proved the millions
[1:09:05] didn't believe him amen but the point of
[1:09:07] the story was he proved there was 7,000
[1:09:10] in the face of ad dter in the face of
[1:09:12] Canaanite hittite Idol idolatry there
[1:09:15] was still 7,000 that didn't bow the
[1:09:19] knee you say oh I got troubles I got
[1:09:22] problems I got things that happen in my
[1:09:23] life over and over let it prove that
[1:09:25] you're still a Believer Amen Let It
[1:09:27] prove that you believe his word you
[1:09:29] believe his promise and you're not
[1:09:30] backing down on the promise he gave you
[1:09:33] let him prove you by the result of your
[1:09:36] own
[1:09:39] mistake praise God
[1:09:42] Amen praise God you say how can God do
[1:09:44] God turns every negative into a
[1:09:50] positive now look at look at Judges
[1:09:53] chapter 3 now
[1:09:56] the story keeps unfolding it gets
[1:09:58] beautiful
[1:09:59] friends Judges chapter 3 verse
[1:10:03] 1 says now these are the Nations which
[1:10:06] the Lord left to prove Israel by them
[1:10:09] even as many of Israel as had not known
[1:10:11] all the wars of Canaan only that the
[1:10:14] generations of the children of Israel
[1:10:15] might know to teach them War at the
[1:10:18] least such as before knew nothing
[1:10:21] thereof namely the five Lords of the
[1:10:23] Philistines
[1:10:26] uh and all the Canaanites and the
[1:10:28] sidonians and the hivites and they dwelt
[1:10:30] in the Mount Lebanon from Mount B Herman
[1:10:32] into the entering in of HTH and they
[1:10:35] were to prove Israel by them to know
[1:10:37] whether they would hearken unto the
[1:10:38] Commandments of the Lord which he
[1:10:40] commanded their fathers by the hand of
[1:10:43] Moses I I think the most uh uh uh
[1:10:46] exciting part of all of this is verse
[1:10:49] one he says now these are the Nations
[1:10:51] which the Lord left to prove Israel by
[1:10:53] them even as many of Israel had not
[1:10:55] known all the wars of Canaan so he knew
[1:10:58] there was going to be another generation
[1:11:00] that didn't remember the conquest of
[1:11:02] Canaan yeah and when God had stoned the
[1:11:05] enemies when they came out of gilgal
[1:11:06] when God had driven them out and there
[1:11:09] was going to be Generations that come
[1:11:11] that didn't know he says verse two and
[1:11:14] only that the generations of the
[1:11:15] children of Israel might know to teach
[1:11:18] them War at the least such as before
[1:11:20] knew nothing
[1:11:22] thereof God says this mistake you make
[1:11:25] this failure to drive them out now I'll
[1:11:27] not drive them out but I'm going to use
[1:11:30] them to prove you whether you'll listen
[1:11:33] to the words of my words are not and I'm
[1:11:37] going to use these nations to teach your
[1:11:40] children War so that they won't forget
[1:11:42] how to
[1:11:46] fight what would happen if under brother
[1:11:48] brenham's Ministry he had eradicated all
[1:11:50] sickness and all trouble and he preached
[1:11:52] the word and the word drove out every
[1:11:54] obstacle we would ever ever faces
[1:11:55] Christians and now we come up here 60
[1:11:58] years later you know what we would be we
[1:12:00] would be soft jellyfish with nothing to
[1:12:02] prove us and nothing to test us and no
[1:12:05] faith we'd have absolutely no faith
[1:12:06] because everything was removed from us
[1:12:08] but God says you've made the mistake and
[1:12:10] what what the devil meant for evil I
[1:12:12] will intend it for good this will be the
[1:12:15] very thing that proves that you're a
[1:12:16] Believer it'll test you prove you and
[1:12:18] keep driving you back to my word and
[1:12:21] it'll be the very thing that teaches the
[1:12:22] generations to come how to fight the
[1:12:24] good fight of faith and not be overcome
[1:12:26] by Canaanites and Hittites and
[1:12:29] jebusites amen when this message came
[1:12:32] God brought us freedom he delivered us
[1:12:34] from denominations he delivered us from
[1:12:35] wrong ideas he set us absolutely free
[1:12:38] and brought us into the inheritance the
[1:12:40] promise of his word but guess what
[1:12:42] there's still embedded inhabitants
[1:12:44] there's still troubles in there we still
[1:12:46] have sickness we still have complex we
[1:12:48] still have family issu we still have all
[1:12:50] kinds of trouble why is it still there
[1:12:53] oh I'm so thankful that it's still still
[1:12:55] there so that I didn't forget how to
[1:12:57] fight that I didn't forget how to take
[1:12:59] the sword of the word and drive it to
[1:13:01] the heart of the
[1:13:03] enemy God does not want his bride in the
[1:13:06] end time to be a soft jellyfish that
[1:13:08] doesn't know how to stand In the Heat of
[1:13:10] battle and to take a sword of the word
[1:13:12] and stand upon the word regardless of
[1:13:14] what else is going on
[1:13:21] Amen the devil meant it for evil
[1:13:25] but God's going to use it for
[1:13:31] good this is what brother Benham says in
[1:13:34] the message does God change his
[1:13:36] mind says so we really believe that God
[1:13:39] never changes his mind about what he
[1:13:40] said he always keeps it true but he has
[1:13:44] a permissive will now there where the
[1:13:47] trouble lays we try to work on God's
[1:13:50] permissive will and he will permit it
[1:13:53] but also if we take permissive will
[1:13:55] though it's not right he will make his
[1:13:58] permissive will to work out together to
[1:14:00] glorify his perfect
[1:14:01] will it's what he did in Israel that's
[1:14:04] what he did for them when they failed he
[1:14:07] took the permissive will where they had
[1:14:09] they were to drive out the inhabitants
[1:14:10] and they failed and put them under
[1:14:12] tribute and he turned it to his perfect
[1:14:15] will here's what brother Bram says
[1:14:17] further there is nothing will go wrong
[1:14:20] with God hallelujah hallelujah can you
[1:14:24] include yourself in that statement even
[1:14:26] your mistakes even your failures even
[1:14:28] your genetic things you're dealing with
[1:14:29] from Grandma Grandpa there's nothing
[1:14:31] that will go wrong with
[1:14:33] God he knows just where the clock is a
[1:14:36] ticking at tonight there is nothing
[1:14:38] wrong every lick is hitting just exactly
[1:14:40] the way it should be everything we think
[1:14:43] it's wrong but he knows it's right it's
[1:14:47] supposed to be like
[1:14:49] this oh my goodness so you look back in
[1:14:52] the Book of Judges you say is it right
[1:14:53] or wrong you say what's wrong
[1:14:56] but it's right right it's wrong what
[1:14:58] they did was wrong they are wrong they
[1:15:01] repent they own up to it and they claim
[1:15:03] the responsibility for it but for God he
[1:15:06] said this is perfect I can use this for
[1:15:08] what I want to use it for it's not going
[1:15:10] to stop God's purpose it's not going to
[1:15:12] change his perfect will it's not going
[1:15:13] to change anything they were still God's
[1:15:16] promised people and God promised them
[1:15:17] the land and God was giving them the
[1:15:20] land listen you know what helps us so
[1:15:22] much in this message is that God
[1:15:24] revealed to us who really are and he
[1:15:26] took the spiritual Amnesia took the
[1:15:27] cloudiness out of our eyesight and we
[1:15:29] could realize that I came from God I'm
[1:15:31] going back to God if I'm the elected of
[1:15:33] God I was chosen in Christ before the
[1:15:34] foundation of the world my name was
[1:15:36] placed on that book an indelible ink of
[1:15:39] the blood of Jesus Christ never to be
[1:15:42] erased and so my mistakes won't change
[1:15:45] that my failure won't change that my not
[1:15:47] my inability to drive out the Canaanites
[1:15:49] won't change that and that's the
[1:15:52] Revelation we've got to have to stand in
[1:15:54] this
[1:15:55] because listen we make mistakes we're
[1:15:57] suffering from our mistakes we've got
[1:15:58] problems in family we got problems in
[1:16:00] life we got handicaps we got all kinds
[1:16:02] of stuff that we did to
[1:16:05] ourselves and if we didn't have the
[1:16:08] foundation of pre faith and
[1:16:10] predestination we would be tossed all
[1:16:12] over the place but there's got to be
[1:16:14] something that causes us to stand our
[1:16:16] ground and say no I'm not going anywhere
[1:16:18] I'm believing this word regardless of
[1:16:20] what
[1:16:23] happens and that's what this message
[1:16:25] came to do to us is to positionally
[1:16:27] place us as his children
[1:16:30] amen God through a promise he promised
[1:16:33] Israel he positionally placed them as
[1:16:35] His nation in the land they didn't have
[1:16:37] to leave they could have stayed right
[1:16:40] there and say yes there's Canaanites
[1:16:42] there yes I failed but I'm not giving
[1:16:44] into to that because I know who I am I
[1:16:47] am a child of God position he placed
[1:16:50] right here you know because of their
[1:16:52] failure every year the Philistines would
[1:16:54] come come down at the time of the judges
[1:16:56] the Philistines would come down and
[1:16:58] would ransack their barns take their
[1:17:00] wheat take their barley and Destroy them
[1:17:03] why because they made a league with them
[1:17:05] and left them there and then they grew
[1:17:06] stronger and overpowered them because
[1:17:08] they grew strong they put them under
[1:17:11] tribute right that's a false perception
[1:17:15] of strength yeah amen we are never
[1:17:19] strong enough to put sin under tribute
[1:17:22] amen or unbelief or compromise that's
[1:17:27] right so now these Philistines are
[1:17:30] coming down to ransack their farms and
[1:17:32] take their land take their
[1:17:35] crops but there was a little man named
[1:17:37] shamgar yeah and what did shamgar
[1:17:41] remember brother B dramatized we got two
[1:17:43] little scriptures in the Bible that
[1:17:44] mention shamgar but we had a prophet of
[1:17:47] God and God could lead by vision and he
[1:17:49] began to tell us that shamgar began to
[1:17:51] look around and he heard the the the the
[1:17:54] Thousand Phil phines marching down the
[1:17:55] road in armor and Spears and all the
[1:17:58] things that they had and he looked over
[1:17:59] the shabby wife and his hungry kids and
[1:18:01] he had nothing but he had what he had
[1:18:04] was what defeated the enemy and what he
[1:18:06] had was a revelation of who he was he
[1:18:09] was a Seed of Abraham he was under the
[1:18:13] circumcision seal and he was in the land
[1:18:16] that God had given
[1:18:17] him and so no matter how many times he
[1:18:20] had had his crops raided I doubt that
[1:18:22] was the first time the Philistines came
[1:18:24] because he said year after brother man
[1:18:26] said year after year they were coming
[1:18:28] and taking away and now he couldn't buy
[1:18:29] a dress for his wife and his kids were
[1:18:31] hungry and ragged and his whole Farm was
[1:18:33] dilapidated because they' been doing
[1:18:35] year after year year after year year
[1:18:38] after year but something rose up inside
[1:18:40] of him that said not this
[1:18:45] year and he took what was in his hand
[1:18:47] just the farmer's Ox goat and he took it
[1:18:50] and he and he beat them down with an ox
[1:18:52] goat I I I just would like to say I
[1:18:55] don't believe he beat them down with an
[1:18:56] ox goat I believe he beat them down in
[1:18:58] faith in who he was and in the promise
[1:19:00] of God he just happened to have an ox
[1:19:02] goat in his
[1:19:04] hand David didn't kill Goliath by a
[1:19:07] stone he killed Goliath by faith in who
[1:19:09] he was God just used a sling and a stone
[1:19:12] to accomplish the
[1:19:14] purpose amen we've got to come back to a
[1:19:17] revelation you know what I failed I've
[1:19:19] messed up I own it these things I'm
[1:19:21] suffering with are my fault not anybody
[1:19:23] else I'm not blaming anybody else it's
[1:19:25] me it's not God's fault it's my
[1:19:28] fault when brother Bram come over the
[1:19:30] knobs and got swimy head and and got
[1:19:32] sick he wasn't saying this is God's
[1:19:34] fault he said this is my fault
[1:19:37] yeah and that's all true but that
[1:19:40] doesn't change who we are that doesn't
[1:19:43] change the promise that doesn't change
[1:19:45] the way God thinks about us that doesn't
[1:19:47] change anything in the
[1:19:49] word if we can only catch the
[1:19:51] inspiration of the word and take what
[1:19:52] God's given us and fight back against
[1:19:54] those
[1:19:55] things there come a time though he had
[1:19:58] been robbed many times there came a time
[1:20:00] where he was robbed for the last
[1:20:03] time what overcame
[1:20:09] Faith
[1:20:12] amen I don't even know if I finished
[1:20:14] this
[1:20:16] quote yeah I'll read this last sends
[1:20:18] again because there's one more part he
[1:20:20] says there's nothing will go wrong with
[1:20:22] God he knows just where the clock is
[1:20:24] tick at tonight there is nothing wrong
[1:20:26] every lick is hitting just exactly the
[1:20:28] way it should be everything we think
[1:20:29] it's
[1:20:32] wrong has anybody confessed that they
[1:20:34] many times thought it was
[1:20:36] wrong it looks wrong it feels wrong we
[1:20:39] think it's
[1:20:40] wrong but there's nothing wrong because
[1:20:43] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:20:44] ordered of the
[1:20:45] lord we think it's wrong but he knows
[1:20:48] it's right it's supposed to be like this
[1:20:50] now listen that statement like at the
[1:20:52] beginning God just permitted sin to come
[1:20:56] that wasn't his perfect will he's
[1:20:58] talking about the Fall In the Garden of
[1:20:59] Eden all the way back in Eden that was
[1:21:01] permissive will not perfect will but
[1:21:04] there's no way the per permissive will
[1:21:06] cannot work right to glorify his perfect
[1:21:08] will and now we were all born by sex
[1:21:11] desire we all came wrong not according
[1:21:13] to the original way but we all came
[1:21:15] right because there's a purpose that God
[1:21:17] had in it all and God's accomplishing
[1:21:19] his great Plan of
[1:21:21] Redemption was it wrong yes did they
[1:21:23] suffer for the wrong yes are we still
[1:21:25] suffering for their wrong
[1:21:29] yes but is it working something perfect
[1:21:31] in our lives yes is it accomplishing
[1:21:33] God's purpose yes is it good for us yes
[1:21:36] is it bringing us into a greater
[1:21:37] revelation of who God is yes is it
[1:21:39] giving us more love for our savior and
[1:21:41] Redeemer yes it looks
[1:21:44] wrong but nothing's wrong with
[1:21:49] god brother B tells us the story of
[1:21:51] Jonah everything in Jonah looked wrong
[1:21:56] he preaches in a message a man running
[1:21:58] from the presence of the Lord he said
[1:22:00] remember where Jonah went God was in the
[1:22:03] boat God was in the storm God was in the
[1:22:07] fish he went on being right along with
[1:22:09] Jonah until his perfect will was
[1:22:12] done what a statement God tells Jonah to
[1:22:16] go to Nineveh Jonah Jonah does not want
[1:22:19] to go to
[1:22:20] Nineveh and we know he hates the
[1:22:22] ninevites he hates the Gentiles because
[1:22:24] after he preached the message they
[1:22:25] repented he went up and sat on the hill
[1:22:26] and watched over Waiting for God to
[1:22:28] destroy and when God didn't he got angry
[1:22:30] and bitter because God didn't destroy
[1:22:31] them God hate he Jonah hated those
[1:22:33] people right he didn't want to go there
[1:22:36] and preach and he didn't want them to be
[1:22:37] saved he said isn't this what I told you
[1:22:39] in the beginning that they would repent
[1:22:40] you would spare their lives and he was
[1:22:41] mad about
[1:22:44] it so he doesn't want to go to Nineveh
[1:22:46] so he goes to
[1:22:49] tarus so brother man's preaching a man
[1:22:51] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:22:54] he thinks he's running away from what
[1:22:57] God wants him to do he's moving away
[1:22:59] from the commission he's moving away
[1:23:00] from the calling he doesn't want to do
[1:23:02] it and listen brother Bram said God was
[1:23:05] in the boat What boat The Runaway boat
[1:23:08] yeah he was in the storm what storm the
[1:23:11] judging storm he was in the fish what
[1:23:14] fish the destroying
[1:23:19] fish he went right along being with
[1:23:21] Jonah until his perfect will was done
[1:23:25] that's right if he's ever after you you
[1:23:28] might Dodge over here and Dodge over
[1:23:30] there but you'll be miserable till you
[1:23:32] come back and do the thing you started
[1:23:34] out for him to do it the first place
[1:23:36] don't go run from the presence of God
[1:23:37] face up to him you believe it's the
[1:23:39] truth then if it's the truth it's worth
[1:23:42] living for dying for anything else and
[1:23:44] if he's ever Vindicated to you that it
[1:23:46] is the truth then we can't run from it
[1:23:48] nowhere he'll be right there just the
[1:23:50] same where will he be he'll be in the
[1:23:53] boat he'll be in the the storm he'll be
[1:23:55] in the
[1:23:57] fish listen and and don't think that
[1:24:01] that Jonah disobeyed God and he got off
[1:24:02] scott free that never happens because
[1:24:05] the storm the fish the seaweed the guts
[1:24:09] the bottom of the sea wasn't a
[1:24:15] reward it wasn't pleasant it didn't feel
[1:24:18] good it wasn't a happy place to
[1:24:20] be the feelings the emotions the Fright
[1:24:23] the ter eror the Sten
[1:24:26] the listen we don't get away with
[1:24:30] anything but nothing will stop God's
[1:24:32] purpose in our life and everything will
[1:24:34] work together for good but we don't get
[1:24:36] away with a thing so you can't look at
[1:24:39] Jonah and say oh that was such a
[1:24:40] wonderful Story how that worked out he
[1:24:42] said wonderful you should have been in
[1:24:44] the fish's
[1:24:46] belly it didn't feel so wonderful to
[1:24:51] me man we see that in people's lives go
[1:24:53] through TR tragedy and all kinds of
[1:24:55] heartache and and and things happen in
[1:24:57] families and things happen in their own
[1:24:58] lives and things happen because of our
[1:25:00] own mistakes and tragedy strikes and
[1:25:02] somehow God works it all out and in the
[1:25:04] end there's a story of redemption and
[1:25:06] you're restored and there's a
[1:25:07] restoration somebody says oh you were so
[1:25:09] lucky you were so blessed God so blessed
[1:25:11] you and you realize yes God blessed me
[1:25:13] beyond what I deserve but you have no
[1:25:15] idea what I suffered to get here that
[1:25:17] was my fault that was my doing but but I
[1:25:20] suffered
[1:25:23] friends no nobody just skates through in
[1:25:26] the message the sign of this time he
[1:25:28] he's still talking about Jonah he says
[1:25:30] and in Nineveh I am told that the whale
[1:25:33] was the sea God because he's the master
[1:25:36] of the sea he can swallow up anything
[1:25:37] and about noon time there come their God
[1:25:40] up out of the sea just open up his mouth
[1:25:42] and the prophet walks right out onto the
[1:25:44] bank no wonder they believe see they
[1:25:47] certainly they believe because the
[1:25:48] prophet that was given the message came
[1:25:50] out of their God's mouth repent or this
[1:25:52] city will perish he wasn't out of the
[1:25:55] will of the
[1:25:56] Lord he was doing just God makes
[1:25:59] everything work together for good to
[1:26:01] them that love God that's right and
[1:26:03] we're called according to his
[1:26:05] purpose was he wrong yes did it stop
[1:26:09] God's will no did God's will come
[1:26:11] through the wrong path
[1:26:14] yes listen I'm not going to be able to
[1:26:16] figure that out and you're not going to
[1:26:18] be able to figure it out but it's the
[1:26:20] truth amen
[1:26:26] there's a story that takes
[1:26:29] place in the Book of Judges Judges
[1:26:31] chapter 20 I was going to turn and read
[1:26:33] there but I don't want to take the time
[1:26:35] you can go back and read it but you're
[1:26:36] familiar most of you with the story
[1:26:38] where the levite was traveling with a
[1:26:40] concubine and he came to a city of
[1:26:43] Benjamin and in the city of Benjamin
[1:26:45] they took his concubine and abused her
[1:26:47] terribly until she died then he divided
[1:26:50] her into 12 parts and sent to the or and
[1:26:52] sent to the tribes of Israel
[1:26:55] and to declare what had been done in
[1:26:56] Benjamin and all the tribes of Israel
[1:26:58] come
[1:26:59] together and they come together and they
[1:27:01] said there has to be a judgment this
[1:27:02] thing cannot remain in Israel we can't
[1:27:04] let this
[1:27:05] stay so they decide that they're all
[1:27:08] going to go and fight and Destroy
[1:27:11] Benjamin and it's it's interesting when
[1:27:13] you read through the story and like I
[1:27:15] said I'm not going to take the time to
[1:27:16] go through it but go back and read
[1:27:19] Judges chapter 20
[1:27:21] sometime and they asked the Lord they
[1:27:23] inquired of the Lord they said Lord who
[1:27:26] should go up first among us to
[1:27:28] battle and the Lord said Judah shall go
[1:27:31] first so they've got God's instruction
[1:27:34] for the battle they're going to go for
[1:27:36] righteous reasons they're going to go to
[1:27:38] clean keep Israel clean and clean out
[1:27:41] this iniquity from Israel and God even
[1:27:43] tells them who will go first to battle
[1:27:46] you know if that ever happens to us we'd
[1:27:47] be like oh we got the battle plan we
[1:27:49] know who goes first Victory is
[1:27:51] assured the scripture said they went to
[1:27:54] fight against Benjamin and Benjamin
[1:27:55] prevailed over them they turned their
[1:27:57] backs again and Benjamin hewed to the
[1:27:59] ground
[1:28:00] 25,000 of the nation of
[1:28:03] Israel they came back they come back to
[1:28:06] Camp they set the battle in Array they
[1:28:08] went and wept before the Lord and said
[1:28:09] Lord amen what basically you're saying
[1:28:12] Lord what's wrong what's wrong they said
[1:28:16] God should we go up again tomorrow or
[1:28:19] should we
[1:28:20] stop and God says go again y Oh Praise
[1:28:24] God we heard from the Lord we got
[1:28:26] Victory coming tomorrow you know the
[1:28:28] story they go out to battle the next day
[1:28:30] the same exact thing happens the second
[1:28:32] day is the first day now the second day
[1:28:34] amen Benjamin fights against them and
[1:28:37] and they turn their back to Benjamin and
[1:28:38] Benjamin Hues to the ground
[1:28:41] 18,000 25,000 the first day 18,000 the
[1:28:45] second day they're they're losing by
[1:28:47] droves I mean a massive casualty count
[1:28:50] yeah they come back to the next time to
[1:28:53] the Lord they inquired of the Lord
[1:28:55] before the yman Thum and they said God
[1:28:57] Amen what shall we go or shall we not
[1:29:01] go I mean you would ask the same
[1:29:04] question I would ask the same question
[1:29:06] we would all be saying what's wrong
[1:29:08] what's not working something's wrong
[1:29:11] somewhere but God says go up then he
[1:29:15] says for tomorrow I'll deliver them
[1:29:18] under your
[1:29:21] hand that phrase changes everything yeah
[1:29:24] before he just says send Judah first
[1:29:25] okay we send Judah first just do what he
[1:29:27] says yeah and don't add to it he never
[1:29:30] promised them a victory he just told him
[1:29:32] who should go first so they should have
[1:29:34] done exactly what he said come back the
[1:29:36] next day oh God what should we do he
[1:29:37] said go up he didn't say they'd win he
[1:29:39] just said go up they're obeying the Lord
[1:29:41] and walking in his Commandments doing
[1:29:43] what the God told him to do and yet
[1:29:45] they're
[1:29:47] losing seemingly it's not
[1:29:50] working but then the third time he says
[1:29:52] go up for tomorrow
[1:29:54] I'll deliver them into your hands and
[1:29:57] they went up the third time and it's
[1:29:58] interesting the way it reads in the Book
[1:30:00] of Judges when you read it they go up
[1:30:02] the third day and in the third day amen
[1:30:05] they they decide that they're going to
[1:30:06] have some people waiting to Ambush the
[1:30:08] city they're going to try to draw the
[1:30:09] Benjamin uh The Tribe of Benjamin away
[1:30:11] from the city and they send just a small
[1:30:13] army in front of Benjamin and and then
[1:30:15] when Benjamin comes out they turn and
[1:30:17] run and this is what Benjamin says says
[1:30:21] look they run before us as
[1:30:29] before as
[1:30:31] before and as they went chasing after
[1:30:33] them the layers and weight the ambushers
[1:30:35] they went into the City and began
[1:30:36] burning the city then they turned back
[1:30:38] and they they turned together and they
[1:30:39] destroyed almost all of Benjamin all but
[1:30:42] 600 men yeah they completely wiped out
[1:30:46] you say what was wrong before who sinned
[1:30:49] before what did they get wrong in the
[1:30:50] instruction before
[1:30:52] nothing they did what God said they lost
[1:30:55] they did what God said they lost just
[1:30:57] because you do what God says doesn't
[1:30:59] mean you're going to get instant results
[1:31:01] doesn't mean amen that you're going to
[1:31:03] turn around overnight amen but what he
[1:31:05] was doing was drawing the enemy to a
[1:31:07] false sense of security we got 25,000
[1:31:10] the first day 18,000 now look they're
[1:31:12] running away from us yeah just like
[1:31:15] before they didn't leave anybody to
[1:31:17] defend the city they all come spilling
[1:31:19] out God had trained them to fall into
[1:31:22] his trap yeah right right amen nothing's
[1:31:26] wrong everything's right maybe God's
[1:31:28] training the devil to fall into his trap
[1:31:30] for you amen don't doubt the word don't
[1:31:34] doubt God Amen if you do what God says
[1:31:36] and you don't get the results you expect
[1:31:38] just expect different results
[1:31:40] tomorrow we don't know why God's doing
[1:31:43] what he's doing but God is doing
[1:31:45] something in our
[1:31:47] lives we can come up with all kinds of
[1:31:49] analysis and this and that and but
[1:31:52] forget it just do what he said and
[1:31:53] believe him and trust in him amen and
[1:31:56] ask him should we do it yes believe the
[1:31:58] word always believe the word stand on
[1:32:00] the promise always stand on the promise
[1:32:02] and at some point God's going to deliver
[1:32:05] them into their
[1:32:07] hands amen there are those stories like
[1:32:10] that where it seems like everything's
[1:32:12] going wrong and you wouldn't you
[1:32:13] wouldn't criticize anybody for doubting
[1:32:16] you wouldn't criticize them for saying
[1:32:18] maybe we shouldn't do it again I know
[1:32:20] God said go up but he said go up before
[1:32:23] right
[1:32:24] and now 18,000 of our friends are dead
[1:32:27] yeah I know you said the scripture says
[1:32:29] this but we tried that before and it
[1:32:31] didn't work for my grandma and it didn't
[1:32:32] work for my mom and it didn't work Hey
[1:32:34] listen I don't care how many times God
[1:32:36] doesn't make it work out for different
[1:32:38] circumstances he's got a reason behind
[1:32:40] all of it but if God said it I'm going
[1:32:42] to stand with it and believe it and
[1:32:44] believe it to come to pass in my
[1:32:47] life brother says in the message Jehovah
[1:32:50] Gyra he says he was going to give his
[1:32:52] Abraham a double test he said Abraham
[1:32:54] take thy son thine only son and take him
[1:32:56] to a certain Mountain where I'm going to
[1:32:58] show you and there sacrifice him now
[1:33:00] what if Abraham would have took the
[1:33:02] second thought how am I going to be a
[1:33:04] father of Nations when here I I am this
[1:33:07] old and you're asking me to kill and
[1:33:08] destroy the only evidence that I have
[1:33:10] that you'll keep your word and make me a
[1:33:12] father of Nations that's
[1:33:15] reasonings God had promised him his son
[1:33:18] he waited 25 years for the son now he
[1:33:20] hears 13 years later and God tells him
[1:33:22] to go kill his son
[1:33:25] and then look what brother M says how
[1:33:28] God loves to test his
[1:33:31] people God loves to test his people

[1:34:03] word he's kept it now for thousands of
[1:34:05] years to every believer amen oh brother

[1:35:55] him to pick up sticks you know what's
[1:35:57] you know what's in store Hey listen God
[1:35:59] is a good father and he knows what's in
[1:36:01] store and he knows what he's doing in
[1:36:03] our
[1:36:06] lives so if God's not feeling sorry for
[1:36:08] me why am I feeling sorry for
[1:36:14] me self-pity is a
[1:36:16] disease it's handicapping it's blinding
[1:36:21] and it destroys us right
[1:36:24] Romans 8:28 says and we know that all
[1:36:26] things work together for good to them
[1:36:29] that love God to them who are the called
[1:36:32] according to his purpose by this message
[1:36:34] we believe that we fit into this
[1:36:36] category that we are the called
[1:36:38] according to his purpose that means all
[1:36:41] things I've said this many times but
[1:36:43] I'll say it again does anybody know the
[1:36:45] definition of
[1:36:47] all it's different than some and it's
[1:36:50] different than most it's all
[1:36:54] all things work together for
[1:36:58] good brother B goes on to say but if the
[1:37:02] people won't walk in his perfect will he
[1:37:04] does have a permissive will he'll let
[1:37:05] you walk in notice he permits it all
[1:37:08] right but he will make it work out for
[1:37:10] his glory and his perfect
[1:37:13] will some of us suffer like Israel did
[1:37:16] the things they did in the permissive
[1:37:18] will of God and they suffered for the
[1:37:20] decisions they made we suffer for the
[1:37:23] decisions we made but that suffering
[1:37:27] will work for the glory of his perfect
[1:37:31] will it
[1:37:33] will I'd like to look back at the
[1:37:35] prophet's life remember I started by
[1:37:37] sharing my appreciation for God giving
[1:37:40] us an example of a Son of God showing
[1:37:44] what a Son of God with the restored
[1:37:46] truth with faith with God working
[1:37:48] through him should look like and it
[1:37:51] helps me so much when we come into
[1:37:53] difficult times and things of we don't
[1:37:55] understand or can't comprehend just to
[1:37:57] see how God trained and raised and used
[1:38:01] that Son of
[1:38:03] God in the message Shalom from 1964 the
[1:38:06] prophet says many people ask why they
[1:38:09] ask sometimes they ask me why why must
[1:38:12] these things happen what why why did
[1:38:15] this happen to me why did I start out
[1:38:18] and this happened and I had this trouble
[1:38:19] here and this upset me here and I lost
[1:38:22] this here
[1:38:24] sometimes I've asked why why when I was
[1:38:27] just a young Minister first started out
[1:38:29] did God take my wife right out from
[1:38:30] under me take my baby right from beneath
[1:38:33] me right beneath my heart why did he do
[1:38:36] that I don't know I do now he says I
[1:38:40] didn't know I do
[1:38:42] now here comes the prophet of God
[1:38:45] and the if you step back to the place he
[1:38:48] was when he was a young man in his early
[1:38:51] 20s trying to serve God starting a
[1:38:54] church preaching the
[1:38:56] gospel and right in that early stage of
[1:38:58] his life he failed to go out when God
[1:39:02] called him and he listened to his
[1:39:04] mother-in-law and one of the
[1:39:06] consequences for that action is he lost
[1:39:09] his wife and he lost his
[1:39:12] baby and even hope when she come back he
[1:39:16] went and he found her she was laying
[1:39:17] there she had just slipped away and he
[1:39:18] called her back and she asked why did
[1:39:20] you call me back Bill she begins to
[1:39:22] describe to him the other side and she
[1:39:24] says you know where we made our mistake
[1:39:26] don't you we should have never listened
[1:39:28] to
[1:39:32] Mama this
[1:39:34] brother listen he failed he went into
[1:39:38] the permissive will of God but did it
[1:39:41] work out to the glory of God's perfect
[1:39:43] will did we see it we witnessed it did
[1:39:47] it hurt yes did it affect him the rest
[1:39:51] of his life if you don't think so go
[1:39:53] listen to life story from 1951 and again
[1:39:56] in 1959 and he's weeping so hard at the
[1:39:59] end he can't finish his life
[1:40:01] story don't think that that didn't cost
[1:40:04] him but it all worked together for good
[1:40:08] and brother B said I didn't know I
[1:40:10] didn't understand why he let that happen
[1:40:11] I didn't know I do now I just held my
[1:40:16] hand in his and kept trusting
[1:40:20] amen he knows every Junction he knows
[1:40:23] the Rhythm when it must take place he
[1:40:26] knows what it takes to mold you he knows
[1:40:29] what kind of material he's going to
[1:40:31] use see
[1:40:34] how wonderful it is to have a
[1:40:38] prophet who will come to one of the most
[1:40:41] horrific things in his life to one of
[1:40:43] the most troubling things that have ever
[1:40:44] happened to him to lose in this short
[1:40:47] period of time his young wife and his
[1:40:49] young baby so much so that he tried to
[1:40:52] commit suicide twice and he was angry
[1:40:54] cuz God wouldn't let him die he was that
[1:40:56] miserable friends this wasn't this isn't
[1:40:59] just a story this is a man who has to
[1:41:00] live through these things and he knows
[1:41:03] it was his mistake he gets caught in the
[1:41:05] flood with his little boat and he's
[1:41:07] heading for the falls and he can't get
[1:41:09] his engine started amen and you know
[1:41:10] what he's saying he realizes while he's
[1:41:13] floating towards the Falls till
[1:41:15] destruction amen trying to crank that
[1:41:17] motor he starts to repent and said God
[1:41:19] I'm sorry I failed I should have never
[1:41:21] listened to my mother-in-law I should
[1:41:22] have went out when you called me and he
[1:41:25] repented and he made it right and after
[1:41:27] he repented and recognized his failure
[1:41:29] he pulled that engine and it took off
[1:41:30] and got to
[1:41:32] safety but in the same flood in the same
[1:41:35] storm in the same period of time he lost
[1:41:37] his wife and he lost his
[1:41:40] baby why why do these things have to
[1:41:43] happen here he comes at the end of his
[1:41:46] life this is 1964 he comes he's 55 years
[1:41:50] old at this time and he says he knows
[1:41:53] every
[1:41:54] Junction why did why did he do that I
[1:41:57] didn't know I do now I just held my hand
[1:42:00] in his and trusted but look what he says
[1:42:02] next he knows what it takes to mold
[1:42:07] you he knows what kind of material he's
[1:42:10] going to use see the backside of the
[1:42:13] desert sometimes where God molds
[1:42:14] righteous men into sages and Prophets
[1:42:16] see that's where men are beat out men
[1:42:19] are beat out in the word when they get
[1:42:20] all kind of creed and stuff in them let
[1:42:22] them come to the word and God beats it
[1:42:24] right out of them molds it right into
[1:42:26] this into the great sympathy of his word
[1:42:29] and then they see the word moving on God
[1:42:32] knows when the rhythm of it has got to
[1:42:34] change he knows how the Rhythm goes I
[1:42:36] don't know how it goes but he knows he
[1:42:39] knows how it goes I don't but I look at
[1:42:41] it here and I say well it's just coming
[1:42:44] many are the afflictions of the
[1:42:45] righteous but God deliver them out of
[1:42:47] them all God has moved through history
[1:42:49] with the rhythm of the promise of the
[1:42:51] word in each age in some in the same
[1:42:54] Rhythm making his
[1:42:59] word why why did it have to go that way
[1:43:02] why did he have to make that mistake why
[1:43:04] did he have to listen to his
[1:43:05] mother-in-law
[1:43:07] why and I don't know that I can answer
[1:43:09] all the reasons why or all the things
[1:43:12] that God accomplished with that but one
[1:43:14] thing for no brother Ben had to repent
[1:43:16] of and he said it was wrong but that
[1:43:18] wrong worked together for
[1:43:20] right because we had a man who was
[1:43:22] molded by those those things and he was
[1:43:24] changed by those things that he suffered
[1:43:26] and then God got a man in his hand that
[1:43:28] would stick with his word he got a man
[1:43:30] would go regardless of what anybody said
[1:43:32] would preach what he was told regardless
[1:43:34] of what anybody said about it because he
[1:43:36] knew what it was like to listen to other
[1:43:38] voices and not listen to the voice of
[1:43:39] God he knew so deeply he knew he felt it
[1:43:43] to the core of his soul he knew how
[1:43:46] deeply that hurt Amen to disobey God and
[1:43:49] now he wasn't going to do it again and
[1:43:50] as if that wasn't enough every time he
[1:43:52] come over the knobs and come back into
[1:43:54] Jeffersonville he got sick again just to
[1:43:55] remind him you must follow the word of
[1:43:58] the
[1:43:59] Lord it looks like it's all wrong but
[1:44:02] it's not all wrong it looks like it it's
[1:44:04] just pain for no reason but it's not
[1:44:07] pain for no reason God is working all
[1:44:09] things together for
[1:44:12] good and I hate that the prophet
[1:44:14] suffered that personally as a human
[1:44:17] being I hate when I think about the way
[1:44:19] he describes his little daughter and the
[1:44:21] suffering and it just tears into pieces
[1:44:23] I can't listen to his life life story
[1:44:25] without
[1:44:26] crying but I'm so thankful God molded
[1:44:29] him where would we be if God didn't work
[1:44:32] in his life if God didn't prove him if
[1:44:34] God didn't test him if God didn't build
[1:44:36] his faith if God never corrected him
[1:44:38] where would you and I be and where would
[1:44:40] others be if God never proved us and
[1:44:42] corrected us and molded us and made us
[1:44:45] into what he wants us to be the molding
[1:44:47] isn't always easy but the molding is
[1:44:49] necessary and God will take everything
[1:44:51] that's in our life to mold us into the
[1:44:53] character that he wants us to have even
[1:44:55] our mistakes even when we went to
[1:44:56] permissive will and caused oursel heaps
[1:44:59] of pain God will use that pain to mold
[1:45:01] us not just for us but for somebody
[1:45:05] else I can't I'm I hurt for the prophet
[1:45:09] when I hear him hurt but I can't help
[1:45:11] but thank God that God loved me enough
[1:45:13] that he would do something like
[1:45:16] that sometimes we got to fly On Eagle's
[1:45:19] Wings and get a little higher so that we
[1:45:20] can put things in
[1:45:21] perspective because when we're looking
[1:45:23] at incident by incident and Circumstance
[1:45:25] by circumstance it seems overwhelming
[1:45:27] and impossible and all wrong and
[1:45:29] everything's wrong amen but you got to
[1:45:31] fly a little higher up to where God is
[1:45:33] and see with God's eyes and say there
[1:45:34] isn't anything wrong all of these wrongs
[1:45:37] are going to work together for right and
[1:45:38] nothing's going to do nothing is going
[1:45:40] to stop God's will in fact everything
[1:45:42] would work together to glor to bring
[1:45:44] glory to his perfect
[1:45:47] will Ecclesiastes can you turn to with
[1:45:50] me to Ecclesiastes we're just just about
[1:45:53] done we're going to wrap up right
[1:45:56] here let's turn to
[1:46:00] Ecclesiastes it's uh Proverbs uh I mean
[1:46:04] Psalms Proverbs
[1:46:06] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:46:15] 7 verse
[1:46:20] one Ecclesiastes 7:1 a good name is
[1:46:23] better than precious ointment and the
[1:46:25] day of death than the day of one's
[1:46:27] birth it is better to go to the house of
[1:46:30] mourning than to go to the house of
[1:46:33] feasting for that is the end of all men
[1:46:36] and the living will lay it to his heart
[1:46:38] sorrow is better than laughter for by
[1:46:41] the sadness of the countenance The Heart
[1:46:43] Is Made
[1:46:46] better the heart of the wise is in the
[1:46:48] house of mourning but the heart of fools
[1:46:50] is in the house of Mirth it is better to
[1:46:52] hear the rebuke of the wise than for a
[1:46:54] man to hear the song of fools for as the
[1:46:58] crackling of thorns under a pot so is
[1:47:00] the laughter of the fool this also is
[1:47:04] Vanity Solomon wrote these words Solomon
[1:47:07] was the wisest man that ever lived on
[1:47:09] earth outside Jesus
[1:47:12] Christ and Solomon is telling us the
[1:47:17] truth and the truth is it's better to go
[1:47:21] to the house of mour than to the house
[1:47:23] of
[1:47:25] feasting you know what we never
[1:47:27] voluntarily go to the house of
[1:47:29] mourning but we'll stand in line to go
[1:47:32] to the house of Mirth and the house of
[1:47:34] feasting that's just human nature you
[1:47:37] can sell tickets and pay people will pay
[1:47:39] a high price to go to the house of Mirth
[1:47:41] and the house of feasting because that's
[1:47:44] what we want and to have laughter and to
[1:47:46] tell jokes and to laugh and have a good
[1:47:47] time and feel good amen but he says that
[1:47:50] laughter is like Thorns crackling under
[1:47:52] a pot there's no does to it it's gone in
[1:47:53] the flash how many times have you been
[1:47:56] in a good time a happy time been to a
[1:47:58] party or been to somebody's house and
[1:48:00] amen and then you leave and five minutes
[1:48:02] later you get bad news and all that
[1:48:04] laughter just went up like
[1:48:08] smoke God
[1:48:10] knows God knows what's best for
[1:48:13] us God knows what changes us God knows
[1:48:17] what makes us stop and reflect on what's
[1:48:21] inside God knows to stop us and make us
[1:48:24] consider who we are and where we're
[1:48:26] going and what we're
[1:48:28] doing and the house of morning is better
[1:48:31] than the house of Earth you know what
[1:48:33] nobody stands in line to go to the house
[1:48:35] of
[1:48:35] mour you don't sell tickets nobody pays
[1:48:38] a price he pay great sums of money to go
[1:48:41] to a ball game to shout and have a good
[1:48:43] time and accomplish absolutely nothing
[1:48:45] yeah but nobody will pay money to go to
[1:48:47] the house of morning which will actually
[1:48:49] change their life yeah right which will
[1:48:52] actually make them think deeper we
[1:48:54] actually make them consider what life is
[1:48:56] all about and who I am and who God
[1:48:59] is amen it's the times that crush us are
[1:49:02] the times that mold
[1:49:03] us it's the times that absolutely strip
[1:49:06] us to nothing are the very things that
[1:49:08] make us who we are not the jovial times
[1:49:11] and the LA we thank God for those times
[1:49:14] God had feasting days and God had
[1:49:15] rejoicing times and there was always
[1:49:17] good things that happen but you can't
[1:49:19] you can't grow in the good times you
[1:49:21] grow actually in the Hard
[1:49:25] Times Solomon goes on to say sorrow is
[1:49:29] better than
[1:49:32] laughter listen just underline in your
[1:49:34] Bible memorize it in your mind just
[1:49:37] recognize that that is the truth amen
[1:49:40] and then you say why is it always one
[1:49:42] struggle to another and a hardship after
[1:49:44] another because sorrow is better than
[1:49:46] laughter because the house of mourning
[1:49:49] is better than the house of feasting
[1:49:50] because God knows how to mold Us in the
[1:49:53] fiery flames of Affliction to make us
[1:49:55] what he puts something inside of us and
[1:49:58] that thing that inside of us will not
[1:50:00] rise up under mirth and under feastings
[1:50:02] and under marment what he put down
[1:50:04] inside of us his own character it'll
[1:50:06] come up under adversity and under
[1:50:08] Affliction and in difficult
[1:50:11] times look at the prophet of God look at
[1:50:13] the first stage of his life and look at
[1:50:15] how hard his life was look at the
[1:50:17] rejection look at having an alcoholic
[1:50:19] father and the rejection from the
[1:50:20] neighborhood the poverty and all the
[1:50:22] things that he had to suffer with what
[1:50:24] was God doing God was doing the best
[1:50:26] thing he could do for that man to
[1:50:28] prepare him to carry the
[1:50:31] word and it looks horrible and we would
[1:50:34] prevent anybody from going through
[1:50:36] that but God didn't prevent it God
[1:50:39] ordained it y That's why I ask people I
[1:50:43] tell people all the time when when I
[1:50:45] when I learn what they're going through
[1:50:46] the struggles in life I'm saying I'm so
[1:50:48] glad God didn't ask me to pick what to
[1:50:50] do because I would have you bypass all
[1:50:52] of of it bypass death in the family
[1:50:55] bypass rejection bypass comple I would
[1:50:58] have you bypass every difficult thing
[1:51:00] that happened in your life cuz I hate to
[1:51:01] watch you
[1:51:02] suffer but God didn't bypass it and God
[1:51:06] knew it what he was doing for us was the
[1:51:08] best thing that he could do for us is he
[1:51:10] would cause us to stop and reflect on
[1:51:13] who he is what his word is where we're
[1:51:15] going and what it's doing for us because
[1:51:17] sorrow is better than laughter
[1:51:25] it produces more than
[1:51:30] laughter Hard Times build character more
[1:51:32] than good times look at the character of
[1:51:35] the United States this is a character
[1:51:37] brother saying the character of leodan
[1:51:41] characterless yeah do you know who had
[1:51:44] character those who were alive during
[1:51:46] the Great
[1:51:47] Depression right y true those that went
[1:51:50] through the wars yeah and knew what it
[1:51:52] was to sacrifice and be be on ration
[1:51:55] tickets and not have enough and to be
[1:51:58] hungry and to have to work hours and
[1:51:59] hours and
[1:52:01] hours those are the ones who had cared
[1:52:04] those are the ones who built this
[1:52:05] country and we living on the riches that
[1:52:07] they built and now we have no character
[1:52:09] in our society because they're living in
[1:52:12] frivolity and Mart and
[1:52:14] mirth
[1:52:16] right how did they get there because
[1:52:18] there was a generation before that went
[1:52:20] through sorrow and hardship and
[1:52:22] difficulty and
[1:52:24] adversity you know the only thing that
[1:52:26] could save this America which we know it
[1:52:27] can't be saved but if God wanted to save
[1:52:29] it the only thing he could do to save it
[1:52:30] was absolutely collapse it and crush it
[1:52:33] and bring
[1:52:35] hardship so that he could bring
[1:52:36] character back to the people so that he
[1:52:38] could save it yeah that's what he did to
[1:52:40] Israel they got up and one generation
[1:52:43] come amen the generation that knew
[1:52:44] Joshua they held to the law they did
[1:52:46] what they could but another generation
[1:52:48] came and when that generation died they
[1:52:50] went back to Mart to mirth and to all
[1:52:52] the benefits that the generation of them
[1:52:54] before worked for and then they go into
[1:52:56] frivolity and Mart and joy and pleasure
[1:52:59] they lose it all am me God crushes them
[1:53:02] sends them Army to destroy them or takes
[1:53:04] them away captive just so he could give
[1:53:06] them hardship and affliction so they
[1:53:08] could build character so he could bring
[1:53:10] them back into his land to start
[1:53:11] rebuilding it
[1:53:15] again is it a good
[1:53:18] plan it's a good plan
[1:53:22] I say God mold
[1:53:25] me like I don't I don't like the house
[1:53:29] of
[1:53:30] Sorrow I don't I don't think any of us
[1:53:33] like
[1:53:34] it which one of us want to go to the
[1:53:36] house of Sorrow we give you an option
[1:53:38] House of Mirth House of Sorrow I'm going
[1:53:40] to the house of Mirth I can hear them
[1:53:44] laughing but God knows what we
[1:53:48] need sometimes we even make mistakes we
[1:53:52] fail
[1:53:53] we do things wrong sometimes God lets
[1:53:55] enemies stay in our land because those
[1:53:59] enemies will help mold us into what he
[1:54:01] wants us to
[1:54:02] be it'll teach us to fight it'll prove
[1:54:06] that we still believe God's using all of
[1:54:09] these things for something
[1:54:12] good and I'd like to wrap up an end with
[1:54:14] this
[1:54:15] story in brother R's life story from
[1:54:19] 1951 he he says this
[1:54:23] he talking about going down into the
[1:54:25] basement and seeing his baby little
[1:54:26] Sharon Rose so sick and Afflicted and
[1:54:31] dying he said and the Flies was in her
[1:54:33] little baby eyes and I shooted the Flies
[1:54:36] off of her eyes like that and looked
[1:54:37] down at her and said Sharon Rose honey
[1:54:40] you're not going to leave Daddy are
[1:54:42] you remember his wife is already dead at
[1:54:45] this
[1:54:46] point and I looked at her little old fat
[1:54:49] legs her little crippled hand like this
[1:54:52] and like that as she was drawing
[1:54:54] quivering and she was looking at me
[1:54:56] little old lips quivering I said Sharon
[1:54:59] are you going to leave
[1:55:01] Daddy and looked like she was quivering
[1:55:04] so like that she looked up at me she was
[1:55:06] suffering so hard till one of those
[1:55:09] little baby eyes her little eyes was
[1:55:11] crossed like that look at her suffering
[1:55:13] so and she was looked like she was
[1:55:15] trying to she was trying to reach her
[1:55:18] little hands to
[1:55:20] me oh it just tore pour my heart out of
[1:55:25] me I don't know that any of us
[1:55:28] understands what this feels
[1:55:31] like but that man was being
[1:55:34] destroyed
[1:55:36] crushed and
[1:55:39] molded just tore my heart out of me Oh I
[1:55:42] thought oh God from that
[1:55:44] day and you think nothing good can come
[1:55:48] from something like that it's just
[1:55:50] suffering it's just pain it's just it's
[1:55:52] an Affliction that's impossible to
[1:55:57] overcome but everything produces
[1:56:00] something good everything turns for the
[1:56:04] good listen what he says next and this
[1:56:06] is the part that just began to I don't
[1:56:09] know do something to
[1:56:11] me he said oh God from that day that's
[1:56:15] the reason crossy children oh I just
[1:56:17] can't stand to look at them you
[1:56:19] know God does those things sometimes he
[1:56:22] has to crush something to get the good
[1:56:24] out of it isn't that right that's right
[1:56:28] brother B just talking about the story
[1:56:31] of his little Afflicted 18-month-old
[1:56:33] baby so Afflicted She's suffering her
[1:56:35] hands withered up she's quivering like
[1:56:38] she's trying to reach out to him like
[1:56:39] she's trying to look at him and her eyes
[1:56:40] crossed She's suffering so bad and
[1:56:43] brother bam relates it to cross-eyed
[1:56:46] children he says and God does those
[1:56:48] things that's what he's saying God does
[1:56:50] those things
[1:56:53] sometimes he has to crush something to
[1:56:56] get the good out of it isn't that
[1:56:59] right in blind Bar M he says there was a
[1:57:03] little cross-eyed boy was
[1:57:05] next I've never in my life ever seen God
[1:57:08] turn a crosseyed child
[1:57:11] down I guess why because when my baby
[1:57:14] when I was just a boy I lost my wife and
[1:57:16] baby you know and the little girl
[1:57:18] suffered so hard till her eyes crossed
[1:57:20] and I just passed out almost looking at
[1:57:22] her
[1:57:23] and I never could stand to see a child
[1:57:25] crosseyed lord always answered prayer
[1:57:28] for
[1:57:29] that brother brandham had to suffer
[1:57:32] watching his afflicted baby so severely
[1:57:36] suffering that her eyes crossed until it
[1:57:38] nearly it tore his heart out it nearly
[1:57:40] killed him but you know what it produced
[1:57:43] It produced in him something of
[1:57:45] compassion a
[1:57:48] love and he
[1:57:50] says I've never in my life seen God turn
[1:57:54] a crosseyed child
[1:57:57] down you know what the world was full of
[1:58:01] cross-eyed
[1:58:03] children and not all of them got
[1:58:05] healed but every single one that came to
[1:58:09] this
[1:58:10] man was
[1:58:12] healed why because he was molded in the
[1:58:15] fiery flames of Affliction and it did
[1:58:17] something to him and and he couldn't
[1:58:20] stand to see it and because he couldn't
[1:58:21] stand stand to see it something in him
[1:58:23] Greed for that child and something
[1:58:25] because of what he suffered through it
[1:58:27] gave him a compassion and a desire to
[1:58:29] see this child and he labored with that
[1:58:30] child until God answered his prayer of
[1:58:32] faith and God healed every single one of
[1:58:34] them amen you know what brother brandham
[1:58:37] had to suffer with a cross-eyed child
[1:58:38] but you know how many M and daddies were
[1:58:41] glad that that suffering produced
[1:58:44] something God had to crush something to
[1:58:45] get something good out of him how many
[1:58:48] hundreds maybe thousands of severely
[1:58:50] cross-eyed children remember Dawson
[1:58:51] Riley testimony he went to a meeting
[1:58:53] when he was just a boy with his parents
[1:58:55] and he said it was a little girl was
[1:58:56] sitting in front of him and she turned
[1:58:57] around to look at him he said her eyes
[1:58:59] were severely crossy turned in and up
[1:59:01] severely and he said he felt so bad for
[1:59:03] her cuz he himself was just a little boy
[1:59:06] he said her number got called she went
[1:59:07] into prayer line she went through the
[1:59:09] prayer line and she come back and when
[1:59:10] she come back and sat down in front of
[1:59:12] him she turned around and said her eyes
[1:59:14] were pretty and normal and straight you
[1:59:16] know how many blessings have hit parents
[1:59:18] how many blessings have hit kids how
[1:59:20] many people have been touched and
[1:59:21] blessed why because God would crush one
[1:59:24] man for the benefit of many and that was
[1:59:27] just one aspect of that crushing that
[1:59:29] blessed many how many other things came
[1:59:31] out of those times of hardship for the
[1:59:33] prophet how many other things that
[1:59:34] benefit and bless us where he learned to
[1:59:37] obey he learned to suffer he learned to
[1:59:40] obey
[1:59:42] God I say praise
[1:59:44] God if God can do it for a prophet he
[1:59:47] can do it for you and
[1:59:48] I if God can crush us to bring something
[1:59:51] out of us maybe what he's bringing out
[1:59:52] of us isn't even for us cuz brother
[1:59:54] brandom could never pray for his little
[1:59:56] girl's eyes again but he could pray for
[1:59:58] every other little child with cross eyes
[2:00:00] right maybe God lets us go through
[2:00:03] things for a reason and maybe it's not
[2:00:04] just for us amen maybe what God's
[2:00:08] molding in US isn't just for us maybe
[2:00:10] it's for us and for someone
[2:00:13] else but he knows what he's doing he
[2:00:16] knows why He's doing it we just have to
[2:00:19] put our hand in his and trust
[2:00:20] him I want to read one last scripture
[2:00:23] together let's go to 2
[2:00:32] Corinthians 2
[2:00:34] Corinthians chapter
[2:00:43] 1 2 Corinthians chapter 1
[2:00:48] verse3 blessed be God even the father of
[2:00:51] our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[2:00:52] mercies and the God of All
[2:00:54] Comfort who comforted Us in all our
[2:00:58] tribulation that we may be able to
[2:01:00] comfort them which are in any trouble by
[2:01:03] the Comfort wherewith we ourselves are
[2:01:05] comforted of
[2:01:07] God for as the sufferings of Christ
[2:01:10] abound in us so our consolation also
[2:01:13] aboundeth by Christ and whether we be
[2:01:16] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[2:01:18] salvation which is effectual in the
[2:01:21] enduring of the same same sufferings
[2:01:22] which we also suffer or whether we be
[2:01:24] comforted it is for your consolation and
[2:01:28] salvation the Apostle Paul now is is
[2:01:31] laying down a super important
[2:01:34] principle he said blessed be the God of
[2:01:38] All Comfort who comforteth
[2:01:44] us comforteth us in all our
[2:01:47] tribulation why that we might be able to
[2:01:50] comfort them which are in any way
[2:01:52] troubled Paul just realized he was going
[2:01:55] through trouble you don't need comforted
[2:01:57] unless you got trouble he wasn't being
[2:02:00] comforted for
[2:02:01] nothing he said I'm being comforted in
[2:02:05] my trouble so that I can learn how to
[2:02:06] comfort somebody else in their trouble
[2:02:09] with the comfort that I
[2:02:13] received then he goes on to make another
[2:02:16] statement in verse five for as the
[2:02:19] sufferings of Christ abound in US so our
[2:02:22] consolation also abound by Christ and
[2:02:25] whether we be afflicted it is your for
[2:02:28] your consolation and salvation which is
[2:02:30] effectual in the enduring of the same
[2:02:32] sufferings which we also suffer what's
[2:02:35] he saying he said we're suffering we're
[2:02:39] suffering he says and whether we be
[2:02:42] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[2:02:45] salvation by saying I'm being Afflicted
[2:02:48] so that when you're Afflicted you can
[2:02:49] see that I was afflicted and you can be
[2:02:51] sold because you got the same thing I
[2:02:54] got that's what he's saying's breaking
[2:02:56] it down in plain English he's saying and
[2:02:59] we're afflicted for your consolation and
[2:03:01] salvation amen because you'll be
[2:03:03] suffering the same thing so you've got
[2:03:05] an example to look to and say hey he
[2:03:07] endured allander amen I'm comforted
[2:03:09] because this is nothing out of kilter
[2:03:11] with
[2:03:13] God is that how the is that what God did
[2:03:16] in the prophet for us he comforted him
[2:03:18] so he comforted us with the same comfort
[2:03:20] that he was comforted with but he also
[2:03:22] was afflicted amen for our comfort and
[2:03:24] salvation who will be afflicted with the
[2:03:26] same thing because we can look to him as
[2:03:27] an example and we can be comforted
[2:03:29] because if God will allow it in Paul God
[2:03:31] can allow it in me there's nothing wrong
[2:03:33] with Paul there's nothing wrong with me
[2:03:36] am amen all right we believe it in Paul
[2:03:39] and we believe it in brother brandham
[2:03:42] now do you believe it in
[2:03:44] yourself can God be doing things in our
[2:03:46] life just so somebody else can be
[2:03:49] comforted with our comfort amen or can
[2:03:52] God allow an Affliction in our life just
[2:03:53] so somebody else can be comforted at
[2:03:55] their time of
[2:03:57] Affliction when they say I saw you go
[2:03:59] through that and you held fast and God
[2:04:02] comforted you and it gives me courage to
[2:04:04] press on now
[2:04:06] am why does God let enemies remain in
[2:04:10] the
[2:04:11] land for
[2:04:13] us for our benefit yes are some of those
[2:04:17] enemies because of our mistakes yes they
[2:04:19] are is he using it for for our good yes
[2:04:23] he is don't ever give up friends don't
[2:04:27] ever lose heart don't ever forget who
[2:04:29] you are don't ever forget
[2:04:32] that the house of mourning is better
[2:04:36] than the house of Mirth am God loves me
[2:04:39] he's molding me and it may not be just
[2:04:42] for me it may be for me but it may be
[2:04:43] for someone else too it may be that God
[2:04:46] brings you through something just like
[2:04:49] he did Brother bham with his daughter so
[2:04:51] that that compassion and Love and Desire
[2:04:54] amen would would move to hundreds and
[2:04:56] thousands of other people and they would
[2:04:57] be blessed and delivered because of that
[2:05:01] maybe our testimony will set somebody
[2:05:03] else free amen maybe when we share what
[2:05:05] we've been through and what God's done
[2:05:06] for us it'll give somebody else courage
[2:05:08] to keep going and they'll keep going in
[2:05:10] the word and they'll be free let's not
[2:05:13] be narrow sided amen but let's look at
[2:05:15] the whole word and what brother the
[2:05:16] prophet taught us amen do things afflict
[2:05:18] us yes do enemies remain yes amen do
[2:05:21] they remain for a purpose yes Y and will
[2:05:25] they always remain I don't believe so I
[2:05:28] believe they'll go I have to believe
[2:05:30] they'll go I have to believe that the
[2:05:32] word will work I have to believe that
[2:05:34] this fight will finish this time it will
[2:05:36] finish if it comes again we'll fight
[2:05:39] again we have to
[2:05:41] believe until we press and press and
[2:05:43] press until finally The Last Enemy is
[2:05:47] defeated which is death
[2:05:52] amen we're all fighting against it we're
[2:05:54] all fighting against it and every day we
[2:05:56] get older we're fighting more and more
[2:05:57] this thing called death but The Last
[2:05:59] Enemy to be defeated is death and if it
[2:06:02] takes out a thousand more before we
[2:06:05] defeat it it doesn't matter we're going
[2:06:06] to defeat death Somebody by the grace of
[2:06:10] God and the power of almighty God is
[2:06:11] going to defeat death and take a body
[2:06:13] change and I believe it's going to be me
[2:06:16] if it's not me I'm going to believe it's
[2:06:17] me until the moment I'm I find myself in
[2:06:19] the sixth Dimension I'll be like well I
[2:06:21] guess it's not me anymore it'll be the
[2:06:23] next
[2:06:25] one keep pressing friends these things
[2:06:28] have to be this way don't let it
[2:06:30] discourage you just get back up and say
[2:06:33] praise God God's doing something amen
[2:06:35] God have glory in this work this too to
[2:06:38] your glory I don't know what you're
[2:06:39] doing I don't know how you're doing it
[2:06:41] amen the only thing I can do is what the
[2:06:42] prophet did when he was a young Minister
[2:06:44] I can just slip my hand in yours and
[2:06:46] trust you you know where I'm going and
[2:06:48] you know what you're trying to
[2:06:49] accomplish

[2:06:58] friends I am so thankful that God gave
[2:07:01] us this message so that our lives
[2:07:02] wouldn't be a big bundle of
[2:07:04] confusion why do we have all the word
[2:07:07] and we have all the power and the powers
[2:07:09] restored to the church and why am I
[2:07:10] still struggling with this amen you're
[2:07:12] still struggling with that because God
[2:07:13] has permitted it to mold you in a
[2:07:15] certain way and accomplish something for
[2:07:17] his
[2:07:18] kingdom and when he's done with it it'll
[2:07:20] be over
[2:07:22] just keep believing it'll be over

[2:08:48] the good and the bad and everything
[2:08:49] mixed in between just like you did for
[2:08:51] the the prophet with the successes and

[2:09:21] us and may Lord you make every wrong
[2:09:23] right and may we be willing to
[2:09:26] testify may we be willing to own up to
[2:09:28] our failures and and confess them Lord

[2:09:35] people may we go forward encourage Lord
[2:09:37] that no matter what happens something

[2:09:43] man of God in this generation Afflicted
[2:09:45] we saw him we saw him uh we saw him hurt
[2:09:48] we saw him wounded we saw him as a child
[2:09:51] afflicted by poverty by rejection by
[2:09:54] alcoholism by all the
[2:09:56] things we saw him make his mistakes and
[2:09:58] suffer for his own mistakes we saw his
[2:10:00] family suffer for his
[2:10:02] mistakes we saw what others had done to
[2:10:04] him we saw what he did
[2:10:06] himself and in the end of it all we can
[2:10:08] say you were perfect in everything you
[2:10:10] did in every way it was perfect and it
[2:10:13] all worked together for good and I'm the
[2:10:15] recipient of that
[2:10:16] good God if you did it for one man you
[2:10:19] can do it for another you can do it for
[2:10:21] for me because I'm your child as well
[2:10:23] Lord and you can make all my wrongs
[2:10:25] right and you can make every Affliction
[2:10:27] and every sorrow turn to
[2:10:29] good and you can use it to comfort
[2:10:31] others you can use it to encourage
[2:10:33] others God help us to have faith like
[2:10:37] shamgar help us Lord to keep pressing to

[2:10:48] to keep pressing against the enemies

[2:10:53] let them stay too long that's true but I
[2:10:56] pray God you give us the courage to keep
