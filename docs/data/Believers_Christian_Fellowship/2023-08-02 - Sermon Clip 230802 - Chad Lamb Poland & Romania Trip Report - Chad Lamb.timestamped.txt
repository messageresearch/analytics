[0:00] I've read that before
[0:03] but when you really stop and read what
[0:06] Paul's writing it's remarkable
[0:09] he says you received me as an angel of
[0:11] God well I can take that an angel's a
[0:14] messenger and received you as a met you
[0:16] received me as an angel of God okay yeah
[0:18] that makes sense I can go along with
[0:20] that intellectually as a human being
[0:24] but the next statement is going to take
[0:25] a revelation from God not intellectual
[0:28] understanding
[0:29] you receive me as an angel of God even
[0:31] as Christ Jesus
[0:37] they received the Apostle Paul in his
[0:39] ministry as Christ Jesus
[0:47] you were talking about walking a Razor's
[0:49] Edge now we're getting down to the
[0:50] razor's Edge and only the only the elect
[0:52] could walk this by faith
[0:55] because if you make Paul Jesus Christ
[0:58] and the person you've made him
[0:59] Antichrist
[1:02] but if you make you if you make what's
[1:05] working through him in the ministry
[1:06] coming through anything different than
[1:08] Jesus Christ you're wrong
[1:10] amen so when brother Branham was here
[1:13] amen somebody asked a question of
[1:15] questions answered could you be Jesus
[1:16] Christ or could Jesus Christ look like
[1:18] you or they were kind of him hauling
[1:20] around with the question and brother
[1:21] Benham says now now in one way that's
[1:23] right and in one way that's wrong
[1:25] said to make me the person of Jesus
[1:27] Christ would we make me Antichrist
[1:30] but to say that Christ was in me or
[1:32] using me or something like that now that
[1:34] would be exactly right
[1:36] so now when they receive the Apostle
[1:38] Paul the Apostle Paul was not the the
[1:42] full embodiment of Jesus Christ
[1:45] but who was ministering through Paul who
[1:48] was bringing the word who was that amen
[1:51] remember brother Branham said the
[1:53] fivefold ministry is the dress where the
[1:55] inner dress wear the under close
[2:00] of of Jesus Christ
[2:02] so
[2:03] what is inside the underclose
[2:08] Jesus Christ
[2:10] who's the veil hiding and remember it's
[2:13] the five-fold ministry that was the
[2:14] undergarment amen the underneath closes
[2:17] what brother Branham tells us the
[2:18] underneath close so what does that make
[2:20] the fifo ministry the very closest thing
[2:23] on earth to Jesus Christ
[2:26] because they're touching his skin the
[2:29] underneath clothes
[2:31] so
[2:32] how should we approach the preaching of
[2:35] the word
[2:36] how should we approach our brothers and
[2:38] sisters how should we approach the
[2:39] fellowship
[2:42] well I can take him as an angel of the
[2:44] Lord because angel means messenger
[2:48] can we go by Revelation a step beyond
[2:50] that
[2:53] well I can believe that for Paul because
[2:55] it was written in the Bible
[2:58] see that's all the intellectual side
[3:01] but by Revelation can we go above that
[3:03] and unlock the full potential of obeying
[3:06] the Lord the full potential of the
[3:08] Simplicity of coming to church but
[3:10] coming with the right frame of mind I
[3:11] have not come to hear a man preach I
[3:13] have come to hear Christ Jesus speak
[3:15] through a vessel he chose and placed a
[3:17] gift in before the foundation of the
[3:19] world and I'm trusting that God will
[3:21] operate by the Holy Ghost through that
[3:22] vest
