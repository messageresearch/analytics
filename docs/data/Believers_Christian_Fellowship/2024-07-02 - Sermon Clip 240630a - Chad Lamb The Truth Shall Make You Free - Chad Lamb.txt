========================================

do you remember if if you remember watching the video brother Brenham said go home in peace God bless you you're all right God bless you and she starts walking around him this way and as she starts going around when he says this part you're not a witch he leans over to her and says you're not a witch if you listen to the tape you've got to catch it close you're not a witch do you know what that did for that woman when a prophet of God who could hear from God would look right at her and expose the lie that was in her life and say they lied about you that's not the truth amen he says don't pay no attention to them people they're lying and furthermore that lie is causing all kinds of other problems in your life you're all nervous and worked up and think you got a heart condition you don't even have a heart condition you're all stirred up because of the lie why because the LIE brings death he says they're lying and the only thing that's wrong with your heart is that nervous condition got your heart work up go on home in peace God bless you you're all right God bless you you're not a witch I guarantee that woman walked off that platform a whole lot different than she walked up on it and I wonder how long it took for that nervous condition to go away and her heart problems to fade away they were the product of a lie she was believing a lie she was struggling she may not have fully embraced it but she was struggling with the LIE Hey listen I'm telling you here today I don't want to to struggle with this lie anymore but I want to believe the truth of this message that I have been accepted in the Beloved that God has revealed himself to me and he's revealed me to me and I Know Who I Am by the grace of God because he has called me to his side by opening the word to me that's the truth that dispels all the lies we can't go back and erase what was done in our past friends you can't go back listen many of us can't go back and we can't ask our moms and dads to take back what they said they're gone some of them are gone my dad is gone there's things that I cannot I cannot ask him to make it right I cannot ask him to make it up other people who have done wrong and furthermore the things that I've done to wrong people I can't even make all those things right amen but God help us to receive the truth that'll push back the lie and that I will come to a position of security in Christ not in what's been told not in all that's gone wrong not in all the circumstances but I can come to a position of security and say God I don't understand why you would choose me I don't understand how you made that choice but I believe in my heart that I'm part of you that when this word is preached something in me knows I belong with it there's a magnetism on the inside amen I look at all the facts around me all the facts around me confirm the LIE amen but there's a fact inside of me that confirms the truth and the truth is I do believe that this is true amen
