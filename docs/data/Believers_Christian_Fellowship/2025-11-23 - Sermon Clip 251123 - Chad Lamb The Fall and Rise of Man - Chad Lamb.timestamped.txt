[0:00] And every creature which is in heaven,
[0:02] and on the earth, and under the earth,
[0:05] and such as are in the sea, and all that
[0:06] are in them, heard I saying, "Blessing,
[0:09] and honor, and glory, and power be unto
[0:12] him that siteth upon the throne, and
[0:14] unto the Lamb forever and ever."
[0:17] &gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT? THIS IS THE WEEPING ONE.
[0:20] BEFORE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER,
[0:21] he's weeping BECAUSE ALL IS LOST. BUT
[0:24] NOW, THERE WAS A MAN that could come
[0:26] forth AND TAKE THE BOOK. AND WHEN HE
[0:28] TOOK THE BOOK, ALL HEAVEN ERUPTED IN
[0:30] PRAISE. And when heaven ERUPTED IN
[0:31] PRAISE, AS SOON AS THERE WAS A PAUSE, WE
[0:34] HEAR JOHN, WHICH IS A TYPE OF THE BRIDE.
[0:36] HE SAID, "EVERYTHING THAT EVER WAS in
[0:39] heaven, ON EARTH, UNDER THE EARTH, IN
[0:40] THE SEA, AND ALL THAT THERE IS HEARD ME
[0:43] LISTEN, THAT MUST BE SOME SORT OF
[0:44] PRAISING THAT HE WAS DOING, SAYING,
[0:46] "BLESSING." AMEN. He He said, "Oh,
[0:50] praise God." I want to read it the way
[0:51] HE SAID IT. HE SAID, UH, BLESSING AND
[0:54] HONOR AND GLORY AND POWER BE UNTO HIM
[0:56] THAT SITETH UPON THE throne and unto the
[0:58] lamb FOREVER AND EVER. OH, PRAISE GOD.
[1:02] HE TOOK THE BOOK.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. THIS IS REDEMPTION. PRAISE
[1:07] GOD. WHAT ADAM LOST HAS COME BACK INTO
[1:10] THE HANDS OF MAN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A
[1:12] MAN WHO PAID THE PRICE. THERE WAS A MAN
[1:14] WHO SAT THROUGH INTERCESSION THROUGH
[1:15] SEVEN CHURCH AGE TO MAKE SURE HIS BRIDE
[1:17] WAS SECURE. BUT AT THE END TIME, HE CAME
[1:19] FORTH TO TAKE HIS POSSESSION, HIS
[1:21] INHERITANCE, HIS RIGHTS. AND HE'S COME
[1:23] DOWN TO UNITE WITH HIS BRIDE. PRAISE
[1:26] GOD. HE TOOK THE BOOK.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; WHO? The man. Christ Jesus.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Our headship, our king, our Lord, our
[1:36] brother.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; He took the book.
[1:41] That's what this message is all about.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; People get caught up in he said this
[1:49] here and this here and the rules about
[1:51] this and can I do this and LISTEN THAT'S
[1:53] THAT'S NOT WHY THE MESSENGER CAME.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY HE CAME
[1:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WERE LOCKED DOWN IN
[2:00] DENOMINATIONALISM. WE WERE BLINDED AND
[2:02] DARKENED AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE
[2:04] CAME FROM, WHERE WE WERE GOING, WHAT IT
[2:06] WAS ALL ABOUT. AND THE MESSENGER CAME TO
[2:08] TAKE GOD THROUGH THAT MESSENGER TOOK THE
[2:10] VEIL OFF THE BIBLE. SO WE WOULD
[2:12] UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM, WHY WE'RE
[2:15] FALLEN, WHAT WE LOST, HOW IT GETS
[2:17] REDEEMED, WHO REDEEMED IT. AND SO THAT
[2:19] WE COULD REALIZE WE LIVE IN THE DAY it's
[2:21] redeemed. IT'S REDEEMED. IT'S REDEEMED.
[2:24] WHICH MEANS I'M REDEEMED. I'M REDEEMED.
[2:27] I'M REDEEMED.
[2:29] AND NOT ONLY THAT, HE CAME DOWN THE
[2:31] MIGHTY ANGEL. HE came down WITH AN OPEN
[2:33] BOOK IN HIS HAND TO DO WHAT? HE CAME
[2:35] DOWN TO UNITE WITH WHAT HE REDEEMED. AND
[2:38] THE FIRST PART OF THAT UNITING TAKES
[2:40] PLACE WITH A BRIDE, A PEOPLE THAT'S ON
[2:42] THE EARTH AT THE TIME OF THIS COMING.
[2:44] AND HE UNITES with them first.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; And this IS UNITING TIME AND SIGNS.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; This is what the message is about.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Everything else feeds into this. This is
[3:01] the purpose.
