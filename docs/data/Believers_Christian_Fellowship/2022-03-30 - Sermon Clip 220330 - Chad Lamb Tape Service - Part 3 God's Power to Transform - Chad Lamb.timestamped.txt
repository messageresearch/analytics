[0:00] so we know that what trans what does the
[0:02] transforming work it's the spirit of god
[0:04] where is the transforming power what is
[0:06] the transforming power of the word of
[0:08] god because the words i speak unto you
[0:10] they are spirit and life so when brother
[0:12] branham begins to talk about this
[0:14] transforming power amen he sometimes
[0:16] says the transforming power is the
[0:18] spirit sometimes he says the
[0:19] transforming power is the word he never
[0:22] separates the spirit from the word
[0:25] so it's not like somebody had
[0:27] transforming power transform their life
[0:29] with no word involved
[0:32] so the spirit of god that comes to give
[0:35] us a new birth and transform us it is
[0:38] not coming independently of the word
[0:41] it's receiving the word when you receive
[0:42] the word the spirit of the word comes
[0:44] into you and transforms you
[0:48] what happened to paul
[0:50] it says he heard a message
[0:54] and it transformed him
[0:56] from a church member and a church go to
[0:58] a prophet of god
[1:00] see if we want to be transformed in this
[1:02] hour if we want the the new birth if we
[1:04] want to transforming from the spirit of
[1:06] god we must receive the word that god
[1:08] has given us for this hour because this
[1:10] word will transform us
[1:13] so that's why we cannot preach
[1:17] a transforming experience
[1:19] separate from the word of god for this
[1:21] hour
[1:22] if we want to bring people to a
[1:24] transforming experience we must bring
[1:26] them the word and then you must take
[1:27] that word into your heart receive christ
[1:30] receive the word become one with it and
[1:32] the transforming power of the spirit
[1:34] will transform you
[1:37] that's the
[1:38] message so brother branham does not
[1:41] separate the two when he's describing
[1:43] the transformation what does the
[1:45] transformation what does the
[1:46] transforming what is the transforming
[1:48] power it's the spirit what was he
[1:50] transformed by what what quickened jesus
[1:53] the word of god
[1:54] but we know it was the spirit of god
[1:57] but why was it the spirit of god because
[1:59] it was the word of god
[2:01] i'll not leave thy soul in hell and i'll
[2:02] not suffer my holy one to see corruption
[2:04] so the word of god and the spirit of god
[2:06] worked together they're the same thing
