========================================
the blood is speaking and what's it doing it's calling seeds to life if there's a seed out there come to life if not if it's rejected god will take care of the rejection judgment will come but the blood is speaking amen it's speaking life it's speaking light it's creating an opportunity amen when you walk down the street when you walk through the store when you the way you conduct yourself at work and handle yourself as a family listen don't think of it in the negative thinking in the positive with sister when when you walk into that store every man there knows you're right i'm telling you he knows you're right it's inside of him and every woman knows you're right that's why she can't stand you it's the truth inside not on her mind but deep inside she knows you're right and that's why every woman in there doesn't like you and every man in there will respect you get out of the way open the door for you help you if something falls what are you doing you're calling out come on come on the life is here it's available it's real the word is still present the blood is still here there's a voice speaking come when when you sit down to that meal and bow your heads a family in harmony you're crying out to everybody in the restaurant come you're at work the way you operate the way you manage yourself the the honesty the integrity with which you have your christian walk on display you're calling to your co-workers come the life is calling out if there's any life come if there's any life come amen that's why compromise is so deadly it's so dark perverted word is such darkness and such death amen this isn't the hour to take our own minds but to come to the message and say god shape me to be exactly what this word says because i want a life that calls come i want to walk and a walk in this life that calls come come come come to the waters of life the contrast is becoming greater and i believe it will become greater yet and that's the that's the opportunity for the light to shine brighter because the bright the light shines brightest in the face of darkness and the darker it gets the brighter the light the contrast is a wonderful opportunity to cry come come come to the word come into the way that's right come back to the lord when you when you structure your family structure your life structure your home dress yourself conduct yourself speak like a christian speak like christ you're crying to everyone you come in contact with come come to the light come to the life
