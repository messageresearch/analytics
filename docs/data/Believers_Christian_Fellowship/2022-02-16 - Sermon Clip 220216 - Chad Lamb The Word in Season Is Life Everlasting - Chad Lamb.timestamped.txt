[0:00] the world is falling apart
[0:02] we talked about this sunday who wants to
[0:04] fly away and run away and go live
[0:06] off-grid somewhere in the mountains
[0:12] but
[0:13] you take life when you pull back into
[0:16] the mountains you pull life back into
[0:17] the mountains
[0:20] when you keep away from everybody keep
[0:23] your head down talk to nobody refute you
[0:25] pull life back from the world
[0:29] god did not tell his disciples i'll pray
[0:31] to get you out of the world but i'll
[0:32] pray that god will keep you from the
[0:34] evil in the world
[0:36] we have to be here to shine light amen
[0:39] she will be the final voice
[0:41] to the final age it's not trivial it's
[0:45] not light it's powerful it is life amen
[0:48] we're carrying life we're bearing life
[0:50] we're presenting life we're sharing life
[0:52] it's everlasting life it isn't the
[0:54] message as a form of church and a form
[0:56] of teaching in a form of adherence to
[0:58] codes that's not it friends it's you and
[1:01] christ as persons together sharing life
[1:04] demonstrating life being life
[1:08] man it's not it's not time to settle
[1:10] down into a church and and i'm in the
[1:13] message that term can mean anything it
[1:15] has become it has turned into anything
[1:17] anything you want to be the message has
[1:19] been the message
[1:20] and it's it's a loosely attached to
[1:23] brother branham in one way or another
[1:25] loosely or firmly however you do that if
[1:27] there's an attachment to the messenger
[1:29] saying we believe the message amen but i
[1:31] want to do more than believe the message
[1:33] because the devil believes the message
[1:38] i want to be the message amen
[1:41] i want to be the manifestation of the
[1:43] word for this day and i could only do it
[1:45] if he chose me before the foundation of
[1:47] the world amen if it's his choosing not
[1:49] mine i can't make myself that but if he
[1:51] made me before the foundation of the
[1:53] world then that's my place and i want to
[1:55] be that so how do you be that brother
[1:57] chad you yield yourself to this word and
[2:01] then stop resisting it stop explaining
[2:03] it away stop trying to form it into our
[2:05] own understanding or package it into the
[2:08] package we're most comfortable with but
[2:10] come back to the message and say if
[2:12] that's the way god presented it that's
[2:14] the way i believe it
[2:16] if that's the way the prophet taught it
[2:18] that's the way i believe it if that's
[2:20] the way god wanted me to receive his
[2:22] word and god instructed me then that is
[2:24] the way that i believe it and that's the
[2:26] way i receive it
