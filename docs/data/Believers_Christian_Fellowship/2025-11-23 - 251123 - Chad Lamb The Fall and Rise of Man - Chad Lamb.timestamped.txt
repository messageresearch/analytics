[0:00] Oh, in him, in him is the only place for
[0:05] me. I won't go back for anything to
[0:10] where I used to be. The sun is always
[0:15] shining and the victories been won. And
[0:19] I'm walking in the light of that new
[0:23] Jerusalem.
[0:26] Oh, I know that I am nothing to bear the
[0:31] Christian name. For every blunder that I
[0:35] make, I just myself to blame. But glory
[0:40] hallelujah,
[0:41] I don't see them at all. And neither
[0:45] does my savior, for the blood has
[0:48] cleansed them all. In him, in him, he's
[0:53] the only place for me. I won't go back
[0:58] for anything. Where I used to be. The
[1:02] sun is always shining. And the victory's
[1:06] been won. And I'm walking in the light
[1:10] of that new Jerusalem.
[1:13] [Music]
[1:14] Why do you talk of sorrow? For there is
[1:19] none in here. In Christ is no
[1:22] unhappiness. In Christ there is no fear.
[1:26] It doesn't seem to matter how dark it is
[1:30] outside. For in his sh a kind of glory.
[1:35] A soul is free to hide. In him in him is
[1:41] the only place for me. I won't go back
[1:45] for anything to where I used to be. The
[1:49] sun is always shining and the victory's
[1:53] been won. And I'm walking in the light
[1:57] of that new Jerusalem.
[2:01] It doesn't seem to matter how this whole
[2:05] flesh may feel. Let every man's word be
[2:09] a lie. God's word alone is real. Oh, how
[2:13] my heart's rejoicing is all in him, not
[2:17] me. And the glory is to him alone
[2:21] throughout eternity.
[2:24] In him, in him is the only place for me.
[2:30] I won't go back for anything to where I
[2:33] used to be. The sun is always shining
[2:38] and the victory's been won. And I'm
[2:41] walking in the light of that new
[2:44] Jerusalem.
[2:47] Oh, it doesn't seem to matter how this
[2:51] old flesh may feel. Let every man's word
[2:55] be a lie. God's word alone is real. Oh,
[2:59] how my heart's rejoicing is all in him,
[3:03] not me. And the glory is to him alone
[3:07] throughout eternity.
[3:10] In him, in him is the only place for me.
[3:16] I won't go back for anything to where I
[3:19] used to be. The sun is always shining
[3:24] and the victory's been won. And I'm
[3:27] walking in the light of that new
[3:30] Jerusalem.
[3:33] Oh, I know that I am nothing to bear the
[3:37] Christian name. For every blunder that I
[3:41] make, I'm just myself to blame. But
[3:45] glory, hallelujah,
[3:48] I don't see them at all. And neither
[3:51] does my savior. For the blood has
[3:54] cleansed them all. In him, in him is the
[3:59] only place for me. I won't go back for
[4:03] anything where I used to be. The sun is
[4:08] always shining and the victory's been
[4:11] won. And I'm walking in the light of
[4:15] that new Jerusalem once more. In him, in
[4:20] him is the only place for me. I won't go
[4:24] back for anything to where I used to be.
[4:29] The sun is always shining and the
[4:32] victories been won and I'm walking in
[4:36] the light of that new Jerusalem.
[4:39] [Music]

[8:06] their strength.
[8:08] They shall mount up with wings as
[8:14] an eagle.
[8:19] They shall walk and not be weery.

[8:38] [Music]
[8:44] For so long
[8:46] I search for life's meaning.
[8:50] [Music]
[8:52] enslaved by this world and my greed.
[8:59] [Music]
[9:01] Then the door of my prison was open.
[9:07] My love for the ransom
[9:11] was paid. I was free. Can you say amen?
[9:17] And I'm free from the fear of tomorrow.
[9:23] [Music]
[9:25] Yes, I'm free from the guilt of my past.
[9:31] [Music]
[9:33] For I've traded
[9:35] my shackles for a glorious
[9:40] song. I'm free. Praise the Lord. Free at
[9:46] last.
[9:49] Yes, I'm free from the guilt that I
[9:54] carried
[9:56] and from the dull empty life, I'm set
[10:01] free.
[10:03] [Music]
[10:04] For when I met
[10:07] Jesus, he made me complete. He forgot
[10:14] the foolish man. I used to be. Thank
[10:18] you, Jesus.
[10:20] Yes, I'm free from the fear of tomorrow.
[10:28] And I'm free from the guilt of my past.
[10:36] For I've traded
[10:38] these shackles for a glorious
[10:42] song. I'm free. Praise the Lord free at
[10:47] last.
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] Yes, I'm free from the fear of tomorrow.
[10:58] And I'm free from the guilt of my past.
[11:06] For I've traded the shackles for a
[11:10] glorious
[11:12] song. I'm free. Praise the Lord. Free at
[11:18] last.
[11:21] For I've traded
[11:23] my shackles for a glorious
[11:27] song. I'm free. Praise the Lord. Free at
[11:33] last.
[11:34] [Music]
[11:36] For I've traded my shackles for a
[11:40] glorious
[11:42] song. Yes, I'm free. Praise the Lord.
[11:46] Free at last.
[11:50] Yes, I'm free. Praise the Lord. Free at
[11:54] last.
[11:58] Thank you, Jesus.
[12:04] When peace
[12:07] like a river
[12:12] attendeth
[12:15] my way.
[12:18] When sorrows
[12:22] like
[12:24] billows
[12:26] roll.
[12:29] [Music]
[12:32] Whatever
[12:34] [Music]
[12:36] my love,
[12:38] thou hast taught
[12:42] me to say.
[12:45] It is well.
[12:49] It is well
[12:52] with my soul.
[12:56] [Music]
[12:56] [Laughter]
[13:00] It is well
[13:07] with my soul.
[13:12] [Music]
[13:14] It is well.
[13:17] It is well
[13:21] with my soul.
[13:25] [Music]
[13:28] And those satan
[13:32] should come.
[13:36] No trials
[13:39] should come.
[13:43] Let his
[13:46] bless assure
[13:49] us
[13:51] control
[13:55] [Music]
[13:57] that Christ
[14:00] had regarded
[14:04] my
[14:07] estee.
[14:10] and has shed
[14:13] his own love
[14:17] for my soul.
[14:24] Oh, it is well
[14:31] with my soul.
[14:34] [Music]
[14:38] It is well.
[14:42] It is well

[22:26] [Music]
[22:29] come
[22:32] and drink
[22:35] your
[22:39] Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[22:42] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, God,
[22:45] that you have drawn us together once
[22:47] again. And God, it's a great privilege
[22:50] that we all stand here this morning. For
[22:53] God, no man can come to you unless your
[22:55] father has drawn them. And oh God, we're
[22:57] so thankful that you've drawn us with
[22:59] your drawing power, with your great
[23:01] love. And God, you've brought us here to
[23:04] this service this morning.
[23:06] And God, as we worship you, Lord, we
[23:08] give you glory and honor. We magnify
[23:11] your name for God, you are so worthy.
[23:15] And God, as we look into you, God, we
[23:17] ask that you would come and unveil
[23:18] yourself to us once again. Give us the
[23:21] eyes that we might see and the ears that
[23:24] we might hear. Lord, all that you want
[23:26] to share with us this morning.
[23:28] May you use this vessel of mine for your
[23:31] glory and honor. May you speak eternal
[23:34] words to these lips of clay. God, may we
[23:37] receive your word and may it bring life
[23:39] to us, Lord. May it bring life that
[23:42] becomes a manifestation in this world, a
[23:44] light in darkness that you might be
[23:47] displayed through us. God, we come for
[23:50] this purpose. We come to worship you. We
[23:52] come to feed from you. We come to
[23:53] receive of you. And Lord, that we might
[23:56] be strengthened to go and be what you've
[23:58] called us to be in this life. We ask now
[24:01] that you would take preeminence among us
[24:03] as you take the bread in your hand and
[24:06] break it before us. May our eyes be open
[24:08] and may we behold you, Lord, and see
[24:10] you. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[24:14] Amen.
[24:16] Amen. God bless you. While you're
[24:17] standing, if you would just turn with me
[24:19] to the book of Luke.
[24:21] Just want to mention that yesterday we
[24:23] had Sister Nancy Marorrow's memorial
[24:24] service here and and it went really
[24:27] well. And we appreciate everybody who
[24:28] came, all who were able to attend.
[24:31] Special thank you to all who helped with
[24:32] the service, the musicians and the song
[24:34] leader and the deacons who helped out
[24:36] and everybody who helped with the dinner
[24:38] and helped Sister Mana. It was
[24:39] wonderful. It was a wonderful day and a
[24:41] wonderful time. So, thank you all for
[24:43] that. And just remember the family as
[24:45] they grieve. But we're not grieving for
[24:48] Sister Nancy. We're so happy for her.
[24:51] Amen. So thankful. So I want also want
[24:54] to let you know that next Sunday I'll be
[24:56] gone. and I'll be down in Junction City
[24:58] just south of Columbus there with the
[25:00] group from Junction City. I'll be
[25:02] preaching for them. They're starting to
[25:04] get their church established. They have
[25:05] one of the brothers there who's rose up
[25:06] and began preaching amongst them and
[25:09] they've put him in as an interim pastor
[25:11] and they're exploring uh having him as
[25:13] pastor. And so they we've been in
[25:14] discussion and asked me to come down and
[25:16] minister and maybe maybe talk about how
[25:18] to move forward and those things. So
[25:20] just be praying for that group. They're
[25:22] moving forward. Amen. And it's exciting
[25:24] to see what God's doing for them. So,
[25:26] while I'm there, Brother Gabe Smith will
[25:27] be preaching here. So, remember to keep
[25:29] him in prayer as well. Amen. For the
[25:31] service. Also wanted to say that Bible
[25:34] Believers Christian School had their
[25:35] play Friday night. I know many were
[25:36] there and enjoyed that. I wasn't there,
[25:38] but me and my wife streamed from home.
[25:40] Amen. We found a link somewhere, so we
[25:42] snuck in. Amen. And they did a wonderful
[25:44] job. We saw all of you kids there. You
[25:46] guys did a great job. And uh Sister Vidy
[25:49] wrote the play if I'm not mistaken. And
[25:50] she did an excellent job, too. So, it
[25:53] was it was a lot of fun and we enjoyed
[25:54] seeing it. So God bless all of you.
[25:57] Amen. And so let's take a look now at
[25:59] Luke. Luke 3 verse 38. Luke chapter 3
[26:05] verse 38. Also want to appreciate
[26:07] brother Jose for sharing the special.
[26:09] God bless you my brother. Amen. We
[26:11] appreciated that. Amen. So many times I
[26:13] forget to mention things like that and
[26:15] I'm so sorry that I do. When I come
[26:17] around back I got my mind focused on one
[26:19] thing and it's hard. I'm a onetrack mind
[26:22] kind of person anyway. So, it's very
[26:23] hard for me to break out of the one
[26:25] track. Amen. I go down a one-way street
[26:27] with big guardrails and high walls. So,
[26:29] please forgive me. But I always
[26:31] appreciate the contribution of the
[26:32] saints. It always adds to the service.
[26:34] And we always appreciate it so much. So,
[26:36] thank you. Amen. In verse 38, it says,
[26:41] "Which was the son of Enos, which was
[26:42] the son of Seth, which was the son of
[26:44] Adam, which was the son of God." Amen.
[26:48] God bless you as you have your seats.
[26:50] Amen. I opened with that scripture one
[26:53] time before and we're kind of jumping
[26:55] right in the middle of the thought as
[26:56] they're going through the lineage there
[26:57] of Christ. But but wanted to note that
[27:00] that Adam was the son of God. So if we
[27:03] could bring the PowerPoint up now, I'd
[27:06] like to minister on the fall and rise of
[27:08] man. We know the story of the gospel so
[27:11] well. We know what happened to man in
[27:13] the beginning and how God had
[27:15] established his son upon the earth and
[27:17] given him dominion. And we're going to
[27:19] go through some scriptures. I'm so
[27:20] thankful for the PowerPoint today
[27:22] because there's a lot of scriptures I
[27:23] want to read, but we're going to be able
[27:25] to move quickly through them. So, if you
[27:27] have your pen and paper handy and you
[27:28] want to jot them down, jot them fast cuz
[27:30] I'm going to keep moving. Amen. Uh, this
[27:33] is Genesis 1. We know really well. Says,
[27:36] "So God created man in his own image, in
[27:38] the image of God created he him. Male
[27:40] and female created he them. And God
[27:43] blessed them. And God said unto them,
[27:44] "Be fruitful, and multiply, and
[27:47] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[27:50] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[27:51] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[27:53] every living thing that moveth upon the
[27:55] earth." This was man's commission. When
[27:58] God commissioned man upon the earth, he
[28:00] commissioned him to take dominion.
[28:02] Brother M said, to be God on the earth.
[28:04] He was an amateur God, a son of God, and
[28:07] he was given rulership over the
[28:09] creation. And God would take this man
[28:11] that he had created in his image and he
[28:12] would put him down into flesh to
[28:14] interact with the creation that he was
[28:17] given charge over, given dominion of and
[28:19] given rulership over. And so man was
[28:22] moved in the flesh. And we know, amen,
[28:24] that from him would come his help meet.
[28:26] They'd be united together and there
[28:28] would be a commandment for them to
[28:29] replenish the earth and subdue and bring
[28:31] everything subject and in order. Amen.
[28:34] And then God planted a garden and and
[28:36] the Lord God took the man and put him
[28:39] into the garden of Eden to dress it and
[28:42] to keep it. Amen. God put him there to
[28:44] work in the garden. Amen. To be the
[28:46] ruler to to set it in order and to guard
[28:49] it, to protect it and to order it. Amen.
[28:52] That was his job. Amen. As God upon the
[28:54] earth. But we know that he fell. Brother
[28:58] Bam says this. When Adam was in the
[29:00] Garden of Eden, when he come to the
[29:03] responsibility to make his choice, would
[29:05] he stay with God or go with his wife, he
[29:08] had to make that the responsibility was
[29:10] up to him. He either had to take what
[29:12] his wife said or what God said. And when
[29:14] he chose to go the way of his wife and
[29:16] when he did that then he lost his
[29:18] original condition and brought the whole
[29:21] world subject to death when he had to
[29:24] take the responsibility or either
[29:26] accepting a new light that his wife had
[29:29] found which was contrary. Oh God think
[29:32] of it. God only give them about eight or
[29:34] 10 words to keep but of the tree thou
[29:36] shalt not eat. That's all they had to
[29:38] keep. And even with that much word they
[29:40] broke it. Then Adam had to face up. Will
[29:44] I will I do as my wife has said do or
[29:46] shall I do what God said do? And he
[29:48] walked out with his eyes opened. He had
[29:50] to take the responsibility that throw
[29:53] the that throwed the whole human race
[29:56] unto death. Amen. That's why we're in
[29:59] the condition we're in now. That's why,
[30:01] Amen. that our bodies deteriorate with
[30:03] age. That's why we had a memorial
[30:05] service yesterday for Sister Nancy. All
[30:08] of that was because Adam made his choice
[30:10] to leave the word. Amen. And we know he
[30:13] did it as a type of Christ going, Amen,
[30:15] to redeem his wife. Amen. But
[30:17] nonetheless, he had to leave the word to
[30:19] do so. And in leaving the word, Amen, he
[30:21] throwed all of us into death.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the condition we all
[30:27] find ourselves in.
[30:29] And he says here in Genesis 3, "And unto
[30:32] Adam, he said, because thou hast
[30:34] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
[30:36] and has eaten of the tree of which I
[30:37] commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
[30:39] eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy
[30:41] sake, and sorrow shalt thou eat of it
[30:43] all the days of thy life. Thorns also,
[30:45] and thistle shalt it bring forth to
[30:47] thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the
[30:48] field, and the sweat of thy face shalt
[30:51] thou eat bread till thou return into the
[30:52] ground. For out of it was thou taken,
[30:55] for dust thou art, and to dust shalt
[30:58] thou return.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:02] You and I weren't there that day in the
[31:05] form we are now. Let's just say that.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; We weren't there. Amen. We we didn't
[31:10] make the decision that Adam made. And we
[31:13] know that brother Brandham put us all on
[31:14] the same basis. He said, "We're standing
[31:16] before those trees now. We make our
[31:17] choice." But just if you if you'll just
[31:20] uh let me explain it this way. Adam was
[31:22] placed there as the as the first man on
[31:25] earth. He was created of God and placed
[31:27] there and given dominion. Amen. And out
[31:29] of him would come his wife and the two
[31:31] united together was to bring forth the
[31:34] God race. Brother Bam said they would
[31:35] have eventually brought forth Jesus
[31:37] Christ. Amen.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Right. They were supposed to bring forth
[31:40] this seed upon the earth. Amen. And and
[31:43] and so Adam was placed there as the head
[31:46] of the family and as the head of the
[31:48] family when he left the word. Amen.
[31:50] Amen. And when he chose to go with his
[31:52] wife, Amen, he threw the entire family
[31:55] into death, into chaos, into ruin. Amen.
[31:58] Because God accounted him the first and
[32:00] God accounted him the head. And when the
[32:02] head fell, everything under him fell.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Mim says it this way in the
[32:07] breach. Now, of course, when Adam fell
[32:09] to death, he brought death upon all
[32:12] creation, not just man, upon all
[32:14] creation because he was placed as God,
[32:17] ruler over all creation. So everything
[32:20] was under Adam's headship. All the
[32:23] animals, the plant life, all of creation
[32:26] was under Adam's headship. And he was
[32:27] placed as a god to rule over it all. And
[32:30] when Adam fell, everything fell.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to look at a type of this
[32:36] in Joshua. Turn with me to Joshua
[32:39] chapter 7.
[32:41] Many of you know this story really well.
[32:43] We're going to just uh take a quick uh
[32:46] snapshot of the story of Achen.
[32:51] We know that when they went into the
[32:53] promised land and and when they uh
[32:58] crossed the border and went into the
[32:59] promised land, the first place they came
[33:01] against was Jericho. But God said, "The
[33:03] spoil of Jericho is mine. This first one
[33:05] that's destroyed is mine. Take nothing
[33:07] of it." A and but Achen did. And in
[33:10] chapter 7 verse one it says, "But the
[33:12] children of Israel committed a trespass
[33:14] in these thing. For Achen, the son of
[33:17] Kari, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zarah
[33:20] of the tribe of Judah, took of the
[33:22] oursed thing. And the anger of the Lord
[33:24] was kindled against the children of
[33:26] Israel." And we realize that that as
[33:29] they come out from under the blessing of
[33:31] God because they disobeyed the word of
[33:33] God, that 36 men lost their life in the
[33:36] attack of Ai, which was just a a little
[33:38] small city. They turned their backs and
[33:40] they ran away. Amen. And and they were
[33:42] killed. And so Joshua starts to set up a
[33:46] a a a he starts to mourn and he starts
[33:48] to cry out to God. And God says, "Why
[33:50] are you crying out to me? There's sin in
[33:51] the camp." So he starts going through
[33:53] and trying to find where it is. And they
[33:55] bring them order by order, tribe by
[33:57] tribe, family by family. Until finally
[33:59] they land on Achen. And so let's turn to
[34:02] chapter 19 and pick the story up there.
[34:06] And Joshua said unto Achen, "My son,
[34:09] give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord,
[34:12] God of Israel, and make confession unto
[34:14] him, and tell me now what thou hast
[34:17] done. Hide it not from me." And Anchen
[34:20] answered Joshua, and said, Indeed, I
[34:22] have sinned against the Lord God of
[34:24] Israel, and thus and thus have I done.
[34:27] When I saw among the spoils a goodly
[34:29] Babylonish garment and 200 shekels of
[34:32] silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels
[34:34] weight, then I coveted them and took
[34:37] them and behold they are hid in the
[34:39] earth in the midst of my tent and the
[34:41] silver under it. So Joshua sent
[34:44] messengers and they ran into the tent
[34:46] and behold it was hid in his tent and
[34:48] the silver under it. And they took them
[34:50] out of the midst of the tent and brought
[34:52] them unto Joshua and unto the children
[34:54] of Israel and laid them out before the
[34:56] Lord. And Joshua and all Israel with him
[34:59] took Achen the son of Zarah and the
[35:01] silver and the garment and the wedge of
[35:03] gold and his sons and his daughters and
[35:05] his oxen and his asses and his sheep and
[35:08] his tent and all that he had. And they
[35:12] brought them into the valley of Achor.
[35:14] And Joshua said, "Why hast thou troubled
[35:16] us? The Lord shall trouble thee this
[35:18] day." And all Israel stoned them with
[35:20] stones and burned them with fire after
[35:22] they had stoned them with stones. And
[35:24] they raised over him a great heap of
[35:26] stones unto this day. So the Lord turned
[35:29] from the fierceness of his anger.
[35:31] Wherefore the name of that place was
[35:32] called the valley of Acor unto this day.
[35:36] Amen. I wanted to read this story.
[35:38] There's many stories like this in the
[35:39] Bible, but I want to read this story
[35:41] because I want to show a picture of
[35:42] headship.
[35:44] This is how important headship is. Amen.
[35:47] And and it it's so important for all of
[35:49] us who are in headship as fathers or
[35:52] husbands or or whatever place that God's
[35:54] placed us in. There's headship in
[35:56] business. There's headship in schools.
[35:57] There's headship in churches. There
[35:59] headship in families. There's headship
[36:01] all over. But but but everything rises
[36:04] and falls with headship.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; When Adam fell, we all fell. And we're
[36:09] still suffering because of Adam's
[36:11] decision.
[36:13] And now uh Achen is here and he has got
[36:18] the word of the Lord. And the word of
[36:19] the Lord tells him the spoil of Jericho
[36:21] is his. But he's tempted and he lusted
[36:23] after something. And when he saw the
[36:25] goodly Babylonian garment and the silver
[36:27] and the wedge of gold, Amen. he took
[36:29] them and he went and he hid them in his
[36:31] tent. Amen. And and a as he hid them, he
[36:34] didn't realize. But he as the head of
[36:37] his family and the head of his
[36:39] household, Amen. when he got tempted and
[36:42] when he fell into this sin, he was
[36:44] destroying the lives of everything that
[36:47] was under his headship.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why it's so important when
[36:52] we become fathers, when we become
[36:53] husbands, amen, that we pay attention to
[36:55] what we're doing that we don't live
[36:57] frivolously because everything under our
[36:58] headship will be blessed or cursed by
[37:01] our headship.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important, Amen, to
[37:04] be established in the gospel. Amen. Be
[37:06] filled with the spirit. Have a personal
[37:08] walk with Jesus Christ. Be lined up to
[37:10] his word and subject to his word before
[37:12] you bring anybody else under your
[37:14] headship. No matter what headship that
[37:16] is.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they're depending on you.
[37:20] Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And so when when they come and they find
[37:24] out what uh Achen had done,
[37:28] he says
[37:30] in verse 24, let's go back to verse 24.
[37:34] And Joshua and all Israel with him took
[37:37] Achen the son of Zarah and the silver
[37:40] and the garment and the wedge of gold
[37:43] and his sons
[37:46] and his daughters
[37:48] and his oxen and his asses and his sheep
[37:53] and his tent and all that he had.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; That's headship.
[38:02] and all that he had.
[38:05] When Achen was cursed, everything under
[38:07] him was cursed.
[38:09] And they took it all and they judged it
[38:12] all.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, God, help us."
[38:16] &gt;&gt; This is a picture also of Eden again
[38:19] repeating itself because the themes of
[38:21] the Bible repeat all through the Bible.
[38:24] Every picture, every drama showing us,
[38:26] Amen, the picture of the fall of man and
[38:28] the redemption of man. And it's going
[38:30] from the beginning to the end of the
[38:31] Bible. And now we realize that
[38:33] everything now has to be judged and put
[38:35] outside of Israel because Israel cannot
[38:37] let this sin remain. They have to go in
[38:39] obedience for the blessing of God to
[38:41] remain amongst them and go on and take
[38:43] the land. Amen. So they judge Achen and
[38:45] they judge everything under Achen
[38:47] because everything under Achen was
[38:49] subject to Achen. And when Achen fell,
[38:51] his entire household fell, his sheep
[38:54] fell.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; What did the sheep do? Nothing. What did
[38:57] his oxen do? Nothing. What did his tent
[38:59] do? Nothing.
[39:01] What does his sons do? Nothing. What did
[39:03] his daughters do? They did nothing. But
[39:05] because they were under his leadership
[39:07] and headship, they fell when he fell.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Oh God, if there's anything that should
[39:13] make you tremble as a man, as a father,
[39:15] as a husband, as a leader in any
[39:17] position, this should make you tremble
[39:19] and say, "God, I need thee every hour,
[39:21] every moment of the day. I need your
[39:23] leadership in my life. I need your rod
[39:25] of correction to guide me. I need your
[39:27] staff to lead me, God, because the
[39:28] stakes are so high. Amen.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; And this is what happened in Eden to us.
[39:34] AMEN. WHEN ADAM FELL, EVERYTHING FELL.
[39:37] AMEN. The the animal LIFE FELL, THE
[39:39] BOTANY LIFE FELL, the order of the
[39:41] univer, the order of the earth fell, we
[39:44] fell. Amen. I wasn't there that day to
[39:47] make that decision. And and I'm not
[39:49] blaming Adam because I've made a whole
[39:50] pile of bad decisions myself. But I
[39:52] wasn't there that day, but what he did
[39:54] that day affects me this day because he
[39:57] was the head of the family.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:00] This is the law of God. And this is the
[40:02] way that it works, friends.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:07] But the gracious thing in the eyes of
[40:09] God is if it works for evil, it can work
[40:11] for good.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; We can be blessed by a good father, by a
[40:14] good husband. Amen. By by a good savior.
[40:17] Amen. We can be blessed under the right
[40:19] kind of headship. Amen. We fell when our
[40:22] head fell. That's why we need a transfer
[40:24] of headship. Amen. And if we can find a
[40:26] transfer of headship and we can get the
[40:28] headship that's blessed, we're blessed
[40:29] under headship. Amen.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; WE COME INTO THE WORLD CURSED. AMEN. As
[40:34] children that come AFTER ADAM, WE'RE
[40:36] CURSED. AMEN. But by the grace of God,
[40:39] he's provided a way for another headship
[40:41] to come into our lives.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; He says in the third seal, there was
[40:46] nothing lost until Adam. And after Adam,
[40:49] all was lost in the earth. I hope we can
[40:52] see this. The oxen, amen, the asses, the
[40:55] sheep, the everything was lost when Adam
[40:58] was lost.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; And everything on the creation of the
[41:01] earth was lost. And everything fell with
[41:03] Adam. Crossed the chasm that no one
[41:05] could get back. No way at all. Man, when
[41:08] he sinned, he left his way. He left no
[41:11] way back for himself. I mean, this is
[41:14] this is this is so important because of
[41:17] the nature of the fall. man was left
[41:19] with no bridge to cross BACK OVER THE
[41:21] CHASM because Adam, amen, Adam was a
[41:25] clean vessel. His wife was a clean
[41:27] vessel. And those two clean vessels,
[41:29] amen, could bring forth the word of God.
[41:31] But the woman went and polluted herself,
[41:34] amen, by hybridizing herself, amen, in
[41:36] adultery with serpent and receive
[41:38] serpent seed. Now corrupting the very
[41:41] womb, amen, that was perfect. And now,
[41:43] amen, there was no way, amen, to bring
[41:45] forth God's plan BECAUSE THE VERY FLESH
[41:48] OF Eve was corrupted. Amen. And when
[41:51] Adam made his decision to leave the
[41:52] word, even though Adam was pure, Adam
[41:55] went with his wife and corrupted himself
[41:58] with her. And now he in a fallen
[42:01] condition cannot pay the price of
[42:03] redemption because he needs redemption
[42:05] himself. And from then on now, amen,
[42:08] God's moving with a permissive will,
[42:10] allowing children to be born under the
[42:12] permissive will by sex birth. BUT
[42:14] EVERYONE COMES WRONG, HYBRID, COME TO
[42:17] THE WORLD the wrong way. And there's no
[42:20] WAY BACK. WE CANNOT CROSS BACK OVER THAT
[42:22] CHASM BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN EDEN.
[42:25] What happened with serpent seed?
[42:27] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY SERPENT SEED IS SUCH A VITAL
[42:29] THING TO BE RESTORED IN THE LAST DAY
[42:31] BECAUSE it gives US THE UNDERSTANDING OF
[42:33] EVERYTHING. the basis of the fall, the
[42:36] the reason for redemption and the method
[42:38] of redemption is all based on the
[42:40] understanding of what happened in Eden
[42:43] &gt;&gt; and how Adam fell and why nothing
[42:47] &gt;&gt; nothing could redeem it back.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; So under headship, we were stuck
[42:54] &gt;&gt; out on a limb across the chasm with no
[42:56] way back. Yeah. Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Romans 7 says, "For we know that the law
[43:03] is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold
[43:07] under sin." This word sold means
[43:10] slavery.
[43:12] Sold as a slave. We've been sold into
[43:15] slavery by our father Adam.
[43:20] We come into the world bound in chains
[43:23] of slavery under sin because of the
[43:26] carnality in our lives.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Romans 8 says, "Because the carnal mind,
[43:32] excuse me, is enmity against God, for it
[43:35] is not subject to the law of God,
[43:36] neither indeed can be." This is the
[43:39] condition we come in with a carnal mind,
[43:42] sold into slavery, sold into sin. We
[43:46] come with the wrong spirit. We come with
[43:48] the with the wrong flesh. We come all
[43:50] mixed up into this world. Amen. And our
[43:53] mind, our carnal mind is enmity, an
[43:57] enemy, hateful against God, for it is
[44:00] not subject to the law of God. Neither
[44:02] indeed can it be.
[44:05] Oh, we're in bad shape. How many
[44:06] believes we're in bad shape?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we can get in good shape,
[44:10] we got to realize we're in bad shape.
[44:11] Amen. And that's for every one of those
[44:13] children that's born here to godly
[44:15] parents and raised in the church and
[44:16] raised in the atmosphere of the Holy
[44:18] Ghost. Amen. Before you can ever find
[44:20] your way up, you've got to realize
[44:22] you're pretty low. Amen. It doesn't
[44:24] matter how you were raised and what you
[44:25] were protected from. And if you were
[44:27] born, Amen, to godly parents who believe
[44:29] the truth of God's word and lived
[44:30] consecrated, holy lives, amen, you're
[44:33] blessed under that kind of headship. But
[44:35] don't forget, YOU STILL COME from the
[44:36] lineage of Adam and your natural birth.
[44:38] and you're still doomed and you're
[44:40] across a chasm with no way back in and
[44:42] of yourself. And you're born with a
[44:44] carnal mind that's enmity against God.
[44:46] And it doesn't matter how much education
[44:48] you get. You've got to have something
[44:50] more than that. There's got to be
[44:52] SOMETHING THAT'LL CROSS YOU BACK OVER
[44:53] THAT chasm of separation from God. And
[44:56] it can't be just being raised in the
[44:57] RIGHT PLACE. YOU'VE GOT TO FALL before
[45:00] you can rise. And you've got to know
[45:01] you're fallen before you can you got TO
[45:03] KNOW YOU'RE LOST before you're saved.
[45:05] You got to know you're fallen before
[45:06] you're raised.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[45:09] &gt;&gt; So, every one of us come into the world,
[45:11] no matter what household we come into,
[45:13] no matter what truth we're surrounded
[45:14] from, we're born wrong with wrong
[45:16] desires, struggling with the lust of the
[45:18] flesh. Amen. Struggling to overcome,
[45:21] amen, the carnal nature that we were
[45:23] sold into sin
[45:25] &gt;&gt; by our parent Adam and Eve.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; And so, we must realize this. That's why
[45:32] it's so good to go through the teenage
[45:34] years and struggle with lust and wrong
[45:36] thoughts and WRONG IDEAS AND BATTLE
[45:38] AGAINST your own flesh and hate the very
[45:39] flesh you're in and tell a few lies and
[45:42] hide some things from your parents and
[45:43] get ashamed of yourself. You need to be
[45:45] utterly ashamed of yourself. You need to
[45:47] realize how bad off you are. No matter
[45:49] how many good THINGS I'VE HEARD, I CAN'T
[45:51] GET IT RIGHT. I KEEP FALLING FOR THE
[45:53] wrong thing and thinking the wrong thing
[45:55] and acting out the WRONG THING. YOU'VE
[45:57] GOT TO BE THERE FIRST SO you could work
[45:59] your way up.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to realize we're lost
[46:03] when Adam was lost and I'm born lost and
[46:05] I'm born in need and I'm born desperate
[46:09] &gt;&gt; for some other headship cuz the headship
[46:12] I'm born under failed.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the headship of Adam.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, we know that this birth is
[46:22] permissive will of God. It's not the
[46:23] perfect will of God. The way we're we're
[46:26] we're repopulating the earth now is
[46:28] under the permissive will of God. Amen.
[46:30] not the perfect will of God. Brother
[46:31] Brandham says he said it this way. Okay,
[46:33] if that's the way you want to do it,
[46:35] then go ahead.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[46:37] &gt;&gt; he let him go by his permissive will,
[46:39] but that was not his perfect will. And
[46:41] now we come to the earth this way. Amen.
[46:44] Needing redemption, needing salvation,
[46:47] needing some way back.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen and amen and amen.
[46:56] So the carnal mind is enmity against
[46:59] God.
[47:01] Ephesians 4 says, "This I say therefore
[47:04] and testify in the Lord that ye
[47:06] henceforth walk not as not as other
[47:08] Gentiles walk and the vanity of their
[47:11] mind, having their understanding
[47:12] darkened, being alienated from the life
[47:14] of God through the ignorance that is in
[47:16] them because of the blindness of their
[47:19] heart, who being past feeling have given
[47:21] themselves over into lasciviousness to
[47:23] work all uncleanness with greediness."
[47:27] He says, "I don't want you to walk this
[47:28] way that everybody else has walked.
[47:30] There's got to be something different.
[47:31] Amen. They're in the vanity of their
[47:32] minds with their understanding darkened.
[47:34] Amen. That's how we came into this
[47:36] world.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Blind with our mind darkened. And so it
[47:41] is written, "The first man, Adam, was
[47:44] made a living soul. The last Adam was
[47:47] made a quickening spirit." Amen. I love
[47:50] this scripture. It shows we had a first
[47:53] Adam, but we have a last Adam.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in Adam, we all fell.
[47:59] Amen. So, there's got to come another
[48:01] headship, another Adam. Amen. One that
[48:04] can raise man back up because there's no
[48:06] way we're hopeless and destitute and
[48:09] without a hope in the world. Unless
[48:11] there can come another Adam to take back
[48:13] what Adam lost and re regain what Adam
[48:17] forfeited. Amen. And bring us under a
[48:19] different headship. Now,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; and I love this. If I could uh look at
[48:26] this, Adam was made a living soul.
[48:29] We know that happened. Amen. When God,
[48:31] Amen, took Adam and placed him in the
[48:33] flesh and breathed the breath of life
[48:34] and he became a living soul. Amen. But
[48:38] this Adam became a quickening spirit.
[48:41] Amen. Oh, praise be to God. I get so
[48:44] excited when I look this up. Amen.
[48:46] Living and quickening are similar words.
[48:49] Quicken means to be made alive. Amen.
[48:51] But a living soul is just one that is
[48:54] alive.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:56] But a quickening SPIRIT IS SOMETHING
[48:58] THAT MAKES ALIVE.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; So Adam came a LIVING SOUL, BUT THE LAST
[49:05] ADAM CAME A QUICKENING SPIRIT. He came
[49:08] AS A FORCE THAT'LL MAKE ALIVE. THAT'LL
[49:10] BRING BACK LIFE FROM THE DEAD. AMEN.
[49:13] THAT'LL BRING WHAT'S FALLEN AND FAILED
[49:14] AND DEAD AND IN MISERY. HE'S COME BACK,
[49:17] THE LAST ADAM, TO BE A QUICKENING
[49:19] SPIRIT. THAT'S WHY HE'S QUICKENING US BY
[49:21] HIS SPIRIT. HE'S JUST NOT AN ADAM THAT
[49:24] WAS A SPIRIT MADE ALIVE. NO, IT'S MORE
[49:26] THAN THAT. HE IS THE FORCE OF GIVING
[49:28] LIFE, OF BRINGING TO LIFE, OF BRINGING
[49:30] BACK TO LIFE.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? Because Adam didn't need to
[49:36] be made a quickening spirit. Because
[49:38] nothing had fallen yet. NOTHING WAS
[49:40] DEAD. ADAM WAS MADE A LIVING SOUL. AMEN.
[49:42] And through Adam would come, living
[49:44] souls would come THE FAMILY OF GOD. HE
[49:47] WAS given the commission to populate,
[49:49] REPLENISH THE EARTH. HOW THAT WOULD
[49:50] HAPPEN IS BETWEEN HIM AND GOD.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know if he ever came to the
[49:55] revelation of it yet because they
[49:57] couldn't wait and they went on in their
[49:58] own idea and what the devil had given to
[50:00] them. But one thing's for sure, amen, he
[50:03] was A LIVING SOUL. BUT AFTER HE DIED AND
[50:06] ALL OF MANKIND DIED WITH HIM, THIS LAST
[50:09] ADAM IS GOING TO HAVE TO be more than a
[50:10] living soul. He's going to HAVE TO BE A
[50:12] QUICKENING SPIRIT THAT CAN BRING LIFE
[50:15] BACK TO THE FALLEN RACE OF ADAM. AMEN.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; OH, praise be to God Almighty, friends.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; You know what? This message
[50:26] is so precious to us.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; It makes it puts power into every
[50:35] scripture.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Puts life. And I'm not saying there was
[50:38] no power, but the misunderstanding of
[50:41] man through the church ages. Amen.
[50:43] through the through the dark age when
[50:45] they lost the revelation of the word.
[50:47] They begin to interpret it with their
[50:49] own understanding with their darkened
[50:51] minds. They begin to lose the power of
[50:53] the word because they didn't understand
[50:55] the full impact of the word because they
[50:57] didn't have the full revelation of the
[50:58] word. Amen. And you you you look at this
[51:00] message. This message has restored
[51:02] everything back to us. Amen. It's
[51:04] restored the most basic of basic
[51:06] concepts of Calvary and redemption and
[51:08] salvation. Amen. HAS PUT SUCH DEPTH AND
[51:10] SUCH POWER AND SUCH LIFE BACK into what
[51:13] the church is losing.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; They're losing by repeating stories.
[51:17] They're losing BY REPEATING SCRIPTURES.
[51:19] THEY LOST THE POWER AND THE DEPTH and
[51:20] the strength of it. BUT THIS REVELATION
[51:23] BROUGHT BACK THE DEPTH and the power and
[51:25] the strength.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Of every doctrine, of every teaching.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the last Adam,
[51:36] you know me, I've said this before, but
[51:38] I I repeat myself, but I'm going to.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. You preach 80 some times a
[51:46] year in the same pullpit. And see if you
[51:48] repeat yourself.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; last Adam.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; What a word, friends.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; The last Adam,
[51:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That means we don't need no more.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first Adam lost it all. And
[52:11] the first Adam was a son of God. But
[52:14] Adam wasn't the only son of God. Other
[52:16] sons of God would come forth. And if you
[52:18] read the Old Testament, there's always
[52:19] sons of God coming forth. Amen. And God.
[52:22] And a string of sons was working with
[52:24] his sons. And he would work with Job.
[52:26] And he would work with Noah. And he
[52:27] would work with Abraham. And he would
[52:29] work with Moses. And he'd work with them
[52:31] all. Amen. But every son that he come
[52:34] to, Amen. would create a flaw. It would
[52:36] have a flaw. would be an error. Amen.
[52:38] And and and God would become so
[52:41] disappointed.
[52:43] I mean, I say that I I hope you
[52:44] understand. God would become so
[52:46] disappointed. Even he found David a man
[52:48] after his own heart. And a man after his
[52:49] own heart fell in adultery and had a man
[52:52] killed and committed murder. Amen. To
[52:54] protect himself. But yet, he was a man
[52:56] after God's own heart. God found
[52:57] somebody he could fellowship with. One
[52:59] who understood him, one who would obey
[53:01] him and follow after his will. But even
[53:03] that man would fall in corruption.
[53:07] He had Moses and Moses would do his word
[53:09] and Moses would keep his word and Moses
[53:11] would deliver him and Moses would be his
[53:13] representative on the earth. But Moses
[53:15] in a fit of anger with frustration with
[53:17] the people who were driving him crazy,
[53:19] he would stand up and glorify himself
[53:21] and say, "Must I fetch water for you
[53:23] stiff necked people. And he SMOKED THE
[53:24] ROCK TWICE WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO SPEAK
[53:26] TO IT."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And oh, I say it again. God was
[53:32] disappointed.
[53:35] Is there nobody who could undo what Adam
[53:37] did? Is there nobody?
[53:40] And he knew there wasn't because we had
[53:42] a lamb slain before the foundation of
[53:44] the world. He had a plan, but God was
[53:46] working. Amen. And there was sons coming
[53:47] all the way down through. But there
[53:49] would come a son.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS TRYING OUT Adams all the
[53:54] way through, but there would come a last
[53:56] Adam. And you say, "Well, that wasn't
[53:57] his name. His name was Jesus Christ. He
[53:59] was the last Adam."
[54:02] ALL THE OTHER ATOMS HAD FELL, but there
[54:04] was one atom that didn't fall, which was
[54:06] the son of God on the earth.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, I'm sorry, the book of
[54:14] Revelation says, "And unto the angel of
[54:16] the church of the Leodyans, write these
[54:18] things the Amen, the faithful and true
[54:20] witness, the beginning of the creation
[54:23] of God."
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Who's speaking?
[54:27] These things say the amen. That's
[54:28] Christ. the faithful and true witness.
[54:30] That's Christ, the beginning of the
[54:32] creation of God.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; We're going to get into this in just a
[54:35] minute. In the legacy in church age, he
[54:38] says, "Now to show that he was the first
[54:40] also as he was, he's the beginning of
[54:43] the creation of God." Oh, do you catch
[54:45] it? See, how could God be created if
[54:48] he's a spirit? How could he be? He's
[54:50] eternal. He never was created. He never
[54:52] will be created because he was God at
[54:54] the beginning. But he he he that is the
[54:57] beginning of the creation of God was
[54:59] Jesus Christ when he was made manifest
[55:02] when God lived in him. He is God's
[55:05] creation. Oh my. See the first and the
[55:08] last. The amen. The beginning of the
[55:10] creation of God. When God created
[55:12] himself a body. He came down and lived
[55:14] in it. That's the beginning of the
[55:16] creation of God.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Jesus Christ was. The
[55:21] beginning of the creation of God. Our
[55:23] brother Bam said God making himself part
[55:26] of his creation.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God can't be created.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; He is the creator.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; He cannot create himself. He is the
[55:37] creator. But what he created was a body,
[55:39] a part of the earth that he could
[55:41] indwell. And he called that son. That
[55:43] was his son. That body that he stepped
[55:45] into. Amen.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians
[55:51] 15 says, "But now is Christ risen from
[55:53] the dead and become the first fruits of
[55:56] them that slept. For since by man came
[55:58] death, by man came also the resurrection
[56:01] of the dead. For as in Adam all die,
[56:04] even so in Christ shall all be made
[56:07] alive."
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's turn to Romans 5
[56:11] together.
[56:15] I told you we got a lot of scriptures.
[56:17] We're going to keep moving.
[56:19] Romans chapter 5.
[56:32] Romans 5 and verse 12
[56:36] says, "Wherefore as by one man sin
[56:39] entered into the sin entered into the
[56:41] world and death by sin, and so death
[56:43] passed upon all men, for that all have
[56:46] sinned.
[56:48] For unto the for until the law, sin was
[56:51] in the world, but sin was not imputed
[56:52] when there was no law. Nevertheless,
[56:54] death reigned from Adam to Moses, even
[56:57] over them that had not sinned after the
[56:59] simultude of Adam's transgression." Who
[57:01] is the figure of him that was to come?
[57:04] So what was Adam? He was the figure of
[57:06] him that was to come. Who is him that
[57:08] was to come?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; But not as the offense, so also is the
[57:15] free gift. For if through the offense of
[57:17] one, many be dead, much more the grace
[57:20] of God, and the gift by grace which is
[57:22] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
[57:25] unto many. Let's stop reading there for
[57:27] just a second. All eyes on me.
[57:31] I can't blank out the screen because
[57:32] you're holding your Bibles.
[57:35] Amen.
[57:37] But what I want you to see is by one
[57:39] headship we're lost.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; By one headship we're saved.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; By one all is lost. By one everything's
[57:46] made alive. By by this one you're
[57:49] doomed. By this one you're saved.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul is telling us here.
[57:54] Let's read verse 15 again. But not as
[57:57] the offense, so also is the free gift.
[57:59] For if through the offense of one Adam,
[58:02] many be dead, much more the grace of
[58:04] God, and the gift by grace, which is by
[58:07] one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
[58:10] unto many.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Has it abounded to you?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] And not as it was by by one that sin, so
[58:19] is the gift. For the judgment was by one
[58:21] to condemnation, but the free gift is of
[58:25] many offenses unto justification.
[58:28] He's saying there was one offense that
[58:31] led everyone to death.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; But now in Christ, there's many
[58:36] offenses, which is all of our offenses,
[58:38] all of our transgressions, everything
[58:40] we've done wrong. But the free gift is
[58:43] of many offenses unto justification.
[58:46] He's justifying us for them all. Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; For if by one man's offense death
[58:52] reigned by one, much more they which
[58:55] receive abundance of grace and of the
[58:56] gift of righteousness shall reign in
[58:58] life by one Jesus Christ. Therefore, as
[59:02] by the offense of one judgment came upon
[59:04] all men to condemnation, even so by the
[59:07] righteousness of one, the free gift came
[59:10] upon all men unto justification of life.
[59:13] For as by one man's disobedience, many
[59:16] were made sinners, so by the obedience
[59:18] of one shall many be made righteous.
[59:21] Moreover, the law entered that the
[59:23] offense might abound. But where sin
[59:25] abounded, grace did much more abound.
[59:28] That as sin hath reigned into death,
[59:30] even so might grace reign through
[59:31] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[59:34] Christ our Lord.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I was sold into sin. I was a slave to
[59:41] sin. I come to the world with my mind at
[59:43] enmity with God. My my my senses
[59:46] darkened to the things of God. An enemy
[59:48] to God. Hating the things of God. A
[59:50] transgressor from the beginning and been
[59:52] given over to the lust of the flesh.
[59:54] That's how I started. And I started that
[59:56] way because of Adam.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Because of one man and because of one
[1:00:01] offense. But oh, praise God. If by one
[1:00:05] man many offenses come, now the many
[1:00:07] offenses going to be turned to
[1:00:08] righteousness by one man. One man will
[1:00:11] reverse what one man did. And what was
[1:00:13] that one man? He was the head of a
[1:00:15] family. And because I'm part of that
[1:00:16] family by my natural sex birth, Amen.
[1:00:19] I'm doomed. Amen. But there come another
[1:00:21] headship to the family of God. And in
[1:00:24] that one man with his one ACT DOING ONE
[1:00:27] THING. EVERYBODY that comes under that
[1:00:29] headship GETS THE BENEFIT OF THAT
[1:00:31] HEADSHIP. AMEN.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; IF I SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF HEADSHIP OF
[1:00:36] ADAM, WHY CANNOT I SUFFER THE EFFECTS OF
[1:00:39] THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST?
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; AND IF THE POWER OF THE HEADSHIP OF ADAM
[1:00:44] BRINGS EVERY ONE OF US TO DEATH AND
[1:00:46] sickness and we're SUFFERING FROM IT
[1:00:48] NOW, WE HAD A FUNERAL SERVICE YESTERDAY.
[1:00:50] AMEN. YOU PASS CEMETERIES EVERY DAY AND
[1:00:52] PEOPLE ARE GOING in there day AFTER DAY
[1:00:54] AFTER DAY. THAT'S THE POWER OF HEADSHIP.
[1:00:56] IF THAT HEADSHIP IS THAT POWERFUL AND
[1:00:58] IRREVERSIBLE AND IRREVOCABLE IN THIS
[1:01:00] LIFE, WHAT ABOUT THIS HEADSHIP OF
[1:01:02] CHRIST? IS IT JUST AS POWERFUL TO BRING
[1:01:05] ME LIFE?
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; AND I WAS BORN DOOMED BEFORE I DID
[1:01:09] WRONG.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; AND I WAS BROUGHT UNDER HEADSHIP OF LIFE
[1:01:14] BEFORE I DID RIGHT.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WASN'T MY DEEDS. I'VE DONE
[1:01:20] DEEDS. SURE. I'M WORTHY OF ALL KINDS OF
[1:01:22] JUDGMENT. I I SUFFER MY OWN DEEDS. AMEN.
[1:01:24] BUT I WAS BORN WRONG BY THE DEEDS OF
[1:01:26] ANOTHER. BUT UNDER A NEW BIRTH,
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; UNDER A SPIRITUAL NEW BIRTH. I COME
[1:01:32] UNDER THE DEEDS OF SOMEONE ELSE. NOT MY
[1:01:35] DEEDS, HIS DEEDS. And his deeds declared
[1:01:37] him the HEAD OF THE FAMILY. THE ONE
[1:01:39] WHO'S RIGHTEOUS. THE LAST ADAM. TAKING
[1:01:42] BACK WHAT ADAM LOST. AND NOW UNDER THAT
[1:01:44] HEADSHIP, I'M DECLARED RIGHTEOUS.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; NOT WITH MY RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT with his
[1:01:50] righteousness.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:55] This is the FALL OF MAN AND ADAM. BUT
[1:01:57] WHAT IS THE RISE OF MAN? THE LAST ADAM.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; This isn't US GETTING BETTER. THIS ISN'T
[1:02:02] US FIGURING ANYTHING OUT. This isn't us
[1:02:04] correcting our behavior. AMEN. THIS IS
[1:02:07] FINDING THE RIGHT HEADSHIP. FINDING THE
[1:02:09] RIGHT ONE. AMEN. THAT I AM ATTACHED TO.
[1:02:11] AMEN. AND I WAS ATTACHED WITHOUT MY
[1:02:14] WILL, WITHOUT MY DECISION TO ADAM. BUT
[1:02:17] NOW, AMEN. BY THE CHOICE OF GOD, BY
[1:02:19] PREDESTINATION, HE SAW FIT TO ATTACH ME
[1:02:21] TO THIS HEADSHIP. AND HE PLANTED INSIDE
[1:02:24] OF MY SOUL BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:02:26] WORLD A SEED GENE OF ETERNAL LIFE THAT
[1:02:28] WHEN I WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH THIS
[1:02:30] JESUS CHRIST, SOMETHING IN ME WOULD SAY
[1:02:32] THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH THAT I
[1:02:34] BELIEVE AND BY FAITH YOU ARE SAVED.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; We found another headship.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; And in that headship, brother Chad, I
[1:02:43] still make I make bad decisions. Who's
[1:02:46] your head?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Who's interceding for the family?
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Remember the job of Job? AMEN. JOB WAS
[1:02:52] OUT THERE. Job was out there OFFERING A
[1:02:55] LAMB PER ADVENTURE, HIS CHILDREN might
[1:02:57] have sinned. Amen. What was he? He was
[1:03:00] the headship OVER HIS FAMILY. AND GOD
[1:03:02] HONORED JOB'S HEADSHIP. AND GOD HONORED
[1:03:04] JOB'S FAITH. AND BECAUSE OF JOB'S FAITH
[1:03:07] IN THE SACRIFICE, JOB GOT ALL OF HIS
[1:03:09] CHILDREN BACK.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; WHY? God honored his headship.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:03:21] Praise God Almighty.
[1:03:24] Even in the natural, Amen. Israel was
[1:03:26] blessed when it had a godly king. Israel
[1:03:28] was cursed when it had an ungodly king.
[1:03:30] Why? That's the power of headship.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Almighty God.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to ask you a question.
[1:03:42] When Hadtie writes, "Two boys were
[1:03:43] saved,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; whose faith did God honor?"
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Their faith or their mother's faith,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; their mother's faith,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; and their father, they were under their
[1:03:57] mother. Amen. When she said the right
[1:03:59] thing, God said, "What do you want? I
[1:04:01] want the salvation of my two boys." And
[1:04:02] he honored her faith.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; And he saved those two boys.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] Hey, God Almighty.
[1:04:11] I love it.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Let's let's turn to Hebrews chapter 2
[1:04:16] together. We're going to come back to
[1:04:18] Romans. So, if you want to save your
[1:04:19] finger in Romans or throw a pen there or
[1:04:22] something, we're coming back.
[1:04:25] Hebrews chapter 2,
[1:04:31] verse 10.
[1:04:37] Hebrews chapter 2:10, for it became him
[1:04:40] for whom are all things, and by whom are
[1:04:42] all things, and bringing many sons into
[1:04:45] glory, to make the captain of their
[1:04:47] salvation perfect through suffering. For
[1:04:49] both he that sanctifith, and they who
[1:04:52] are sanctified are all of one. Oh my
[1:04:55] goodness. I just can't I can't hardly
[1:04:57] take it, friends.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; He who sanctifith, which is Jesus
[1:05:02] Christ. And those who are sanctified,
[1:05:04] which are us,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; we're all of one.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; We have one father.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; We come from the mind of God. We have
[1:05:12] one father. Amen. And he said they are
[1:05:15] all of one. For which cause he is not
[1:05:20] ashamed to call them brethren.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; He is our brother.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Adam is also our
[1:05:28] brother? Yeah.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you talk about mankind, we're
[1:05:33] brothers.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Right. We're brethren. We all come from
[1:05:36] the same father. Amen. When if Adam
[1:05:39] would have brought forth the seed of God
[1:05:42] correctly upon the earth, everyone that
[1:05:44] would have come forth with Adam would
[1:05:45] have been his son and his brother.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Because they would have all been the
[1:05:51] children of God.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You you know when when Eve when
[1:05:55] the woman came out of Adam, that was his
[1:05:58] wife. She was part of him, but that was
[1:06:00] also his sister.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Because they were all under the same
[1:06:05] headship.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Of God.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ, the one who sanctifith,
[1:06:12] and we who are sanctified are all of
[1:06:14] one. And that's why he's not ashamed to
[1:06:17] call us brethren.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; What kind of brother is he? He's our big
[1:06:22] brother.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the family. He's the
[1:06:27] one who gets the inheritance.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; He's the one. What What inheritance does
[1:06:34] he get? The inheritance that Adam lost.
[1:06:36] The first son was given the inheritance.
[1:06:38] The inheritance was the right to rule
[1:06:39] over the earth and dominion over the
[1:06:41] earth. He lost it. Now there's an
[1:06:43] inheritance waiting. Amen. Now we're
[1:06:45] waiting for a big brother. We're
[1:06:46] waiting.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; We're waiting for a head of the family
[1:06:49] to come on the scene. The big brother,
[1:06:51] the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; The firstborn gets the right of
[1:06:57] inheritance. And now he becomes the
[1:06:59] firstborn of many brethren. And the
[1:07:02] firstborn gets the inheritance. Amen.
[1:07:04] And the inher Oh my goodness. And the
[1:07:06] inheritance he buys back for the whole
[1:07:08] family.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And he is not ashamed to call us
[1:07:13] brethren. Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, I would be ashamed to call me
[1:07:16] brethren
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; of all the things I've done and do and
[1:07:20] the attitudes I take and the things I
[1:07:22] do. But he's not ashamed to call us
[1:07:24] brethren because he knows something we
[1:07:26] don't know. He knows what happened at
[1:07:28] the beginning, how we've fallen to ruin,
[1:07:30] what we're struggling with. LISTEN,
[1:07:32] WE'VE GOT COMPLEXES and we've got ideas
[1:07:34] and we've got traditions and we've got
[1:07:36] all of that stuff, friends. But God can
[1:07:38] see all the way through that AND HE
[1:07:39] UNDERSTANDS THAT'S my son down there in
[1:07:42] that soul. That's my son. THAT'S FROM MY
[1:07:44] THOUGHT. THAT'S A THOUGHT. AMEN. THAT
[1:07:46] HAS FALLEN into the world and I'm
[1:07:48] redeeming that back. And Jesus Christ
[1:07:50] knew he was coming for his brethren.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And he's not ashamed to call us
[1:07:57] brethren,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; saying, I will declare thy name unto my
[1:08:00] brethren. In the midst of the church
[1:08:02] will I sing praise unto thee. And again,
[1:08:05] I will put my trust in him. And again,
[1:08:07] behold, I and the children which God
[1:08:10] hath given me. For as much then as the
[1:08:12] children are partakers of flesh and
[1:08:14] blood, he also himself likewise took
[1:08:17] part of the same, that through death he
[1:08:20] might destroy him that had the power of
[1:08:22] death, that is the devil, and deliver
[1:08:24] them who through fear of death were all
[1:08:27] their lifetime subject to bondage. For
[1:08:30] verily who took not on him the nature of
[1:08:32] angels, but he took on him the seed of
[1:08:35] Abraham, he became like us.
[1:08:40] Wherefore in all things he behooved him
[1:08:42] to be made like unto his brethren, that
[1:08:45] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[1:08:47] priest in all things pertaining to God,
[1:08:49] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:08:52] the people. For in that he himself has
[1:08:55] suffered being tempted, he is able to
[1:08:57] secure them that are tempted.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He came down and
[1:09:02] became one of us
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; so that he could redeem back his
[1:09:07] brethren. Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. I'm so glad he's
[1:09:12] not ashamed. I'm certainly not ashamed
[1:09:13] to call him my brother, my Lord, my
[1:09:16] Savior, my God, my all and all, but I'm
[1:09:18] so glad he's not ashamed to call us
[1:09:20] brethren.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; In John 19:4, the scripture says,
[1:09:26] "Pilate therefore went forth again and
[1:09:28] said unto them, behold, I bring him
[1:09:30] forth to you that ye may know that I
[1:09:32] find no fault in him."
[1:09:35] Then came Jesus forth wearing the crown
[1:09:36] of thorns and the purple robe. And
[1:09:38] Pilate saith unto them, "Behold the
[1:09:40] man."
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; This statement, oh my goodness, friends,
[1:09:43] this statement right here,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a man
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; because it was a man who lost redemption
[1:09:56] rights,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; the right to rule, lost the inheritance.
[1:09:59] It was a man and only a man who could
[1:10:02] redeem back those rights. Yeah,
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; he couldn't take on him the form of an
[1:10:06] angel, but he had to take on him the
[1:10:07] seed of Abraham. He had to be made into
[1:10:09] flesh like his brethren made flesh.
[1:10:11] That's the only way he could come and
[1:10:13] buy back what man lost is to become a
[1:10:15] man to win back what man lost.
[1:10:18] And I want you to look at this. Pilate
[1:10:21] is the authority in the region under the
[1:10:23] Roman rule. And the authority, they
[1:10:25] bring Jesus to the authority because
[1:10:27] they don't have the authority to kill
[1:10:28] him. So they bring him to the authority.
[1:10:30] Who's Pilate? Who's governor of the
[1:10:31] region? And Pilate examines him and
[1:10:33] Pilate talks to him and Pilate scourges
[1:10:35] him and Pilate says, "I find no fault in
[1:10:38] him."
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; God makes even secular leaders testify
[1:10:45] to his gospel truth. This is a lamb
[1:10:47] WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE. I'VE PUT HIM TO
[1:10:50] THE TEST. He's at the judgment seat of
[1:10:52] the highest ruling authority in the
[1:10:53] land. And at the seat of the highest
[1:10:55] judging authority in the land, that
[1:10:57] judge says, "THERE IS NO FAULT in this
[1:11:00] one." And then HE BRINGS HIM OUT AND
[1:11:03] THEY'VE MOCKED HIM AS A KING. THEY MADE
[1:11:05] FUN of him with a a crown of thorns and
[1:11:07] a purple robe and they've mocked him AS
[1:11:09] KING OF THE JEWS, DECLARING he's their
[1:11:11] king. Even though they're mocking him,
[1:11:13] HE'S THE KING. THE WHOLE SCENE IS SET TO
[1:11:16] DECLARE WHAT GOD IS DOING. AND PILATE
[1:11:18] SAYS, "I FIND NO FAULT IN HIM. HE IS
[1:11:22] PERFECT IN EVERY WAY." AND THEN HE SHOWS
[1:11:24] HIM TO THE THE CROWD. HE SAYS, "BEHOLD
[1:11:27] THE MAN."
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; What man? The man. The man. It has TO BE
[1:11:32] A MAN. THIS IS THE MAN. NO OTHER MAN CAN
[1:11:36] DO IT. BUT THIS IS THE MAN THAT CAN TAKE
[1:11:38] AWAY SINS. THIS IS THE MAN THAT CAN BUY
[1:11:41] BACK THE INHERITANCE OF MAN. THIS IS THE
[1:11:44] MAN.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; OH, PILATE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS
[1:11:47] SAYING, BUT HE WAS MOVED BY GOD. GOD WAS
[1:11:50] BRINGING AN ANOINTING ON THE SCENE THAT
[1:11:52] THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE LAND WOULD
[1:11:54] STAND BEFORE THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. ARE
[1:11:56] THE HIGH PRIEST, THE CHIEF PRIESTS, THE
[1:11:58] POLITICAL LEADERS OF THE LAND. AND THEY
[1:12:00] WOULD SAY THERE'S NO FAULT IN THIS MAN.
[1:12:03] THIS IS THE ONLY MAN SINCE ADAM FELL
[1:12:06] THAT'S PERFECT.
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "BEHOLD," WHICH MEANS,
[1:12:12] "LOOK."
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; "BEHOLD THE MAN."
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; "OH, HOW I WISH I COULD BE THERE THAT
[1:12:20] DAY. I WOULD SCREAM WITH ALL THAT'S IN
[1:12:22] ME. THAT'S MY LORD. THAT'S THE LAST
[1:12:25] ADAM. HE'S BUYING IT BACK FOR ME.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD THE MAN. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S THE
[1:12:32] MAN.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY MAN. THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE
[1:12:36] the man.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Friends, what a what a treasure we hold
[1:12:44] in our hearts.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; What a reality this is to us. IT'S NOT
[1:12:48] AN EXCITING SERMON. IT'S NOT A SUNDAY
[1:12:50] SCHOOL STORY. IT'S THE REALITY THAT
[1:12:52] WE'RE LIVING IN AND WALKING IN. We've
[1:12:55] been given another headship.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Behold
[1:13:00] the man. I think this is one of the most
[1:13:01] profound things written in scriptures.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to Romans 6 verse three.
[1:13:11] Romans 6:3.
[1:13:19] Know you not that so many of you as were
[1:13:22] baptized unto Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:13:24] unto his death? Therefore, we are buried
[1:13:27] with him by baptism unto death, that
[1:13:29] like as Christ was raised from the dead
[1:13:31] by the glory of the Father, even so we
[1:13:34] also would walk in newness of life. For
[1:13:38] if we have been planted together in the
[1:13:39] likeness of his death, we shall be also
[1:13:42] in the likeness of his resurrection.
[1:13:44] Knowing this, that our old man is
[1:13:47] crucified with him, that the body of sin
[1:13:49] might be destroyed, that that the body
[1:13:52] of sin might be destroyed, that
[1:13:53] henceforth we should not serve sin. For
[1:13:56] he that is dead is free from sin. Now if
[1:13:58] we be dead with Christ, we believe that
[1:14:01] we shall also live with him, knowing
[1:14:03] that Christ being raised from the dead
[1:14:05] dieth no more. Death hath no more
[1:14:07] dominion over him. For in that he died,
[1:14:10] he died unto sin once, but in that he
[1:14:12] liveth, he liveth unto God.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And he ever liveth
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; to make intercession.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Listen, he listen, when we come to water
[1:14:24] baptism in Jesus' name, this is one of
[1:14:28] the truths that was restored in the end
[1:14:29] time. But listen, this isn't a trivial
[1:14:32] thing.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a light thing on the
[1:14:35] side. We figured out that through the
[1:14:36] dark ages, they got water baptism wrong.
[1:14:38] when they went to the trinitarian idea.
[1:14:40] Why did the devil take them to the
[1:14:41] trinitarian idea? Why did this truth GET
[1:14:43] OBSCURED? WHY WHY WAS IT WHY WAS IT
[1:14:46] LOST? Why was the truth of it lost?
[1:14:48] Amen. Because the reality is that we
[1:14:51] needed another headship. And that
[1:14:53] headship is found in the person of Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ, the man.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; The man. The man that died for me. The
[1:15:01] man that was my substitutionary
[1:15:02] offering. I could no longer take a
[1:15:04] substitute as a lamb or a goat. Amen.
[1:15:06] because their life couldn't atone for
[1:15:08] mine. That was just a covering for sin
[1:15:10] temporarily until the lamb of God could
[1:15:12] come. And the lamb of God was a body
[1:15:14] that he created. Amen. That body of
[1:15:17] Jesus Christ. And he was declared by
[1:15:19] Pilate to have no fault.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; He could go right to crucifixion because
[1:15:24] he's already been proved.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And shown before the the the high
[1:15:29] priest.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; this one is without spot or blemish
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; and go straight to Calvary.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Now, water baptism in the name of the
[1:15:41] Lord Jesus Christ is declaring my new
[1:15:44] headship.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; It's not just a doctrine, friends. It's
[1:15:48] not just a teaching. It's an absolute
[1:15:51] declaration to the world that now I have
[1:15:54] died to my old life. I have died to my
[1:15:57] old nature. I have died to that first
[1:15:59] birth. I have died to all that I was and
[1:16:01] all that I thought I was and all the
[1:16:03] confusion I came into the world. I died
[1:16:05] to the old person to the old chad to
[1:16:07] everything THAT MATTERED TO ME. I'M DEAD
[1:16:10] BECAUSE I WANT TO LEAVE THAT headship
[1:16:12] and I want to take the headship of Jesus
[1:16:14] Christ. So I come to the waters of
[1:16:16] baptism. Amen. And declare to the world
[1:16:19] that I am dead to what I was. But I'm
[1:16:21] coming under this headship OF JESUS
[1:16:24] CHRIST. I WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED with
[1:16:26] this man. Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; This man, NOT THE MAN FROM EDEN. THIS
[1:16:30] MAN,
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I COME BORN IN SIN, SHAPE IN INIQUITY,
[1:16:33] COME TO THE WORLD SPEAKING LIES,
[1:16:35] IDENTIFIED WITH THAT MAN FROM EDEN. BUT
[1:16:37] OH, IF I CAN DIE TO THAT, TO THAT
[1:16:39] HEADSHIP, TO THAT MAN, AND TAKE the
[1:16:41] headship that's offered TO ME AND
[1:16:44] TESTIFY TO THE WORLD THAT THIS IS MY
[1:16:46] HEAD BY BEING BAPTIZED IN HIS NAME. NOW,
[1:16:48] I'M COMING UNDER THIS HEADSHIP, DYING TO
[1:16:51] THAT, COMING TO LIFE UNDER THIS
[1:16:53] HEADSHIP.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And I ask you friends, if the power of
[1:16:59] that headship affected me all of my
[1:17:01] life, what will the power of this
[1:17:02] headship do?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, these aren't fables. These
[1:17:07] aren't these aren't uh little stories.
[1:17:10] Amen. This is the reality IN OUR LIFE.
[1:17:12] IF BY FAITH we can see a TRANSFER OF OUR
[1:17:14] LIFE, I DON'T WANT THIS LIFE ANYMORE. I
[1:17:16] RECOGNIZE THAT I'M I'M NOTHING. AMEN. I
[1:17:19] was born wrong and everything in me is
[1:17:21] WRONG AND I'M ALL TWISTED UP IN MY MIND
[1:17:23] AND I'M ALL TWISTED UP WITH WRONG
[1:17:25] DESIRES AND I HATE the way I was born
[1:17:27] and I hate the way I was put together.
[1:17:29] Amen. And I realize that comes FROM
[1:17:31] EDEN. BUT GOD, I DON'T WANT THAT
[1:17:33] ANYMORE. ALL I WANT IS YOUR LIFE IN ME.
[1:17:36] ALL I WANT IS TO SERVE YOU AND I WANT TO
[1:17:38] COME UNDER a no headship. I WANT A NEW
[1:17:40] CAPTAIN of the host. I want a new
[1:17:41] captain OF THE ARMY. I WANT MY CHIEF
[1:17:43] CAPTAIN TO BE THE MAN,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus.
[1:17:48] And under that headship, I rest.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; REST.
[1:17:54] NO MORE FEAR. NO MORE BONDAGE OF SIN. NO
[1:17:57] MORE BONDAGE OF DEATH. BECAUSE HE
[1:17:58] ABSOLVED ME FROM ALL SIN. WHEN HE WAS
[1:18:01] FOUND TO BE FAULTLESS AND WENT TO
[1:18:03] CALVARY, HE WAS MY SUBSTITUTE. NOT A
[1:18:06] GOAT, NOT A SHEEP, NOT A TURTLE DOVE,
[1:18:08] BUT A MAN, a human being to pay the
[1:18:11] price for mankind. AND HE BECAME THE
[1:18:14] FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BRETHREN. HE BECAME
[1:18:16] THE HEAD OF THAT FAMILY. AND WHEN the
[1:18:18] head of the FAMILY PAID THE PRICE FOR
[1:18:20] THE FAMILY, HE BECAME THE HEADSHIP OF
[1:18:22] THE FAMILY. NOW EVERYTHING UNDER THE
[1:18:25] FAMILY is blessed under that headship.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Now it's NOT MY WORKS. IT'S NOT MY
[1:18:30] DEEDS. IT'S my headship.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Chad, we can get away
[1:18:42] with anything. If you take it that way,
[1:18:44] you can get away with murder. Some have.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Some have gotten away with drunkenness
[1:18:58] and adultery and murder and fornication
[1:19:01] of all kinds
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; and lies.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he paid the price for me.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; He never asked me to pay it. I couldn't
[1:19:10] pay it. I was across the chasm.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; There's nothing I could do to get my way
[1:19:15] back. So, he paid the price for me.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And how many former drunks and
[1:19:19] adulterers have come under a new
[1:19:21] headship?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And under this new headship, everything
[1:19:25] else is absolved because he stood in my
[1:19:28] place and he paid the price for my sin.
[1:19:31] Past, present,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; and future.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; As long as I stay under this headship, I
[1:19:38] get the benefit of the headship. If I
[1:19:39] leave the headship, I leave the benefit
[1:19:41] of the headship. that if I stay under
[1:19:42] this headship,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that I don't I shouldn't
[1:19:46] still do right. I must do right. I must
[1:19:48] stay under the headship. He's my
[1:19:50] headship. So whatever he says, whatever
[1:19:52] he dictates, THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A LAW
[1:19:54] to me.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Because he said it. It's my it's my love
[1:19:57] law. I want to keep it by love. I want
[1:19:59] to honor him in every way. But listen,
[1:20:02] as much as I try, I still fail.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; As much as you try, you still fail. As
[1:20:07] hard as we've tried to do everything
[1:20:08] right, we still get it wrong. BUT PRAISE
[1:20:10] GOD, EVEN WHEN I'm wrong, I'm still
[1:20:13] under the headship. And the headship
[1:20:14] brings me back into his headship and
[1:20:17] back into repentance. And he chasens me
[1:20:19] and he corrects me and he gets me right
[1:20:21] BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH. BUT HE'S NOT
[1:20:23] GOING TO LOSE ME. He shed his blood FOR
[1:20:25] ME. AMEN. I'M PART OF THE BRETHREN. I'M
[1:20:27] UNDER HIS HEADSHIP. AND UNDER his
[1:20:29] headship, I'm secure.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Without his headship, I'm lost and dead
[1:20:35] and doomed and in darkness. Yeah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But under his headship, I have life and
[1:20:42] resurrection and freedom and light and
[1:20:46] love and everything else that's provided
[1:20:48] for us.
[1:20:50] In Ephesians chapter 2, he says, "But
[1:20:53] God who is rich in mercy,
[1:20:56] but God who is rich in mercy, for his
[1:20:58] great love wherewith he loved us, even
[1:21:00] when we were dead in sins, hath
[1:21:01] quickened us together with Christ."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You mean I've already been quickened?
[1:21:08] Why? When the head of the family went
[1:21:10] up, the whole family went up.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's the head of the family.
[1:21:15] And he re represents the whole family.
[1:21:18] Let's go back just so we understand
[1:21:19] this.
[1:21:21] When the head of the family fell, the
[1:21:23] whole family fell.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? And Adam
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; and Adam all died.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; So when the head of the family rose,
[1:21:32] what happened to the whole family?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:36] [Applause]
[1:21:37] Listen, we don't understand. We have to
[1:21:39] understand this is all about headship
[1:21:41] and representation. And he is my
[1:21:43] representation and he is my headship and
[1:21:45] it's all on him.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Has quickened us together with Christ.
[1:21:50] By grace you are saved. And raised us up
[1:21:53] together and made us sit together in
[1:21:55] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, we
[1:21:58] say all the time, "Oh, if I could just
[1:22:00] get to heaven, I can't wait to sit on
[1:22:01] the throne." You're already sitting on
[1:22:03] the throne. Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Chad, you're already He hath
[1:22:10] raised us up together. Listen, I want to
[1:22:13] ask you a question. Are you included in
[1:22:15] that word?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; By faith, I believe it. I'm included in
[1:22:22] that word. He has raised us up together
[1:22:24] and made us, Here it is again.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Sit together in heavenly places in
[1:22:31] Christ Jesus. Amen. I hope I make it to
[1:22:34] heaven. I hope I get there someday.
[1:22:36] Listen, when he made it, I made it.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT UP, I WENT UP. AMEN. WHEN
[1:22:41] HE RESURRECTED, I RESURRECTED. THIS IS
[1:22:43] WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM teaches us. THIS
[1:22:45] IS WHAT PAUL TEACHES US. WE'VE ALREADY
[1:22:47] MADE IT. WHY HAVE WE MADE IT? BECAUSE
[1:22:49] THE HEADSHIP OF THE family made it. AND
[1:22:51] WHEN HE MADE IT, EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:22:53] ATTACHED TO THAT FAMILY MADE IT ALSO. I
[1:22:57] MADE IT IN HIS REPRESENTATION. I made it
[1:22:59] in him. And in him, I'm already there.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] That's why it's for me. I want to stay
[1:23:10] in his headship.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "Therefore, if
[1:23:15] any man be in Christ, he is a new
[1:23:17] creature.
[1:23:19] Old things are passed away." What are
[1:23:21] old things? That first life.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, all things are become new,
[1:23:25] and all things are of God, who has
[1:23:27] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:23:28] Christ, and hath given us the ministry
[1:23:31] of reconciliation.
[1:23:33] So all things are become new, and all
[1:23:35] things are of God, who has reconciled us
[1:23:38] to himself by Jesus Christ. So how did
[1:23:41] he get us back to himself? by making a
[1:23:45] new head of the family
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; and by letting that new head of the
[1:23:49] family live a perfect life, fulfill all
[1:23:51] the law of God without flaw
[1:23:54] and then die as a substitutionary
[1:23:57] offering for all of fallen man.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; And he reconciled me to himself by Jesus
[1:24:04] Christ.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; This is why it's so important to be
[1:24:09] identified with Jesus Christ.
[1:24:15] Brother M says in the message and
[1:24:16] knoweth it not. He said and God is a
[1:24:18] creator and how was he ever created? But
[1:24:21] this is the beginning of the creation of
[1:24:23] God. When God the spirit was created in
[1:24:25] a form of a man, that was God being
[1:24:28] created. God the creator himself
[1:24:30] becoming a creation. God who made the
[1:24:32] dirt, made the calcium, made the pot
[1:24:34] ash, cosmic light, petroleum, took the
[1:24:36] thing together and created it. created
[1:24:38] himself in the beginning of the creation
[1:24:41] of God.
[1:24:43] Again, he says in proving his word, he
[1:24:45] says he proved the word by saying he was
[1:24:47] Jehovah made manifest. He was the
[1:24:49] beginning of the creation of God. God in
[1:24:52] creation, God with a little part of the
[1:24:54] creation here that God was living in
[1:24:56] himself. He was the beginning of that
[1:24:59] creation of God. From him begets many
[1:25:02] sons.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; This is what was supposed to happen in
[1:25:06] Eden.
[1:25:07] Yeah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what was supposed to
[1:25:10] happen in Eden from Adam was supposed to
[1:25:12] be many sons. Amen. But then the sons
[1:25:15] that begat begget by the by by by the
[1:25:18] sexual desire of his own will and by the
[1:25:20] permissive will of God and everybody
[1:25:22] comes wrong and come trapped in sin.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; But now this is what brother Bam says.
[1:25:29] Now God was living in a portion of
[1:25:32] creation himself. He was the beginning
[1:25:34] of that creation of God. And from him,
[1:25:37] the last Adam, the restored man,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; he beggets many sons.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:25:47] Through spiritual birth.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Not natural birth this time, but through
[1:25:51] spiritual birth, he beggets many sons.
[1:25:55] For whom he did forno, he also did
[1:25:57] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:26:00] image of his son, that he might be the
[1:26:02] firstborn among many brethren. There's
[1:26:06] that word firstborn.
[1:26:08] He is the head of the family. And if I'm
[1:26:11] one of the many brethren,
[1:26:14] then I get the benefit of the firstborn.
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We have a champion. We
[1:26:24] have a captain. We have the head of the
[1:26:25] family. We are blessed. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; In the legacy in church age from the
[1:26:32] church age book the prophet says this.
[1:26:34] This new creation is not the old
[1:26:36] creation made over or it could not be
[1:26:39] called a new creation. He's talking
[1:26:40] about you and your new birth. This is
[1:26:43] exactly what it says. It is new
[1:26:45] creation. It is not another creation
[1:26:47] distinct from the old one. It is another
[1:26:49] creation distinct from the old one. No
[1:26:51] longer is he dealing by ways of the
[1:26:53] flesh. That was how he dealt with
[1:26:55] Israel. He chose Abraham and of
[1:26:57] Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac
[1:26:59] line. But now out of every kindred,
[1:27:02] tribe and nation, he has purposed a new
[1:27:04] creation. He is the first of that
[1:27:07] creation. He was God created in the form
[1:27:10] of a man. Now by his spirit, he is
[1:27:12] creating many sons into himself. God the
[1:27:15] creator creating himself a part of his
[1:27:18] creation.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's take our time.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Let's not breathe through this. Amen. He
[1:27:25] listen he is he is no longer dealing in
[1:27:29] the ways of flesh.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; That's how he started with Adam
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; and it failed. That's how he was coming
[1:27:37] through the Abrahamic line. Amen. He was
[1:27:39] dealing with that. But now Paul comes
[1:27:41] and tells us, "No, no, no. It's not the
[1:27:43] natural line of Abraham anymore. It's
[1:27:45] the faith seed of Abraham, the royal
[1:27:47] line. Those that believe are children of
[1:27:49] Abraham by faith."
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; So he's no longer dealing by the ways of
[1:27:53] flesh. That's how he dealt with Israel.
[1:27:56] BUT NOW OUT OF EVERY KID, IT DOESN'T
[1:27:59] MATTER where you were born. It doesn't
[1:28:00] matter your nationality. It doesn't
[1:28:02] matter who your parents were. None of
[1:28:04] that matters because THIS IS NOT ABOUT
[1:28:06] FLESH ANYMORE. NOW, he was the
[1:28:08] beginning. Jesus Christ was the
[1:28:10] beginning of the creation of God where
[1:28:12] God would take a part of his creation
[1:28:14] and he would make a body for himself to
[1:28:16] express him and that was Jesus Christ.
[1:28:18] AND HE WOULD DWELL in it reconciling the
[1:28:20] world unto himself.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT FROM THERE NOW HE'S GOING TO
[1:28:25] DO amen what Adam failed to do. And now
[1:28:28] he's going to be get many sons. But
[1:28:30] how's he going to do it? REMEMBER THE
[1:28:32] LAST ADAM BECAME A QUICKENING SPIRIT.
[1:28:35] Now it's going to BE BY THE QUICKENING
[1:28:37] POWER OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. HE'S GOING
[1:28:39] TO COME IN AND HE'S going to bring A NEW
[1:28:41] CREATION OUT OF OUR FLESH.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS FLESH, BROTHER SAID, IS
[1:28:46] STILL A STICKY COCKER NATURE. AMEN. THE
[1:28:49] OUTSIDE IS STILL STICKY COCOA, BUT
[1:28:51] INSIDE IS A NEW MAN MADE AFTER CHRIST
[1:28:53] JESUS BEING FORMED INTO THE IMAGE of his
[1:28:55] son.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; But he purposed a new creation. He is
[1:29:03] the first of that creation. He was God
[1:29:06] created in the FORM OF MAN. NOW BY HIS
[1:29:08] SPIRIT, he is creating many sons into
[1:29:11] himself. By what? The new birth. By the
[1:29:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Spiritual new
[1:29:17] birth. He is creating many sons into
[1:29:19] himself. And that that spirit is none
[1:29:21] other but the spirit of God coming to
[1:29:23] indwell his children. And God the
[1:29:26] creator creating himself part of his
[1:29:28] creation.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the beginning of the
[1:29:32] creation of God but not the finish. God
[1:29:35] is still moving down into creation
[1:29:37] through spiritual birth through new
[1:29:38] creatures. Now he's dwelling in
[1:29:41] humanity. HE'S DWELLING IN A BODY, THE
[1:29:43] BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:48] And that body has one headship.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; This is the true revelation of God. This
[1:29:58] was his purpose. This purpose took form
[1:30:01] through election.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That is why he could look right down to
[1:30:04] the last age when all would be over and
[1:30:06] see himself still in the midst of the
[1:30:09] church as the author of this new
[1:30:11] creation of God.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Are you part of the new creation? AMEN.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT? BY spiritual birth, he begget
[1:30:21] sons, and he's come, Amen, to live in
[1:30:24] those sons.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; To become part of his creation.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Colossians says, "And he is the head of
[1:30:31] the body, the church, who is the
[1:30:33] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[1:30:35] that in all things he might have the
[1:30:37] preeminence. For it pleased the Father
[1:30:39] that in him should all fullness dwell,
[1:30:41] and having made peace through the blood
[1:30:43] of his cross, by him to reconcile all
[1:30:45] things unto himself. By him, I say,
[1:30:47] whether they be things in earth or
[1:30:49] things in heaven, and you that were
[1:30:51] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[1:30:54] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he
[1:30:56] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:30:59] through death to present you holy and
[1:31:02] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:31:04] sight.
[1:31:06] I hope you can see this.
[1:31:10] try to make it thick.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; How's he going to present us holy and
[1:31:17] unblameable and reprovable in his sight
[1:31:19] when we get our act together and we
[1:31:21] start doing good deeds and start
[1:31:26] no
[1:31:28] he has reconciled us in the body of his
[1:31:31] flesh through death.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; we were reconciled in Christ.
[1:31:37] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:31:39] unto himself. We were reconciled there
[1:31:41] in the body of his flesh. When that body
[1:31:44] died,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He died for me.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; When that blood was shed, that blood was
[1:31:51] shed for me. When that price was paid,
[1:31:54] when he was being beaten, he was being
[1:31:56] beaten for my crimes.
[1:31:59] When he was suffering, he was suffering
[1:32:01] in my place for my wrong deeds.
[1:32:05] and he worked in exchange. He took my
[1:32:08] sin upon him and he suffered the
[1:32:10] consequences of my sin so that he could
[1:32:13] put his righteousness on me so that I
[1:32:15] could suffer the consequences of his
[1:32:17] righteousness.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And he did that. He reconciled us in the
[1:32:21] body of his flesh to death so that he
[1:32:24] could present us present you holy and
[1:32:28] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:32:31] sight. You say, "How so, brother Chad?
[1:32:34] You don't know what I did yesterday. You
[1:32:35] don't know what I did this morning. I
[1:32:36] lost my temper. I did this. Listen,
[1:32:39] that's
[1:32:41] Have we been so far into this sermon,
[1:32:43] we've already missed it.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the family.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; He paid the price for the whole family.
[1:32:56] Now he's presenting me to the father
[1:32:58] holy and unblameable and unreprovable in
[1:33:03] his sight.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; How? Because somebody paid the price for
[1:33:08] me
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; by the shedding of blood. Amen. By by
[1:33:11] the covering of the blood, by the new
[1:33:12] birth. Now I get the benefit of his
[1:33:15] substitutionary offering. All my sins
[1:33:18] are under this substitutionary offering.
[1:33:21] So God doesn't account any of my sin to
[1:33:23] me as long as I stay under this
[1:33:25] headship. Amen. All my sins are paid
[1:33:27] for. And now I'm presented by my faith
[1:33:30] in him, holy, unblameable and
[1:33:32] unreprovable in his sight. Because of
[1:33:34] what he did, NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT I DO.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; He did it so he could present me holy
[1:33:42] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[1:33:43] sight. He did that so he could present
[1:33:45] to himself a church without spot or
[1:33:46] wrinkle. He did it so he could pay for
[1:33:49] our sins because of our fallen nature
[1:33:52] from our first father Adam. OUR FIRST
[1:33:54] BIG BROTHER FELL. WE ALL FELL. SO GOD
[1:33:57] BROUGHT US ANOTHER FIRSTBORN among many
[1:33:59] brethren, another big brother so that
[1:34:01] when he rose, we can rise with him.
[1:34:05] [Music]
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; No matter how many times we preach this
[1:34:08] and no matter how many times we go over
[1:34:10] it, THERE'S ALWAYS, "BUT I DID THIS, BUT
[1:34:12] I DID THAT." AMEN. LISTEN, YOU GOT TO
[1:34:15] STOP LOOKING AT ADAM AND START LOOKING
[1:34:17] AT CHRIST AND SAY, "I WAS I WAS
[1:34:19] RECONCILED IN THE BODY OF HIS FLESH. ALL
[1:34:22] MY CRIMES, ALL MY SINS, AND EVERYTHING
[1:34:24] I'LL EVER DO WAS PAID FOR IN THAT
[1:34:26] SUBSTITUTIONARY OFFERING. AND BECAUSE OF
[1:34:28] THAT, MY FAITH IN THAT, GOD HAS IMPUTED
[1:34:31] UNTO ME HIS OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND NOW
[1:34:33] I'M JUST AS RIGHTEOUS AS CHRIST IS
[1:34:36] RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE HE PAID THE PRICE FOR
[1:34:38] ME. GOD CAN'T EXTRACT IT FROM ME BECAUSE
[1:34:41] HE EXTRACTED IT FROM JESUS CHRIST. HE
[1:34:44] CAN'T MAKE ME PAY. THERE'S NO DOUBLE
[1:34:46] JEOPARDY. IT WAS PAID FOR AT CALVARY.
[1:34:48] GOD'S NOT DOING A DOUBLE PUNISHMENT.
[1:34:50] THERE WAS ONE PRICE PAID FOR SIN ONCE
[1:34:53] AND FOR ALL.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; AND IF I'M UNDER THAT HEADSHIP, ALL MY
[1:34:58] SIN WAS PAID FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL.
[1:35:04] AND UNDER THAT HEADSHIP, I'm declared
[1:35:06] righteous.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Because of his righteousness,
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; not mine.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's why he become the interceder to
[1:35:16] intercede through the church ages. What
[1:35:18] was he interceding for? HE WAS
[1:35:20] INTERCEDING FOR HIS BRETHREN. He was
[1:35:22] standing IN THE GAP. HE WAS THE BIG
[1:35:23] BROTHER. HE WAS THE LAST ADAM. HE HE WAS
[1:35:26] THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD. HE
[1:35:28] WAS THE HEAD OF IT ALL. STANDING THERE
[1:35:30] TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE
[1:35:32] FAMILY SAYING FATHER FORGIVE THEM THEY
[1:35:34] DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FATHER FORGIVE
[1:35:35] THEM FATHER FORGIVE THEM FATHER FORGIVE
[1:35:37] THEM WHAT WAS HE DOING HE WAS AT THE
[1:35:40] PLACE OF JUDGMENT BUT HE HIMSELF WAS
[1:35:43] BEING ABLE TO EXTEND MERCY AMEN AND
[1:35:45] FORGIVENESS BECAUSE THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB
[1:35:48] THE ONE THAT PAID THE PRICE WAS STANDING
[1:35:50] THERE INTERCEDING FOR HIS brethren
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; the head OF THE FAMILY LIKE JOB HEAD OF
[1:35:56] THE FAMILY PAID THE PRICE FOR his
[1:35:57] children Jesus Christ the head of The
[1:35:59] family paid the price for his brethren,
[1:36:01] FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD, AND HE'S BEEN
[1:36:03] STANDING THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES. AMEN.
[1:36:05] AN INTERCESSION. AMEN. DECLARING,
[1:36:07] "FATHER, forgive them."
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; And brother BAM DRAMATIZED. HE SAYS HE
[1:36:12] LOOKS to him. Amen. The bloody lamb, THE
[1:36:14] HIGH PRIEST WITH THE BLOOD, AND HE
[1:36:16] FORGIVES US.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; NOT BASED OFF OUR MERIT, NOT BASED OFF
[1:36:22] OUR CONDUCT, BUT BASED OFF OUR FAITH IN
[1:36:24] THE SUBSTITUTIONARY OFFERING.
[1:36:30] But I know I'll have a conversation with
[1:36:33] somebody months from now. But I but how
[1:36:36] could he I still have this problem in my
[1:36:38] life. It's like
[1:36:41] please
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; look to your big brother.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Look to God the beginning of the
[1:36:47] creation. Look to the chief captain.
[1:36:49] Look to the captain of the host. Look to
[1:36:51] the one
[1:36:53] who took our place. Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Look to the headship. What name were you
[1:36:58] baptized?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; You're not baptized in titles.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Although God has titles. So God
[1:37:09] works with man in different modes of
[1:37:11] operation. And all that's an expla
[1:37:12] explanation of how God is working with
[1:37:14] man. But when God came to pay the price,
[1:37:16] he had to become a man.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; A man. The man.
[1:37:22] And when he became the man, the head of
[1:37:24] the family, he took a name and that name
[1:37:26] was Jesus. Amen. And now in the name of
[1:37:29] Jesus Christ, I am redeemed. In the name
[1:37:31] of Jesus Christ, I am saved. In the name
[1:37:34] of Jesus Christ, I'm declared fallless.
[1:37:36] In the name OF JESUS CHRIST, I AM
[1:37:38] DELIVERED. In the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:37:39] I AM SET FREE. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S ALL in
[1:37:42] that name. BECAUSE IT WAS ALL IN THAT
[1:37:45] MAN.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz it HAD TO BE A MAN. A MAN LOST IT. A
[1:37:50] MAN HAS TO REDEEM IT.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY TITLES WON'T WORK FOR
[1:37:56] BAPTISM. IT HAS TO BE THE NAME OF THE
[1:37:59] MAN WHO PAID THE PRICE FOR THE FAMILY OF
[1:38:01] GOD. AND THAT MAN WAS Jesus Christ.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY BAPTISM HAS TO BE IN THE name
[1:38:07] of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, DECLARING WHO
[1:38:10] IT WAS. WHO'S THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY?
[1:38:12] WHO'S GOING TO BE KING OF KINGS and lord
[1:38:14] of lords and RULE OVER THE EARTH?
[1:38:16] BECAUSE THE BATTLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR
[1:38:17] WHO'S GOING TO RULE THE EARTH. WHAT DID
[1:38:19] ADAM LEAVE? THE RIGHT TO RULE THE EARTH.
[1:38:21] WHAT DID JESUS CHRIST BUY BACK? THE
[1:38:23] RIGHT TO RULE THE EARTH.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; And he redeemed it all.
[1:38:31] Romans 8, he says, "And if children
[1:38:35] for children, then heirs,
[1:38:37] heirs of God and joint hes."
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; I like this word, too.
[1:38:47] There's a lot of words that I like.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Joint hes.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That means I'm a co-air.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; With Christ,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; that means I get the benefit of all he
[1:38:59] did.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; If so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:39:05] may be also glorified together. That
[1:39:07] means I have to stay under his headship.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I have to stay under his lordship, under
[1:39:11] his rulership, under his headship.
[1:39:14] But I'm an heir of God because I'm a
[1:39:16] child of God because he that is
[1:39:18] sanctified and he that is sanctified are
[1:39:20] all of the same.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; I'm an heir of God and a joint heir with
[1:39:26] Christ.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; What did Christ buy back?
[1:39:32] Everything that was lost.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; So what do I get in him?
[1:39:39] Everything that was lost
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; in him. He bought it back. I didn't have
[1:39:44] to buy it back. I couldn't buy it back.
[1:39:47] He bought it back. But because I'm in
[1:39:49] him,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; because I'm under his headship and part
[1:39:52] of him, when he bought it back, he
[1:39:53] bought it back for me, too.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to Revelation chapter 5.
[1:40:05] I love so much. I was in the back just
[1:40:08] meditating on how blessed we are as a
[1:40:10] people.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother said, at the opening
[1:40:12] of the seals, the veil came off the
[1:40:14] Bible.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; We begin to understand all of these
[1:40:18] things that we're preaching today and
[1:40:20] the depth that we're understanding them.
[1:40:21] Amen. It's not like we didn't know Jesus
[1:40:23] Christ, Amen, was the first begotten. We
[1:40:26] It wasn't that we didn't know that he
[1:40:27] paid the price, but we didn't understand
[1:40:29] what redemption was all about. We didn't
[1:40:31] know what we fell from and what we were
[1:40:32] going back to. We didn't know what the
[1:40:34] fall was all about. We didn't know what
[1:40:35] redemption was all about. All of
[1:40:37] denomination is trying to get people
[1:40:39] saved so they don't go to hell and they
[1:40:40] go to heaven. That has nothing to DO
[1:40:42] WITH REDEMPTION.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; THAT has nothing to zero. Zilt. If you
[1:40:47] still think getting saved is so you
[1:40:49] don't go to hell, but you go to heaven.
[1:40:50] You have no idea what redemption is
[1:40:53] about. And you have no idea what this
[1:40:55] Bible is about.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with redemption.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; HELL WAS NOT EVEN CREATED for man. Hell
[1:41:04] was created for the devil and his
[1:41:05] angels.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; There will be some men who wind up
[1:41:09] there. There'll be some souls who wind
[1:41:11] up there because they refuse the light
[1:41:13] of God's word. Amen. Whenever they come
[1:41:15] face to face with it. But it was not
[1:41:16] CREATED FOR MAN. GOD didn't create that
[1:41:19] for man. God created the earth for man.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED THE EARTH and all that is on
[1:41:26] the earth. AND HE FORMED IT ALL. AMEN.
[1:41:28] TO BE the habitation and dominion and
[1:41:31] rulership of man. And man was GOING TO
[1:41:34] BE GOD'S ATTRIBUTES, HIS FAMILY,
[1:41:37] HIMSELF, MANIFEST IN BODIES OF FLESH
[1:41:40] UPON THIS EARTH AS A FAMILY OF GOD IN
[1:41:42] FELLOWSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER ON THE
[1:41:44] EARTH. THAT'S WHY THE COMMISSION WAS
[1:41:46] GIVEN TO ADAM. THAT'S WHY ADAM WOULD
[1:41:47] HAVE BROUGHT FORTH CHRIST, THE ENTIRE
[1:41:50] RACE OF CHRIST, THE ENTIRE SEED LINE,
[1:41:52] THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; What book? THE BOOK THAT ADAM LOST. WHAT
[1:42:00] WAS THAT BOOK? THAT WAS THAT WAS THE
[1:42:02] book
[1:42:04] of Christ.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; The lineage of Christ, the seed line of
[1:42:09] Christ. Adam would have brought forth
[1:42:12] all of Christ.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:17] Lord,
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; that means I would have been included
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; because I'm part of Christ, the anointed
[1:42:22] word.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; But Adam failed. That's why serpent seed
[1:42:28] is such an important doctrine. is not a
[1:42:30] teaching, friend. That's why, listen,
[1:42:31] we're not coming back to I know
[1:42:32] something the Baptists don't know.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; My has nothing to do with that. I DON'T
[1:42:37] EVEN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WAS A VIRGIN
[1:42:38] birth without serpent seat. I don't
[1:42:40] UNDERSTAND WHAT I FELL FROM. I DON'T
[1:42:41] EVEN UNDERSTAND THE BODY I LIVE IN. I
[1:42:43] DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I LOVE GOD WITH ALL
[1:42:44] MY HEART AND I'M STILL TEMPTED WITH THIS
[1:42:46] OUTSIDE MAN IF I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[1:42:47] SERPENT SEED.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; We have NO UNDERSTANDING AND NO
[1:42:52] UNDERSTANDING OF REDEMPTION. AND
[1:42:53] DENOMINATIONS ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE
[1:42:55] SAVED to go to heaven. LISTEN, HEAVEN IS
[1:42:57] NOT MY DESTINATION. MY DESTINATION IS A
[1:43:00] JOINT HEIR WITH CHRIST WHEN CHRIST HAS
[1:43:02] GIVEN BACK EVERYTHING ADAM LOST ON THIS
[1:43:05] EARTH.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY DESTINATION is here in the new
[1:43:11] heavens IN THE NEW EARTH. AMEN. RULING
[1:43:13] AND REIGNING WITH CHRIST FIRST FOR A
[1:43:15] THOUSAND YEARS IN A HONEYMOON PERIOD.
[1:43:17] THEN A FINAL BURNING OFF OF EVERYTHING
[1:43:19] THAT'S UNGODLY AND A RESTORATION. AMEN.
[1:43:21] of heaven and earth united together as
[1:43:24] one. When the new heavens descend out of
[1:43:26] heaven, amen, as a bride adorned for her
[1:43:29] groom.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT? IT'S THE BARRIER THAT
[1:43:32] SEPARATES. HEAVEN AND EARTH IS REMOVED.
[1:43:34] SOMEHOW IT'S REMOVED. AND THE TWO REALMS
[1:43:37] UNITE INTO ONE. AND HEAVEN AND earth
[1:43:39] become one thing upon this earth. And
[1:43:41] Jesus Christ is lord of lords, KING OF
[1:43:43] KINGS. HE'S ALL IN ALL AND WE ARE WITH
[1:43:46] HIM.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; That's redemption.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT THIS STORY IS ALL
[1:43:52] ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING SOMEBODY
[1:43:54] SAVED SO THEY DON'T GO TO HELL AND THEY
[1:43:56] GO TO HEAVEN,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; That's not That's
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, there is nothing outside
[1:44:08] this message.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; That'll bring life.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; NOTHING.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BEING TAUGHT TO
[1:44:14] PEOPLE. I NEED TO BELIEVE IN JESUS so I
[1:44:16] don't go to hell, so I go to heaven.
[1:44:18] THAT'S LISTEN THAT'S NOT WHY EVEN JESUS
[1:44:20] CAME. HE CAME TO REDEEM ALL THAT WAS
[1:44:23] LOST.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; That's why he CAME FOR HIS LOST SHEEP.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I didn't come to save the
[1:44:31] whole world. I CAME FOR MINE THAT WERE
[1:44:32] IN THE WORLD."
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; But in order to get HIS THAT WERE IN THE
[1:44:37] WORLD, HE PAID THE PRICE FOR THE WHOLE
[1:44:39] WORLD.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE BOUGHT BACK EVERYTHING ADAM
[1:44:43] LOST BECAUSE HE WANTED THE PEARL of
[1:44:44] great price. THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE
[1:44:46] WAS HIS TREASURE. WAS HIS BRIDE. IN
[1:44:48] ORDER TO GET THE TREASURE, HE BOUGHT THE
[1:44:50] WHOLE FIELD. HE BOUGHT THE WHOLE EARTH
[1:44:52] BY THE SHEDDING OF HIS BLOOD. HE BOUGHT
[1:44:53] IT ALL. AND NOW, BECAUSE HE'S THE OWNER
[1:44:55] OF IT ALL BY SHEDDING HIS OWN BLOOD FOR
[1:44:57] IT ALL, NOW HE SETS AS A KING, AS A
[1:45:00] JUDGE OVER ALL THE EARTH. AND NOW he has
[1:45:02] the right to determine who he can extend
[1:45:04] mercy TO AND WHO NOT. THE WHITE THRONE
[1:45:06] JUDGMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
[1:45:08] ELECT OF GOD. THE WHITE THRONE judgment
[1:45:10] has nothing to do with THE BRIDE OF
[1:45:11] CHRIST. THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT.
[1:45:13] LISTEN,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT IS WHERE KING
[1:45:18] AND QUEEN CHRIST AND HIS BRIDE, THE
[1:45:19] PREDESTINATED SIEGING OF GOD, SIT AND
[1:45:22] JUDGE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE EARTH. AND
[1:45:24] BECAUSE HE PAID THE PRICE TO GET HER, HE
[1:45:26] BOUGHT IT ALL. NOW, HE'S GOING TO EXTEND
[1:45:28] MERCY TO THOSE who can receive mercy.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE, WE DON'T KNOW THE
[1:45:34] BIBLE. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY
[1:45:36] BIBLE VERSES you memorize. Amen. You and
[1:45:38] I did NOT KNOW THIS BIBLE. I READ IT
[1:45:41] FROM THE TIME I WAS A CHILD. I WAS
[1:45:43] FASCINATED WITH IT. I LOVED IT. AMEN.
[1:45:45] BUT TILL I COME TO THIS MESSAGE, I
[1:45:47] DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. AND
[1:45:49] I'LL TELL YOU THIS, I DIDN'T KNOW
[1:45:50] NOTHING EVEN 5 years ago LIKE I KNOW
[1:45:53] NOW. And today is better than yesterday.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Because he's continually unveiling
[1:45:58] himself.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY STOPPING BACK AT A
[1:46:01] DENOMINATION AND ALL I NEED IS TO
[1:46:03] BELIEVE JESUS DIED AND I COULD GO TO
[1:46:04] HEAVEN. LISTEN, WE'RE WE'RE MISSING THE
[1:46:06] WHOLE POINT OF WHAT GOD'S BEEN DOING.
[1:46:09] AMEN.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
[1:46:12] THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE CAME. IT DIDN'T
[1:46:14] COME SO WE COULD SAY, "WE GOT A PROPHET.
[1:46:16] WE GOT A PROPHET. WE KNOW MORE THAN
[1:46:17] YOU." IT'S SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY
[1:46:19] COME INTO REDEMPTION TO COME BACK TO
[1:46:21] WHAT WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And if we SEE THE MESSAGE AS WELL, MAYBE
[1:46:26] THEY'RE OVERPROMOTING A MAN and then
[1:46:28] brother Benham and then they GOT SOME
[1:46:30] WEIRD IDEA. LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE A
[1:46:31] CLUE WHAT THE MESSAGE IS ABOUT IF THAT'S
[1:46:33] YOUR THINKING.
[1:46:35] The message was TO BRING THE FINAL FINAL
[1:46:38] BIT OF REDEMPTION BACK TO THE SEED OF
[1:46:40] GOD, BACK TO THE RACE THAT WAS LOST WHEN
[1:46:42] Adam fell.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOTHING TO PREACH BUT
[1:46:47] this message.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; DENOMINATIONAL DOCTRINE WON'T DO anybody
[1:46:51] any good.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that there won't be
[1:46:54] those who receive mercy at the white
[1:46:56] throne judgment because of their respect
[1:46:58] FOR THE WORD OF GOD. IT WILL. SO IN THAT
[1:46:59] FACET, IT'LL DO GOOD, BUT NOT FOR
[1:47:02] REDEMPTION.
[1:47:03] Cuz redemption is for the fallen
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; seed of God.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. THAT'S WHY I'LL ONLY PREACH THIS
[1:47:12] MESSAGE.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not GOING TO GO BACK TO PREACHING
[1:47:14] LIKE THE DENOMINATION. SOMETIMES PEOPLE
[1:47:16] SAY, "ALL I WANT IS A SIMPLE GOSPEL
[1:47:18] MESSAGE." I'M GIVING YOU THE GOSPEL
[1:47:20] MESSAGE TODAY. CAN IT BE ANY MORE SIMPLE
[1:47:22] THAN THAT?
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; This is what THE MESSAGE IS UNVEILED.
[1:47:25] WHAT IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT. THAT'S WHY
[1:47:27] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID AT the opening of
[1:47:28] the seals, THE VEIL CAME OFF OF MY
[1:47:31] BIBLE. IT BECAME A NEW BIBLE.
[1:47:34] [Applause]
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; GOD, HELP ME TO ONLY PREACH THIS
[1:47:38] MESSAGE.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; It's what has life. It's what brings
[1:47:44] life. It is Christ.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; It is the headship restored back to us.
[1:47:50] It is the head of the family that's come
[1:47:51] in our midst. It is the bridegroom who's
[1:47:53] wanting to marry us. You say, "Well, I
[1:47:55] thought he was my brother." Don't forget
[1:47:57] the woman was Adam's sister.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Be great.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And Sarah happened to be Abraham's
[1:48:03] sister, too.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; So, I can marry my brother,
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; and my brother is Christ.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen, friends.
[1:48:15] Now, let's go. Let's finish up here
[1:48:19] in
[1:48:21] Revelation chapter 5.
[1:48:27] Revelation 5.
[1:48:34] Revelation 5:5. And hope maketh not
[1:48:37] ashamed.
[1:48:38] I'm sorry. I'm in Romans 5. Revelations
[1:48:41] 5. Just because it starts with an R
[1:48:43] doesn't mean you're in the right book.
[1:48:46] I need to pay closer attention.
[1:48:49] Revelation 5:5.
[1:48:53] No, I'm going to go to 51.
[1:48:57] And I saw on the right hand of him that
[1:48:58] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:49:02] and on the backside seal the seven
[1:49:04] seals.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And I saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[1:49:08] loud voice, who is worthy to open the
[1:49:10] book and to loose the seals thereof.
[1:49:14] And no man,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; what word was that?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; What are they looking for?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; It didn't say person. didn't say being.
[1:49:27] It didn't say creature.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; And no man in heaven nor in earth,
[1:49:33] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:49:35] the book, neither to look thereon.
[1:49:39] And I wept much because no man was found
[1:49:41] worthy to open and to read the book,
[1:49:44] neither to look thereon.
[1:49:46] We've been through this, but I'd like
[1:49:47] just to slow down for a minute and take
[1:49:49] a look at this. This is such an
[1:49:52] important passage of scripture.
[1:49:55] Amen.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; This is all the host of heaven. This is
[1:49:58] taking place in the end time in the
[1:50:00] heavenly realm at the throne of God.
[1:50:02] This isn't a trivial thing.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And just because we read over something
[1:50:06] and don't understand it doesn't mean we
[1:50:07] should throw it in the trash can as
[1:50:09] unimportant. Listen, this this is a cry
[1:50:12] that's going out in all of heaven that
[1:50:15] affects the heaven, the earth, and
[1:50:17] everything under the earth. Amen.
[1:50:18] Because there's a book in the right hand
[1:50:20] of him that sit on the throne. And
[1:50:22] that's God Almighty.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; And he's got a book in his hand and a
[1:50:26] strong angel proclaims with a loud
[1:50:28] voice, "Who
[1:50:30] wants to come and take the book?"
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; No. Because a lot of people wanted to
[1:50:34] come and take the book.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Who is worthy?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, remember when brother Jason was
[1:50:41] preaching here last week, there was some
[1:50:43] things he was getting into and I was in
[1:50:44] my seat saying, "God, make him stop.
[1:50:46] Make him stop. Make him stop." And I'm
[1:50:49] glad God honored my prayers. I had to
[1:50:51] apologize to him afterwards. Brother, I
[1:50:53] said if you felt the pull stop, that was
[1:50:54] me.
[1:50:56] It was a full stop and it pushing back
[1:50:59] it. But oh, I was so blessed when I
[1:51:02] heard it. Hey, who is worthy to take the
[1:51:05] book? And there goes a search and no man
[1:51:07] in heaven
[1:51:09] nor in earth, neither under the earth,
[1:51:12] was able to open the book. Listen, if
[1:51:15] God's whole purpose was just to get you
[1:51:16] saved to go to heaven, there was already
[1:51:18] men in heaven. But still, there was a
[1:51:19] problem.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] That's right.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; there was still a problem.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Redemption wasn't finished.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; And there was men in heaven.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; So if God's destination for you is
[1:51:33] heaven, then what's the point of
[1:51:34] Revelation chapter 5?
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
[1:51:43] under the earth, was able to open the
[1:51:46] book,
[1:51:48] neither to look thereon.
[1:51:51] They weren't even able to look at it.
[1:51:53] Nobody had this worthiness. And we know
[1:51:55] that the lamb is the worthy one. And it
[1:51:59] says, "And I wept much because no man
[1:52:02] was found worthy to open and read the
[1:52:03] book, neither to look thereon." And
[1:52:06] brother Bram says this in the sixth
[1:52:07] seal.
[1:52:09] That's the reason John wept. Because if
[1:52:12] no one could get the book, all creation,
[1:52:16] everything was gone.
[1:52:19] What is this book? It's the book that
[1:52:22] Adam lost. It was right to dominion and
[1:52:24] rulership over the earth. The earth was
[1:52:26] given as an inheritance to man. And man
[1:52:30] lost it. And God wants to give it back
[1:52:32] to man. But what man?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; God man.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; His family, his race, his attributes
[1:52:40] that have come into the flesh. No one
[1:52:42] could get that book. All cre, if no one
[1:52:45] could get the book, all creation,
[1:52:47] everything was gone. She just simply
[1:52:49] turned back to atoms and molecules and
[1:52:51] so forth and cosmic light and not even
[1:52:53] be creation person, nothing else. Cuz
[1:52:55] Adam lost the rights of that book. He
[1:52:57] forfeited it when he listened to his
[1:52:58] wife and she listened to Satan's
[1:53:00] reasoning instead of God's word.
[1:53:04] Oh man, that's so good. Friends,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; John standing here,
[1:53:10] John has witnessed the life of Jesus
[1:53:13] Christ. He witnessed the crucifixion of
[1:53:15] Jesus Christ. He saw Christ after he
[1:53:18] resurrected. John was the first one
[1:53:21] actually to look into the tomb at
[1:53:22] Jesus's resurrection.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; He made the he looked in and he saw the
[1:53:26] napkin and he saw the things folded up.
[1:53:28] But he waited and Peter was the first to
[1:53:29] go in and then John went in and it said
[1:53:31] when John went in, he looked and he
[1:53:34] believed. Who was the first person to
[1:53:36] believe in the resurrection? John.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; John believed in Jesus. And he was
[1:53:42] actually the one, Amen, that really
[1:53:44] didn't really forsake Jesus all that
[1:53:45] much because he was the one that
[1:53:47] followed him into the judgment. He's the
[1:53:48] one that got Peter into the judgment.
[1:53:50] John was super close to Jesus.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; John saw his death. John was a witness
[1:53:56] of the resurrection. He saw him and
[1:53:58] talked to him after his resurrection.
[1:54:00] Amen. He was at the day of Pentecost and
[1:54:03] he received the baptism of the Holy
[1:54:04] Ghost. God had wrought many miracles and
[1:54:06] signs and wonders by his hand. He had
[1:54:08] been imprisoned and led out and all this
[1:54:10] other stuff that had happened to him.
[1:54:11] But now at the end of his life, Amen, he
[1:54:14] sees a book in the right hand of him
[1:54:15] that sits on the throne. Amen. And
[1:54:17] nobody was able to look at it. Nobody
[1:54:18] was able to touch it. Nobody was able to
[1:54:20] loose the seals. And he begins to weep
[1:54:22] much. And brother Ram says he was
[1:54:24] weeping because he knew if nobody could
[1:54:25] TAKE THAT BOOK, ALL creation was lost.
[1:54:28] But listen, listen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; JOHN WASN'T LOST.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS SAVED.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; JOHN WAS BORN AGAIN. JOHN HAD THE
[1:54:37] GENUINE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. JOHN,
[1:54:39] LISTEN, JOHN WAS AN APOSTLE. JOHN WAS A
[1:54:42] DISCIPLE. JOHN WAS A WITNESS OF THE
[1:54:43] RESURRECTION. JOHN'S SALVATION WAS
[1:54:45] SECURE. JOHN WAS NOT GOING TO DIE. JOHN
[1:54:48] WAS HEAVENBOUND.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S SAVED. HE'S REDEEMED. HE'S BORN
[1:54:54] AGAIN. HE'S WASHED FROM HIS SINS. HE'S
[1:54:57] RESTORED IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD. HE'S
[1:54:59] GOT ALL OF THIS GOING FOR HIM. AND WHEN
[1:55:01] HE SEES THAT NOBODY CAN TAKE THE BOOK,
[1:55:03] THIS MAN WHO'S SAVED AND GOING TO HEAVEN
[1:55:05] IS WEEPING WITH ALL OF HIS MIGHT BECAUSE
[1:55:07] HE KNOWS UNLESS SOMEBODY TAKES THAT ALL
[1:55:09] IS LOST. WHAT'S LOST? YOU'RE NOT LOST,
[1:55:11] JOHN. YES. REDEMPTION IS LOST. THE
[1:55:14] PURPOSE OF CREATION IS LOST. THE PURPOSE
[1:55:16] OF THE GARDEN IS LOST. WHAT GOD HAD IN
[1:55:18] HIS MIND, IT'S ALL LOST IF NOBODY TAKES
[1:55:21] THAT BOOK.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU SEE THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:55:24] EVERYTHING. IT'S THE CAPPING OF THE
[1:55:26] GOSPEL. IT'S THE FULFILLING OF GOD'S
[1:55:28] PURPOSE. IT'S THE REVELATION OF WHAT
[1:55:30] IT'S ALL BEEN ABOUT.
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; JOHN SAVED. JOHN BORN AGAIN. JOHN FILLED
[1:55:38] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. JOHN WITH GIFTS
[1:55:40] OPERATING IN HIS LIFE. JOHN WHO'S SEEN
[1:55:42] IT ALL. JOHN WHO WROTE THE BIBLE. JOHN
[1:55:44] STANDING HERE WEEPING BECAUSE ALL IS
[1:55:46] LOST. HE'S NOT LOST. HIS SOUL IS NOT
[1:55:48] LOST. BUT THE INHERITANCE IS LOST.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:55] Oh friends,
[1:55:58] I hope you can see how powerful this
[1:55:59] message is. There is nothing that will
[1:56:01] give rapturing faith like this truth
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; cuz everybody else wants to be saved and
[1:56:07] go to heaven.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; But God's looking for a people who want
[1:56:11] his will, can catch his mind, that he
[1:56:14] can whisper love secrets in their ear, a
[1:56:16] little sweetheart he can tell what
[1:56:18] redemption's really all been about. And
[1:56:20] one WHO WILL GET EXCITED AND ONE WHO
[1:56:21] WILL WEEP WHEN IT'S NOT COMING. ONE WHO
[1:56:23] WILL BE THRILLED WHEN IT'S COMING. ONE
[1:56:24] WHO WILL BE LIKE JOHN, WHO'S A TYPE OF
[1:56:26] THE BRIDE, WILL SAY, "OH, NO. I'M SAVED.
[1:56:29] I'M GOING TO HEAVEN. I'M SECURE." BUT
[1:56:31] NO, THE PLAN OF GOD'S NOT FINISHED. IT
[1:56:33] CAN'T STOP LIKE THIS. REDEMPTION IS NOT
[1:56:35] OVER. JESUS DIED FOR MORE THAN THIS.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; HE DIED FOR ALL THAT ADAM LOST.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "And there's a price, and
[1:56:46] that's redemption. There's some price
[1:56:48] for redemption." And there was nobody
[1:56:50] could do it. So he he made his laws his
[1:56:53] own laws of a kinsman redeemer. Then
[1:56:55] they could find nobody. Every man was
[1:56:58] born of sex, born after sexual desire.
[1:57:00] He was in the original sin, Satan and
[1:57:02] Eve. So he could not do it. There's
[1:57:05] nothing in him. No holy pope, priest,
[1:57:07] doctor, divinity, or whoever he might
[1:57:09] be. He was nobody worthy. And he
[1:57:12] couldn't be an angel because it had to
[1:57:14] be a kinsman.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He had to be a man. THEN GOD HIMSELF
[1:57:19] BECAME A KINSMAN BY TAKING ON HUMAN
[1:57:21] FLESH THROUGH THE VIRGIN birth and he
[1:57:23] shed his blood.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What?
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; What What ARE THEY LOOKING FOR IN ROMAN
[1:57:30] REVELATION CHAPTER 5? AMEN. WHEN BROTHER
[1:57:33] BENHAM COMES IN REVELATION CHAPTER 5
[1:57:35] BACK IN 1960 and 61 when he's preaching
[1:57:38] on the revelation OF JESUS CHRIST, HE
[1:57:40] STARTS TO BRING IN the kinsman redeemer
[1:57:42] and he starts to bring IN RUTH AND BOAZ.
[1:57:44] AND HE STARTS TO SHOW THAT REVELATION
[1:57:46] FIVE IS BOAZ AT THE GATE. BOAZ PAID THE
[1:57:49] PRICE OF REDEMPTION. BOAZ WAS REDEEMING
[1:57:51] BACK ALL THAT WAS LOST, GETTING THE
[1:57:54] WHOLE INHERITANCE.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. THAT'S
[1:57:58] WHAT REVELATION CHAPTER 5 IS ALL ABOUT.
[1:58:00] REVELATION CHAPTER 5 IS, IS THERE A MAN?
[1:58:03] IS THERE A KINSMAN REDEEMER? IT HAS TO
[1:58:06] BE A MAN, NOT AN ANGEL. A MAN, NOT A
[1:58:08] CHERUB. A MAN, NOT A CREATURE, A MAN,
[1:58:10] NOT A SHEEP, A MAN, NOT A GOAT. THERE'S
[1:58:12] GOT TO BE A MAN WHO'S A KINSMAN WHO CAN
[1:58:15] PLAY THE PART OF REDEEMER, WHICH MEANS
[1:58:17] HE HAS TO BE WORTHY AND HE HAS to be
[1:58:20] able.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE MAN THAT WAS
[1:58:24] WORTHY AND ABLE AND THAT'S THE MAN
[1:58:26] CHRIST JESUS.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:32] In this kinsman redeemer role,
[1:58:36] somebody has to step forward who's
[1:58:38] worthy. Somebody who's able, somebody
[1:58:40] who's a near kinsman.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And the near kinsman has to be willing
[1:58:46] to pay the price of redemption.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; And when he pays the price of
[1:58:51] redemption, then he can take back all
[1:58:53] that was lost.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; This is Revelation chapter 5 is a legal
[1:58:58] proceeding, friends. That's right.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; It's a courtroom.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; It's a courtroom. It's a legal
[1:59:04] proceeding. And there's a declaration
[1:59:07] and the judge on the bench is holding
[1:59:08] the book. But listen, that's not his
[1:59:11] book.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; He gave it to Adam. He gave it to his
[1:59:16] son. He wants his son to have it.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; He's just holding it until the last Adam
[1:59:21] can take it.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; He's holding it secure, keeping it from
[1:59:26] the squatter so he has no squatters
[1:59:28] rights so he can't manipulate it. And
[1:59:29] he's holding in his hand, waiting for
[1:59:31] the one who can come and take it. It's a
[1:59:34] court proceeding. And the strong angel
[1:59:36] is calling for the one who meets all the
[1:59:38] requirements and can take the book.
[1:59:40] Amen. And John, when he finds that
[1:59:41] there's no one in heaven or earth or
[1:59:43] under the earth, he starts weeping
[1:59:45] because he knows all is lost. Oh, I get
[1:59:48] so excited when I read all of this. God
[1:59:51] is so good. Let's go down to verse 5.
[1:59:55] And one of the elders saith unto me,
[1:59:57] weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe
[2:00:00] of Judah, the root of David hath
[2:00:03] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[2:00:06] the seven seals. I want you to look at
[2:00:08] these titles, friends. Look, look. Judah
[2:00:11] was the king tribe where the governor
[2:00:13] and the king was going to come from.
[2:00:14] It's prophesied.
[2:00:16] David, Amen, was the king after God's
[2:00:18] own heart. And he was given a promise
[2:00:19] that thy seed shall rule forever. So
[2:00:22] there has to be a seed of David. Amen.
[2:00:24] And there has to be the head of Judah
[2:00:27] who's the governor. Who's the seed of
[2:00:29] David? Listen, this is not calling for
[2:00:32] an angel. This is about an earthly
[2:00:34] inheritance. This has to be a man who
[2:00:37] can fulfill these requirements.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; And he is the lion of the tribe of
[2:00:42] Judah, the root of David. And he hath
[2:00:45] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[2:00:48] the seven seals thereof. And I beheld,
[2:00:50] and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[2:00:52] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[2:00:54] the elders stood a lamb, as it had been
[2:00:56] slain, having seven horns, and seven
[2:00:58] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[2:01:00] God, sent forth unto all the earth.
[2:01:02] Amen. When he hears a lion's coming, and
[2:01:04] he hears the root of David's coming,
[2:01:06] offspring of David, he looks and what he
[2:01:09] sees is a bleeding, bruised, beaten
[2:01:11] lamb, because why? He has to show that
[2:01:14] he's worthy to take the book. AMEN. ALL
[2:01:17] OF THIS IS SYMBOLOGY. THE WHOLE BOOK IS
[2:01:19] SYMBOL. BROTHER SAID BOOK OF REVELATION
[2:01:21] is a book of symbols. Amen. He's not an
[2:01:24] animal standing there. But what we see
[2:01:26] in the scripture is the description of
[2:01:28] the one who's worthy. And the one who's
[2:01:30] worthy is the one who became the
[2:01:32] sacrifice. The one who paid the price of
[2:01:34] the penalty. The beaten, bruised,
[2:01:37] bloody. It wasn't a lamb standing there.
[2:01:38] It was a lamb cut to ribbons and bruised
[2:01:40] and battered and bleeding all over. He
[2:01:42] was standing there. WHAT WAS HE SHOWING?
[2:01:44] I'M WORTHY. I PAID THE PRICE. I PAID FOR
[2:01:47] REDEMPTION. I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR THIS
[2:01:50] BOOK.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH,
[2:01:53] THE KING TRIBE. HE WAS THE ROOT AND
[2:01:55] OFFSPRING OF DAVID. AND HE WAS THE LAMB
[2:01:57] OF GOD that made him worthy by paying
[2:01:59] the price.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; This is a courtroom proceeding.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; He meets all the qualifications.
[2:02:08] Verse seven.
[2:02:10] and he came and took the book out of the
[2:02:14] right hand of him that sat upon the
[2:02:16] throne.
[2:02:17] That book had been lost for thousands of
[2:02:21] years since Adam lost it in the Garden
[2:02:23] of Eden.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, Adam wasn't walking around with
[2:02:27] a book under his arm.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; It was the inheritance of the earth. It
[2:02:32] was the right to rule and bring forth
[2:02:34] the family of God
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; that was lost.
[2:02:38] And he come the last Adam,
[2:02:42] the first begotten, the head of the
[2:02:45] family.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He came
[2:02:49] and he took the book out of the right
[2:02:51] hand of him that sat upon the throne.
[2:02:54] You realize why the lamb had to come
[2:02:56] forth? Why the man? Behold the man.
[2:03:01] Behold the man who bled and died. Behold
[2:03:04] the man who was no fault. Behold the
[2:03:07] man. That's why the whole drama plays
[2:03:09] out that he goes to the one who sits on
[2:03:10] the throne and takes it out of his hand
[2:03:12] because God, Amen. God is an eternal
[2:03:15] spirit. He's holding the book waiting
[2:03:17] for a man that can take back what he had
[2:03:19] given to man. And when no man was
[2:03:21] worthy, God says, "Well, I'll make my
[2:03:23] own man and I'll become my own man and
[2:03:25] I'll come and become my own son to pay
[2:03:27] it back." AND SO NOW THAT SON COMES TO
[2:03:29] THE ETERNAL FATHER, AMEN, TO TAKE BACK
[2:03:30] THE BOOK. LISTEN, this is not happening
[2:03:33] in reality as a lamb going up THERE AND
[2:03:35] BITING IT OR STICKING his hooves
[2:03:37] together and trying to NO, THIS IS ALL
[2:03:39] SYMBOLOGY SHOWING US WHAT'S TAKING PLACE
[2:03:41] in the heavenly realm.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And he's taking back the right to rule.
[2:03:46] He's taking back the inheritance of the
[2:03:48] earth. And he's taking back the family
[2:03:50] of God, the right to bring forth the
[2:03:52] family of God.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Bam says, notice he's
[2:03:59] not an animal. He's talking about what
[2:04:01] we just read. He took the book out of
[2:04:03] the right hand of him that sat upon the
[2:04:04] throne. Who was it? The owner, the
[2:04:06] original owner that had the book of
[2:04:08] redemption in his right hand. And no
[2:04:10] angel, no angelic being, nothing else
[2:04:13] could take the place. And this bloody
[2:04:15] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[2:04:17] his hand. What was it, brother? This is
[2:04:20] the most sublime thing in the scripture.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Did the prophet say that? Amen.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; A act that not an angel, not nothing
[2:04:31] could do it. And the lamb come and took
[2:04:33] it from the right hand of him that sat
[2:04:35] upon the throne. What is it now? It
[2:04:37] belongs to the lamb.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Adam lost it. But the lamb now has taken
[2:04:43] it back.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; When brother says this is the most
[2:04:47] sublime thing in the scripture, that
[2:04:50] statement is a startling statement. That
[2:04:54] means in all the scripture, brother
[2:04:56] Brandon said this is the most sublime
[2:04:59] thing in the scripture.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't say Calvary was
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Now, no doubt Calvary was a sublime
[2:05:09] thing,
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; a wonderful thing, but he said this is
[2:05:13] the most sublime.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; And when we say statements like that, it
[2:05:17] can make people nervous if somehow we're
[2:05:19] downplaying Calvary. But remember, John
[2:05:22] had already been through the Calvary
[2:05:23] experience and been born again and he's
[2:05:25] still weeping.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Showing Calvary was for a purpose. And
[2:05:30] if you don't fulfill the purpose of
[2:05:32] Calvary, THEN ALL IS LOST. AMEN. AMEN.
[2:05:35] So what becomes more important? And I
[2:05:37] don't mean to downplay. So please just
[2:05:39] listen to me. What becomes more in
[2:05:40] purpose? Amen. What might becomes more
[2:05:42] important? The act or the purpose of the
[2:05:45] act or the thing the act was for? Amen.
[2:05:47] And Calvary was for a purpose. making
[2:05:50] the purpose more valuable than Calvary.
[2:05:52] He was willing to give his LIFE AND SHED
[2:05:54] HIS BLOOD FOR THIS PURPOSE. MAKING THIS
[2:05:57] PURPOSE when he comes and takes the
[2:05:59] purpose. Amen. Fulfilling the reason he
[2:06:01] went to Calvary. The reason he came
[2:06:03] flesh the reason he went to Calvary. The
[2:06:05] reason he paid THE PRICE, IT WAS ALL SO
[2:06:08] THAT HE COULD TAKE THE BOOK AND BRING
[2:06:10] BACK EVERYTHING THAT ADAM LOST. AND
[2:06:12] THAT'S WHY JOHN IS WEEPING. He's saved.
[2:06:14] HE'S SEEN CALVARY. SEEN RESURRECTION.
[2:06:16] HE'S BORN AGAIN. HIS GIFTS OPERATING IN
[2:06:18] HIS LIFE. HE'S WEEPING BECAUSE ALL IS
[2:06:20] LOST. CALVARY WAS FOR THIS PURPOSE.
[2:06:23] WITHOUT THIS PURPOSE, WE HAVEN'T
[2:06:25] FULFILLED THE PURPOSE OF CALVARY.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS IS WHY THIS MESSAGE HAS COME
[2:06:30] AT THE END TIME TO TAKE THE VEIL OFF TO
[2:06:32] BRING US TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO WE
[2:06:34] ARE AND WHO GOD IS AND WHAT GOD'S BEEN
[2:06:36] DOING.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Took a prophet to unveil this. Amen.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; So
[2:06:47] now it belongs to the lamb.
[2:06:51] Who is the lamb? Jesus Christ.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Who is the lamb? The man.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; The last Adam.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; The head of the family.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; My big brother.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; My bridegroom.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; My husband.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Making me an heir of God and a joint
[2:07:11] heir
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; of Christ. Amen.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; When he took the book,
[2:07:19] let's just back up. I got to slow down.
[2:07:23] When he rose,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; I rose.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; When he sitted in heavenly places, I'm
[2:07:31] seated in heavenly places.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; And when he took the book,
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; I took the book.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:39] Not physically, not anything like that,
[2:07:42] but I'm part of him. He took it for me.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; He took it for the whole family. He took
[2:07:49] it for everybody in the book, everybody
[2:07:51] that was part of the inheritance. He
[2:07:53] took it for me.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; God's laws required. He's the one that
[2:08:01] holds it. God's law required a kinsman
[2:08:03] redeemer. And the lamb came out boldly.
[2:08:07] I am their kinsman. I am their redeemer.
[2:08:09] I now have made intercession for them.
[2:08:11] And now I've come to claim their rights
[2:08:13] for them. Amen. Amen. I've come to claim
[2:08:16] their rights. And that they have a right
[2:08:18] to everything that lost in the fall. And
[2:08:21] I've paid the price.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read this next quote.
[2:08:26] He says, "No one, no one could do it.
[2:08:29] And he walks right up to the right hand
[2:08:31] of God and took the book out of his hand
[2:08:33] and claimed his rights. I have died for
[2:08:35] them. I am their kinsman redeemer. I am
[2:08:38] the mediator. My blood was shed. I have
[2:08:40] become man. And I did this in order to
[2:08:43] get the church back again. And one I for
[2:08:45] the one I foresaw before the foundation
[2:08:47] of the world. I have purposed it. I
[2:08:49] spoke that it would be there. And nobody
[2:08:51] was able to take it. But I went down and
[2:08:53] done it myself. I am their kinsman. I
[2:08:56] become kin folks. And he takes the book.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. my representation, my headship, MY
[2:09:05] LORD, MY big brother, the head of the
[2:09:08] family that I'm part of.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; By spiritual new birth, the new
[2:09:11] creation, he's the first of that
[2:09:13] creation. I'm part of that creation
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; under his headship.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. WHEN HE TOOK THE BOOK, I
[2:09:22] wish I'd been there.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; And I know it didn't happen like that.
[2:09:25] It's not like you could be there. This
[2:09:27] happened before the foundation of the
[2:09:28] world in the mind of God. But listen,
[2:09:30] friends.
[2:09:31] Mhm.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, he took it for all of us.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Not one of us could approach to that
[2:09:38] throne. Not one of us could go in that
[2:09:40] presence. Not one of us could touch that
[2:09:42] book. Amen. But he came and paid the
[2:09:44] price. He became us. Paid the price so
[2:09:46] that he could go into that presence.
[2:09:48] That he could stand there and he could
[2:09:50] be judged and he could be found with no
[2:09:51] fault. And he could be saying, "I am the
[2:09:53] lion of the tribe of Judah. I have the
[2:09:55] rights. I am the seed and offspring of
[2:09:57] David. I have the rights. And I am the
[2:10:00] lamb that was a substitutionary
[2:10:01] offering. I SHED MY BLOOD. I BOUGHT IT
[2:10:04] BACK. I HAVE EVERY RIGHT NOW TO take the
[2:10:06] book.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, I COULDN'T DO IT, BUT HE
[2:10:10] COULD do it. And when he did it, he did
[2:10:11] it for ME AND ON MY BEHALF. AND I GET
[2:10:13] THE BENEFIT OF him taking it. AND I WANT
[2:10:15] TO SAY HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE TOOK
[2:10:18] THE BOOK.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING IN THE
[2:10:22] FUTURE, FRIENDS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE
[2:10:24] LIVING IN RIGHT NOW.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING ON ALL AROUND US. WE'RE
[2:10:28] PART OF IT.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; In the breach, HE SAID, "THE TRUMPET OF
[2:10:34] GOD SHALL SOUND. THE LAST TRUMP WILL
[2:10:36] BLAST FORTH." THE SAME TIME THE LAST
[2:10:38] ANGEL'S giving his message and the last
[2:10:40] seal IS OPEN, THAT LAST trumpet will
[2:10:42] sound and the redeemer comes forth to
[2:10:44] take his redeemed possession, his church
[2:10:47] blood washed.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go down here to verse 13.
[2:10:57] And every creature which is in heaven,
[2:10:59] and on the earth, and under the earth,
[2:11:01] and such as are in the sea, and all that
[2:11:03] are in them, heard I saying, "Blessing,
[2:11:06] and honor, and glory, and power be unto
[2:11:08] him that siteth upon the throne, and
[2:11:10] unto the Lamb forever and ever."
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT? THIS IS THE WEEPING ONE.
[2:11:16] BEFORE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER,
[2:11:18] he's weeping BECAUSE ALL IS LOST. BUT
[2:11:20] NOW, THERE WAS A MAN that could come
[2:11:22] forth AND TAKE THE BOOK. AND WHEN HE
[2:11:24] TOOK THE BOOK, ALL HEAVEN ERUPTED IN
[2:11:26] PRAISE. And when HEAVEN ERUPTED IN
[2:11:28] PRAISE, AS SOON AS THERE WAS A PAUSE, WE
[2:11:30] HEAR JOHN, WHICH IS A TYPE OF THE BRIDE.
[2:11:32] HE SAID, "EVERYTHING THAT EVER WAS in
[2:11:35] heaven, on earth, UNDER THE EARTH, IN
[2:11:37] THE SEA, AND ALL THAT THERE IS, HEARD
[2:11:39] ME." LISTEN, THAT MUST BE SOME SORT OF
[2:11:41] PRAISING THAT HE WAS DOING, SAYING,
[2:11:43] "BLESSING." AMEN. He He said, "Oh,
[2:11:46] praise God." I want to read it the way
[2:11:48] he said it. He said, uh, blessing and
[2:11:51] honor AND GLORY AND POWER BE UNTO HIM
[2:11:53] THAT SITETH UPON the throne and unto the
[2:11:55] lamb FOREVER AND EVER. OH, PRAISE GOD.
[2:11:59] HE TOOK THE BOOK.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. THIS IS REDEMPTION. PRAISE
[2:12:04] GOD. WHAT ADAM LOST HAS COME BACK INTO
[2:12:06] THE HANDS OF MAN. BECAUSE THERE WAS A
[2:12:08] MAN WHO PAID THE PRICE. THERE WAS A MAN
[2:12:10] WHO SAT THROUGH INTERCESSION THROUGH
[2:12:12] SEVEN CHURCH AGE TO MAKE SURE HIS BRIDE
[2:12:14] WAS SECURE. BUT AT THE END TIME, HE CAME
[2:12:16] FORTH TO TAKE HIS POSSESSION, HIS
[2:12:18] INHERITANCE, HIS RIGHTS. AND HE'S COME
[2:12:20] DOWN TO UNITE WITH HIS BRIDE. PRAISE
[2:12:22] GOD. HE TOOK THE BOOK.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; WHO? The man. Christ Jesus.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Our headship, our king, our Lord, our
[2:12:32] brother.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; He took the book.
[2:12:37] That's what this message is all about.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; People get caught up in he said this
[2:12:46] here and this here and the rules about
[2:12:47] this and can I do this AND LISTEN THAT'S
[2:12:50] THAT'S NOT WHY THE MESSENGER CAME.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; This is why he came
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE WERE LOCKED DOWN IN
[2:12:57] DENOMINATIONALISM. WE WERE BLINDED AND
[2:12:59] DARKENED AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHERE WE
[2:13:01] CAME FROM, WHERE WE WERE GOING, WHAT IT
[2:13:03] WAS ALL ABOUT. AND THE MESSENGER CAME TO
[2:13:05] TAKE GOD THROUGH THAT MESSENGER TOOK THE
[2:13:07] VEIL OFF THE BIBLE. SO WE WOULD
[2:13:09] UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM, WHY WE'RE
[2:13:11] FALLEN, WHAT WE LOST, HOW IT GETS
[2:13:13] REDEEMED, WHO REDEEMED IT. AND SO THAT
[2:13:15] WE COULD REALIZE WE live in the day it's
[2:13:17] redeemed. It's redeemed. IT'S REDEEMED.
[2:13:21] WHICH MEANS I'M REDEEMED. I'M REDEEMED.
[2:13:24] I'M REDEEMED.
[2:13:25] AND NOT ONLY THAT, HE CAME DOWN A MIGHTY
[2:13:28] ANGEL. HE came down with an OPEN BOOK IN
[2:13:30] HIS HAND TO DO WHAT? HE CAME DOWN TO
[2:13:33] UNITE WITH WHAT HE REDEEMED. AND THE
[2:13:35] FIRST PART OF THAT UNITING TAKES PLACE
[2:13:37] WITH A BRIDE, A PEOPLE THAT'S ON THE
[2:13:39] EARTH AT THE TIME OF THIS COMING. AND HE
[2:13:41] UNITES with them first.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; And this is uniting time and signs.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; This is what the message is about.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Everything else feeds into this. This is
[2:13:58] the purpose.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] Praise almighty God.
[2:14:05] Get in the breach. He said, "Watch. Look
[2:14:06] at this. My broke the seals. Revealed
[2:14:09] the mysteries. Revealed them where? To
[2:14:11] the last church age. The only one that's
[2:14:13] living. The rest of them sleeping." He
[2:14:16] said, "If he comes in the first watch,
[2:14:18] second watch, third watch, on down to
[2:14:19] the seventh watch." In the seventh
[2:14:21] watch, there went out a commander call.
[2:14:23] Behold, the bridegroom cometh.
[2:14:32] What
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; we're talking about a Revelation chapter
[2:14:37] 5, chapter 6, chapter 8, chapter 10.
[2:14:44] And he said
[2:14:47] in the seventh watch there went on a
[2:14:50] command when when he broke the seals
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; when he revealed the mystery
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; there was a call that the bridegroom
[2:14:58] cometh.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Listen friends this is what taking the
[2:15:01] book is all about.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; It's about a marriage.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call now came and said
[2:15:09] now come out.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Come out from her. Come out of the city.
[2:15:14] Come out. You fair young virgins. Come
[2:15:16] out. You that have the Holy Ghost, come
[2:15:18] out and meet who?
[2:15:21] Come out to who?
[2:15:24] The friend of the bridegroom made the
[2:15:25] call. But the call was not to come to
[2:15:27] the friend of the bridegroom. The call
[2:15:29] was the bridegroom cometh. COME YOU OUT
[2:15:32] TO MEET HIM.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; THE CALL AMEN. THROUGH MALACHI 4. THE
[2:15:38] CALL WAS TO MEET THE BRIDEGROOM where
[2:15:41] between there and here. In between we
[2:15:45] COME OUT OF THE DENOMINATIONAL CITIES.
[2:15:47] HE COMES DOWN from glory. We meet up in
[2:15:49] the MIDDLE AND THEN HE TAKES US INTO THE
[2:15:52] MARRIAGE.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S TIES TOGETHER ALL THE
[2:15:56] PARABLES THAT BROTHER BRENNAN WAS
[2:15:58] TEACHING AND EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS
[2:15:59] SHOWING. IT ALL POINTS TO THE SAME
[2:16:00] THING. TAKING THE BOOK IS TAKING HIS
[2:16:03] BRIDE, taking his church, the ones that
[2:16:04] he's redeemed, the ones THAT HE PAID THE
[2:16:06] PRICE FOR TO GO BACK AND LIVE AS ADAM
[2:16:08] AND EVE AGAIN UPON THE EARTH TO
[2:16:10] REESTABLISH GOD'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE AND
[2:16:13] PLAN.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; OH, praise God. No wonder John was
[2:16:18] shouting.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; He says, see, he's done his kinsman
[2:16:24] work. You know what the kinsman work was
[2:16:26] to testify before the elders? You
[2:16:28] remember Boaz kicking off his shoes and
[2:16:30] so forth. He's done all this now. Now he
[2:16:32] comes to take his bride. Amen. He comes
[2:16:34] now as a king. He's looking for his
[2:16:37] queen.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; I thought he was taking a book.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; No, he's coming for his book.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; He comes with THE REVELATION OF THE BOOK
[2:16:48] LOOKING FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE BOOK
[2:16:49] LOOKING TO UNITE WITH THE BOOK.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; He's a king. He's looking for HIS QUEEN.
[2:16:55] AMEN. WHAT KING? THE LION OF THE TRIBE
[2:16:57] OF JUDAH. THE ROOT AND OFFSPRING OF
[2:16:59] DAVID. THE ONE WHO PAID THE PRICE, THE
[2:17:01] ONE WHO TOOK THE BOOK. NOW HE'S coming
[2:17:04] looking for his queen.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; And this book is the whole secret of it
[2:17:08] wrapped up around seven seals. Oh,
[2:17:10] brother. Seven seals waiting for him to
[2:17:13] come. Let's go to Revelation 10 now.
[2:17:20] Verse one.
[2:17:24] We'll finish here.
[2:17:29] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[2:17:31] from heaven clothed with a cloud.
[2:17:33] Brother Venom said, "No other but Christ
[2:17:35] it could be."
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; He also told us the seventh angel is on
[2:17:39] earth at the time of this coming.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; So Christ comes while the seventh
[2:17:44] angel's on earth.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; But look how he comes clothed with a
[2:17:49] cloud and a rainbow upon his head and
[2:17:51] his face was it were the sun and his
[2:17:52] feet as pillars of fire. And he had in
[2:17:55] his hand a little book open.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; And he set his right foot upon the sea
[2:18:00] and his left foot upon the earth. And
[2:18:02] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[2:18:04] roar. And when he had cried, seven
[2:18:06] thunders uttered their voices.
[2:18:10] He came with a little book. Brother Ram
[2:18:11] said, the same book that was closed in
[2:18:14] Revelation chapter 5 is open and what
[2:18:17] did he bring? He's tore the seals of
[2:18:19] he's come and brought the revelation of
[2:18:20] what the mystery has been all about.
[2:18:23] and he brought it with him.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; He brought it down with him
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; and he declared it through a prophet.
[2:18:30] But the prophet's not the one who had
[2:18:32] it. The prophet's not the one who took
[2:18:33] it. The prophet's not the one who opened
[2:18:35] the seals. The prophet was just a
[2:18:37] mouthpiece of Christ.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; He's the one who took the book and
[2:18:41] loosed the seals and brought down and
[2:18:44] opened, which means revealed, unveiled
[2:18:47] book of redemption.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:53] Now let's go down to verse eight.
[2:18:57] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[2:18:59] spake unto me again and said, "Go and
[2:19:02] take the little book
[2:19:05] which is open in the hand of the angel
[2:19:07] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[2:19:09] earth." And I went unto the angel and
[2:19:11] said unto him, "Give me the little
[2:19:13] book." And he said unto me, "Take it and
[2:19:16] eat it up. I shall make thy belly bitter
[2:19:18] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[2:19:20] honey. And I took the little book out of
[2:19:23] the angel's hand and ate it up. And it
[2:19:25] was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as
[2:19:27] soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[2:19:28] bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must
[2:19:31] prophesy again before many peoples and
[2:19:34] nations and tongues and kings."
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. This mystery of redemption, this
[2:19:41] mystery of the entire Bible,
[2:19:44] this purpose of God that he had in his
[2:19:46] mind before the foundation of the world,
[2:19:48] Christ brought it as an open book.
[2:19:52] And when he come down to earth, he had
[2:19:53] to do it at the time the seventh angel
[2:19:55] was on. So we know when this happened.
[2:19:56] This happened in 1963.
[2:19:59] And he brought access to the book down
[2:20:01] to earth.
[2:20:03] But then there was a voice from heaven.
[2:20:05] The same one that I believe that told
[2:20:07] John to come a little higher in chapter
[2:20:09] three. He said, "I will show you things
[2:20:11] to come." Now there's another voice from
[2:20:13] heaven that says unto him, "Take the
[2:20:16] book out of the hand of the mighty
[2:20:18] angel."
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; And he went to the angel and he said,
[2:20:23] "Give me the book." And the mighty says,
[2:20:25] "Take it." And it says, "And he John
[2:20:30] took the book."
[2:20:33] That means there's another taking of the
[2:20:36] book.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Not just chapter five taking of the
[2:20:40] book.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; There's a Revelation chapter 10 taking
[2:20:44] of the book.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; And who took the book?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; The unworthy John.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; The one who was not worthy. The one who
[2:20:54] was not able. The one who couldn't touch
[2:20:55] it. The one who couldn't open the seals.
[2:20:57] The one who couldn't read it, the one
[2:20:59] who couldn't even look at it.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; The one who was weeping because all was
[2:21:03] lost saw the lamb come forth and take
[2:21:05] the book. And now the mighty angel
[2:21:07] brings it down in Revelation 10. And
[2:21:09] after and we have Revelation 10:7. Now
[2:21:11] there's a voice that says, "Now John,
[2:21:14] you take the book."
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; How is John going TO TAKE THE BOOK? HE
[2:21:20] CAN ONLY GET IT FROM THE mighty angel.
[2:21:23] Amen. He can only GET IT FROM CHRIST.
[2:21:25] HE'S GOT TO GO. WHY? WHY DID CHRIST COME
[2:21:27] WITH AN OPEN BOOK FOR? HE'S COME AS a
[2:21:30] king looking for his queen. He's looking
[2:21:32] for SOMEBODY FROM THE BOOK TO UNITE WITH
[2:21:34] THE BOOK AND SOMEBODY TO GIVE THE BOOK
[2:21:36] TO. WHY? CUZ HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S
[2:21:39] HEIR TO THE INHERITANCE. BUT HE BOUGHT
[2:21:42] IT BACK FOR THE FAMILY. AND DON'T
[2:21:44] FORGET, WE ARE JOINT HEIRS WITH CHRIST
[2:21:46] OF THIS INHERITANCE THAT ADAM LOST. AND
[2:21:49] SO NOW HE'S COME LOOKING FOR HIS QUEEN.
[2:21:51] WHAT'S HE LOOKING FOR? THE OTHER CO-AIR.
[2:21:54] I'VE GOT SOMEBODY ELSE. I BOUGHT THIS
[2:21:56] BACK FOR THE FAMILY OF GOD. I'M LOOKING
[2:21:58] FOR THE FAMILY OF GOD. HOW WILL HE FIND
[2:22:00] THE FAMILY OF GOD? HE SOUNDS SEVEN
[2:22:02] THUNDERS IN A MYSTERY WAY. AND THOSE WHO
[2:22:05] HEAR THE THUNDERS AND UNDERSTAND THE
[2:22:06] THUNDERS ARE JOHN. AMEN. IN A MYSTERY
[2:22:09] FORM. AND THOSE WHEN YOU HEARD AND WHEN
[2:22:11] YOU HEARD THE MYSTERIES REVEALED, YOU
[2:22:13] HEARD HIM CALLING YOUR NAME OUT OF THE
[2:22:15] BOOK. AND YOU CAME TO THE MIGHTY ANGEL
[2:22:18] AND SAID, "I BELIEVE THAT MESSAGE. I
[2:22:20] BELIEVE THAT'S THE TRUTH. I BELIEVE YOU
[2:22:22] ARE HERE. AND I WANT TO BE PART OF YOUR
[2:22:25] PROGRAM.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; I want TO BE YOUR JOINT HEIR. I WANT TO
[2:22:28] BE YOUR WIFE. I WANT TO UNITE WITH YOU.
[2:22:29] AND I WANT YOU TO BE my headship.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; MY FIRST HEADSHIP IS FAILED. THE CHURCH
[2:22:36] HEADSHIP IS FAILED. BUT I WANT THIS
[2:22:38] MIGHTY ANGEL CHRIST TO BE MY HEADSHIP.
[2:22:40] THE ONE WITH THE mystery revealed.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; And he comes to whisper love secrets in
[2:22:45] her ears. This is what I've been doing.
[2:22:48] This is what I've done all along. This
[2:22:49] is how I've done it. This is why this.
[2:22:51] And this is why that. And this is why
[2:22:53] that and now I've brought it down.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; I brought it down to the joint
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; hes.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't keep it for himself. He didn't
[2:23:06] take it for himself. It was his to take.
[2:23:09] He took it to take back Adam, but not
[2:23:11] for himself alone.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; And he will rule and reign on the earth.
[2:23:15] And we will rule and reign with him.
[2:23:17] Yes.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WAS SAID AS SOON AS HE TOOK
[2:23:19] THE BOOK THAT HE will rule and reign and
[2:23:21] we he's made us kings and priests and we
[2:23:23] will rule and reign on earth with him.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; HE BROUGHT US BACK TO what Adam lost
[2:23:27] when he took the book. But old friends,
[2:23:31] he's looking for the joint heir of the
[2:23:32] book.
[2:23:34] The joint heir of the book is those who
[2:23:37] hear the bridegroom call
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; through Malachi 4 and leave the city and
[2:23:44] run not to meet the friend of the
[2:23:46] bridegroom, but the one who will run
[2:23:48] past the friend of the bridegroom
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; and go embrace the bridegroom,
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; which is Christ, the last Adam.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Our husband.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; This is about more than we ever thought
[2:24:01] it was about. Friends, this is what this
[2:24:03] message came for.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Now in union with Christ, now he's
[2:24:09] living his life through us. Now in a
[2:24:12] redemption, now he says you must
[2:24:15] prophesy again.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Now when you take the book,
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; you prophesy again.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; And that is what I have done for the
[2:24:25] last two hours.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; I have prophesied the contents of that
[2:24:30] book.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; If you wanted to know what's in the
[2:24:33] book,
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; you just heard it cuz I just prophesied
[2:24:36] again.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; And that's all of our job is to declare
[2:24:40] this glorious gospel. Amen. You say,
[2:24:42] "Declare the gospel." People think of
[2:24:43] Calvary. Calvary was for a purpose. The
[2:24:46] gospel purpose is the good news. And the
[2:24:48] good news IS WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD'S
[2:24:50] ORIGINAL POSITION, original plan for HIS
[2:24:53] SONS AND DAUGHTERS. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
[2:24:55] HEADED RIGHT NOW in this hour. Amen.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation 19. This is the
[2:25:04] last scripture I want to read. Oh, I've
[2:25:05] got it overhead.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; So, I fell at his feet to worship. This
[2:25:10] is the angel that told him all things.
[2:25:11] This represents Brother Brandon. And he
[2:25:13] said unto me, "See thou do it not. I am
[2:25:15] thy fellow servant and of thy brethren
[2:25:17] that have the testimony of Jesus.
[2:25:19] Worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[2:25:22] is the spirit of prophecy."
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to prophesy again?
[2:25:27] testify of Jesus.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Who? The last Adam.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; The one who bought it back. The one who
[2:25:33] purchased it, the kinsman redeemer, the
[2:25:35] bridegroom, the one who came and brought
[2:25:36] an open book that's available to the
[2:25:38] co-airs today.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Testimony also means witness
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; to witness like in court. And that's
[2:25:47] what we're doing as we take this book.
[2:25:48] We're witnessing of Jesus Christ. And
[2:25:52] we're saying, "Behold the man."
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I couldn't do it. I wasn't worthy. I was
[2:25:58] lost. There was no hope. But he took the
[2:26:00] book.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; And after he took the book, he brought
[2:26:03] it down and gave access to the co-airs.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I'm part of that.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; I just want to leave you with one last
[2:26:13] thought if I may.
[2:26:17] God has always through the Bible been
[2:26:19] doing absolutely marvelous things,
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; unbelievable things in his plan of
[2:26:25] redemption.
[2:26:27] But you know the majority of it went
[2:26:28] unnoticed by the world.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bam told us at the
[2:26:33] opening of the seals he said don't look
[2:26:34] for great big things.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; He said God hiding in simplicity
[2:26:41] revealing in the same. comes to the
[2:26:42] seventh. See, when he says, "How did I
[2:26:44] know a week ago when I was saying be
[2:26:45] simple, be simple, it'll be simp how did
[2:26:48] I know what I was talking about?"
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way it comes in
[2:26:52] such a simple way." They walk right over
[2:26:54] it and they miss it a million miles.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; And if you think about Calvary, friends,
[2:26:58] Jesus Christ came and he lived a
[2:27:00] miraculous life and he had healing
[2:27:02] campaigns and he did the things that he
[2:27:03] did.
[2:27:06] At the end of his life, he was taken and
[2:27:08] judged as a criminal, falsely accused,
[2:27:11] shamed, and crucified. And at the
[2:27:14] crucifixion, there was quite a stir.
[2:27:16] There was an earthquake. There was a
[2:27:17] blackout of the sun. All these things
[2:27:19] happened. But, you know, there was only
[2:27:21] a couple people that were even queued in
[2:27:23] on what was going on.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; And even the disciples had no
[2:27:28] understanding of what was happening.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; None.
[2:27:34] Do you know the day after the
[2:27:35] crucifixion?
[2:27:38] You know the crucifixion was one of the
[2:27:40] most powerful things that have ever
[2:27:42] happened on earth for humankind.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; The greatest act of redemption, the
[2:27:48] shedding of blood, the the purchase
[2:27:49] price paid for everything that Adam
[2:27:51] lost. Amen. Everything we needed to be
[2:27:53] redeemed back. It was one of the most
[2:27:55] powerful acts that ever took place.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And only a few hundred people or a
[2:28:01] few thousand people on the whole planet
[2:28:02] knew about it.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; After that powerful event of God
[2:28:07] fulfilling his word and how many
[2:28:08] prophecies were fulfilled in the last
[2:28:10] few hours of Jesus' life.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible clicking away. Prophecy one
[2:28:14] after the other after the other. Then
[2:28:15] the sun blackened. Then an earthquake.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; You know what happened the next morning?
[2:28:22] The sun came up and birds started
[2:28:24] chirping.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; And life went on as usual. Yes, sir.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; People went to the well, women exchanged
[2:28:31] gossip. There might have been a little
[2:28:33] stir about that blackout of the sun.
[2:28:34] That was so strange. I That was weird.
[2:28:36] You think it was a sign, then an
[2:28:38] earthquake, and maybe it was the stir
[2:28:40] for a little bit. And then maybe news
[2:28:42] that Jesus resurrected became a stir,
[2:28:44] but it all began to fade away. And they
[2:28:46] would meet at the well and exchange the
[2:28:47] gospel and go to the market and get
[2:28:49] hungry and
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Just went on as if nothing changed.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:55] Only for the believers did their life
[2:28:57] change.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody else went on as if nothing
[2:29:01] changed in their whole life. One of the
[2:29:03] most monumental things that could ever
[2:29:05] happen upon this earth just took place
[2:29:07] and the earth kept spinning. The sun
[2:29:09] kept coming up. The rain kept falling
[2:29:11] and people kept getting up and going to
[2:29:12] work every day.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Even the disciples in the time of the
[2:29:18] crucifixion of the resurrection didn't
[2:29:19] know what to do. They didn't know what
[2:29:21] was going on. They were confused about
[2:29:23] what was happening. I can imagine them
[2:29:25] sitting there for a day in depression
[2:29:27] and shock and bewildered and not knowing
[2:29:29] what to do. And one of them says, "You
[2:29:31] know what? I'm hungry." The other one
[2:29:33] says, "I'm hungry, too. Let me get
[2:29:35] something to eat."
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; They didn't understand what had
[2:29:44] happened.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; They were still uncertain, depressed,
[2:29:47] yes, I'm sure. Scared, shocked, all of
[2:29:50] the above.
[2:29:52] But they fell asleep at night. They woke
[2:29:54] up in the morning, got hungry, ate,
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; life moved on.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Weeks after the crucifixion, when the
[2:30:01] news and the gossip faded away,
[2:30:03] Jerusalem went about its business.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Church services went on. The priests
[2:30:08] were offering sacrifices.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; And it was all dead.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Because God had flipped a switch at
[2:30:14] Calvary.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; And no more substitutionary offerings
[2:30:17] through lambs and goats and through
[2:30:18] Jerusalem and through the temple
[2:30:20] worship. Now it was Christ and him
[2:30:22] alone.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know that.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't believe it. They kept on
[2:30:28] offering lambs. They kept on offering
[2:30:29] goats. They kept on doing their thing.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; One of the most monumental prophecies in
[2:30:34] all the Bible all the way back in
[2:30:36] Genesis 3. This was prophesied of
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; the first prophecy now fulfilled
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; of redemption.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; And the world just keeps going on like
[2:30:46] nothing happened. Every morning the dogs
[2:30:48] barked,
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; chickens crowed, birds chirped. It all
[2:30:53] went on.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; And man kept walking on the earth like
[2:30:57] everything was as the day before. It was
[2:31:00] only at the day of Pentecost when the
[2:31:02] believers got the Holy Ghost. The
[2:31:06] teacher on the inside that Peter stood
[2:31:08] up and says, "This is that and this is
[2:31:11] that and this is that. This is
[2:31:13] everything fulfilled. This is what was
[2:31:14] prophesied. This is what was promised
[2:31:16] and this re this promise is what's come
[2:31:18] upon US BECAUSE OF CALVARY. THIS IS
[2:31:20] WHERE WE'RE AT.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; A few thousand believed and there was a
[2:31:25] stir and there was a a revival and there
[2:31:27] was things going on and then it began to
[2:31:29] fade away. And only through the
[2:31:32] believers was the truth carried on.
[2:31:35] But just because the birds chirped in
[2:31:38] the morning and the sun came up and the
[2:31:40] rain fell and people went to work and
[2:31:41] everything returned as normal doesn't
[2:31:44] mean it wasn't the most monumental thing
[2:31:46] that had ever happened on earth.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; The same thing happened in March of
[2:31:52] 1963.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. the fulfillment of the sublime,
[2:31:58] most sublime scripture
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; and all the Bible.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; In that week of meetings in
[2:32:03] Jeffersonville, Indiana, something
[2:32:06] incredible was taking place. The lamb
[2:32:08] was proving he had overcome. He had paid
[2:32:10] the part of intercessor at the end of
[2:32:12] churches. He was coming forth to take
[2:32:14] the book and to loose the seals. AND HE
[2:32:16] WAS COMING DOWN WITH the open book and
[2:32:18] the sounding of the seven thunders. And
[2:32:20] it was him himself coming down. And he
[2:32:22] proved it at the opening of the seals in
[2:32:24] that week of meetings in March in
[2:32:26] Jeffersonville in 1963.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; And people were moved and supernatural
[2:32:32] healings took place AND PEOPLE WERE
[2:32:34] ASTOUNDED AT THINGS THEY HEARD,
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; but they didn't quite get it.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; And Sunday after the meetings, they
[2:32:41] started driving to Georgia and Alabama.
[2:32:43] And no doubt they drove along and said,
[2:32:44] "Those were powerful meetings." And what
[2:32:46] did he mean by this? I don't quite get
[2:32:47] it. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. BUT I COULD JUST
[2:32:49] SENSE THAT IT WAS POWERFUL. SOMETHING
[2:32:51] HAPPENED. IT was great. And then they
[2:32:53] woke up in the morning and put on their
[2:32:54] boots and went to work.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; And Jeffersonville, the the the the news
[2:33:00] boy with the newspaper, the paper boy.
[2:33:02] You hear ching ching and he throws the
[2:33:04] paper and you hear clump
[2:33:07] clump. Every driveway he's throwing
[2:33:09] another paper
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; as if nothing had happened.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; Don't look for great big things.
[2:33:19] You'll miss it a million miles.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; We're in the same place those early
[2:33:24] disciples were in the first church. They
[2:33:26] knew they had come in contact with the
[2:33:28] living God. The the fulfillment of pro
[2:33:30] prophecy. It didn't matter how many
[2:33:32] millions denied it and how few believed
[2:33:34] it. They knew beyond a shadow of a doubt
[2:33:36] that they were now part of the program,
[2:33:38] what the program was, where they were in
[2:33:40] redemption, and that Christ had come.
[2:33:42] Amen. Emanuel, the lamb of God, and paid
[2:33:44] the price in Calvary and resurrected.
[2:33:46] And when he rose, we rose. And Paul
[2:33:48] starts preaching and going on missionary
[2:33:49] journeys. But everywhere he goes, he
[2:33:51] gets a little pocket of people, A LITTLE
[2:33:52] POCKET OF PEOPLE, a little pocket OF
[2:33:53] PEOPLE. EVERYBODY ELSE CARRIES ON. The
[2:33:55] birds chirp, the sun rises, it falls,
[2:33:57] they go to work. Do you understand what
[2:33:59] I'm saying?
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T LOOK AROUND AND SAY NOTHING'S
[2:34:02] HAPPENING. THE MOST MONUMENTAL THING
[2:34:04] THAT EVER HAPPENED IN THE SCRIPTURE TOOK
[2:34:06] PLACE IN THIS GENERATION. AND JUST
[2:34:08] BECAUSE NOBODY KNEW IT AND THE BIRDS
[2:34:10] CHIRPED IN THE MORNING AND THE DOGS
[2:34:11] BARKED AND THE PAPER BOY THREW A PAPER
[2:34:13] IN YOUR DRIVEWAY, DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T
[2:34:15] HAPPEN.
[2:34:17] IT'S THE SAME AS 2,000 YEARS AGO. WE ARE
[2:34:20] JUST IN THE SPOT THAT THEY WERE THEN.
[2:34:23] AND ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO'VE RECEIVED IT
[2:34:25] BY FAITH UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
[2:34:27] THIS WORLD. AND IT'S JUST AS POWERFUL
[2:34:29] TODAY AS IT WAS 2,000 YEARS AGO IN THE
[2:34:32] FIRST CHURCH IN THE BOOK OF ACTS. WE'RE
[2:34:34] HERE AGAIN.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW. AND NOW THEY WERE SENT TO
[2:34:40] PROPHESY AGAIN. JESUS SAID, "WHAT YOU'VE
[2:34:42] HEARD IN THE INNER CHAMBER, YOU TESTIFY
[2:34:44] ON THE ROOFTOP. I'LL SEND YOU OUT." AND
[2:34:46] EVERYBODY THAT RECEIVES YOUR WORD
[2:34:48] RECEIVES ME. I SEND YOU AS WOLVES AMONG
[2:34:50] SHEEP. AND HE SENT THEM OUT AFTER AFTER
[2:34:52] THEY WERE EMPOWERED BY THE HOLY GHOST TO
[2:34:54] DO WHAT? TO TAKE THIS GOSPEL MESSAGE ALL
[2:34:56] OVER THE WORLD. WHAT HAS GOD DONE TO US
[2:34:58] IN THIS GENERATION? IT'S THE SAME THING.
[2:35:01] EAT THE BOOK AND PROPHESY AGAIN. YOU ARE
[2:35:04] IN THE SAME SPOT THE FIRST CHURCH WAS.
[2:35:06] ONLY THEY NEVER MADE IT TO the fullness
[2:35:08] of redemption.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; They never made it to the marriage
[2:35:12] union. But we've come
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; and now the book is available
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; to you and I
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; and you can take and you can come to
[2:35:22] Christ and Christ can give you this re
[2:35:24] revelation of his redemption mystery
[2:35:26] that's been in the whole Bible AND HE
[2:35:28] CAN SHOW YOU THAT BY TAKING THE MYSTERY.
[2:35:31] AMEN. Taking the mystery of redemption
[2:35:33] you are a co-air.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; And now eat it
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; and go prophesy again.
[2:35:40] And what will happen tomorrow morning?
[2:35:43] The birds will chirp.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Sun will come up.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; The neighbor's dog will bark and you'll
[2:35:49] hear the trash truck coming down the
[2:35:51] road.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that you haven't
[2:35:53] become part of the greatest act of
[2:35:55] redemption that's taking place on the
[2:35:57] earth right now. And it doesn't mean you
[2:35:59] haven't come into a marriage union with
[2:36:00] Christ. And it doesn't mean you haven't
[2:36:03] uh ran past the voice of the friend of
[2:36:06] the bridegroom and connected with the
[2:36:07] bridegroom and entered into an invisible
[2:36:09] union are connected with your Christ and
[2:36:10] are feeding on the book. That doesn't
[2:36:12] mean just because the paper boy throws a
[2:36:14] paper in your your your mailbox AND THE
[2:36:17] TRASH TRUCK goes by and dumps your trash
[2:36:19] doesn't mean it hasn't happened.
[2:36:21] [Applause]
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brennan means by
[2:36:25] don't look for big things. Yes,
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; we're standing at the most monumental
[2:36:30] time in the history of mankind.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; God is finishing his work in a people,
[2:36:36] in a bride, in a church where the first
[2:36:39] church failed. He's brought this church
[2:36:40] back to continue on to finish what she
[2:36:43] didn't finish. And when that's finished,
[2:36:45] there'll be a resurrection of the
[2:36:46] sleeping saints. There'll be a
[2:36:47] glorification of our bodies. There'll be
[2:36:49] a three and a half year marriage supper.
[2:36:50] And there'll be a return to a millennial
[2:36:52] reign. AND WE ARE SMACK DAB IN THE
[2:36:54] MIDDLE OF THE MOST PROFOUND EVENT IN
[2:36:57] HISTORY.
[2:36:58] [Applause]
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; And you're going to hear the trash truck
[2:37:02] in the morning.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; And you might get a little frustrated
[2:37:05] because they always slam the lid so
[2:37:07] loud.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; But don't miss it
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; because it comes in simplicity.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; Don't deny it because nobody else sees
[2:37:17] it. Don't doubt it because it's not
[2:37:19] worldwide. Don't question it because
[2:37:21] it's not widely known.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; It should be known to you. It should be
[2:37:25] real to you. It should be part of your
[2:37:27] union. It should be part of your life.
[2:37:29] It should be the book you're feasting
[2:37:30] on. It should be Christ you're you're
[2:37:32] unifying with. It should be something
[2:37:34] that's real on the inside of you.
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; And don't miss it because of the
[2:37:39] simplicity.
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand together.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's profound, friends.
[2:37:49] Brother Benam, you said, "You think
[2:37:51] something like that would take place in
[2:37:52] the Vatican or a great place, but it's
[2:37:55] just like it was the first time
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; in a stable, in a manger of hay, a place
[2:38:01] so humble.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Nobody would have believed that it was
[2:38:05] breaking forth in a little brick
[2:38:07] building on the corner of 8th and Penn
[2:38:09] Street
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; in Jeffersonville, Indiana. But it was
[2:38:12] just the same.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Just the same as Christ was being born
[2:38:17] in a manger in Nazareth. Just the same
[2:38:19] as he was coming down and revealing his
[2:38:21] presence through the opening of the
[2:38:22] seals and the corner and a little brick
[2:38:24] building on the corner of ETH and Penn.
[2:38:26] It was every bit as much of fulfillment
[2:38:28] there as it was 2,000 years ago.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; And the world is looking there
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; and they're missing what's happened
[2:38:37] right beside them.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; That's what's always happened, friends.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:41] Let's not miss it.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; Let's enjoy it. Let's benefit from it.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; Musicians, if you'll come, please. And
[2:38:49] Brother Riley, if you'll come. I tell
[2:38:52] you, friends, I'm more excited about
[2:38:54] this gospel than I've ever been in my
[2:38:55] whole life.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much troubles come
[2:38:59] on the earth and difficulties and ups
[2:39:01] and downs and backs and forth. It can't
[2:39:03] take this reality out of my heart. This
[2:39:05] is the thing I live for. This is the
[2:39:07] reality of the message to me.
[2:39:11] If all we see is restored doctrine,
[2:39:14] we're going to end up confused.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; If all we see is better teaching, a
[2:39:21] better way to raise a family, and a
[2:39:22] better life, we're going to end up train
[2:39:24] wrecked and derailed somewhere along the
[2:39:25] way.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; But if we see the revelation of the open
[2:39:29] book, if we see Christ himself coming to
[2:39:32] unite with his co-airs and bring the
[2:39:34] open book, if you haven't seen the other
[2:39:37] taking of the book,
[2:39:42] What is the other taking of the book in
[2:39:44] the book of Revelations? It's when I
[2:39:46] took the book.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; It's when I ate the book. It's when I
[2:39:50] became one with the book. It's when the
[2:39:52] book began to live out of me.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 is when he took his
[2:39:58] bride
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; from the hand of the father.
[2:40:02] Revelation chapter 10 is when he asked
[2:40:04] the bride to come into union with him so
[2:40:07] he can impregnate her. So what he is can
[2:40:09] come out of John.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; Prophesy again.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; I say God, I want to eat your book.
[2:40:18] Listen, don't think paper. Don't think
[2:40:20] scrolls.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; Think of the great mystery revelation
[2:40:23] God has held in his mind all this time.
[2:40:26] God, I want to feed on that and become
[2:40:27] one with that. And I want my life, my
[2:40:30] words, my actions to testify
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; Say, behold.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. the man.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; Our headship,
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; our bridegroom, our brother, the one
[2:40:45] that I'm identified with. My
[2:40:47] righteousness in him. My salvation is in
[2:40:49] him. My deliverance is in him. My family
[2:40:51] is in him. Everything is in him and I'm
[2:40:54] in him and I'm secure in him. And
[2:40:56] everything's fine in him. And I'm saved
[2:40:58] in him.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; Behold the man.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Can we sing that
[2:41:04] song Riley I mentioned to you earlier?
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; Wonderful,
[2:41:09] merciful
[2:41:11] Savior,
[2:41:14] precious redeemer
[2:41:16] and friend.
[2:41:20] Who would have thought that a lamb
[2:41:25] could
[2:41:26] rescue the souls of men?
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, you rescue the souls of men.
[2:41:39] You are the one that we praise.
[2:41:45] You are the one we adore. Lord,
[2:41:51] you give the healing and grace
[2:41:56] our hearts always hunger for.
[2:42:02] Oh, our hearts always hunger for
[2:42:09] counselor,
[2:42:11] comforter, keeper,
[2:42:15] spirit we long to embrace.
[2:42:21] You offer hope when our hearts
[2:42:27] hopeless we lost our way.
[2:42:32] Oh, we hopeless we lost the way.
[2:42:39] You are the one that we praise.
[2:42:45] You are the one we adore.
[2:42:50] Lord, you give the healing and grace
[2:42:56] our
[2:42:57] hearts always hunger for.
[2:43:02] Oh, our hearts always hunger for
[2:43:09] Almighty
[2:43:11] in Father,
[2:43:15] faithfully loving your own.
[2:43:21] Here in our weakness, you find
[2:43:25] us
[2:43:27] falling before your throne.
[2:43:31] Oh, we're falling before your throne.
[2:43:38] You are the one that we praise.
[2:43:44] You are the one we adore.
[2:43:50] You give the healing and grace.
[2:43:56] Our soul is wonderful.
[2:43:59] [Music]
[2:44:00] Oh, our hearts always hunger.
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[2:44:10] Oh, heavenly father, we're so thankful,
[2:44:12] Lord.
[2:44:14] God, when it required a man, you became
[2:44:16] the man. You created a body to dwell in,
[2:44:19] Lord, that you could reconcile us to
[2:44:21] yourself in the flesh of our Lord Jesus
[2:44:24] Christ.
[2:44:26] Oh God, how we love you and thank you
[2:44:28] for your plan of redemption. Lord, it's
[2:44:31] so beautiful from beginning to end. And
[2:44:33] I'm so grateful, Lord, to live in the
[2:44:36] age that we live in the day, Lord, when
[2:44:38] you've taken the veil off the mystery
[2:44:40] that you held within yourself,
[2:44:43] God. How wonderful, how precious, how
[2:44:45] beautiful.
[2:44:47] And to think, Lord, by your loving
[2:44:49] grace, you have called us to be a
[2:44:51] partaker
[2:44:52] in this revelation in this hour.
[2:44:56] God, we stand just as unworthy as John
[2:44:58] did in Revelation five. Unable and
[2:45:02] uncapable,
[2:45:03] worthless, Lord, to be able to redeem
[2:45:05] ourselves.
[2:45:07] But oh God, when we needed a lamb, you
[2:45:11] came forth. When there was a cry for a
[2:45:14] kinsman redeemer, you came on the scene.
[2:45:17] You paid the price. You offered yourself
[2:45:20] in our place. And then you came and you
[2:45:22] took back all that was lost.
[2:45:26] God, furthermore, you cleansed us with
[2:45:28] your word and you came down to unite
[2:45:30] with us. And now, Lord, at the end time,
[2:45:34] you're offering that revelation to us.
[2:45:37] You're offering that revelation of
[2:45:39] yourself, that picture of redemption,
[2:45:42] and you're showing us our part in it,
[2:45:44] Lord. God, how unworthy we are, how
[2:45:47] incapable we ever were.
[2:45:50] But God, in you
[2:45:52] we find worthiness.
[2:45:55] In you we find redemption. In you we
[2:45:57] find a kinsman redeemer. In you we find
[2:46:00] our salvation.
[2:46:02] In you we find our righteousness. In you
[2:46:05] we find our worthiness.
[2:46:08] God I pray there's anyone here Lord who
[2:46:10] hasn't yet come to you to take the book.
[2:46:14] God, I pray that it would be it would
[2:46:17] move beyond mystery form and come down
[2:46:19] to a living reality in their life where
[2:46:21] they would come to you and you would
[2:46:23] share with them the purpose of
[2:46:25] redemption. And it's all been about them
[2:46:28] bringing your children back to yourself
[2:46:30] and back to the place that you
[2:46:32] predestinated,
[2:46:33] back to your original picture in Eden.
[2:46:35] And oh God, how grateful we are that you
[2:46:39] loved us so. Lord, we devote ourselves
[2:46:41] to you. We give ourselves to you. We
[2:46:43] love you. We reject the old headship of
[2:46:47] our first Adam for first birth, but we
[2:46:50] gladly run to and embrace and take the
[2:46:52] headship of the last Adam of our savior
[2:46:56] and bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:46:59] God bless your people. May this word be
[2:47:02] a living reality inside each one of us.
[2:47:05] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:47:10] Amen. God bless you, friends.
[2:47:14] Counselor,
[2:47:16] comforter, keeper,
[2:47:20] prayer and we long to embrace.
[2:47:26] You offer hope when our hearts
[2:47:32] hopeless be lost away.
[2:47:37] Oh, we hopeless be lost away.
[2:47:44] You are the one that we praise.
[2:47:50] You are the one we adore.
[2:47:55] You give the healing and grace.
[2:48:01] Hearts always hunger for.
[2:48:06] Oh our hearts always hunger for
[2:48:13] alm mighty infinite father
[2:48:18] faithfully loving your own.
[2:48:24] Here in our weakness you find
[2:48:29] us
[2:48:30] falling before your throne.
[2:48:34] Oh, we're falling before your throne.
[2:48:41] You are the one that we praise.
[2:48:47] You are the one we adore.
[2:48:53] You give the healing and grace
[2:48:57] of hearts always hunger.
[2:49:01] [Music]
[2:49:03] Oh, our hearts always hunger for once
[2:49:08] more. Oh, you are the one that we
[2:49:13] praise.
[2:49:16] You are the one we adore.
[2:49:21] You give the healing and grace
[2:49:26] our hearts always.
[2:49:29] [Music]
[2:49:31] Oh, our hearts always hunger for
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; the deed that came.
[2:49:40] This is what we have been taught
[2:49:46] by the prophet of God
[2:49:50] today.
[2:49:53] All the things that Adam lost
[2:50:00] now are available
[2:50:03] unto us.
[2:50:07] Heidentified
[2:50:10] the cloud that came as the deed to man
[2:50:17] again.
[2:50:21] And again,
[2:50:23] the deep and pain.
[2:50:29] Oh, this is what it's all about.
[2:50:36] Let's lift up our voices
[2:50:40] together and shout
[2:50:43] hallelu
[2:50:46] to our God
[2:50:50] who has redeemed us by his blood.
[2:50:57] By his blood
[2:51:00] the deep.
[2:51:03] [Music]
[2:51:06] Oh, this great mystery that was sealed
[2:51:13] in our day has been made so real.
[2:51:20] was the abstract titled
[2:51:25] [Music]
[2:51:27] the promise God made
[2:51:30] to Abraham's seed.
[2:51:34] Seven depths and seven steps
[2:51:41] that Christ may be formed in me.
[2:51:48] formed in me.
[2:51:51] The need that came.
[2:51:56] Oh, this is what it's all about.
[2:52:03] Let us lift up our voices
[2:52:06] together and shout
[2:52:10] hallelu
[2:52:13] to our God
[2:52:17] who's redeemed us by his blood.
[2:52:24] by his blood.
[2:52:28] [Music]
[2:52:32] Oh, and this is what it's all about.
[2:52:39] Let us lift up our voices
[2:52:43] together and shout
[2:52:45] [Music]
[2:52:46] hallelu
[2:52:49] to our God
[2:52:53] who has redeemed us by his blood.
[2:53:00] By his word,
[2:53:03] the deep.
[2:53:09] Here is love
[2:53:11] vast as the ocean.
[2:53:15] Loving kindness
[2:53:18] as the flood.
[2:53:22] When the prince
[2:53:24] of life, our ransom,
[2:53:28] shed for us,
[2:53:30] his preious blood,
[2:53:34] who his love
[2:53:37] will not remember,
[2:53:40] who can cease
[2:53:43] to sing his praise.
[2:53:46] He will never
[2:53:49] be forgotten.
[2:53:53] throughout heaven's
[2:53:56] eternal days.
[2:53:59] On the mount
[2:54:01] of crucifixion,
[2:54:05] fountains open
[2:54:08] and deep and wide.
[2:54:11] Through the floodgates
[2:54:14] of God's mercy
[2:54:17] float a vast
[2:54:20] and gracious tide.
[2:54:23] Grace and love
[2:54:26] like mighty rivers
[2:54:29] poured in
[2:54:32] from above.
[2:54:36] Heaven's peace
[2:54:38] and perfect justice.
[2:54:42] Kiss the guilty
[2:54:45] world in love.
[2:54:48] Let me all
[2:54:51] thy love accept me.
[2:54:54] Love me ever
[2:54:57] all my days.
[2:55:00] Let me seek
[2:55:03] thy kingom only
[2:55:07] and my life
[2:55:09] be to thy praise.
[2:55:13] Thou alone
[2:55:15] shall be my glory.
[2:55:19] Nothing in
[2:55:21] the world I see.
[2:55:25] Thou hast cleansed
[2:55:27] and sanctified me.
[2:55:31] Thou thyself
[2:55:33] hast set me free.
[2:55:37] In thy truth
[2:55:40] thou dost direct me.
[2:55:43] By thy spirit
[2:55:46] through thy word
[2:55:49] and thy grace
[2:55:52] my need is meeting
[2:55:56] as I trust
[2:55:58] in thee my Lord
[2:56:02] of thy fullness
[2:56:04] thou art pouring
[2:56:08] thy great love
[2:56:10] and power on me
[2:56:14] without measureful
[2:56:17] and boundless
[2:56:20] drawing out
[2:56:22] my heart to thee.
[2:56:26] Amazing
[2:56:29] grace,
[2:56:31] how sweet
[2:56:34] the sound
[2:56:37] that saved
[2:56:40] a rich
[2:56:43] like me.
[2:56:48] I once
[2:56:51] was lost
[2:56:54] but now
[2:56:57] I'm found.
[2:57:00] Was blind
[2:57:03] but now
[2:57:05] I see.
[2:57:10] Oh, was grace
[2:57:14] that taught
[2:57:17] my heart
[2:57:20] to fear
[2:57:23] and grace
[2:57:25] my fears
[2:57:28] relieved.
[2:57:31] [Music]
[2:57:34] How precious
[2:57:37] did
[2:57:39] that grace
[2:57:42] appear?
[2:57:46] out.
[2:57:48] I first
[2:57:50] believe
[2:57:56] through many
[2:57:58] [Music]
[2:57:59] dangerous
[2:58:02] toys to
[2:58:05] snares.
[2:58:07] I have
[2:58:10] already
[2:58:13] come.
[2:58:18] His grace
[2:58:21] hath brought
[2:58:23] me safe
[2:58:26] thus far.
[2:58:29] and grace
[2:58:31] will lead
[2:58:34] me home.
[2:58:39] Oh, when we've
[2:58:42] been there
[2:58:45] 10,000
[2:58:49] years,
[2:58:51] bright shineing
[2:58:54] as
[2:58:56] the sun.
[2:59:02] We've no
[2:59:04] less days
[2:59:07] to sing
[2:59:10] God's praise
[2:59:12] than when
[2:59:15] we first
[2:59:18] beun.
[2:59:23] Praise God.
[2:59:26] Praise God.
[2:59:29] Praise God.
[2:59:31] Praise God.
[2:59:34] Praise God.
[2:59:37] Praise God.
[2:59:40] Praise God.
[2:59:45] Praise God.
[2:59:48] Praise God.
[2:59:50] Praise God.
[2:59:53] Praise God.
[2:59:56] Praise God.
[2:59:58] Praise God.
[3:00:01] Praise God.
[3:00:06] Oh, the Lord
[3:00:09] has promised
[3:00:13] good
[3:00:15] to me.
[3:00:18] His word,
[3:00:20] my hope
[3:00:23] secures.
[3:00:26] [Music]
[3:00:28] He will
[3:00:31] my shield
[3:00:34] and portion
[3:00:37] be
[3:00:39] as long
[3:00:41] as life
[3:00:44] endures.
[3:00:46] [Music]
[3:00:49] Oh, the Lord
[3:00:52] has promised
[3:00:56] good
[3:00:58] to me.
[3:01:00] His word,
[3:01:03] my hope
[3:01:06] secures.
[3:01:11] He will
[3:01:13] my shield
[3:01:16] and portion
[3:01:19] be
[3:01:22] as long
[3:01:24] as life
[3:01:27] and
[3:01:29] [Music]
[3:02:08] Heat. Heat.
[3:02:13] [Music]
[3:03:39] [Music]
[3:04:13] [Music]
[3:04:39] Lord
[3:04:41] glory.
