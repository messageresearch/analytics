them lord for we know that you are faithful while we come lord here with joy in our hearts to sing your praises to rejoice in your goodness for the hour that we live in is a great hour lord much that you're accomplishing now and lord may it be accomplished in us may we trust in you more day by day and may we glorify your name more and more and lord may we display your attributes in our life as time goes on more and more we pray to take this service into your hand that you would take me into your hand and use this vessel lord to preach your words of eternal life for god we're depending on you but you're faithful i'll take every word and plant it into our heart lord may your word grow from us and produce a life lord your life on display again we love you father we ask the blessings over all that's said are done in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you while you're standing let's take our bibles and go to psalms 46. and then i just want to mention that we had the funeral service here yesterday for sister lou mcnulty and it was a nice service and appreciate all those who were able to come out and it went really well also i want to remind you that this afternoon we have the communion service and feet washing here so i'll announce that again at the end of service amen let's look at psalms 46 and verse 1. god is our refuge and strength a very present help and trouble i want you to pay close attention to psalms 46 because it's really interesting as we read this but it this this scripture has become to mean a lot to me over the last couple of days have i studied this god is our refuge and our strength and a very present help and a very present help in trouble therefore will i not will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea talk about fearful things these are fearful things but because god is our refuge and strength and very present help and trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god what is the city of god the new jerusalem the bride so read this with that understanding there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacle of the most high god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her in that right early amen god bless you as you take your seats amen i want to take from there a subject of a present help in the time of trouble a present help in the time of trouble amen and to see that that god is in the midst of her this city this tabernacle of the most high this dwelling place of god god is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved god shall help her in that right early because of this though the though the earth be removed though the mountains be cast into the sea that the waters roar we shall not fear i mean that's the thing that is is just heavy in my heart that god is training us god is teaching us in this age that he is in absolute complete control of all things and that there will be a bride on this earth who is not driven by fear manipulated by fear moved around running around all these things by fear but there will be a bride who will be planted upon a rock amen and she will know that she is planted upon the rock and though the waves v bietmanly against this vehemently against this house amen the house will not be moved because we are not on the shifting sands of man's ideology amen of doctrines of man and denominational understanding but we are on the solid rock of jesus christ the revelation of the entire bible has been unfolded in this day and his bride is planted on that rock amen and no matter what happens with the storms it's amazing that when jesus uses this parable of typing two houses built on two surfaces one on the sand and one upon the rock amen they both received the same storm and this is something that i just i want to take note of amen the the man who who did not heed the words of the lord and build his house upon the sand amen he had the same waves the same storm the same waters that beat against his house and beat it down amen the one who who heeded the words of christ and obeyed them amen he built his house upon the rock and received the same storm as the other man did so it's not as though we can say i'm the bride of jesus christ i have supernatural protection that is true but it doesn't mean the wave will not beat against your house amen it doesn't mean the storm will not come and the wave will not beat against your house but you've been planted upon the rock of christ jesus amen and your house will not be moved the other house will be moved so we we can no longer amen live in a fairy tale and pretend that i'm the bride of jesus christ no trouble will come trouble will come storms will come waves will beat vehemently against your house amen beat vehemently that's serious against your house but it won't move not because of you but because of the rock you're on so we it to me it's so helpful sometimes to to keep things in perspective amen and and that we don't uh we don't allow some of the the things that we understand to be true that we don't take it in carnal ways and go into the wrong direction with with our own carnal understanding and interpretation of things and think that because we're the bride of jesus christ no trouble will come no sometimes because you're the bride of jesus christ trouble will come and that that there'll be no suffering because that's not the scriptures the scripture says that you'll reign with him if you suffer with him so there's no way of escaping those things but the scripture says he is a present help in the time of trouble and i just begin to look at this differently he's a present help in the time of trouble and then psalms 46 that we just read verse 1 said a very present help in trouble and how much we long for the presence of the lord to be present with us and to make himself known but the scriptures promised that that'll happen in a time of trouble but we never want to have trouble but we want the presence of god and for him to show himself mighty but we never want trouble but the scripture's promised that in trouble he'll be present and show himself mighty so do we want him to be present show himself mighty but we spend all of our time especially as americans we spend all of our time guarding ourselves against trouble no trouble no problems we want to be financially secure we want insurance for everything we want a backup plan we want electric off the grid and a backup generator and a kerosene heater and a bunch of canned goods in the basement we're always trying to take care of ourselves amen but god has promised that when the trouble comes amen i'll be a very present help let's turn to uh psalms 34 and read another scripture here we've been talking about the testimony last sunday we were talking about the testimony that that out of revelation chapter 12 verse 11 when it says that they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony that these individuals that have overcome the devil have a testimony amen and and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and we talked about that word testimony is the same word as witness they're giving witness and their witness is part of the condemnation of the devil amen that because of their testimony because of their witness they have overcome him so it's not just something that happens afar off and it's already done for us but no we overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony so we must have a testimony to overcome the devil with we must be able to testify witness that this word works amen and how do we witness that this word works when we get in all kinds of situations and difficulties and trials and tribulations and the word overcomes every single one of them sickness comes the word overcomes amen troubles come the word overcomes amen all kinds of afflictions come and the word overcomes and when the word overcomes in our life we have a testimony we now can witness i can stand and say i have seen the word overcome that situation in my life i have seen this word amen that you're that you are doubting this word that the devil is trying to to condemn god on not keeping his word he's kept it in my life that word works the next time there's a there's a conflict over the word somebody else can stand and i want to be a witness that word works because i was in this situation but you have to understand in order to be the witness you've got to be willing to go through the trouble amen that first the problem has to come so that the word can rise up and conquer that problem so that you can overcome by the word or the word can overcome through you so that you can stand on that day and says the word works it'll overcome depression it'll overcome the anxiety it overcomes amen the problems from my past the neglects and abuses that carried through with me through life the word overcame that sickness was overcome by the word i had a financial need amen and the word says amen that god will provide all of my needs in the word works but you see what was the condition leading to the testimony a lot of trouble psalms 34 17. psalms 34 and 17 the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save us such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all now do we believe this scripture then we shouldn't get so confused over our many afflictions when one problem comes and we get over that and another problem comes and when the devil comes and whispers in ear and it tries to bring confusion because the amount of opposition and difficulty in our lives is how can you be the bride of christ and have so much trouble but the is telling us that this is the condition of the righteous many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all so the scripture in verse 18 i want to spend a moment on is the lord is nine to them that are of a broken heart and save us such as be of a contrite spirit this word contrite is is literally means dust in the scripture and it has a sister word that's spelled the same pronounced different that means to be broken or to be shattered amen so this word dust is really broken down to dust amen when you're broken down with your of a contrite spirit your spirit is broken down to dust and so god it says the lord is nine to them that are of a broken heart and save us such as be of a contrite spirit and and i would venture to say i'm not the only person in here that works overtime not to be broken and broken into dust i mean that's not i don't try to put myself in that position to be broken to bits to be broken-hearted and to have my spirit broken into dust i don't intentionally wake up in the morning and try to go find some difficulty to put myself into so i'll be broken but the scripture says that he draws nigh to them that are broken-hearted and i'm always asking god to draw nigh unto me but he's promised that when i'm brokenhearted he draws nigh unto me and so we always want we our desire as human beings our makeup is always to avoid the very thing that brings his presence so close and the very thing that brings the manifestation of his word so evident in our lives amen god has become so real to me and i've seen god move in supernatural ways how many of you have had a supernatural move of god that you know god came on the scene and if it wasn't for god you wouldn't have got out of it okay i want to ask you was that movement of god that testimony you have was that coming at a time of peace and tranquility and blessing or was it coming at a time of trouble and tribulation difficulty amen impossible circumstances it's not you know it's not as though when all is well and we're skipping down the road amen that we're watching the magnificent mighty things have gone but it's when troubles come amen that there's a word to counter that trouble amen when difficulties come there's a promise to overcome that difficulty and so god is manifesting himself in our lives amen one trouble after another and he's promised to draw nigh unto them that are brokenhearted and so we we avoid the very thing that when we look back on are the highlights of our walk with the lord when we read through the bible and we have all of these stories all of these heroes of faith and all of these great accomplishments that were done for the glory of god and for the kingdom of god when you go back and you read the lives of all of these men through the bible and what we would call testimonies through the bible or miraculous works of god and i would ask you how many of those came in the face of adversity and trial and difficulty i think almost all i don't want to say all but i would say almost all when when we talk about amen uh the overcoming of samson well i mean it was difficult friends that was not an easy situation that samson was in he was captive his eyes were plucked out he was grinding in the mill he had to repent and be broken-hearted and contrite amen and in his broken heartedness and his contriteness over his sin god brings the greatest victory in his entire life and we look back at the look at that as samson he killed more in his death than he killed in his life but we don't realize that it was at contrition it was brokenheartedness it means through difficulty imprisonment he was cast completely and utterly down that god came in such a supernatural way we can go story after story after story through the bible and in our lives we could go around the room in story after story after story after story but i hope that we begin to realize that he's a present help in the time of trouble jesus told his disciples in john 16 he said these things i have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation jesus said it in the world you shall have tribulation that's a sure word from the lord but he says but be of good cheer i have overcome the world this word tribulation is translated tribulation or affliction most of the time it's also translated translated trouble or anguish or persecution or burden in the description it means oppressing a pressing together a pressure an oppression affliction tribulation distress or straights that's what jesus was saying to his disciples you will have in this world you will have pressures you will have pressings you will have affliction tribulation distresses you will have straights but be of good cheer cheer i have overcome the world there's a problem coming but i've already provided the solution to the problem don't worry problems are coming but there's already a solution to the problem and i can stand here today and i can i can i can faithfully say that that troubles are coming they've been they're happening they will be but be of good cheer the solution has already went forth he has overcome the world let's turn together to isaiah 57. i feel like i'm preaching backwards i preached on your testimony now i'm talking about how you make a testimony i thought maybe i should have handled this first but maybe not maybe in the in the lord's wisdom he knew we needed to be excited about being a witness i want to be a witness i want to stand on that day and you know last sunday i said brother bam said now i could like to call i got time for one more witness if it's all right i'd like to take the stand i said who else would like to take and you all raised your hand so now we're talking about how you get to the place where you can take the stand so since we've already volunteered this is the perfect message now but be of good cheer i've overcome the world there is nothing for us to be afraid of i say that over and over but i have to say it to encourage myself because i find that all when troubles come and uncertainties arise i fear that all fear come back to me so i have to say it over and over not for you i have to say it over and over for me there's nothing to be afraid of [Music] there's if god is still on the throne amen if i'm still in the palm of his hand there is nothing to be afraid of fearful things happen but there's nothing for me to be afraid of isaiah 57 15 isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place now don't read any further please this is the high and lofty one who dwells in the high and holy place okay we're going to see an absolute contradictory statement but it's not going to change god's dwelling place he dwells high and lifted up in the holy place now let's continue reading together i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit the high and holy one lives in the holy place with those that are humble and broken the high and the low come together in the humble in contrite i dwell in the high and holy place with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones praise god brother branham in the message of the rapture he begins with the scripture out of psalms 27 we know it quite well and we're going to read it we can go ahead and turn there to psalms 27 but it's interesting what brother ben says in the beginning of the rapture when he's coming to this he wants to preach on the rapture and he starts with an unlikely scripture in most of our thinking at the time and and here's what he says about that he says i want to speak on the subject of the rapture this is right in the beginning of the message now we believe that there will be a rapture all christians believe that that's bible readers believes that there will be a rapture and now to read for some background so brother branham's going to read this is what he's going to read out of psalms 27 is the background to the rapture so now i want to read for some background we read the 27th psalm uh one to five one to five verse so now when brother branham is going to preach on the uh on the rapture he wants to lay this scripture as a background or the setting or the background around the rapture so we want to catch what he's what he's thinking and what his purpose is in reading this and he reads the first five verses but i'd like to read the whole chapter psalms 27 verse 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid this is the background to the rapture message he's trying to get the church to realize what our position and condition is and what our attitude should be the lord is my light and my salvation of whom shall i be afraid amen listen it was not this is he's not giving us this scripture amen to tell us everything is going to be so good in the background of this rapture amen that you have no reason to fear he's telling you there's everything around you will cause you to fear but you're not to be afraid he's not bringing this because there's no reason to be afraid amen nothing's happening everything's going fine i mean hunky dory everything's good amen the bride has come to the place where she's coasting do you believe the bride's gonna come to the place where she's just coasting but he says this is the background the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear uh the lord of the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a whole should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide in me he shall set me up upon a rock brother branham reads these first five verses and he says i want to read on i want to preach on the rapture and i want to read this as a background all my enemies are gathered around me but i'll not be afraid though the foes want to eat up my flesh listen those are times that bring human beings fear those are troubling times those are difficult times those are circumstances that create anxiety and create fear and create all kinds of uncertainty amen but we see a contrast here in david and the most uncertain time and the greatest anxiety and fear he has the greatest peace and he says one thing will i seek after i'm not worried about how to get rid of these enemies i'm not worried about how to save myself i'm not worried about my escape route there's only one thing i want when all the foes gather about me and they want to eat up my flesh and everything's come against me to destroy me only one thing i'm interested and that's the dwell in the house of the lord all my life he took his focus off of the enemies his focus off of the troubles all around him and has put his focus on one thing i want to be where you are i want to dwell in your house i want to be in the secret of your pavilion and the hidden place in the inner chamber of your tabernacle i want to be with you you and me alone in the secret place in the little tabernacle david amen what a lesson for all of us in the troubling times amen that he didn't say oh god how will i get through here should i use this passage how will i overcome he in in this scenario in this situation he only wanted one thing let's read it again verse 3 again though a host shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple make that our primary focus let us all make that our primary focus and our primary goal and not worried so much about all the things going on around us but let's focus on this and i believe it'll bring peace to our hearts i'm going to continue reading for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yeah i will sing praises unto the lord oh i love this scripture friends he's saying one thing i've inquired amen that's that's the dwell in the house of the lord and inquire in his temple and now he's lifted my head above my enemies that's he's brought me to a greater understanding to a greater revelation than all my enemies and when i come in a greater revelation and he lifts my head above the head of all of my enemies amen this is not just an elevated place amen he's bringing him to a greater level of understanding a greater level of revelation and with that greater level of revelation he says i will sing i will bring sacrifices of joy i will sing praises to the lord his enemies haven't gone anywhere and their desire to destroy him hasn't changed his circumstance hasn't changed but his understanding what's changed david's changed amen he was his head was lifted up above his enemies and when his head was lifted up above his enemies he realized amen the devil can do nothing to me unless it first crosses god's desk and god signs off on it that nothing's out of kilter everything's ticking just right on time what is that that's david having his head lifted above his enemies that is you and i in the time of trouble having our head lifted above our enemies that we know that god has appointed the day of my birth god has appointed the day of my death that god has a purpose in my life and nothing shall take my life until that purpose is finished and what is that that is god lifting your head above your enemies and then you can say this too shall work to the glory of god whatever my situation or whatever my trouble let's keep reading verse 7 hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou says seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek i not thy face far from me but put not thy servant away in anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me oh god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord god comes to those he draws nigh to them that are a broken heart and and and david says wait on the lord be of courage and he shall strengthen thy heart so when your heart is broken wait on the lord and he shall strengthen your heart those are the ones he comes to you in and i love in verse 13 when he says i had fainted and lest i had believed we have to believe that we will see the goodness of the lord in the land of the men that this too shall work together for good that god has a plan for my life and nothing coming against me amen can work outside of god's plan in my life amen and i we have to believe that that will see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living brotherhood says in the message i have heard but now i see from 1965 he said now sometimes these great pulsations of faith come right in the time of crisis it's usually crisis that drives us into this it was a crisis that drove job into it why he was at the end of his life his children was dead his camels and all of his goods he was gone and destroyed in his own life he was broke out from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet with boils it was a crisis that he that he pressed himself there's where the inspiration struck him amen how many of you can say in your lives it was times of crisis that have become your testimonies times of crisis have become my testimonies i can stand on that day as a witness and my witness will overcome the devil because at a time of crisis the word worked amen god came on the scene he kept his word and the word worked i am a witness today because of a crisis i'm a witness because of difficulties i'm a witness because of pain and suffering i stand today as a witness let's go to genesis chapter 32. so we know no trial no test no trial and no test equals no testimony so how can you overcome with no testimony so we have to have a testimony and you know what we not collectively individually have to have a testimony that's one of my questions last week is the same question what is your testimony not the prophet's testimony not the preacher's testimony not my dad or my mom or are the great saints that were before us amen we we are following in the trail of many who have blazed the blazed away and they seem supernatural absolutely supernatural things have gone and i enjoy hearing all their testimonies but their testimony is not my overcoming i overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony that i individually must have a testimony amen i have to have a time when the word worked in my life when when the word worked when god overcome in my life that i have something that i can stand i can't stand as an eyewitness and give other people's accounts i was not an eyewitness so i can't give second-hand information amen in a legal proceeding in accord i can't say well my neighbor i mean it happened to them and so i believe my neighbor no they bring a witness that has first-hand account amen an eyewitness who knows what they're talking about amen an eyewitness that experienced that that that can give a testimony in court amen and i don't want to stand amen in the in the great courts of god to condemn the devil and try to keep talking about what everybody else did and what happened in the prophet's life then what happened in the great saints that went before i said no but i want to give a testimony of my own amen i want to stand and say i this happened in my life and god came down and did this and i was in this situation and this came against me and god came down and do this and i want to stand and testify that the word is true that god keeps his word and the devil is a liar but we each have to have our own testimony amen so no test no trial no testimony i i hope that we can get to the place i don't know that i'm there but i hope that we can get to the place where we learn to embrace what god is sending our way for our benefit and for the glory of god that i want to get to the place just me personally i want to get to the place where i stop panicking when i see something beginning to happen when i go to enter into a trial and all the circumstances are stacked i want to get to the place where my initial reaction is not panic and fear i want to be able to stop and say all things are in god's control and i'm in the palm of his hand and not his mind about me has not changed and none of his word has changed just because these new circumstances i want to get to the place where i can just hesitate for a moment and say this is for my good and for the glory of god the devil will be defeated god will be magnified the word will work in this situation like every other one that i faced i don't know why it is that i have not got to that level of maturity yet but i get to the place where when we see something happening all of a sudden you know the blood pressure goes up heart starts beating fast you get this anxiety can't sleep at night you know the big storm's brewing and something really bad's happening if god isn't going to come on the scene it's all going to fall apart and and and we know god's going to come on the scene we can look back over our whole life amen and god's going to come and say we can read the whole bible god's going to take care of us amen i want to get to the place where i do not let this flesh dominate me amen but the inner man begins to dominate this flesh say hold on a minute nothing's out of control here everything's all right let's look at genesis 32 verse 9. this is jacob when he's returning back to the land he's leaving laban he has his wives and his children and his cattle and his servants and he's heading back and he says and jacob said oh god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which says unto me return unto thy country into thy kindred and i will deal well with thee i am not worthy of the least of all thy the mercies and of all the truth which thou has shown unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan now i am become two bands deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and and the mother and the children and thou says i will surely do the good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude so now jacob is coming back but he gets word that his brother's coming to meet him with 400 servants and he fears for his life because he cheated his brother he got him got the birthright from him and he stole the blessing and so he's done wrong to his brother now his brother's coming back and he's fearful and he's in a straight he's in a press he's in a trial he's in a difficult situation and he cries out to god and when he cries out to god he starts to remind god of the promises that god made him that you told me out of my seed there shall be the seed as the sands and you told me and the promises to me and he's reminding god of the word that god promised to him and he's telling god i'm fearful god help me and deliver me from my brother but when the deliverance comes it's not exactly maybe what jacob expected and let's look at verse 24 and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask for my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place pineal for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over epinewell the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh and to this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh and the sin knew that shrank jacob is in a straight he's in a difficult situation he's fearing for his life and he cries out to god and reminds god of the promise and god's answer to his promise was to deliver him but god's answer to jacob's problem was also to change jacob and we realized that god has made promises to us that he will deliver us and there's no testimony without a test the trial produces the the opportunity to witness of god's goodness but god is always accomplishing multiple things in every trial and in every situation and here jacob amen he's of a certain nature he's got the birthright he's got the promise he's went and he's cheated his brother and then he gets cheated by laban but he also kind of works his own deal there and he comes back into the land amen and and his brother he's fearful his brother's going to come kill him that god now has jacob right where he wants jacob amen you realize that god could have come to him in the form of an angelic being a man and wrestled with him any time he wanted god could have done it amen when he was in bethel amen sleeping with his head upon a rock amen and he saw the ladder of god and the angels coming up and down he could have done it when he was in laban's house he could god could have come to him any time to touch him amen but god waited till jacob got pressed into a corner that jacob got down into desperation to jacob got to where he really needed god amen and none of his little shenanigans were going to work this time that he couldn't use a credit card he couldn't borrow from grandma anymore he couldn't go get another job oh we think times are different times are the same he couldn't he couldn't work it out on his own anymore he couldn't put himself on top anymore he couldn't work another deal amen all of his deal making was done all of us taking advantage was done he got into a situation where he was pressed and now he became desperate now he had to have god and he had to have god keep his word and there was nothing that jacob could do about it and when jacob got into that condition god come on the scene because god wanted not just to deliver jacob god wanted to change jacob and in this situation god could like i said god could have come to him any time he wanted to but god comes at this time amen there's so many things that happen to us friends that shape us that make us to mold us and some of some of our greatest shaping times come in the worst times of our life at times of great loss or great separation or or times that our heart is absolutely broken god could come to us at any time any time god could come and we pray all the time god changed me god mold me god make me more like you uh we pray that all the time and that's our harsh desire to be molded but sometimes the molding has to take place under intense pressure amen and when we come under intense pressure god is going to come on the scene because he wants to shape us in a certain way and we got to get to a place where now we're crying out and now nothing else will work you're the only option that i've got plan b is fail plan c is fail plan a has failed you're the only option i've got gone and god is working more than just keeping his word for jacob he is molding jacob to have the character that he needs to have to be one of the patriarchs of the nation so god comes down and presents himself to jacob but he doesn't make it easy on jacob jacob has to wrestle with him and he says let me go i'll not let you go and we've preached on all this we know the the whole situation but it wasn't a hand me it wasn't a give me it wasn't that god came down and god stood there and said here's your present with a pretty bow open it up this is your deliverance but jacob had to sweat it out jacob had to wrestle it out why because god was trying to get something out of jacob because jacob was intended to go back into the land he the blessing was with him the promise was with him amen he had the birthright the nation was coming through him but he had to be changed in order to fulfill god's purpose in his life and god used the press of the situation to bring about the circumstances for his change and when he got desperate then he became broken and in the wrestling with god when he was wrestling with god god broke him jacob wasn't wrestling with this man and fell over and hid his leg on a rock the angel touched his leg and broke him would god do that he still does he still does and from that day on jacob never walked the same way again i tell you friends i've had times in my life where god broke me broke me and i've not been the same since i'm not the same person that i used to be and it wasn't all the it wasn't all the joyous happy times and the birthday parties and the ice cream and cake that changed me it was sweating it out with god it was it was praying in agony for god to change the situation it was really wrestling around saying god i'm in a great need now and things would happen that would just absolutely break me but they broke me in a good way it broke my pride and broke my self-reliance and broke my arrogance and broken broken broke amen and i don't walk the same way that i used to walk in this world i'm much different than i used to be but god himself broke me and he may look to others like maybe i limp a little bit amen maybe emotionally i'm not as strong and i'm not as confident as i used to be and i and i'm not as bold amen there may be a little bit of an emotional limp there but i tell you it's the best thing that has ever happened in my life because now when you see me walk and i'm a little slow to judge and a little hesitant they meant to say something and and i'm a little bit softer than i used to be not as bold and not as brash and i got just a little bit i meant of a slow step i say thank god amen that he knew how to break me amen to make me what he wanted me to be it comes at great testing times great pressures god is not destroying us he's molding us the next time you get into a great trial a tribulation and somebody feels sorry for you sometimes they don't feel sorry for me god's perfecting me if we could just change our attitude if we could just look at circumstances oh what i pray for all the time is i quit looking at things through carnal eyes and i start flying like an eagle and looking at the perspective from above and from above the whole situation looks different when you get above you realize i've been putting my confidence in the wrong thing i've been hoping for the wrong thing i i've been i've been trusting in the wrong thing when you get a little bit higher you realize none of those things will work amen god is working something out of me and when when i come through this like job said amen though he tried me yet shall i come forth like gold because god's going to accomplish something in my life uh brother branham said in the message desperations 1963 he said now jacob knew that his life was close at the end he had a messenger come and told him that his brother with 400 armed men was coming to meet him note he he was on his road fear took a hold of him he sent man ahead with an ox and cattle and sheep to make a peace offering with esau then after that he started with another group with another load of stuff then he started another group with another load of stuff trying to meet him first to try to turn his wrath then he got to thinking that won't stop him because he's probably richer than i am he doesn't need it then he took his wives and his little children and set them across that esau would see the little children and his wives and surely on his own little nieces and nephews he would not slay them then he still he couldn't do it god knows how to get a man listen to that statement god knows how to get a man jacob crossed the brook i want to i just say it this way was esau coming for jacob or was god coming for jacob god knows how to get a man remember these pieces are just pawns on god's chessboard he's moving us into position he's molding us into character he's shaping us he's he's moving us around the board with these circumstances and it wasn't esau coming to get jacob god was just using esau as a pawn he would now move him to this spot and then and jacob would move men this way and men this way and get and he would bring esau a little closer and then finally jacob couldn't take it no more so he jumped across the brook and got off by himself and god said that's what i was waiting for that last move worked amen that last move got him just where i wanted him out away from all of his confidence away from everybody else all by himself and now i'm going to come and i'm going to touch him you're a song that song he touched me when jacob sang it he sang it different than you sing it he touched me and changed me he touched me and broke me amen and i'm different than what i was god knows how to get a man jacob crossed a brook there he got down on his knees you know he had kind of been a little shyster before that excuse the expression but kind of he was a jacob means a deceiver and that's what he was but there's something had to happen to him there in desperation there when death laid before him there may be men and women sitting here tonight that death lays right before you and the only way that you'll ever be able to achieve the thing that you're waiting wanting is to desperately come i must have it tonight i get it now or i'm finished tomorrow is too late i must have it now when you pray for the baptism of the holy spirit the token don't say well now i'll go up and try lord i'm a little tired oh have mercy stay in your seat don't even don't even make an attempt if you come say i'll pass through the prayer line put the oil on my head i'll see if it does mean any good might as well sit where you're at until you get to a place until the whole church gets to a place that is between death and life you've got to have it now or perish then god will move on the scene it takes desperation to bring god on the scene and god knows how to get a man you know we pray we pray every day because we're christians but god knows how to get us to pray god knows how to move us into a position in the circumstances where we really get down and seek god where we cry out in desperation where we need him and nothing else will work god knows how to get us to pray amen let's look at psalms 37. psalms 37 and 39. psalms 37 and 39 but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him he is your strength in time of trouble don't be afraid of the time of trouble let's let's resolve in our hearts today with god's help to no longer fear the time of trouble because he is my strength in the time of trouble so i need a time of trouble to display his strength it's all god showing himself let's go to hebrews 11. i referred to this but i'd like to read it together hebrews chapter 11 is many times called the the chapter of the heroes of faith and it's a record of many of the old testament saints and what they've done but i'm just going to take a quick snippet from the end of this and verse 32 hebrews chapter 11 verse 32 says what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and the jephthah of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faiths of new kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheepskin and ghostkins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and indents the caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect these are the heroes of the faith the heroes of the faith had to have faith to overcome their circumstances that's what made them heroes of the faith because it was the faith in god in his word that brought them through a multitude of circumstances we just read those this this wasn't these men and women didn't have easy life and it wasn't the easy part of life that has them put in hebrews 11. it wasn't the easy part you know not every day is terrible we have some good days we have some blessed days we have some days where we take where we take a walk and we see the the creation that god has made is still even in its fallen condition still has god's fingerprint in it you see a mountain range and a sunset and and and you know different things like that brother branham said he heard a wolf howl and he heard an elk bugle and he said that just does something to me and there's days that there's a blessings of the lord and there's days that that good things are are happening to you but many times it's those good and wonderful things are not the anchor points in your life or not the things that you have a testimony about and certainly not what put these individuals in hebrews 11 you have to say how did they get into hebrews chapter 11. they got into hebrews chapter 11 by believing in the face of all kinds of trials and tribulations by believing in the faith face of terrible circumstances having faith believing god standing upon his word when all the cards were stacked against them when all the circumstances amen were up against them that's what got them in the hebrews chapter 11. and if i'm ever going to be in a record like hebrews chapter 11 it's not going to be the blue bird sky days amen when the warm sunshine's on my face and everything's well with me that gets me to hebrews 11 amen those are blessings of god and we cherish each one of those they strengthen us amen but but the real the real pressing the real trial brings the character of god out and brings the word of god to pass in my life and if i'll ever get into a record like hebrews 11 somewhere in the records of heaven i'll be there because of difficult days terrible circumstances trials and tribulations praise be to god in isaiah 40 i'll just read it to you in isaiah chapter 40 verse 29 he says he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the you shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint he giveth power to who the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength i think this is why jesus when he was talking with his disciples and they were asking who was greatest in the kingdom of god he took a little child and he said it in their midst he said unless you become like this little child why because god wants to show himself mighty he does not want to show how mighty you are so he takes the weak things of the world he takes the things that are not he thinks the things that are outcast and set aside and weak and unable he takes those things the child the children of the world and he does mighty things so that everybody will know it's not that child it's god there was a boy who had a few loaves and a few fishes amen and those loaves and fishes fed 5 000 it wasn't the boy it was god who took what he had and multiplied it and god will take things in circumstances like that over and over that's why when god was choosing his disciples amen he chose wisely he chose illiterate chose fishermen chose people with no ability no ability to start a church no ability to convince other people to believe in a set of doctrine they ran illiterate fishermen i bought a fish off of him in the market yesterday amen and a week later or months later or years later he's the one preaching the the present tense truth of god and the only way that i will get to god because that man has the key is the same one who smelled like fish two years ago that's why brother brown said the way up is down the way up is down is not brother ben's statement the way up is down is the whole bible and so god he's not you know uh i think sometimes we get the wrong idea that if i'm going to be the bride of jesus christ and christ is going to be manifest in my flesh that i've got to be strong and i've got to be power and show his might but don't forget that he's describing you in the feminine you're a woman you're not supposed to be the one with all the power and the might and the strength you're supposed to be relying on your husband to do all of that you're supposed to be confident in him you're supposed to have faith in him you're supposed to be even bold in your declaration because it's him don't forget that god describes you in the feminine and he also describes you as sheep and tells you that you have to be like a child so you have to be a sheep a woman and a child to be great in the kingdom of god amen amen so i think many times we've tried to prove how that we're the bride by whatever antics and testimonies and being loud and forceful and and and yelling and saying boastful things i don't know but i think he's looking for the humble the contrite the one who doesn't have it figured out and the one who doesn't have all the answers and the one who can just be like a child and say i don't know but my father knows a child who can say i i don't know i'm not strong enough to move that boulder but i'll go get my dad and my dad can move it or you know when the devil's pushing you around and you say i if you keep pushing me i'm going to call my dad so that it never becomes i'm the bride and i'm strong it becomes i'm the bride and i'm connected to the strengths i'm married to the mighty one i i am i am a prized possession of the one who who created the heavens and the earth i'm the prized possession of the one amen who can count who can cast out the devil with his finger it's not so much my power it's his power in me it's not my might his might and me but his strength comes to those who are faint his strength doesn't come to those who are strong the bible doesn't say i come to strengthen the strong i come to make mighty the mighty i come to those who are brokenhearted i draw nine of them that are brokenhearted i save those out of a contrite spirit amen i i i become strength for those that are faint so when we face obstacles that we don't have answers for we don't have to get afraid and we don't have to start yelling threats and start you know i mean we don't have to act like we're strong all we have to do is say i don't have the answer to this but my husband does i don't know what's happening job got to a place he says i look to the left and i can't find him i look to the right and i see him not forwarded he's not there backwards and i cannot discern him he's saying i have no idea where god's at and i have no idea what god's doing job had nothing figured out but after he said that he said but this i know that when i am tried i shall come forth as gold i don't have it figured out i don't know the answers i don't know why this is happening to me but i know who i am and i know who he is amen and i know that i'm connected by my a supernatural line to the mighty one amen to the conqueror to the undefeatable god of heavens and earth i'm connected amen eternally to him i was in his thoughts before i'm here for his purpose so i don't have to worry about it as long as i know that i'm here serving his purpose he is going to come on the scene and deliver me and he will keep his word [Music] that i can be confident amen let's turn to john chapter 9. i want to look at two reasons that trials come our way and there's more than two reasons there's multitudes of things that god does with every trial every circumstance in our life is multifaceted it's accomplishing several things in the kingdom of god everything is so intertwined and interlaced i don't think we'll ever figure out all that's god doing in every circumstance but there's two things that i want to look at the first is god is displaying his attributes in our trials and our tribulations god is going to come on the scene and he's going to prove his word he's going to display his attributes so our trials is all about him showing himself and let's look at this in john chapter 9 verse 1 and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him why is he blind because god wants to show his attributes why was he born blind because god wants to manifest himself so let's read it again he says neither hath this man sin nor his parents the question is why was he born blind who sinned he said nobody sinned that's not the reason he was born blind the reason he was born blind is that the works of god should be made manifest in him there's a lot of things that happen to us that we ask why why was i born this way why did i have these parents why did i come through these circumstances why did i have this trial why why why why and many times the question could be because god wants to manifest himself why was i born and neglected why was i my parents didn't love me why was it that i was abused as a child why do i have these scars from the past maybe so god can have a witness on that day that can stand up when somebody says i can never serve god because my dad abused me and abandoned me you could stand up and say but my dad abused and abandoned me but god was mighty on my behalf and the word worked one could stand up and say i couldn't serve god because you know i had a spouse and they wouldn't serve god and any time i tried to go to church any time i tried to believe the message or listen to it they were always against me and always and somebody else will be able to stand up and say i had a spouse who didn't believe and they were cantankerous and they were hateful but i found that there's a friend that sticketh closer than the brother that god would come to me and comfort me and encourage me and god gave me the ability to overcome that trial why are you in the situation here why were you born the way you were born why do you start with what you struggle with why amen maybe it's so god can show himself mighty on your behalf so that god can display his attributes brother branham said in the message why we are not a denomination from 1958 why which was first a savior or a sinner which was first a savior which was first a healer or a sick person why was there permitted to be a sinner because the attributes of him is a savior if there had never been a sinner he had never been known as a savior hallelujah he can make all things wind around to his glory can the potter say or can the pot say to the potter you made me thus who's on the wheel who's got the clay whose hands is in it paul said oh foolish man didn't he say he'd raise pharaoh up for this very purpose certainly he knew it before there was a world he knowed who would be what and he let there be sin that he might be a savior why why did god let me amen go so far in sin why didn't he you know we we think these things all the time you know why do i have so many scars from living in sin why did i do so much why did i go so far well god could have stopped me anytime why didn't he stop me before maybe god wanted to show how deep he could pull a center out of sin maybe you're just displaying how his ability to save is stronger than anybody can imagine that god is a deliverer of every circumstance why did he let me go this way why did i have to go that far why did why didn't he stop me when this happened why did he stop me when that happened amen maybe god amen is just showing how mighty he is and how able he is to deliver and how able he is to save he so he says he let there be sin that he might be a savior he let there be sickness that he might be a healer he let there be hate that he might be love sure he did he's god and that's his attributes and he has to have something to display his attributes how would you ever know there was a night how would you ever know there was any if it was all daylight how would you ever know there was a night there's a night so it could prove daylight sure there is and christ is the mystery of god revealed he goes on and he says now he could do that in adam and eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh my this is rich to me just even think of it see god had see what god's purpose was now why didn't he just keep adam and eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there that is true but also he's a savior how do you know he is he is because i've had the experience see he is a savior and he had to express that my question is is he still a healer does he still need to express it it's still a testimony to the devil that amended there's got to be sickness to prove that he's a healer is he still a deliverer amen is there still many are there still many afflictions for the righteous but there's still a god to deliver them out of them all that there must still be many afflictions so that he can prove he can deliver from them all not just some but all amen and how is god going to prove that who's he going to use if god still wants to prove his world to this word his word to this unbelieving world and he still wants to defeat dev the devil in every one of his uh every one of his lies he's going to have to lift his word up and prove his word where is he going to do that through what kind of flesh through which individuals will god prove that he's a deliverer that he's a healer amen that he's a savior where will god prove that amen he'll prove it and you and i so let's not allow the devil to bring confusion when troubles happen amen but let's allow amen the eagle anointing in this day to lift us above the carnal to get where the prophet of god has explained these things to us so that we can have proper understanding and say god has not forgotten me amen god has not forsaken me but god is perfecting me he's showing himself he is defeating the devil right now that's why when sickness comes if we could just have the right approach this is why i'm saying i'm not preaching to you listen i'm sitting in the seat next to you this is the spirit of god preaching the man chad is saying oh i need that so bad god help me help me to every sickness comes or or you get a letter in the mail you know you owe a hundred thousand dollars in back taxes you didn't know anything about to where we could look at that and say oh devil you just created another testimony i'm not exactly there yet but i'm working on it friends god is taking us from one trial to the next and he's proving himself then something else that means he's proving himself and something else that means he's proving himself god has proven and proven and proven and proven until we can get to the point where we can say he has so proven himself to me that it doesn't matter what the circumstances look like all is well that's why when the shunammite woman runs up to elijah amen and she's got a dead child laying back in elijah's bed chamber and he says it's all well he says she says all is well why because god's in control this is going to work to the glory of god god will have his way well the doctors say xyz there's no chance for survival you say praise god when when i don't see how i could lose god takes me home i win god raises me up i win i can't lose see how when your head is lifted up above your enemies the perspective changes when the perspective changes then you can begin to give a sacrifice of joy and you can sing praises into the lord when your head is lifted up above your enemies brother bam says in the message redemption incompleteness and joy redemption and completeness and joy i love that title 1954 that's the way god does things let you come right down to the last minute and then shows you what he can do about it listen how many can say that is the truth it comes right down to the last minute and and then when god moves on the scene the next thing that happens is you you go when god after you're rejoicing in your deliverance and your healing and whatever god did then you go back and say god i'm sorry for all those things i said all those doubts and questions and god i'm sorry for all the because then you look back and you see how silly you were to worry that god wasn't going to deliver you that his power was still not able to heal that his arm had gotten short somehow and then you look back and you say god i'm sorry for saying that i'm sorry for doubting this and i'm sorry for questioning that i'm sorry for going to so-and-so and so and so and so and so i'm trying to fix my i'm sorry god and and when god comes on the scene in the last minute and brings a supernatural deliverance you look back and see how childish and foolish you were amen that's right he loves to do that this is what a prophet of god who knows the nature of god who knows the author real well that's what he said he loves to do that now listen we on our end we don't so much enjoy it but god loves to do that he loves he loves to surprise his people [Laughter] i don't know that my ticker can take too many more surprises he loves to surprise his people you men like to do your wife like that wait till her birthday just keep her under suspense because you love her that's the reason god lets us come to the end of our road sometimes because he loves us and wants to prove his supernaturalness of his power sometimes god doesn't want to give a little deliverance to you because god wants to show you how much he loves you and how big his strength and how much power and supernatural he has so he lets it get impossible amen what's he doing he's showing you how much he loves you and how perfect he is able to take care of you and i he didn't stop it when it was five mile an hour he let it go to 50. he didn't stop it when it was a minor problem he let it go till it was major amen why because god brother said he loves to surprise his people he loves to surprise his pride he loves to show you how big he is how powerful he is and this is what brother brandon said to prove his supernaturalness of his power because he loves us that's the reason he does it he he just lets us get right down to the place where we're just about ready to make the last step then he steps on the scene he let the hebrew children walk right in the fiery furnace but there was a fourth man standing there with a fan keeping it off of them see he always there he never leaves he's always near the angel of the lord and campeth about those that fear him i was thinking of some stories in the bible and when i was reading this quote and reading these things we already talked about daniel daniel when when god never delivered daniel until daniel was in the lion's den he didn't stop i mean he didn't stop uh darius you know he could have given darius a dream like he gave abimelech a dream darius was being tricked you know by by certain officers of the corps and they were trying to lay a trap for daniel darius loved daniel he would have never done this if he would have known daniel would have wound up and the lion's den but god never exposed their plan to darius although he could have but if god had exposed their plan to darius we would never have the story of daniel in the lion's den and daniel was then taken and darius tried prayed sought all night to wait to get daniel out of this and he couldn't do it he was so bound by the law and god wanted him to be bound god did not want him to find a way to let daniel go because god wanted to be magnified in this trial and daniel trusted in the lord all the way amen and and and they threw him into the lions and when they threw him into the lions then he he he testified that the angel of the lord came and shut the mouths of the lions when did the angel lord shut up show up daniel didn't see the angel lord when he was praying that final prayer before they arrested him he he didn't see the end of the lord when they were walking him up to the entrance of the caves of the lions then he didn't see the angel lord till he was in the lion's den and in the lions then he saw the angel of the lord shut the mouth of the lions and so then we know how the story progresses but they they draw daniel out darius runs the next day and he says daniel has your god saved you and says don't fear my god has saved me and darius starts to proclaim that daniel's god is the only god amen that declaration may not have come out if god had you know just given darius a little uh a funny feeling that these uh court officials weren't up to something he checked into it and say ah they're just trying to do something that would have magnified and glorified gone but after it happened the way it happened amendarius says there's only one god and daniel's gone then they took all of those men that were daniel's problem causing problems and they threw them into the lion's den and it says the lions before they hit the bottom break all of their bones that's how hungry those lions were that's how supernatural this deliverance was and gone through this circumstance that was a horrible circumstance got a king to declare that daniel's god was the true god and got rid of all daniel's problems all at once and all along we would have said couldn't you have just told darius and just got me out of this trouble but it was the whole process that solved so many problems i tell you friends there's trouble and press upon the bride and i don't expect it to get any easier but there are certain troubles that come that are going to fix all the troubles and show how mighty god is and free us from our enemy and it may not be easy but it will certainly be worth it so one reason that god will allow trials to come is so that he can display his attributes that he can show himself another reason that i'd like to discuss for a little bit is to build our character so god in in our trials he is showing his might his power his glory he's showing his attributes but he's also building our character let's look at ecclesiastes chapter 7 together this is another verse that i just begin to look at and oddly enough to enjoy and you'll understand when i read why i say oddly enough ecclesiastes 7 and verse 3. sorrow is better than laughter for by the sound sadness of the countenance the heart is made better listen to that again sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better sometimes these circumstances that come is not god destroying us but god perfecting us sometimes these things that break us and calls us it it's doing our heart good it's making us better brother branham says in the laodicean church age he says there is the gold of first peter 1 7 the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of gold i want you to catch what he said christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction he goes on to say you and this is still in the laodicean church age you had better come before it's too late saith the lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are you getting it listen to me naked physically we came into this world but naked spiritually we will not leave oh no we are going to take something with us what what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we'd better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before god so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering and the fiery furnace of affliction or will be the softness of this characterless laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden so to have christ-like character he says is developed in the fiery furnace of affliction amen if we want to reign with him we must suffer with him also but what is suffering producing it's producing a christ-like character and brother branham was saying here in the laodicean church age that we will take something with us when we go and there's only one thing that we can take with us when we go and that's the character that we gained in this journey so god has us in this life for a purpose we're here to serve his purpose and to magnify his name we're here for many reasons but one of those many reasons is to gain character and how do we gain character we gain character by the things we suffer let's look at psalms 119. psalms 119 and verse 71 it says it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn my statutes it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn the statutes there's things about god's nature that we could only understand by coming through this life the whiteness and purity and righteousness of god can only be understood in the backdrop of this evil age and the evil that we were born into so god allowed certain things to come in certain conditions to come so that he could bring us through this life so that we could understand his character so that we could gain in his character so that we would know him and he uses the fiery uh fiery furnace of affliction to build in us christ-like character so in every trial everything that is going on and happening to us it is accomplishing something for the kingdom of god but it's also building in us a character to reign with christ amen a character that'll make us more like him if these these trials are not without benefit to us and not without displaying god's attribute you know we would be willing to go through them just so god could be magnified but god is so good to us that is not just so that he can be magnified but so also we can gain christ-like character and we're becoming more like him through the things we suffered hebrews 5 8 tells us that though he were a son speaking of jesus christ yet learned he obedience by the things which he's suffering if christ had to learn obedience by the things he suffered how do we have to learn my no suffering that applies to this scripture it was good for me that i've been afflicted that i might learn by statutes paul says i had not known sin without the law like i didn't there's things i couldn't realize without you know i couldn't realize how perfect the law was the law come to show how imperfect i was and how imperfect i was come to show how perfect the law was the contrast was displaying how holy god was and how impossible it was for men to be holy so the law accomplished its purpose the paul says the law was perfect it wasn't amen it wasn't done away with and that it wasn't perfect it was fulfilled that christ was able to fulfill all the law for us amen so that we can now receive grace but it wasn't that the law was bad the law was there to show how bad amen we were and what we were born into and what we were born into showed how perfect the law was so they needed one another the sin that was born inside of me needed a law to expose sin but the sin exposed the law so god has allowed these circumstances to do two things one to show himself and one to perfect us to show amen how helpless we are but how perfect he is how the nature we're born with is so wrong it's so selfish it's so self-centered amen it's so self-gratifying the nature we're born into i mean you you take a little baby and a little baby never has to be taught to lie comes by nature they never have to be taught to steal right it comes by nature they don't have to be taught to abuse you know i've said this before but mothers you know they have their little baby and so sweet and they smell so good with the baby lotion after a bath and their little heads are so soft and they're so perfect and that little baby will lie to you when it learns how to talk you say it's perfect it's not perfect it's fallen it's innocent yet because it hasn't made a choice yet but when that baby learns to talk that baby will lie to you when you take away that baby's toy because it snatched it from another toddler and you take that toy and you give it back that baby will smack you in the face and pull your hair and bite you that's the nature we were born with that has to get out of us that is not the nature of christ what is it selfishness self-centeredness that's how we were born into this world lovers of self more than lovers of god and god is breaking that out of us friends to where i don't want my will i don't want my way i don't want anything of myself i just want it to be him i'm so tired of my way i went his way and every child is bringing reinforcing that i don't want my way i went his way i want to surrender i want to yield i want to be humble amen i want to subject myself to the word of god i want the word of god to rule every part of my life i'm so tired of my nature i want the nature of christ and christ was the perfect son perfect on obedience selfless sacrificing he was all of those things to the father and what he was i want to be and god is allowing all of these trials to mold into us that character by breaking off the wrong and we see it for what it is and we don't want it and moving towards the right though i don't want to take care of myself i don't want to be proud and arrogant i don't want none of those things anymore what i want more than anything is i want god to have his way with me and i want to surrender to him i'm so tired of my way i hate my way i went his way these trials are producing character go into this quote i want to wrap up with this quote out of the message i know i've quoted a portion of this to many of you and i've quoted from the pulpit many times and i've i've referred to this as my favorite quote and i believe it still probably is one of my favorites is not my most favorite but it's out of the message i know from 1960 it says and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him who's in control of your trouble the devil or god listen to the next statement and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god how many of us want a closer fellowship with god be careful be careful how high you put your hand but god has a mechanism and that mechanism is this world our fallen nature in this sin cursed world and god is using both of those in contrast to the perfectness of his character and of his word to break us and to mold us and to bring us into a closer fellowship with him there are times in our lives and i know i'm not the only one i know i'm just one of many but the times that i felt closest to god and i felt the presence of god the nearest and i've seen god's hand the mightiest and were the most difficult times in my life the hardest trials the deepest trials the most confusing time the times that hurt my heart was crushed i was inside a mess the times that i was the lowest is when i felt him the nearest and these trials bring us into a closer fellowship there have been times where i've literally prayed all through the night with no sleep at all but i have never once done that when times were good i wish i had a different testimony i wish i could say i pray through the night once a week but it was the press of the trial that created a need in me that needed me only had one solution and that one solution was gone and i cried out and cried out and cried out until he come on the scene to deliver me and and there's times like that that i could feel his presence drawing so near and he moved in supernatural ways to deliver and the times i have felt the closest to god have been the worst times in my life and so we can testify that what the prophet of god says is true god harnesses trouble he puts bits in his mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god there had been no rainbow until the flood come but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in the storm the little ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the coat of hope the covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation when do you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i want to see the promise prepare to go through the tribulation he's not talking about the great tribulation talking about the tribulation of trials and tribulations after you've gone to the trial after you've gone through the tribulation that's when you see the promise i want to see the promise i want to see the mighty hand of god i want to have a testimony go through the trial and you'll see the promise you know there's i was thinking in matthew when jesus was he was led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and for 40 days he fasted and afterward we were hungry and we went through the temptation of christ a couple weeks ago and talked about all of that but but during all of that he is battling it out with the devil he's being tempted he's standing on the word he's fasted 40 days he's hungry he's weak he's all of these things but when it was over after the devil left him said angels came and ministered unto him you realize the angels could have come and ministered to him anytime but he had to go through the trial first because that was part of the plan of god and after the trial angels came and ministered unto him and we want angels to come and minister unto us but when you watch the pattern in the scripture the pattern in the scripture is clear that god there's many trials many troubles but he delivers from them all and he pours out blessing and he pours out comfort and peace and he comforts us and he sends angels to minister to us but many times it's like it was for jesus after the trial after the trial is over when we've overcome by the word then god pours in the spirit and begins the mend and begins to heal don't forget god loves to test his children to prove what's inside he said i i'll read that sentence again that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i've liked that poem or psalm must i be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas we asked for comfort and peace this is my favorite quote right here we ask for comfort and peace and god gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comforts is just beyond the river i think it's interesting how life is set up and there's a certain amount of the wisdom of god in it all because when you're at the maximum of your strength when you're at the peak of your life you have no life experience and you have no money when you are the strongest and the most capable when your mind is the sharpest and your body can go work 24 hours a day you have no life experience nobody trusts you with anything banks won't loan you money and you have no money and you can't do anything you just have to get down and work really hard and piece together what you can try to have a home and try to get a car and just make it make it make it and then because of those experiences you learn how to save a little money because you never had any money you save a little money you might invest a little bit of money you work so many years in some place and then you get up to the age of retirement and when you get up to the age of retirement now you got a little bit of money you gotta you got a home you got a little bit of wisdom people trust you banks will loan you money but you've learned i don't want their money because there's interest credit cards will send you all the credit cards you want but you learned something when you were young and now you don't want them but you retire and you've got a little bit of something and and you're a little bit uh able financially but your body's starting to deteriorate you can't do what you used to do you can't hear like you heard you can't see like you say you used to see and you don't enjoy the things that you thought you were going to enjoy he said when i retire i'm going to get a bass boat and then you retire and you're like man that's a lot of maintenance and you got to change the oil in them and buy insurance and when i retire i want to get a camper and tour of the world but oh man i'm so tired of driving i don't want to drive from place to place like that then you got to set the camper up and then you got to tear it down is that right god has a way of keeping things in equity in the end of your life when you have means your body's failing you can't even use those means like you thought you were when you started saving when you were 25 but god has a way of keeping us all in need keeping us all in need of him and he always has a way you know it's amazing somebody can be wealthy or financially independent but that never stops their troubles from coming it doesn't stop sickness from coming it doesn't stop hospital visits from coming or family dying or loved ones leaving the truth doesn't matter how secure homes paid off and have a nest egg it doesn't stop troubles there's always something that god is going to use to mold our character to prove that his word still works in our lives that we can trust in him and have confidence we're still going to be leaning on him we're never going to be leaning on ourselves so i want to learn to me i want to learn that now you know how many times in your life have you built a little bit of security a little bit of something you know you're starting to feel good about a little bit of savings a little bit of that and all of a sudden god allows a wind to come and blow it all away it's just the bible says riches have wings like an eagle and they fly away i can say they got big wings they can fly fast and they can fly far because he wants to be your security that doesn't mean we live foolishly we don't save and we don't put money aside for needs in the future that's wisdom that's right but god has a way if we're having some confidence in that god has a way of letting it just go like this and you go well i never had it to start with anyway so praise god praise god anyways god wants to be our security he wants to be our support he wants his word his character to be all that we're focused on that i have a heavenly father i've got a husband who takes care of me i don't have to take care of myself i'm not depending on myself i do what's right i do what's wise i do what the scripture says but i'm not depending on any of that my confidence is in him everything else will fade away but he will never fade away we ask for comfort and peace and god gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comforts is just beyond the river don't you say brother chad i've got nothing but trouble praise god that's better than comfort and peace if you sat down in my office and began to go through your troubles and i pulled that one out you would just but that's what the prophet of god said god knows what he's doing in our lives and he knows why he's doing it and i want to get to the place where i can start to embrace it i we pray for comfort and peace i'm always i tell you i'm always going to pray for comfort and peace i can't bring myself to pray for trials and tribulations i just can't honestly do it but i know that no matter what i pray he's going to give me what's best for me and what his purpose for my life is and that's good enough for me that's what i really want and god knows my heart anyways i'm not asking for an easy life so that i never display his word i just want to be what he wants me to be and i want to do what he wants me to do and i want to come through this life getting all the character that i can all the christ-like character that i can so that i can rule and reign with him and when god puts you or me or somebody to rule over a city or cities we rule it exactly the way christ would because we gained the character here he goes on in this quote he says it wasn't until the hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the son of god standing there their troubles produced oh this quote their troubles produced the son of god standing among them amen their troubles how many have you ever been in real trouble and you know god came on the scene you know he showed up what produced that your troubles produced god and brought him on the scene their troubles produced the son of god standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave but not until they went into the fire did that comforter appear it was daniel who had purposed in his heart that he not defiled himself with the things of the world and was forced through a trial whether he'd pray to god or go to a lion's den but it was after the heat was put on and he was thrown into a lion's den that after that he saw the angel of the lord standing in the midst of him keeping away the great pillar of fire standing between him and the lions and the lions could not get him because he went through the trials and temptations and troubles he knew that his god was able to deliver him from them it was abraham after he'd seen the ground get barred and the drought come and lot separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world it was after he had heard the wines and cries of his herdsmen with no grass for his cattle but he maintained in the land that god gave him and told him to sojourn in and as on that day after he had been tried till his patience was at the end it was on that day then when after the trial was over he spoke face to face with elohim under the oak that day that's a perspective that we didn't always get that was after abraham when went through the trials and he says when when his patience was at the end it was on that day so what day did elohim show up to speak to abraham when abraham was at the end of his patience he had stayed where god told him to stay he wasn't leaving the land this time but all the conditions were getting worse and and lot was down there living deliciously in the land that he chosen and abraham stayed up here and it was getting worse and worse and worse and when he was at the end of his patience but he was staying where god told him to stay it was then that he met elohim face to face under the oak that day it was after he'd suffered his trials after he went through the troubles that he'd been through that god appeared to him in the form of a man and sat there and told him he was married and his wife's name was sarah and said she laughed at him in the tent behind it was there that abraham called him elohim it was after the trial and tribulation brother goes on to say in the message desperations so now we're talking on desperation for a few minutes now usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation it's too bad it has to be that but human beings are so slothful in their mind that it takes an emergency maybe sometimes the emergency is god's grace because humans are too slothful in their mind we think it's punishment we think it's terrible it's a horrible thing maybe that emergency is god's grace and the best thing that's ever happened to us something arises and when they do it throws us into that desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out that real thing that you are it shows what you're made out of and the time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things that's in you we think that these fire trials are here to destroy us they're not here to destroy us they're here to make us they're here to perfect us these things that happen will continue to happen they're here to draw something out of us that's down inside something that we may not even realize i mean we may not realize we have the strength you know so many people say oh i don't know what i would ever do if a certain loved one passed away i don't know how i would deal with it you don't know that the strength to overcome that lays in you i don't know what i would do if this happened i don't know what i would do if that happened i don't know what i would do and you don't know that the strength already lays inside of you by the spirit of god dwelling in you that there's a seed of god there and the word of god to overcome every obstacle and sometimes god allows these things to come to draw all of those good things out of us and we find out that his word is enough amen his spirit can take me through and we wouldn't have known it if we hadn't had to face it but when we face it then we know it brother brahm says in the message jehovah jireh now god loves to test his people every child that comes to god must be tested child trained no exceptions everyone and maybe tonight that you're sick just to have a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged god is on the throne he knows all things if we're truly born of the spirit of god everything's working together for our good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep that word he's kept it now for thousands of years to every believer would you be an exception and the answer is no i'm not an exception has god forgot you no is your trial too hard no is it outside the word no is the word quit working no god is still showing himself mighty on our behalf he's still a healer he's still a deliverer he's still a savior he's still all of those things and you and i are going to be a witness and we are going to have something to testify about and you think about uh we talked about daniel and the lion's den and the three hebrew men when they went into the fiery furnace brother bam said it was there that the comforter showed up in the fiery furnace not along the way when they got in but their troubles produced the son of god i mean you think about when when paul was on that ship for 14 days they never saw nor moon or star they all was lost i thrown out the tackle the ship was the rigging was thrown out everything was broke down there was certain death coming it was then that he met an angel that told him all would be well it was when peter was in prison chained between two guards then an angel showed up to him and let him out of prison when when he was in prison chained between two guards talking about impossible circumstances if you ever find yourself in prison chained between two guards amen you have an example to look to it was peter it was when when it was when the disciples had gone into the boat and pushed off into the sea of galilee and the storm came and the devil was trying to swamp the ship and kill them all and they all given up on life it was then jesus came walking on the water it was in that trial that peter found out he could walk on water by faith too amen do you realize that the situation that produced that a man a sin born man walking on water was one of the most horrible situations that those fishermen had ever faced they were going to die they knew they were going to die they had given up all hope they would no way they could direct the ship they had been on sea all of their life and they had given up all hope it was the worst storm of their lives the worst condition the closest they were to death and in that trial peter figured out that a human being by faith can walk on water amen what have we figured out in trials you know we figured out that blind eyes could open be open is that what we saw in the ministry in the last day that means somebody had to be blind so that blind eyes could be open you know we learned that god can raise the dead can god raise the dead somebody's got to die so god can raise the dead mary and martha suffered so god could raise lazarus you see god is always doing something we have to just trust him and let him do what he's doing and stop letting the devil say you're this and you're that and you're not this and say devil you don't know nothing really you don't know what's going to happen you don't know what god's plan is but one thing i know is god has me in the palm of his hand and i am one that the father has given them and he will not lose me he cannot lose me he's already given me a promise i have a witness in my heart he cannot lose me i don't know what will happen i don't know what god's plan is i'm not going to pretend to know what's planned but i know his word works and he's working in me something for his glory and for my good i say trials and tribulations are here to stay the opening of the seals didn't take him away the revelation of the word didn't take away our troubles but let the revelation the word lift your head above those of your enemies so that you can offer in the midst of trouble a sacrifice of joy that we can sing praises to the lord let the revelation give us a better understanding not a false belief that because of i'm the bride and because i've been lifted up out of laodicea now all the troubles have vanished they haven't vanished friends but our head has been lifted up above our enemies we've been taken up on eagle's wings and flown over the situation and now the earthly is becoming more understandable by the heavenly perspective now all of this is in the hand of god and i'm in the hand of god and these trials were never sent to harm us they were sent to perfect us and to glorify god amen god bless you let's all stand musicians if you come the apostle paul has a testimony and that testimony was god could preserve him through shipwreck through beatings through persecutions stonings and all of the above his testimony was god could keep him but look at what he had to go through to get that testimony peter had a great testimony john has a great testimony the three hebrew boys they have a great testimony daniel has a great testimony moses had a great testimony amen they all have a great testimony but what made their testimony was their test and i say god thank you for your great love and for teaching us through this ministry through the prophet of god to teach us to give us understanding that we don't have foolish ideas and foolish notions but that our head can be lifted above our enemies and we can understand what's going on all around us so the next time all the forces of hell gather against us and all the trouble on this earth starts to come our way we can say though he try me yet i shall come forth as golem this won't harm me man let's bow our heads let's pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord that you have given us in this day by sending a prophet and sharing your mind with us lord as you show us through the scriptures lord the pattern that you've said lord we can say thank you thank you lord you've been faithful to your word you have never forsaken us you have never failed to show yourself mighty on our behalf when we were sick you healed us lord when we had a financial need you provided lord when there was no way you've made a way lord and we have great testimonies we could go around the room lord and testify for hours of what you've done god we thank you for that god i just pray lord that you would take away all fear that we wouldn't fear that we wouldn't that we wouldn't have anxiety lord but we would learn to rest knowing that all is well may you plant that revelation deep in our hearts and take all the poison of the devil of those lies away from us so that we would know no matter what the circumstances you're still the captain of the ship no matter what's happening and what it looks like you had a plan before the foundation of the world and you're only working your plan to magnify yourself and to build us up god we love you for your goodness and your faithfulness for what you've done and what you're doing i pray to take us all lord and mold that beautiful character in each one of us and help us lord to have a testimony that will defeat the devil we love you we ask your blessing for us as we go in fellowship if we come again for the communion and feet washing pray to bless us lord and let us come with the right spirit the right attitude lord with the right approach in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you we'll be back at four o'clock for communion and feet washing listen man there is a source in times of need gives me hope that brings me
