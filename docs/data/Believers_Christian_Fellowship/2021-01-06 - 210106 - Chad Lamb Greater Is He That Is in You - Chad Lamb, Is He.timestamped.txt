[4:50] to the book of psalms psalm
[4:53] chapter 82 this is the scripture we open
[4:56] with on sunday
[4:59] so we're going to continue on with that
[5:02] thought
[5:04] the book of psalm chapter 82. in
[5:10] verse 6 i have said
[5:14] ye are gods and all of you are children
[5:17] of the most high
[5:19] and i like that scripture let's turn
[5:22] over to first john
[5:23] 4 all the way over
[5:26] close to revelation 1 john
[5:31] chapter 4. we'll read one
[5:34] scripture first john chapter 4 and verse
[5:38] 4
[5:39] ear of god little children and have
[5:41] overcome them
[5:42] because greater is he that is in you
[5:45] than he that is in the world
[5:47] i mean let's bow our heads and pray dear
[5:50] lord jesus we thank you father
[5:52] for the goodness that you've given to us
[5:54] we appreciate your word lord it's so
[5:56] rich to us
[5:57] lord as you open it to us it's so
[5:59] meaningful lord it
[6:01] means so much to us we find our
[6:02] identification in your word
[6:05] and god as we come tonight we've set
[6:06] aside this time we've gathered according
[6:08] to your word
[6:10] nor we ask now that you would feed us
[6:11] lord your lambs we've come lord
[6:14] and you're our great shepherd and we're
[6:15] asking that you would break the bread of
[6:16] life for us
[6:17] and feed us from your own hand use this
[6:20] vessel lord for your glory
[6:22] and give us ears to hear in our heart to
[6:24] perceive all that you're speaking to us
[6:25] in this day
[6:26] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[6:30] you can have your seeds when you seed i
[6:33] just want to announce that uh
[6:34] i've asked brother ben to preach on
[6:36] sunday brother ben siebold so he'll be
[6:38] preaching for us on sunday
[6:39] and it was obvious last time that he had
[6:41] a lot more material than he covered
[6:43] and i didn't want it to go a big long
[6:45] gap before he ministered so i wanted to
[6:46] get him in quickly
[6:48] so be praying for him he'll be taking
[6:49] the sunday service
[6:51] and i also wanted to share a little
[6:52] testimony with you
[6:54] on this past monday just two days ago
[6:57] we baptized a man here in the baptistry
[7:00] a man by the name of dean
[7:02] and he was a man that's been coming into
[7:05] the barbershop for years and brother
[7:06] jeremy sanders has been cutting his hair
[7:08] and they've talked about the bible and
[7:10] talked about different things for many
[7:11] many years
[7:12] and brother jeremy even shared that many
[7:14] years ago he even took
[7:16] this man this gentleman dean to speak
[7:18] with brother lonnie
[7:19] and brother lonnie was sharing some of
[7:21] the message with him and brother lonnie
[7:23] kept taking him to water baptism
[7:25] and every question and every every time
[7:27] they went off in a new direction they
[7:28] came back to water baptism
[7:30] but it seemed at that time that it just
[7:32] didn't click it didn't register
[7:34] and brother jeremy said just a little
[7:35] bit ago a week or two ago he was talking
[7:37] to the man again in the barbershop
[7:39] and he wanted to know more about
[7:41] revelation the book of revelation he had
[7:43] a desire
[7:45] and when he made a mention of something
[7:47] jeremy was brother jeremy's getting
[7:49] ready to tell him something
[7:50] and he felt a strong urge to talk to him
[7:53] about water baptism
[7:54] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[7:57] he did in that time it clicked
[7:59] and the man wanted to be baptized so we
[8:01] brought him he came here monday monday
[8:03] was the day he could come
[8:04] he came here monday and we baptized him
[8:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[8:08] and this baptistery here and he wants to
[8:11] come to services when he can he
[8:12] mentioned that he might come wednesday i
[8:13] don't see him tonight but
[8:15] he may come his name's dean so if you
[8:16] see a visitor named dean just greet him
[8:19] in the name of the lord
[8:20] he's hungry for revelation he's hungry
[8:23] to know the word of god
[8:24] he's been raised as a catholic man all
[8:26] of his life and so
[8:27] just be praying for him and be prayed
[8:29] that god fills that hunger he's got
[8:32] for the word and the god will open his
[8:34] eyes to truth
[8:36] amen that i took from a text out of this
[8:39] uh
[8:40] chapter 4 verse 4 first john and i want
[8:43] to talk about greater is he that is in
[8:44] you
[8:45] and this is a good time to talk about
[8:47] this this was the subject god
[8:49] actually he had laid this on my heart
[8:51] before sunday's message
[8:52] but laid it on my heart to preach after
[8:54] sunday's message so
[8:55] i i was thankful for that that i knew
[8:57] what to cover this time
[8:59] as some of you may have seen that there
[9:01] was riots that broke out in washington
[9:02] dc today
[9:04] and i didn't know it i i was studying
[9:06] not watching the news but somebody sent
[9:07] me a text
[9:08] and i looked it up and and i can say the
[9:10] world is falling apart
[9:12] this nation is falling apart it's coming
[9:15] unglued at the seams
[9:17] as the prophet told us it had to
[9:20] none of these things are outside of what
[9:22] the prophet told us said america will
[9:23] never rise again shall fall
[9:25] she's rejected the gospel she is
[9:27] finished he goes i don't even pray for
[9:29] her anymore
[9:30] you know and that was a prophet who
[9:32] could see that thing afar off
[9:35] but this is the fulfillment of
[9:37] everything that he talked about
[9:39] and so there were riots you know
[9:41] pro-trump rioters and
[9:42] they had you know breached the security
[9:44] barricades at the capitol
[9:46] and uh got into the the building and
[9:49] breaking out windows and climbing in and
[9:51] and they're protesting the certification
[9:54] of the election
[9:55] because they they know the country's
[9:57] corrupt but that wasn't new brother ram
[9:59] told us that back in the 60s amen
[10:02] and so the world's in chaos
[10:05] and uh i just thank god he's put us in a
[10:07] different position
[10:09] when there's riots breaking out and
[10:11] there's there's pro this riot and anti
[10:13] this riot
[10:14] and now anybody who gets upset needs to
[10:16] go out into the street and break
[10:18] something and destroy something but when
[10:20] the world's falling apart
[10:21] god is bringing himself back together
[10:24] the body is being knit back together
[10:26] to display christ in all of his
[10:28] attributes in the form of his bride
[10:31] and i thank god that those things are
[10:33] troubling
[10:34] those things are terrible that i'm not
[10:36] even putting my eyes on those things
[10:38] because there's something so much
[10:39] glorious we're looking at
[10:41] there's something so much wonderful that
[10:43] the world is going the way the world has
[10:45] to go brother brenham said the world is
[10:47] falling apart
[10:48] let it fall apart it has to fall apart
[10:51] to bring about the millennium
[10:53] unless there's a destruction of all the
[10:54] world orders there'll be no millennium
[10:56] friends so
[10:57] it's got to fall apart it's got to fall
[11:00] apart for the kingdom that's coming
[11:02] so man is destroying himself he's in the
[11:04] process of destroying himself
[11:06] and he's in the process of creating his
[11:08] own hell
[11:09] because that's what man does best man as
[11:11] he rejects god
[11:13] when he tries to save himself he loses
[11:15] himself as he tries to create
[11:17] a better a better standard of living in
[11:20] a better society
[11:21] than what god had in mind he destroys
[11:24] himself
[11:24] and that's what's happening but greater
[11:27] is he that is in you
[11:29] than he that is in the world amen god is
[11:32] giving us an identification so we don't
[11:34] be we don't have to be identified as
[11:37] americans
[11:38] we can be identified as christians who
[11:42] live in america this is where god
[11:43] planted us this is where he wants us to
[11:45] be
[11:45] and i thank god whether it rises or
[11:47] whether it falls
[11:48] i want to be where he wants me to be and
[11:51] i want to serve him where he has me
[11:53] at but i do not want
[11:56] i can say this way i do not want to act
[11:58] like an american
[12:01] americans are selfish and childish and
[12:03] rebellious
[12:07] they are the epitome of laodicean
[12:11] people's rights my rights i want
[12:14] i want a stimulus check to buy enough
[12:16] gas money to go back and
[12:18] break out the windows of the very
[12:19] building that passed the law to give me
[12:21] the check
[12:24] how that went full circle
[12:28] but praise god we've got another kingdom
[12:32] we've got something else that means so
[12:34] much more to us
[12:35] these things will go the way they'll go
[12:37] i'm not going to protest i'm not going
[12:39] to get upset
[12:40] i'm not going to complain because my god
[12:43] is good
[12:44] and his word is true and the clock is
[12:46] ticking
[12:47] right on time
[12:50] i want to read out of the message as the
[12:52] eagle stirs her nest
[12:53] from 1961 brother bram says no sir
[12:57] papa eagle they look just like him they
[12:59] believe the same thing he does they look
[13:01] like him yes sir
[13:02] they're made like him they're built like
[13:04] him
[13:05] and he knows they're genuine eagles oh
[13:07] my that's what god wants a genuine
[13:10] messiah yes he is messiah messiah is the
[13:14] anointed one and we are his children
[13:17] which have a lesser anointing so we're
[13:19] as jehovah eagles great eagle and we're
[13:21] eaglets
[13:22] he's messiah and we with the same
[13:24] anointing are messiahs amen anointed
[13:27] messiah means the anointed one
[13:29] are you anointed amen what with the same
[13:32] spirit that he was anointed with
[13:34] we have it in measure he has it without
[13:36] measure
[13:37] he was god manifest in the flesh and
[13:39] we're sons of god
[13:41] parts of him come on yes sir the very
[13:44] works that i do shall you do also
[13:46] i might take a spoonful of water out of
[13:48] this ocean out here and you'd never miss
[13:50] it in the ocean
[13:51] that's the way we'd be that's the way
[13:54] we'd be missed if
[13:54] we would happen to to drop out but
[13:57] remember the same chemicals that's in
[13:59] the entire ocean
[14:00] is in that spoon some spoon some of
[14:02] water
[14:03] that's just more of it out there so
[14:05] that's what it is
[14:06] you say what is it out there ocean water
[14:09] what is it out there
[14:10] ocean water what is it in here in the
[14:12] spoonful
[14:13] ocean water what is it out there ocean
[14:16] water what is it in here
[14:17] ocean water it's exactly the same thing
[14:20] just a portion of what that is he said
[14:24] that's the way
[14:24] papa eagle thinks about his little ones
[14:28] think about that that's the way papa
[14:29] eagle thinks about his little ones
[14:31] that's not how the little ones think
[14:32] about themselves that's how papa eagle
[14:34] thinks about his little little ones
[14:36] it's the same thing only in a portion
[14:38] the spoonful is in you amen
[14:40] what is it out there it's god what is it
[14:42] in here it's god
[14:45] it's the life of god there it's the life
[14:47] of god in here
[14:49] brother brahma says in the message
[14:50] messiah from 61 he says
[14:53] man was made to be a god
[14:56] god was made to be man
[14:59] striking o messiah the great jehovah
[15:03] dwelt in a human body
[15:04] made that body like his so he could be a
[15:07] human body a messiah to govern this
[15:09] earth and control it
[15:10] amen the works that i do shall they do
[15:12] also oh i like that
[15:15] we come down here to questions and
[15:17] answers from 1964 he says now brother
[15:19] branham
[15:19] could jesus look like you or you be
[15:22] jesus
[15:23] or something like that this is a great
[15:26] question amen
[15:27] and we know back in the day there was a
[15:29] deity spirit that was moving in and
[15:30] brother branham was battling that at
[15:32] this time
[15:33] and they were saying that that he was
[15:35] jesus christ and so somebody asked the
[15:37] questions and questions and answers
[15:39] and look at how brother branham
[15:40] addresses this question
[15:42] he said could you could jesus look like
[15:44] you or you be jesus or something like
[15:46] that
[15:48] and this says one sense of the word
[15:50] that's exactly the truth
[15:54] another sense of the word is an
[15:56] antichrist
[15:58] that's the difference between right and
[15:59] wrong to make me the person of the lord
[16:01] jesus christ would be an antichrist
[16:03] for that person of the lord jesus is
[16:05] sitting at the right hand of majesty on
[16:07] high
[16:07] and will come again in great power and
[16:09] glory but for his life that was in him
[16:12] being upon me
[16:13] and upon you who have him it's exactly
[16:15] the truth and you become
[16:17] christ you remember my message on
[16:21] messiahs
[16:22] you you are the word messiah means the
[16:25] anointed one now you
[16:26] are if you have the holy spirit you
[16:28] become the anointed one
[16:30] then there's all kinds of anointed ones
[16:33] as paragraph 88 we jump down to the
[16:35] bottom of this where he's answering this
[16:36] question in paragraph 111
[16:38] he said now you understand we are not we
[16:41] are messiahs but not that jesus
[16:43] he's our father we're just anointed with
[16:46] his spirit
[16:47] and that's the reason his life and
[16:48] that's and that gets people see
[16:51] if you don't set and think it through it
[16:53] gets people to believe
[16:54] well this guy would be the messiah sure
[16:56] he
[16:57] is sure he is
[17:02] this one over here could be they both
[17:04] are
[17:06] so which one's the messiah both
[17:10] amen well how can there be two of them
[17:13] there's thousands of them see but you
[17:16] see his life is
[17:17] it separated on the day of pentecost
[17:20] when that pillar of fire come down it
[17:21] separated
[17:22] separated like tongues and set upon each
[17:24] of them god dividing himself among his
[17:26] people
[17:27] because the church and christ is one
[17:29] just as the husband and wife
[17:31] is one so we find out when we say
[17:34] greater is he that
[17:35] that is in you amen it's it's him it's
[17:38] his life
[17:39] amen that makes you a messiah that makes
[17:41] you an anointed one
[17:43] that makes you part of christ amen and
[17:46] he said this one could be messiah of
[17:48] course he can and this one too
[17:49] yeah there's no conflict there's no
[17:52] argument
[17:53] amen how could both of them be how could
[17:55] there be two of them he said there's
[17:56] thousands of them why
[17:58] it's the bride expressed on earth amen
[18:00] is the messiah is the anointed one
[18:02] is god anointed in flesh again
[18:07] and the message is your life worthy of
[18:08] the gospel he says and did you know
[18:11] that you're a little creator yourself
[18:14] you know that certainly you've seen
[18:17] people that you just love to be around
[18:20] you don't know why you just love that
[18:22] type of person have you seen that
[18:24] just as kind there you like to be around
[18:27] them they
[18:28] create that atmosphere by the life they
[18:30] live the way they talk their
[18:31] conversation
[18:33] then you've seen those that every time
[18:34] you shun them all the time
[18:36] they want to talk about something evil
[18:38] and talk about somebody say
[18:40] oh my there they come they're going to
[18:42] criticize somebody there
[18:43] here's in here now he's going to talk me
[18:45] about this man
[18:46] all they're going to do is tell dirty
[18:48] jokes or something about women or
[18:50] something like that
[18:50] you just hate to get around them see
[18:53] they create
[18:54] seemingly pretty nice people but they
[18:56] create that atmosphere
[18:58] and the things that you think on and the
[19:00] things that you do the
[19:01] actions that you think you talk about
[19:04] creates an atmosphere
[19:06] this is what i want to talk about for a
[19:07] little while greater is he that's in you
[19:09] than he that's in the world and what's
[19:11] in there
[19:11] it's the life of god it's zoe life it's
[19:14] a it's the anointed it's the messiah
[19:16] a messiah amen but there's a power of
[19:19] creation within us
[19:22] that's right brother branham said if you
[19:24] have a a fraction i think he said
[19:26] of the life of god there's enough power
[19:28] in you to speak a world into existence
[19:30] and go and live a private life on there
[19:31] he said but that power is controlled by
[19:33] a law and it's the law of faith amen
[19:35] it's got to operate by the word of god
[19:38] amen according to the will of god and be
[19:39] led by the spirit of god
[19:41] so we know that there's a power of
[19:43] creation within
[19:45] amen the children of god and we
[19:48] we saw that expressed in brother branham
[19:50] we saw it when
[19:51] the lord spoke to him and he spoke
[19:53] squirrels into existence
[19:54] and it wasn't like in in the days of
[19:57] jesus christ when jesus took something
[19:59] and broke it and multiplied it
[20:01] now we're moving into a realm where
[20:03] there is a man that was born in sin not
[20:05] virgin born but sin born
[20:07] he's come to a place in the cycle of
[20:09] redemption where god can tell him
[20:11] amen to speak a spoken word creation
[20:14] amen and not take elements and change
[20:16] them not take elements and alter them
[20:19] but speak and absolutely create
[20:22] but it means where there was nothing
[20:24] create squirrels amen so we've seen that
[20:27] dynamic power
[20:28] and remember what i want to when i want
[20:30] to labor on what i want to talk about
[20:32] is the ability to create atmosphere
[20:36] because those things are those things
[20:38] are wonderful when we see that we see
[20:40] amen that god's power of redemption is a
[20:43] complete power when he can bring man to
[20:45] that place
[20:46] but i want to look at the god's power of
[20:47] redemption in us and
[20:49] in the zoe life on the inside and the
[20:51] ability to create
[20:52] around us to be creators and create
[20:54] atmosphere it
[20:56] talks about there's even an ability to
[20:58] create with those who have no zoe life
[21:00] because they create a bad atmosphere and
[21:03] if they have power to create atmosphere
[21:05] who don't have the life of god what can
[21:07] we do with the life of god
[21:10] so then that the things that you think
[21:12] on the things that you do the
[21:13] actions the things you talk about create
[21:16] an atmosphere
[21:20] i'm going to read a couple more quotes
[21:21] here as we move on
[21:23] in 1957 the message life he said then if
[21:26] we have
[21:27] zoe god's life in us we become sons of
[21:30] god
[21:30] and amateur creators
[21:34] in the message love from 1956 he says
[21:36] now do you realize
[21:37] being a son or daughter of god that you
[21:39] are a minor creator
[21:41] do you know you create the atmosphere
[21:43] that you live in
[21:45] did you hear that you create the
[21:48] atmosphere if you live in
[21:49] if you don't like the atmosphere you're
[21:51] living in
[21:53] who are you going to blame amen you're
[21:55] going to blame the government or cnn or
[21:57] you're going to blame democrats or the
[21:59] management at work
[22:03] amen greater is he that's in you than he
[22:05] that's in the world
[22:06] amen there's a power a creative power
[22:08] within the believers
[22:10] and and brother branham says you create
[22:12] the atmosphere that you live in
[22:14] amen and if we can be conscious of this
[22:16] and aware of what's going on and what's
[22:17] working in us and through us
[22:19] amen we can create an atmosphere that we
[22:21] can live in that will
[22:22] affect others and create an effect all
[22:24] around us
[22:25] and then we don't have to live in
[22:27] everybody else's atmosphere or the
[22:29] atmosphere of the world we can live in a
[22:31] different atmosphere
[22:34] brother brahman says i'm going to read
[22:36] two quotes from 1955 where brother brown
[22:38] just gives
[22:38] absolute practical advice on how to do
[22:41] this
[22:42] he says now it's strange
[22:45] that this is so much thought of people
[22:48] they say well
[22:48] i'm weak my faith is not very much
[22:51] i'm not a very good christian
[22:55] he said that's just what the devil wants
[22:57] you to say
[22:59] you're just talking his language right
[23:01] then
[23:02] see and sometimes there's a there's a
[23:05] false humility
[23:06] uh within us that wants to just almost
[23:09] like if we can abase ourselves and say
[23:11] well i'm no good and i'm really nothing
[23:12] and i
[23:13] and i'm this this and this that somehow
[23:15] that's more christian or more of a
[23:16] christian attitude
[23:18] but i i want to get to the place where
[23:19] there's no more pride because
[23:21] that that whole thing is based on pride
[23:23] actually
[23:25] because you know when we think too much
[23:28] about ourselves like whether somebody
[23:29] thinks about me or doesn't think about
[23:31] me or they like me or don't like me
[23:32] then you're just thinking about yourself
[23:35] you're consumed with your thinking about
[23:37] what people think of me whether they
[23:39] think well of me or what they think bad
[23:40] of me and
[23:41] and you know and i don't want them to
[23:42] think wrong of me so i'll just tell
[23:44] i'm no good and i'm nothing that that's
[23:46] just a self-absorption amen
[23:48] we got to get away from that until we
[23:50] can get to the true reality of who we
[23:52] are
[23:53] amen where i am a child of god by the
[23:56] grace of god
[23:57] his word has called me out and he's
[23:58] placed me in this age and i'm
[24:00] comfortable with what he's done in me
[24:02] amen and it has nothing
[24:04] to do with the human side of me i know
[24:06] that in me is no good thing
[24:08] amen but there's a life that he's placed
[24:09] down in the soul that he came and he
[24:11] quickened himself to life
[24:13] and that is nothing less than god
[24:16] so i stand here as a paradox yes there's
[24:19] nothing good in me of course
[24:20] that we're all in the same boat there
[24:22] there's nothing good in any of us
[24:24] amen but if you're a child of god
[24:26] there's a portion of god down there
[24:28] there's a spoonful out of the ocean amen
[24:30] and we've got to recognize that in the
[24:32] reality amen
[24:33] and the reality of what it is because if
[24:35] we keep speaking that
[24:37] down amen we're pushing down the very
[24:40] thing that's going to give us overcoming
[24:42] power
[24:43] until we can get to the reality that
[24:45] says by the grace of god
[24:46] i am who i am
[24:50] paul the apostle he struggled he was
[24:52] struggling with this in the uh the book
[24:55] of corinthians he's
[24:56] he's saying i'm an apostle and lisa the
[24:58] apostles and not
[24:59] worthy to be called an apostle because i
[25:02] persecuted the church
[25:04] paul brother talks about that paul
[25:06] always he
[25:07] always was reflecting back on on the
[25:10] persecution and
[25:11] the death of stephen and he said it
[25:12] troubled him
[25:14] and he looked back and he says i i'm
[25:16] lisa the apostles
[25:18] not even worthy to be called an apostle
[25:20] amen because i persecuted the church
[25:23] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[25:28] oh if we could all get to that place and
[25:30] create that atmosphere around us
[25:32] amen i'm not the worst and i'm not the
[25:34] best i'm just what he made me
[25:39] and i want to be all that he made me and
[25:41] i don't want to hold back his expression
[25:43] anymore
[25:44] and i don't want to downplay what god
[25:46] has done amen because to be a son of god
[25:48] to be a child of god
[25:49] is no trivial thing it's no light thing
[25:52] it's not something to be trampled on and
[25:53] put down
[25:54] and put in the back pocket and hid from
[25:56] people
[25:58] it's the greatest privilege in the world
[26:01] it's a wonderful thing amen
[26:03] so we want to be careful how we talk
[26:06] brother says well i'm weak my faith is
[26:09] not very much
[26:10] i'm not a very good christian that's
[26:12] just what the devil wants you to say
[26:14] you're just talking his language right
[26:16] then you mustn't never
[26:18] say that amen
[26:24] you mustn't never say that don't never
[26:26] let your testimony be negative
[26:28] let it be positive all the time see
[26:30] listen we're talking about creating an
[26:32] atmosphere that we're amateur creators
[26:34] who create an atmosphere amen brother
[26:36] brother branham is giving us
[26:37] practical advice and he's telling us
[26:39] what to say and what not to say
[26:42] to create this atmosphere don't never
[26:44] let your testimony be negative
[26:46] let it be positive all the time i'm
[26:48] saved i have god in my heart
[26:50] i believe him with all my heart do you
[26:52] believe in divine healing with all my
[26:53] heart
[26:54] he's he's showing you what to say i'm
[26:58] saved i have god in my heart i believe
[27:00] him with all my heart
[27:03] amen he says now your testimony always
[27:06] in your thoughts everything
[27:08] never permit a negative thought to come
[27:10] in your mind if you can help it
[27:13] when it starts that don't entertain it
[27:16] well you say i can't help the thoughts
[27:18] from coming
[27:18] well that'll be like the farmer that
[27:20] said he couldn't stop he couldn't stop
[27:22] the birds from flying over his place
[27:23] but he could sure stop them from
[27:25] roosting so that's the good thing you
[27:28] see
[27:28] you can't help the thoughts when they
[27:29] come but don't entertain them
[27:33] just pass it on no sir jesus christ is
[27:35] my savior
[27:36] all things are mine by god i'm going to
[27:38] keep them i'm going to testify of them
[27:41] and god can only bless you as you
[27:43] confess
[27:44] what he has done for you see his th he's
[27:47] the high priest of our confession is
[27:49] that right
[27:49] hebrews 3 he said that he's the high
[27:51] priest of our confession
[27:53] he can only do it for us as we accept it
[27:55] and believe it
[27:56] and confess it so
[28:00] part of what creates our atmosphere that
[28:02] we live in are the words that come out
[28:03] of our mouth
[28:04] because the power of life and death lay
[28:06] in the tongue and happy is the man that
[28:08] eateth the fruit thereof
[28:10] and you find sometimes we find believers
[28:12] they believe this message
[28:14] and remember they're always in a cycle
[28:16] of defeat and always in a cycle of
[28:18] destruction
[28:19] always in a cycle of negative and losing
[28:22] and not in a cycle of winning
[28:23] and my question is are we creating that
[28:26] atmosphere and living in the own
[28:27] creation that we've created with spoken
[28:29] word
[28:32] like it never works out for me
[28:36] well just keep saying that right because
[28:39] the power of life and death laying the
[28:40] tongue
[28:41] you keep saying what never works out for
[28:42] me i i just don't believe i'm ever going
[28:45] to get over this i just don't believe i
[28:46] can ever conquer this
[28:47] i just don't know how things are ever
[28:49] going to be right in our home i just
[28:51] don't know how
[28:51] our marriage is ever going to be right i
[28:53] just don't know how my children have
[28:54] ever come to the lord
[28:55] hey you keep confessing that amen and
[28:58] you're expressing
[28:59] amen creative power out of the lips of a
[29:02] son of
[29:02] daughter of god
[29:06] there's power in what we say there's
[29:09] power in what we confess
[29:10] amen and sometimes we i believe many
[29:13] times the
[29:14] cycle of defeat in the cycle of
[29:16] destruction and the cycle of negative in
[29:18] our life
[29:18] is our very own fault because we don't
[29:20] simply take the word of god
[29:22] and say what the word says we start
[29:26] speaking
[29:26] symptoms and feelings and reasonings and
[29:29] all the messages that the devil give us
[29:31] and we deny the very word that will help
[29:33] us overcome
[29:36] amen and saying well you know i hope i'm
[29:40] a son of god
[29:41] that kind of confession will get you
[29:43] nowhere but if you've got an
[29:45] inkling of a feeling in your heart
[29:46] towards god you say i
[29:48] am a son of god amen if there's
[29:50] something pricking you and pulling you
[29:52] you say god is calling me god is drawing
[29:54] me amen god is working in my heart
[29:56] i belong to him
[30:00] sometimes we we want to we want to be so
[30:02] honest we lie
[30:06] we're so worried about being honest with
[30:08] the thoughts on our mind and not honest
[30:09] with the still small voice in our heart
[30:12] amen and because we have a doubt comes
[30:14] through our mind
[30:15] we feel obligated to confess that doubt
[30:18] amen remember brother branham said
[30:20] satan can put thoughts in your mind
[30:25] he can't read your thoughts all he can
[30:28] hear is what you confess out of your
[30:29] mouth and see the way you act
[30:32] but he can put thoughts in your mind
[30:34] amen and then when he watches you
[30:35] confess
[30:36] those thoughts or act them out then he
[30:37] just smiles because it's exactly the
[30:39] goal
[30:41] because inside of you is a dynamo power
[30:43] of god that can create an atmosphere
[30:45] amen that can move circumstances that
[30:48] can bind enemy forces
[30:50] and loose things upon this earth there's
[30:52] power there if you'll take that power
[30:54] and express it by the word of god
[30:59] so we get in this nega i just don't know
[31:02] how i'm ever going to get better
[31:03] it's always been this way i i mean
[31:07] we are always struggling
[31:11] how about saying my father owns the
[31:13] cattle on a thousand hills
[31:14] amen and he has promised to pour
[31:16] blessings upon me i've paid my tithe
[31:18] i've given my offering and he'll pour
[31:20] out a blessing i cannot contain and i'm
[31:22] excited to see what god's going to do
[31:24] next
[31:25] instead of saying you know it seems like
[31:27] we're just one of those we never have
[31:28] enough
[31:29] it's always been rough for us i guess
[31:31] that's my lot in life amen
[31:32] where in the word did you read that what
[31:35] scripture are you quoting
[31:40] we're creating the atmosphere we live in
[31:44] we're creating you know sometimes you
[31:47] know we
[31:48] we we hold back on confession the word
[31:51] amen and and we don't either we we don't
[31:54] want to be fanatical we
[31:55] we don't want to just be self-deceived
[31:58] and so
[31:58] we have to reason things in our mind and
[32:02] speak things based off reasoning and
[32:04] feelings that are
[32:05] absolutely contrary to the word of god
[32:13] i mean like well
[32:16] you know if i'm not elect i'm just going
[32:19] to serve the elect
[32:23] where will that confession get you
[32:26] that confession will keep you always
[32:28] wondering whether or not
[32:30] you're chosen of god if you keep
[32:32] confessing that you'll never be able to
[32:34] get over that hump
[32:37] and what good does it do it doesn't
[32:40] accomplish anything
[32:43] but if god is dealing in your heart and
[32:45] you believe this word
[32:47] amen and god is drawing you by the word
[32:49] who does he draw
[32:50] he doesn't draw non-elect he draws his
[32:52] elect to the message of the
[32:54] hour he shines the light in their heart
[32:55] they receive it by faith
[32:57] they know it's the truth amen there's
[32:59] this word coming to word
[33:00] there's a natural attraction don't throw
[33:03] that away
[33:04] because of a thought that's in the mind
[33:05] a doubt or a mistake
[33:07] don't throw that away say i believe this
[33:11] word i believe it's true
[33:12] and i believe it's for me because i
[33:14] believe it
[33:16] why do you think it's for you because i
[33:18] believe it like i'm not pretending to
[33:19] believe it i believe it
[33:21] amen and i know in my heart that it's
[33:22] the truth i know that god sent a prophet
[33:24] in this day i know the word is true i
[33:26] know god is manifest in his bride
[33:28] amen who knows that who knows that in
[33:30] the bottom of their heart the elect know
[33:32] that friends
[33:34] not an intellectual understanding but a
[33:35] reality inside amen god has showed you
[33:38] his word of life he has revealed it to
[33:40] you
[33:40] and i would take that and say by the
[33:42] grace of god he has revealed himself to
[33:44] me and i'm his
[33:47] because he only reveals himself to his
[33:49] elect
[33:51] and so we create an atmosphere that we
[33:53] walk in and then brother branham said
[33:56] listen your mind in your mind
[34:00] you could be thinking you're the worst
[34:02] christian on the planet
[34:06] and you may have evidence to back up
[34:08] that statement
[34:12] but brother bam said don't say that say
[34:14] i'm a good christian
[34:15] i believe the word god is my father amen
[34:19] say i'm overcoming by his grace and say
[34:21] i will
[34:22] overcome this trial and i will overcome
[34:24] the next trial i will not always be in
[34:26] this cycle of defeat
[34:27] but i will come clear and the things i
[34:29] don't understand i will
[34:30] understand by revelation someday
[34:35] amen amen if we're living in a bad
[34:39] atmosphere
[34:40] we have nobody else to blame amen it's
[34:42] not the news it's not social media
[34:45] amen it's not anybody else if we or
[34:47] children of god are living in a bad
[34:49] atmosphere
[34:49] there's nobody to blame but us because
[34:52] there's creative power by the sea gene
[34:55] of god to create a new atmosphere and if
[34:57] we want a new atmosphere we've got to
[34:59] start speaking
[35:00] a new atmosphere we've got to change our
[35:02] language and make our language match the
[35:04] bible
[35:05] amen and say it and then i can say this
[35:07] because brother branham said it
[35:09] say it until you believe it
[35:14] is that honest is that honest say it
[35:16] till you believe it
[35:17] i mean i'm saying i believe it but i
[35:19] have doubts and i have questions
[35:21] brother branham said say it till you
[35:22] believe it how could he say such a thing
[35:25] because he's telling you to say what the
[35:27] bible says
[35:29] and if you say what the bible says you
[35:31] can say it till you believe it and if
[35:33] you disbelieve it there's another spirit
[35:35] and not the spirit of god
[35:37] because the spirit of god will not give
[35:38] you a contrary thought that's contrary
[35:40] to this word
[35:42] so say what the word says and if you're
[35:44] struggling with a doubt or a question in
[35:46] your heart
[35:46] say it until the question goes away say
[35:49] it till the doubt is quiet and say it
[35:51] till you believe it
[35:56] hallelujah
[35:58] in the next message in 1955 brother bam
[36:00] still talking about
[36:02] giving advice to just around the corner
[36:05] when you get to thinking about divine
[36:07] healing
[36:08] get to thinking about christ keep him on
[36:11] your mind
[36:13] if there be any praise if there be any
[36:15] virtue the bible says
[36:16] think on these things
[36:21] if any thought comes by well maybe it
[36:24] couldn't be so
[36:25] maybe get it off your mind right quick
[36:28] think on these things that's positive
[36:30] never let a negative thought pass
[36:31] through
[36:32] don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to
[36:34] keep your thoughts
[36:35] positive jesus don't think
[36:39] sitting there in a wheelchair you that
[36:40] are your hope don't think that you're
[36:42] hopeless
[36:43] helpless you're not
[36:47] did you catch that he said think i'm
[36:49] going to read that again
[36:50] don't think sitting there in a
[36:52] wheelchair you
[36:54] that you're hopeless helpless you're not
[36:59] you're not don't let that negative
[37:01] thought ever pass through
[37:03] don't let it anchor you can't help it
[37:05] from going through your mind that's
[37:06] right
[37:06] but don't let it stop like the old
[37:09] farmer said i can't keep the birds from
[37:11] flying over my place
[37:12] but he had a double-barreled shotgun
[37:14] said i can sure keep them from roosting
[37:16] so you do the same thing you too don't
[37:19] let them roost
[37:20] let them pass right on through now
[37:22] here's the shotgun to use
[37:25] both new and old testament a double
[37:27] barrel very good too
[37:29] i'll tell you it keeps them all away so
[37:32] what do we do to keep the negative
[37:34] thoughts away you take the double barrel
[37:36] shotgun of the word and blow them out of
[37:38] the sky amen
[37:39] keep shooting those birds away you can't
[37:41] stop them from coming but you do not
[37:43] have to identify with that thought
[37:46] you do not have to confess it if it
[37:48] doesn't match the word
[37:50] you do not have to speak it out of your
[37:52] lips
[37:54] and i would just take the scripture and
[37:56] blow it out of the water
[37:57] blow it out of the sky or wherever it's
[37:59] at
[38:01] but praise be to god brother branham in
[38:04] such a simple way
[38:05] he showed us how practically to create a
[38:09] different atmosphere
[38:10] and we take the word of god and we speak
[38:13] the word of god by faith
[38:18] in the message token brother ma'am is
[38:20] talking about the token and he's talking
[38:22] about applying the token

[38:30] ready apply it believe it

[38:34] family let your loved ones see it in you
[38:36] that's right

[38:40] token in prayer with consideration with
[38:42] believing
[38:43] apply it with such love and so forth
[38:45] until you know it's going to take it's
[38:47] going to take place that's all
[38:49] apply in confidence believing it's going
[38:51] to help when you talk to that child when
[38:53] you talk to your husband
[38:54] talk to your wife talk to this loved one
[38:57] believe that it's going to help
[38:58] just stand there and say lord i've
[39:00] claimed them they're mine
[39:02] i'm getting them for you lord apply it
[39:05] and create that atmosphere around you
[39:09] create that atmosphere around you that
[39:11] they'll just drop right in it see
[39:14] oh you you are if you've got the token
[39:17] you create a spirit around you a power
[39:20] that when you
[39:21] walk people know that you're a christian
[39:23] they love for you to say something to
[39:25] them
[39:25] they believe your word what you say they
[39:27] hold on to it see
[39:28] that's it and i'll tell you
[39:32] when brother-in-law talks about applying
[39:33] this token if you've got the token you
[39:35] create an
[39:35] atmosphere around you amen and it's an
[39:37] atmosphere of faith in the word amen
[39:40] and you created your own atmosphere
[39:43] so if you come into the room and people
[39:45] scoot out the back door
[39:48] don't blame them do you understand
[39:53] if every situation you find yourself in
[39:56] turns
[39:57] acostic at some point
[40:00] if every relationship and everything at
[40:02] some point or another i'm fighting with
[40:03] everybody around me
[40:04] and and nobody understands me and nobody
[40:07] loves me and everybody judges me
[40:11] i'd say look at the atmosphere that
[40:13] you've created
[40:16] because we want to create that
[40:17] atmosphere where people love to be
[40:18] around you they just want to talk to you
[40:20] they want you to say something to them
[40:22] why because it's the atmosphere of god
[40:25] amen they're sensing something they may
[40:26] not put it in the words but when they
[40:28] get around you and they begin to talk to
[40:29] you
[40:30] there's a calming spirit brother branham
[40:32] would feel it on the platform he says
[40:34] now
[40:34] you've got a you've got a familiar
[40:36] spirit i i sense your spirit you're
[40:38] a christian
[40:44] we create our atmosphere if we're
[40:48] if we're at odds with somebody every day
[40:55] that's the atmosphere we created it's
[40:57] not all those other people's fault
[40:59] it's us brother said i was listening to
[41:02] a message in the tape he said
[41:04] he says you only reflect what you're
[41:06] looking at or what you're pointed at
[41:09] and see sometimes we're reflecting back
[41:12] because either we're not staying with
[41:15] our mind stayed on him all the time
[41:17] we've got something else where we're
[41:19] looking at we're caught up in something
[41:20] in the world we're we're troubled by
[41:22] some other things that's going on we're
[41:23] caught up in entertainment or caught up
[41:25] in the news of the day amen we begin
[41:27] whatever we're looking at we begin to
[41:29] reflect it back
[41:32] whatever we're pointed to whatever we're
[41:34] focusing our attention on
[41:35] we begin to reflect it back amen and
[41:38] that's why it's important to keep your
[41:40] mind state on him amen
[41:42] think about him things that are lovely
[41:44] things that are just if there be any
[41:45] value
[41:46] there be any virtue think on these
[41:48] things amen
[41:49] keep your mind on christ amen when
[41:51] another thought comes push it out
[41:53] listen to the message have fellowship
[41:55] with believers be in
[41:57] church amen whatever you have to do read
[41:59] your bible pray
[42:00] keep your mind full of the word of god
[42:03] amen because there's messages
[42:04] all day every day trying to fill your
[42:06] mind with something else
[42:08] and then you've got to constantly reject
[42:10] those and fill yourself
[42:11] with the word of god all the time
[42:14] because what you what you pointed out
[42:17] what you're looking at you will begin to
[42:19] reflect
[42:20] and so keep your eyes on christ all the
[42:23] time
[42:26] now i want to go back to this quote i
[42:29] wasn't going to go here but i'm going to
[42:30] go here
[42:32] when i was looking at this quote when he
[42:34] says brother ben's talking says you
[42:35] sitting there in the wheelchair
[42:37] you that you're hopeless helpless you're
[42:40] not
[42:42] and you think about somebody who may
[42:43] have been in a wheelchair all their life
[42:44] they've got
[42:45] some physical ailment or something
[42:46] that's crippled them or held them in a
[42:48] wheelchair
[42:49] created some weakness or something uh
[42:52] and all their life
[42:53] you can easily in the flesh if you've
[42:55] lived all your life that way
[42:57] feel hopeless or helpless like it's
[43:00] i think we would all experience those
[43:02] emotions every one of us
[43:04] if you lived all your life in that
[43:05] condition and you never had the strength
[43:07] to rise above that and you've never
[43:08] known what it was to be different than
[43:10] that
[43:10] you would feel hopeless or you would
[43:12] feel helpless amen but brother brenham
[43:14] said you're not
[43:15] and i would i want to i want to look at
[43:17] a scripture together
[43:19] if we could uh look at luke i think it's
[43:21] in luke
[43:24] i think i might be able to find it yet
[43:25] luke chapter 13.
[43:32] yeah luke chapter 13. i was reading this
[43:35] the other day and when i come across it
[43:37] it just
[43:38] it hit me with such impact i began to
[43:40] realize
[43:41] some of the things i want to share like
[43:44] i said i didn't intend to go into this
[43:45] tonight but praise the lord
[43:47] anyhow luke 13 10 and when he was
[43:51] teaching in one of the synagogues on the
[43:52] sabbath
[43:53] and behold there was a woman which had a
[43:55] spirit of infirmity 18 years
[43:57] and was bowed together and could in no
[44:00] wise lift up herself
[44:02] so she is crippled she is bowed over
[44:05] like
[44:06] like hunched back they're curled over
[44:09] and bowed over and she could in no way
[44:11] straighten herself up she is she
[44:13] this is a crippled woman
[44:14] who's bowed over in the back and could
[44:16] not raise herself
[44:19] and couldn't know wise lift up herself
[44:22] and when jesus saw her he called to her
[44:24] he called her to him and said unto her
[44:27] woman thou art loosed from thine
[44:28] infirmity
[44:29] and he said and he laid his hand on her
[44:32] and immediately she was made straight
[44:34] and glorified god
[44:37] what i like about this is in verse 11
[44:41] there was a woman which had a spirit of
[44:44] infirmity
[44:48] she did not have a crippled body
[44:52] that was a spirit of infirmity that was
[44:55] reflecting in a crippled body
[45:00] you understand you understand what i'm
[45:02] trying to say
[45:03] we would look at that and say that poor
[45:05] woman she was probably born a
[45:06] she's probably a hunchback
[45:08] she's bowed over her spine is probably
[45:10] deformed i mean she
[45:12] she may she may have been disfigured she
[45:13] may have been in that condition so long
[45:15] her muscles have have molded to that
[45:17] position and she could not even raise
[45:19] herself up
[45:20] and we look at that as a physical
[45:22] condition and that is not a physical
[45:24] condition
[45:24] that is a spiritual infirmity
[45:28] and i'll tell you why that is amazing
[45:30] the reason that's amazing is because he
[45:32] hath made us
[45:33] kings and priests and we're kings over a
[45:35] spiritual dominion
[45:37] over a spiritual kingdom we're spiritual
[45:39] kings and priests
[45:40] and if that's a spiritual affirmative
[45:42] infirmity we have the power and the
[45:45] spiritual realm to exercise our dominion
[45:47] as a king and a priest over the
[45:49] spiritual realm
[45:50] and cast that thing out and reject that
[45:52] and let it go
[45:53] and not worry about how the muscles will
[45:55] work and how the spine will come back
[45:57] and it's not hopeless it's not helpless
[45:59] it's not because there's kings and
[46:01] priests on this earth
[46:02] spiritual kings and priests over a
[46:04] spiritual kingdom
[46:05] now not will be but he hath already made
[46:08] us kings and priests
[46:11] see we defeat ourselves by what our eyes
[46:14] see we see a in a wheelchair we
[46:16] see a hunchback we see a withered arm
[46:18] amen we see a club
[46:19] foot we see crossed eyes we see blind or
[46:22] deaf
[46:22] and we think oh that's a physical
[46:24] ailment they might need a surgery they
[46:26] might need that
[46:26] amen those things are brought on by
[46:28] spiritual infirmities and we can deal
[46:31] with that thing in the spirit realm
[46:37] amen is that what the scripture says
[46:40] brother jesus goes on to say they they
[46:42] condemn him for healing on the sabbath
[46:44] and he says is it wrong on the sabbath
[46:46] amen you loose your ass you lose your ox
[46:49] to take them to get water
[46:52] why couldn't i loose this being a a
[46:54] daughter of abraham lucifer from satan's
[46:56] bound
[46:57] she wasn't bound in the flesh it was a
[46:59] spiritual infirmity
[47:01] it was reflected in the flesh
[47:04] see when we start flesh flesh and see
[47:07] we're incapable
[47:09] when we keep it in the realms of flesh
[47:12] we're incapable
[47:14] we're unable we're totally we can't
[47:17] straighten the spine
[47:18] we can't stretch muscles we can't create
[47:21] we can't create eyeballs you understand
[47:24] i'm talking flesh in the flesh
[47:26] we can do nothing but in the spirit it's
[47:28] a different story
[47:30] where he's brought us to it's different
[47:32] amen we could speak to the life that's
[47:34] bringing
[47:34] crippled we can speak to that life amen
[47:37] it's bringing infirmity we can speak to
[47:39] the life that's brought a club foot and
[47:40] we can cast out that life and resist
[47:42] that life in the name of jesus christ
[47:44] and watch the flesh go to match amen the
[47:47] confession
[47:50] we have to quit being so naturally
[47:53] minded and so
[47:54] locked down by our natural uh senses and
[47:57] our natural reasoning
[47:58] and get get to the position called god
[48:01] has called us to be in
[48:02] and how are we gonna ever live there if
[48:04] we don't start speaking a different
[48:06] kind of language to create a different
[48:07] kind of atmosphere all around us
[48:10] the disciples so had that revelation of
[48:13] who they were
[48:13] and the power that was given to them
[48:15] over scorpions and serpents and all the
[48:17] power of the devil
[48:20] that when peter would walk down the road
[48:22] they would lay people in his shadow
[48:27] there was nothing physical it wasn't it
[48:30] wasn't the physical properties of a
[48:32] shadow changing something
[48:34] physical in their body amen it was
[48:35] driving spirits away from people
[48:40] and we may be weak in the flesh may we
[48:43] be incapable in our mind we may not have
[48:45] strength in our arms or intelligence
[48:46] enough to fix
[48:47] things amen but that's not our condition
[48:50] in the spirit realm
[48:51] spiritually we're warriors mighty
[48:53] gentile warriors
[48:54] we've been restored amen we've been
[48:56] brought back amen by the grace of god
[48:58] and by the plan of redemption we are
[49:00] now kings and priests over a spiritual
[49:02] dominion
[49:06] we have to create that atmosphere that
[49:08] brings
[49:09] changes and quit
[49:12] speaking things we see and start
[49:16] speaking things we believe
[49:20] if we only speak what we see we're never
[49:23] going to see anything
[49:26] because we're going to have to wait till
[49:28] we see something to confess it
[49:30] but that's absolutely backwards to the
[49:32] reality we have to confess something
[49:34] before we see it
[49:38] we have to stick with the word
[49:42] so brother-in-law says you in that
[49:43] wheelchair you're not hopeless
[49:45] you're not help you think you're
[49:46] hopeless you think your help is you're
[49:48] not
[49:49] whatever the physical condition whatever
[49:53] the infirmity
[49:54] the physical condition the the
[49:56] limitation whatever the
[49:58] the cycle we've been in whatever the
[50:00] family situation whatever
[50:02] the work whatever finance whatever i
[50:04] don't care what it is
[50:05] amen you're not hopeless you're not
[50:08] helpless
[50:08] if you can take the battle out of the
[50:10] natural to the spiritual
[50:12] amen you'll find that there's an
[50:14] overcomer living within you
[50:18] but we gotta we gotta rise above the
[50:20] natural
[50:22] brother braham says in the spoken word
[50:25] is the original
[50:26] seed it says in a real seed of god is an
[50:28] absorbent for the spirit
[50:30] all denominationalism is took out all
[50:32] unbelief is out and when the holy spirit
[50:34] comes into that germ of life that's
[50:36] laying there it produces another seed
[50:38] just exactly
[50:39] another son of god is born amen another
[50:42] amateur god son of god when the holy
[50:46] ghost comes in
[50:47] quickens the seed on the inside it's
[50:49] another amateur god
[50:54] he's not talking about will be
[50:57] he's talking about the new birth is
[50:59] birthed why it's
[51:01] birth the creation of god a son of god
[51:03] an offspring of god
[51:04] an amateur god
[51:09] amen the the heathen caught this faster
[51:12] than the jews
[51:14] because when paul and barnabas went to
[51:16] the heathens amen and they began to heal
[51:18] amen they brought offerings to them and
[51:20] bowed down and said the gods have come
[51:22] down from heaven unto us they recognize
[51:24] that these are
[51:25] gods that come down from heaven amen and
[51:27] you know what
[51:28] they weren't far from the truth they
[51:30] just had the wrong gods they thought it
[51:32] was
[51:32] they thought it was jupiter and they
[51:34] thought it was mercury or mars
[51:36] they didn't realize that these are just
[51:38] offspring of the one and true god
[51:40] amen so they raised them up and said
[51:42] don't you sacrifice those animals
[51:43] don't you worship us in the flesh you
[51:45] worship god
[51:48] because that's who we're part of
[51:53] the heathen caught it the jews missed it
[51:57] and i don't want to be like the jews i
[51:59] don't want to miss it amen
[52:00] when the new birth takes place there's
[52:02] an amateur god on the scene
[52:05] brother man said i'm a branham because i
[52:07] was born of charlie
[52:08] and elebranum that makes me a branham
[52:11] because of their seed their two
[52:12] agreements
[52:13] with their sperm together made a seed
[52:15] and that made me
[52:16] when god in his word becomes one
[52:19] hallelujah
[52:20] when god's spirit waters the seed of god
[52:22] the word of god
[52:23] it produces god
[52:27] it produces god and it's not the
[52:30] individual
[52:32] it's god
[52:36] that's why we don't even pay attention
[52:38] to the flesh the flesh feels bad
[52:40] i don't care the flesh doubts in the
[52:42] mind i'm not paying attention
[52:44] it's not the individual it's god and i'm
[52:46] paying attention to the god on the
[52:47] inside
[52:48] amen that's who i want to identify with
[52:50] because that's who i really am down deep
[52:52] so if my mind says something contrary
[52:54] forget it amen that's not who i
[52:56] am if my flesh begins to rebel
[53:00] amen i don't care amen that is not who i
[53:03] am it's not the individual it's god
[53:07] for what you are dead you're not
[53:09] yourself no more you reckon yourself
[53:11] dead
[53:12] hallowed hollowed out waiting for the
[53:14] seed germ then what is it
[53:16] it isn't you no more it isn't the man
[53:18] it's god
[53:19] in the man it's the seed germ like the
[53:22] beginning
[53:22] spoken word it's god's word made
[53:25] manifest in a man
[53:27] then it isn't the man it's a man that's
[53:29] died he could be a hybrid and a son at
[53:32] the same time
[53:33] he can't be a hybrid and a son at the
[53:35] same time he's either a son
[53:37] of death or a son of life so he was the
[53:40] son of death
[53:40] get over to the devil and let him kill
[53:42] it i mean give over to god
[53:44] i meant and let him kill the devil
[53:46] that's in you run him out
[53:47] hollows you out then let god plant his
[53:50] own life in you
[53:51] then it's not you no more it's god's
[53:53] life
[53:55] because it's god's word watered by the
[53:57] holy spirit will produce the same thing
[53:59] you see it he says now in
[54:02] the message jehovah jireh is now now
[54:05] here he is among his
[54:06] church today made flesh in his church
[54:08] certainly elohim
[54:10] now oh if you could only realize that
[54:12] you men
[54:14] you were made to be an amateur god
[54:19] the fall took us out of our rightful
[54:22] position but you were made to
[54:24] be a god upon the earth that is god's
[54:27] original
[54:28] intent for his sons and daughters upon
[54:30] the earth to be to be gods upon the
[54:32] earth
[54:34] you were made to be an amateur god
[54:36] you're a son of god
[54:37] you're an heir of god and you have a
[54:39] domain
[54:40] genesis 1 26 he give him dominion over
[54:43] everything in the earth he made him a
[54:45] god over the earth that's right
[54:46] he give him a domain he's a king god
[54:49] and where he got his fall he could speak
[54:52] to trees
[54:53] be changed plucked up and said over here
[54:55] to the winds and waves be still and be
[54:57] stopped
[54:58] it was god an amateur god a son of god
[55:00] like you're a son
[55:01] of your father and all the world is
[55:04] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[55:06] of the sons of god
[55:07] waiting for the church to get back in
[55:10] its place again
[55:13] sons of god to be made manifest waiting
[55:15] for that hour
[55:16] hope that don't hurt but i just had to
[55:18] say it see
[55:20] the church is so far away from its place
[55:22] it needs to be back to be sons of god
[55:24] again
[55:25] rulers governors of the earth under the
[55:27] spiritual reign it will be someday
[55:29] when the chief one comes jesus christ
[55:31] the great millennium
[55:32] nature's groaning for that day
[55:37] god god intended for us to be
[55:41] gods offspring of god amateur gods
[55:45] he has now made us kings and priests
[55:48] over a spiritual dominion
[55:50] we do not have to live in a bad
[55:53] atmosphere
[55:55] we do not have to accept that everything
[55:58] the devil throws our way every thought
[56:00] in our mind every doubt
[56:01] every confusion every ache and every
[56:05] pain and every symptom
[56:08] we don't have to accept it we may have
[56:10] to suffer through it but we don't have
[56:11] to accept it
[56:13] we can challenge that thing we can
[56:16] challenge the spirit behind that thing
[56:20] see it's like when you have somebody who
[56:23] gets irate with you i could be in the
[56:25] grocery store because you get in line in
[56:27] front of them or
[56:27] or they could be just i mean smoke
[56:29] rolling out of the ears because you got
[56:30] the last roll of toilet paper
[56:32] you know we were in that atmosphere
[56:35] earlier this year
[56:37] or because you didn't notice them and
[56:39] pulled out in front of them and they
[56:41] curve around you and make bad hand
[56:43] gestures at you and yell and
[56:45] all of those things amen when you
[56:47] realize that's not that person
[56:51] i'm not even going to look at the flesh
[56:53] that's a spirit
[56:55] amen those angry words amen that's
[56:58] i'm not even going i'm not even going to
[57:02] go
[57:02] there amen because there's a spirit
[57:04] behind that
[57:05] and that spirit is trying to get to me
[57:07] as a son of god
[57:08] and trying to get me to confess
[57:10] something other than the word
[57:13] so many times amen we feel justified
[57:17] in responding to criticism responding to
[57:20] angry words responding
[57:21] to hatred and malice and all these
[57:24] things because it's so over the top
[57:26] sometimes
[57:26] sometimes you do something this big and
[57:28] the response you get is this big
[57:30] and you have to realize it's not that
[57:31] person there's a spirit there trying to
[57:33] get to me a son of god
[57:35] and i'm not going to take the devil's
[57:37] baits
[57:39] so the next time somebody gets smoking
[57:40] hot at you say i'm i'm really sorry can
[57:43] i buy you a cup of coffee
[57:46] they may be dead wrong every which way
[57:49] they're wrong
[57:49] amen just tell them they're right and
[57:51] reach in your wallet and give them 20
[57:52] bucks and tell them you love them
[57:54] because it's not them and you telling
[57:56] them the truth is not going to fix the
[57:57] situation
[57:58] and you repairing their bad attitude or
[58:00] correcting their wrong statement isn't
[58:02] going to fix it
[58:03] there's a spirit back there and if you
[58:05] do something like that you'll drive that
[58:07] spirit right
[58:08] out of that person the devil's trying to
[58:12] get us
[58:12] out of this atmosphere and bring us down
[58:14] into this atmosphere
[58:16] and i've taken the bait so many times i
[58:18] don't want to take it anymore
[58:21] it's like a mother at home amen all of a
[58:23] sudden everything will be going wrong
[58:24] the noodles are boiling over on the
[58:26] stove the baby's crying two of them are
[58:29] pulling each other's hair out over there
[58:30] it's not the baby and it's not the stove
[58:33] it's a spirit trying to get to you amen
[58:37] brother branham came in that situation
[58:39] at his home and then he had visitors all
[58:41] day long and the house was a wreck and
[58:42] the kids were fighting over blocks
[58:44] his wife was upset haven't fed the kids
[58:46] all day had company
[58:47] she's in turmoil amen and she she's not
[58:50] being
[58:51] uh sweet and submissive she's being
[58:53] frustrated and upset
[58:54] and and troubled his kids aren't running
[58:57] up and say daddy daddy you're the
[58:59] greatest thing on the earth
[59:02] but he walked in there and he realized
[59:04] that this
[59:05] situation is trying to get to the
[59:07] ministry amen i've been helping people
[59:09] all day and the devil's out here
[59:10] attacking my family trying to get to me
[59:12] and he didn't address you know calm down
[59:14] sweetheart don't talk that way
[59:19] you two kids you hush up over there
[59:22] what he did is he stepped in as an
[59:23] amateur god
[59:25] and he said i'm going to change this
[59:28] atmosphere
[59:30] and he tells us he did he tells us about
[59:32] it multiple times he went in and put on
[59:34] an apron he started washing dishes
[59:36] amen he did start quoting scriptures
[59:39] he started talking about a dress they
[59:40] buy for his wife and he said
[59:42] then he didn't even address the kids
[59:44] fighting over the blocks you understand
[59:45] that
[59:46] he addressed his wife he calmed her
[59:49] spirit
[59:50] he came with a calm spirit he had an
[59:52] atmosphere around him
[59:53] that calmed his wife he said pretty soon
[59:55] the kids had calmed down and were
[59:57] playing with blocks
[1:00:00] the house was in order and the best part
[1:00:03] is his wife told him
[1:00:04] quit helping me with the dishes i've got
[1:00:06] it
[1:00:12] it's good to be an amateur god
[1:00:15] because if he had handled that wrong he
[1:00:16] might have been doing dishes for a long
[1:00:18] long long time
[1:00:21] but you see brother benham he shows us
[1:00:23] these things they're demonstrated in his
[1:00:24] life
[1:00:25] so that we can see it's not necessarily
[1:00:27] about i've got to make everything right
[1:00:29] line everything up
[1:00:30] i just got to bring as an amateur god
[1:00:32] i've got to create another atmosphere
[1:00:33] amen and there's a power that is
[1:00:35] emanating out of the children of god
[1:00:37] to create another atmosphere
[1:00:40] and so many times i mean just in family
[1:00:42] life
[1:00:43] and i i have no intention of talking
[1:00:45] about family life tonight but praise god
[1:00:46] here we are
[1:00:48] just in family life there's traps all
[1:00:50] around trying to get the family from up
[1:00:52] here to down here
[1:00:54] always trying to get your home and your
[1:00:56] family amen because your family your
[1:00:58] home is the atmosphere where your
[1:01:00] children can be born again
[1:01:01] amen because birth takes place in the
[1:01:03] right atmosphere
[1:01:04] so the devil is constantly trying to
[1:01:06] disrupt your home atmosphere
[1:01:10] and if we go in there with the wrong
[1:01:11] attitude and not realize what the
[1:01:13] devil's trying to do
[1:01:14] we're going to cause a greater
[1:01:16] disruption to the atmosphere
[1:01:20] because we ride in with a posse on a
[1:01:22] horse and a big gun
[1:01:25] and we start fighting fleshly things in
[1:01:27] fleshly ways
[1:01:30] instead of just bringing a different
[1:01:31] atmosphere
[1:01:34] instead of just coming in calm and quiet
[1:01:37] and recognizing what the devil's trying
[1:01:39] to do
[1:01:41] this is not this is not because my
[1:01:43] children
[1:01:44] are disrespectful they're always
[1:01:46] respectful
[1:01:47] that something's going on this isn't
[1:01:50] because my wife hates me she loves me
[1:01:52] this isn't because my husband doesn't
[1:01:53] love me he loves me something else is
[1:01:55] going on
[1:01:58] and if we could recognize those things
[1:02:00] and actually
[1:02:01] speak the word live the word create that
[1:02:03] atmosphere and have confidence and
[1:02:04] atmosphere
[1:02:05] you'll find that that atmosphere begins
[1:02:07] to change situations
[1:02:09] it'll change situations at work it'll
[1:02:11] change situations
[1:02:12] wherever you go you ever find yourself
[1:02:14] in the grocery store
[1:02:15] and somebody just wants to keep talking
[1:02:17] to you
[1:02:18] have you ever been there they talk to
[1:02:20] you and they want to keep talking to you
[1:02:22] and it's like i've got to go but they
[1:02:23] want to keep talking to you
[1:02:24] you realize if you had the awareness of
[1:02:26] what's going on in the spirit realm
[1:02:27] amen you have no idea that that presence
[1:02:30] that they feel when they come near you
[1:02:32] is something they're longing for
[1:02:34] they don't feel it here and they don't
[1:02:36] feel it there and they may never feel it
[1:02:37] at home
[1:02:38] but they come into an atmosphere around
[1:02:39] you that's different and they just want
[1:02:41] to say hello
[1:02:42] how are you then they want to show you
[1:02:44] pictures of their grandchildren
[1:02:48] and we could get irritated about that or
[1:02:49] we could understand
[1:02:51] this is probably the most peaceful
[1:02:52] feeling they've had all week
[1:02:57] if we just could be aware of who we are
[1:03:01] and what god's trying to do through us
[1:03:04] it it's different we get so accustomed
[1:03:07] to ourselves and so accustomed to each
[1:03:08] other
[1:03:09] i remember the first time i come to
[1:03:12] church and heard the saints worship and
[1:03:13] everybody sing with their whole heart
[1:03:16] it floored me it floored me
[1:03:20] i'm i was used to a worship team up
[1:03:22] front and everybody sitting and watching
[1:03:23] the worship team and a few
[1:03:25] congregational songs and we were pretty
[1:03:26] happy when they were done
[1:03:28] especially if they weren't fast enough
[1:03:33] and when i come into a service where the
[1:03:36] atmosphere was different
[1:03:38] where the whole congregation was singing
[1:03:40] and they were seeing with their whole
[1:03:41] heart
[1:03:42] and you felt like they meant every word
[1:03:44] they said
[1:03:46] it floored me and i don't think we get
[1:03:49] so accustomed to it we don't realize
[1:03:51] when the visitor comes in there's
[1:03:52] something that's shocking
[1:03:55] to them we create a different atmosphere
[1:03:58] if we could just be aware of that we
[1:04:00] could benefit from that
[1:04:03] brother brahm says in the message it is
[1:04:04] the rising of the sun
[1:04:07] and so is it today we don't try to be
[1:04:09] some big person we don't care
[1:04:11] what the people say about us our name
[1:04:13] ain't nothing it's his name
[1:04:16] our life it's nothing it's his life
[1:04:19] it's his power not our power
[1:04:23] and there's only one thing that we love
[1:04:24] to do is see him glorified
[1:04:29] how can it be when he's glorified in us
[1:04:33] by his resurrection that's in us we see
[1:04:36] him represented again as he was today
[1:04:38] did you get that see our desire is not
[1:04:40] to be glorified
[1:04:42] our desire is not some big name our
[1:04:44] desire is not to
[1:04:46] boost some church or make more in this
[1:04:48] sunday school or try to bring in a
[1:04:49] hog tie push in offer a picnic party or
[1:04:52] bring stars buttons or something else
[1:04:54] like that
[1:04:54] that's not our desire our desire is to
[1:04:57] see him glorified
[1:04:59] glorified what not with self-pride but
[1:05:02] in us
[1:05:03] our lives to prove he is alive and
[1:05:05] living in us
[1:05:08] we this creating an atmosphere this
[1:05:10] amateur god
[1:05:11] it's not about the individuals not the
[1:05:13] individual it's god
[1:05:15] and if we could just release ourselves
[1:05:17] to god's life in us and let god have
[1:05:19] control
[1:05:19] and let god's life be forefront and let
[1:05:21] our life be secondary we'll see more
[1:05:23] things friends
[1:05:26] you know jesus when he was when he was
[1:05:28] here on the earth
[1:05:29] he would open blinded eyes and after he
[1:05:31] opened the blinded eyes he said see that
[1:05:33] you tell no man
[1:05:36] he wasn't doing it for his glory he was
[1:05:39] following the commandments of the lord
[1:05:41] and when our primary objective is for
[1:05:43] him to be glorified
[1:05:45] i believe with all my heart we'll see
[1:05:47] more
[1:05:48] when there's no more pride and there's
[1:05:50] no more self-vindication
[1:05:52] amen i i want i want and i long to get
[1:05:55] to the place
[1:05:56] where we can see somebody struggling and
[1:05:58] we can tell them about divine healing
[1:05:59] and they ask for prayer
[1:06:00] and we lay hands on them and blind eyes
[1:06:03] open somebody crippled walk a foot
[1:06:04] strains or whatever
[1:06:06] and we thank god for that and they go
[1:06:08] testifying and we
[1:06:09] don't tell nobody
[1:06:15] i long for that day i long for the day
[1:06:18] where god can come down and manifest
[1:06:20] and he's the only one who gets the
[1:06:22] credit that i realize
[1:06:23] that i'm so i'm so incapable in my flesh
[1:06:26] that the individual is dead and i have
[1:06:28] no ability or capability that if
[1:06:30] anything happened it was god anyways
[1:06:34] i tell you i i've had trouble sometimes
[1:06:37] where i've come to the pulpit so tore up
[1:06:39] in my spirit
[1:06:40] i was in the back crying and begging god
[1:06:42] not to make me come out and preach
[1:06:45] that i was on the verge of playing a
[1:06:47] tape and i'll come out
[1:06:48] and i'll preach and during the whole
[1:06:50] sermon i'm not edified and i'm still
[1:06:52] troubled in my spirit
[1:06:54] and i and i preach just what god's given
[1:06:56] me and it doesn't it does it's not doing
[1:06:58] anything for me
[1:06:59] i'll just preach it and that'll be the
[1:07:01] very service somebody will come and say
[1:07:03] you said word for word what we talked
[1:07:05] about on the way to church
[1:07:06] it was like you were in our home amen
[1:07:09] and all i can say is
[1:07:11] i don't know i was in the back crying i
[1:07:13] didn't want to preach
[1:07:14] i wanted to play a tape
[1:07:18] you understand when we can get to the
[1:07:20] place where we recognize it's not
[1:07:22] us it's him but when we recognize it's
[1:07:24] him and let it be him
[1:07:25] and get with his program and say what he
[1:07:27] said say and do what he said do
[1:07:29] we'll see more and more and more when we
[1:07:31] quit waiting for the feelings to match
[1:07:33] when we quit waiting until we feel good
[1:07:35] to confess and feel good to preach
[1:07:37] feel good to pray when we can just get
[1:07:41] in the program and say
[1:07:42] it's not my life it is if i'm having the
[1:07:44] worst day of my life and this person
[1:07:45] wants to hear about god
[1:07:46] i'm going to let myself be dead and tell
[1:07:48] them about god i'm going to tell them
[1:07:50] there's a healer
[1:07:51] even if i'm sick in my body even if i'm
[1:07:53] suffering with symptoms
[1:07:54] i'm going to tell them there's a god who
[1:07:56] heals and i can lay hands on you and
[1:07:58] you'll be well
[1:07:58] because brother branham did it standing
[1:08:00] in the pulpit so sick he could hardly
[1:08:02] stand up but he was still
[1:08:04] doing what god told him to do it wasn't
[1:08:06] him it's not the individual
[1:08:08] it was god it was an amateur god upon
[1:08:11] the earth
[1:08:15] i want the same thing in my life where i
[1:08:17] look so to that life
[1:08:18] and that might be dead i could be
[1:08:20] troubled in my mind having problems at
[1:08:22] home
[1:08:23] financially and ruin whatever is going
[1:08:26] on but if there's somebody there and
[1:08:27] they ask a question i'm telling them
[1:08:28] about the word
[1:08:29] if they need prayer i'm laying hands on
[1:08:31] them and praying on for them
[1:08:33] because that's what we're here it's not
[1:08:35] the individual it's god
[1:08:37] it's the life on the inside it's not the
[1:08:39] outer man
[1:08:46] back to this quote and it's the rising
[1:08:47] of the sun
[1:08:51] but he's in us not with self-pride but
[1:08:53] in us our lives to prove he is alive and
[1:08:55] living in us
[1:08:56] if i can get myself out of the way
[1:08:59] so when william branham not even thought
[1:09:02] of
[1:09:04] and you not even thought of till we can
[1:09:07] see
[1:09:07] jesus glorified among us see him
[1:09:11] that's our desire see gives us
[1:09:14] quickening power and it gives us joy to
[1:09:16] know that we are with him
[1:09:18] both flesh and bone of him being the
[1:09:20] bride of him and seeing his same
[1:09:22] vindicated methods proving in us
[1:09:24] that he is now risen from the dead no
[1:09:27] wonder he said fear not for now notice
[1:09:29] we are redeemed by him and now risen
[1:09:31] with him that's what easter means to the
[1:09:33] people risen with him
[1:09:35] now we have his spirit in us the
[1:09:36] abstract deed fully paid
[1:09:39] no you don't say well i hope i make it
[1:09:41] you've already
[1:09:43] made it not i will make it i've already
[1:09:46] made it
[1:09:47] i never made it he made it for me see
[1:09:49] not me him
[1:09:50] well brother branham they say i don't
[1:09:52] care what they say
[1:09:54] there he made it for me that's all i
[1:09:56] want i'm caring about
[1:09:58] just want to see him manifested how can
[1:10:01] you do it
[1:10:02] call him down no he's in you
[1:10:07] how can i see him manifested how can i
[1:10:09] see him glorified
[1:10:10] amen all i want to do is seem glorified
[1:10:12] he said the only way he'll be glorified
[1:10:13] is to be glorified in you
[1:10:16] i want to see him glorified i want to
[1:10:17] see him manifest how will you do it call
[1:10:19] him down
[1:10:19] no you're not going to call him down
[1:10:21] he's in you
[1:10:25] see he's in you well then lord if i can
[1:10:27] get myself
[1:10:28] out of the way you can manifest
[1:10:31] how can you do it because you ordained
[1:10:33] us so all that the father has given me
[1:10:35] will come
[1:10:36] hallelujah
[1:10:40] let's turn together to john 14.
[1:10:47] john 14 and 6.
[1:10:59] jesus saith unto him i am the way the
[1:11:01] truth the life no man cometh unto the
[1:11:02] father but by me
[1:11:05] if you had known me you should have
[1:11:06] known my father also and from henceforth
[1:11:08] you know him and have seen him
[1:11:10] philip saith in him lord show us the
[1:11:12] father and it sufficeth us
[1:11:14] jesus said in them have i been so long
[1:11:16] time with you
[1:11:17] and yet hast thou not known me philip he
[1:11:20] that has seen me had seen the father
[1:11:22] and how saith then show us the father
[1:11:25] believeth now not that i am in the
[1:11:27] father and the father in me
[1:11:29] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[1:11:31] not of myself
[1:11:32] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:11:34] doeth the works
[1:11:37] even jesus could get himself out of the
[1:11:39] way
[1:11:40] and notice it's not me but it's him that
[1:11:43] dwelleth in me
[1:11:45] it's not me to do with the words it's my
[1:11:47] father that dwelleth in me
[1:11:48] he doeth the works let's go down to
[1:11:50] verse 18.
[1:11:53] jesus says i will not leave you
[1:11:54] comfortless i will come to you
[1:11:57] yet a little while and the world sees me
[1:11:59] no more but ye see me because i live
[1:12:01] you shall live also at that day
[1:12:04] you shall know that i am in my father
[1:12:06] and ye and me
[1:12:08] and i in you and then you can say
[1:12:12] it's not me that do the works it's
[1:12:14] christ that's in me
[1:12:21] in the message perfect faith i wanna
[1:12:24] i wanna pay close attention to this as
[1:12:26] we wind down to a close here
[1:12:28] perfect faith but jesus lived in a world
[1:12:32] that no one knowed about
[1:12:34] he was an odd person he lived in a world
[1:12:37] of perfect faith in the perfect god
[1:12:39] in which he was if we live in a
[1:12:42] perfect faith of a christian
[1:12:45] oh my goodness let's read it again
[1:12:51] because this next statement is is one
[1:12:53] that blows us out of the water
[1:12:56] jesus lived in a world that no one
[1:12:58] knowed about he was an odd person he
[1:13:00] lived in a world of perfect faith
[1:13:02] in the perfect god in which he was
[1:13:06] understand he was there god and flesh he
[1:13:09] said he believed in the perfect
[1:13:12] i had perfect faith and a perfect god in
[1:13:14] which he was
[1:13:16] now he's going to take it to the church
[1:13:18] and then take it to you and i
[1:13:20] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:13:22] christian
[1:13:23] to what we are
[1:13:27] christ said to recognize what he was we
[1:13:29] have to recognize what we
[1:13:30] are if we can live in a perfect faith of
[1:13:33] a christian to what we are
[1:13:35] we'd be a mystic to the world the people
[1:13:38] wouldn't understand you
[1:13:40] you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit
[1:13:42] said you would do
[1:13:44] what it forbid you would not do then the
[1:13:46] people begin to say you'd be a
[1:13:47] mystic person to them that's the way it
[1:13:50] is to all believers they're a mystic
[1:13:52] the people don't understand because they
[1:13:54] live in a world to themselves
[1:13:55] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:13:57] could touch the disciples couldn't
[1:13:59] understand
[1:14:00] them when he spoke to them they say they
[1:14:02] say this and then they said
[1:14:04] why you talking riddles we don't
[1:14:06] understand this
[1:14:07] how can this be see they wasn't in the
[1:14:09] world that he lived in
[1:14:10] they couldn't understand them nobody
[1:14:12] could understand them
[1:14:14] and so when a man lives by faith and
[1:14:16] walks by faith i mean
[1:14:17] substance faith he is isolated from the
[1:14:20] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:14:22] in christ
[1:14:23] there now you're getting into bride
[1:14:26] material
[1:14:27] so how do you get in the bride material
[1:14:28] let's read it again when a man lives by
[1:14:30] faith and walks by faith i mean
[1:14:32] substance faith he is isolated from the
[1:14:35] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:14:37] in christ
[1:14:37] there now you're getting into bride
[1:14:40] material
[1:14:42] see you're getting into raptured
[1:14:44] condition rapturing condition
[1:14:46] now that means for each one of us not
[1:14:48] just the pastor deacon's trustees that
[1:14:50] means for the laity
[1:14:52] every individual walks in a world with
[1:14:54] god alone
[1:14:56] you're baptized into this kingdom and
[1:14:57] there's nobody in there but
[1:14:59] you and god
[1:15:02] he gives the orders and you pack them
[1:15:04] out whatever he says there's not a
[1:15:05] shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right
[1:15:07] on
[1:15:07] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[1:15:09] the world can talk you out of it
[1:15:10] you go right on just the same now you're
[1:15:13] coming into perfect faith
[1:15:14] perfect perfection that cannot fail then
[1:15:17] that faith never fails yes
[1:15:19] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[1:15:21] faith and so is it now that those
[1:15:24] who have perfect faith are a mystic to
[1:15:26] others
[1:15:28] i want to be a mystic to the world i
[1:15:30] want them to know
[1:15:31] when the world is falling apart and the
[1:15:33] nation is failing and riots are breaking
[1:15:35] on the street
[1:15:36] i want them to know why are you humming
[1:15:38] that little tune
[1:15:40] why are you still smiling and waving at
[1:15:42] me when everybody has their head down
[1:15:44] and everybody's so distraught
[1:15:45] and we're so worried about what's going
[1:15:47] to happen next amen i'm not worried
[1:15:49] about what's going to happen next the
[1:15:50] next step is already ordered for me
[1:15:52] amen and i'm going to walk in that step
[1:15:54] by faith he who orders my steps has
[1:15:57] ordered my next step
[1:15:58] amen if the government collapses
[1:16:00] tomorrow if russia shows up on the
[1:16:02] border and sets a new government
[1:16:04] nothing's wrong with me
[1:16:08] can there be hardship yes could it be
[1:16:10] difficulty yes may we have to deal with
[1:16:11] things
[1:16:12] absolutely but there's nothing out of
[1:16:14] kilter nothing's wrong with me
[1:16:16] i'm still walking in the same world i
[1:16:18] walked in yesterday
[1:16:19] amen if everything changes amen and the
[1:16:22] 401 case
[1:16:23] fail and the stock market crashes and
[1:16:25] there's no more employment
[1:16:26] i want to walk in the same world before
[1:16:29] the crash that i walk in after the crash
[1:16:31] i don't want it to change my atmosphere
[1:16:33] my world amen the dimension that i
[1:16:36] choose to live in
[1:16:39] all those things affect the outer men
[1:16:41] but i do not want them to hinder the
[1:16:43] inner man
[1:16:46] let's go to galatians chapter 4.
[1:16:53] galatians chapter 4.
[1:17:06] i'm going to read verse 19.
[1:17:10] my little children whom i travail in
[1:17:12] birth again
[1:17:14] until christ be formed in you
[1:17:18] the apostle paul was travailing
[1:17:21] to try to get christ formed in the
[1:17:24] church
[1:17:25] because that was the goal christ formed
[1:17:28] in you christ
[1:17:32] in the church christ in the bride form
[1:17:36] paul started it paul desired it paul was
[1:17:39] laboring and travailing to get christ
[1:17:41] formed into the church
[1:17:42] now we've come to the end time with
[1:17:44] another prophet who has brought us
[1:17:46] to this realization of christ in you the
[1:17:49] hope of glory
[1:17:50] christ in the formation of the bride
[1:17:52] christ formed
[1:17:53] in you it's not i that liveth it's
[1:17:56] christ that dwelleth in
[1:17:58] me it's not my life it's his life
[1:18:01] amen it's not the old man that's dead
[1:18:03] but this is god there's an amateur god
[1:18:05] on the earth and it's not me my mind
[1:18:06] it's not me my emotions but
[1:18:08] but it's god amen it's the real me it's
[1:18:10] the portion of god he intended to be me
[1:18:12] it's alive on the earth it's christ
[1:18:14] formed in me
[1:18:16] and it creates its own atmosphere man
[1:18:18] and while i align with the word
[1:18:20] and i allow and i force my thoughts to
[1:18:22] match the word i reject every thought
[1:18:24] that doesn't match the word when i
[1:18:25] ignore my emotions when i ignore my
[1:18:27] symptoms and i stick with the word
[1:18:29] amen it's creating an atmosphere
[1:18:32] all around
[1:18:36] i want to read this last quote
[1:18:40] and then there's the rising of the sun
[1:18:43] brother is praying and he says in the
[1:18:44] mechanics by going in the dynamics come
[1:18:47] from above the holy spirit
[1:18:48] and catch them away lord quicken their
[1:18:51] mortal body
[1:18:52] then we shall hear genuine new tongues
[1:18:54] powers of god
[1:18:56] love untold dying grace and living grace
[1:18:59] and a resurrected christ a body
[1:19:03] a bride representing him on earth
[1:19:08] what's that what is the resurrected
[1:19:10] christ a body
[1:19:12] a bride representing him on earth
[1:19:16] this is the rising of the sun this is
[1:19:18] the resurrection
[1:19:20] it's not the it's god it's not you it's
[1:19:22] the god on the inside of you
[1:19:26] we have to say what the word says
[1:19:30] deny the old man stay in that creative
[1:19:34] atmosphere of power all the time
[1:19:39] let's finish with second thessalonians
[1:19:42] 2 thessalonians chapter 1 we'll read
[1:19:44] this as the musicians make their way up
[1:19:46] and brother ben
[1:19:48] let's read this together
[1:19:51] thessalonians 2 thessalonians
[1:19:54] chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:19:58] therefore also we pray always for you
[1:20:01] that our god would count you worthy of
[1:20:02] this calling and fulfill all the good
[1:20:04] pleasure of his goodness
[1:20:06] in the work of faith with power that the
[1:20:09] name of our lord jesus christ may be
[1:20:10] glorified
[1:20:12] in you and ye
[1:20:16] in him i in you you and me
[1:20:20] in that day you shall know i am the
[1:20:23] father the father me i
[1:20:24] in you and you and me and in this day
[1:20:27] the name of our lord jesus may be
[1:20:29] glorified in you
[1:20:30] and ye in him according to the grace of
[1:20:34] our god
[1:20:35] and the lord jesus christ i said god
[1:20:40] help me to create an atmosphere by the
[1:20:44] spoken word
[1:20:46] god is still god has still set us in
[1:20:48] free moral agency he's still given us
[1:20:50] the ability to choose what we will speak
[1:20:52] choose what we accept as thoughts and if
[1:20:54] we can choose the word
[1:20:55] we will see the rise of immature gods
[1:20:58] upon me
[1:21:00] if god gets all the credit and god gets
[1:21:02] all the glory and i can let myself be
[1:21:03] nothing
[1:21:04] to william branham or chad lamb or
[1:21:06] anybody else has not even thought of but
[1:21:07] it's christ glorified
[1:21:09] it's the word amen front and center then
[1:21:11] we're going to see
[1:21:12] more of the supernatural of god because
[1:21:15] god will not share his glory with any
[1:21:17] man he's not going to do something to
[1:21:18] vindicate you so that you can feel
[1:21:20] special about yourself
[1:21:21] he's going to fulfill his purpose his
[1:21:23] word and he's going to keep it for his
[1:21:24] own glory
[1:21:26] when we can get in that same channel of
[1:21:28] thinking so it's all about him and not
[1:21:29] about us
[1:21:30] it's not about having the right ministry
[1:21:31] or the right church or being the right
[1:21:33] person amen it's just about
[1:21:35] him it's about the word it's about
[1:21:37] professing the word claiming the word
[1:21:39] walking in the word
[1:21:39] creating an atmosphere of power it'll
[1:21:43] change
[1:21:44] it'll change circumstances all around us
[1:21:46] friends
[1:21:47] we have the power to create an
[1:21:49] atmosphere
[1:21:50] we create brother ben said we create the
[1:21:52] atmosphere we live in
[1:21:55] let's all stand

[1:22:08] can you change it's because of your
[1:22:09] parents

[1:22:11] because of your wife it's because
[1:22:14] brother branham said you create the
[1:22:16] atmosphere you live in
[1:22:18] if you're not happy with the atmosphere
[1:22:20] you live in create a new one
[1:22:23] how do i do it never speak a negative
[1:22:26] thought and never let a negative
[1:22:29] confession come out of your mouth
[1:22:30] speak the word and let the word create
[1:22:33] the atmosphere
[1:22:35] we live in such a world in such a
[1:22:36] society that
[1:22:38] and it's getting more complex
[1:22:41] it's getting more perplexed
[1:22:45] that when they come into an atmosphere
[1:22:47] that's not afraid
[1:22:49] that's not nervous that's not scared
[1:22:51] that's not worried about the future
[1:22:53] i'm telling you friends that is going to

[1:27:58] problems
[1:27:59] we're going to reflect back troubles and
[1:28:01] problems
[1:28:04] but oh if we could be the woman elisha
[1:28:06] amen
[1:28:07] saw a woman a shunammite woman who made
[1:28:09] a room for him and
[1:28:11] and she had no child and by the by the
[1:28:14] ministry of elijah she receives a child
[1:28:17] a promised word amen manifest in her

[1:28:28] back to the word for her day back to the

[1:28:47] i'm not where i want to be i'm not what
[1:28:50] i ought to be but thank god i'm not what
[1:28:52] i used to be
[1:28:52] but i want to get to the place that no
[1:28:54] matter what the condition is in the
[1:28:56] natural
[1:28:56] my confession is all as well all is well
[1:29:00] everything is as it should be god is
[1:29:03] good he's on the throne he's in my life
[1:29:05] i'm redeemed i'm a child of god and all
[1:29:08] is well
[1:29:08] i'm blessed beyond measure by the truth
[1:29:11] that he's revealed to me
[1:29:12] i've seen my inheritance i'm going to it
[1:29:14] in full measure
[1:29:15] i don't care amen what i have to pass

[1:29:47] wonder what's going on
[1:29:50] they're going to through the same things
[1:29:52] i'm going through
[1:29:53] but it affects them different because
[1:29:56] there's a creator on the inside an
[1:29:58] amateur god
[1:29:59] that's creating a different atmosphere
[1:30:02] and that's the atmosphere that i want to
[1:30:04] live in
[1:30:06] i choose to live in and if i choose to
[1:30:09] live in
[1:30:09] i'm going to exercise my free moral
[1:30:11] agency and i'm going to speak the word
[1:30:14] that matches
[1:30:15] this word so that i can stay in that
[1:30:17] atmosphere
[1:30:19] amen let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:30:22] heavenly father we thank you for your
