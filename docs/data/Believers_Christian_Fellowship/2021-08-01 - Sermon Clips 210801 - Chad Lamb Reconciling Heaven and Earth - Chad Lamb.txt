========================================

now on easter morning there was another light struck the earth when the holy spirit was given and it's given to bring life to those seeds that god by his foreknowledge knew that would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural seed he knows where the spiritual seed is your body was laying here right then on the earth when god first brought the earth into existence my goodness if god laid the elements for your body knowing that down the road he would need these elements to make your body when something begins to happen to your body why don't we turn to the one who laid the elements here before the foundation of the world and say god i need help with this body you lay the elements out here like he says like a great contractor he lays it all out he knows he's going to be building in each stage that he's going to build until he gets to completion and he lays all his material out and the material for your flesh body was laid here when he first formed the world and if you're having problems with your flesh body with the material that was laid here turned to the one who laid it here and had a plan for it and still has a plan today and say god this is the situation but i know you laid these elements on this earth to form this body to manifest your glory in this day and i'm asking you to do your work in me today see the devil tries he's trying to make us afraid because when we're afraid amen we begin to get nervous and we turn our eyes from the promise and we begin to doubt we begin to question amen and that's not how god fulfills his word he fulfills his word by giving us a faith to believe his word because the word of god operates by faith so the devil is trying distractions and fear tactics and anxiety and i say turn back to the one who knew before the foundation of the world and said god you knew i would be here you knew i would have a need you provided a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world to meet this need and i'm trusting in you to meet the need and then forget about it
