amen that's what we desire his presence is with us amen not just in this place it's in this place because his presence remains with us amen let's all stand and let's go to the word all right let's go to saint john the gospel of john chapter one and we'll start there i'd like to i'd like to preach in the way of a christmas message and it's interesting brother branham every year preached a christmas message and he'll preach an easter message and a thanksgiving message but it's all the same thing he just preached the message amen whatever label it had or whatever time of year it was he still preached the message of the hour amen and we very much want to do the same thing so let's go to john chapter 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not let's jump over to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's turn from there over to luke chapter 2. luke chapter 2 and we'll begin reading from verse 1. luke chapter 2 and verse 1. and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone in his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth unto judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling claws and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end man let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for this opportunity to be together lord we thank you god as we open this book lord that it would be more than just the literacy of humanity being able to open a book and read it but god we pray you would open it to us lord open it to our understanding by revelation that we might have spiritual discernment of what your word is speaking to us for this hour that we live in now we answer you bless us lord that you would speak through these lips that you would have your way with us in jesus christ's name amen you can all be seated and then as we come into the christmas season it's a strange this has been a strange year and everything remains strange and and but i just pray that the lord will bless you and you have a good time with your families and take the time to just connect with your family and just consider it a blessing you know so many people this year strange we can't get together like we would some can some are not able i mean you have grandparents who are stuck in nursing homes who can't get a visit from anybody in their family so there's a lot of loneliness a lot of things that have changed but also in some ways it has taken christmas and made it a lot simpler taking away some of the running around and carrying on and brought it back to just a family at home and if we take advantage of that just our families at home and remember brother brennan said christmas should be the greatest day of worship of all the year and so don't forget if god has slowed us down and simplified things and made it the way we're not traveling or we're not gathering like we used to in years past let's still make it a day of worship amen and let's not waste the opportunity god gave us and let's not forget those who maybe are stuck in a nursing home and we'll get no visit no family no no nothing let's just remember them in prayer especially our brothers and sisters and and those that are related to them it's not an easy time but it's a good time the flesh may not like everything that's happening the flesh may not like all of the uh the changing environment changing situations the uncertainty in many things amen but but god is so good he's in control of everything because when we look here at luke chapter 2 the whole world went into a taxation there was a law and that law had brought about a a requirement especially as we see in in israel and judea there was a requirement that individuals would go back to their the city that they were born in or their city of their heritage at least to be counted and to be taxed and and no doubt that that was turmoil that created a lot of hardship and a lot of difficulty if you think just about mary and joseph mary was great with child and i would say it wasn't a convenient time for her to take a trip we know that while she was there for the taxation her days were accomplished and she delivered and we know traveling down she was great with child and we've talked about this before but if we put ourselves in the environment in that day amen they were they were under foreign rule they were under roman rule they they didn't have their liberty they didn't have their freedom as the jewish nation as they'd want to have and they were crying out for a deliverer and and deliverance but here they have a new law that requires everybody move about and travel back to a place of heritage for a taxation and i'm sure there was a lot of complaining can you imagine can you imagine if that happened now okay i i there was probably a lot of complaining a lot of disruption to people's lives disruption to plans disruption to who knows what was disrupted what kind of hardship that created but nonetheless they were subject to that and mary and joseph couldn't circumvent that because of where they were they were subject to those things and they began to travel amen in the very thing that was the difficulty the very thing that was troublesome or or difficult or inconvenient was moving them right according to prophecy because the government is not going to move outside of god's word of prophecy god's prophecy is going to orchestrate everything that's happening in the government i mean even if you think about if you think about the environment in europe amen in the late 30s that would create uh hitler's regime and and start world war ii and all the chaos and all the turmoil and all the laws and all the governments and the uprisings and the changes and everything that was happening in that time period and we look at that and we say oh that's a terrible thing a terrible time but the prophet of god would look at that time and he would call it the tender hand of jehovah moving israel back into the homeland so that they can receive their messiah and so the things that are happening in 2020 and the things that may happen on in 2021 amen nothing is going to move outside plans of prophecy his cogs are turning right on time amen and we need to we need to check ourselves some time and stop the complaining i wince when i say that because i'm talking to myself amen stop the complaining and understand that whatever is happening is happening for our benefit whatever is happening is happening for the word of god saying for the prophecy's sake and this thing's marching forward and there's nothing different this christmas than was the christmas jesus was born amen we know he wasn't born december 25th we know he's born in the spring because he's a lamb i'm just talking the world is celebrating the world is talking about it and brother branham says we're not going to ignore and act like it's not happening so so we know that he was born in the spring but that spring that he was born it's no different than this last spring it'll be no different than the next spring if there is a spring amen the same things that were happening there are happening again we're in the same environment we're in this in the same circumstances it's the same spirits it's the same cycle of prophecy that's moving forward in a revolving history and we find her that's how we can so easily find ourselves in the bible because this prophecy this word of prophecy is moving forward in a cycle of natural and spiritual types and it's moving forward in a revolving history and we find ourselves back in the same places that they found themselves in the word of god fighting the same spirits in many of the same circumstances so praise god it's not a it's not a book of history it's not a book that's only pointing to the future but it's a book that's explaining to us what's happening in our lives now so we know that they had to go back to bethlehem they had to go to the because it was the city of david and they were of the lineage of david and so they had to go to bethlehem and brother branham i'm referencing two main sermons uh today and referencing why little bethlehem and why it had to be shepherds and this would be a good season to go back and listen to as many of you probably already have but as the as the days move forward and we go into the weekend it would be good to listen to uh why little bethlehem and why it had to be shepherds and and because brother branham starts to break down some things and explain even what's going on in our day and we find out bethlehem means the house of god's bread the house of god's bread where else could jesus christ be born but in the house of god's bread and he was of the lineage of david joseph was and mary was also they were both of the lineage of david they were both come from david amen and he had to go back he had to go back because the prophecy said that out of bethlehem of judea would come a governor that would rule the people amen in bethlehem would be the least of the cities of judah amen because god is always working through humility he's not going to the greatest he's going to the least and he's coming from there but bethlehem has a rich history that has everything to do with you and i and brother brown explains this thoroughly and why it had and why little bethlehem but all the way back when israel was crossing into the promised land they would come to a city called jericho and in jericho there'd be a woman who would who would believe the word of god and in believing she would receive a token and that token would save her household and that would that woman would be known as the harlot rahab a canaanite gentile woman but but she would be married eventually after jericho collapsed and after they moved forward into the promised land she would be married to a prince of judah she'd be married to the prince of the house of judah and that prince would be salmone and she would become the wife of salmon and brother benham said rahab and salmon would go to bethlehem and they were the ones who established bethlehem so what was the establishing of bethlehem where did bethlehem come from bethlehem was established by a gentile woman married to a prince of judah so this is how important this city is god was looking after bethlehem all the way back amen when he would take the harlot rahab amen and he would and he would redeem her under a token and save her under a token her and her household she would be united with a prince of the house of judah which is typing christ taking a gentile bride and they too in their union would move forward and establish themselves in bethlehem so bethlehem was founded was founded by a christ type a prince of the house of judah marrying a gentile who was called a harlot can you see yourself in the bible this is where bethlehem comes from that's why david had to come out of bethlehem that's why the son of david has to be born in bethlehem that's why bethlehem has the name of the house of god's bread amen it has everything to do with the story of christ and his bride so now bethlehem come from rahab rahab was married to salman they established bethlehem and they had a son and that son's name was boaz and boaz becomes the type of the kinsmen redeemer a type of christ and when it's come time for boaz to marry who else would he marry in bethlehem but ruth the moabitess another gentile woman marries a christ type the kinsmen redeemer wear in bethlehem in the house of god's bread amen would be a union between a gentile woman and a christ type in bethlehem in the out of their union would come obed and from their union would produce a seed would reduce a sun that would be the redemption of naomi would be the redemption of israel so the union between the gentile and the christ type will produce a seed will produce a son that will be redemption for israel it's the same thing that's happening in our day through the union of a bride amen with christ will produce the son of man again that will be a redemption for the 144 thousand all of this is laying in bethlehem so you know i i so appreciate amen the way our children are able to be raised because when i grew up i didn't know anything about the bible story we would read luke chapter 2 but you read it until it's just words amen and the words have no meaning it's a historical thing and everybody knows i mean you start reading it as soon as you start luke chapter 2 and it came in in the past in those days that there went out a decree from caesar and and much of the world especially the christian world can begin to recite it from there or at least follow along closely enough to inject a few words but there's so much meaning here that has to do with the message of the hour and the message they are unlocked and it takes it away from a fable or a story or a historical happening amen and we begin to see why little bethlehem because the bride is there established bethlehem was established by a gentile woman and a prince of judah redemption amen the redemption for naomi which is a type of the old church or the type of israel redemption for naomi amen was laid down the type of it the shadow was laid down in the book of ruth the redemption for israel was shown in bethlehem praise be to god i so thank god for the word of the hour that our children know the truth in christmas they don't know anything about a santa claus amen they know it's not real they know it's a fable they know it's a story they know it's a makeup amen they know it it's something it's a distraction it's a diversion it's a celebration of the world amen but the truth of christmas has everything to do with you and i and where we're at here right now there's a christmas taking place today we don't want to talk about the christmas of 2000 years ago and look back at how wonderful that is that was amazing amen where are the presents but i'll tell you the present is here the gift of god is here christmas is here there's a christmas today tomorrow every day the 25th the 26th to 27th january february march april it's christmas where's christmas christmas is in me christmas is all around me i'm part of christmas amen let's read verse 7 again verse 6. we'll start at 6 and continue on and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling claws and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end huh imagine that you know joseph is journeying down he's got a wife that's great with child and that child is of the holy ghost the lord told him in a dream to take her and now you know all this taxation and all this trouble and all this traveling down and everybody's moving about and now there's no room in the end and we've got to go uh now to a stable because there's no room in the end we all know the story so well but if we could just place ourselves in that day he knows his wife is so close to delivering she's so uncomfortable maybe in a great deal of pain he's trying to find a place to go and god already has a provided place but god's provided place isn't the first place you want to go i don't believe it was the first place joseph wanted to go because the scripture says there was no room at the end how did they know there was no room in the end if they didn't check at the end so his first choice wasn't the stable we understand that this wasn't joseph's first choice but this had been god's choice be from before the foundation of the world and listen friends we we are in the christmas now amen it's in us it's all around us christ is being delivered amen through his bride and there's already a predestinated plan god already knows what's going to happen but sometimes he doesn't give us our first choice or second choice or third choice but he moves us to a place we wouldn't even go ourselves because it's perfect for the prophecy because what was coming forth was the lamb of god and the lamb of god couldn't be born in that end the lamb of god had to be born where lambs are born had to be born in the stable because god is orchestrating this whole thing so that we could look back and say that's why that's why that's why it was prophecy being fulfilled verse 8 and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone around about them and they were afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling claws laying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will towards men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away were gone from them unto heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even into bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the shepherds and mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and the message why it had to be shepherds brother branham begins to explain amen why would god call shepherds why would shepherds get an angelic visitation and why would the shepherds be the first ones on earth to know that christ the savior is born in the city of david because brother branham said shepherds always attend the birth of lambs who would be more fitting amen when the lamb of god was going to be born but to tell the shepherds and the shepherds were the ones who would always be the first people to know when a lamb was born and nothing's going to change on this day amen because the lamb of god is being born in a stable in the house of god's bread according to prophecy and there's some shepherds who are going to be the ones who are the first witnesses to testify that a lamb is born and gone and called shepherds he said because he didn't call the educated you didn't need any education to be a shepherd amen the brother baptist said they were more likely than not illiterate amen but but god would choose amen shepherds because shepherds had the right characteristics he was looking for amen to be the first people on earth to declare that the savior is here that the lamb is here amen because the way that god had to bring his lamb he had to bring him in humility amen he had to bring him in a stable he had to lay him in the manger he meant and these are things that the theologians couldn't understand these were things that the aristocrats could not comprehend they could not accept but these were not things that were foreign to shepherds shepherds were accustomed to the stable to the sights and sounds and smells brother brahma said some of them clergymen they'd have to run in there and put a clothespin on their nose but god would call shepherds because of their humility because of their familiarity with lambs because of their understanding of the humility by which christ had to be born god called the humble god called the lowly because the lowly and the humble would be able to understand and they would have no conflict no problem amen seeing what was seen and believing and accepting it just the way god sent it they wouldn't need it in a nicer package they wouldn't need it in a better way they were perfectly comfortable with the way god would send his word and i'm telling you there's still shepherds on earth today that are perfectly comfortable with the way god has chosen to send his word in this age they're not looking for a better a better location they're not looking for a better place amen they're fine with a stable they're fine with a manger they're fine with swaddling cloths taken off the yoke of an ox why because they're simple they're humble amen they have nothing to prove they have no reputation to save amen they just see they hear they see they believe they testify praise god brother branham says the scriptures say in here let's go back and look at verse 15. and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass look at the simplicity of the shepherds they didn't say let's go see if this is true they knew it was true and they were excited and say let's go see this thing that has come to pass they accepted it because an angelic messenger a messenger from heaven told them it was true and they accepted it they didn't need to go talk to the sanhedrin they didn't need to talk to the priest that was in charge of the synagogue of bethlehem they didn't need oh they all they needed was an angel messenger to tell them that christ was here that this is christ he's born in the city of david and they said let's go see this thing that has come to pass oh god make us shepherds amen make us like the shepherds to be able to realize in this day amen this thing has come to pass christ is here amen christ the savior is here then they went and they seen after they seen i mean this is why god chose shepherds they didn't need anybody else's word on it what the angel said was enough then they run down to bethlehem because their excitement to see and when they had seen the vindication of the word the next thing they they say is they run out and begin to tell everybody they didn't need a counsel they didn't need they didn't need approval they didn't need anything they believed they saw and they testified and the scripture says verse 17 and when they had seen it they made they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child they're saying this is christ this is the savior this is the fulfillment of prophecy and and listen what says next and all they that heard it wandered at those things which were told them by the shepherds it didn't say they believed they just wondered amen and we've had the same experience in our day we tell them the same story and when we tell them to in present tense there's been an angel messenger he said this and i seen and it's true that christ is here the word is here amen amen the lamb of god is here amen and the bridegroom has come and they wonder now what is that they're talking about what is that what a strange thing why these shepherds are running through bethlehem what is this they're talking about hey friends they're still wondering today there's people who are still wondering about the testimony of simple humble shepherds but that testimony was true and if they had believed that testimony then there would have been no confusion when the wise men showed up about two years later but they had no idea the message of the wise men when they come about two years later because they didn't receive the message of the shepherds and when he did receive the message of the shepherds now there was nobody there that could receive the message of the wise men praise be to god god knows what he's choosing now now bethlehem brother ben tells us was the bread center of that whole region said they grew barley there or wheat or whatever it was and you see them threshing barley and wheat boaz had great wheat and barley farms and there was a time of threshing when ruth come into the land and gleaning and all of that so we know brother ben points to that and says it was a great bread center for all of that area and he says it was a great water a place of water there was a tremendous well of water a spring of water in bethlehem it was a water center and there was a bread center for that area why did god choose bethlehem praise be to god let's turn to john chapter 6. i know to many of you these things are so familiar we go over them all the time but i want the kids to hear and i want the teenager to hear and i want those who've not caught at all i want them to catch it this time around john chapter 6 verse 35 this is the woman this is the woman at the well conversing with jesus in verse 35 it says and jesus said unto them no i'm sorry yeah just six this isn't the woman at the well sorry that'll come later hold that that's that's chapter 4 6 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst so you get that bread and water i want you to catch that bread and water he says uh let's read it again he said unto them i am the bread of life that cometh down that i'm sorry that cometh he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst let's go down to verse 48 he says i am the bread of life your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which come down from heaven if any man eateth this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world and his flesh was the word made flesh his flesh was the word his flesh was the manifestation of the word of god for that day and he said i give the bread that i give to you the bread that i give to you is the word made flesh is my flesh and now jesus is the bread so now what came was the lamb of god in bethlehem but bethlehem's the bread center of the world of the bread center of that region and to the bread center of that region comes the bread from heaven and where does he take him he has to be born he has to be born in a stable because he's a lamb but he's not just the lamb he's also bread he's also the weed he's also the seed he's also the the feed amen he's not just the lamb that'll take away the sins of the world he's also the bread of life amen that you have to feed on to live and so where does he take the bread of life he makes sure that the bread of life is not placed in a cradle or not placed in any place it's got to be placed in a manger because what's a manger a manger is a feed trough or a hay rack amen for cattle and for sheep and when the shepherds show up they understand what a manger is and why this little baby is laying in the manger because this was the lamb that was born in the stable but he was placed in the manger because he's sheep food because sheep eat from the manger this has become the not just the lamb that'll take away the sins of the world the sacrificial lamb but he's also the meat he's also the bread he's also the food that we feed on and live shepherds know who is the shepherds let's just say this way the shepherds know where they are in prophecy the shepherds heard the angel messenger the shepherd knows where christ is the shepherd know who christ is and the shepherds know where to take the sheep for sheep food there's still shepherds on earth today that know the same thing whatever happened in that christmas is happening today brother branham said in the message why it had to be shepherds he said why scholars would have been so out of place there he's talking about the stable under such circumstances they had left right quick why the messenger coming to common herdsmen maybe they could not even some of these herdsmen might not have been able to have signed their own name very doubtful you know the herdsmen that jesus chose when he was here on earth to hurt his sheep loveth thou me peter more than these yea lord thou knowest i love thee feed my sheep and the bible said that peter was an ignorant and unlearned man still choosing shepherds brother remember said when jesus was there what is he choosing when he was choosing his disciples he was choosing shepherds and he got the ignorant and unlearned because he said feed my sheep what will you feed the sheep there's nothing else to feed the sheep but the living word amen the bread that have come down the fresh manna from heaven is the only thing that you feed the sheep amen and true shepherds know what to feed the sheep now i want to take a look at zechariah 13. let's go to zechariah 13 because i want to look at this water as well he was the bread of life but brother brenham said that bethlehem was also the water sinner and we know that he's also the fountain of living water zechariah 13 1. the book of zechariah chapter 13 verse 1 and that day there should be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness and that day there should be a fountain opened to the house of david to the habits of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness listen to what the prophet of god says in the message why little bethlehem god smote a rock or had moses to do it his prophet smote the rock what was it open the rock what is rock a rock is revelation amen a rock is a revelation of the word of god amen and moses the prophet smote the rock and brother man says what did he do he opened the revelation and out of the revelation come living water and and he goes on to say the rock the rock was christ and christ is the word the rock was christ do you believe it all right then if the prophet opened the rock so life could come out then if it is the rock today we need the holy spirit and some man who will smite back the rock amen and let the word come out because he is the word what's brother ben saying he's saying we need some man we need the holy ghost we need the holy ghost in some man who will smite back the rock amen if it took a moses amen the first time it'll take one like unto moses and who was that one like unto moses it was the prophet of this day brother branham and we need and he says we need the holy spirit and some man who else is that man that could smite back to that rock amen so that life can come out amen and he says listen and some men who will smite back the rock amen and let the word come out because the word is the water of life the word amen is the water of life springing up into everlasting life he said the word come out because that word carries life he said my word they are spirit and they are life he said now strike back the rock amen and let the word come out because he is the word we've bypassed on creeds and drinking stagnant water from cisterns what we need today is an opening of the word that lives this is what the prophet is talking about what we need is an opening of the word that lives friends have we seen an opening of the word that lives is there an opening of the word that lives in us amen is there water that's flowing out from the smitten rock yes amen there's still water coming from bethlehem there's still a fountain open to the house of david amen now i want you to catch this as he moves on what we need today is an opening of the word that lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail they they can call it mental telepathy they can say whatever they want to or spiritualism or a devil as long as the word is flowing free and producing exactly what it said it would do it's a fountain in the house of david again what's he saying whatever that fountain was it's a fountain again as long as what as long as that word is flowing freely and doing exactly what it said it would do it's a fountain amen in the in the house of david again back in bethlehem where that jesus christ the same yesterday today forever to his bethlehem dwellers live with it live in it it's life journeying water for us as israel had what is it amen it's a fountain open in the house of david again when's it become open again it's become open again at the end time amen when you can go back to bethlehem back to the house of god's bread amen when we can go back to the word made flesh on earth praise be to god in the message broken cisterns prophet said it was standing here in the fountain filled with blood that day standing there in the temple the time of storm in zechariah the 13th chapter he was that fountain opened in the house of david for cleansing and for sin cleansing of sin he was that fountain and in psalm 36 9 he was david's fountain of life he is still that fountain in the house of david and he is the poets in his heart there the poet said there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the flood lose all their guilty stains he is that fountain of life fountain of water he is the word of god people of these last days has forsook them the true word water of life and that hewed themselves out denominational cisterns again a huge dug and now we find out that they have had broken cisterns and then the cistern is filled with unbelieving germs unbelieving boasting educational programs and so forth which is contrary to god's promise they are doubters of the word now these systems that they've got the bible said we're broken broken cistern is a leaking cistern and it's seeping out what's it doing it's seeping out into religious cesspools called the world council of churches and that's where the the broken cistern is leading them to all because they have forsook him the fountain of living water and made these cisterns it was the same thing in the time that jesus was born amen they dug themselves out cisterns of pharisee camp of pharisee campus sadducee herodians and and all these others amen he came as a fountain of living water amen and where did he come from bethlehem the house of god's bread there's a spring of living water flowing up there's bread for the sheep to eat there's a lamb of god that was born where out of bethlehem the house of god's bread and he is the fountain opened in the house of david and brother branham says what we need is somebody that can smite that bring it back to the word to the opening of the word and whenever the words open and flowing out and doing what it said it would do producing what he said it would produce it's a fountain open in the house of david what is it it's the water is flowing where's it flowing it's flowing from jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever what is he the word made manifest in your day is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he is the same he does the same he will forever be the same he is the word made manifest in our day and wherever that's flowing out doing exactly what it said it would do there is where it's a fountain open in the house of david again there's a there's a fountain in bethlehem flowing flowing from where from the house of god's bread there's bread to eat in the bread center there's water to drink amen there's a sacrificial lamb he says again and why little bethlehem that's exactly where god waters his sheep again today right back at bethlehem it's cool fresh water listen why bethlehem remember i want to remind you how bethlehem was founded a gentile woman rahab salman the prince of israel type of christ coming together and in their union they established a bethlehem out of bethlehem will come boaz and boaz and ruth amen from that will come obed jesse david for the prophecy to be in the son of david the son of david will be born back in bethlehem again why it's back to this original picture of christ and his bride coming together and out of that union there's established a house of god's bread and out of that house of god's bread will come the lamb of god the word of god the water of life the bread from heaven that's why it's back to bethlehem again friends that's why it's back to the original intent the original idea the original mystery that's been laying in the bible the mystery that was there when rahab married solomon the mystery when they went up to bethlehem and established it the mystery of boaz and ruth the mystery of david it's all laying right there in the bible and the mystery is coming to manifestation in this day and where it's manifested in this day the living word made flesh that prophecy that was typed through the bible is now standing on earth in flesh the bridegroom is united with his bride and that is a fountain in the house of david that's open again that is bread from this bread center of the world bethlehem christmas is here christmas is in you you become the house of god's bread amen it's not something we look back to it's something that's taking place right now amen that was only showing amen what he's doing to bring about this to bring us back to bethlehem with the original foundational intent of bethlehem because out of bethlehem will come the king that will rule out of bethlehem will come the water will come the bread will come the king the son of david praise god the bible's so beautiful friends and only a prophet of god could go back and pick these pieces up and show you salmon and rahab you know the world looks at the story of rahab and they cannot figure it out they cannot understand rahab the heart they say well you know it's the mercy of god and look how merciful god is they'll even take a harlot and they don't even understand the picture that's being painted amen they don't understand and the moabite is marrying boaz amen they don't understand how how judah could take tamar and deception and bring about the godly seed but we understand because it's our story because we've lived this story and we're living this story amen we understand bethlehem bethlehem was it's not just a little story it's not god didn't say you know where where when when i bring the lamb where would i bring him where will i bring david because david will be my my my chosen king and from my chosen king who will be a son a prophecy of a son of david that will rule forever where will i bring him from i like the ring of bethlehem he knew he knew when ruth was when rahab was born where bethlehem was going to be he knew when solomon crossed the dry jordan where bethlehem could be because it was all playing into the picture he wanted to paint and at the end time we had a prophet of god that could point us all the way back and say that's what was going on when salmon fell in love with rahab the harlot that's what was happening when they moved up to establish bethlehem that's what was happening amen when david was on the hillside longing for water from the well of bethlehem what is it all about it's all about you and i today the mystery of god made manifest i'll keep reading and why little bethlehem and that's exactly where god waters his sheep again his sheep again today where's god watering his sheep again today right back at bethlehem it's cool fresh water right back at bethlehem what was the point of bethlehem what was the point of rehab salmon ruth and boaz david and joseph and mary both from the house of david their lineages both go back to david going back to be taxed going into a stable laying him in a manger what what what is all of that it's all pointing to the word made flesh what's the goal always been to have the word made flesh god prophesied all the way back in genesis in the beginning when he made man and pulled out a woman united them he always showed us that out of christ will come a woman and it'll be the word made flesh and that's the day that we live in right back to bethlehem it's cool fresh water he cried out if only i had a drink from that well again who is it david crying out longing for the water from bethlehem he said i'm going to close now listen close if only i had a drink this is brother brandon preaching his christmas message if only i had a drink inside of him cried out if i could only drink once more from that well at bethlehem his desires was a was a commandment to those who loved him remember his soul was crying for a drink of that water and those who loved him his least desire was a commandment we're told that three of those men got together great men one killed 800 by himself the other one jumped into a pit and killed a lion one took a stick and knocked the spirit of an egyptian's hand and slew him with his own spear and stood on a field of lentil that like that and killed 300 around him great men listen to the next statement they were gentiles great men these great warriors they were gentiles i wonder why they were gentiles i wonder why the greatest of the three the three greatest in the camp of david david was an outcast king he was an anointed king and he was pushed outside the city amen and there was those that gathered outside the camp and they came to the great anointed king who were they who were the greatest three of them they were gentiles amen gentiles because the great king when he's pushed out of the city there's going to be gentile warriors that gather to this king [Music] they were gentiles watch where they came from david here is a type of christ bethlehem because christ is david's son here he stands there crying for a drink of that water and his desire was a command i said to those who love a command i said to those who loved him three of those men pulled their swords fought 15 miles of men down to the city while others fought keeping them were gallant fighting men those philistines twice their size some of them but they were men gallant who could fight one of them stood alone alone handed and killed 800 men right around them in one day they were great men they trusted god they had faith in their leader and they cut his way down through until while some of them cut and the other one got a bucket of water and they cut their way back through another 15 miles of men and brought that up to david so he could drink it david was the outcast king and to him were gathered mighty gentile warriors the greatest of his warriors were gentiles because in this day when we go back to bethlehem to get the water of life there'll be gentiles that are fighting their way through denominational demons that are trying to keep the people from the water this water this original word amen the original word that was originally brought to us amen that paul had brought in the new testament that was corrupted it's garrisoned about by philistines but praise god there are warriors who have gathered to the son of david amen to the outcast king and they're willing to fight their way just because the king wants a drink of that original water from bethlehem with the original purpose with the original intent and they're willing to fight their way through to get that drink of water for him he goes on to say oh you bethlehem dwellers i call for men warriors who's not afraid i don't care if there's 800 standing on one side and 10 000 on the other i want warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving philistines the world council that has got garrisoned around the word of god trying to make it creeds and feed the people what's he saying he said what is it that surrounded bethlehem to keep the people from the water and the bread of life amen what are they trying to keep the people from they're trying to keep the people from the word but there's warriors who will fight their way through the word there's a he said there's a well there's a fountain open in the house of david bethlehem for sin and then clean his brother sin is unbelief in his word there's a fountain open to the house of david for cleansing from sin what is sin unbelief what will cleanse us from unbelief the original unadulterated pure word of god will come and wash us from from the harlotry of the systems from unbelief in the word amen from corruption of creeds and they've garrisoned off bethlehem to keep the people from the water and from the bread and they've come up with creeds to feed the people but there are gentile warriors on this earth who will do the same thing they did back there that was only a foreshadow of our day and there's gentile words today that will cut their way through creeds dogmas philistine demons to get back to the water in bethlehem and get back to the bread center and they may look like shepherds praise be to god in a thinking man's filter brother brother said it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the bible said so jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins what do you need you need that water from bethlehem why because he's calling for a perfect bride to be in a perfect condition to be married to a perfect bridegroom how can you do it there's only one way you need that perfect water that's the water of separation that'll wash you from uncleanness to wash you from creeds and dogmas wash you from ideas of man wash you from all the unbelief that's the only way you can stand perfect and unadulterated virgin bride of jesus christ is if we let this water from bethlehem wash us but it will take the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride and yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it so what's it going to take it's going to take that water from the well of bethlehem and when those three men cut their way down there and they scooped up that water bucket and they run it back to david david took that water which is the water of life amen representing the blood of jesus christ and he took that water and he poured it out on the ground in a prophecy showing that one day the son of david will spill his blood out upon the water and out of that blood will come the water of life to bring the people back to the water of life from bethlehem amen david took that water and how could i drink this when these men sacrificed and he poured it out and brother branham said he was just showing that christ would spill out his blood as an offering to god and that life that was spilled would become the water of life for you and i again in thinking's man's filter he says also now we want to look at ephesians 5 26 that it's the washing of the water by the word a waters of separation what does it do then the filter of god is the word waters of separation washes washing of the waters of separation by the word god's filter then you can't come into christ through a church filter you can't come by denominational filter or creed filter there's only one filter that you can enter into the holy place and that's through the washing of the water by the word the word of god is a thinking man's filtering and the word of god is the waters of separation that washes us and separates us from our sin of unbelief where is that water i want to tell you there's a fountain open in the house of david because when the word amen is flowing freely and doing what he said he would do the manifestation of the word for the hour amen doing exactly what he said he would do is a fountain opened in the house of god there's water flowing from bethlehem friends we can cut our way through and get to that water let's go back to zechariah if while you're turning zechariah go back to zechariah chapter 12. i want to read this quote out of the invisible union what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word became blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleansed and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word that fountain is open friends that water is flowing out of bethlehem amen and and we can cut our way to that water zechariah chapter 12. i want to back up just before we had read 13 1 13 1 says in that day and i just want to know in what day in that day there shall be a fountain open in the house of david to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness and i want to just back up and just take the scriptures before and start a chapter or chapter 12 verse 10. and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great morning in jerusalem as the morning of had had a dreamland in the valley of mcgeeden and the land shall mourn every family apart in the family of the house of david apart and their wives and the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart and the family of the house of levi apart and their wives apart the family of shemia apart and their wives apart and all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart and in that day there shall be a fountain open in the house of david we know that this is speaking about a time when two witnesses are going to be prophesying and showing messiah the word amen the word made flesh jesus christ to the 144 thousand and this this is bringing them to the feast of atonement where they recognize amen that they have slain the lamb of god and they separate every man to them house and mourn but brother branham takes the same thing and types it right back to the church because where did he get his wounds in the house of his so-called friends and we look back in this day because we've come to the true atonement to the word to recognize it's the word that bled for us it's the word that died for us that the true atonement is the word and the word has been crucified by creeds and dogmas in churchianity and church systems and we stand today and we separate from those things and we look back and say oh they've been crucifying the word they've been piercing the word it's been the word and in this day amen we've mourned over the fact that it's been denominational systems and denominational teaching in our own denominational ideas that has been crucifying the lamb of god we mourn and then we come to rejoicing because we recognize he returned so it's in that day the day that they recognize their messiah i just want you to hold on to that it's the day that they recognize their messiah and we know that there's a future fulfillment of that under the two prophets moses and elijah but in the feast of trumpets brother branham said think of it it's the end time folks hallelujah the great day of the lord is at hand gather yourselves together to the feast of the messiah they'll reject him and they'll find out that there is their messiah the bible said them striking things like this would take place in revelation 11 call their ministry will be the ministry of moses and elias calling to israel out of the jewish traditions just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of pentecostal traditions so brother madam is typing the same scene that's going to take place in the future he's typing it with his own ministry just as the seventh angels message called the bride out of the pentecostal traditions remember moses and elijah is to call israel out of the old atonement of the lamb and sheep and blood and goats and sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the word so they're going to show them that you you you you crucified the lord of glory amen he's going to they're going to show them the word because they're going to receive the same message that we're receiving amen and it brings them to the feast of atonement where they mourn for what they lost but they come to the word for their atonement the true brother brother of them says the real living sacrifice to the word and the seventh angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the pentecostal world tradition to the genuine atonement the word christ impersonated in his word here made flesh among us what they what happened to them has happened to the church amen has happened to the bride she's been called out of the old pentecostal tradition and she's been brought into the true atonement the living sacrifice to the word and it's in that day it's in that day that there's a fountain open in the house of david brother brahms said in the message why little bethlehem you say well i belong to the biggest organization that takes you that much further from god you say i do this that that just takes you that much further you've got to humble yourself until you see that until if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will what we try to do as soon as god gives us a little shower blessings we try to twist it all up and get dignitaries in there that's going to make great big names and outdo the other ones this one starts this way and that one god leaves the whole thing what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the holy spirit upon the hearts that's humble let's go to john chapter 4. i want to read two scriptures as we close john chapter 4. this is the story of the woman at the well that i misquoted earlier verse 10 john chapter 4 verse 10 jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldn't have asked of him and he would have given thee living water see jesus was that fountain from bethlehem jesus was the fountain of living waters from bethlehem and the woman saith unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with and the well is deep from winston hast thou the living water art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life he was the he was the fountain of the house of david he was the the water from bethlehem but he said if you come to this well and drink you'll have water coming out of you let's go to john chapter 7. john chapter 7 verse 37 in the last day the great day of the feast that's the last day the eighth day of the seventh feast the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water he said he is the well he is the bread amen the water is still flowing friends it's still there and and for some it may still be behind the army of philistines but it's still there that foul has been opened in this day because the word has been made manifest the word is flowing freely amen we've come back to bethlehem we've come back to the original we've come back to the word made flesh amen we've come back to the original intent of christ and his bride coming together and there's a fountain open there's a well open and we can drink from that well but if we drink from that well be we become the well amen we become the shepherds amen we become just like peter when he says ignorant and unlearned but peter would you feed my sheep amen and and he's sending out shepherds and he's still sending out shepherds friends he's still sending out those that'll go to bethlehem and see amen that christ is here amen that the word is made flesh and will believe what the angel said and will run around and say hey guess what an angel said and look it's the truth and we'll stand in revelation 22 we need shepherds that'll stand in revelation 22 17 and say if anybody's thirst let him come and drink why because there's water here the lamb is here the bread is here the water is here eat and live drink and live amen feast on the lamb why because it's christmas all over again he's been born brother branham back in this message why little bethlehem right where i stopped he said we need a fresh pouring out of the holy spirit upon hearts that that's humble we need a real christmas a birthplace listen when brother man's talking about christmas he's bringing it right to his day we need a real christmas a birthplace what is a christmas what was that what was that christmas it was a birthplace for the word made flesh to be born and it was born in the house of god's bread in the city of david we need a real christmas a birthplace he says if you could realize that you're nothing but a stable that's not hard can you realize you're nothing but a stable you realize you're nothing but a stable god didn't go to jerusalem to shiloh or raymond gilead he came to a stable that was polluted when you let god you become and you realize in yourself that you're nothing but a stinking stable but welcome open your doors when these great big places and ends are turning him away open your doors of the manger of your heart and let jehovah come in to that and watch what takes place for he is the word he said if you abide in me my word in you he is the word let him come into you and watch what takes place we can just realize that you're a stinking stable but just open yourself to him amen and and let the word made flesh be birthed amen in you amen that stable that day so long ago it became a temple why because the lamb of god was there because god was was abiding there amen and that he moved into a little house and when the magi showed up the wise men nearly two years later he was living in a house and they went into the house and they began to worship in the house because christ was there but christ is here and he can be in you and you can worship him you can drink from the well of bethlehem you can feast on the bread from the bread center you can see the lamb and then be humble enough to be a shepherd and say i believe the report of the angel and i believe enough just to say what he said and to say what i see and to say what's the truth could you imagine you know them taking the shepherds and begin to question them in the synagogue in bethlehem now what about this word and what about this prophecy and what about this and what about that and the shepherds amen probably illiterate probably couldn't sign their name they couldn't answer their questions they couldn't defend their doctrine oh they didn't have to defend their doctrine it came from heaven amen they saw the vindication with their own eyes they knew it was true they went about just saying what they had heard and what they had seen amen they didn't need to prove it to the sanhedrin they didn't need to prove it to the temple guards or the or the synagogues or the high priest or whatever elders there were all they were commissioned to do was to believe what the angel had sent and they were simple enough to do it listen let's be shepherds let your heart be a manger let your old stinking stable open its doors and welcome him when he's turned out from all the end hey if this is if this is where you want to come then come we welcome you if you drink of the water you become a fountain because the word is living this day friends it's not dead christ isn't dead he's alive the word is made flesh again and there's water there's bread there's life in bethlehem let this be our christmas but brother graham said what we need is a real christmas not an inflatable santa claus in somebody's yard not a little manger scene what we need is a manger scene tonight we need a manger scene in the bethlehem dwellers we need a manger scene with humble shepherds that can humble themselves and just believe what the angel said we need a real christmas the world's caught up in fantasy the world is caught up in storytelling but there's a real christmas that's going on now there's a real bethlehem with a real fountain and real bread and i say come to the water of life and drink freely come come into bethlehem come drink from the well come eat of the bread and then you become the stable you become the fountain you become the manger praise god how many is glad they had a real christmas we've had a real christmas amen and i tell you children this is a christmas story everybody loves the christmas story amen but if you're if you're here and you're a little tyke and you're a little boy or little girl listen you can become the christmas story all you got to do is open up your heart and say lord be born in me lord you can if you want a manger in a stinky stable if this is where you want to come i open up myself and say lord you can be born here you can have my life you can use me you can take over this place be born here and live here and out of here flo listen children you can have a real christmas it's not about a present it's not about a pretty rapping amen god sent the present amen and now you're here with that same gift that can dwell in you what we need is a real christmas we need we need bethlehem dwellers who want a real christmas shepherds who will proclaim that there's a real christmas i'm so thankful for the word of god i'm so glad that we don't preach fairy tales and cutesy stories and that bring no life so glad that we don't get up to give a christmas message and make it feel good and family and light candles and and dance around the earth and that doesn't bring life but to have a birth inside the heart of his children that brings life that's a real christmas when christ is born and you and i when christ is here when the fountain is open when water is flowing and there's a people on earth that's crying come let him that's thirsty come whosoever will let him come and drink because the fountain is open to the house of david that's a real christmas i'm glad we've been freed from denominational nonsense and brought into a real christmas with real power and real life that can change somebody else's life those nativity scenes that are all over people drive by they glow in the dark they got this they have live animals those things are not changing anybody's life they're cute and they're nice and i like looking at the live nativities are my favorite it's not wrong but it's not bringing life it means the christmas story today that's bringing life it's the fount of water flowing today that's bringing life it's the bread of earth that's on the bread of life that's on earth today that's bringing life it's the message of the hour christ born in the heart of his bride amen here living in the bethlehem with bethlehem dwellers living in bethlehem that will bring life friends amen the church world thinks they're doing something they're doing nothing they're doing nothing but garrison the well from people i don't say that to be mean but it's the truth and somebody's got to stand on the earth and tell the truth you know for too long we're just like you guys are finding your way i'm fine my way it's not fine it's not fine to lie to the people it's not fine to hold him in tradition it's not fine to leave christmas back 2000 years it's not fine friends it's not okay it's not all right it's not fine with god because god wants to be on earth today he wants to be made flesh today he wants to be worshipped today he wants a fountain flowing freely today he wants bread that the sheep can eat today and he wants shepherds on earth that will just say when an angel told them from heaven what they saw to be true they have enough audacity to go out in the face of wisdom in the face of theology in the face of religion and just say what the angel said and we'll just point back to a stable and say if you want it there it is amen shepherds who are also warriors gentile warriors who cut through the creeds and cut through the dogmas and cut through all the trash to get to the water that's what we need this christmas not a cutesy story not a fairy tale not a pretty scene outside the front lawn of a church what we need is christmas in you christmas and me christ born here alive on this earth in flesh that's what we need and that's the christmas story we need to be telling friends that's the story we need to tell our children that's the story we need to tell our grandchildren that's the story we need to tell the world it's not mean that's not contrary that's the truth and the truth is the only thing that will set the people free i thank god for the truth that set me free and i have enough love for humanity to tell them the truth that will set them free amen god bless you let's all stand if musicians could come and brother ben if you could come i want to sing that song let the word be born in the manger of my heart if you're here or listening you're young or old or anything in between if you want to be the place where the word is born just open your heart say lord they shut you out of the end shut you

to me every time that it's going on in me it's going on in you friends amen let's sing that brother [Music] it was a tiny simple stable all beaten and more hardly the place [Music] to reveal his majesty so i know if i give him control [Music] of my heart let it live in me let it [Music] live inside this house [Music] [Music] partly the place let him have his way from glory unto glory he'll
