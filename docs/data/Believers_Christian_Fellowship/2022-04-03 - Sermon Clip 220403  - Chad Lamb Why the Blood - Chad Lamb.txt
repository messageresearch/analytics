TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you believe the word then the token has got to come for he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there you are believe him now you can't go get baptized in jesus name and not believe it i mean you can't just go through the motions but first you have to believe you have to repent what are you repenting from i'm born wrong everything about me is wrong you can say i grew up in the message i never smoked never drank never i mean i didn't even use a curse word i just used some bad slang one time you can still repent because you were born wrong amen if you come from a mother and a father you were born wrong and must repent and recognize that i'm wrong i'm hopelessly wrong i will never be right whether i was born in the raised in the message or not whether i never say i swear word in my whole life and go to church every sunday i am still wrong i need to repent i need something else i need another life the life in me is wrong it's corrupted it's perverted it's wrong it's wrong it's wrong it'll be wrong everybody needs a new birth no matter where you're born or what church you attend and what home you were growing up in because it's wrong amen but god created a sacrifice amen god himself became a living being a human being with human life amen so that he could that he could die amen and that blood could be shed and the life that was in that blood could come back into you after you repent believe god believe the full word of god amen repent and are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and if you go through those steps you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's an absolute guaranteed promise of god and that holy ghost amen is the token is the evidence that you've met his requirements what are his requirements repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that's it what are the rest what's the rest of the list brother john that's it but i thought we had the the brother brother told us how a christian should dress and we shouldn't go to these certain places and how a mansion treats his wife and listen get the holy ghost and it'll take care of the rest of that amen that's not you can't get the car before the horse meet his requirements and repentance recognize you're wrong you're completely wrong you're all wrong and there's no way for you to be right but god made a way himself amen and if we accept that by faith and believe that it was for us recognizing our failure and repent and give our life to him and believe the whole world and are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he has given a promise god will not go back on that promise you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost when you receive the gift of the holy ghost then everything brother bam says in the message makes sense
