TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then jesus came like a stranger in the night praise the lord i saw the light i saw the light i saw the light no more in darkness no more [Applause] just like the blind man praise the lord [Applause] inside [Music] i saw the light and i saw the light no more and darkness no more at night now i'm so happy no sorrow inside praise the lord i saw how about we sing it like this i am the light i am the light no more in so darkness no sorrow inside praise the lord i am the light i am praise the lord i the am i am the light of singing praise the lord lord thy help me [Music] [Music] is [Music] let's just raise our hands this morning have i don't wait [Music] lord i am and make me [Music] after [Applause] amen as brother john comes this morning let's just sing this song [Music] is [Music] his glory and praise oh let's sing it again [Music] turn your eyes upon jesus [Music] and the things [Music] of his glory your eyes upon [Music] is [Music] of his glory amen amen let's just bow our head word of prayer heavenly father we thank you that we can approach you this morning speak about your father you could let the moon preach the stars the trees but you decided you will use a man father i feel very little and no matter how i can prepare father i never felt feel good enough so just come down in your power of resurrection and speak to your children father when you do it is better so i ask you to guide us to be with us rather to uh feed us yourself from the manner the manner from above granted father i commit myself to you in jesus christ's name amen as we are standing up let's go to bible thank you musicians um brother franco if i can have the powerpoint colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god when christ who is our life shall appear then shall he also appear with him in glory may god at his blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated i want to talk this morning about seeking and manifesting god's attribute seeking and manifesting god attributes um maybe let me read something that brother branham says in [Music] a message the the questions and answers in 1962 but when you raise above that to heavenly things then set your affections on things above because you are reason with christ and now sit sit it together in heavenly places just rest assured not a thing can harm you not a thing even death itself has no can do a thing to you you already anchored in christ the assurance that the earnest the down payment's already been brought you've been you've accepted it uh what did you do raise up with him in resurrection that's where i'm gonna focus a lot of things come to my mind let's just god um pick what you want for his children this morning yeah it looks like a we have a dual life we are you are a dual being because uh when you look at it the scripture shows that everything that christ did you did it too when you die you die when you went to the grave you went to the grave you rise up you did rise up and uh then he say that these cities on the right hand of god the power of god you sitting with him he says so he say well if that's the case then set your affection from the things above because you are above and that brings us to recognize that we are a dual being one portion of us is on the earth that what you see the other portion is up there i am up there that makes me a mystical being one day i am one day i'm gone when he gives me the body change i'm gone who am i you've never seen me i never seen you duo being and when you are you being so and that's the that's why the scripture now say that being duo you will have to lean on one world or the other and he say well that one is the most important because over there you have your theophany that is looking straight at god is in the presence of god here this life is important we have things that we love we find dear but it's not really about the this earth it's more about the cosmos the system of this world so turn your affection to the system of above the kingdom of god that is above and the kingdom of god is made of the world and the strength of the earth are the cosmos the world system you live in it you have your filial love here then then i will say to you that set your affection uh above means uh lean more towards the kingdom above and this at the kingdom here will be neglected a little bit amen so how are we going to do that because it's attainable not because it's our effort to learn to all the other kingdom the kingdom of god it's not through our efforts it's attainable not by effort but because god has made provision is not a merit we heard it for the last two weeks two months is wonderful it's not on the merit basis it is already there potentially like a mother ego is calling his children or is the child that was uh forgotten the egg that was forgotten in the barnyard you know the story she's screaming to her say you are from above come up higher and the child said how can i do it but you say you have everything you need to do it you have two wings just to use them the potential is already there just use it that's what preachers do preachers preach that they are just like transmitters brother badam says we just trust me just to tell you what the mother ego is saying all right so we don't have our own message but we just say uh we transmit like for the engineers here it will be like a signal boosters that's what preachers are all right we just make the signal to get far enough but the signal is not generated by us and we just tell people what they already have you know you can do it you can use it not by effort because it's there we're just reminding you that you have it already you have two wings yes you can live a little bit on earth but your life is up there and you have a a big a strong beak you can eat meat actually you playing with these chickens in the back barnyard in a few days they will be your dinner and and the little ego say yeah that's funny you say that the other day i was dreaming eating a chicken i thought something is wrong with me that i'm some sort of a cannibal but church is true that if you look in your life you see something you see something that was there even though you were living all kind of things but there was just something that was crying out so then when the mother say yes you have a big you have wings she he just say yes yeah you just respond to the world because you are you are of the nature of the word yes and not by an effort not by merit even when we preach and we give the impression of we give the perception that his salvation is a merit it's it's awful oh god help me never never i'll pay attention but it's not about me pay attention paying attention is the holy ghost help me is not god has put everything already in us the fin in the back of a fish was there because god knew there would be water do you believe that yes we don't have to manufacture when you say come up higher we go higher we just respond to the mother ego lean toward one kingdom because if you set affection toward one you will neglect the other jacob did it right when jacob affection was set to rachel guess what happened to leah and that's what we're talking about now we need to eat more of the word of god the more we eat then there is no room for other things then when the weather comes and say room for dessert we say oh too late so because i already ate the most nutritive how can you say that food so i don't have a room for the uh delicious evil dessert it's just me who sometimes loves just to eat those desserts that cream sugar so good i can just spend one day thinking maybe spend one day not eating the real food just those delicious kind of evil the way to ask do you have a room not too late i'm full if we keep eating the word and the word and the word then there is no there is less room for this other kingdom so you see it's not our effort it's just if we love him we love him we eat his word we consume absorb it keep going keep going the rest the world this other world will start deeming that's right that's what he's saying remember the devil will never let you do that it's a it's a battle it's going to bring all kind of things all kind of work destruction and things but he's doing what he's supposed to do it is a formidable adversary yeah and we have to do what the lord asked us to do i want to talk uh i want to focus today on on an attribute of god because if we we turn our love our affection we set them on things of above which is the word we will start displaying the things of the above amen we will start to displaying god's attributes they will just come because the word god is the word so if you are with god you display his attributes i don't know how well to say this okay and many times when we think about god attributes we think about attribute of love and attribute of salvation and and all this is really good i want to talk about the attribute of a judge we don't talk about that um because you know i can just see you all quiet yeah that's exactly right because who does talk about judge or god being a judge or supreme judge it's kind of scary because when we look ourself we don't measure up okay so why do i have to talk about the judge i want to talk about salve the savior the redeemer the healer the sacrifice don't talk to me about the judge because when i when you talk about the judge i see myself already condemned so it's normal we get a little quiet and a little wary where is he going we we want to talk about god's mercy and his love and we truly want to do that but the attribute of the judge if you dig a little bit at least the way i received it um it's good because when we we fear the judge because we have also loved ones that are not safe is that right so when you talk about judgment or the judge you feel like oh i have loved one that are not saved and don't bring up that subject i've been praying all every day for for them and you know i was actually listening to brother brennan um not long ago maybe i was coming to church and he talked about the loved one being saved he said in a message in 62 a testimony on the the sea he said now if you want to save your husband or your wife just keep praying for them just keep praying that's all you have to do just keep praying and believing if there's any spark of life there at all god will put something across the path that they will see it i was when i get i read this or listen to this i was like god will stop the course of the life the way the life has been going god will stop it and then god will do something tremendous maybe the thing that made them go away from the message god will correct it and show them clearly and at that point they will have to make a decision so your prayers will make that happen so keep praying keep praying and one day god will actually stop the course of the life and answer the question and then at that point they will make a decision and and pray that they don't reject it because this is what i'm saying then if they reject it that's up to them you see maybe god will take that burden from you after they have been placed in front of the true clearly you say brother how is it possible the burden will never go away but god is always right do your part and god will bring the word to them so but judgment is not always maybe not what we always hear when we talk about attribute of a judge don't you know that you want to bring your enemy to the judge is that right okay and you want the judge to uh give you a victory right right so that aspect of the judge don't you love it i want to bring my enemy to him and that's what david i think when you read it it's like i am i'm a righteous give me victory upon my enemy now we know that we have two type of enemy one enemy satan lucifer is actually the smallest enemy because brother bynum says you can defeat him in anywhere any place anytime using the word of god so he's not the biggest enemy formidable adversary adversary but is not the biggest but the enemy that i want to bring to the judge is this person are you with me i want to bring that this uh this person who's standing god way i want to bring him to the judge and say god give me victory upon this enemy amen so remember taro is uh seeking to uh attribute of god and manifesting them god one of the god attributes is the judge first corinthians chapter 6 says do we do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you i are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters not knowing not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life so the thing is if we are risen of christ hidden in our life hidden with him what he is we are if he's a judge we are judges so we will not wait until the end then he start handing out certificate you are a judge now so one day as our pastor used to say one day we will become judges or do we want it now the attribute of judge have to manifest now not one day i will be this do we agree or not [Music] so because we will judge even angels so how can we do that again there is nothing that i will bring to you that is new is continue getting the word of god in the word of god are the attributes of god let me just go uh this way a good judge discerned you know in israel kings were also judges do we agree if you're a king you judge your people so to be a good judge you have to discern the case and say there's something wrong here and that's what the solomon asked god and say god give me that uh give me wisdom so i can judge your people and brother abraham turns around and say that gift that solomon had was to discern what gives us a discernment is the word of god because it's like a a sharp two aged sword if we have the word of god then we will have a discernment then we will discern things that are happening in our own life things that happen in our homes you know we can discern that oh i can see through this movies that are start coming in my house i'm opening the door to satan your discernment from the word of god tells you don't do that you are opening the door actually you you are on the door as a father to protect the whole family but suddenly you lack uh discernment and you let think inside the house amen a good judge will discern that this spirit is uh the spirit of the devil is attacking this family so those when i think about these things other things come to me this you can see brother branham is his daughter two years old she's crying screaming all the time they cannot sleep and all that then i don't think that i don't remember that it was a discernment by by a gift or something but it's just a discern that the devil is attacking his ministry two years old child crying is actually the devil attacking his ministry that's what we need we need that discernment and it is an attribute of god and we get it by receiving the word without restriction amen we just yield your yield yielding is giving the right of way for cars right you see the sign you just yield it's not a big deal and that's how it should be when the word says we just yield it and we show our love to it and it gives us discernment to see faith because when you get to you get the word of god even your eyes the way you see things is like a god it starts becoming like god you see i say this because we're still human so so the more you get to the word of god your eyes keep changing amen then you start discerning things better when people don't see anything you see it because you are an eagle your eyes can see where normal eyes don't see do we agree actually discernment is very important whatever i'm saying in discerning the body of the lord you say in 1959 now our eternal destination is not all together determined by what we see and what we hear but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear actually will determine where we go oh we heard something we came to church and we went back and he didn't do anything oh my i don't want to praise our church or do something but you come here spend a month too and go and say it's just the same no no i've been in this message for many years now god has been gracious to us he has raised our level amen it's for a purpose not for us to go around no is to give us the god's attributes amen display them his reason is sitting on the right hand the bible even say that it will be revealed and we will also be revealed we he has revealed himself now hallelujah we have to display those attributes now amen the world is waiting for those attributes to be manifested the nature is screaming crying oh where are the sons of god i want them now display the attributes of god amen can i become religious a little bit amen you know like army in the army they say permission to speak sir say go ahead sorry i gotta do that ah wow after this i won't need to run on my treadmill all right hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is the discern of the thoughts and intents of the heart ah a judge has a spirit of discernment it can discern things that people don't see the world is praising this but the discernment of the word tells you no that's not that do we agree amen let me move on a a good judge is no respecter of persons is that right that's what makes them the good the more you get the word of god you get that that attribute is my brother is my sister maybe we're not always together but it's my brother is my sister i hear that they got a problem are gonna pray about it sincerely no respecter of persons that's what the scripture says act chapter 10 34 then peter opened his mouth and said of truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fear him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him yes that's god is not so god doesn't say well you are young therefore what do you have to say no oh you are a woman god doesn't even do that actually when you talk men and women is in in in term of the order in term of odor god does that you can take god has an order in the house god has an order in a church but as to respect of people no i was i was actually uh looking at this aspect of things you know brother bernhard had thousand thousand of visions he saw the angel in in person he saw he he went through a lot of things but i realized that when brother bran someone a brother comes to him and tell him something that god told him he appreciated very much when he comes from somebody else than himself he appreciated very much and then i i saw that he was sick you know how brother brennan went in a cycle of sickness seven days is sick seven years every time he's sickened is so emanciated he's is so you know has this burned his in this praying and god is answering his prayer for other people but not for him he needs somebody to he needs comfort he need and then god chooses who to tell him about it a woman a sister she come to church she she she's sick verbum lays hand on her and then as whatever is living she sees the man in a white robe and the men look at uh at her and say oh let me just go to it the angel of god 19 when when you was praying this is the husband telling brother brandon what happened that day she seemed like she was in a trance until we got home and she asked me who was that other man that came come down there with you when you were praying for her and i said there was no other man say oh yes the woman said yes a man with the white robe on with dark and on with dark hair i say say say that again brother i say that's brother branham say that again again say that again brother and he say it again i say that is the angel of the lord that appeared see she said why it was looking down upon brother branham when he was praying and said he talked to me and he said now you are looking for healing say brother brahms prayer will be answered you will be healed but say doesn't brother branham look awful frail say but you will be strong after a while so that give me encouragement see he will be strong after a while a woman it should be by the both worlds by the baxter brother lindsey lindsay or any big minister no a sister because god is no respecter of people if you serve him you'll be blessed by him amen do we agree yes that's true it is no respect amen he's a good judge and he say we will manifest those attributes god granted to me to manifest those attributes a good judge is fair he has a fairness is that right yeah this is not an attribute we go to god and say to god god be fair no i know why i say this you will see it in a while when god says god's love is uh elective love we don't go and pick it on his door and say how can you say that because when we hear god love is elective we say amen we don't say that's not fair we say amen to that i'm saying this because not everybody does that you remember brother billy paul testimony where a man brought to his boss brother message book and the boss read and say this man is calling me a buzzard and the men say but it's calling me an ego is that right so oh my yeah i was in a charlotte not long ago and the pastor was preaching and saying he caught by the venomous say eight people maybe saved and he says he's not even sure that handful will be and the pastor say okay well uh eight people of course brother barum talks about a lot of things about that he said eight people he count himself his wife his children his father uh his son-in-law then account he was eighteen he said what that leaves you [Music] where that leaves you and but the reality is when the prophet said to us if it's one you must say it's me therefore you cannot say to god that's not fair i won't go to church because eight people that will be almost a pastor's family with sister emily sorry sister and he did not say that he said you gotta put yourself in let god do is mathematic because god is the one who creates mathematic so if the if we say one i go because actually the problem is him with himself if i'm not with him is not complete therefore i don't care about numbers i care to be found in faith faith of the word of god in this time amen now what i'm when i was talking about fairness all that i was thinking about satan and his children those are the ones always go to god as a judge but for fairness yeah that's how they that the they are the one look genesis chapter 4 verse 13 and cain said unto the lord after he slew abel now he's in the presence of god you and i after we did anything we go into the presence of god oh my the first thing is god be merciful to me i know i did it last time i'm doing it right now but be meant for to me that's the first thing but you see cain comes in the presence of god you remember i am i the keeper of my brother they have such a courage and when when when john sees the prank god he falls down like a dead his majesty how great that was but look a king i don't know where my brother is liar am i the keeper of my brother liar how much how can you have such a courage in the presence of the almighty god and when he goes there is concern about himself is self preservation and can say unto the lord my punishment is greater than i i can bear it's not fair isn't fair i wish i could speak better english like southern english in fair that's why he said he's calling upon the attribute of god as a judge but since he's already condemned he wants fairness behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from the thy face shall be shall i be healed and i shall be a fugitive and a vegan in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me i need self-preservation you must protect me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold you see loving judge oh my and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him god put the mark on cain and his children and cain went out from the presence of the lord and he just left no forgive me lord no and dwelt in the land of node on the east of eden it came to what i'm going to call it came looking for the rules of engagement the people that have been in the army may tell you about that one once one army defeated the other army there are some rules that apply you know so if you get some prisoners there are rules of geneve rules whatever the conventions and hague so what is coming to us god is the rules of engagement for self-preservation how can i survive live the rules of engagement when two armies before starting the war the two armies have to declare war and if they are children and civilians oh you gotta protect them that rules of engagement is that why he came he said i'm a defeated army i'm wounded you gotta protect me you and i our life is already hidden in christ yes oh my cain my punishment is greater so basically say to god your judgment was not fair what a courage they have no wonder god say don't lean toward that kingdom lean toward this kingdom rules of engagement treatment of prisoners of war that's why i say i'm a prisoner of war you had to protect me i have the right not to believe the revelation i have the right to reject revelation i have the right to sin disbelief yes cain the right for to sin is one of the most protected right you have under the law in this country but the right to serve god and worship him you know according to the revelation ah brother banana pray that that's right let it last long whatever i'm saying lord let it last long and we will do the same we do the same prayer this this morning let it last long are you with me on this job chapter 1. job chapter 1 verse 9 then set an answer to the lord and say dost job fear god for nothing has not now made an age about him and about his house and and about all that he had on every side thou has to bless the work of his hands and the substances increase in his his land ain't fair you gave him all that's why he serve you but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he had and he will curse thee to thy face church when you look at the children of lucifer cain and so on it's when they approach god is about fairness you didn't give me a chance to touch job same thing happened to peter but take this scripture and match it with when satan told the satan came to god and say i want to sift peter sift him like a grain yeah he says it was the same thing he went there and said well he never been tested that peter has never been tested i want to test him it's always about fairness be careful church we love fairness but uh be careful amen the fairness is about self-preservation john chapter 12 i want to read much of it 12 is about the woman that brought this big perfume to i known to jesus and guess who saw it a problem 12 4 then sayeth one of his disciples judas is scared simon's son which should betray him why was not this anointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor [Music] he has more love than god is that true no he doesn't it basically saying it's not fair to take all this perfume and use it for one man fairness they go to the judge for fairness but i was actually this is say not uh that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put there it was taking the money oh but god is so god obey to his own laws he always has the fairness you saw how he treated cain he said i will protect you yeah and he does everything with that model in mind we kept the door of the ark for seven days he knew that nobody will get in but you could not accuse him of lack of fairness seven days the ark is open but nobody gets in there'll be a time like that but he will never be declared he does always things like that because he's a fair judge how can he get his children to recognize the world and give the opportunity to other children too so he is fair do you understand yeah that's why he has 1200 messages on the internet everybody can read it because god is fair even our sermons in this church they are on the internet you think you are being blessed and all that but you know the lord whosoever wants can just go to archives but guess what they won't because god is hidden in the plain view because the judge it doesn't want to be blamed for anybody the message is there we preach openly but only his children will see others won't see but he's in a plain view how did god heed christ in the eyes of israel by putting god in a man and when israel saw a man there is a man how god is hiding christ from the gentiles church by putting in a man god in plain god view plain view okay let me change the gesture god in plain view god in plain view amen how does he do it oh okay should not read a lot of things because i'm slow i i i just read the bottom there it's some it's uh it's uh the thing sometimes we have to say things the church a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out some to live and some to ponder over same message some take it stay with it and some will leave that's how it works but is there in the open open competition that's what cain is asking open competition shenanigans i'm so sorry i i'm still learning english so if i say a word that is not right all right but that's done god done that purposely it must be done that way then it might be that some would say you mean god will purpose to do a thing like that he certainly did he does yet he said one day when he was thousand around him he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man or son of god or son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you i was a message preached to everyone at the same time some say where can we go others say i'm not going to drink anybody's blood plain view that is fairness actually a big portion of my thought was on this because i came across this whoa look what satan looks for when you go to the lord it's a deep adoration sincere god i love you god you always forgive me without your grace where could i be you you appreciated him when they go he's like it's fair you don't treat me right same message that's what the gospel always does it opens the eyes of some reveals the truth to some why it blinds the others has a four twofold meaning uh some can take that sun and look straight into it and and go blind others can take it and walk out with it is the difference do we now agree god the judge he has a fairness amen amen therefore those we love we just keep praying for them god will put that on their path something would happen reclaim them the prophet says and the prophets say confession and committing are two powerful tools we can keep just confessing about it and committing it to him it will do that i want to bring you attention to some some more thing here luke chapter 17. i'm not going to read it i just took the resume of it i mean just looking at luke 17 i jesus is talking and he starts 17 22 you say there will be days where the son of man will be manifest on earth we know this day right then he goes 1724 is coming can be compared to a lightning then he goes to 17 26 he said the conditions on the earth will be like in the days of noah then he goes and he says in 1728 he said the condition on earth will be also like in sodom and where you know lot was in sodom and abram was in the mountains and he goes in 1730 a son of man will reveal the son of man is that right and then 17 35 you say two together ah one will be taken one will stay rapture time and that rapture is happening every day it's alright we were all in that world of uh world systems the church systems one is taken the other is left yes how do we found that the ego will be where we'll gather egos plural sorry we'll gather where the body is is that yes that's how you find uh you find him is when he reveal himself when he comes you find him where the egos gather together where the the egos will not just gather together for a meal which is great but for the body the meal the spiritual meal yes in the message the anointing of end time he said the angel was not this the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he is the one that you are feeding on you are not feeding on a man a man his word will fail but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man you want to find the eagles go where the body word is the unfailing one hey man amen so i brought all this story because of what comes next look 18. now jesus is talking about prophecy things that will happen one day you will want to see one of the days of the son of man are you you know he said there will be a day where son of man christ will be on earth yeah that's what he said and one son of man will reveal the son of man and then when the son of man is gone when a son of man is gone is the ministry of the son of man finished still here he's still here so then then jesus continues in the next chapter 18 is that a story what we will say out of the blue i start the story and people and he speak a parable unto them to this end that men are always to pray and not to faint saying that was in the city a judge judge which fear not god not a good judge neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city she came unto him saying he avenged me of my adversary and he will not for a while but afterward he say within himself though i fear not god no nor regard man verse five yet because this widow troubles me i will avenge her lest by her continue coming she worry me and the lord say hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless this is where i want to go back nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he found find faith on earth well the story was really out of the blue then he he tied it to the coming of the lord did you notice he started the story of a a judge a woman that was a a widow could that just be it was continuing the same story that day in the end time in the time of the revelation and the coming of the son of man christ will come as a judge with a winged white wing of the judges in england is that right to give back to this woman her properties and rights amen for people for years people looked at her as a widow because they say her husband jesus christ died and was buried therefore whatever she says doesn't matter she must be a widow if you are not the widow where is your husband they say they mistreat her but the bad by by the adversary the formidable adversary me treats her this great adversary this big one mistreat her and she's asking god for judgment she's going to ask god for avenge for victory upon her her enemy that's not that tells you what happened in our time when the cloud came what was it it was the judge himself brother branham saw the vision of it he saw a big bro he told the people when he went to sunset monkey he saw it again it happened he told the people when the picture was taken he told people turn the picture to the right why people hate it so much then they attack it the judge is back to give to the bride her rights what she deserves her title deed amen no wonder they attack it but is uh to avenge her to give her her place the word is calling us to place us positionally in what we supposed to have that's why the judge came amen he came in a cloud the picture was taken it's time to go back to our property the word of god the judge has come it's wonderful amen when the judge comes he gives us what belongs to us it judges our enemy again i'll go back to say the enemy is this human spirit that we bear the enemy satan is the enemy but he works through a human mind and yet god say that i will restore i will install these days he came back to restore what was taken what belongs to us i can see him here there is this woman her life is a mess as we can say and she goes to to brother branham to pray for her just to see how much has been taken to us how much this world the nature the the trees the all the nature are screaming crying where are the sons of god they crying out the manifestations of son of god because when the sons of god get their attributes their whole nature is restored i saw this story in god revealing himself to his people it's in a 50 god uh he say he's talking to a woman by the brand i'm wary and the sun looks gloomy is discerning your life is contacting this human spirit that you and i have and everything like that she's gloomy what does that mean anxiety what is it [Music] and everything limbs seems like a phobia what is it a fear that you can't control you get scared at things a phobia a fear that she has she realized that is not normal she has to go to him the word and the word will discern what is going on now it's it's not no more it's not that right now standing longer and longer you just make it just keep in thinking you you want him to get well i'm going to ask jesus now to heal you i believe he will do it don't you sister all right you come just a little closer now you've had quite a struggle in life anyhow isn't that you know what i'm speaking of i don't have to say it oh must be hard it must be terrible thing something that comes from phobia but you know what i'm speaking of the word discern anything the body the spirit and the soul when you got the word you got everything east esther made the right choice she went to the word and the word comes with gifts she did not go after gifts she went after the giver so she can have the gifts the word comes with deliverance praise god for that how many people go through a lot of things and nobody knows and barabam says even doctors don't know what's going on but here is the word i don't want to say brother planet i'm saying the word discerning this woman that she had phobia i don't know if that phobia was when she was younger i don't know she had this phobia she has some sort of maybe anxiety for something and but doesn't want to say what that's what that does to her it's it cannot tell everything because it's her problem so it must be between her and god and then you say our heavenly father by your spirit look down through the stream of time oh you are here dear jesus you are so lovely and kind and we love you with all our heart and our sister standing here has been bound by an oppression of satan foul spirits have tried to pray to put pride upon her oh phobia depression or anxiety then pride the prophet is connecting the guts is discerning if we love the word we absorb the word we keep eating the word it will discern what is in us what we need to do where we need to go what do we need to be done the word is a designer he will give us a solution to things that we we don't understand what to do you will discern that this is had some strange things happening in your life could that be that she if you have phobia you feel something that that phobia gives you pride it doesn't seem to be connected but it is connected and then and it does give you something that brother branham cannot talk about in the audience what that means is it a bad atmosphere in your life around you around people that are with you it creates some atmosphere that atmosphere comes from a phobia and that create pride because when somebody steps on your way your pride comes in but what did she do she went to the judge and say i want justice i come here to sue to accuse this enemy this is not me this is not my idea i create an atmosphere maybe it's an atmosphere of rage that people can't stand because of phobia because of pride who brings pride who start pride satan lucifer himself and all this better banner let me just say again the world connects the dots it will connect that in our lives who thinks that don't make sense if god wanted to make sense he will do it it will give us the discernment because the word is like a two egg sword amen are you angry all right no i i get i came across this without knowing it that's how it works ask preachers yeah now what did she do she's not identified by her human spirit she's deeper than her human spirit and she knows where the solution is the judge supreme judge is able to remove this the word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and prabhanam pray for her he say that but thou where was i actually reading and our sister standing here has been bound by no prey oppression of satan far spirit have tried to put pride upon her but thou art here to remove this curse of the enemy for you say the last word from your sacred lips that you were living the world you say this signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out devils help me dear lord destro faith against the enemy so after this hopefully after this you will when you hear god is a judge you won't feel wary you will bring your enemy that person facing the mirror to him because you always stand in god's way so you cannot serve him as you wish you go and say i want justice and he will give you justice do you believe that overcoming means recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people they says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there is a real devil is just as real as you are and anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must is a devil and then the same thing at the same time to you you recognize him you know he's the devil is against you then to overcome you must recognize that god is greater and mightier than he is that the one that is in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen there is real overcoming when you recognize amen how can i overcome 1963 the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing surrender yourself to him he over he overcome for you he knows the way we don't amen how can i do it take the word heck the word brother branham questions and answer 1964 how can a christian get deeper in the love of god read the word and pray read the word and pray the preacher is a transmitter a signal booster read the word of god and pray amen it will give you strength now guess what the devil doesn't like that he never wants us to have time even to pray and he uses something that he uses the insecurity living in this flesh the words say to turn our affection to set our affection on high but yet because of this humanity this enemy we don't want to talk much about him i agree because we don't want to focus on him right but we have to recognize his tactics anyway then move on read and pray will the devil let you pray i am guilty for that i'm i can be on my computer that's not right hopefully by preaching it i'll be aware of it but yet god has always always provided even when i was unable to even speak the language right i could not even i could not even ask somebody something he was always protecting the feeding the family taking care of the family what is wrong but i'm saying man stop man after men stop walking with god he now has to shift himself that's the word barbara use is a very good word very good english for me if i can say that he shifts himself now he has to fight you see him suspicious here uh it's not me actually it's very very name i just don't have the coat here it's suspicious but he got take care that's why we don't spend time like the pastor was saying that give him time give him time but you got to take it back go to the judge and say i want my time back because he always provided he always take care of his children is all over the world i i remember even we just fight to get to keep our jobs that's why we do all this we spend all these times i want to keep my job i have a mortgage i have children guilty the time is when the time is left then i give you so that's a basic gospel i'm sure but this is a reality in my life i i saw him in a time where i could not qualify for anything almost he was always taking care of me where is this anxiety i gotta keep my job you know instead of spending more time with him do the job because the prophets say that you got to be the best at your work is the word too but you have determined hours and things you can do that i even remember a time where uh i had a manager that was not very very good to me he made my you know work really hard screaming yelling whatever and god has a sense of humor you know that they demoted her and made me a manager there was a group there they gave me manager a few years later she i went to a different company she came looking for a job so where i was asking me a job those are little things that tells you god cares but yet because our affections sometimes turn to this system sometimes all our debate that we do is just because we are insecure we're thinking about the children our grandchildren our argument should be upon the word of god if the argument is upon our ideas our insecurity god will not back the map are you with me the kingdom of god backs only his own word sometimes in a short run it looks like you are defeated but in the long run it's good to stay with the world when we talk to our children grandchildren whatever it is let our argument if we can say argument i know christians don't argue but you understand let it be the word of god i remember bringing the word to my my children constantly constantly then one day one went to college my first daughter rebecca she went to college the challenge of her now i was like i never seen children rejecting the word church seriously was a big problem for me i even called by the lonely jenkins he said to me in some way is healthy that the children question what they believe he's saying you are not stronger than the holy ghost but you know what happened is what i told her was not a mix of word and wisdom it was the word therefore when they challenged her it was the kingdom of god had to fight the fight not me and then they challenge her she's in a college and she has all this uh healthy department college where all the kids that don't want to drink don't want to go out they all gather together and they have like a denominational services where they read the bible and they challenge her she's always in dress and skirts and you know when we take our ideas the idea we took in the media here in the internet and we mix them together we give to children one day they will be challenged then they will reject the whole thing but if you stay with the world they can challenge it they can throw it reject it but at the end you will have victory because the whole kingdom of god is behind you that's what happened that those days were gloomy days and she received the holy ghost praise god now i can rest then a few times maybe a few months later to me god show me priscilla and enoch receiving the holy ghost i don't like to talk about that but it was tremendous it was amazing because the devil was so angry that that day i had a terrible nightmare i saw a master coming to swallow me just i look at the scriptures that the devil does that is like a lion going around and when i woke up i told my wife sister jose i say i had a terrible nightmare today it was awful she said don't tell me i will tell you what i saw exactly the same monster why it doesn't want to let go and that week they had special meetings something changed in their life but sometimes christian we found ourselves with all kind of argument deaths and that but god will not back the map he will only back his word and after he lost his fellowship that's the basis of fellowship after he lost his fellowship with god he became become a wanderer had to shift for himself god taken care of him before then but now he finds he has to shift for himself it's a pretty hard thing so he doesn't have a loving father to watch over him and protect him and guide him and direct him and feed him and clothe him and care for him like he did so instead of coming back he tries to find his own way he wants to make his own way back man wants to make his own way he's always had always he will i suppose try to find his own way and every time you make his own way as always it gets wrong only the word of god we try to shift ourself yeah god doesn't back anything that is not his word our argument is better that i say i say to it's better i said to my children that this is my opinion this is why i say but this is the word of god and you may not have you may not understand it just like brother brenham talks about the two brothers god told them to build a house uh the church somewhere and they brought them to the court because they want to build something maybe public something that will give money to the to the town or whatever they say they have to sell their property and they say we won't do that because god told us that they brought them to the court and the attorney or the prosecutor was just attacking them and say why do you no one do this and they say oh god told us leave god out of that we don't want any god in this emo ridicule them it doesn't matter the kingdom of god is behind you when you repeat the word and you love the world god is not obligated to back you when you talk about your own stuff so church let's last minute i wrote this down okay okay i'm i'm finishing now let's just read that uh 1959 f 59 joe fajara we are glad to have a real god a real bible and god that stays behind his word and backs up every word he says i'm so happy to know that if he's his word he's going to back it up if his word is going to impact your life if his word is going to generate god's attributes one of our attributes of god is the judge the discerner of the thoughts discern of confusion discern leads a guide it directs you the word of god is full with all the vitamins and minerals and proteins and everything that when they come in our body we don't know how this works we don't know the mechanism but it works therefore we stay with the word and turn our affections toward that kingdom the kingdom of god [Music] how just loving more then you start displaying because this time is the time where christ is revealed then you will start displaying him because of what you have absorbed god help us help me stay with the world and you will display those attributes that's why the reason why you are in this world is to display those attributes may god help us musicians if you can come little stand and if he then if then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things of the earth how the more you eat it the more you don't have room for others the more you eat it it becomes part of you if it becomes part of you what is you are is attributes are you attributes god has so many attributes was thinking about attributes of love we don't even have understood the attribute of love at least to me i look sometimes we we see it as empathy because you can see brother branham looking at this mexican man before he prays for him he check if he can give him his suits he put himself in his literally in his issues he put his shoes close to his and say he feels about him that's still human but it's important to say i cast out demons by love oh my and then there is a love that he understands the anger of the bulls or the harness you understand i disturb you this is your territory god-given place i disturb you that's another love i mean a manifestation of love but then he says that that something comes on me the bull will kill me because i have no weapon but suddenly something comes over me i don't fear anymore church i want to get to that love where there is no self-preservation i want to protect myself my life is important no self perservation but i'm got this twice no fear we gotta get that it's god's attributes we will get that but we have it now amen the word that we have has all this potential in them but we we accept it live it go with it work with it it will start just manifesting i want to manifest that love where i don't care about self-preservation and that's what causes all kind of things that we have today people want to self-preserve preserve and they are fearing the fear for the future for the children the grandchildren and they try to shift themselves here and there compromise here and there but if you lean onto that kingdom that's what we need god help us i don't say have attained if we have the world then this other kingdom will decrease the other kingdom will increase god bless you thank you for listening for me to me for so long amen isn't it wonderful amen for the band [Music] on earth to be from earth to glory [Music] to be [Music] let's pray precious heavenly father what you have placed on my heart is now on your children's hearts this is not new things but today for this time this is what you gave us father it is since it's your word [Music] let your children yield that word it will reproduce itself according to its own kind the crime of the word of god manifested in this time the message of the hour heavenly father help us not to shift ourselves to be so wary anxious but to turn our affection toward you manifest your nature manifest your attributes attributes of love attribute of faith attributes of a judge one day we will sit with you [Music] and we'll judge the world oh heavenly father we need a character to do that and we must get the character right now today not another day but today help us father every time i'll be spending time working and working father remind me this message this morning [Music] so i can yield to you and serve you spend time with you [Music] granted father your grace and mercy bless our pastor his family as the officials of this church the people brothers and sisters don't let anyone go back the way they come in god answer each and everyone's prayer i commit them all to you in jesus christ's name amen [Music] if you can come to be like jesus [Music] to be like jesus on earth to be like all through life's churning [Music] to be hallelujah i enjoyed the word today i want to be molded amen just exactly in the way it was preached is what i want in my life i want to set my affections on thing or above and i want brother baby said you reflect what you're pointing to what you're looking at and what we spend our time looking at is what we begin to reflect and i want to reflect the very life and nature of my father oh we were given good tools today how many thankful that you have a good judge amen and he's fair and whatever he does is he does well and whatever happens in our life is for good not for evil and if we can just learn to say thank you father for everything that happens we're going to find ourselves having victory faster and faster and faster we're going to find we have the right approach to everything that happens in our life when we realize that his ways are perfect and his judgments are true and everything he does is for good and i need to learn to trust in him and all those things in me that are holding back the expression of god there's a judge here to judge that too amen i can just lay myself on the bench and say father this hybrid flesh that i come to and no fault of my own that's what brother madam said no fault of your own you were trapped into it it's causing me problems and i ask that you judge it and make it match your word amen how about saying it this way lord jesus this body that you bought [Music] that you own that you possess amen i'm not my own i've been bought with the price lord this body that you paid for is causing me problems would you please help me because my desire is to match your word my longing is to match your nature my greatest desire is to manifest you amen but this flesh this body this mind whatever it is is holding me back i pray that you judge it and you correct it by your word and help me to overcome it's not it's not just when we sing this song to be like jesus it's not just our desire i mean we could never have that desire if it wasn't his plan and if it didn't serve his purpose if it wasn't first god's idea it would never be our desire it's our desire because first it was his idea and as much as we want to be like him it proves that he more it's a greater desire for him at the desire of the word because he had the desire first so what do we do what brother kadima said just yield focus on things that are above and just heal he says the bride becomes the word by letting the word flow through her we've got to allow it amen we're going to be let you let you be dismissed in the name of the lord say it's been good to be here today i said god let me walk out of here different than when i came in let me take your word and faith in your word with the revelation that you're here to bring your word to pass let me walk away with that confidence amen let's just pray a prayer of thanksgiving for the word lord jesus we thank you for your word god we know that lord that that word is you on display it carries your power it carries your life it carries your attributes and we receive it now by faith lord and as we fed on it here tonight and we've received it is coming from you i pray lord that you would let it go to work in our lives and bring about all the manifestation that it was intended to that it would bring us life not a natural life but a spiritual life that it would bring a manifestation of that life and it would reflect on the outside of us bless our brother john lord strengthen him and his family lord i pray that you pour back into him more than he poured out today god as we walk from here let us go with a greater confidence in you and in your word and let us stay with your word and watch you do marvelous abundantly above what we could ask or think help us to have our greatest confidence not in ourselves let us not even focus on ourselves but let us focus on your word and watch you do wonderful things let us go from here with that attitude with that approach with that mind may you have your way with us in jesus christ's name amen god bless you all for the benefits make me [Music] give me [Music] love and make me more like [Music] jesus make me like these [Music] [Music] with oh keep your mind stayed on
