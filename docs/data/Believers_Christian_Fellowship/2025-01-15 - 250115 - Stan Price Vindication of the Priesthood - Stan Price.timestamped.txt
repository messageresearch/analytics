[5:15] this is the first time for many of you
[5:17] to get acquainted with him him and I are
[5:19] new friends we just met for the first
[5:20] time last year and had some fellowship
[5:23] as he was passing through on his way to
[5:25] visit a daughter and I so enjoyed the
[5:27] fellowship that we shared it was so
[5:29] meaningful to me and and the vision that
[5:31] he has for the word it was so
[5:33] encouraging to me and so we've found out
[5:36] that he was coming back to visit a
[5:37] daughter again he was in the area and he
[5:39] was gracious enough to extend his trip
[5:41] he and his wife extended their trip just
[5:43] a little bit so they include us and so
[5:45] they'll be heading back he's a pastor in
[5:47] a church in nvar Florida he's been a
[5:49] pastor for 17 years there now so they'll
[5:51] be heading back there tomorrow but I'm
[5:53] so glad that you can get acquainted with
[5:55] him because the fellowship we've shared
[5:56] over the last two days has been really
[5:58] sweet really good and so I've been
[6:00] looking forward to hearing him come we
[6:03] want him to feel at home amen we want
[6:05] him to relax brother brandom said the
[6:06] key to operating a gift is to relax amen
[6:09] and we I know we can help him relax amen
[6:12] if we'll just pull on the word and
[6:13] receive What the Lord Has for us so we
[6:15] want brother Stan to come at this time
[6:17] and we want him to be able to relax take
[6:19] his time and share what the Lord has
[6:21] given to him and uh we just want to
[6:23] welcome him amen let's sing a song as he
[6:28] comes consum
[6:31] to me
[6:34] Lord by the
[6:37] fire of your
[6:41] spirit
[6:43] [Laughter]
[6:44] consume me
[6:48] Lord and make me
[6:52] more
[6:56] you
[6:58] break me
[7:02] Lord and bless the
[7:06] broken
[7:08] pie of my
[7:14] life let
[7:19] be
[7:22] Lord I once more consume
[7:27] me thank you Lord
[7:31] cons me
[7:35] Lord
[7:37] the of your
[7:42] spirit
[7:45] consume me
[7:49] Lord and make me more
[7:54] [Music]
[7:56] like break
[7:59] be
[8:04] lordless the
[8:06] broken
[8:08] PES of
[8:14] my let me be
[8:18] used oh
[8:23] Lord
[8:26] you you know is that your prayer this
[8:28] evening
[8:30] you know if we get consumed by him
[8:32] there's nothing
[8:33] left right that's the objective you know
[8:36] the objective is not for us to come to
[8:38] some kind of a exaltation of you know
[8:42] the sunship is Christ in you amen the
[8:45] hope of glory I mean he's the son and so
[8:48] the the whole idea of Christianity is
[8:52] for us to die cuz the Bible said we were
[8:54] crucified with Christ if I'm crucified
[8:57] with Christ then there's nothing left of
[8:59] me
[9:00] the only one that's left is Christ
[9:03] because the life that I now live in the
[9:05] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[9:08] God and so that's what Christianity is
[9:10] about it's about not accumulating
[9:13] knowledge but about surrender and
[9:16] sacrifice while you're standing thank
[9:18] you very much for the music I enjoyed it
[9:20] let's turn to our Bibles uh to Hebrews
[9:23] the 9th
[9:24] chapter and we'll read a couple of
[9:27] verses maybe the uh I we'll read the
[9:30] first uh five verses of of Hebrews the
[9:33] 9th chapter I'm I'm so excited to be
[9:36] here I I was actually here a long time
[9:40] ago about 20 years uh my wife and I and
[9:45] and and a couple of other couples that
[9:47] came with us uh sat right there in the
[9:49] back brother Lonnie uh preached a
[9:51] message that morning and and uh but I
[9:54] never in a million years thought that I
[9:56] would be standing in this Pulpit right
[9:58] here
[10:00] in fact that was 2005 and uh I never
[10:03] even thought I was going to be a pastor
[10:06] you know but the Lord directs our past
[10:08] you know we don't know you know he we're
[10:10] bought with a price you know we can we
[10:13] can have all our life plans and our
[10:15] goals and that's and that's fine that's
[10:18] fine but everything is at the mercy of
[10:20] his will and and you know he he knows
[10:25] what he wants to do with you and so
[10:28] whenever we're willing to sacrifice our
[10:30] life then well the prophet said the the
[10:33] the greatest enemy I had is William
[10:35] brandham and he said if I can get that
[10:38] guy out of the way he can do great
[10:40] things that William brandom knows
[10:42] nothing about and I'll tell you what if
[10:45] the Lord is it blesses us tonight it
[10:47] won't be stand price I can promise you
[10:50] that had a say tell him brother Chad I
[10:52] had a friend of M or one of the sisters
[10:54] in the church she and and I've been in
[10:57] the church since the year after it
[10:59] started in
[11:01] 1969 and there was a sister that was
[11:03] there probably from the mid 70s and when
[11:06] I became Pastor she said I know this is
[11:09] the Lord because I know Stan
[11:13] price and so so you may not know stand
[11:16] price but if there's anything good that
[11:18] happens here tonight it's going to be
[11:19] the will of the Lord I believe that
[11:22] Hebrews the 9th chapter and we'll read
[11:24] from the first verse then verily the
[11:26] first Covenant had also ordinances of
[11:29] divine service and a worldly sanctuary
[11:32] and there was a tabernacle made the
[11:33] first wherein was the Candlestick and
[11:36] the table and the showbread which is
[11:38] called the sanctuary and after the
[11:39] second Veil The Tabernacle which is
[11:42] called the holiest of all which had the
[11:44] golden sensor and the Ark of the
[11:46] Covenant overlaid with uh roundabout
[11:49] with gold wherein was the golden pot
[11:51] that had mana and Aaron's Rod that
[11:53] budded and the tables of the Covenant
[11:55] and over at a cherubim over at the
[11:56] cherubims of Glory shattering the mercy
[11:59] seed of which we now or cannot now speak
[12:02] particularly let's bow our hearts our
[12:04] wonderful uh heavenly father as our
[12:07] brother Chad has already uh uh prayed in
[12:10] the back there Lord we believe that we
[12:12] have come here by a Divine appointment
[12:15] we believe before the foundation of the
[12:17] world uh you have directed the paths of
[12:20] each person here and you've placed them
[12:21] at this place right now and we are
[12:24] believing father that you're the one
[12:26] that's send control of this this meeting
[12:29] tonight and and we commit ourselves uh
[12:31] into your wonderful and Loving Hands may
[12:35] may uh your word go forth and have its
[12:38] free course in our lives and and may it
[12:41] not return to us void and we pray in the
[12:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God
[12:46] bless you you can be
[12:50] seated I'm I'm going to preach something
[12:52] here tonight that I've I've never
[12:55] haven't preached at home we've been in a
[12:57] study of the book of Hebrews at home for
[13:00] U well about two years and uh and we're
[13:04] up to chapter
[13:05] nine and and uh the the book of Hebrews
[13:09] is an amazing amazing book in fact I you
[13:13] know if I was cast into prison and I can
[13:16] only choose one book of the Bible I
[13:17] would choose the book of Hebrews because
[13:20] the book of Hebrews the prophet said
[13:22] that did Paul is appearing law and
[13:26] Grace and and and that's and that's true
[13:29] but let's look at it a little bit deeper
[13:31] because the law came because of time the
[13:33] law came because of sin right because it
[13:36] was it was never you know we can look at
[13:38] things and we can say that it was never
[13:40] God God's plan covered everything okay
[13:42] I'm not saying it wasn't part of God's
[13:43] plan but when God brought Israel to the
[13:46] mountain he didn't offer them a law he
[13:49] offered them a
[13:51] relationship in fact if you if you study
[13:53] the scripture uh you know they God you
[13:57] know wanted Israel to come to the
[13:59] mountain and everything and then Moses
[14:00] said well hey wait you you told the
[14:02] people that they couldn't come to this
[14:04] mountain you know that that if they came
[14:06] to the mountain they would die or
[14:07] whatever and the Lord said it's not you
[14:10] know it wasn't that the Lord was going
[14:11] to speak directly to Israel but if you
[14:14] read the the scripture carefully they
[14:17] were going to be able to hear the voice
[14:19] of God when he spoke to
[14:22] Moses and it and and they said when they
[14:24] heard the trumpet sounding and
[14:26] everything they said well we don't want
[14:27] to hear this' you know because we're
[14:29] going to die well that's really the
[14:32] objective amen the objective is to hear
[14:35] the voice of God and die right but but
[14:39] they but they didn't want that so they
[14:41] said just tell us what God wants us to
[14:44] do and we'll do it well God did what
[14:48] they asked and he gave them a law but he
[14:50] also knew that they would never be able
[14:52] to keep it so he gave them a
[14:54] sacrifice they never asked for a
[14:56] sacrifice they said just tell us what we
[14:58] need to do but God knew that they could
[15:00] never keep the law so he gave them a
[15:02] sacrifice and that sacrifice represented
[15:07] Christ because there's no way that we
[15:10] can by
[15:11] commandment keep the word of
[15:13] God and so so the law represented a Time
[15:19] condition right but Grace is something
[15:22] that has no boundary of time amen
[15:26] because even in the garden you know we
[15:28] look at no no because Noah I think means
[15:31] rest and and we talk about Grace and and
[15:34] then we talk about the Life of Christ
[15:36] and Grace was extended and so forth but
[15:38] really
[15:40] Grace existed in the Garden of Eden
[15:43] because Adam was was created in the
[15:46] image of God but Adam had the privilege
[15:49] of fellowship with God and he never
[15:52] earned that amen and so that was God's
[15:56] grace and so and so kind of in a in in
[15:59] in a way that I like to look at things
[16:01] because I always like to as as a message
[16:04] as as someone's been in the message a
[16:06] long time I was telling brother Chad
[16:08] today something that's really affected
[16:09] my life a lot is that I like to look at
[16:13] things and try to understand how things
[16:17] would be had there never been a
[16:20] fall and so because eternity didn't stop
[16:23] in the garden that's right When sin
[16:25] happened eternity is going on right now
[16:27] eternity is right now it's it's right
[16:29] here right now that's right that's right
[16:31] right in fact there was a testimony I
[16:32] share this because I think this was this
[16:34] was really good there was a we had a
[16:36] watch Night Service New Year's I wasn't
[16:38] there but the brothers decided to have
[16:40] it without me which really made me
[16:43] happy I mean it made me happy brother
[16:46] Chad that they were willing to that I
[16:48] was not the the Lynch pen that held the
[16:50] whole church together that caused thing
[16:52] to happen so they had testimonies and
[16:54] this one
[16:56] sister she had a testimony she says I'm
[16:58] standing at the window washing dishes
[17:01] and I look out and there's my cat
[17:03] playing in the backyard and she thought
[17:07] what day does he think it
[17:11] is and and and she said he thinks it's
[17:14] just now yeah and and so tomorrow will
[17:19] he recognize that there was a yesterday
[17:21] no it'll just be today and she said
[17:25] that's the way God is amen there's no
[17:27] yesterday There's No Tomorrow there's
[17:30] only now there's only a god he's he said
[17:34] I am the I am and so if you look
[17:37] carefully at the book of Hebrews Paul is
[17:40] is really showing you the difference
[17:44] between Time and
[17:47] Eternity and so and he illustrates it
[17:50] this way because you would think it all
[17:53] of Paul's writings you know when he's
[17:54] dealing with Redemption and he's dealing
[17:56] with and and the book of Hebrews deals
[17:58] with Redemption but the book of Hebrews
[18:00] deals more with the result of redemption
[18:03] than it does with the actual Redemption
[18:06] process now he's talking about he's
[18:08] talking about uh here even in this
[18:10] chapter in chapter 10 he's talking about
[18:12] the sacrifice and the high priest and
[18:13] everything and that's that's all true
[18:15] but watch what he says in the book in in
[18:17] in the sixth chapter he says leaving the
[18:20] principles of the doctrine of
[18:22] Christ let's go on to Perfection now we
[18:25] could read that we're not going to take
[18:27] the time to do it but but he says he
[18:29] says doctrine of baptisms you know the
[18:32] doctrine leaving the doctrine of Christ
[18:33] the doctrine of baptism the doctrine of
[18:36] of uh of judgment the doctrine of
[18:39] repentance from dead works we talked all
[18:41] of these doctrines are things that in
[18:43] the message we Embrace these as being
[18:45] very important and they are
[18:47] important but Paul is saying that all of
[18:51] these things that we have have a result
[18:56] am and that's what this me message is
[18:59] focused on this message I've I've shared
[19:03] it several times on this trip even this
[19:06] message didn't come to teach us to
[19:08] evangelize right because we had
[19:12] evangelism the message didn't
[19:14] necessarily even come to establish
[19:16] doctrines it came to establish what the
[19:18] correct Doctrine
[19:20] was you know I mean that was all
[19:23] necessary but I tell you what a million
[19:26] years from now brother Chad and I are
[19:28] going to be walking in new heavens and
[19:29] new
[19:30] earth and we're never going to talk
[19:32] about serpent
[19:33] seed we're not going to talk about we're
[19:36] not going to talk about eternal security
[19:39] you know we're not going to talk about
[19:41] doctrines and things and and and I'll be
[19:43] a little bit bold with this but we're
[19:45] not even going to be talking about the
[19:47] crucifixion of
[19:49] Christ because we're going to be living
[19:52] in a life where sin never happened yeah
[19:56] and so when you when you look and and
[19:58] and you view do the book of Hebrews in
[20:00] this way then it it makes the book of
[20:03] Hebrews different because that's what
[20:06] Paul's really doing here he's not
[20:08] dealing with the Christ that died on
[20:10] Calvary he's dealing with the
[20:12] Resurrection Life he's dealing with the
[20:15] one that came out of the Grave amen okay
[20:17] and so that's what we're looking at here
[20:19] tonight but we're looking at it in a way
[20:22] that I think that it's very timely in
[20:24] the message right now because the
[20:26] message is under a great attack
[20:29] I mean most of you know I mean we've
[20:31] known for years and we've seen the
[20:33] websites and all this stuff and and and
[20:36] I'm tell you what and and I've had good
[20:38] conversation with brother Chad I am not
[20:40] here to address any of that
[20:42] nonsense because I don't care about it
[20:45] my my focus has always been on the
[20:50] attribute you know if if if we're here
[20:53] to answer certain questions about things
[20:56] that you know the things that are
[20:58] brought brought up okay I'll tell you
[21:00] what let me let me share an experience I
[21:02] had years ago I went to
[21:05] Nicaragua and and I have this uh I have
[21:09] this meeting uh with Min I don't even
[21:12] know I didn't even know they were going
[21:13] to be a ministers meeting but we got
[21:15] there and they have this impromptu
[21:17] ministers meeting and there's like 20 or
[21:20] 30 ministers sitting around this table
[21:22] and so I'm there and of course I'm the
[21:24] I'm the white guy I'm the I'm the
[21:26] American so I'm all knowing
[21:29] and and so they begin to ask questions
[21:32] and things and this one brother stood up
[21:34] and he says and he says D interpreter he
[21:36] didn't speak English but he says brother
[21:38] Stan says what are we going to do about
[21:39] all this false Doctrine that's going on
[21:42] well I didn't know but he's talking he's
[21:44] he's like looking at other brothers at
[21:46] the
[21:48] table and I said I said brother I said
[21:50] the problem is if we sit and we try to
[21:54] figure out some way of dealing with this
[21:56] stuff we're using the same thing to deal
[21:59] with it that caused it yeah I said what
[22:02] we need to do is we need to focus on the
[22:05] attribute of God because the only thing
[22:07] that's going to bring a Unity to the
[22:08] bride is the spirit of Christ it's not
[22:11] going to be I'm on the same page you're
[22:14] on the same page you know what do you
[22:15] believe about this what do you believe
[22:17] about that when I met brother Chad last
[22:20] year I didn't need to ask him what he
[22:22] believed to know that he was my
[22:25] brother because I recognized there was a
[22:28] connection
[22:29] and there's and there's you can't
[22:32] practice that you know it has nothing to
[22:35] do with him meeting my qualifications
[22:37] for a brother it has to do with
[22:40] recognizing something that's a part of
[22:43] that see that's what True Fellowship is
[22:46] it's a blending together so let's get to
[22:49] let's get to our message so what Paul is
[22:51] dealing with here in the in the ninth
[22:53] chapter we're we're Fami you know I
[22:56] don't have any quotes with me tonight in
[22:57] fact I don't have any notes at all I
[22:59] have some things on my heart which way I
[23:01] want to go but but the the we're all
[23:05] familiar with an Old Testament
[23:07] Tabernacle and that's what Paul's
[23:08] dealing with here but the prophet taught
[23:11] us and and which it's not unique to the
[23:13] prophet I think most of Christianity
[23:15] deals with the thought that the Old
[23:18] Testament Tabernacle represented a
[23:21] body okay because you have an outer
[23:23] court and the outer Court the brother
[23:25] brandham talks about was subject to the
[23:28] uh the things that went on around it it
[23:30] would it would rain and and everything
[23:32] would get wet it would be sunny
[23:34] everything would be hot you know and so
[23:35] forth so it was influenced by the
[23:37] outside art so that's your body but on
[23:41] the inside inside this inside this
[23:44] rectangle building there were two rooms
[23:46] and one of them was called a holy place
[23:49] and in that Holy place like what Paul
[23:51] says here we could go back and prove it
[23:53] but Paul lays it out there was to the
[23:55] left there was a golden candlestick all
[23:59] right and straight ahead was a table of
[24:00] incense and to the right was a a table
[24:02] of showbread and then from there there
[24:06] was a a
[24:07] veil right and only once a year could
[24:12] the high priest alone nobody else only
[24:14] the high priest could go in behind that
[24:17] Veil and inside that Veil there was only
[24:19] one thing and it was the Ark of the
[24:20] Covenant with The Mercy Seat over it but
[24:23] in the
[24:24] scripture inside the Ark of the Covenant
[24:27] there were three things there was the
[24:29] tables you know the tables of the
[24:31] Covenant there was the there was the pot
[24:34] of mana and then there was Aaron Rod
[24:37] that budded now in in the illustration
[24:40] of this Tabernacle it being a body the
[24:44] holy place is your spirit the spirit
[24:48] realm right and the holy of holies
[24:51] represents the soul amen so I want you
[24:54] to think about this because this is what
[24:56] makes this message so perfect person
[24:59] Al because these items this body that
[25:03] was
[25:04] represented is not the physical body of
[25:08] Jesus and the reason I'm going to say
[25:10] that is because this body needed to be
[25:14] redeemed amen right everything in there
[25:17] had to be sprinkled with blood that's
[25:19] right amen right but the body of Jesus
[25:22] didn't have to be sprinkled with
[25:25] blood but the body of Christ had to be
[25:28] sprinkled with blood right right and so
[25:32] this is representing something right and
[25:35] it and then we can say okay and here's
[25:37] where it's going to get real personal
[25:40] because we say okay this is the body of
[25:43] Christ we're the body of Christ here no
[25:46] you're the body of Christ that's right
[25:48] you're the body of Christ see the body
[25:51] of Christ brother brandham said and the
[25:53] and and there's things in the message
[25:55] that brother brandham says and we and we
[25:56] kind of regulate it to this
[25:58] and everything but then something begins
[26:01] to come into view and brother brandom
[26:03] said that he doesn't deal he deals with
[26:06] Israel as a nation but he deals with the
[26:09] Gentile as individuals amen and so what
[26:12] I want us to get to tonight is that this
[26:17] message didn't come for the
[26:20] bride this message came for
[26:23] me right this message came for me and so
[26:28] so what we're going to see here tonight
[26:30] is something I think really interesting
[26:32] because if we're going to look all right
[26:35] the the Old Testament Tabernacle it
[26:39] represented the dwelling place of God
[26:42] Amen all right because that was this
[26:44] place behind this holy of holies nobody
[26:47] could even go there but the high priest
[26:49] he had to First offer an offering for
[26:53] himself and then he had to offer an
[26:55] offering for the people and so God God
[26:58] was so holy he couldn't he couldn't you
[27:01] know he he couldn't be approached and so
[27:04] and so I want us to think about where
[27:07] does God dwell
[27:09] now he got that God dwells in you all
[27:13] right you are the Tabernacle of the
[27:16] living God's Dwelling Place all right
[27:19] when brother brandham talks about
[27:21] stature of perfect man it was his title
[27:22] really sat perfect man the Tabernacle of
[27:25] the living God's Dwelling Place
[27:28] all right I can take we could take if we
[27:30] had a lot of time I could take you and I
[27:32] could prove to you in the scripture in
[27:34] Psalms 132 it says I have chosen
[27:38] Zion as my place of
[27:41] rest that is my habitation forever who's
[27:45] Zion it's the
[27:47] bride and so we occupy a very unique
[27:51] place in the economy of God and that's
[27:54] what makes this message so
[27:56] important okay and so now what we're
[27:59] looking at we're looking at at three
[28:00] articles that are inside of this Ark of
[28:03] the Covenant all right so what what does
[28:06] the Ark of the Covenant ultimately
[28:08] represent it represents you yes right
[28:11] your
[28:12] soul and so we're given Promises to the
[28:16] Overcomer we're given the ability to eat
[28:19] of that of that hidden
[28:21] Mana but I want you to just drop this in
[28:25] I want you to I want you to consider
[28:26] something because we've talked about it
[28:29] several times this this in the last day
[28:32] or two eternal life is living for
[28:35] others and so if we have a a privilege
[28:39] of eating of the Hidden Mana it's not so
[28:42] that we can thump our chest and say we
[28:45] are something it is something that is
[28:48] causing something to happen to us look
[28:51] the the the hidden Mana
[28:54] was brother brandom said that those High
[28:57] PRI the high priest was the only one
[28:58] when he went behind that Veil he could
[29:00] take a a spoonful of that so the the
[29:04] hidden Mana that you have is for
[29:09] others everything that you have is for
[29:11] others but what I want to what I want to
[29:13] look at tonight and and and what I think
[29:15] that is going to help because it
[29:16] certainly helps
[29:18] me and and and all I can do is just
[29:20] share what what my experience is and
[29:24] that's this Aaron Rod the aon's rod that
[29:26] but let's go back to the number the 17th
[29:29] chapter and and let's let's just read
[29:32] this story uh because it's very
[29:35] significant uh to the to to to what's
[29:38] happening in this hour all right because
[29:42] there's a
[29:43] murmuring we're calling this message
[29:45] tonight the Vindication of the
[29:47] priesthood there is a murmuring against
[29:50] this
[29:51] bride amen there's a murmuring against
[29:55] the bride all right and Watch What
[29:57] Happens because there was a murmuring
[29:59] against the priesthood in the book of in
[30:02] the Book of Numbers in in chapter 17 it
[30:05] says in the verse verse and it says and
[30:06] the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak
[30:09] unto the children of Israel and take
[30:10] every one of them take of every one of
[30:12] them a rod according to the house of
[30:15] their fathers and all their princes
[30:17] according to the house of their fathers
[30:18] 12 rods write thou every man's name upon
[30:22] his rod and thou shalt write the Aaron's
[30:24] name upon the rod of of Levi for one rod
[30:28] shall be the head of the House of their
[30:30] fathers and thou shalt lay them up in
[30:32] the Tabernacle of the congregation
[30:35] before the testimony where I will meet
[30:38] you okay so and it shall come to pass
[30:41] that the man's Rod whom I shall choose
[30:44] shall Blossom and I will make to cease
[30:47] from me the murmurings of the children
[30:50] of Israel whereby they murmur against
[30:54] you so I want you to think about this
[30:57] first of all
[30:58] where where where was this Rod placed
[31:02] was placed in the holy of
[31:04] holies right in the Holy place before
[31:07] the testimony of the
[31:09] Lord so there was something in the Holy
[31:14] place that caused that Rod to
[31:17] Bud and that was the life of God I
[31:19] remember I remember I have a young man
[31:21] in my church I say young man he's in his
[31:24] 30s and uh the first time that and I and
[31:28] I challenged my deacons I wanted them to
[31:30] share the word and the one of the first
[31:32] times that he preached he got up and he
[31:34] said you know he said Jesus cursed the
[31:37] Fig
[31:38] Tree you know and he says and I and I
[31:41] was always wondering about that because
[31:44] the Bible clearly says it wasn't the
[31:46] time for
[31:47] figs so why would Jesus curse the Fig
[31:50] Tree if it wasn't time for
[31:52] figs and the and the brother said
[31:54] because a dead almond rod
[31:58] bore life in the presence of the shakina
[32:02] glory that fig tree it didn't matter
[32:04] whether it had was supposed to be have
[32:06] having figs or not it should have borne
[32:08] life in the presence of God and I
[32:11] thought there's a guy that's got a
[32:13] gift amen but anyway he says he says so
[32:17] Moses spake unto the children of Israel
[32:19] every one of their priests priests gave
[32:21] them rods and each Prince one according
[32:24] to the house so forth it came to pass
[32:27] verse eight it that on the tomorrow
[32:28] Moses went into the Tabernacle witness
[32:30] behold the rod of Aaron of the House of
[32:33] of of Levi was budded and brought forth
[32:36] Buds and Blossom and Bloom blossoms and
[32:39] yielded almonds and Moses uh brought out
[32:42] all the rods from before the of the Lord
[32:44] unto all the children of Israel and they
[32:46] looked and every man and took every man
[32:48] as Rod now watch and the Lord said unto
[32:52] Moses bring Aaron's Rod again before the
[32:56] testimony to be be kept for a token
[32:59] against the rebels and thou shalt quite
[33:03] away or take away their murmurings from
[33:06] me that they die
[33:08] not so what did he do with this Rod that
[33:11] budded like if I was
[33:14] Aaron and and God had supernaturally
[33:17] Vindicated me I would put like a giant
[33:22] banner and I would put this I would want
[33:24] this Rod to be shown to everybody
[33:29] but God said hide it in the
[33:32] soul hide it in the soul amen and so
[33:36] that is our Vindication a personal
[33:40] Vindication there is something brother
[33:43] and sister that has happened in this day
[33:46] and and and I'm telling you I've been in
[33:48] the message a long time and I've and I
[33:51] sat under one of the one one of the most
[33:54] powerful teaching Ministries you you had
[33:58] brother Lonnie and I had brother Brown
[34:00] all right and and I mean we had charts
[34:03] we had we had everything he didn't know
[34:06] how to do PowerPoint but but he but we
[34:09] had everything and we're looking at all
[34:12] this stuff on the chart and and we're
[34:14] seeing the church ages you know and and
[34:16] and the timeline and a Rapture and we
[34:18] see all the seals and where they fit in
[34:20] all this stuff and we say yeah we got it
[34:23] we had
[34:25] understanding but I'm sitting here 50
[34:29] years in the message and I'm thinking
[34:32] why am I looking for something to
[34:36] happen what why why is why is the enemy
[34:41] trying to tell me that there's some
[34:44] great thing
[34:48] coming and and and I'm sitting in a
[34:51] congregation my daughter's Church in in
[34:54] Canada and the brother's talking about
[34:56] perfection and all of a sudden the
[34:58] the things struck me not necessarily
[35:00] something he was saying but just the
[35:03] atmosphere and and and you know what
[35:06] since I've been Pastor for 17 years I
[35:08] have preached so many times on the
[35:10] taking of the
[35:12] book and then I
[35:14] realize the great thing that happened
[35:16] was this event right The Taking of the
[35:19] book that's right and and it's not just
[35:23] something that that here's where the
[35:25] difference is it's not just something
[35:27] something that the prophet brought that
[35:29] he brought that he shed light on the
[35:31] scripture this is something that's real
[35:34] that happened to each one of us it must
[35:38] happen to each one of us there must be
[35:41] something that happens to us that
[35:43] changes our
[35:44] perspective I sharing with brother Chad
[35:46] last night you know I got I'm kind of
[35:49] like a out of the boox kind of a
[35:51] thinker you know I'm not you know I'll
[35:54] tell you what there's a scripture Jesus
[35:56] says if your I be single your whole body
[35:58] is full of light and I studied that out
[36:01] and and not that it comes from study but
[36:03] you know what that word single means it
[36:05] means if you will approach the word
[36:08] without a preconceived idea your whole
[36:11] body will be full of light that's right
[36:13] amen because what happens is is is we
[36:16] get preconceived ideas and it limits us
[36:21] to what God wants to do for us because
[36:25] you know I heard I heard a brother say
[36:27] one time and it's so very true I might
[36:29] have read it in a book or something he
[36:30] says we hear the thing we hear things
[36:32] the way we are yeah so we got a certain
[36:35] idea you know I I've I've preached in
[36:38] churches and and and somebody will come
[36:41] up after I preached and they'll say oh
[36:44] man I've been thinking about all those
[36:46] things oh that what you were saying and
[36:48] I know that there's no way that they
[36:50] were thinking about what I was talking
[36:51] about but they
[36:53] heard the way they were yeah and they
[36:57] interpreted the things that I said by
[36:59] their own experience am well see
[37:02] Revelation is something greater than
[37:04] that right because I I I I'd have the
[37:07] quote on my my tablet in the back but I
[37:09] but I'll just tell you what the prophet
[37:11] said he said that in the message word
[37:14] made flesh in 1954 and he's talking
[37:16] about Revelation he in that message all
[37:20] right brother brandham is like for 45
[37:23] minutes he's talking about his
[37:24] experience in India you know and how how
[37:27] was so poor and you know and the things
[37:29] that he went through there and so forth
[37:31] and then he gets 45 minutes into the
[37:33] message and he says oh well Le's let's
[37:35] just open the Bible and he preaches one
[37:38] of the most powerful messages on
[37:40] Revelation that I've heard and
[37:43] Revelation is Faith of course and so he
[37:46] says in there he says he says Revelation
[37:50] he says as far as the human mind can go
[37:54] is back to the beginning because the
[37:56] text that he used was was uh in the
[37:58] beginning was the word the word was with
[38:00] God and the Word was God and he says as
[38:02] far as your human mind can go as far as
[38:05] theology can go is back to the beginning
[38:09] when there is a
[38:10] word because your human mind needs a
[38:14] word right and so I'll use the example I
[38:17] use the example all the time I said I'll
[38:19] say the word
[38:21] cat all right so what do you what what
[38:24] are you thinking
[38:26] about you know you have you when I say
[38:28] the word cat you're going to think oh
[38:32] he's talking about you know that little
[38:34] Aly cat or he's talking about my little
[38:37] tabby cat or whatever that I have at
[38:38] home or he's talking about this or that
[38:41] but you know what I'm talking about a
[38:42] Caterpillar
[38:45] tractor and maybe there's a few of you
[38:48] brothers that may have thought that but
[38:50] but the only way that you can interpret
[38:53] my word is to have my thought and so the
[38:57] prophet said as far as our human mind
[38:59] can go is back to the beginning but he
[39:02] said Revelation takes us back before the
[39:06] beginning before there was a word that's
[39:09] where Revelation comes from because the
[39:12] thought we have to have the thought to
[39:14] know what the word is and so so you know
[39:19] in the message we got 1100 1200 messages
[39:22] and we've done the same thing with those
[39:24] messages that we did with the Bible
[39:26] there last count I had a I had to do a I
[39:29] did a thing for our local College on
[39:32] compar they wanted to me to do a a
[39:34] speech about brother brandom and about
[39:36] the message and because they a
[39:38] comparative religion class so I did
[39:40] research and this has probably been 10
[39:42] 10 years ago at least H I don't remember
[39:44] how long it's been a long time there
[39:46] were 40,000
[39:49] denominations at that
[39:51] time but you know what there's probably
[39:53] a thousand different
[39:55] message interpretation
[39:58] because we did the same thing with the
[40:00] prophet's message that we did with the
[40:02] Bible and we thought well now we have
[40:04] the the correct word but what we have in
[40:07] the prophet's message are words amen and
[40:11] if we don't have revelation we don't
[40:13] know what those words
[40:15] mean right and so and so this great
[40:18] thing that happened all right brother
[40:21] brandom says in the breach and I
[40:23] probably other than Christ The Mystery
[40:25] of God revealed I probably listen to the
[40:27] breach prach more than any of the other
[40:28] ones I know I've listened to the breach
[40:31] more than any other Seal's messages
[40:33] brother brandom says that the taking of
[40:36] the book was the most Sublime act in the
[40:40] scripture all right so wow you're
[40:42] talking about something that's greater
[40:43] than the
[40:45] cross okay when you think about when you
[40:48] think about what's at stake in this book
[40:50] and that's what we're going to
[40:50] illustrate here tonight because I want
[40:53] we have to have and we have it in our
[40:56] soul but we have to have an Aaron's Rod
[40:59] that buds that takes away not just the
[41:03] attack of the message cuz that that's
[41:05] fruitless anyway but we got some
[41:07] murmuring that goes on right here you
[41:10] know it's it's I can't I was in the
[41:12] Philippines in in in
[41:15] September and and it surprised
[41:19] me how many people were looking for
[41:22] Camala Harris to become the president of
[41:24] the United
[41:25] States as if that was going to be
[41:28] something that Vindicated the message
[41:29] after all these years right right and it
[41:32] and it disturbs me yeah it's 60 years
[41:36] after the prophets off the scene we're
[41:38] still looking for a Vindication of the
[41:40] message right I mean that disturbs me
[41:43] that explains why there's an attack on
[41:45] the
[41:46] message that's why that attack has
[41:49] substance is because people are not
[41:53] engaged in the word they've never
[41:55] experienced the message that's message
[41:57] yourself and what has happened and so so
[42:01] we see this scripture and it says that
[42:04] that this this Aaron's rod in the in the
[42:07] before the testimony is going to be a
[42:09] token against the rebels and it's going
[42:12] to take away the murmurings from
[42:16] me it's going to take away all the
[42:20] question about it I remember years ago
[42:23] when the when the attack and I don't
[42:24] want to really even deal with this
[42:26] because we got something a lot better to
[42:27] look at but I'm going to say I'm going
[42:29] to say one thing about it years ago when
[42:32] I had a brother in the church and he
[42:33] says hey man he says have you seen that
[42:35] believe the sign website and I said well
[42:38] I've seen it before you know I mean I
[42:40] knew that it was supposed to be
[42:42] something good he says well he says
[42:44] they're really they're they're attacking
[42:46] the message now and so I went and looked
[42:48] at it and there was a there was a
[42:50] article on there called Humble Pie and
[42:54] in there they were talking about brother
[42:56] brandom and how did he have a gift and
[42:58] did was he a good man they don't believe
[43:00] that anymore but he did they did at that
[43:02] time they study the message more than we
[43:05] do you know because they're looking for
[43:08] you know something that he said that was
[43:10] wrong or whatever but anyway he so so
[43:14] then I'm reading the article and then he
[43:15] says you know we believe he was a good
[43:17] man all this stuff but he says was he
[43:19] the prophet of Malachi 4 and they said
[43:21] no so I quit reading the
[43:23] article because the only way that he's
[43:26] the prophet of Malachi 4 is if you have
[43:28] your heart turned right and if your
[43:30] heart's not turned he's not the
[43:32] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 right but and
[43:35] so to my church the way I've dealt with
[43:38] the attack on the message is I don't
[43:40] care what they
[43:42] say because there's nothing that's going
[43:46] to change the fact that the message of
[43:48] William brandham opened this word to
[43:51] me I can't take that
[43:54] away but it's it's more than a doctrinal
[43:59] understanding okay so so what we're
[44:01] going to see here let's go to
[44:03] Revelations the 5ifth chapter one of my
[44:07] probably favorite chapters uh in the in
[44:10] the Bible and we're going to see when
[44:13] you look at and it's very very very
[44:15] interesting all right because in this in
[44:18] this Old Testament Tabernacle all right
[44:20] you have around the Tabernacle you have
[44:24] 12 tribes of Israel amen right you have
[44:28] and and then you know to the East and I
[44:31] I didn't refresh myself but to the east
[44:32] you have certain ones and to the South
[44:34] and the west and the North and so forth
[44:36] you have three tribes but the head tribe
[44:40] that's the closest to the Tabernacle are
[44:43] the same symbols of the four living
[44:45] creatures right so in the in the in the
[44:50] in Revelations the 4th chapter you see
[44:53] the Throne of God that's right and its
[44:56] Flame by living
[44:58] creatures the same as in the Old
[45:01] Testament so really what you're seeing
[45:03] in the fourth and fifth chapter is the
[45:06] same thing that we see in the Old
[45:09] Testament
[45:10] Tabernacle and you can go even further
[45:13] than that because even as as
[45:18] Christians with a human
[45:20] influence we're looking at new Heavens
[45:23] new Earth but that that's like way out
[45:26] here even though Hebrews 12 says we've
[45:28] already come to that City but we look at
[45:31] it being way out here but do you know
[45:35] that the new the that the new heavens
[45:37] and new earth that city is also
[45:41] flanked by the 12 tribes of Israel and
[45:44] it's flanked by the 12 apostles so you
[45:48] have the 24 Elders here that's in the
[45:50] fourth chapter and you have a new city
[45:53] that's got 24 Elders around the throne
[45:57] right you see so I want you to catch the
[46:00] connection that's right that God is
[46:03] speaking to us in
[46:05] Parables but it always is a
[46:08] representation of a truth that's
[46:10] underneath that that's right and so the
[46:12] truth I'm going to tell you I'll go
[46:14] right to the punchline the truth of
[46:16] what's underneath that is the theophany
[46:19] body of
[46:21] Christ because that is the logos that
[46:25] God was amen that's the logos that God
[46:29] is all right you know the prophet said
[46:33] and we and we look at it and we can
[46:35] prove it in the scripture I mean the the
[46:37] the Epistles of Paul are all full of it
[46:39] the prophet said God has no voice but
[46:41] your voice right he has no hands but
[46:45] your
[46:46] hands so when did that
[46:49] happen when did it when did it happen
[46:52] did did God not really need a bride
[46:57] but then all of a sudden at the end time
[46:59] now he has a bride so now he's going to
[47:01] use her as his voice or maybe there's
[47:05] something more powerful and important
[47:07] that's happened in this day because
[47:09] because of the Fall the voice of God
[47:13] fell in the
[47:15] fall
[47:17] whoa complete silence but you know what
[47:20] that's the
[47:21] truth because what is the sub the
[47:24] subject of redemption was the bride yeah
[47:27] right yeah right he he he bought the
[47:30] whole field so that he could get the
[47:33] treasure that was in the
[47:35] field because when you look if if we're
[47:40] the voice of God now which we are the
[47:43] Prophet The Prophet was the voice of God
[47:45] everybody says amen but he was the first
[47:48] fruits of what the bride is so we are
[47:51] the voice of God right and so but we
[47:54] have we have in our Tim minded thinking
[47:58] we have an idea that this is something
[47:59] established at the end but what makes
[48:02] this so important Jesus said I'm the
[48:04] vine you're the branches all right when
[48:06] did you become the branches of the tree
[48:08] of life you were always the branches of
[48:12] the Tree of Life when God come down and
[48:16] he walked with Adam you were part of God
[48:21] that walked with Adam you're not not you
[48:25] individually not not Chad Lamb not Stan
[48:28] price but the word that we are is the
[48:32] word that was there it was the word that
[48:35] walked with Adam it was the voice God
[48:37] used to fellowship with
[48:40] Adam and if God has lost that voice
[48:43] because of the Fall which I'm going to
[48:45] show you in a minute if God has lost
[48:48] that voice then nothing can come to its
[48:52] Redemption until the bride puts into
[48:55] steps into her place
[48:57] that's the truth that's the importance
[49:00] of this messag amen all right and we're
[49:02] going to we're going to prove it so we
[49:03] see Revelations the fourth chapter
[49:05] John's caught up there's something
[49:07] interesting here because in the fourth
[49:09] chapter it says after this I looked and
[49:10] behold a door was open in heaven the
[49:12] first voice which I heard was out of a
[49:14] of a trumpet talking with me which said
[49:16] come up hither and I will show thee
[49:18] things which must be Hereafter so the
[49:20] prophet said that Revelations 4 and
[49:22] verse1 was a
[49:24] Rapture right so so how do we even see
[49:28] anything in the seals without taking a
[49:31] Rapture amise God so maybe we're in a
[49:34] Rapture
[49:36] now but it's not a physical catching
[49:39] away but it's stepping into a spiritual
[49:44] condition because the Rapture I'm
[49:47] telling you all right you know there was
[49:51] hardly a day that went by that I didn't
[49:53] say I can't wait to get out of here all
[49:56] right cuz that was my perspective that's
[49:58] right man you know this message has come
[50:00] to rescue me and to take me away from
[50:03] this so that the devil can't harm harm
[50:06] me that's not what this message came to
[50:08] do at allise this message came to
[50:11] positionally place you with the
[50:14] authority to take control of the world
[50:19] Amen because the world belongs to
[50:22] God he P he redeemed it he it it all
[50:25] belongs to him amen and so anyway so we
[50:28] see in this fourth chapter that
[50:30] something has to happen to us for us to
[50:32] even step into the reality of what John
[50:36] is looking at here praise God all right
[50:39] so so that has to happen so we see the
[50:41] we see the true you know and even Paul
[50:43] deals with the living creatures he said
[50:46] the he said cherubim's over The Mercy
[50:48] Seat of which we can't now speak
[50:51] particularly because it wasn't Paul's
[50:53] portion to lay out the first four SE
[50:56] seals for a church age because that's
[50:59] what the first that's what the living
[51:00] creatures were they were guards of the
[51:02] throne that's right so where's the
[51:04] throne amen
[51:06] you right so we see the reality here
[51:10] coming into view because of this message
[51:13] amen right but it's got to be something
[51:16] personal it's got to be something real
[51:19] you know I stood in I was in Pakistan a
[51:21] month or two ago and I said I got a
[51:24] revelation I know how many people's
[51:26] going in the
[51:28] Rapture yeah I do there's only
[51:32] one
[51:34] Christ Christ is the only one going in
[51:36] the Rapture prise the Lord amen you know
[51:39] I told my church at home I said how many
[51:40] people have to be in the Rapture for you
[51:42] to feel comfortable that you're one of
[51:46] them you know it have to be a million
[51:49] people oh yeah you know there's I'm as
[51:52] good at least at the top
[51:55] million what if there there's only five
[51:57] you know you know brother Chad there's a
[51:59] there's a quote nobody ever says one
[52:01] from Indiana one from Georgia one from
[52:04] amen you know in the message straight As
[52:07] the gate two times brother pram says I
[52:09] doubt a dozen people from this this
[52:12] generation meets goes into
[52:15] Rapture and so is there a dozen going I
[52:18] don't believe that's what he was saying
[52:21] but what if there's a dozen going are
[52:23] you one of
[52:24] them we have to have have something more
[52:28] than just a personal knowledge we have
[52:31] to have something that testifies inside
[52:34] of us amen so that's what this message
[52:37] came to do let's get to the let's get to
[52:39] the to the first verse of chapter 5 and
[52:41] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[52:44] on the throne a book written within and
[52:46] on the backside sealed with Seven Seals
[52:48] now I I stole a check I borrowed didn't
[52:50] steal it Seven Seals book out of the
[52:53] office back there so this is going to be
[52:55] the Throne of God
[52:57] and this seven sealed book all right
[53:00] what is this
[53:01] book this book is you amen right oh well
[53:05] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[53:07] it's what I just got through
[53:09] saying because this book is you because
[53:12] I can tell you we call it a book of
[53:14] redemption because in the ninth verse it
[53:18] says and they sung a new song saying now
[53:20] are worthy to take the book and open the
[53:22] seals thereof now wait a minute now when
[53:24] when Jesus when the lamb takes the book
[53:27] why didn't Jesus say wow praise God now
[53:31] they're all going to know who I
[53:33] am but it was the
[53:36] bride and we'll get to this in a minute
[53:38] but they saying in verse 10 says and
[53:40] Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[53:43] of every kingom and and has made us unto
[53:47] our God Kings and Priests and we shall
[53:51] reign on the earth so something happens
[53:55] when the lamb takes this book
[53:57] all right so I want you to see this
[53:59] seven sealed book is in the hand of him
[54:02] that sits on the
[54:04] throne so where are
[54:07] you before the lamb even came to redeem
[54:11] you right where were
[54:15] you okay so here's here's something
[54:18] we're talking about last night because I
[54:20] I I I didn't understand why brother
[54:23] brandham said that Adam had this book
[54:27] cuz that's what he said yeah he said
[54:29] Adam had this book but when Adam fell
[54:31] this book went back to the throne amen
[54:35] but see Adam had a
[54:37] commission all right how did Jesus come
[54:40] on the
[54:41] earth he was born of a virgin amen why
[54:44] didn't Jesus just appear on the scene
[54:49] yeah because he had to undo the Fall by
[54:54] coming the way we were always supposed
[54:57] to come and that's by Spoken Word
[55:01] through the womb of Adam's race amen God
[55:05] was going to multiply himself and make
[55:08] himself have a connection with mankind
[55:12] Amen in a way that would make him the
[55:17] priest but when Adam sinned the Virgin
[55:20] womb became
[55:23] corrupt right amen because now there was
[55:26] no spoken word there was not there was
[55:29] now there was the the result of sex and
[55:34] lust and so that's but Jesus came and
[55:37] undid it all but when man fell that book
[55:41] went back to its original owner amen
[55:45] praise God and Adam who had originally
[55:47] been commissioned to bring forth a bride
[55:51] on the Earth right right could not do it
[55:54] that's right so Jesus Jesus had to
[55:57] come and and and take care of this
[56:00] Redemption now watch what he says and I
[56:02] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[56:05] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[56:07] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[56:10] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[56:13] under the Earth was able to open the
[56:16] book neither to look
[56:19] thereon
[56:21] wow and he said and I wept much because
[56:25] no man was found wor worthy to open the
[56:27] book and read the book to open and read
[56:29] the book and either to look there on so
[56:32] the prophet said in the message the
[56:34] breach why did John cry right because if
[56:40] the if nobody could open that book see
[56:43] the book is there yeah amen but it's not
[56:47] opened right we're not talking here
[56:50] about doctrines under the
[56:52] seals we're talking about a people amen
[56:56] we're talking about the manifestation of
[56:59] a people that is the Tree of Life to all
[57:04] creation and if that book is not made
[57:08] manifest right then where's Adam going
[57:10] to go yeah Adam Adam's redeemed but
[57:14] where's he going to go that's right why
[57:17] is why does Romans 8 say that all
[57:19] creation is groaning and travailing
[57:22] waiting for you to come to your position
[57:25] because if you don't come to your
[57:27] position they are lost yeah that's right
[57:31] amen there must be an intercessor amen
[57:35] there must be a way for the grace of God
[57:39] to flow amise God you say well Jesus
[57:43] took care of that on the cross
[57:44] absolutely he did so why are we looking
[57:48] at an event that if that book isn't open
[57:51] everything's lost that's right because
[57:54] this is the result
[57:56] yeah of what happened on the cross this
[57:59] is what was required to happen that
[58:02] Jesus died for so that that book could
[58:05] be open am and so here we see watch this
[58:08] so he said and one of the elders said
[58:11] unto me weep not I can hear brother
[58:14] brandom saying and his crying didn't
[58:16] last
[58:18] long and he said weep not Behold The
[58:22] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[58:25] David has prevailed to open the book and
[58:27] loose the Seven Seals
[58:29] thereof so John who knows the Bible and
[58:35] the lion of the tribe of Judah is God
[58:39] yeah amen so he
[58:43] turns expecting to see God and he sees a
[58:47] lamb amen right he sees an
[58:51] office of God Amen I want to I want to
[58:55] be very careful I want you to understand
[58:58] that I'm not doing away with the person
[59:00] of Jesus because all that God was was
[59:03] poured into Jesus am but then all that
[59:07] Christ was is poured into the church
[59:09] amen I'm not doing away with Jesus but I
[59:12] want us to understand something that I'm
[59:15] I'm going to get really bold here if
[59:19] there had not been a fall Jesus would
[59:21] not have
[59:23] come because Jesus came for
[59:27] Redemption and if there's nothing to be
[59:29] redeemed there would not have been an
[59:32] office work of
[59:34] redemption right right so what John has
[59:38] done was doing was he was looking and he
[59:42] was expecting to see God who was all in
[59:45] all he was expecting to see the fullness
[59:48] of God claiming that book but it wasn't
[59:52] it was an office
[59:53] work because Redemption had to happen
[59:57] amen look and this has helped me so much
[1:00:01] I was talking with brother Chad last
[1:00:02] night I hope I got the Liberty to to say
[1:00:05] it but but I did not all right I didn't
[1:00:09] understand there was something the
[1:00:10] prophet said that it's amazing to think
[1:00:13] that there's something the prophet said
[1:00:15] we didn't
[1:00:16] understand but he said he said you can
[1:00:21] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:00:24] hour of your life and be lost yes true
[1:00:28] and I thought whoa and he says and the
[1:00:29] Bible says that yeah I thought wow I
[1:00:34] never heard that I never read that
[1:00:36] scripture and so I'm I'm I'm like asking
[1:00:39] the Lord I said what does this mean well
[1:00:42] brother brandom explains it in false
[1:00:43] anointed
[1:00:44] ones okay but I want you to think about
[1:00:47] something when God would walk with Adam
[1:00:51] I don't want my time to get away when
[1:00:52] God would walk with Adam what was he
[1:00:57] was he a God that was above us no was he
[1:01:02] a God that was with
[1:01:05] us not the way Christ was because he did
[1:01:08] not walk with Adam in
[1:01:10] Redemption because Adam didn't need to
[1:01:12] be
[1:01:13] redeemed was he was he the God in us no
[1:01:18] so he was walking with Adam and I'm
[1:01:21] going to use a term that we're going to
[1:01:23] talk about later but he was God who was
[1:01:25] all all in all because the Garden of
[1:01:28] Eden was God's full desire in seed form
[1:01:33] that's right amen it was the
[1:01:36] beginning it was the thing that God
[1:01:38] looked at and said this is very good
[1:01:41] right and so that was God in a fullness
[1:01:46] in the form of a word in the form of
[1:01:48] logos walking with man but when man
[1:01:52] sinned then he became God above us yeah
[1:01:56] right so if there was no sin there would
[1:01:58] not be an office work of God above us
[1:02:01] yeah right amen if there had and then so
[1:02:04] then the objective of the Plan of
[1:02:07] Redemption came that God needed to
[1:02:09] redeem
[1:02:10] man which was accomplished at Calvary
[1:02:14] right when Jesus bowed his head and he
[1:02:16] said it is finished it was finished
[1:02:18] there's not one single thing that needs
[1:02:21] to
[1:02:21] happen Christ has paid completely and
[1:02:25] totally the price for our Redemption now
[1:02:28] Redemption is not forgiveness of
[1:02:30] sins although that's a quality of it
[1:02:33] Redemption is restoration amen so he has
[1:02:37] made a way for us to go back to our
[1:02:40] original
[1:02:41] condition right but we don't Rec I got a
[1:02:44] quote let me read you mind if I read a
[1:02:46] quote brother and this is one of my
[1:02:48] favorite quotes I got I got and I taped
[1:02:51] these things in my Bible because I love
[1:02:54] them it it'll take me a second to find
[1:02:57] it all right brother brandham said and
[1:02:59] it's the message
[1:03:01] Oneness and brother brandham said now
[1:03:04] the first human beings disfellowship
[1:03:07] themselves from believing God by
[1:03:09] disbelieving his word and listening to
[1:03:11] the LIE of the devil so they
[1:03:13] disfellowshipped themselves all right
[1:03:15] think about this because they had a
[1:03:17] place Adam and Eve had a place of
[1:03:19] fellowship with God but it wasn't in
[1:03:21] their
[1:03:21] Humanity it was in the theophany that
[1:03:24] dwelt in them right because their
[1:03:26] theophany was created in the image of
[1:03:29] God so that was the only part you know
[1:03:32] outside and the prophet says it Adam's
[1:03:35] flesh was
[1:03:36] animal So Adam Adam's fellowship with
[1:03:40] God was not based on his flesh it was
[1:03:43] based on the this harmonious part that
[1:03:46] God had put in that flesh which was the
[1:03:48] theophany that was made in His image
[1:03:51] right and so here is Adam and Eve in
[1:03:55] harmony with with God yet they're in
[1:03:58] flesh all right so watch so so now
[1:04:01] that's the first thing that dis
[1:04:02] Fellowship this wonderful Union but now
[1:04:05] look Adam and Eve in a position to never
[1:04:09] die because that's that was the position
[1:04:12] they were in a position to never die in
[1:04:15] a position to never be
[1:04:17] old right in a position to never be sick
[1:04:22] to never have a
[1:04:23] worry and you say I sure wish I could be
[1:04:26] like
[1:04:28] that well let me I got news for you you
[1:04:31] are in the same
[1:04:35] position Redemption has done a work that
[1:04:37] we don't even recognize and so what so
[1:04:41] what has happened here okay Christ has
[1:04:44] redeemed
[1:04:46] us but we have not been made
[1:04:49] manifest we don't because I came onto
[1:04:52] this Earth and I have a gene of God in
[1:04:54] Me God amen that Gene of God listen to
[1:04:59] this is already
[1:05:01] there sitting there but I don't know who
[1:05:04] I am right right right I come into this
[1:05:07] world ignorant right not knowing who I
[1:05:09] am but Watch What Happens okay so he
[1:05:12] says I I beheld and I looked in low
[1:05:15] verse six in the midst of the Throne of
[1:05:17] the four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:05:19] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:05:21] having seven Harps seven eyes which are
[1:05:24] the seven spirits of Gods sent forth
[1:05:26] into all the Earth we could stop on this
[1:05:28] but we're not going to and he came and
[1:05:30] he took the book out of the hand to him
[1:05:34] that sat on the throne so this book The
[1:05:38] Lamb where did the lamb come from he
[1:05:41] came out of the throne amen but he was
[1:05:44] not a separate person from the one that
[1:05:46] was sitting this is a
[1:05:48] parable it's a parable It's a drama that
[1:05:51] God is playing out because I want you to
[1:05:53] see that this is where you
[1:05:56] live the The Throne of God is in
[1:05:59] you and so what God is showing you is
[1:06:03] what Redemption did for you
[1:06:07] individually God and so the lamb what
[1:06:11] did he do he claimed
[1:06:14] you but you know what the prophet said
[1:06:16] I'm and I'm fixing to show you what the
[1:06:19] prophet said he sat back down on the
[1:06:23] throne so what happened
[1:06:26] redemption's work had been
[1:06:29] accomplished because he opened he was
[1:06:33] the only one that could open this book
[1:06:35] that's right and so now he is in the
[1:06:38] throne yeah
[1:06:41] revealing who you
[1:06:44] [Applause]
[1:06:47] are and and so and so watch so watch and
[1:06:52] when verse eight and when he had taken
[1:06:54] the book the four beasts and the 4 and
[1:06:56] 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:06:58] having every one of them Harps golden
[1:07:00] vials full of odors which are the
[1:07:02] prayers of the Saints and they sung a
[1:07:04] new song okay who is
[1:07:08] singing It's not the it's not the 24
[1:07:11] Elders it's not the four beasts but it's
[1:07:14] the prayers of the
[1:07:16] Saints and the and I tell you what when
[1:07:19] brother Brandon preached the questions
[1:07:20] and answers on the seals and I love this
[1:07:22] because we we watch you know we're
[1:07:25] message Believers all right and if
[1:07:27] you're going to sit here and you're
[1:07:28] going to say that every word that came
[1:07:30] out of brother Brandon's mouth was thus
[1:07:31] sayeth the Lord then you're not
[1:07:32] listening to the same message I
[1:07:34] heard because brother brandom said 700
[1:07:37] when he meant 7,000 he said Mary when he
[1:07:40] met Eve or he said 2 Thessalonians when
[1:07:42] he means first Thessalonians you know
[1:07:44] and some people are like oh did he did
[1:07:46] they change the Bible you know because
[1:07:48] the prophet said that the Rapture was in
[1:07:50] second Thessalonians the 4th chapter but
[1:07:52] it's in the first you know
[1:07:55] so so why was it so important because
[1:08:00] when brother Brandon preached question
[1:08:01] and answer on the seals he was asking a
[1:08:03] question they asked him a question
[1:08:06] somebody said is this group of people
[1:08:08] that sing this song I don't remember the
[1:08:10] exact word of but is this group of
[1:08:12] people is this the Rapture of
[1:08:15] saints and brother brand says no it's
[1:08:18] not and he just goes on to the next
[1:08:20] question and starts reading the next
[1:08:23] question and all of a sudden brother
[1:08:25] random saying is there something wrong
[1:08:28] here is there is there somebody sick and
[1:08:32] somebody from the audience calls out
[1:08:33] says read the scripture read the
[1:08:35] scripture again am and so brother
[1:08:38] Brandon now why didn't the Holy Spirit
[1:08:40] stop the meeting when he said 700 not
[1:08:43] 7,000 amen because I believe the Lord
[1:08:47] was drawing our attention to who it is
[1:08:51] that's in this
[1:08:54] verse so what is this song Oh this is so
[1:08:57] good this is another whole message
[1:08:59] brother Chad but third poll is a prayer
[1:09:04] praise right and so positional placing
[1:09:07] of the Bride changes our
[1:09:12] prayer all right I'm hey I'm with you
[1:09:16] I've been I've been a Christian a long
[1:09:17] time been in the message and I'm praying
[1:09:21] uh sister Jones needs a healing God will
[1:09:26] you somewhere out there he's somewhere
[1:09:29] out there will will you go and heal
[1:09:33] sister
[1:09:34] Jones I'm done with
[1:09:37] that so sister Jones doesn't get healed
[1:09:40] you say well must not have been God's
[1:09:43] will but the taking of the book puts the
[1:09:48] authority into the
[1:09:50] bride and we say
[1:09:55] they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[1:09:57] Worthy to take the book to open the
[1:09:59] seals thereof for thou was slain and
[1:10:01] Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[1:10:03] of every Kindred people Nation uh people
[1:10:06] and Nation so that proves it's not the
[1:10:08] 24 Elders because 24 Elders are all
[1:10:11] Jewish that's right right so it's a
[1:10:14] people and and
[1:10:18] Hast
[1:10:20] Hast it doesn't say and is going
[1:10:23] to but when the land
[1:10:26] takes the book and reveals the
[1:10:30] contents we recognize what we
[1:10:33] are and you know what even in even in
[1:10:36] our own church different places that you
[1:10:39] go and you preach this and people are
[1:10:42] like Hallelujah brother Stan that is
[1:10:44] great and then Monday
[1:10:47] morning it's back to the old same old
[1:10:50] right but I believe that Revelation has
[1:10:54] an action yes and if you have a
[1:10:58] revelation that you are seated in the
[1:11:01] Throne of God that takes away the
[1:11:04] murmurings that takes away the rebel
[1:11:07] yeah right and you become the voice of
[1:11:11] God to declare his word amen and when
[1:11:15] sister Jones now look you know it's like
[1:11:19] the human part of us which is very much
[1:11:22] still a
[1:11:23] tempter all right although it's dead but
[1:11:26] the enemy still uses this and it's like
[1:11:31] well that guy you know let me out in
[1:11:34] traffic you got eternal
[1:11:36] life you know I mean it's not that at
[1:11:39] all right it's it's now you have the
[1:11:43] mind of Christ that's right all right
[1:11:46] let me ask you a question if you're if
[1:11:50] you are walking through the pool of
[1:11:53] Bethesda and you have
[1:11:56] like healing just pouring off of
[1:11:59] you you're going to walk past everybody
[1:12:03] say oh you're healed oh you're
[1:12:06] healed God can't trust us yep because
[1:12:10] Jesus walked past you know I heard a
[1:12:12] brother preach one time about multitudes
[1:12:15] there could have been thousands of
[1:12:17] people at the pool of
[1:12:19] Bethesda and Jesus walked past every
[1:12:22] single one of them to one man who was
[1:12:24] not even going to
[1:12:26] die because I can only do what the
[1:12:30] father shows me oh God if we had time to
[1:12:33] look at that see because the prophet
[1:12:36] said that Jesus had a vision for
[1:12:38] everything he did all right and it's
[1:12:41] really easy to understand that in the
[1:12:44] light of brother brandom because brother
[1:12:46] brandom had a
[1:12:47] vision but I I I'm sure that there are
[1:12:51] people that are here that have had
[1:12:52] Visions but I have never had a vision
[1:12:55] Vision never that I'm aware of so how do
[1:12:59] I do the will of God by faith because
[1:13:04] faith is my
[1:13:05] vision right faith is something that
[1:13:08] dwelt before sin happened amen amen and
[1:13:12] faith is the testimony of the reality
[1:13:15] that lays below this sinful World
[1:13:19] eternity is still going on right now
[1:13:22] right the reason that you can be healed
[1:13:25] tonight is not oh if I could only
[1:13:28] believe hard enough if you could get a
[1:13:30] faith Vision that you have a new body
[1:13:33] that you're drawing that healing from
[1:13:36] it's over amen right that's what faith
[1:13:39] is Faith is a is a a a vision into the
[1:13:46] Eternal it's faith is so is so real okay
[1:13:50] so let's so let's so let's look at first
[1:13:53] Corin let's look at 1 Corinthians the
[1:13:55] 15th chapter and let's watch
[1:13:58] this because I love this scripture
[1:14:02] because because what we see what we see
[1:14:04] in these office work okay what we call
[1:14:06] it brother Brenham one place I know said
[1:14:08] Office Works the other places he says
[1:14:09] office these are offices of God okay so
[1:14:13] I'm a I'm a I'm a I'm a
[1:14:16] husband uh I'm a father I'm a
[1:14:19] grandfather uh last May I became a
[1:14:23] great-grandfather right and and there's
[1:14:25] nothing I mean it's great but I'm
[1:14:27] married to a great grandmother and
[1:14:29] that's that makes me feel really
[1:14:33] old but all of those Office Works are
[1:14:37] positions that I become in different
[1:14:42] settings but it's not who I am right
[1:14:47] because the
[1:14:48] reality is the life that I am and not
[1:14:53] the office
[1:14:55] did I did I become so here in this
[1:14:59] Redemption and we're going to see this
[1:15:01] in in 1 Corinthians 15 watch
[1:15:03] this because the the the trinitarians
[1:15:07] have a field day with the scripture and
[1:15:09] probably there's people in the message
[1:15:10] that believe there's a father and a son
[1:15:12] and all that and that's fine they can
[1:15:14] believe what they want but it says in
[1:15:16] verse 20 20 uh we'll begin read verse 22
[1:15:20] for as in Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:15:22] shall all be made alive but every man
[1:15:24] after after his own order Christ the
[1:15:26] first fruits afterward they there are
[1:15:27] Christ that is coming then cometh the
[1:15:30] end when he shall have delivered up the
[1:15:34] kingdom even the father Kingdom to God
[1:15:37] even the father when he shall have put
[1:15:39] down all Rule and all authority and
[1:15:43] power what is the
[1:15:45] kingdom you
[1:15:47] amen okay and so when he put down oh
[1:15:51] this is gets really good when he puts
[1:15:54] down all Rule and all authority then he
[1:15:57] sits down yeah on the throne that's
[1:16:00] right right and he opens the book okay
[1:16:04] so now watch watch cuz this I I I get I
[1:16:08] can I can run in place okay so so so
[1:16:12] watch what he says okay so he puts down
[1:16:14] all rule all authority and power for he
[1:16:18] must Reign the intercessory work of
[1:16:21] Christ must Reign till he hath put all
[1:16:25] enemies under his
[1:16:29] feet okay
[1:16:32] watch and The Last Enemy that shall be
[1:16:35] destroyed is
[1:16:37] death
[1:16:39] what is
[1:16:42] preventing all right we're not we're not
[1:16:44] talking about an event that happened in
[1:16:45] 1963 we're not talking about brother
[1:16:47] bandam standing at the pulpit and
[1:16:49] revealing what was in the seals we're
[1:16:51] talking about something personal that
[1:16:52] happens to you yes what is preventing
[1:16:57] you from recognizing your position and
[1:17:02] thus putting all things under the feet
[1:17:05] of God
[1:17:08] Amen that's right what is Romans 8 said
[1:17:11] this is the carnal mind is death yeah
[1:17:16] right so what is preventing God from
[1:17:20] sitting on the throne in his position
[1:17:23] with a voice
[1:17:26] your human
[1:17:28] thinking that's right so the Last Enemy
[1:17:33] oh this is this watch this so The Last
[1:17:35] Enemy that shall be destroyed is death
[1:17:38] for he hath put all things under his
[1:17:40] feet but when he has when he saith all
[1:17:43] things are under him it is Manifest that
[1:17:44] he is accepted which did put all things
[1:17:46] under him and when all things shall be
[1:17:50] subdued unto him meaning death has been
[1:17:52] conquered watch then then shall the son
[1:17:56] also himself be subject unto him that
[1:17:59] put all things under him that God may be
[1:18:03] all in
[1:18:04] all so what are we saying am I doing
[1:18:07] away with Jesus
[1:18:09] no but am I doing a when I say that
[1:18:13] Jesus when he sat down on the throne was
[1:18:17] absorbed back into the office work of
[1:18:21] Jesus as Redeemer went away
[1:18:27] right why because it's not necessary
[1:18:31] anymore right and God has become the god
[1:18:36] who is all in all yeah because his
[1:18:40] voice has been restored amen and now
[1:18:45] Adam can come back to the Tree of
[1:18:49] Life this the fellow the theophany of
[1:18:52] God we call ourselves the body of Christ
[1:18:56] what does that mean does that mean a
[1:18:58] body of water what's it mean the body of
[1:19:02] Christ is a theophany logos
[1:19:05] body and what I see and and I'm telling
[1:19:08] you and and I know this I know this
[1:19:10] message goes out I don't know
[1:19:14] where but I'm telling
[1:19:17] you that all right the prophet said God
[1:19:21] is not complete without you amen amen
[1:19:25] and so this is so important to the
[1:19:29] economy of God for the bride to take her
[1:19:34] position and now let's let's bring this
[1:19:37] let's bring this to to a a a conclusion
[1:19:41] here in 2 Corinthians the 3r
[1:19:45] chapter okay because what we're looking
[1:19:47] at here is we're looking at we're
[1:19:51] looking at an event that's a drama okay
[1:19:54] and we see a lot of things that are all
[1:19:57] wrapped up in this dramatic event
[1:20:00] because really what happens is the
[1:20:03] reality is when Christ died on the cross
[1:20:05] he he finished this whole work right
[1:20:08] right but we see in the end time we see
[1:20:11] something that has to happen the reality
[1:20:14] has to be made known because now there's
[1:20:16] a living bride that's all been
[1:20:18] represented all been manifested for
[1:20:20] seven Church ages and so now it's come
[1:20:23] time to to take the position but really
[1:20:27] the work was accomplished that's right
[1:20:29] already and the proof of it is that we
[1:20:33] go back to this Old Testament type right
[1:20:37] and you have the outer CT and the inner
[1:20:39] court and the holy of holies and there
[1:20:41] was a
[1:20:42] veil that was hiding the shakina
[1:20:48] glory so where was that shakina
[1:20:51] Glory it's in you
[1:20:55] there's a gene
[1:20:57] attribute of God that's there that you
[1:21:00] didn't even know right I mean I'm a
[1:21:03] 15-year-old snotty-nosed kid smoking
[1:21:06] cigarettes and doing LSD getting into
[1:21:08] all sorts of trouble getting arrested
[1:21:10] every other week right but I had a gene
[1:21:13] of God in Me you want there's a story
[1:21:17] there's a brother in cander named John L
[1:21:20] Trudeau some of you might know him he's
[1:21:22] a good friend of mine he tells the a
[1:21:25] story about how that when he became a
[1:21:27] Christian he he'd come out of the world
[1:21:30] he was a drug Pusher and all this stuff
[1:21:32] I don't remember I mean but he was bad
[1:21:34] guy so he stole money from people he
[1:21:37] stole stuff and so when he became
[1:21:38] Christian he went about to try to make
[1:21:40] things right which is what a Christian
[1:21:43] should do right there's things that you
[1:21:45] can never make right but you know if you
[1:21:48] have the ability and God puts it on your
[1:21:49] heart you need to go do it right and so
[1:21:53] brother John L
[1:21:55] when he was in the world had stolen some
[1:21:57] tools from a
[1:21:58] man okay and some expensive tools so the
[1:22:02] Lord you know one day brother John wakes
[1:22:04] up and and he and he's like the Lord
[1:22:06] says you need to go return those
[1:22:08] tools and so brother John L says well I
[1:22:12] okay I will Lord you put it on my heart
[1:22:14] I'll take care of he says you need to do
[1:22:15] it
[1:22:16] today and he's like you know well I had
[1:22:19] things to do but you know when God tells
[1:22:21] you to do something you need to do it so
[1:22:24] so he goes to the man's house the man
[1:22:27] was a very angry man and he knocks on
[1:22:30] the door and he hears the man inside
[1:22:32] come in and he was like what do you want
[1:22:35] and he said well he says you I have to
[1:22:38] tell you I've gave my heart to the Lord
[1:22:41] and he says I've been trying to fix
[1:22:42] things that I did wrong when I was in
[1:22:45] the world and and he says I have to tell
[1:22:46] you that I stole those tools from you I
[1:22:49] knew You' stole those tools you know he
[1:22:51] was really brother John leek said I was
[1:22:54] a little nervous about how he was
[1:22:56] responding to me but he said the man
[1:23:00] said and and when he walked into the
[1:23:02] house the man's sitting in a big chair
[1:23:04] and he's got a
[1:23:05] gun you know and so like like John's
[1:23:10] wondering about what he walked into
[1:23:12] anyway the man says I was sitting here
[1:23:14] in the chair and today is the worst day
[1:23:15] of my life because my wife and children
[1:23:18] just walked out of that door and they're
[1:23:20] not coming back and I was sitting here
[1:23:22] about to blow my brains out
[1:23:25] but you
[1:23:26] came and because of what your testimony
[1:23:29] was I'm not going to do
[1:23:31] that so God put it on John L's heart to
[1:23:36] return those tools on that day yeah but
[1:23:39] you know what the story's better than
[1:23:41] that because when John L was a drug
[1:23:44] Pusher and a thief he stole those tools
[1:23:49] so that he could go and return them and
[1:23:52] save that man's life
[1:23:56] so God has been in
[1:23:57] control of everything that we've ever
[1:24:00] done no matter how bad it seems
[1:24:04] everything that we've gone through is
[1:24:06] part of the character that we
[1:24:09] are and so in this scripture that we're
[1:24:12] looking at
[1:24:13] here Paul is talking about uh when Moses
[1:24:17] would go up on the mountain you know and
[1:24:19] he would he would get the word of the
[1:24:21] Lord and he would come back down off the
[1:24:23] mountain and his face would glow and the
[1:24:26] children of Israel were really worried
[1:24:28] about that you know because well I mean
[1:24:31] they'd heard the trumpet sound and they
[1:24:32] didn't want to die and they didn't want
[1:24:33] to see the they just tell us you know
[1:24:36] and so when Moses and the prophets said
[1:24:39] that that after and Moses was God to
[1:24:42] them right until he delivered the word
[1:24:45] and then his face wouldn't glow he'd be
[1:24:46] a man whatever and so we'll pick up the
[1:24:49] story because this really brings this
[1:24:52] aspect of it into our day because we're
[1:24:56] the same as Israel when we're in the
[1:24:58] world we're the same as Israel there's
[1:25:00] no difference and so watch what he
[1:25:03] says he says and we we'll pick up the
[1:25:06] the the context he says in verse 13 not
[1:25:09] as Moses which put a veil over his face
[1:25:11] that the children of Israel could not
[1:25:12] steadfastly look to the end which was
[1:25:14] abolish abolished but their minds were
[1:25:18] blinded for until this day remaineth the
[1:25:22] same Veil untaken away in the reading of
[1:25:25] the Old Testament which Veil is done
[1:25:28] away in Christ so the veil has been done
[1:25:32] away in Christ
[1:25:35] right but even unto this day when Moses
[1:25:39] is read the veil is upon their
[1:25:44] heart so what thinking about unveiling a
[1:25:48] god what does the veil
[1:25:50] hide it's hiding the presence of
[1:25:53] God right
[1:25:54] but see we we in our human mind we can't
[1:25:57] even wrap our minds around what we're
[1:26:00] talking about here tonight what this
[1:26:03] message is about yeah I I brother and
[1:26:06] sister I lay in bed some mornings and
[1:26:07] I'm thinking you're just really cuckoo
[1:26:10] in the
[1:26:11] Gaga you know to believe the things that
[1:26:13] you
[1:26:14] believe but it doesn't have anything to
[1:26:17] do with me it has to do with what the
[1:26:20] word says and that's where the
[1:26:23] vindication
[1:26:25] matters that's something that testifies
[1:26:28] about my position that that I can't
[1:26:32] understand I can't wrap my mind around
[1:26:35] that God has no voice but my voice but
[1:26:39] our voice he has no hands you know I
[1:26:42] remember there was a brother in Haiti
[1:26:44] that was telling me get tell give me a
[1:26:45] testimony he says you know there was a
[1:26:47] brother that he said I was building a
[1:26:50] house and uh he said for me and my wife
[1:26:53] and he says I was shorts of money so
[1:26:56] I've been
[1:26:57] praying all right you know we pray for
[1:27:01] things and then when we don't get it we
[1:27:03] just don't think that we we try to
[1:27:06] because we know what we prayed for is
[1:27:08] our desire and so we go to try to make
[1:27:12] it
[1:27:12] happen when we don't just trust God
[1:27:16] that's right you know you put something
[1:27:17] before the Lord say if if your will we I
[1:27:21] want your will but really when you
[1:27:23] prayed you had a will that you wanted to
[1:27:26] to to see happen and I see it all the
[1:27:28] time you know brother Chad deals with it
[1:27:30] too you know you get people from
[1:27:32] overseas and and they you know they need
[1:27:35] a they need iron sheets for their church
[1:27:38] I hear a lot about that do you hear
[1:27:39] about that brother iron sheets for your
[1:27:41] church well have you prayed well yeah
[1:27:45] then why are you asking
[1:27:47] me because you're trying to make
[1:27:50] something
[1:27:51] happen when you need to just put it
[1:27:53] before for the Lord because I don't know
[1:27:56] about anybody else I know about me that
[1:27:59] sometimes the Lord just put somebody on
[1:28:00] my heart send them some
[1:28:02] money so maybe they were praying you
[1:28:05] know what brother brandom said beautiful
[1:28:07] quote he's in the prayer line and he's
[1:28:10] calling out a brother he says brother he
[1:28:12] says you have a certain certain disease
[1:28:16] he says I heard your prayer in prayer
[1:28:19] land he heard the
[1:28:22] prayer what what was that it was the god
[1:28:27] yeah that was part of
[1:28:29] him you know if if if if we had
[1:28:33] confidence in who the new song of the
[1:28:35] Bride is to send the
[1:28:38] word right amen okay so watch this so
[1:28:41] watch this so he says but even verse 15
[1:28:45] again we'll pick up the context but even
[1:28:48] unto this day when Moses is read the
[1:28:51] veil is upon their heart
[1:28:55] nevertheless when it the heart shall
[1:28:59] turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken
[1:29:04] away so what has happened in this
[1:29:07] message see you're already
[1:29:12] here not in
[1:29:15] 1963 right
[1:29:17] forever you've always been here that's
[1:29:20] right but there's a veil that's right
[1:29:22] amen now that Veil is on your
[1:29:25] soul right but when your heart is turned
[1:29:31] to the
[1:29:32] Lord then the veil is taken away and you
[1:29:36] can see clearly who you are see see it's
[1:29:42] it's it's
[1:29:43] about what I see what I see you know we
[1:29:47] talk the brother brother Brandon says
[1:29:50] now you know before it was a sin to go
[1:29:52] in behind the veil before you because
[1:29:54] you'd be destroyed now now it's it you
[1:29:57] can't not go behind the veil right so
[1:29:59] the veil is taken away and so we think
[1:30:02] okay now I can see what's in behind the
[1:30:04] veil but what's in behind the veil is
[1:30:07] inside of you am right but the the
[1:30:11] secret of this message is now what's in
[1:30:15] here can come out amen that's the bride
[1:30:20] position sir the branches of the Tree of
[1:30:23] Life
[1:30:24] the ministering life to
[1:30:27] Adam I was talking to brother Chad last
[1:30:30] night and I was so brother I wanted to
[1:30:32] do
[1:30:34] backflips because when you talked about
[1:30:37] Adam having Perpetual life I have
[1:30:39] believed that for all along I've never
[1:30:43] heard anybody say that because Adam's
[1:30:48] life depended on his fellowship with God
[1:30:51] and that's what you see a new jerus
[1:30:54] Jem a New Jerusalem it can we can have a
[1:30:58] literal City okay that's great but I
[1:31:01] tell you I tell you I just be let me
[1:31:03] just be frank and you be Earnest all
[1:31:07] right I built a house 5 years ago and
[1:31:11] and I mean like we had this floor plan
[1:31:13] and this is like and my wife is picking
[1:31:15] out things and we're doing all this
[1:31:17] stuff and we've been there 5 years and
[1:31:19] now we're ready to renovate it
[1:31:24] so if you can think of the most
[1:31:27] wonderful uh
[1:31:29] magnificent kind of a building that you
[1:31:31] would
[1:31:33] want million
[1:31:37] years can we change out some of these
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:41] pictures because it's not about a
[1:31:44] physical City that's right it's about a
[1:31:48] people when that City dropped on the
[1:31:50] earth the Bible says the Tabernacle of
[1:31:55] God is with
[1:31:57] men so what do we see in in Revelations
[1:32:01] 21 and 22 we see the Fulfillment of the
[1:32:05] Garden of Eden
[1:32:07] restored 13 times in Christ The Mystery
[1:32:11] of God revealed brother brandham said
[1:32:13] we're going back to Eden yeah I thought
[1:32:16] I thought we were going to New Jerusalem
[1:32:18] we
[1:32:19] are because New Jerusalem is the
[1:32:24] presence of God walking among his
[1:32:28] creation and the kings of the Earth come
[1:32:31] and they get fellowship with God Amen
[1:32:35] and it continues their life that's right
[1:32:39] because that brothers and sisters is
[1:32:42] God's only desire is to share himself
[1:32:47] with humanity and even in the message we
[1:32:51] make ourself the benefit officiary of
[1:32:54] that Fellowship when we are the
[1:32:57] expressor of that
[1:33:00] Fellowship this is a very very important
[1:33:04] position it is very very important to
[1:33:06] all creation what has happened yeah and
[1:33:09] I sharing with brother brother Chad last
[1:33:12] night you know it's it's interesting and
[1:33:15] we'll close on this lot Lord
[1:33:18] willing CU my wife will tell you that I
[1:33:21] oh no can I share One More Story
[1:33:24] but but you watch the the life of
[1:33:27] brother brandom you watch the
[1:33:29] progression of the word you know when
[1:33:31] you and he goes to the 50s you know and
[1:33:33] in 56 57 he's dealing really with the
[1:33:35] new birth you know he's dealing a lot
[1:33:38] with the new spirit you know and and and
[1:33:40] so forth and the new birth why are we so
[1:33:41] tossed about you know all these things
[1:33:44] and then he comes you know I mean a
[1:33:45] progression and he comes in
[1:33:48] 1962 then he begins putting up
[1:33:50] word but it's in but it's a process
[1:33:54] to make way for the opening of the book
[1:33:58] right so then 63 you know he's
[1:34:00] commissioned to come back and and and
[1:34:02] and he and he opens the seals had a
[1:34:05] brother ask me the other day he said did
[1:34:07] the who opened the seals I said the lamb
[1:34:10] did oh well but brother but brother
[1:34:12] Brenham did I said no brother brandham
[1:34:14] didn't open the seals the lamb opened
[1:34:15] the
[1:34:16] seals you know the the the the lamb was
[1:34:19] using Brother brandom's
[1:34:21] voice but it wasn't brother Bram brother
[1:34:24] brandom had nothing to do with it right
[1:34:26] but anyway so you watch the progression
[1:34:28] of the word but then in
[1:34:30] 1965 brother brandom starts dealing with
[1:34:32] the seed Gene of God and then he gets to
[1:34:36] to me the
[1:34:38] climax of the 1965 C Gene of God is
[1:34:42] invisible Union which I didn't
[1:34:44] understand for many
[1:34:45] years but in invisible union he says
[1:34:50] it's as though you never did it in the
[1:34:51] first
[1:34:52] place because the SE the seed Gene of
[1:34:55] God never sinned do you know that you
[1:34:57] could never even be
[1:34:58] lost you know the prophet said in 1964
[1:35:01] and future home he said there wasn't a
[1:35:03] certain day that you were born that you
[1:35:05] were saved you were always saved that's
[1:35:08] right right you're always a part of him
[1:35:10] but here you watch the progression of
[1:35:12] the prophet and you watching what
[1:35:13] happens a month before brother brandham
[1:35:15] goes off the scene he preaches false
[1:35:19] anointed
[1:35:20] ones now why didn't he preach false
[1:35:23] anointed ones in 1956 right you know
[1:35:26] when he's dealing with the new birth and
[1:35:28] he's dealing with the with the spir oh
[1:35:30] by the way the the holy spirit's an
[1:35:32] office work too and the reason that you
[1:35:35] can be baptized with the office work of
[1:35:37] God all every hour of your life is
[1:35:40] because when he the spirit of Truth has
[1:35:42] come he will guide you into all truth if
[1:35:46] you had not been lost you would never
[1:35:49] receive the holy
[1:35:51] spirit because the holy Spirit was sent
[1:35:55] Jesus said he will not speak of himself
[1:35:58] yeah he will speak the things that I
[1:36:00] tell you he is to bring that attribute
[1:36:03] to sunship so what happens to the false
[1:36:05] anointed ones well they receive the Holy
[1:36:08] Spirit right but there's no seed of Gene
[1:36:11] there's no Gene of God to lead to
[1:36:13] sunship so they just manifest
[1:36:16] works right and brother brandham dropped
[1:36:19] that right in a month before he goes off
[1:36:21] the scene because it's in the message
[1:36:24] it's not the Benny hens yeah that's not
[1:36:27] even that's not even a factor to the
[1:36:30] bride all right I asked the church I
[1:36:32] said I said if the if if if
[1:36:35] denominations is so close it would
[1:36:37] deceive the very elect how many of you
[1:36:39] thought about stopping at the Baptist
[1:36:40] Church on the way
[1:36:42] here because it's so
[1:36:44] close it's not close at all amen but
[1:36:48] what's close is the message amen right
[1:36:52] and so brother
[1:36:54] gives us a
[1:36:57] warning amen that's right yeah amen and
[1:37:00] you know what it's the greatest battle
[1:37:04] that's ever fought all right it's not
[1:37:07] with the devil it's not with
[1:37:10] denominations it's with this it's The
[1:37:14] Last Enemy that's destroyed is death
[1:37:17] yeah and when your Humanity I I can I
[1:37:21] can have I can give a a recommendation
[1:37:24] I mean brother Chad your pastor but I
[1:37:27] would say fall in love with the message
[1:37:29] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:37:31] amen because that to me has been the
[1:37:35] key to this
[1:37:37] message it's not about the knowledge
[1:37:41] that we obtain it's not about all of our
[1:37:44] teaching I'll tell you what my favorite
[1:37:45] scripture in the whole Bible 1 Timothy 1
[1:37:48] and verse5 the end of the Commandment is
[1:37:52] Charity out of appe your
[1:37:54] heart the end of all the teaching the
[1:37:57] end of all the things all of the
[1:37:59] doctrine the end of all that if it does
[1:38:02] not pro produce the Life of Christ the
[1:38:05] love of God himself in you it doesn't
[1:38:09] matter what you believe amen false
[1:38:11] anointed ones right you
[1:38:14] see and so here he is brother Brandon
[1:38:17] preaches this message right at the end
[1:38:19] when brother ran and preached The Sixth
[1:38:21] Seal he had Jesus on Mount olives all
[1:38:25] right in Matthew 24 and he goes to
[1:38:27] Matthew 24 and he begins opening the
[1:38:30] seals right and he's got he says okay
[1:38:33] this scripture is the first seal second
[1:38:34] third fourth fifth and then he skips
[1:38:38] some scriptures and then he reads you
[1:38:41] know now after the tribulation of those
[1:38:43] days and so forth he said that's the
[1:38:44] Sixth
[1:38:45] Seal do you know that those scriptures
[1:38:48] that he that he skipped were the
[1:38:51] scriptures that he used when he preached
[1:38:53] false anointed
[1:38:54] ones and in the middle of those
[1:38:57] scriptures there's a scripture where
[1:38:59] Jesus says and in that day there shall
[1:39:02] be Great Tribulation such as never has
[1:39:05] been before never will be since because
[1:39:09] it's not the Great Tribulation of three
[1:39:12] and A2 years of turmoil it's the Great
[1:39:15] Tribulation between here and here and
[1:39:18] what makes this the greatest tribulation
[1:39:21] that has ever been is what is stake yeah
[1:39:25] because if we don't come to our position
[1:39:28] everything is lost that's right amen
[1:39:30] everything that's is L the the
[1:39:33] Redemptive work of Jesus would have been
[1:39:35] for
[1:39:37] nothing amen that's a pretty important
[1:39:40] place so this message that was came to
[1:39:43] restore that came to restore the word
[1:39:46] and we say okay it came to restore the
[1:39:48] Bible and and I get that because brother
[1:39:52] bram's message was a flashlight on this
[1:39:55] word all right you cannot use brother
[1:39:58] brandom's message outside of the
[1:40:01] Bible and there are plenty of people
[1:40:03] that
[1:40:03] do you know I I've I've I've heard of
[1:40:06] people that say this is a seven seal
[1:40:10] book this is the opening of the book so
[1:40:15] which one should I
[1:40:16] read you better read this
[1:40:19] one right because this one EXP explains
[1:40:23] this one but this is where the life is
[1:40:27] amen amen and so so I I have lost my
[1:40:34] thought and uh which I do a lot and uh
[1:40:38] so I think that we'll just we're we're
[1:40:40] at the we're past the end so I think
[1:40:42] we'll just let's all just
[1:40:44] stand and
[1:40:47] U and we'll bow our hearts of brother
[1:40:49] Chad if you want to come up our
[1:40:51] wonderful heavenly father we thank you
[1:40:54] so much for the uh the freedom the

[1:41:06] that word I know it's it's always uh a

[1:41:12] the opportunity to share and so Lord I
[1:41:15] Thank you for this I thank you for this
[1:41:17] Con congregation I thank you for uh what

[1:43:06] lives amen how many want to
[1:43:09] die more I wish I could die I wish I
[1:43:12] could on my own just shut off all my
[1:43:16] thinking it's going to take a revelation
[1:43:18] from God and I I sit and listen to these
[1:43:20] things I know there's a depth to what
[1:43:22] the the brother's telling that's a
[1:43:24] reality but it's not it's not something
[1:43:26] I can conjure here or I can even put
[1:43:28] together like 2+ 2al 4 it's not that
[1:43:30] kind of a thing there's a reality deep
[1:43:33] inside that God's trying to draw out of
[1:43:35] us say oh God I want to live that
[1:43:38] reality am amen oh I I wish that I could
[1:43:43] reprogram
[1:43:44] myself I realize where the problem is
[1:43:47] the problem is in the veil the problem
[1:43:49] is in the thinking amen but God has done
[1:43:51] something tremendous in the this hour
[1:43:53] friends he's
[1:43:55] unlocked he's opened the door he's
[1:43:57] unlocked the potential the possibility
[1:43:59] to by faith for us to enter into what he
[1:44:01] always wanted amen and I'm just saying
[1:44:04] God take me there I can't take myself
[1:44:07] there take me there by Revelation let me
[1:44:10] go beyond thinking let me go beyond time
[1:44:12] let me go back and connect to what was
[1:44:14] always there and when the brother showed
[1:44:17] us where where that seven sealed book
[1:44:20] was laying and brother Brenham said what
[1:44:22] is the believer the words in the book
[1:44:24] amen so the believer is the words in the
[1:44:26] book are you a Believer then where were
[1:44:28] you in the book what is the book the
[1:44:31] book represents the Believers the the
[1:44:33] body of Christ the the the the the Flesh
[1:44:35] of God amen amen right so we were there
[1:44:39] all along amen we were always in the
[1:44:42] hand of God we were always there we were
[1:44:44] always secure waiting for a time that
[1:44:46] God would unveil it to us
[1:44:49] amen say God unveil it to me more I need
[1:44:53] more of the unveiling I need more of the
[1:44:55] open I need the seals of my life to open
[1:44:57] more amen than they have so that we can
[1:45:01] do what he's called us to do in this
[1:45:03] hour amen which is come and manifest
[1:45:07] himself amen God all I can say is God
[1:45:11] help
[1:45:12] me perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:45:16] I'm going to go listen to that message
[1:45:18] again amen let's just bow our heads and
[1:45:21] thank God for this word
[1:45:23] dear heavenly father we thank
[1:45:26] you God we
[1:45:28] realize as we listen to your word being
[1:45:31] preached Lord there's so much more of
[1:45:34] the reality of the
[1:45:36] Revelation than what our minds can even
[1:45:38] pieace
[1:45:40] together God there's an We've Come to an
[1:45:42] hour where you want to have a certain
[1:45:44] expression Lord and you've called us to
[1:45:47] be part of that expression and Lord we
[1:45:50] don't know exactly how we can do that
[1:45:52] there's no way in ourselves that we can
[1:45:54] do what you want to do but Lord we're
[1:45:57] asking God that if you would help us to
[1:45:59] die to die to our thinking to die to our
[1:46:02] desires to die out to everything and
[1:46:04] give you
[1:46:05] preeminence so that you can come and do
[1:46:07] the work that you've ordained for this
[1:46:09] hour we believe what your Prophet said
[1:46:12] Lord about us about the position that we

[1:46:33] plan Lord we ask a special blessing over
[1:46:36] our brother Stan and over his wife Lord

[1:47:18] things that you've opened to us may they
[1:47:20] not fade away but may they be rooted
[1:47:22] deeply into our souls and may they bring

[1:47:25] manifestation for I believe that's the
