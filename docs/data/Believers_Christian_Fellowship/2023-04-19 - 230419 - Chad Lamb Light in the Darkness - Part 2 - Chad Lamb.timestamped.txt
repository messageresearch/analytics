[15:43] amen
[15:44] praise God
[15:46] I was just thinking we need more
[15:48] revelation
[15:51] sometimes the revelation we need most is
[15:53] the revelation of who we really are
[15:56] in Christ amen let's bow our heads
[15:59] together and pray
[16:01] their Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[16:03] for the privilege that you've granted us
[16:05] this evening to be here that you have
[16:07] drawn us and you provided a place and a
[16:10] time for your children to gather and
[16:12] you've drawn Us by your own hand
[16:14] now Lord we want to surrender ourselves
[16:16] completely to you surrender our thinking

[16:21] gone through the day and where we're at
[16:23] We Just Surrender it all to you Lord and

[16:27] Moment In Time

[16:37] receive your word and may it come into a
[16:39] heart that's prepared soil that's been

[16:57] amen may God bless you while we're
[17:00] standing let's turn to Exodus chapter 20
[17:02] together Exodus chapter 20.
[17:05] I want to continue on with the thought
[17:07] light and darkness this would be part
[17:09] two and then I'm going to just recap
[17:11] just something from the tail end of
[17:13] Sunday service and then going to a
[17:15] different direction so I just pray bear
[17:18] with me in that also want to remind you
[17:20] that Brother Kyle will be traveling down
[17:22] to Junction City Ohio this Sunday to
[17:25] minister for that ex-amish group of new
[17:27] Believers and they're fresh and they're
[17:29] hungry for the word and so I know
[17:31] Brother Kyle would love to be God's tool
[17:33] Amen in the hand of God so just pray for
[17:35] him and also want to say that this past
[17:38] Sunday the youth group went up to
[17:41] literal Life church and they sang a
[17:44] special up there at the Tri-State youth
[17:46] meeting and I want to say you guys did a
[17:48] wonderful job that was a beautiful song
[17:50] and say God bless you for that and
[17:52] hopefully it's out on the internet
[17:54] somewhere where everybody else can hear
[17:55] it I don't know I'm not good at those
[17:56] things but it was a blessing it blessed
[17:58] me so thank you and God bless you
[18:00] amen let's read Exodus 20. Verse 18
[18:04] together Exodus 20 verse 18.
[18:12] and all the people saw the thunderings
[18:14] and the Lightnings and the noise of the
[18:16] trumpet and the mountain smoking and
[18:17] when the people saw it they removed and
[18:19] stood afar off
[18:21] and they said unto Moses speak thou with
[18:23] us and we will hear but let not God
[18:25] speak with us lest we die and Moses said
[18:28] unto the people fear not for God has
[18:30] come to prove you and that his fear may
[18:33] not may be before your faces that you
[18:35] sin not and the people stood afar off
[18:38] and Moses Drew near unto the thick
[18:40] Darkness where God was amen God bless
[18:43] you as you take your seats
[18:46] we talked to if we want to bring up the
[18:49] PowerPoint brother Franco we talked uh
[18:51] last Sunday when we were preaching about
[18:54] the light and darkness and how amen God
[18:57] dwells in the thick Darkness Solomon
[18:59] said so that God dwells said he would
[19:01] dwell in the thick darkness and here on
[19:03] Mount Sinai God came down and when God
[19:06] comes down amen we we would imagine God
[19:09] coming down Amen to speak to his people
[19:12] that that should be something nice
[19:15] something pleasant something easy but
[19:17] when God came down to speak directly to
[19:20] his people it was terrifying amen there
[19:23] was thunderings and there was Lightnings
[19:24] and there was a furnace of fire and
[19:26] smoke and billowing smoke and a cloud
[19:28] and the Earth Shook and trembled and the
[19:31] people were terrified and what was it it
[19:33] was God coming down
[19:35] God was coming down Amen to prove them
[19:38] but they ran from the presence of God
[19:40] and moved afar off from the mountain
[19:42] when they were supposed to come up to
[19:43] him they moved away from him amen and so
[19:46] they commissioned Moses to go and Moses
[19:48] went into the thick Darkness where God
[19:51] was amen so we talked about that and
[19:53] then we talked about how uh the seeds
[19:55] that were down under the darkness
[19:57] shrouded in darkness of the earth and
[19:59] job said that God made Darkness a
[20:01] swaddling ban for the Earth but under
[20:03] the darkness were seeds that were
[20:05] dermatized with life in them they had
[20:07] light amen and when the condition was
[20:09] right and the light came to the seeds
[20:11] amen they sprung forth the life and
[20:13] brother Branham and the four seal typed
[20:15] that with you and I
[20:16] now we come into the Earth shroud and in
[20:18] darkness our mind is clouded amen and
[20:20] enmity with God is what the Bible says
[20:22] and we're strapped and we're swaddled in
[20:25] this hybridization of flesh but down on
[20:27] the inside amen there's a seed of life
[20:30] amen with light inside waiting to come
[20:32] in contact with the light for the season
[20:34] to bring it to life and it Springs
[20:36] forward amen and so then we begin to
[20:39] understand about ourselves amen and we
[20:42] ended with this and I want to just take
[20:44] a a quick second and hit a few slides on
[20:46] this and I want to move into the
[20:47] direction for tonight
[20:50] Amen brother Branham says in what is the
[20:52] attraction on the mountain what is the
[20:55] light up on Sunset mountain in the
[20:57] Coronado Forest of Arizona what is this
[21:00] strange thing that happened up there
[21:01] that the people has been driving east
[21:03] from West picking up rocks that laid
[21:05] around with their where it struck and
[21:07] every one of them every Rock has three
[21:09] corners on it that tore off the three
[21:11] are one they're laying on desks on
[21:13] paperweights across Nation what is the
[21:15] strange thing upon sunset Mountain and
[21:18] the Coronado Forest
[21:20] I think it's interesting brother Ben
[21:21] said what is this light
[21:23] up on Sunset Mountain
[21:26] and he shows the Pyramid of cloud amen
[21:29] and and then later on when brother
[21:30] benham's there and and the and the
[21:32] Whirlwind comes down and blasts the
[21:34] rocks out of the mountain all the Rocks
[21:35] were three cornered rocks in a pyramid
[21:38] shape and here we have a a
[21:39] pyramid-shaped cloud and and it's all
[21:42] showing the same thing the three are one
[21:43] that God has come Amen to unite with his
[21:46] people amen and brother Benham calls it
[21:48] a light what is this light amen and some
[21:50] call to the cloud brother Branham calls
[21:52] it a light
[21:53] praise God and he goes on to say that
[21:57] shall never die
[21:58] it's constantly unrolling itself from
[22:01] the very thing happening to the picture
[22:03] being Jesus standing looking at us and
[22:06] now exactly on Sunset mountain and the
[22:09] sunset light the evening light has come
[22:11] God vindicating himself
[22:16] he said in God's power to transform
[22:18] that's the day we're living in right now
[22:20] the light will shine just at the evening
[22:22] when the darkness is setting in Twilight
[22:26] time the evening star so now this is the
[22:30] black and white version of the picture
[22:31] and you know brother Brown was told turn
[22:33] it right you know he turn it to the
[22:34] right and there he sees amen it's the
[22:36] face of Christ amen and it's shrouded
[22:39] and wigged in the angel's wings and and
[22:41] and and he turns it brother M himself
[22:43] amen has to turn it right to see and he
[22:47] says that's our Lord up there
[22:49] in the scripture in second Corinthians 4
[22:51] 6 says for God who commanded the light
[22:53] to shine out of Darkness has shine in
[22:55] our hearts to give the light of the
[22:57] knowledge of the glory of God and the
[22:58] face of Jesus Christ
[23:00] is the mystery of God revealed
[23:06] amen
[23:08] and then I want to go back to the
[23:09] scripture we read at the beginning of
[23:11] Sunday
[23:12] and the angel of God which went before
[23:13] the camp of Israel removed and went
[23:15] behind them and the pillar of cloud went
[23:17] from before their face and stood behind
[23:20] them and it came between the camp of the
[23:22] Egyptians in the camp of Israel and it
[23:24] was a cloud and darkness to them
[23:27] but it gave light by night to these
[23:30] on one side it was a cloud and darkness
[23:32] on the other it was light to these
[23:35] I want to be on the light side
[23:39] amen so there you know we live in the
[23:43] day where there's been arguments and
[23:44] debates over the cloud and whatever and
[23:46] to some it's a cloud
[23:49] to me it's the light of the hour
[23:52] to some it brought confusion to some
[23:54] about questions and they're trying to
[23:56] discern the cloud and what materials are
[23:58] made out of and what how high is it and
[24:01] was it this material that material and
[24:02] for me it doesn't matter the material
[24:05] amen that's my Lord up there it's the
[24:07] light coming back Amen to the earth and
[24:09] the time of darkness when darkness is
[24:11] setting in amen the evening light has
[24:14] come
[24:15] so for me I I don't want to be on the
[24:17] dark side of analyzing a cloud I want to
[24:20] see the light amen that cloud brought
[24:23] light to you and I amen so it just goes
[24:26] to show for one for one the same event
[24:29] the same scripture the same
[24:31] circumstances can be Darkness for
[24:33] another it can be light
[24:35] and that's the way it is in our life
[24:37] sometimes as Christians the same event
[24:39] for one can be Darkness for another it
[24:41] can be light
[24:43] and so that's what I I want to make a
[24:45] turn now and that that was just the wrap
[24:47] up from Sunday I want to take the same
[24:49] title different subject
[24:52] I don't know why let's just let's just
[24:54] go with it amen
[24:56] light in the darkness but I want to look
[24:58] at light in the darkness from another
[24:59] angle in another way amen but it's the
[25:02] same title amen but when I was
[25:04] meditating on this God brought the
[25:05] inspiration for Sunday but on top of it
[25:07] he brought the inspiration for tonight
[25:08] amen so I can use the same title for
[25:11] both and this is the scripture there's a
[25:13] scripture and a quote that I want to put
[25:15] together in Psalms 1 12 4 he says unto
[25:18] the upright there arise of the light in
[25:21] the Darkness
[25:23] he is gracious and full of compassion
[25:25] and righteous so unto the upright there
[25:29] ariseth light in the Darkness
[25:32] amen and by God's grace he has called us
[25:35] his upright he's called us to be the
[25:37] upright in this age and he has set us
[25:39] upright by his grace by his word amen
[25:43] and into the upright there arises of
[25:45] light and darkness so that means if
[25:47] you're one of God's chosen following
[25:49] after God Amen God will cause to arise
[25:53] light in the darkness so whatever
[25:56] Darkness you face amen If You by Grace
[25:58] have been positioned to be one of the
[26:00] upright ones in this end time then God
[26:02] will rise light out of the darkness amen
[26:05] every Darkness we face every dark
[26:07] circumstance we come in contact with we
[26:10] have to understand who we are amen and
[26:13] God is not allowed a darkness in my life
[26:15] maybe a dark set of circumstances maybe
[26:18] a dark trial but that darkness is not to
[26:21] destroy me or swallow me up or engulf me
[26:24] amen but God will arise a light in that
[26:26] Darkness
[26:28] and everything I faced I Believe by
[26:30] where God has positioned Me by Grace
[26:32] amen we realize none of us have put
[26:34] ourselves in any position we can't put
[26:37] ourselves in any position
[26:39] amen neither can an oak tree become a
[26:42] palm tree or a palm tree become a maple
[26:44] tree amen you you are what you are amen
[26:48] by the seed that you're born in born
[26:51] with
[26:53] so an oak tree can't take pride in being
[26:56] an oak tree and and a and a palm can't
[26:58] take pride in being a palm amen but an
[27:01] oak tree amen also should not be living
[27:04] in denial that it's an oak tree
[27:09] amen do you see what I'm trying to say
[27:12] Amen we we we we
[27:15] don't want to uh we don't want to allow
[27:18] God's grace in our lives to bring a
[27:20] sense of Pride amen our entitlement
[27:22] because that's not what it's all about
[27:23] amen it's the grace of God and for us it
[27:26] should make us humble to realize what we
[27:28] would be without Grace without the
[27:30] foreknowledge of God and the
[27:31] predestination we would be as lost in
[27:33] darkness as anybody else's lost in
[27:35] darkness but it's the grace of God that
[27:37] has brought light to us
[27:39] we didn't go and find it we didn't make
[27:41] it appear God did it all and we didn't
[27:43] put ourselves in contact he put it in
[27:45] contact with us amen
[27:47] by his grace so that can bring no Pride
[27:49] but it should bring a recognition of who
[27:52] I am amen because God has planted a seed
[27:55] inside of me and brought a light along
[27:57] to to Quicken this seed in me and now
[28:00] there's another life living inside of me
[28:03] the original life what God intended for
[28:05] me from the beginning
[28:07] but not now it doesn't do me any good
[28:10] I'm never going to get anywhere in life
[28:12] amen if I don't surrender to the life
[28:14] that's in me
[28:16] amen and surrender to the position that
[28:19] he positioned me in
[28:21] so if God calls me bride then I want to
[28:25] believe I'm bride
[28:28] because in getting in line with the
[28:30] Revelation I'll begin to produce Pride
[28:33] fruits
[28:34] not living in denial all the time how
[28:37] could I be and maybe I'm not my last
[28:39] mistake and all of this and constantly
[28:42] living in a state of Doubt amen I'm not
[28:45] going to get anywhere until I come in
[28:47] alignment with the predestinated plan
[28:49] for God and I accept what God said about
[28:52] me
[28:53] amen always in the Bible it was critical
[28:56] that the people that God called accepted
[28:58] their calling
[29:00] recognized who they were
[29:03] amen and so it's I think the same thing
[29:05] holds true for you and I
[29:07] that we need to accept God's calling and
[29:10] accept who we are because the upright
[29:12] there arises light in the Darkness
[29:16] so now we don't have to be afraid of the
[29:19] darkness
[29:22] we live in the darkest time
[29:25] we live in Satan's Eden we live in a
[29:28] blackout of the church systems that
[29:31] laodicea has gone into total darkness
[29:33] when the when the when the lunar eclipse
[29:36] was shown Amen to uh on the newspapers
[29:39] there brother pointed to it the
[29:42] beginning of 1964. Amen it showed six
[29:45] but didn't show the seventh amen because
[29:47] it was totally blacked out there was no
[29:49] picture to take showing that laodicea
[29:51] had gone into complete apostasy
[29:54] so in the religious world it's total
[29:57] blackness
[29:58] political world total Blackness
[30:00] Financial World total Blackness amen I
[30:03] don't it's the world has gone into
[30:06] darkness but we don't have to be afraid
[30:08] of the darkness before the upright he'll
[30:11] allow a light to arise in the Darkness
[30:15] amen so the conditions of the world I've
[30:18] said this before but I want to reiterate
[30:20] and these things tonight amen don't wait
[30:22] for the new thing to come there's
[30:23] nothing new coming this is a reminder
[30:27] amen
[30:29] amen
[30:30] the the conditions of the world should
[30:34] not be causing us anxiety
[30:37] the news reports should not be causing
[30:40] us anxiety the political systems the
[30:43] financial systems should not be causing
[30:44] us anxiety amen because there's already
[30:47] prophecy telling us this would go this
[30:49] way
[30:51] so if anything we should be encouraged
[30:53] amen that God is bringing the prophecy
[30:55] to fruition amen because we know when
[30:58] the world goes into a total collapse
[31:00] it's an Escape for the bride
[31:04] right and so we should not we should see
[31:08] that in the darkness of the age God is
[31:10] allowing to the upright a light to arise
[31:13] our world should be getting brighter not
[31:15] darker
[31:16] as the world gets darker our personal
[31:18] life should get brighter our world
[31:20] should get brighter
[31:22] the Revelation should become clearer
[31:25] so then this is the quote that was on my
[31:27] mind
[31:28] and Elijah in the meal offering
[31:31] says in Germany
[31:34] they've got a picture they call it the
[31:36] clown picture
[31:38] it's a it's a competent to this great
[31:41] picture of the crucifixion that forced
[31:43] lawn in Los Angeles the great picture
[31:45] it's as wide as the building is across
[31:47] they have a build a building around the
[31:49] picture many of you have seen him but
[31:51] this in Germany is called the angel or
[31:53] the cloud day I believe it's called and
[31:56] when you get off from the piece from it
[31:57] you get off a piece from it and look at
[31:59] it it looks hideous looks like Angry
[32:02] clouds are mixing around one another
[32:03] like that as the light reflects on him
[32:06] and look like the clouds are moving is
[32:08] the way the picture is made to reflect
[32:10] the lines make it look like the cloud an
[32:12] angry storm coming to tear up everything
[32:15] I want you to catch that it looks like
[32:17] an angry storm coming to tear up
[32:19] everything and then you're told by the
[32:22] guide walk closer
[32:24] and just keep watching it and when you
[32:27] get real close to it it isn't clouds
[32:29] it's angel's wings of beating together
[32:31] rejoicing it's a blessing in
[32:34] disguisement
[32:36] amen so this is where I was drawing
[32:38] inspiration from the light in the
[32:40] darkness and the scripture from Psalms
[32:42] to the upright he'll allow a rise a
[32:45] light in the darkness amen from afar off
[32:49] amen this picture looks terrible it
[32:51] looks like a storm it looks like Angry
[32:53] clouds coming to tear everything up amen
[32:55] but as you got closer and closer to it
[32:57] you realize it's angel's wings beating
[33:00] together it's a blessing and
[33:02] disguisement
[33:04] and and that I believe is the way we
[33:07] should view trials and tribulations and
[33:09] darkness that's trying to encroach Upon
[33:11] Us Their Blessings and disguisement
[33:14] amen
[33:16] that may be hard to swallow that may be
[33:19] hard to believe but I think scripturally
[33:21] we can see that it's true
[33:25] when we look at this picture
[33:27] this is the three Hebrews and the fiery
[33:31] furnace
[33:32] but we don't see three we see four
[33:35] because who's the fourth one
[33:37] the fourth one is the son of God
[33:40] when did they come in contact with the
[33:42] son of God
[33:43] in their prayer meeting
[33:46] no they came in contact with the Son of
[33:48] God in the fiery furnace
[33:51] he manifest himself to them in the
[33:54] furnace amen
[33:55] let's look together at Daniel chapter
[33:57] three let's turn to this together
[34:00] we're going to hit just a couple of
[34:01] these examples
[34:04] Daniel chapter 3.
[34:12] and we'll go to verse 23 Daniel chapter
[34:15] 3
[34:22] Daniel chapter 3 verse 23.
[34:25] and these three men Shadrach Meshach and
[34:28] Abednego fell down bound into the midst
[34:30] of the burning fiery furnace then
[34:32] Nebuchadnezzar the King was astoned and
[34:35] Rose up in haste and spake and said unto
[34:36] his counselors did not we cast three men
[34:39] bound into the midst of the fire they
[34:41] answered and said unto the king true O
[34:43] King he answered and said lo I see four
[34:46] men loose walking in the midst of the
[34:48] fire and they have no hurt in the form
[34:50] of the fourth is like the son of God
[34:54] amen there was a whole story that
[34:55] transpired and that there was a a
[34:58] religious system coming into play a
[35:00] forced worship I mean we know all of
[35:01] these things and these three Hebrews
[35:03] withstood it they refused to bow at at
[35:06] the the bidding of the king and and the
[35:08] King begins to to tell them that they're
[35:10] going to be bound they're going to be
[35:12] punished and and and the three Hebrew
[35:14] children they they say Amen oh King live
[35:17] forever they're never disrespectful to
[35:19] the authorities that are around them
[35:20] that's important to note but they never
[35:22] compromise on the word
[35:24] oh King live forever amen our God is
[35:27] able to deliver us
[35:29] amen but even if he doesn't
[35:32] they didn't have God in their pocket
[35:36] to where they could control God and say
[35:38] God's going to do this and God's going
[35:39] to do that and God's going to do this
[35:41] they couldn't control God they were
[35:43] depending on God to control the
[35:44] situation but they were trusting in a
[35:46] living God
[35:48] and they said we we know that God is
[35:51] able to deliver us but even if he
[35:53] doesn't we will not bow we cannot go
[35:56] beyond the word amen we cannot
[35:59] compromise on the word we cannot change
[36:01] the word O King live forever we respect
[36:03] you but we're not going to Bow and even
[36:05] if God doesn't Deliver us see they
[36:07] weren't willing to find out what God
[36:09] would do first and base their action
[36:11] upon the reaction of God they were
[36:13] basing their action upon the word of God
[36:15] trusting God
[36:20] they did not know that Christ would
[36:23] manifest himself in the fire
[36:26] all they knew was that I can't do this
[36:30] and they were walking you know they
[36:32] heated it seven times hotter the Wrath
[36:34] of the King was great amen it was so hot
[36:36] that the ones who were carrying them up
[36:37] it slew them we know all these it's
[36:39] terrible but as they're walking up the
[36:41] ramp no manifestation if they're
[36:43] standing before the king no
[36:44] manifestation they didn't know what's
[36:46] going to happen next they're moving into
[36:48] a dark situation into a terrible trial
[36:52] amen but the moment that they're cast
[36:54] down into the very worst of the worst of
[36:57] the worst amen all of a sudden their
[37:00] bands are loosed and Christ is there
[37:02] with them
[37:04] amen because we're the upright he'll
[37:06] cause a light to arise in the Darkness
[37:09] we have all of these examples not so we
[37:12] can tell Sunday School Stories so that
[37:14] we can see ourselves and see what God
[37:16] can do for us amen these are Sunday
[37:19] School Stories these are living
[37:20] realities this wasn't a Sunday School
[37:22] Story to these three Hebrews this was
[37:23] life
[37:25] it wasn't a story that they repeated it
[37:27] wasn't uh some mythical thing this was
[37:30] their life they lived this they didn't
[37:31] talk about it they lived it
[37:35] so that we would know if we are elect
[37:38] like they are elect
[37:40] then God knows when and how to come on
[37:42] the scene
[37:44] he knows where we're at he knows what's
[37:46] going on
[37:47] and we don't have to worry
[37:49] about what's happening we can trust in
[37:52] him
[37:54] we go to this one
[37:56] let's go to Daniel chapter six
[38:10] Daniel chapter 6 verse 21.
[38:14] this is after Daniel had spent the night
[38:16] in the Lion's Den the king comes and
[38:18] asks him if he's all right verse 21 then
[38:21] said Daniel unto the king O King live
[38:23] forever may God my God has sent his
[38:26] Angel and has shut the Lion's mouths
[38:28] that they have not hurt me for as much
[38:31] as before him innocency was found in me
[38:33] and also before thee O King have I done
[38:35] no hurt
[38:36] then was the king exceedingly glad for
[38:38] him and commanded that they should take
[38:40] Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was
[38:43] taken up out of the den and no manner of
[38:45] hurt was found upon him because he
[38:48] believed in his God
[38:51] amen
[38:52] Daniel believed in his God that's why
[38:55] there was no hurt on him amen Daniel
[38:57] didn't know what would happen at least
[38:59] there's no indication in the scriptures
[39:00] that Daniel knew what would happen but
[39:02] Daniel knew I can't obey this new law he
[39:05] has to pray to his God Amen in so doing
[39:08] Daniel's going to be executed by lions
[39:12] and then once again this is life to them
[39:15] this is a dark trial and he's going into
[39:17] the dark dungeon of the Lion's Den amen
[39:19] but in that place the angel of the Lord
[39:22] comes in that place the light arises and
[39:25] stops the mouths of the Lions and
[39:27] becomes a tremendous testimony to that
[39:30] King into the whole nation
[39:32] so from this we're learning that we
[39:35] don't have to get anxious about anything
[39:39] amen
[39:40] we say that but we still get anxious
[39:43] that's why we need to know who we are
[39:46] and what God's done for others and what
[39:48] God will do for us in the hour we live
[39:49] in and who we are in God's side amen so
[39:52] that we can we can keep encouraging
[39:54] ourselves in the Lord and stay planted
[39:56] on Solid Ground despite what's going on
[39:58] around us
[40:01] in this in this message brother Ben says
[40:03] here they go through the Wilderness now
[40:06] after the old-fashioned meeting now
[40:08] they're on their Journey isn't it
[40:10] strange that they he was led right
[40:11] straight to the Wilderness of sin right
[40:13] up to the Wilderness right up from to
[40:15] the Fountain of bitter water they come
[40:17] right out of the crossing the Red Sea
[40:19] spoiling Egypt crossing the Red Sea
[40:21] right to the bitter water and this is
[40:23] what brother Brown said could you
[40:24] imagine God taking his children right
[40:26] after they got saved filled with the
[40:28] Holy Ghost to a fountain of bitter water
[40:30] sure he'd like to express his love to
[40:34] them again
[40:36] oh praise God
[40:38] that's right they got up there you know
[40:40] when you get the Holy Ghost you attend a
[40:42] lot of obstacles many are many are the
[40:45] afflictions of the righteous but God
[40:47] delivered them out of them all God
[40:48] brings you right up facing with it so he
[40:51] can show you his power and his goodness
[40:56] brother Branham does some wonderful
[40:58] things in the word amen to bring us to a
[41:01] higher Revelation and understanding of
[41:03] the life we live in we are not going to
[41:05] live a life free of trial and
[41:07] tribulations God doesn't want us to
[41:10] it meant so much Prosperity preaching
[41:12] another kind of preaching and it makes
[41:14] it makes it sound like God never wants
[41:17] you to suffer any God doesn't want any
[41:19] hardship or any obstacles to come your
[41:21] way that God's a doting grandfather and
[41:23] he wants to remove everything so that
[41:24] you can live a blessed life and
[41:25] everything can be perfect amen but
[41:27] brother Branham come along and told us
[41:29] that's not the reason we're living in
[41:31] this Earth We're living here for
[41:33] education so that we can gain character
[41:35] to Reign by in the next life
[41:37] and the character is a victory not a
[41:39] gift and it comes through hardships
[41:41] through trials through testings
[41:44] so the prophet of God came and he
[41:46] brought reality back to Christianity
[41:49] the churches have taken reality away
[41:51] amen but he's coming brought reality
[41:53] back so that you can live the same kind
[41:55] of Life they lived in the scriptures
[41:58] so then we're not confused when
[42:00] difficult circumstances come up there's
[42:02] no confusion
[42:04] now God why would he bring him
[42:07] out of Egypt Into the Wilderness
[42:10] delivered them from a mighty hand slew
[42:12] the army that was after them brought
[42:14] them into such a wonderful Victory and
[42:17] the next thing he does is he lands them
[42:18] by by a spring of bitter water that they
[42:21] can't even drink another trial why he
[42:23] wants to show them that he loves them
[42:25] some more
[42:30] God why is this happening to me God why
[42:33] why did you let this happen maybe he
[42:35] wants to show you who loves you again
[42:38] or maybe he wants to show you his power
[42:40] and his goodness
[42:43] maybe he allowed the circumstances to
[42:45] get such a way so that he can show you
[42:46] how able he is to deliver
[42:52] amen
[42:54] I like to do a better job
[42:58] of showing him that I trust him
[43:01] he's done an excellent job of showing us
[43:03] he can Deliver Us from everything
[43:06] If We Gather what's in this room today
[43:07] and we start talking about circumstances
[43:10] healings crisis all the things that have
[43:13] happened in our lives we're going to
[43:15] find out very quickly that God is able
[43:16] to deliver from every circumstance
[43:19] every past sin every Temptation every
[43:22] hurt every Affliction every family
[43:24] situation God is able to deliver from
[43:26] everything amen and and I I have seen
[43:30] God able to do Mighty things to show his
[43:33] love for his children and show his power
[43:34] and his goodness but I want to show him
[43:36] back that I trust him
[43:38] amen that's what I want to give to him
[43:43] I want to turn if we can
[43:46] um to mark 4.
[44:03] Mark chapter 4
[44:06] I'm going to read from verse 35.
[44:14] in the same day when even was come he
[44:16] saith unto them let us pass over into
[44:19] the other side
[44:20] and when they had sent away the
[44:22] multitude they took him even as he was
[44:24] in the ship and they were also with him
[44:26] other little ships and there arose a
[44:27] great storm of wind and the waves beat
[44:29] into the ship so that it was now full
[44:31] and he was in the hinder part of the
[44:33] ship asleep on a pillow and they awoke
[44:35] him and send him Master carest thou knot
[44:38] that we perish and he arose and rebuked
[44:40] the wind and said unto the sea peace be
[44:42] still and the wind ceased and there was
[44:44] a great calm and he said unto them why
[44:47] are you so fearful how is it that you
[44:49] have no faith and they feared
[44:51] exceedingly and said one to another what
[44:54] manner of man is this that even the wind
[44:56] and the Sea obey him
[45:00] I think God wanted to show his power and
[45:03] his goodness to them
[45:04] do you think Christ didn't know that the
[45:07] storm would come
[45:09] you think he was unaware of what was
[45:11] about to transpire unaware what was
[45:13] going on in the danger they were in amen
[45:15] but when he stood on the the bow of that
[45:17] boat and he said peace be still he was
[45:20] showing what what he was able to do for
[45:23] his children
[45:24] and all of a sudden they were astonished
[45:26] and they say what kind of man is this
[45:27] amen a God man that's what kind of man
[45:30] he is but he's the same Christ that's in
[45:32] our boat
[45:34] he's the same Christ that is in the ship
[45:37] he was in the ship all along the
[45:38] Deliverance was with them all along amen
[45:41] but waited to the condition to get so
[45:42] bad they had no option but calling him
[45:44] on the scene and when they called him on
[45:46] the scene he showed that he was always
[45:48] there and he was always able to calm the
[45:50] storm
[45:51] so why did he let the storm come to
[45:53] begin with if he could stop it why did
[45:55] he let it start
[45:56] maybe he wanted to show his power and
[45:59] his goodness
[46:00] to his children
[46:02] brother man tells the story of the
[46:04] Shepherd that took and broke a sheep's
[46:06] leg
[46:07] do you remember the story
[46:09] and somebody asked him why did you do
[46:10] that and starts telling because this
[46:13] little sheep I wanted to keep it close
[46:15] to me
[46:16] so that I can give a little extra love
[46:18] and attention so that it would know that
[46:19] I love it
[46:21] breaking a sheep's leg to give it extra
[46:25] attention to show it that it's loved
[46:29] would God do a thing like that
[46:32] if we need it
[46:34] he would do it
[46:37] would God do a thing like that I'm
[46:40] telling you a loving God
[46:42] would break you
[46:44] so that he can show his love to you
[46:47] a loving God will break your will will
[46:50] break everything about you a loving God
[46:52] will break he will break every hope
[46:56] every dream every desire he'll break it
[46:58] all
[47:00] so that he can draw you close to him and
[47:02] show you that he loves you
[47:04] I say I thank God that we serve a God
[47:07] Like That
[47:09] that doesn't let me go on in my own
[47:11] dreams go on in my own ways and go on
[47:13] but but anything that draws me away from
[47:16] God God is willing he's willing to break
[47:18] me to pull me back to him
[47:21] to show his love to me I say thank God
[47:23] for that
[47:27] amen
[47:29] brother Ben there's a quote here that I
[47:31] want to read really quick
[47:33] and the message I know
[47:35] says and why does God let troubles come
[47:38] God harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[47:41] mouth and makes it obey him and those
[47:43] troubles bring us into a closer
[47:45] fellowship with God
[47:47] there had been no rainbow until the
[47:49] flood came but after Noah was pressed
[47:51] into that condition that he was in to
[47:52] float 40 days and nights in a storm and
[47:55] the little Arc pitching up and down in
[47:56] the water it was after the flood was
[47:58] over that he saw the rainbow for its
[48:00] first time the Covenant of Hope the
[48:01] Covenant of Promise after he'd went
[48:04] through the tribulation then he saw the
[48:05] promise that's the way you see the
[48:08] Promise after you've gone through the
[48:09] tribulation I've liked that poem or
[48:12] Psalm must I be carried home to heaven
[48:14] on a flowery bed of ease While others
[48:16] fought to win the prize and sailed
[48:17] through bloody Seas
[48:19] we ask for comfort and peace and God
[48:21] gives us the best he could give us
[48:22] trials and tribulations that's better
[48:25] than comfort and peace our Comforts is
[48:28] just beyond the river
[48:30] how many of you know that Christ Is A
[48:32] Healer
[48:34] do you know it because you read it or do
[48:36] you know it because he healed you
[48:39] so God proved his word to you by
[48:42] allowing a sickness to come so that you
[48:44] would know personally him as a savior
[48:46] personally him as a Healer personally
[48:48] him as a redeemer
[48:53] maybe God would allow us to feel unloved
[48:56] so that we could feel his love
[48:58] maybe that God allow us to feel
[49:00] rejection so that we can know what his
[49:03] acceptance is
[49:04] maybe he would allow us to feel lonely
[49:07] so that he could come and be a comforter
[49:09] to us
[49:10] maybe all of these things are good for
[49:12] us
[49:13] maybe they they bring us into a closer
[49:15] fellowship with God
[49:18] that's what the prophet said
[49:20] he goes on to say it wasn't until the
[49:21] Hebrew children was forced into the
[49:23] fiery furnace on one of their most
[49:25] outstanding trials that they've seen one
[49:27] like the Son of God standing among them
[49:29] their troubles produced the son of God
[49:32] standing among them in the breezes to
[49:35] wave away the heat wave but not until
[49:37] they went into the fire did the
[49:39] comforter appear
[49:40] it was Daniel who had purposed in his
[49:42] heart that he not Define himself with
[49:44] the things of the world and was forced
[49:46] through a trial whether he'd pray to God
[49:47] or go to the Lion's Den
[49:49] but it was after the heat was put on and
[49:51] he was thrown into a lion's den that
[49:53] after that he saw the angel of the Lord
[49:55] standing in the midst of him keeping
[49:56] away the great Pillar of Fire standing
[49:58] between him and the lions
[50:00] and the Lions could not get him because
[50:02] he'd went through the trials and
[50:03] temptations and troubles he knew that
[50:05] his God was able to deliver him from
[50:07] then
[50:09] it was Abraham after he'd been after
[50:12] he'd seen the ground get Barren and the
[50:13] drought come and lots separate himself
[50:15] and go down to live deliciously into the
[50:17] world it was after he had heard the
[50:19] wines and cries of his herdsmen with no
[50:21] grass for his cattle but he maintained
[50:23] in the land that God gave him and told
[50:25] him to sojourn in and as on that day
[50:28] after he'd been tried till his patience
[50:30] was at the end it was on that day I love
[50:34] the way the prophet said that when his
[50:35] patience come to an end it was on that
[50:37] day not a day early not a day late but
[50:40] when he came to the end of his patience
[50:42] it was his patience was at the end it
[50:44] was on that day that when after the
[50:46] trial was over he spoke face to face
[50:48] with Elohim under the oak that day it
[50:51] was after he'd suffered his trials after
[50:52] he'd went through the troubles that he'd
[50:54] been through that God appeared to him in
[50:56] the form of a man and sat there and told
[50:58] him he was married and his wife's name
[51:00] was Sarah and said she laughed at him in
[51:02] the tent behind it was there that
[51:04] Abraham called him Elohim it was after
[51:06] the trial and tribulation
[51:09] oh if the church could only wake to
[51:11] itself today
[51:12] to find that after the troubles and
[51:14] trials and the laughs and made fun of
[51:16] and the things that the church has been
[51:18] through the Pentecostal church that we
[51:20] see God in our midst doing great signs
[51:23] and wonders
[51:24] it was after the scorning after the
[51:27] Laughing after the rejection after all
[51:29] of that we see God
[51:32] I say
[51:34] we shouldn't be
[51:36] so fearful
[51:38] of Trials
[51:41] amen
[51:45] this little quote I found that was quite
[51:47] interesting he said but after death
[51:49] Faith sees the resurrection
[51:52] a god of Resurrection That's The Power
[51:54] of Faith to believe when he asked
[51:56] standing over behind the Dark Cloud that
[51:58] you can't see with your natural eyes but
[52:00] Faith standing by you directs you to
[52:02] that God of resurrection and a God of
[52:04] all wisdom who was who has ordained our
[52:07] path he's standing just behind every
[52:10] trial
[52:11] where's he at he's behind the Dark Cloud
[52:13] that you can't see him with your natural
[52:15] life where is he standing behind every
[52:17] trial
[52:18] amen and that's why I don't think we
[52:21] should be so fearful of the trial
[52:23] because he's in the he's allowing a
[52:26] light to arise in the midst of Darkness
[52:28] amen out of the darkness the light is
[52:30] arising to the upright
[52:32] and the prophet says he's standing
[52:33] behind every trial I was when we were in
[52:36] the Philippines this last time I was
[52:38] speaking to uh brother Nestor and
[52:41] brother Nestor was made this statement
[52:43] and this is what I've been meditating on
[52:44] for a long time he said this statement
[52:46] he says I don't I'm going to get this
[52:49] right he says
[52:51] I don't
[52:53] dread you said dread or fear troubles
[52:57] coming to the church
[52:59] because I don't dread troubles coming to
[53:01] church he said I welcome them
[53:05] now up to this point I was like polar
[53:07] opposite
[53:10] he said every time Trouble Comes to the
[53:13] church something good happens
[53:15] and if you remember the last the one
[53:18] that he was talking about when brother
[53:20] brother Nestor came here the last time
[53:21] which is about four years ago I believe
[53:23] it was when he was here when he flew
[53:25] over here when he landed he found out
[53:28] that because of an earthquake they had
[53:29] right before he left amen that the
[53:32] engineer had come in and condemned the
[53:34] building that they had their Church on
[53:35] and where they had their church was also
[53:37] his home he had a home on the back side
[53:38] of the church
[53:40] and the engineer come and condemned it
[53:42] and gave him like 48 hours to vacate the
[53:44] premises and while brother Nestor was in
[53:47] the plane landed he got this news and
[53:49] found out they had no church and he was
[53:51] homeless all in a moment's time
[53:53] no church and homeless because of an
[53:56] earthquake
[53:57] and you say how could God
[54:00] allow that to happen to a church into a
[54:03] brother Nestor or somebody who
[54:05] sacrificed how could it happen but here
[54:07] we are four years later and they have
[54:09] another church amen that's better than
[54:11] the one that they had amen they had no
[54:13] parking now they have a whole parking
[54:14] lot
[54:16] they've got extra space that they can
[54:18] use when they have big meetings amen and
[54:20] brother Nestor has a home a beautiful
[54:22] home and he's never had a home since he
[54:25] entered the ministry he's never had his
[54:27] own home and now he has a home that he
[54:29] can entertain or a house 80 ministers in
[54:32] their lives when they come together for
[54:33] meetings
[54:35] and he's sitting there telling me this
[54:37] and this is a seasoned brother who's
[54:39] seen a lot and he says I don't dread
[54:42] troubles coming to church I welcome them
[54:44] because every time trouble is struck the
[54:46] church something good has happened
[54:48] and I said oh God I need an adjustment
[54:51] in my thinking
[54:53] and so I've been meditating on that for
[54:55] over a month and and then this this
[54:57] started coming together for me just in
[54:59] the last week then I began to realize
[55:01] that the things I've dreaded the most
[55:03] amen are when God showed himself
[55:05] mightiest on my behalf
[55:07] the darkest times in my life is when God
[55:10] has showed us himself Supernatural in my
[55:12] life
[55:13] it wasn't the good times it wasn't all
[55:16] the blessings amen I I thankful for all
[55:18] the blessings and all the good times but
[55:20] the times that I saw a living God come
[55:22] on the scene were some of the Darkest
[55:24] Hours of my life
[55:26] and some of the greatest testimonies I
[55:28] have come from the worst situations
[55:31] not from the best from the worst from
[55:34] the worst comes the best
[55:36] my greatest testimonies the greatest
[55:38] things I share amen the Fulfillment of
[55:40] scriptures and all these things come
[55:42] from trouble sometimes in my life
[55:44] sicknesses and darkness and family
[55:46] troubles and church troubles if out of
[55:49] that God has moved supernaturally and
[55:51] done things and I can testify over and
[55:53] over and over again of a mighty God who
[55:55] answers prayer and delivers and comes on
[55:57] the scene in the darkest of ours why
[55:59] because I was in dark hours and in
[56:01] trouble and in sick and in all kinds of
[56:03] situations
[56:05] I said God help me to get to that place
[56:07] where brother Nester is where I'm no
[56:10] longer dreading the things that are
[56:11] coming when we see the billowing clouds
[56:13] rolling and sometimes you can see a
[56:15] trial coming
[56:16] you ever been there you can just see
[56:18] it's getting ready to hit
[56:20] amen I want to see the Angels Wings a
[56:23] blessing in disguise
[56:25] I want to see how God is going to allow
[56:28] a light to arise in this Darkness I
[56:31] don't know the the Hebrew children
[56:33] didn't know Daniel didn't know amen but
[56:36] God knew
[56:38] and God knows for us
[56:40] and that's where I want to be
[56:44] amen I want to look at another aspect of
[56:47] this as we move forward
[56:50] in Jeremiah
[56:52] 29 and verse 10 he says for thus saith
[56:55] the Lord that after 70 years be
[56:57] accomplished at Babylon I will visit you
[57:00] and perform my good word towards you and
[57:03] causing you to return to this place for
[57:05] I know the thoughts that I think towards
[57:06] you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and
[57:09] not of evil to give you an expected end
[57:14] and I'd just like to say
[57:19] our life is not a random set of events
[57:27] our trials are not a random set of
[57:30] events
[57:32] but God said I know the plans I have
[57:35] towards you he's tearing Jeremiah before
[57:37] they're taken captive and carried to
[57:39] Babylon that he has a Time marker
[57:42] that you're going to enter this trial
[57:44] I'm allowing it to happen and it'll be
[57:47] for seven years and at the end of 70
[57:49] years I'm going to bring you out listen
[57:52] Jeremiah is not saying if you're good
[57:55] and behave yourself and I might think
[57:57] about it you might persuade me to change
[57:59] my mind amen God is saying I know when
[58:03] this trial will start and I know when
[58:04] this trial will end
[58:06] because I I know the thoughts that I
[58:09] think to you thoughts of good and not of
[58:12] evil they're getting ready to get
[58:13] carried captive Amen to a pagan culture
[58:17] in society under a pagan King taken from
[58:20] Jerusalem and Jerusalem sacked and
[58:21] destroyed and carried away to another
[58:23] land I mean he says I don't have
[58:25] thoughts of evil but I have thoughts of
[58:27] good towards you
[58:29] to bring you to an expected end
[58:32] I know the time that this will begin and
[58:36] I know the time that this will end
[58:39] breaks gone
[58:43] I want to look at Genesis chapter 50. I
[58:45] want to look at the lies of Joseph now
[58:46] with this in mind
[58:49] this is the end of Joseph's life this is
[58:51] after Jacob his father passes away he's
[58:54] saved his brother and they're all there
[58:55] with him in Egypt
[58:58] and they say they say so shall ye say
[59:00] unto Joseph this is his brothers forgive
[59:02] I pray thee now the trespass of thy
[59:04] Brethren and their sin for they did unto
[59:07] the evil and now we pray thee forgive
[59:10] the trespass of the Servants of God of
[59:12] thy father and Joseph wept when they
[59:14] spake unto him and his Brethren also
[59:17] went and fell down before his face and
[59:18] they said behold we be thy servants and
[59:21] Joseph said unto them fear not for I am
[59:24] in the place of God
[59:26] you haven't done anything to me I'm
[59:29] positioned by God
[59:32] but as for you you thought evil against
[59:36] me but God meant it unto good to bring
[59:40] to pass as it is this day to save much
[59:43] people alive
[59:45] they thought that they had they thought
[59:49] that by their wickedness they had dumped
[59:53] something horrible to their brother and
[59:55] their brother is standing there saying
[59:57] you meant it for evil that was your
[59:59] intention but there was another purpose
[1:00:02] behind it all and God meant it for good
[1:00:04] and I am in the position the place of
[1:00:07] God and you were only a tool that he
[1:00:09] used to work a work of evil because of
[1:00:11] your corrupt heart to bring about good
[1:00:13] and to get me in this position today
[1:00:16] so how can I be angry at you and kill
[1:00:19] you and have retribution listen there's
[1:00:22] going to be people who speak evil about
[1:00:24] you reject you say horrible things and
[1:00:26] maybe even do horrible things to you but
[1:00:28] praise God God is trying to get us in
[1:00:30] position
[1:00:33] and when we understand who we are and
[1:00:35] that nothing can happen in the life of a
[1:00:37] Believer unless God first approves of it
[1:00:39] and the clock is ticking right on time
[1:00:41] and everything has to be this way when
[1:00:43] we come to the realization of that
[1:00:45] nobody in this life is hurting you
[1:00:47] everybody is helping you
[1:00:50] every evil deed every Wicked happening I
[1:00:53] mean every underhanded deed every
[1:00:55] misconduct at work every that was
[1:00:58] helping you
[1:01:01] say how is that possible I don't know
[1:01:05] but it's possible
[1:01:07] look at the lives of Joseph
[1:01:09] brother Franco can you pull up the um
[1:01:11] whiteboard I want to look at something
[1:01:13] in the white on the Whiteboard for just
[1:01:15] a minute because I think it's super
[1:01:17] interesting if we go to Genesis 37 let's
[1:01:20] turn to Genesis 37 really quick
[1:01:27] sometimes I like a service like this to
[1:01:30] get her head screwed on straight
[1:01:34] because in this life as human beings we
[1:01:37] think the human thoughts are wrong
[1:01:40] God's thoughts are so much higher than
[1:01:42] our thoughts
[1:01:44] the human thinking is all upside down
[1:01:46] and backwards and the laodice and think
[1:01:48] he's completely contrary to God
[1:01:50] and sometimes we just need a
[1:01:52] old-fashioned Bible study and go back
[1:01:54] through some of these things to get our
[1:01:55] heads screwed back on straight
[1:01:57] so that we can think like God thinks and
[1:01:59] our thinking go to a higher level amen
[1:02:02] so so Genesis 37 verse
[1:02:06] 5.
[1:02:08] and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told
[1:02:11] it into his brethren
[1:02:13] and they hated him yet the more and he
[1:02:15] said unto them here I pray you this
[1:02:16] dream which I have dreamed for behold we
[1:02:19] were binding sheaves in the field and lo
[1:02:20] my chief arose and also stood upright
[1:02:23] and behold your sheep stood round about
[1:02:25] and made obescence to my sheep
[1:02:28] and his brother said unto him shout thou
[1:02:30] indeed Reign Over us our shalt thou
[1:02:33] indeed have dominion over us and they
[1:02:35] hated him yet the more for his dreams
[1:02:37] and for his words and he dreamed yet
[1:02:40] another dream and told it to his
[1:02:41] Brethren and said behold I have dreamed
[1:02:44] a dream more and behold the Sun and the
[1:02:46] Moon and the 11 stars made obesecence to
[1:02:49] me and he told it to his father and to
[1:02:51] his brother and then his father rebuked
[1:02:53] him and said in him what is this dream
[1:02:55] that thou has dreamed shall I and thy
[1:02:57] mother and thy Brethren indeed come to
[1:02:59] bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth
[1:03:01] and his Brethren envied him but his
[1:03:04] father observed the sayings
[1:03:07] here he comes with a dream and then the
[1:03:09] dream is a prophecy
[1:03:11] and the prophecy of Joseph rising to a
[1:03:14] position of power of authority and
[1:03:16] Dominion in his brothers bowing to him
[1:03:20] and you can see his brothers hated this
[1:03:22] dream because they didn't want to bow to
[1:03:24] Joseph so what they did what they
[1:03:27] intended to do is deal with Joseph so
[1:03:30] that the dream won't come to pass amen
[1:03:32] but you can't stop prophecy and you
[1:03:35] can't get somebody out of a god-given
[1:03:37] position all you can do by your actions
[1:03:39] is put them in position
[1:03:42] how can a man outdo God
[1:03:45] how can how can the efforts of human
[1:03:47] beings change the mind of God and change
[1:03:50] the position God wants to put somebody
[1:03:51] in so they in their own thinking are
[1:03:54] dealing with Joseph Joseph thinks he's
[1:03:56] going to rule over us well we'll just
[1:03:57] get rid of Joseph so that what he thinks
[1:03:59] will never come to pass the problem is
[1:04:01] it wasn't what Joseph thought it was a
[1:04:03] prophecy that was in Joseph's life and
[1:04:05] nothing was going to change that
[1:04:07] prophecy
[1:04:10] and so they sold him into slavery
[1:04:13] I think we have the white board up I
[1:04:15] want to I want to take a look at this
[1:04:18] I want to look at the path of the
[1:04:20] prophecy
[1:04:22] because it's super interesting to me
[1:04:23] when when the when the dream gives a
[1:04:26] prophecy the prophecy is him in Dominion
[1:04:29] him in authority and everybody bowing to
[1:04:32] him
[1:04:33] so the first thing that God does to
[1:04:35] bring the Fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:04:37] number one
[1:04:43] is rejection
[1:04:49] because God has got to get Joseph in
[1:04:52] position for the prophecy
[1:04:55] but I don't think Joseph thought step
[1:04:58] one was rejection
[1:05:02] do you
[1:05:06] then we come to step two
[1:05:10] in slip two is
[1:05:12] slavery
[1:05:15] which brings him to Potiphar's house
[1:05:20] right
[1:05:22] so in order to fulfill the prophecy
[1:05:26] God knows the plans that he has for
[1:05:30] Joseph
[1:05:31] plans of good and not of evil to bring
[1:05:33] an expected in
[1:05:36] in order to get Joseph in his
[1:05:39] predestinated position
[1:05:41] Step One is rejection
[1:05:44] step two is slavery bondage sold as a
[1:05:48] slave to potiphar then in Potiphar's
[1:05:50] house then he starts to rise now there's
[1:05:52] a rising of Joseph and Potiphar's house
[1:05:54] he's given responsibility he's given
[1:05:56] Authority he becomes the steward of
[1:05:58] Potiphar's house and potiphar is an
[1:06:00] official amen under Pharaoh amen so if
[1:06:03] you believe that his position next to
[1:06:06] Pharaoh is the destination then it looks
[1:06:09] like the plan of God is working working
[1:06:11] him close to the prophecy
[1:06:15] he's getting pretty close to the
[1:06:16] prophecy so as he gets closer and closer
[1:06:19] becomes a greater man and Potiphar's
[1:06:21] house so that potiphar doesn't even know
[1:06:23] his Daily Business he doesn't even know
[1:06:25] how much he has amen he's left all of
[1:06:27] that to Joseph Joseph's become a great
[1:06:28] man amen so we're going to come to step
[1:06:31] three
[1:06:34] is a false accusation
[1:06:40] I don't even know if that's spelled
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:43] a full false accusation so step three
[1:06:47] God allows a false accusation
[1:06:51] and and Joseph is pinned for a crime he
[1:06:55] never committed
[1:06:57] his reputation is ruined
[1:07:00] his name is slandered
[1:07:04] and this false accusation moves him to
[1:07:07] step four and step four is prison
[1:07:13] and and we have to think this is a man
[1:07:16] who starts with the destination in
[1:07:20] Prophecy he knows the end result he
[1:07:23] doesn't know the path there amen but
[1:07:25] everything that's happening to him is
[1:07:27] looking like it's moving away from the
[1:07:30] prophecy but not God knows the plan that
[1:07:33] he has the thoughts that he has for
[1:07:35] Joseph to bring him to an expected end
[1:07:38] and God knows just how long it'll take
[1:07:39] he knows how long he needs to be in this
[1:07:41] position he knows how he knows when to
[1:07:43] move him from this position to this
[1:07:45] position
[1:07:48] because God has a plan and the prophecy
[1:07:51] is not going to fail listen there's a
[1:07:53] prophecy in each one of our lives
[1:07:56] God has called us to manifest and
[1:07:58] manifest Bride In the End Time amen
[1:08:01] Christ in Bride form in your flesh and
[1:08:04] God wants that manifest and he knows the
[1:08:06] way he wants you to manifest it he knows
[1:08:08] how he wants you to declare the word and
[1:08:11] he knows what it's going to take to get
[1:08:12] each one of us into position for that
[1:08:14] manifestation
[1:08:16] but sometimes the first step is
[1:08:18] rejection
[1:08:20] was that your first step
[1:08:22] and receiving the word rejection amen
[1:08:25] amen so many times you go from rejection
[1:08:28] and then all of a sudden you go to the
[1:08:30] next phase and things start to get
[1:08:32] better and it looks like okay now I'm
[1:08:34] moving into this prophecy I'm becoming
[1:08:36] all that God wants me to be and God will
[1:08:39] absolutely Blindside us and do something
[1:08:42] we never saw coming and he allows Joseph
[1:08:44] to get be falsely accused of raping
[1:08:47] Potiphar's wife his name slander D Fame
[1:08:50] cast into prison forgot about and now it
[1:08:53] looks like the absolute death of the
[1:08:55] prophecy but Joseph didn't know I don't
[1:08:58] think anybody else know that that was
[1:09:00] the step that he needed to get right
[1:09:02] underneath the throne
[1:09:05] God was positioning him
[1:09:09] Potiphar's wife
[1:09:11] was trying to destroy Joseph
[1:09:15] the Potiphar's wife was pushing Joseph
[1:09:18] into position
[1:09:21] the people who have tried to destroy
[1:09:23] your reputation who slandered you and
[1:09:25] spoke evil of you they're trying to get
[1:09:28] rid of you destroy you or whatever hurts
[1:09:30] your reputation they have no idea the
[1:09:33] only thing that they can do is work into
[1:09:35] the plan of God and put you in a better
[1:09:37] position
[1:09:39] that's why I said sometimes I like
[1:09:41] services like this to get our head
[1:09:42] screwed on straight
[1:09:44] so we can say listen no weapon formed
[1:09:47] against me shall prosper
[1:09:50] No Lie is going to change what God wants
[1:09:53] to do in my life
[1:09:54] no amount of rejection no amount of
[1:09:56] being Cast Away lied about uh forsaken
[1:10:00] none of those things are going to change
[1:10:02] what God has already saw in my life
[1:10:04] everything must be working according to
[1:10:07] his plan what I need to do is not
[1:10:09] despair but lift my voice and praise God
[1:10:11] because I already know by a prophecy in
[1:10:15] this end time what my destination is I
[1:10:17] already know the prophecy
[1:10:19] I don't need to worry about all the
[1:10:21] steps God already has them mapped out
[1:10:23] and he knows when to move them God knows
[1:10:26] God knew oh my goodness God knew when it
[1:10:29] was time to take Joseph from Potiphar's
[1:10:31] house into prison and God would allow an
[1:10:34] evil spirit to start moving and
[1:10:36] Potiphar's wife so she would desire amen
[1:10:38] the wrong kind of relationship with
[1:10:40] Joseph Joseph had no desire for it amen
[1:10:43] it wasn't Joseph's fault he didn't do
[1:10:45] anything wrong
[1:10:48] but how else is God going to get Joseph
[1:10:50] in prison
[1:10:53] through a false accusation
[1:10:58] step number five
[1:11:00] from prison
[1:11:02] to throne
[1:11:05] nobody would have expected that
[1:11:09] nobody expected that the prison house
[1:11:12] the dungeon
[1:11:14] was the step he needed to get to the
[1:11:17] throne
[1:11:19] we thought maybe potiphar would
[1:11:21] introduce him and he would see how great
[1:11:23] he is and what great work he did for
[1:11:25] potiphar and then he would ask potiphar
[1:11:27] can he be my Steward and who knows
[1:11:30] but God doesn't think like you and I
[1:11:32] think
[1:11:33] amen God has to get him first God's got
[1:11:37] to get him in Egypt
[1:11:40] so what's the best way to get him in
[1:11:42] Egypt make his brothers hate him and
[1:11:43] make him sell him to a caravan
[1:11:45] that's going down to Egypt and they took
[1:11:47] him down to Egypt They Carried him down
[1:11:49] to Egypt you know those slave Traders
[1:11:51] weren't hurting Joseph one bit
[1:11:56] he was sold to slave Traders can Joseph
[1:11:59] get mad at the slave Traders
[1:12:02] he can't get mad at the slave Traders
[1:12:03] any more than get mad at his brethren
[1:12:06] any more than he could get mad at
[1:12:08] Potiphar's wife or potiphar
[1:12:12] because Joseph at the end of the story
[1:12:14] has come to a higher revelation
[1:12:17] and say it was all meant for evil but
[1:12:20] God meant it for good
[1:12:22] I am in the place of God
[1:12:27] amen nobody can put me in and nobody can
[1:12:31] take me out
[1:12:33] the only thing circumstances can do is
[1:12:36] push me into place and help me build
[1:12:38] character along the way
[1:12:40] that I'm going to need for the next
[1:12:42] stage in life
[1:12:44] every harmful thing somebody does to you
[1:12:47] don't don't let it destroy you amen make
[1:12:51] them Stepping Stones not stumbling
[1:12:53] stones
[1:12:54] and realize God's not forgotten about me
[1:12:57] he's not forgotten and it looks like
[1:12:59] things are going worse they're not going
[1:13:01] worse maybe worse is what you need to
[1:13:03] get right under the throne amen so when
[1:13:05] Pharaoh gets angry at his Butler and it
[1:13:09] is Baker
[1:13:10] why did Pharaoh get angry at the Butler
[1:13:12] and the baker he got angry at the butler
[1:13:14] in the baker because because Joseph was
[1:13:16] in prison
[1:13:20] and God sent them to prison amen
[1:13:23] remember there's a whole story behind it
[1:13:25] it doesn't matter the story the story
[1:13:26] what we need to know is Joseph's in
[1:13:29] prison he's got to get these two
[1:13:30] servants cast out in the prison then
[1:13:32] they have dreams and then there's an
[1:13:34] interpretation of the dreams then
[1:13:35] there's one restored there's one killed
[1:13:37] and and then at an appointed time listen
[1:13:40] Joseph was down there wasting away and
[1:13:43] he had one request he said when you are
[1:13:45] restored to Pharaoh would you please
[1:13:47] mention me to pharaoh
[1:13:50] and this man agrees he agrees I will
[1:13:53] mention you to Pharaoh amen and so now
[1:13:55] now guess what he does when he gets out
[1:13:58] and he gets restored he forgot what he
[1:14:01] promised Joseph
[1:14:04] the question is was he hurting Joseph
[1:14:07] was he forgetting
[1:14:09] was was his forgetting an offense or did
[1:14:12] it work into the plan
[1:14:15] because he forgot to mention Joseph
[1:14:17] because it wasn't time to mention Joseph
[1:14:20] but there would come a time that Pharaoh
[1:14:22] would have a dream and this dream would
[1:14:24] trouble pharaoh and trouble and Pharaoh
[1:14:27] troubled by this dream would now begin
[1:14:29] to ask is there anybody that can
[1:14:31] interpret the dream and ask his wise men
[1:14:32] and want to know what the meaning of the
[1:14:34] dream is and it's at that moment that
[1:14:37] this servant has an aha moment
[1:14:41] ah my Lord I forgot
[1:14:46] until just this convenient moment
[1:14:52] Joseph could be down there in prison
[1:14:54] going that guy he promised me
[1:14:58] he told me he would say what a dirty
[1:15:01] scoundrel he gets out I helped him and
[1:15:04] he doesn't even have enough kind
[1:15:06] courtesy to
[1:15:11] the Bible is written about real people
[1:15:13] in real situations
[1:15:15] but this is where we live amen and all
[1:15:18] of a sudden I don't need to get mad at
[1:15:19] the guy at work
[1:15:21] what I should do is send him a little
[1:15:22] thank you note
[1:15:26] the person is trying to slander hurt the
[1:15:29] reputation you should say thank you amen
[1:15:32] because if you're able to do that it
[1:15:33] must be because God wants it done
[1:15:37] or now we told a lie about you we
[1:15:39] falsely accuse you about something and
[1:15:41] now you've lost your job and you must
[1:15:42] say well if if I've lost my job God must
[1:15:45] be repositioning me so I need to send a
[1:15:48] thank you note to that that manager and
[1:15:50] that guy who lie that setup scheme that
[1:15:52] they set up I need to write them a
[1:15:54] little thank you note and say thank you
[1:15:56] amen because I know there's a prophecy
[1:15:58] in my life and nothing you can do can
[1:15:59] hurt me or move me outside of that
[1:16:01] prophecy if God allowed you to do it the
[1:16:03] only thing you can do is move me further
[1:16:05] into the prophecy
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:12] I say God help us to get our head
[1:16:15] screwed on strength
[1:16:17] not the Panic not to lose our mind not
[1:16:20] to lose our Revelation every time bad
[1:16:23] things happen but to recognize amen God
[1:16:26] I've got a prophecy in my life God has
[1:16:28] already showed me amen by the end time
[1:16:30] Vision who I am and what his plan is for
[1:16:33] me and that I'm going to reach I'm going
[1:16:36] to make I'm going to be there I will be
[1:16:39] manifesting bride I will take a body
[1:16:41] change these atoms will change I know
[1:16:43] that will happen how I get from here to
[1:16:46] there I don't know it may be a little up
[1:16:48] a little down a little sideways some
[1:16:49] backwards and forwards I don't know but
[1:16:51] I will get here
[1:16:53] and everything that happens has to be
[1:16:56] moving me here because God knows the
[1:16:58] thoughts he has towards me to bring me
[1:17:00] to this expected end
[1:17:04] but Frank if we could go back to the
[1:17:06] PowerPoint
[1:17:09] it's amazing how Jesus came and he came
[1:17:12] according to prophecy and as he was born
[1:17:14] amen he was rejected right from his
[1:17:16] birth because they didn't believe she
[1:17:18] was virgin they thought there was some
[1:17:19] funny business going on and right from
[1:17:21] the beginning he gets rejection but then
[1:17:23] he comes out with healing campaigns and
[1:17:25] it's like Joseph and Potiphar's house
[1:17:26] now he gets some he gets crowds gathered
[1:17:30] people loving him he gets all this going
[1:17:32] on until a woman makes a false
[1:17:34] accusation and that woman is the false
[1:17:36] Church
[1:17:38] and she makes a false accusation and
[1:17:40] that false accusation has Jesus on trial
[1:17:43] with the government because of a false
[1:17:45] accusation ruining his reputation
[1:17:47] smiting him amen and they kill him under
[1:17:50] capital punishment he goes into the
[1:17:52] prison house but praise God that's just
[1:17:55] the next step to the throne
[1:18:00] so if that's how Joseph's life is if
[1:18:02] that's how Jesus life is and how do you
[1:18:05] think our life's going to be
[1:18:09] I don't know I don't expect it to get a
[1:18:11] lot better
[1:18:15] I expect it
[1:18:17] to be the same way everybody else's was
[1:18:20] trial and tribulation all the way
[1:18:23] but by the grace of God everyone is
[1:18:25] pushing teaching gaining we're moving in
[1:18:29] the program of God
[1:18:33] I want to look at this picture here
[1:18:37] there's a quote that I'd like to read
[1:18:39] out of standing in the gap
[1:18:41] and we've been through standing in the
[1:18:43] Gap so much the message is one that
[1:18:44] means something to me in particular
[1:18:46] means a lot I believe brother Branham is
[1:18:48] so real in this message and he's
[1:18:50] explained so much
[1:18:52] but in the message standing in the Gap
[1:18:54] brother Branham is suffering himself
[1:18:57] with rejection
[1:18:59] he's preached the message he's come he's
[1:19:03] come to the third pool he's come to the
[1:19:04] opening of the word he's come to
[1:19:06] everything his ministry had been
[1:19:08] pointing to he comes to this great event
[1:19:10] of the opening of the seals and
[1:19:12] afterwards he suffered rejection nobody
[1:19:15] would hear what he had to say nobody
[1:19:17] understood what he was preaching and he
[1:19:18] was being rejected for what he said and
[1:19:21] he himself is suffering under the
[1:19:22] rejection and he wants he wants to to to
[1:19:26] run away he wants to go up and be a
[1:19:28] guide and he wants to go help Bud
[1:19:29] Southwick and we know the story so well
[1:19:31] but but along then before that he starts
[1:19:34] having this dream that he's trying to
[1:19:36] find his brother-in-law who's who's an
[1:19:38] alcoholic and a bum and and he sees
[1:19:40] himself as a bomb and and he goes
[1:19:42] through all of this and he goes into the
[1:19:44] restaurant and in the restaurant he sees
[1:19:46] the mountain man who he he admires and
[1:19:48] he wants to be like him and and he keeps
[1:19:50] working this plan he wants to get away
[1:19:52] from the people away from the rejection
[1:19:53] nobody heard his message he wants to run
[1:19:55] away
[1:19:57] and so under this suffering of this
[1:19:59] trial
[1:20:00] he he sees these two men that look like
[1:20:03] him and Fletcher Broyhill Fletcher boy
[1:20:07] and and all of this takes place and he
[1:20:09] starts driving down the road
[1:20:11] I just love this story we've talked
[1:20:14] about it before but it just pay close
[1:20:15] attention
[1:20:18] God was going to show this mountain
[1:20:20] range to brother branna
[1:20:23] and God was going to tell him that your
[1:20:25] name is written in that mountain range
[1:20:28] and that mountain range explains your
[1:20:30] life
[1:20:32] the story of your life is in that
[1:20:34] mountain range your name is on that
[1:20:36] mountain range
[1:20:38] and that mountain range is right there
[1:20:39] in a specific spot it's there it's been
[1:20:42] there for a long time it didn't just
[1:20:44] move there that day
[1:20:47] and God before the foundation of the
[1:20:49] world God had to know that he was going
[1:20:53] to have a prophet suffering under
[1:20:56] rejection having need of encouragement
[1:20:58] and a revelation at a specific point in
[1:21:01] time at a specific spot on the map
[1:21:06] and he had to prepare this sign how many
[1:21:10] thousands or millions of years before
[1:21:12] Amen in a certain spot because he knew
[1:21:16] by his foreign knowledge that there's
[1:21:17] going to be a certain trial strike my
[1:21:19] prophet and he needs a certain
[1:21:21] encouragement at a certain place on the
[1:21:25] map at a certain point in time
[1:21:32] and how in the world can we think that
[1:21:35] when we get into a trial God doesn't
[1:21:37] know where we're at
[1:21:39] and God doesn't know what we're
[1:21:40] happening and what is happening gone and
[1:21:42] don't you know and we say things and I
[1:21:45] say them too I say things like God don't
[1:21:47] you see what I'm going through
[1:21:49] and it's laughable when we sit here in
[1:21:51] this context it's laughable but under
[1:21:53] despair under the trial under the agony
[1:21:55] we begin to cry out God don't you see
[1:21:57] what I'm going through we like to we're
[1:21:59] like the uh the the disciples in the
[1:22:02] boat don't you care that we perish
[1:22:07] but did he care yes he cared did he know
[1:22:09] yes he known did he know that his
[1:22:12] Prophet Hey listen this Prophet had a
[1:22:14] Monumental job to do
[1:22:17] so God was going to provide him
[1:22:19] Monumental encouragement
[1:22:22] says in the message standing in the Gap
[1:22:25] he's driving along
[1:22:27] he said as in Billy and I started on
[1:22:28] down the road we started going on down
[1:22:30] the road Billy went to sleep again
[1:22:33] and and it said the voices speaking to
[1:22:35] him said I'll give you an everlasting
[1:22:37] sign
[1:22:39] I said Lord what I waited a little bit
[1:22:42] and nothing happened
[1:22:43] I said what is the Everlasting sign Lord
[1:22:46] and I waited a few minutes and just in I
[1:22:48] looked over to see Billy he was asleep
[1:22:50] and he said I'll give you an everlasting
[1:22:53] sign again he said look Westford from
[1:22:55] where you're at
[1:22:57] I turned my head like this in the truck
[1:22:58] to look slowly down you know and oh my
[1:23:01] the spirit of the Lord I felt like I
[1:23:03] could scream and cry and I looked and I
[1:23:05] just saw a mountain with white caps on
[1:23:06] it and I said I don't know see no I
[1:23:09] don't know I don't see no Everlasting
[1:23:11] sign about that
[1:23:13] and he said your name is wrote all over
[1:23:16] it
[1:23:18] I stopped and I looked up on the
[1:23:20] mountain and I seen those Seven Hills
[1:23:22] now here if you want to see something
[1:23:24] there was Seven Peaks on top of a
[1:23:26] mountain one mountain that ran for
[1:23:27] several miles the last Mountain before
[1:23:29] you go into the other country no more
[1:23:30] Mountains after that and it was running
[1:23:32] from east to west the mountain set and
[1:23:34] it was snow-capped on top
[1:23:36] the first two small Peaks and then a
[1:23:38] larger Peak and then another small Peak
[1:23:40] then a larger Peak than a small Peak
[1:23:42] than a great large Long snow-capped
[1:23:44] Mountain and I said Lord I do not
[1:23:46] understand what that means
[1:23:48] he said how many Peaks are there I said
[1:23:51] they're seven I said how many letters in
[1:23:53] your name
[1:23:54] God is directing him right to this
[1:23:58] he said b-r-a-n-h-a-m
[1:24:01] that's seven if you're counting
[1:24:05] m-a-r-r-i-o-n-7 b-r-a-n-h-a-m-7
[1:24:11] and there was three outstanding Peaks
[1:24:14] he said those three Peaks are the first
[1:24:16] second third pool
[1:24:18] the first one was your first part of
[1:24:19] your ministry small hill then your first
[1:24:22] pull pretty high you know signing the
[1:24:24] hand then there was a little interval in
[1:24:25] there the time that I was taken off from
[1:24:27] being too tired many of you remember it
[1:24:30] and then come to discernment the second
[1:24:32] poem now I I've had another about a few
[1:24:34] years here of just kind of little Peaks
[1:24:36] see back like my Ministry wasn't yet and
[1:24:38] then come the third one
[1:24:40] three is a number of completions see the
[1:24:42] third one the next Peak was five number
[1:24:44] of Grace then the next Peak was seven
[1:24:45] the number of perfection in the end
[1:24:48] sixth day shall you labor the seventh is
[1:24:49] the Sabbath the end of the week the End
[1:24:51] of Time see and I stopped and I showed
[1:24:53] it to Billy and I looked at them and he
[1:24:56] said let that stand if there's ever a
[1:24:59] doubt in your mind remember this place
[1:25:01] and come back here
[1:25:05] everyone looked at this and he's he
[1:25:06] starts the god starts to describe this
[1:25:09] to him
[1:25:10] see you've worked up your ministry and
[1:25:12] you come to your first he said the first
[1:25:13] second third puller there
[1:25:16] before brother Branham ever knew that
[1:25:18] there was three portals in the ministry
[1:25:19] that mountain was there
[1:25:21] was three polls written in his life
[1:25:23] before he was ever born there was three
[1:25:25] pools on that mountain
[1:25:28] he didn't manufacture those he didn't
[1:25:30] produce those
[1:25:31] they were already written in the
[1:25:33] mountain
[1:25:37] then he says there's a little interval
[1:25:40] between the first and second he said
[1:25:42] that's the time that I was taken off the
[1:25:43] field for being too tired
[1:25:47] guess what it was already in the
[1:25:50] mountain
[1:25:51] God knew he would leave the field being
[1:25:54] too tired
[1:25:56] God already had the Peaks and already
[1:26:00] had the valleys and how high the peak
[1:26:03] how low the valley the next big the
[1:26:06] spacing between the Peaks is it was all
[1:26:09] his life was written in stone before he
[1:26:12] was born
[1:26:15] you think gone now let me let me ask you
[1:26:18] this
[1:26:19] God wrote that in stone knew the life
[1:26:23] story of the Prophet Knew by
[1:26:25] foreknowledge what was going to happen
[1:26:26] where the Peaks were The Valleys where
[1:26:28] where the three pools he had it all
[1:26:30] written there his name was on he knew
[1:26:32] what he would be named
[1:26:34] he knew it would have seven letters
[1:26:36] he wrote it all out there
[1:26:39] do you think God changed anything in
[1:26:43] that prophet's life
[1:26:46] he'd have to rearrange the mountains
[1:26:50] do you think God was surprised
[1:26:53] and disappointed at the valley
[1:26:58] do you think God would come to brother
[1:27:00] Branham and brother branham's too tired
[1:27:01] and taken off the field and you think
[1:27:02] brother remember go I'm surprised in you
[1:27:08] God already knew
[1:27:10] God already knew
[1:27:14] we've hit valleys we've hit frustrations
[1:27:16] we've had Peaks we've had highs we've
[1:27:18] had lows
[1:27:20] do you think God didn't know
[1:27:23] anything God's going to come to you
[1:27:25] through your values I'm just really
[1:27:26] disappointed in you
[1:27:28] God already knew your valleys he already
[1:27:31] knew your whole highs your lows your
[1:27:33] setbacks God already knew amen before
[1:27:36] the foundation of the world God has even
[1:27:38] ordained our trials
[1:27:43] when it comes down to the end of it the
[1:27:45] only thing we can say is thank you God
[1:27:48] I can't run my own life I can't figure
[1:27:51] out whether I'm up or down I don't know
[1:27:53] if I'm in a valley going into one coming
[1:27:54] out of one on a sometimes I have no idea
[1:27:57] where I'm at in life but God knows
[1:27:58] exactly where I'm at in life
[1:28:01] sometimes I don't trust my own thinking
[1:28:03] I don't trust my own emotions I don't
[1:28:04] know what's happening inside of me I
[1:28:06] don't know what's happening around me
[1:28:07] but one thing's for sure God knows the
[1:28:09] thoughts he has towards me and I'm
[1:28:11] coming to the expected end
[1:28:15] and I may not it may not look pretty
[1:28:18] I may not do it in Grand fashion but
[1:28:21] it's already spelled out
[1:28:23] and I'm going to get there and there's
[1:28:25] nothing anybody can do
[1:28:28] to change God's mind about me
[1:28:31] there's nothing I can do to change God's
[1:28:33] mind about me he's already wrote it do
[1:28:36] you think
[1:28:37] listen do you think when brother Brenham
[1:28:39] left to feel too tired weary he was
[1:28:41] having a nervous breakdown his nerves
[1:28:43] were on edge I meant and he was weeping
[1:28:44] and he was laying in bed he was sleeping
[1:28:46] and he was tired do you think God was
[1:28:48] going oh man I've got a plan for him I
[1:28:50] hope he gets back out there
[1:28:54] I hope he gets his act together
[1:28:57] because I need him
[1:29:02] why is it so easy to believe this about
[1:29:04] Joseph and about William Brandon but not
[1:29:06] about us
[1:29:08] we believe it wholeheartedly about
[1:29:10] William brand we believe it
[1:29:11] wholeheartedly about Joseph but when it
[1:29:12] comes to us but yeah brother Chad but
[1:29:14] you don't know I did this I did that
[1:29:15] listen
[1:29:18] I'm so thankful God gave us a life of a
[1:29:20] prophet on display
[1:29:22] that he could tell us that his Goods his
[1:29:24] bads what he did right what he did wrong
[1:29:26] the mistakes he made he even the angel
[1:29:28] even rebuked him for the way he was
[1:29:30] having healing campaigns because he was
[1:29:32] wearing himself out
[1:29:34] it was even his fault that he went into
[1:29:36] the valley
[1:29:37] but God knew it
[1:29:39] beforehand
[1:29:41] let's say God he knew his tent would get
[1:29:45] stolen from him he knew his friends
[1:29:46] would reject him he knew the
[1:29:47] Pentecostals would turn their back on
[1:29:49] him
[1:29:52] but guess what
[1:29:54] nothing ever moved him out of his
[1:29:57] position
[1:29:58] everything was putting him into position
[1:30:00] until he come to that third pool and if
[1:30:02] you look at that third pull brother bam
[1:30:04] talks about it he says that one then
[1:30:06] there's none after that that one just
[1:30:08] moves off into eternity
[1:30:11] brother man can look at that and he
[1:30:13] knows after the opening of the seals
[1:30:15] after the opening of the word the third
[1:30:16] pull of his ministry he's not looking
[1:30:18] for another Peak he's not looking for
[1:30:21] another amen he's going to move that
[1:30:23] Peak that third pull the opening of the
[1:30:25] word that's it that's the climax that's
[1:30:28] the end that'll move off into eternity
[1:30:32] um
[1:30:33] and God took his Prophet home two years
[1:30:37] after the opening of the seals because
[1:30:39] the third pool
[1:30:41] was the last peak in his life
[1:30:43] and that would move off into eternity it
[1:30:47] was already written
[1:30:49] I say if God can do it for Joseph and
[1:30:51] God can do for William Branham God has
[1:30:53] done it for me
[1:30:54] by faith I believe that God has already
[1:30:57] knows the thoughts that he has towards
[1:30:59] me and everything that happens is moving
[1:31:01] me into my position
[1:31:03] do I understand it all no
[1:31:05] I doubt Joseph understood it all and we
[1:31:08] know for sure brother Birmingham didn't
[1:31:09] understand it all
[1:31:11] that's why we don't understand it all
[1:31:13] but I said God help me think about life
[1:31:17] the way you think about my life
[1:31:20] give me I Salve to rub in my eyes so
[1:31:23] that I look at circumstances different
[1:31:25] than I looked at them before this isn't
[1:31:27] somebody trying to destroy me this is
[1:31:29] God using a tool to move me
[1:31:32] is gone
[1:31:34] this is going to read just a couple more
[1:31:35] quotes and we'll finish
[1:31:38] and super sign he said God knows the end
[1:31:41] from the beginning therefore he could
[1:31:42] plan everything
[1:31:44] do we believe that
[1:31:47] that it would work out just to his glory
[1:31:49] and that gives us courage to know that
[1:31:52] no matter what comes or goes God is
[1:31:53] making everything the clock is ticking
[1:31:55] just exactly on time
[1:31:57] sometimes we get weary upset we get
[1:32:00] hastily we think oh we must do this or
[1:32:03] do that but remember God's clock will be
[1:32:05] just exactly on time all these things
[1:32:09] has to be this way it has to all be done
[1:32:12] according to this great knowledge his
[1:32:13] foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he
[1:32:16] could predestinate not by his desire but
[1:32:18] by his knowledge God doesn't
[1:32:19] predestinate by his desire he's not
[1:32:21] willing that any should perish
[1:32:23] but his foreknowledge he knew who would
[1:32:25] accept it and who would not therefore he
[1:32:28] can make everything work according to
[1:32:29] his big time clock that's ticking away
[1:32:31] for he could foretell the end from the
[1:32:33] beginning and therefore he knew that we
[1:32:36] would live in this day he knew that this
[1:32:38] would be our day he had plans for this
[1:32:41] day he has plans for every day and never
[1:32:43] has one of his plans ever failed he is
[1:32:46] always on time
[1:32:48] I want to say Amen to that I believe
[1:32:51] that
[1:32:52] about me
[1:32:53] do you believe it about you
[1:32:56] we believe it because the prophet said
[1:32:58] it we saw it work out in his life but I
[1:33:00] want to believe it about me
[1:33:04] that he allows even my mistakes to work
[1:33:07] together for his glory
[1:33:09] do I make mistakes yes do I suffer from
[1:33:10] yes am I sorry for him yes but he'll
[1:33:13] allow even my mistakes to work together
[1:33:15] for his glory
[1:33:17] because he has a plan and he wasn't
[1:33:19] waiting for me to make my plan before he
[1:33:21] made his plan
[1:33:26] now I want to finish with this thought
[1:33:28] so this world is falling apart
[1:33:31] let her fall apart
[1:33:33] that's all right it's going to do it
[1:33:35] anyhow
[1:33:38] this world is falling apart
[1:33:40] the more it fall apart the more it'll
[1:33:43] push you in position
[1:33:45] the closer tragedy strikes and the more
[1:33:48] difficult circumstances get the only
[1:33:51] thing an economic collapse what can it
[1:33:53] do put you in position
[1:33:55] a government collapse puts you in
[1:33:57] position
[1:33:59] War breakout on your doorsteps put you
[1:34:01] in position
[1:34:02] I mean all the businesses close down put
[1:34:04] you nothing can happen that will not put
[1:34:07] you in God's position
[1:34:09] the world is falling apart brother
[1:34:11] members that let her fall apart we're
[1:34:13] not here to save the world
[1:34:15] the world is destined to collapse
[1:34:20] now look at this quote
[1:34:23] oh if you would only see it it was the
[1:34:26] waters that destroyed the world
[1:34:28] but it was the same Waters that saved
[1:34:30] Noah
[1:34:31] and also save the whole earth for Noah
[1:34:38] I just want to say atomic fire is about
[1:34:40] to fall
[1:34:43] but the same atomic fire that's about to
[1:34:45] fall is going to be you're in my
[1:34:48] salvation because God will pluck us off
[1:34:49] of here before that happens
[1:34:52] and the fire that falls will be what
[1:34:55] saves us because we're already
[1:34:56] dark in Christ
[1:34:59] and before the fire falls the atomic
[1:35:02] fire falls on the earth God is going to
[1:35:04] take us in a body change and a
[1:35:05] transition to another place amen and
[1:35:08] then the fire is going to save the whole
[1:35:10] earth for you and I
[1:35:13] nothing that North Korea is doing is
[1:35:16] hurting us
[1:35:17] nothing that that Russia is doing is
[1:35:20] hurting us nothing that anybody is doing
[1:35:23] is hurting us nothing that Iran is doing
[1:35:25] is hurting us everything that the world
[1:35:27] is doing is putting us into our
[1:35:29] prophetic position
[1:35:32] and now the news should not scare us
[1:35:36] now it doesn't mean we shouldn't be
[1:35:37] scared for loved ones and worried about
[1:35:39] those we care about we can't help those
[1:35:41] things but for us individually nothing
[1:35:43] no weapon formed against me can prosper
[1:35:46] nobody else can have another plan that
[1:35:47] trumps God plan and nobody can move me
[1:35:49] away from God's plan
[1:35:52] everything that's happening everything
[1:35:54] that's going to happen what's happening
[1:35:56] now and what happens next the next law
[1:35:58] that changes is not going to disrupt you
[1:36:00] it's going to put you in position
[1:36:03] I'll say it this way when brother Brown
[1:36:04] told us that they're going to close the
[1:36:06] doors of these churches closing the door
[1:36:07] to these churches will not hurt the
[1:36:09] bride one drop it'll put her in position
[1:36:13] whether we're here for it or not for
[1:36:15] here for it I don't know everything
[1:36:16] that's going to happen I don't claim to
[1:36:17] know what's going to happen but nothing
[1:36:19] that happens they change the law if they
[1:36:21] begin to tighten up things in religious
[1:36:23] circles it's not hurting
[1:36:25] we're not scared
[1:36:28] right
[1:36:29] I say God
[1:36:31] whatever
[1:36:33] happens
[1:36:35] help me to keep one thing in my mind and
[1:36:37] in my heart above everything else
[1:36:40] and that is you know the thoughts that
[1:36:43] you have towards me
[1:36:45] thoughts of good and not of evil to
[1:36:49] bring me to an expected end
[1:36:51] before Nebuchadnezzar's Army marched
[1:36:54] into Jerusalem he told Jeremiah I know
[1:36:57] the thoughts that I have
[1:36:59] it looks evil but most thoughts are not
[1:37:01] evil they're good
[1:37:02] to bring you to expect it in and after
[1:37:04] 70 years your this trial has a starting
[1:37:07] date this trial has an ending there
[1:37:11] and I trust that God
[1:37:14] the god of the Bible
[1:37:16] let's all stand
[1:37:20] the falling apart of the world
[1:37:23] is the Deliverance of the Bride
[1:37:26] the purging of the Earth by fire is a
[1:37:29] preparation for a honeymoon
[1:37:32] thank God musicians if you please come
[1:37:35] brother John this power had some prey
[1:37:38] dear Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:37:41] God there's so many wonderful truths
[1:37:43] that you have told us in your word
[1:37:45] God these truths are so beyond the human
[1:37:49] scope of imagination
[1:37:51] they're so beyond our normal realm of
[1:37:53] thinking that God we must be constantly
[1:37:56] reminded of these things
[1:37:58] Lord I Thank You Lord that you've placed
[1:38:00] them in the message you wrote them in
[1:38:02] your Bible Lord to give us this
[1:38:04] encouragement that we need
[1:38:06] Lord we don't know exactly what we're
[1:38:08] facing in the months and years to come
[1:38:11] we don't know exactly how dark it'll get
[1:38:13] it's dark
[1:38:14] but it'll get darker
[1:38:16] we don't know how dark it'll be we don't
[1:38:19] know what must happen we don't know all
[1:38:22] the things that will transpire but God
[1:38:24] we don't really need to know
[1:38:27] what we need to know you've already told
[1:38:29] us
[1:38:30] that you know the way I take
[1:38:33] and when I've been tried I shall come
[1:38:34] forth as gold
[1:38:36] Lord I'm trusting in you with all of my
[1:38:39] heart I pray God that you would give us
[1:38:40] your mind the mind of Christ the
[1:38:43] revelation of your word and may it push
[1:38:45] out every other thought Lord every
[1:38:47] thought that's contrary every fear and
[1:38:49] anxiety may you move it away from us
[1:38:52] Lord it may Faith take its place
[1:38:54] God may we walk with confidence in this
[1:38:57] world knowing that you have a plan for
[1:38:59] each of our lives and nothing nothing
[1:39:03] nothing nothing
[1:39:05] will move us out of your plan no power
[1:39:07] that anybody else has no scheme that
[1:39:10] anybody else can scheme up will change
[1:39:12] the direction you're moving us in
[1:39:15] God help us to relax
[1:39:18] Trust
[1:39:19] to have faith in the midst of Darkness
[1:39:22] God forgive us Lord for
[1:39:25] Lord are our emotions forgive us for
[1:39:28] allowing the emotions to rule
[1:39:30] bring us to a higher level of faith
[1:39:34] may we walk like you would walk in this
[1:39:36] life
[1:39:37] Lord Jesus when you were walking you
[1:39:39] weren't nervous
[1:39:40] you weren't scared
[1:39:43] in the face of trials in the face of
[1:39:45] moms who wanted to Stone you you weren't
[1:39:47] afraid
[1:39:48] is storms that threaten your life you
[1:39:50] were not afraid
[1:39:51] and trials and imprisonment
[1:39:55] even in crucifixion
[1:39:57] are you faced it knowing god had a plan
[1:40:01] you had a plan Lord that you were
[1:40:03] working your plan saving
[1:40:06] your people
[1:40:08] Lord I pray that you'd help us to walk
[1:40:10] in this life as you walk
[1:40:12] that you would grant us a higher level
[1:40:14] of Faith than we've ever operated by
[1:40:16] before
[1:40:17] Lord as you unveil your plan and unveil
[1:40:20] your word and constantly remind us of
[1:40:21] your word May the hearing of the word
[1:40:24] bring Faith
[1:40:26] maybe you said Faith cometh by hearing
[1:40:28] and hearing by the word May the constant
[1:40:30] hearing of this word bring us to that
[1:40:32] level of faith we need to operate

[1:40:40] this evening and go home May these
[1:40:42] things that we heard may they resonate
[1:40:44] within and may we ruminate upon them may
[1:40:47] they become part of us as we digest it

[1:40:51] life

[1:40:55] us your grace in our lives to manifest
[1:40:58] itself as we walk in this Dark World
