========================================

We just think we're a lump of coal and no value to us. And you know the only difference between those they got the same makeup. [Music] One just was elected. One was predetermined that when the pressures and strains of life, all of that coal, that coal, right, that piece of coal that's right beside that diamond was under the same pressure. Wasn't like it was a piece of coal 5 miles away and one over here. But however that happened, there was a predestinated predetermined moment where that diamond, that lump of coal would have transforming power and it would spark and the fire would ignite in that lump of coal and it'd be transformed into a diamond. And you know that diamond can dance and shout and run the aisles and say, "I'm a diamond. I'm no longer a lump of coal. But you know what? There's still more work to be done &gt;&gt; cuz there's fire inside that diamond that needs to be unlocked. But you know what happens? It's going to take a wise master builder, &gt;&gt; the chief jeweler &gt;&gt; to look at that diamond and flip it this way and flip it that way and go, you know what? I see this particular. It needs to be cut here and honed here and because it can look inside and see the fire inside that needs unlocked, &gt;&gt; but it's got to be honed and chiseled and sliced and diced. And it may be this big, but there's a whole lot of imperfections that that jeweler looks at and sees and goes, "Nope, that's got to go." And that great big diamond can end up being a little itty bitty teensy thing. &gt;&gt; But the reason why is because it was just that little itty bitty teensy piece that was perfection of perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so all of the they call them inclusions. All of you sisters know what I mean like. Amen. Right. All them inclusions had to because you want that perfect diamond. You want that fire to sparkle when he puts it on the hand. [Music] See, everything's got to be cut off. And I hope I hope you let the Lord cut some things off for you this morning because God's got a purpose in it. He He's He's not here to destroy us. He's here to love us. He's here to nurture us and make us his own. If we'll get on the potter's wheel, if we'll listen to his voice and hear his touch, can we do it this morning? Brother Brandham says, he says, "Listen, brother, you're never saved by any sign. You're never saved by any sensation. You are saved when you met God's condition of his word, and nothing else are you saved by." You say, "Brother Gabe, I the way you're saying is cutting me, and I don't feel saved. It's not by feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, you said, "Brother Gab, you preaching on touch and feel." That's exactly right. But I'm not talking about this. I'm talking about those tenderhearted, inward yearning boughs of mercy because your feelings is going to you'll have you'll be on a mountaintop one day and a valley the next. And brother Brandham tells us, he says, "You're saved because you met God's conditions." He says, "That's right. God's word is made a way. You're not saved because you feel like you're saved. I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved." Cuz a lot of times I don't feel that way. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. Yeah. And you young ones need to understand that cuz there's going to be valleys. There's going to be pitfalls. There's going to be backslidings. There's going to be downsittings. There's going to be uprisings. But through it all, you have to rest in the fact that you met God's requirements. You felt the prick of your heart. You heeded to it. You was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin. And you received the gift of the Holy Ghost cuz the promise was unto you.
