TRANSCRIPT
========================================
while joseph says i am joseph he is revealing himself but while he is revealing himself his family is revealed automatically because while he says i'm joseph they know who they are we're his brothers look for example joseph would go to any kind of an egyptian egyptian uh uh egyptian janitor in his palace or to any kind of an egyptian prince he would go before he says i am joseph and the man said huh but he goes to his brothers and says i am joseph and the brother said and we are his brothers you get it why joseph the revelation of jesus christ is the revelation of his bride while he is revealing himself the bride knows that i'm part of it hey [Applause] nobody in the garden of eden could tell if who she is eve could say mr elephant um can you tell me from where i come and he says the elephant said look uh it's it's wonderful here it's perfect but i don't know where i'm what i'm doing here honestly honestly just nice and the only one who could reveal to eve who she is was adam and the only one who can reveal to the bride who she is is the bright room while he is by he says who is this melchizedek the bride knows ho speaks of me amen amen who is this jesus oh i it tells me something it's the right amen can you say amen now joseph could just go even go to pharaoh pharaoh knew a lot of things pharaoh was strong in wikipedia honestly the whole day nothing nothing else to do just wikipedia just searching but joseph could come and say pharaoh joseph and pharah would have said so what he because he was not part of the family but when he said to his brothers he didn't say you are this you are this he says i am joseph and everybody in the family said oh can we a part of it can you say amen this is what this message does with us it shows us our true identity we are born with a purpose god sent us into this earth and this messenger took away our our spiritual amnesia
