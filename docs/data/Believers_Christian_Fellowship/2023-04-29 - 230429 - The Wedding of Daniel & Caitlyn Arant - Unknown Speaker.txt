Union that is between Christ and his church it is commended in the scripture to be honorable among all and therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly but reverently discreetly advisedly soberly and in the fear of God and to this holy estate these two persons come now to be joined we have gathered his family and friends of this man and this woman to lend our support and Good Will to this Union who will give this woman to be married to this man father and her mother you can be seated Daniel Aaron will you take Caitlin Williams to be your wedded wife to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony will you love her comfort her honor and keep her and sickness and in health forsaking all others keep yourself only unto her so long as you both shall live I will Caitlin Williams will you take Daniel Aaron to be your wedded husband to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony will you love him comfort him honor and obey him in sickness and in health forsaking all others keep yourself only unto him so long as you both shall live I will and then let's all bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this privilege to be here today God each one of us that are here we count it Lord to be a privilege to see what you have done in the lives of our brother Daniel and sister Caitlyn now you've brought him to this time and God surely you force all this time before the foundation of the world and knew that they would be joined as husband and wife I pray God everything we do would be pleasing to you and God that you would bless the ceremony would bless all our efforts in this uniting in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen as we look at marriage we see it's a major theme in the Bible and every time we come to a wedding it's such a wonderful opportunity to review Once Again the things that God has laid in the scriptures for us concerning marriage for it is the great mystery contained throughout the entire scripture we find it first in Genesis when God in the beginning forms the world and creates as Eden and he makes a son and places a son to rule over Eden but then God himself decrees that it is not good that man shall dwell alone I will make a help meet for him so it was God who who presented the first wife to his son so out from Adam he pulls a rib and he takes the feminine spirit and he forms the woman and unites the two together in what we see in the scriptures is the first marriage and the first marriage was performed by God it was instituted by God and it becomes the first of all human institutions so God designed marriage it was God's idea and God's concept therefore marriage is not man's idea but God's therefore man cannot manipulate it to his purpose man cannot change it to suit his needs or his desire Amen to understand marriage you have to go to the original and it was designed and instituted by God himself amen and God was foreshadowing in this something that he would do throughout all of scripture then we we see that later on as we go through scripture he chooses Abraham of all the people in the earth he comes and chooses Abraham and makes a promise to him and to his seat after him that he would he would be their God and they would be his people and we know that he redeems the Mount of Egypt and he brings them to himself and in the book of Jeremiah he says that I have become a husband to Israel I am married to Israel and God wanted a people to be United with him and we know that this people failed to keep their Covenant the Covenant that they accepted at Mount Sinai they failed and they broke but that didn't stop God's purpose for later we find in the New Testament that he once again is choosing a bride amen of his choice through the New Testament now he's selecting a gentile bride amen and we find that all the way at the end in the Book of Revelation we find the term bride appearing again for the bride hath made herself ready we find that there's a wife at the end and that wife is the Lamb's bride and we know that the marriage of the Lamb has come so we find that marriage is a theme from beginning to end in the scriptures it's important to God and therein lies a great mystery So today we're going to have a tradition that sister Caitlyn and brother Daniel have requested they would like to Performance an old tradition in which at some portion in the ceremony Caitlyn sister Caitlin will take a portion of her veil and she will drape it over the shoulder of her brother Daniel and in doing so she will signify that she is giving herself to this man that all she is she's entrusting to him and she's signifying that by the placing of the veil over her shoulder as Daniel lends his shoulder for this Veil and accepts the veil he's accepting responsibility for this woman to care for her and to keep her for the rest of her life so it's a wonderful tradition and in preparation for that I'd like to begin to look at that through the scriptures by starting by looking at the shoulder what is the significance of the shoulder and I'd like to begin in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6. it says For unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment with Justice from henceforth even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this so we find out that Christ is coming as the son of David to sit upon the throne of David and the government shall be upon his shoulder that means the entire Kingdom the responsibility and care of the whole Kingdom rests upon his shoulder because the shoulder in the back is the strongest part of a man and that shoulder and back signifies the strength of a man that upon the strength of Jesus Christ this Kingdom will rest not upon the strength of the subjects but upon the strength of the king amen and so we see a beautiful type of this in Luke Chapter 15. Jesus is speaking in Luke chapter 15 verse 4 it says what man of you having a hundred sheep if you lose one of them doth not leave the 1909 in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing amen we find that there's a lost sheep just like we were one of God's lost sheep before he found us and that sheep had no ability to save itself he had no strength to find its way home amen it wasn't depending on its own strength for salvation but it was the strength of the Shepherd that was declared and the shepherd sought out the the little lost sheep and the shepherd found the sheep and when he found him he took the sheep and placed the Sheep upon the strongest part of the shoulder the the shepherd across his shoulders showing that that sheep was not saved by its own strength by its own will by its own wisdom but that sheep was saved by the strength of the shepherd and we have been saved by the strength of the shepherd not our own strength not our own ability we could not find ourselves we could not find the shepherd we were lost but the shepherd found us and laid us upon his shoulders for the government shall be upon his shoulders and another element of this I want to look at is in Revelations chapter 3 verse 7. it says unto the angel of the church in Philadelphia right these things saith he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth in no man openeth we know that Christ is the son of David will sit upon the throne of David but also he seemed depicted here as having the Key of David in this scripture in Revelation is referring back to a scripture in the book of Isaiah Isaiah 22 verse 22 says in the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder so this key will be upon his shoulder so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open the prophet of God and the church age book says this but what does this key signify he's tying all these scriptures together now what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does the shoulder have to do with it in reverse the Isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does this mean the answer is in the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that is that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God Sovereign God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight amen he chose her amen we see this in John 15 when Jesus says in John 15 16 ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain the disciples weren't looking for Christ Christ was looking for them they didn't choose him he chose them and they responded to that call amen and so in in in the great story that we see through the scriptures that God he was foreshadowing all the way back in Genesis what he wanted to do amen he was going to have a son and that son was going to have a bride but we know that in the fall of Man in order for him to take a bride he would have to pay a price of redemption so that he could unite because she was now on a fallen state for all of mankind was fallen so Christ came to bear our sins on his shoulders and he bore those sins all the way to Calvary so he could pay the price for us he was taking response ability for our sin he was taking responsibility for our fails our failures our mistakes our life and he was bearing that responsibility so that he could Purge us and free us from that so he could Unite with us in a union and he could we could be one flesh amen with Christ we see this in Isaiah 53 verse 4 it says surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all then in verse 11 it says he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out a soul into death and he was numbered with the transgression transgressors and he bear the sins of many and made intercession for the transgression Jesus yielded his shoulders for us amen he invites us now to lay our life upon his shoulder so what you'll demonstrate shortly here is a demonstration of the great Union between Christ and his bride and the great opportunity that a people have to lay their life at Christ's feet and to take their Veil amen and lay it over his shoulder and he has already lended his shoulder for the occasion and he will bear our life taking full responsibility for whatever we have been he takes responsibility for it what we are is what he wants because he has chosen Us and how is that choice manifest because all none can come to me unless the father draws him and if the father is pricking the heart and drawing it is a declaration of Christ's Choice amen and if we can respond to that choice he has a shoulder there that we can lay our whole life upon and now he will free us from our life by his shoulder by them what he bore on his shoulder and he carries our sins far away freeing us so that now he can unite to us whatever we were he takes responsibility for whatever we are is what he has chosen what we will be he is obligated to care for and take care of from here on out amen so now we can truly see Colossians 3 3 for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God now you've given your life to him you've died to your life you've been renewed in Christ to a New Life I I am sorry to say but not so sorry to say that during this ceremony at some point in this ceremony there will no longer be a Caitlyn Williams she will fade off the scene whatever she was will fade away because during this ceremony she will be transformed from Caitlyn Williams to Caitlyn errand and it's a new name and it's a new life amen Daniel and making his choice he has accepted responsibility for you whatever you are whatever you were wherever you've been he Bears the responsibility by making his choice he says I'll take that on me what you are now is what he wants for you are his choice above all others he chose you amen and in doing so he's purged you from any idea anybody else has because now you will be the wife of a husband and nobody else has any say in it whatsoever it was Daniel's choice right and then from this day forward whatever will happen whatever circumstances happen in life he is oh he will pledge himself through this ceremony to care for all of your burdens and to carry all of your loads and to help you through everything that happens for Christ has taken the responsibility for all of our sins he bore upon himself and accepted us he chose us as we are now because we're the one he wants and he's from almost whatever will be in the future he will take care of it amen now we can see first Peter 5 7. casting all your care upon him for he careth for you this word casting in the Greek means to throw upon to place upon so we can throw Upon Our Place Upon Our husband Jesus Christ all of our care and that care means care or anxiety whatever we're worried about whatever is stressing us whatever we cannot solve ourselves we can place that and throw that or cast out upon Christ's shoulders and then it says for he careth for you this word careth means to take care of or to care about so from this day forward you can take all of your anxieties and all of your worries you no longer have to care for yourself for there is a man that you've come under the headship of that's pledged to care for you you can cast all of your anxiety upon him just like the Bride of Jesus Christ has no care or no worry that she cannot cast Upon Jesus Christ and he's obligated himself to take care of it and care for us Amen in the demonstration that you're demonstrating in this Union you're showing us the great mystery of the Bible you're displaying it and a man and woman coming together to be one you'll display it in transferring your Veil to brother Daniel's shoulder but I encourage you display it every day of your life display the great Union the Oneness the harmony the unity between Christ and his bride as Christ takes headship over for the government is upon his shoulders Daniel may you take headship and care and love and nurture and care for shelter and protect Caitlyn Caitlin reverence your husband and give him the due respect for out of this care comes a reciprocating love ing the one who cared for you loving the one who bore responsibility for you one loving the one who chose you and loving the one who promised to care for all of your needs amen may you display every day the life of Jesus Christ and his bride amen if you could turn to face one another I'd like to go to the vows Daniel if you could look to Caitlyn and please repeat after me I Daniel take the Caitlyn hi Daniel take the Caitlyn to be my wedded wife to be my wedded wife to have and behold from this day forward to having
