[16:59] [Music]
[17:01] remember God
[17:04] is greater than the storm
[17:08] take courage for

[17:19] and he calls my name amen when he calls

[17:35] last time should falter
[17:39] it makes me sad
[17:42] [Music]
[17:44] upon the water
[17:47] when the road you walk
[17:54] and your strength
[17:59] the heart feels
[18:02] [Music]
[18:06] great
[18:07] ER storm
[18:10] take courage for foreign
[18:27] testimony anyway
[18:29] uh just me being up here as a testimony
[18:32] about a year ago in April
[18:35] I uh
[18:38] clipped my index finger with a power saw
[18:43] and it cut the nerve and then to my
[18:46] index finger I could turn the prayer
[18:47] request in for that and uh
[18:52] so it healed up pretty quickly and I was
[18:54] able to return to normal use and I could
[18:57] do anything with it that I wanted to
[18:58] except play the guitar
[19:00] because putting pressure
[19:02] on a specific point like a guitar string
[19:05] was just undoable
[19:08] I picked up the guitar a couple times
[19:10] for the past year and uh
[19:12] still I was just just wasn't possible I
[19:16] just kind of waited on at the heel and
[19:17] just left it in prayer and it never did
[19:19] get to feel any better so about a week
[19:21] ago
[19:22] I thought well I'm going to figure out
[19:24] how to play this guitar with just three
[19:25] fingers and so I worked on it I re-tuned
[19:29] the guitar to different tunings and
[19:31] tried different chords and uh
[19:34] well the finger index finger just would
[19:36] not work so I was going to find a way to
[19:39] do it and I was going to sing a special
[19:40] with just three fingers and then
[19:43] Wednesday brother Noel Johnson was
[19:45] talking about a man he prayed for that
[19:47] had a crushed hand and I think no
[19:49] feeling in that finger when he said that
[19:51] my index finger started tingling I
[19:54] thought well my faith is not brother
[19:57] Noel or or in my prayers even
[20:01] you know I'd I'd given up Miss Lord if
[20:03] you want me to be able to use that
[20:04] finger then you're very capable and if
[20:06] not then we'll find another way to to
[20:08] get around and praise you anyway
[20:10] and so uh
[20:11] I went
[20:13] I don't know if I tried to play it after
[20:14] Wednesday but I think it was Friday I
[20:17] picked up the guitar and that index
[20:19] finger worked and I may have a dead
[20:22] string or two but it's still trying to
[20:24] learn its way around the guitar my
[20:25] fingers are still tender haven't played
[20:27] the guitar for I'm making excuses I
[20:29] never was any good when I could could so
[20:32] this is a testimony today to even stand
[20:34] here and be able to play the guitar and
[20:36] I just placed my life in God's hands
[20:39] uh he knows what's best and he knows
[20:43] what we need so we just rest in him
[20:45] so we'll try to play this in the key of
[20:48] G Steve it is your responsibility to
[20:50] cover all the dead strings
[20:54] there are walls made by man built by
[21:00] frail and human hands that an enemy
[21:06] can scale and get to you
[21:10] [Music]
[21:12] but there is one for which I long it
[21:18] makes all the other strong it's a wall
[21:24] of prayer surrounding me
[21:28] [Music]
[21:31] sometimes the wall of Grace
[21:35] sometimes a wall of Faith other times
[21:41] it's sweet mercies that I need
[21:47] but the one for which I long it makes
[21:53] all the other strong I need a wall of
[21:59] prayer surrounding me
[22:04] there are walls made by man built by
[22:10] frail and human hands that an enemy
[22:15] can scale and get to you
[22:21] but there is one protecting me from my
[22:27] greatest
[22:29] enemy it's a wall that Satan can't break
[22:35] through
[22:39] sometimes a wall of Grace
[22:44] sometimes a wall of Faith other times
[22:49] it's sweet mercies that I need
[22:55] but the one for which I long it makes
[23:00] all the other strong I need a wall of
[23:07] prayer surrounding me
[23:12] oh my brother when I'm weak would you
[23:17] stand instead for me and pray your
[23:21] Fortress around me strong that can't be
[23:26] moved
[23:29] and I promise you today
[23:33] when I bow my knees to pray I'll do my
[23:38] best to
[23:40] a wall a prayer for you
[23:46] sometimes a wall of Grace
[23:49] [Music]
[23:51] sometimes a wall of Faith other times
[23:56] it's sweet mercies that I need
[24:02] but the one for which I long it makes
[24:07] all the other strong I need a wall of
[24:13] prayer surrounding me
[24:20] sweeter of prayer Sweet Hour of Prayer
[24:26] hear that calls me from a world of care
[24:34] but the one for which I long it makes
[24:40] all the other strong I need a wall of
[24:46] prayer surrounding me

[30:13] always appreciate a little more time

[30:18] amen before we read I also want to say I
[30:20] appreciate the song specials that was a
[30:22] real blessing and the testimony brother
[30:24] Ron I appreciate you sharing that with
[30:26] us that was tremendous God keeps his
[30:28] word amen and he doesn't always do it
[30:30] the way we expect but he always does it
[30:32] amen and he has the privilege to do it
[30:35] in unexpected ways but it doesn't matter
[30:37] amen he still fulfills his word praise
[30:40] God
[30:40] man let's look at Deuteronomy chapter 30
[30:42] verse 19.
[30:45] for one scripture and then we'll allow
[30:46] you to be seated
[30:48] Deuteronomy 30 verse 19.
[30:54] I call Heaven and Earth to record this
[30:57] day against you that I have set before
[30:59] you life and death blessing and cursing
[31:02] therefore choose life that both thou and
[31:06] thy seed may live that thou mayest love
[31:08] the Lord thy God and that thou mayest
[31:10] obey his voice and that thou mayest
[31:11] cleave unto him for he is thy life and
[31:14] the length of thy days and thou mayest
[31:16] dwell in the land which the Lord swear
[31:18] unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac to
[31:21] Jacob to give them may God bless you as
[31:24] you seated may the Lord bless us as we
[31:26] look into his word I also want to remind
[31:28] you that today is first Sunday of the
[31:31] month so we'll have our communion and
[31:32] feet Washing Service again this
[31:34] afternoon
[31:36] so we'll announce that again at the end
[31:37] of service
[31:38] amen we see here that Moses is laying
[31:42] out the lawn and he's setting before
[31:44] them he goes I'm setting before you life
[31:48] and death
[31:49] I'm setting before you uh two choices
[31:52] you can make amen and it's amazing that
[31:55] Moses says choose life amen choose life
[31:58] so that you can have these benefits
[31:59] choose life so you can remain in the
[32:01] land choose life so that you can love
[32:02] the Lord choose life amen but but it's
[32:06] it's always interesting to me how all
[32:09] through the Bible that God has never
[32:11] taken away this law of free moral agency
[32:14] and give the people an opportunity to
[32:16] choose amen and there's a whole if you
[32:18] read through the Bible there's a whole
[32:20] uh theme constantly running through the
[32:23] word of cause and effect choice and
[32:26] result amen decisions and the effects of
[32:29] those decisions amen and we can never
[32:31] get away from that in our own life we
[32:33] never get away from the scripture in
[32:34] anywhere amen because it's a principle
[32:36] that God laid out and through that
[32:38] principle he teaches us
[32:39] so many things so this morning I just
[32:42] want to take for a subject just the
[32:44] title decisions
[32:46] just decisions
[32:48] brother bear says in Satan's Eden he
[32:50] says Satan has succeeded in perverting
[32:52] and taking over this world and making it
[32:54] his kingdom that man was put on by free
[32:57] moral agency to choose for themselves
[32:59] what kind of Life they desired and that
[33:02] shows what's in your heart
[33:04] see you know what your actions speaks so
[33:07] loud it drowns your voice
[33:09] I love I love these to me I love these
[33:12] simple principles that are absolutely
[33:14] profound
[33:16] because you we've been put on free moral
[33:20] agency he says to choose for themselves
[33:22] what kind of Life they desire
[33:25] amen and the kind of choice we make
[33:28] brings results it has an effect
[33:31] so what we decide as an effect and so if
[33:35] I could say it this way amen our actions
[33:37] are a reflection of our decisions
[33:41] amen our decisions produce actions
[33:45] because once you decide something you
[33:48] must act upon the decision when I decide
[33:50] to do something then then after I make
[33:52] the decisions and my actions will follow
[33:54] my decision
[33:56] amen and so many times we we tried to we
[34:00] I guess for Me Maybe for me I I getting
[34:03] stuck in this sequence of indecision
[34:05] sometimes where I don't want to make a
[34:08] decision I don't know what decision to
[34:10] make and sometimes it's good to pause
[34:11] and not make a a rush decision sometimes
[34:14] you is I've seen people make snap
[34:16] decisions and regret those but I've also
[34:18] been in the place myself where I delay
[34:20] decision making
[34:21] and I kicked the can down the road and
[34:24] I'm hoping that all the actions take
[34:25] care of themselves and everything works
[34:27] out right so that I don't have to make a
[34:29] decision
[34:30] and that rarely works out amen every
[34:33] once in a while you see God come on the
[34:34] scene and all of a sudden give you a
[34:35] piece and now you know what to make and
[34:37] you make the decision and you move on
[34:38] but but sometimes I'm just trying to get
[34:41] it to work out without me having to make
[34:43] a decision because I'm uncertain of the
[34:45] decision or or I don't want to deal with
[34:47] the consequences of making the decision
[34:50] because decision brings action
[34:54] decision brings results as soon as I
[34:56] make a decision I'll act upon the
[34:58] decision I made and so I delay and I
[35:00] delay and I delay and I delay amen and
[35:03] for me many times that kicking the can
[35:05] down the road never works because all I
[35:06] do is make the situation more
[35:08] complicated and more people around me
[35:09] get frustrated and everybody's looking
[35:11] at me why won't you design amen until
[35:13] finally I get back into a corner and I
[35:15] make a decision and as soon as I make a
[35:17] decision action begins to follow
[35:19] and we find that God does that to us he
[35:23] puts us in a place where we have to make
[35:24] a decision because actions follow
[35:26] decisions
[35:28] amen but decisions are risky
[35:32] they're risky
[35:35] amen but we're never going to escape it
[35:38] in this lifetime
[35:40] because those decisions we make shows
[35:42] what's in our hearts
[35:46] in the brother realm says your actions
[35:48] as soon as he says that he says your
[35:49] actions speaks so loud it draws your
[35:51] voice so actions follow decisions and
[35:54] declare what's in your heart
[35:58] amen
[36:00] and the message testimony on the sea the
[36:02] prophet of God says so he didn't pay any
[36:05] attention his little face read but he
[36:06] was determined to see Jesus he's
[36:08] speaking of Zacchaeus Zacchaeus the tax
[36:10] collector the businessman who wants to
[36:12] see Jesus passing by says you see he
[36:16] wanted to get a look at him he didn't
[36:18] believe he was a prophet and if he
[36:20] wasn't a prophet he was going right down
[36:21] there and really tell him about it
[36:23] that's all going and saying well you're
[36:25] an imposter you ought to be in the city
[36:27] so he gets him on top of the garbage can
[36:29] and shinny's up the tree Amen brother
[36:32] says oh you don't use the word shinny do
[36:34] you
[36:35] he said that's Southern that means climb
[36:37] up the tree you know get your knees a
[36:38] hold of it well he called it shinny down
[36:40] here up the tree got up the tree and he
[36:42] got up there and he found where two
[36:44] limbs hit like this and he sat down
[36:46] right on both of them he says there
[36:49] that's where we all come where two ways
[36:53] meet yours and gods that's where you
[36:55] make your decision
[36:58] he said that's where Zacchaeus Was
[37:00] Zacchaeus was sitting on where two limbs
[37:03] go in two different directions and he
[37:05] was sitting right in the crook of that
[37:06] amen where where two ways meet amen your
[37:10] way in God's way and that's this place
[37:12] you have to make your decision
[37:15] amen he says it again in this message he
[37:17] said he raised up his leaf and he looked
[37:19] down said what's what's them oh that's
[37:22] supposed to be his disciples Rebecca
[37:24] told me about uh I'll wait just a minute
[37:26] then after a while he raised up the leaf
[37:28] again said now let's see if I'm covered
[37:30] up good and I'm sitting on two limbs
[37:32] that's where two ways meet and that's
[37:34] where a lot of people sit where yours in
[37:36] God's ways meet that's right got to make
[37:39] a decision from right there
[37:41] so many times when we're forced into a
[37:43] decision we have to make a decision amen
[37:46] it's a transition time and so many times
[37:48] amen we get in transition and I've said
[37:51] many times transitions are very tricky
[37:53] places
[37:54] because you're going to make a decision
[37:55] and that decision is going to determine
[37:57] how life is going to go amen and and and
[38:00] their their these transitions where you
[38:02] have to make a decision about work
[38:04] decisions about school a decision about
[38:06] who you'll marry decisions about what
[38:08] church you attend decisions about what
[38:10] you're going to do in certain situations
[38:12] these decisions carry with it great
[38:14] consequences because action will begin
[38:16] to follow decisions
[38:19] we get to a place of decision and now we
[38:21] have to determine what is God's way and
[38:24] what is my way amen and we and we we're
[38:27] given the privilege to choose we can
[38:29] choose brother bam said there's an
[38:30] unwritten law amongst us of choosing
[38:32] amen you can choose if whether you want
[38:34] an education or not what kind of job you
[38:36] want to work or or you can I mean you
[38:39] can choose to to to
[38:41] buy and to sell and to move and to do
[38:44] all these things God has given us the
[38:46] privilege to choose amen and God doesn't
[38:48] micromanage our choices
[38:51] because they have a cause and effect in
[38:53] our life that brings good results amen
[38:56] and brings education brings a teaching
[38:58] instruction in our lives where God has
[39:00] allowed us to make wrong decisions
[39:03] sometimes I wish God would micromanage
[39:05] my decisions and I wish that I would get
[39:07] a letter in the mail and that letter
[39:09] would say on this date do this and on
[39:11] that date do that God knows with all my
[39:13] heart that's what I want to do amen I
[39:16] want the letter amen but but then all of
[39:18] a sudden we take away the whole lesson
[39:21] that comes from having to wrestle it out
[39:23] make choices we have to weigh our own
[39:25] motives and objectives our own goals and
[39:27] Desires in life and we have to weigh
[39:29] them all against the word of God and
[39:31] then wait for the spirit of God to give
[39:33] us an unction and then move amen there's
[39:35] so much that we learn through decisions
[39:38] that God is not going to micromanage our
[39:40] decisions but he is going to allow us to
[39:43] to sweat it out to go through the
[39:44] process and sometimes make the wrong
[39:46] choice amen so that that we can come
[39:49] back around amen having gained some
[39:51] knowledge some understanding some
[39:52] character some perspective of ourselves
[39:56] I don't know about you but I've made
[39:57] some wrong choices and those wrong
[39:59] choices taught me a lot about me and I
[40:02] say what what was motivating me to make
[40:05] that choice and I can tell what was
[40:07] motivating me is whatever the situation
[40:09] was and I had to make a choice amen self
[40:12] got mixed in somewhere either
[40:14] self-preservation or self-promotion or
[40:16] our self-love or or whatever some some
[40:19] way self-mixed in amen and deluded my
[40:22] choice and I made a choice for self
[40:25] [Music]
[40:27] and those are the choices I'm most
[40:29] greatly
[40:30] regret
[40:33] because living for others is looking
[40:35] heaven in the face surrendering our life
[40:36] to Christ is the way to move forward
[40:38] amen but and so many times it you get
[40:42] into this situations it's hard to sort
[40:44] those things out and sometimes you don't
[40:45] really understand where your heart is
[40:48] until after you make the choice and and
[40:50] the sequence of events unfold and after
[40:52] they unfolded you come down the road a
[40:54] little bit you can look back and say I
[40:56] was wrong
[40:58] and then we can go and and when we go to
[41:02] those places then it could lock us up
[41:04] and we can get discouraged and never
[41:05] make another choice and I'm not doing
[41:06] that again or we can just take the
[41:08] lesson that God intended for us to get
[41:10] and say oh God help me never to take
[41:13] self again now me never when I get on
[41:16] the limb of two ways help me never go to
[41:18] the way of self
[41:20] help me go your way
[41:24] amen there's a story let's let's turn to
[41:27] Second Kings and just look at something
[41:29] for a minute
[41:32] I just want to look at several things in
[41:34] the Bible this morning and all of this
[41:36] is very very familiar to us but it's so
[41:40] it's so part of our life
[41:43] that we don't want to miss the
[41:44] instruction
[41:46] Kings
[41:48] seven and three
[41:52] Second Kings seven
[41:57] chapter seven and verse 3.
[42:01] said and there were four leprous men at
[42:03] the entering into the gate and they said
[42:04] one to another why sit we here until we
[42:07] die
[42:08] if we will enter into the city then the
[42:11] famine is in the city and we shall die
[42:13] there and if we sit still here we die
[42:15] also now therefore come and let us fall
[42:17] into the host of the syrians if they
[42:19] save us alive we shall live and if they
[42:22] kill us we shall but die
[42:26] these these individuals were backed into
[42:28] a corner
[42:30] there was a severe famine in the land
[42:32] the syrians had cut off all the supplies
[42:33] amen they were starving out the city the
[42:36] lepers were sitting outside the city
[42:39] they said why sit we here till we die if
[42:41] we go in we die we stay here we die amen
[42:44] we go to the syrians we might die
[42:48] so let's take the might die option amen
[42:51] at least there's a chance it might only
[42:53] be five percent chance but let's take
[42:54] the five percent chance and we realize
[42:56] they got into a straight they got into a
[42:58] situation that they didn't want to be in
[43:00] nobody else wanted to be in but it was
[43:02] forcing them to make a move it was
[43:04] forcing them to make a decision and that
[43:07] decision actually produced life not just
[43:10] life and salvation for them but life and
[43:13] salvation for the entire city amen
[43:15] and God puts us in hard places sometimes
[43:18] but don't be afraid of the hard places
[43:20] amen because sometimes we come to
[43:22] Junctions and Crossroads and we get to
[43:24] where we can no longer delay we sat long
[43:27] enough if we sit any longer we die amen
[43:29] we die sometimes we get to the place if
[43:32] I sit any longer I'll die spiritually
[43:33] I've got to move
[43:35] if I sit here any longer amen my family
[43:38] will die if I sit in there any longer I
[43:40] will emotionally die if I sit here any
[43:42] longer I've got to make a move and I
[43:44] don't know which move to make amen but
[43:46] I've got to get moving amen and when you
[43:48] get moving then God begins to work out
[43:50] circumstances
[43:51] but when we sit we just sit and we sit
[43:54] and we sit until God puts us into a
[43:56] place where we've got to move amen they
[43:58] had when they moved out they had no
[44:00] guarantee
[44:02] this is another principle with God Amen
[44:04] so many times when we when we make a
[44:06] decision we don't know what the results
[44:09] are going to be for sure
[44:12] and I say that's most of the time we
[44:15] think that this is the right decision
[44:16] and we think for these reasons and and I
[44:18] believe I feel impressed of the Lord
[44:20] I've been in prayer about it it's
[44:21] according to the word I got all of these
[44:24] things but I just don't know and and
[44:26] sometimes I wish that I knew like I wish
[44:29] I knew if I did this if I said yes to
[44:31] this that it would work out
[44:33] because it's got potential not to work
[44:34] out amen I tell you these are all the
[44:37] things that keep me in indecision amen
[44:39] because I I I say God I've prayed this
[44:42] way before God you speak to people you
[44:44] showed dreams you can show me exactly
[44:46] what to do
[44:49] is that the truth
[44:50] he can show me but sometimes in showing
[44:53] me exactly what to do he defeats his own
[44:55] purpose and allowing me to have to make
[44:57] the decision and operate by free moral
[45:00] agency
[45:03] so I've been in the place praying and
[45:05] waiting and praying and crying and
[45:07] saying God you speak to other people I
[45:09] hear other people give testimony God
[45:11] come down and spoke to me show me the
[45:12] dream and I knew exactly what to do and
[45:14] it worked out perfect
[45:16] um
[45:18] sometimes in the testimony somebody
[45:20] gives they're just clipping the high
[45:21] parts they're not telling you they made
[45:23] the decision and it looked like it went
[45:25] wrong and then it finally worked out
[45:26] right and everything in the end worked
[45:27] out perfect
[45:29] because that's usually the way it goes
[45:33] usually you make this and say God you
[45:35] showed me this you spoke to my heart I
[45:37] believe it was you but everything's
[45:39] going backwards
[45:41] I made this choice and I thought we'd
[45:43] move on and we went back and it got
[45:45] worse and things didn't get better
[45:46] immediately got worse and then they got
[45:48] worse and then they got worse but then
[45:49] in the end it all worked out perfect
[45:51] some miraculous way
[45:53] so when we tell the testimony we say oh
[45:55] God spoke to my heart and he dropped it
[45:56] in here he said this and it worked out
[45:58] perfect
[46:00] let's be nice to each other and tell all
[46:03] the story amen Let's help one another
[46:05] and tell all the details the agony the
[46:07] prayers the self-doubt the questions
[46:12] amen
[46:15] praise God
[46:17] brother Ron could have given his
[46:18] testimony today in such a way that he
[46:20] would have been the spiritual superhero
[46:21] and we would all have been zeros
[46:24] but he told it real
[46:25] he believed he trusted God he committed
[46:27] to the Lord he didn't he didn't have
[46:29] hopes that in that service it was going
[46:31] to fix it they didn't he didn't know
[46:32] amen but God was faithful to his word
[46:35] anyways amen that's a wonderful
[46:37] testimony
[46:40] praise God
[46:41] a certain reality to life
[46:44] there's a certain a certain order to
[46:46] life that God set up and allowed amen
[46:49] and if we don't pay attention to that we
[46:51] don't honor it we're always looking for
[46:53] something else to work out amen and not
[46:56] working in the program God put us in
[46:59] so God put us in the program uh uh I I
[47:02] hope that I can say this to make sense
[47:05] amen I want to say it in a way that you
[47:07] understand what I'm saying but I don't
[47:08] want to I don't want to take away amen
[47:10] from the supernatural things of God God
[47:12] interjects himself in our life
[47:14] supernaturally over and over and over
[47:16] again to steer us to correct us to help
[47:18] us to rescue us
[47:20] but every day the sun still comes up and
[47:23] every day the sun still sets and every
[47:25] day you've got to eat food and every day
[47:27] you earn your bread by the sweat of your
[47:29] brow
[47:30] like the principles that are established
[47:33] that we've been placed into this Earth
[47:34] that we must operate by they're not
[47:36] going away that's the daily life
[47:40] and we understand the whole law of
[47:43] reaping and sowing God is not changing
[47:45] the whole law of reaping and sowing
[47:47] we are sowing and reaping you sow a seed
[47:50] to reap a harvest if you want to have
[47:52] food in the winter you must plant in the
[47:55] spring you must be diligent through the
[47:56] summer you must Gather in the Harvest
[47:58] God's not taking that away even though
[48:00] God can provide supernaturally is that
[48:02] right
[48:04] so when the children of Israel work out
[48:06] in the wilderness and they didn't have
[48:08] time to plant they did not have time to
[48:10] sow they didn't have time to cultivate
[48:13] amen God fed them
[48:16] but when they went into the land where
[48:18] somebody had already sowed seed and
[48:19] cultivated God stopped the manna from
[48:21] coming they ate the old corn of the land
[48:23] but the next year they had to plant
[48:26] they had to work with the principles
[48:28] because why amen the life that we live
[48:31] in is teaching us we're here for
[48:33] Education amen there's there's a law of
[48:36] gravity can God cause you to defy
[48:37] gravity absolutely he's done it before
[48:39] he can do it again he can stop the sun
[48:42] amen but he didn't stop the Sun every
[48:44] day he stopped the sun once
[48:46] because of a great time of need and
[48:48] something that God wanted to accomplish
[48:49] for his purpose
[48:51] we understand
[48:54] so that means in order to operate amen I
[48:58] can't I can't dawdle all day long on
[49:01] work I need to do amen and finally get
[49:04] to something I need to accomplish while
[49:05] there's still daylight and say God stop
[49:07] the Sun
[49:09] can he yes will he know because you
[49:12] wasted your time
[49:14] and you didn't want to operate within
[49:16] the boundaries that God places to
[49:18] operate in so that we could learn cause
[49:21] and effect we could learn action and
[49:23] reaction
[49:27] so the same thing with decisions
[49:29] we're not going to get away from it
[49:31] we're not going to get around it amen we
[49:33] have to make the decisions but there's a
[49:34] power that comes with making a decision
[49:36] because action begins to follow
[49:39] so we we're placing this God God can
[49:42] break the rules anytime he wants
[49:45] and he does he has for me he asks for
[49:47] you he will again
[49:50] but that doesn't mean we can live
[49:52] Unfaithful and untrue amen and and
[49:55] outside the realm that he placed us and
[49:57] expected God to come on the rescue every
[49:59] time he would be defeating the whole
[50:01] purpose of gravity amen where if you if
[50:04] you jump off of a tower you're going to
[50:06] fall and get hurt
[50:11] amen
[50:13] can God stop you absolutely can God
[50:15] prevent you from getting hurt absolutely
[50:19] but if you're if you're foolish enough
[50:23] to tempt God and to do of your own will
[50:26] gravity is going to take its effect
[50:30] and God's going to allow it he's going
[50:32] to allow your decision your actions to
[50:34] have the necessary consequences to learn
[50:37] that I can't violate all the principles
[50:40] of Nature and expect
[50:43] to live
[50:45] I can't violate all the principles
[50:47] around me and expect
[50:49] to flourish
[50:51] so how can I expect to violate the
[50:53] principles of the word of God and expect
[50:55] anything good to come out of it
[50:58] it all works together amen that's why we
[51:01] train our children that's why we put
[51:02] boundaries on our children and we teach
[51:04] them not to cross the boundaries and
[51:05] then we have his parents to put
[51:07] consequences on those boundaries why
[51:09] we're teaching them the the whole
[51:12] principle of life we're helping build
[51:13] them character they're learning cause
[51:15] and effect they're learning decisions
[51:17] action and consequences why so that they
[51:20] can learn to obey God that they can live
[51:22] in this world and that they can serve
[51:23] God because God's law works the same way
[51:28] so God is
[51:30] going to require that we make our
[51:33] choices
[51:34] and they will have the effect that
[51:36] they're going to have some good some bad
[51:38] amen but they're going to work and it's
[51:42] going to work together for our good
[51:45] amen
[51:48] brother brother I'm speaking here in the
[51:50] patriarch Abraham from 1964 and he's
[51:52] speaking of the three Hebrew children
[51:53] and the fiery furnace said they had to
[51:56] go in the fire when they did they was in
[51:58] the fire and the only thing that taken
[51:59] place this fiery test only unlocked the
[52:02] bands of their of their bands of their
[52:05] hands many times God lets us when we get
[52:08] all bound up with the world bound up he
[52:10] lets the fiery tests come upon us where
[52:12] we have to make a decision and when we
[52:15] do that the only thing the test can do
[52:17] when a real Seed of Abraham is standing
[52:19] at the crossroads of a decision and he
[52:22] makes his decision to serve God it can
[52:24] only cut the bands loose and make us
[52:26] free
[52:28] Satan might give you a disease he might
[52:30] give you one thing another how you know
[52:32] it's not God got you on a Crossroads to
[52:35] see what kind of decision you'll make
[52:39] amen so many things obstacles get worse
[52:41] things I mean you can get to situation
[52:44] your situation at work and get so
[52:46] miserable amen and if they change some
[52:49] personnel and they change some policy
[52:50] and all of a sudden your work situation
[52:52] can become so miserable you can't abide
[52:54] it anymore amen how do you know it's not
[52:57] God trying to bring you to another place
[53:00] amen you don't know amen these things
[53:03] God sometimes pushes us amen into a
[53:06] place where we come to a Crossroads
[53:08] where we have to make a decision amen
[53:10] and that decision is going to bring us
[53:12] into a whole another atmosphere a whole
[53:15] another level a whole another course of
[53:17] action
[53:19] amen if we had it our way
[53:22] well I shouldn't say R if I had it my
[53:24] way
[53:25] I'm sorry so many times I put my own
[53:27] opinion on you guys I'm sorry if I had
[53:29] it my way
[53:31] I want everything predictable and
[53:33] operate the same and I want to know
[53:34] what's going to happen and I want it all
[53:36] everything to be in tidy little spots
[53:38] and compartments and nothing out of
[53:39] order nothing random
[53:42] amen and then I would have security and
[53:44] I wouldn't worry and I also wouldn't
[53:46] pray as much and I wouldn't be dependent
[53:48] on God and I wouldn't search the
[53:49] scriptures and I wouldn't listen to the
[53:51] message for answers and
[53:56] so God will come to time jumble up our
[53:58] world
[53:59] amen and cause us to move into
[54:02] desperation amen and back us into a
[54:04] corner where I don't want to make this
[54:05] decision I don't want to make this
[54:06] decision I don't want to make this
[54:08] decision it's going to cause separation
[54:09] it's going to cause misunderstanding
[54:11] it's going to lead me into a place I'm
[54:13] not sure of the future I don't know what
[54:15] would happen next and God's moving us
[54:17] into a decision amen and that decision
[54:20] we we don't want to make but we keep
[54:22] moving and moving and moving until
[54:24] finally we're like the lepers at the
[54:26] gate I've got to do something I can't
[54:27] sit here and die I can't go here now
[54:30] I've only got one choice I got to start
[54:32] moving
[54:34] praise God
[54:37] I I say Stephen strue used to make the
[54:39] statement he said it to me once and I
[54:41] never forgot it he said you can't steer
[54:43] a parked car and the helm on the ship
[54:46] there's no good when it's at Port
[54:50] if you want God to lead you you got to
[54:51] get moving amen we got to do something
[54:54] we got to move and say Godly we can't
[54:56] just sit on our heels and say God lead
[54:58] me sometimes it makes a decision to get
[55:00] into action and get moving and as you're
[55:02] moving God can steer that ship but
[55:04] sometimes we sit there and say God you
[55:06] take the wheel and you steer and you're
[55:08] like well just push the pedal and what
[55:11] we'll do what we can do
[55:13] amen we got to have faith that God will
[55:17] lead us amen we have to Faith when we
[55:19] make a decision if we're honest-hearted
[55:21] in the decisions we make and we make it
[55:23] according to the word and what we feel
[55:25] is the word of God and we've done our
[55:26] best to judge our motives and John our
[55:28] objectives then if we're wrong we trust
[55:31] God to help us amen he still has a rod
[55:33] he still has a staff he's still a
[55:35] Shepherd who will guide us
[55:38] we have to trust him amen
[55:43] amen Jesus
[55:47] says unto his disciples in John 6 he
[55:50] says wherefore said I unto you that no
[55:52] man can come unto me except it were
[55:54] given unto him of the father
[55:57] from that time many of his disciples
[55:58] went back and walked no more with him
[56:00] then said Jesus unto the twelve will you
[56:03] also go away
[56:05] then Simon Peter answered him Lord to
[56:07] whom shall we go thou Hast the words of
[56:09] eternal life and we believe in our sure
[56:11] that thou art the Christ the son of the
[56:13] Living God Jesus answered them have not
[56:15] I chosen you twelve and one of you is
[56:17] the devil
[56:19] Jesus I mean the situation here is
[56:22] getting bad
[56:23] the Ministerial Association just left
[56:25] the crowds were leaving things are said
[56:27] that are not easily understood the
[56:30] disciples themselves are in confusion
[56:31] amen and Jesus they they walk away and
[56:34] Jesus just turns to the 12 and says will
[56:37] you go also
[56:39] it's your choice you're free
[56:41] do you want to go
[56:43] and Peter doesn't understand what's
[56:44] happening he doesn't comprehend all
[56:47] that's going on around him all he sees
[56:48] is negative but he knows one thing amen
[56:51] we know that you're Christ the son of
[56:53] the Living God and you have the words of
[56:55] eternal life I don't understand all of
[56:56] this but I'm going to stay right here
[56:58] and Jesus already told him I've not
[57:01] chosen you not chosen me but I've chosen
[57:03] you amen it wasn't you see God has given
[57:06] us free moral agency and he's given us
[57:08] the right to make our decisions but
[57:09] there's certain decisions that no matter
[57:11] how much you make it won't have any
[57:13] effect if God didn't already decide
[57:15] amen you'll never be a Son of God if God
[57:18] hasn't already decided you're a Son of
[57:20] God and you'll never come to the Lord if
[57:21] he hasn't already drawn you amen but
[57:24] when he draws you he gives you the
[57:25] choice of whether or not you'll follow
[57:28] he comes to the disciples washing their
[57:30] Nets and he says hey come follow me they
[57:33] weren't forced they had a choice but
[57:34] they chose to drop their Nets and follow
[57:36] him amen but they could have never done
[57:39] that if he hadn't come to them first
[57:42] so we know certain things in our life
[57:44] are already ordained of God Amen will
[57:46] never come to them unless God had
[57:48] already decided it's not like our
[57:50] decisions will ever supersede his
[57:52] decisions
[57:53] even when we make wrong decisions
[57:55] they'll bring a correction to bring us
[57:57] back into his decision
[57:59] remember when brother Branham when he
[58:01] first met the Pentecostals and he got
[58:03] invitations all over and he went back
[58:05] and told his mother-in-law and his
[58:06] mother-in-law said absolutely refused
[58:08] and chastened him and said you'll not
[58:10] take my daughter and drag her from
[58:11] Pillar To Post and he heeded to to the
[58:15] to the
[58:16] not really advice but to the commands of
[58:19] his mother-in-law
[58:21] and because of that decision he lost his
[58:24] wife and he lost his baby
[58:26] is that right
[58:28] but it was God's will that he goes out
[58:30] to the people it was God's will that he
[58:32] launches out in the ministry amen but he
[58:35] made the wrong decision and he said so
[58:37] himself
[58:38] because of that
[58:40] but but that decision can never change
[58:44] God's decision
[58:46] God now brought a correction and brought
[58:49] a humility and he and he brought a son
[58:51] amen a Brokenness in the Sun that now
[58:54] wants nothing else to listen to no other
[58:56] voice no mother-in-law nobody else but
[58:58] only wants to follow the leading of God
[59:02] and so that wrong decision still works
[59:04] together for good
[59:06] but it can't ever change God's ultimate
[59:08] plan
[59:10] if you'll turn with me to the Book of
[59:12] Ruth
[59:13] I want to keep looking at some of these
[59:15] examples
[59:16] as we work our way through
[59:21] and pray that God will help us glean for
[59:23] our own lives
[59:26] when we go through these examples we
[59:28] don't go just to read stories
[59:31] read things from the past and
[59:33] we're trying to find instruction for the
[59:36] day we're living in now
[59:37] we're wanting to seek God we want
[59:39] answers we want God to show us in the
[59:41] lives of of what he's done in the past
[59:43] with his Saints we want him to tell us
[59:45] what he's doing with us now
[59:48] so he says in Ruth
[59:52] sorry I gotta find it here
[59:55] in Ruth chapter 1 verse 11.
[59:59] Ruth chapter 1 verse 11.
[1:00:03] and Naomi said turn again my daughters
[1:00:05] why will you go with me are there yet
[1:00:07] any more sons in my womb that they may
[1:00:10] be your husbands turn again my daughters
[1:00:12] go your way for I am too old to have a
[1:00:14] husband if I should say I have hope if I
[1:00:17] should have a husband also tonight and
[1:00:19] should also bear Sons would you tarry
[1:00:21] for them till they are grown would you
[1:00:23] stay for them from having from having
[1:00:25] husbands name my daughters for it
[1:00:27] grieveth me much for your sakes that the
[1:00:29] hand of the Lord has gone out against me
[1:00:31] and they lifted up their voice and they
[1:00:33] wept again and orpa kissed her
[1:00:35] mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her
[1:00:38] and she said behold thy sister-in-law
[1:00:40] has gone back unto her people and unto
[1:00:42] her Gods return Thou after thy
[1:00:44] sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me
[1:00:46] not to leave thee or to return from
[1:00:48] following after thee for with or thou
[1:00:50] goest I will go and whether thou largest
[1:00:52] I will Lodge thy people shall be my
[1:00:54] people and thy God my God where thou
[1:00:57] dieth will I die and there will I be
[1:00:59] buried the Lord do so to me and more
[1:01:01] also of ought but death part me in thee
[1:01:04] part thee in me then she she saw that
[1:01:08] she was steadfastly minded to go with
[1:01:10] her then she left speaking unto her
[1:01:14] here we have the story of of Naomi and
[1:01:17] her husband
[1:01:18] they went down into the land of Moab
[1:01:20] because of famine they moved into the
[1:01:22] land of Moab and their sons married
[1:01:25] moabitish women and and now the sons die
[1:01:28] and affliction comes and all the men are
[1:01:30] dead and now his husband and the two
[1:01:32] sons are dead and Naomi doesn't
[1:01:34] understand why this has all come to pass
[1:01:37] amen and it's all come to pass because
[1:01:39] God needs her to make a decision to go
[1:01:41] back to the Homeland
[1:01:43] amen but but she's not to go back alone
[1:01:46] but there's one more that needs to go
[1:01:48] with her but that other one's not going
[1:01:50] to be forced she's going to make her own
[1:01:51] choice
[1:01:52] because that's how God works amen
[1:01:54] because the holy spirit is a gentleman
[1:01:56] he doesn't Force anyone
[1:01:59] now the whole scene plays out they're
[1:02:02] coming out of the land and now Naomi's
[1:02:04] telling them there's no hope for you
[1:02:06] girls amen I cannot bear you another son
[1:02:08] Amen to replace the husbands you've lost
[1:02:11] if I had a husband today and I became
[1:02:13] pregnant today would you wait 18 19 20
[1:02:16] years to have a no you go back to your
[1:02:19] Homeland and there was two women there
[1:02:21] and they each made a different choice
[1:02:24] they made a different decision and one
[1:02:26] decided to go back what was her what was
[1:02:29] her motive for going back
[1:02:30] self-preservation
[1:02:33] she Naomi already told her I'm destitute
[1:02:35] I'm desolate I have nothing I have
[1:02:37] nothing to offer you if you come with me
[1:02:39] you'll have nothing
[1:02:40] so she decided that's not the life I
[1:02:43] want
[1:02:44] I want something out of life so she goes
[1:02:47] back amen but Ruth was willing to give
[1:02:49] up her life amen she had a genuine love
[1:02:52] for Naomi that superseded her love for
[1:02:54] self
[1:02:55] and she began to make this decision I'll
[1:02:58] go with you don't make me leave you
[1:03:00] where you go all go where you live I'll
[1:03:02] live where you die I'll die your God
[1:03:03] will be my God your people my what did
[1:03:06] she say I'm not turning back I'm not
[1:03:08] going any other way she made a clean-cut
[1:03:10] decision
[1:03:12] when President preaches Amen on this he
[1:03:14] preaches the four phases of Ruth he
[1:03:16] preaches Ruth deciding Ruth working and
[1:03:19] all these things but she had to make a
[1:03:21] clear-cut decision and that decision
[1:03:23] brought a whole sequence of events in
[1:03:26] her life
[1:03:28] not one decision little did she know how
[1:03:31] could she at that time know that that
[1:03:33] decision she made would make her in the
[1:03:36] lineage of Christ one of the mothers of
[1:03:37] Christ she would bring forth Obed and oh
[1:03:40] better bring forth Jesse and Jesse would
[1:03:41] bring forth King David she was going to
[1:03:43] be a mother of the king line
[1:03:46] how could she know that she didn't know
[1:03:48] that she was just moved by her love for
[1:03:50] Naomi and she made a clear-cut decision
[1:03:53] she wasn't waffling she wasn't in
[1:03:55] between she wasn't saying I'll go along
[1:03:57] for a while and see how it pans out if
[1:03:59] she had decided that way she would have
[1:04:01] left when she was beating out her own
[1:04:03] barley in the field
[1:04:05] because it wasn't an easy way it wasn't
[1:04:07] an easy Road and I'm telling you I think
[1:04:10] so many times people follow this message
[1:04:12] wishy-washy amen and said I'm going to
[1:04:14] go along or I'll go to this church or
[1:04:16] I'll make this decision or I'll go along
[1:04:18] amen because we've seen when troubles
[1:04:20] come they vanish amen when things go
[1:04:22] south and when things go sour when
[1:04:24] churches fail when Ministries fail amen
[1:04:27] when it looks like amen the prophet's
[1:04:29] Ministries Family they all vanish away
[1:04:31] amen but I I want to make a clear-cut
[1:04:34] decision and say this is the truth this
[1:04:37] is Christ amen
[1:04:39] I'll live in this message I'll die in
[1:04:42] this message I'll die believing this
[1:04:44] message
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:48] and as soon as she made that decision
[1:04:50] she already declared what she was going
[1:04:52] to do and she was never going to depart
[1:04:54] from Naomi
[1:04:56] and they go back into the land and it's
[1:04:57] not like all of a sudden they show up
[1:04:59] amen and they get housing and they get a
[1:05:01] stipend and they get a government
[1:05:03] support checking
[1:05:07] they go into the they return home
[1:05:09] desolate
[1:05:12] Naomi amen is too old to work in the
[1:05:15] fields now Ruth is going out and she's
[1:05:17] laboring to bring forth a morsel of
[1:05:19] bread so that they could survive day by
[1:05:21] day
[1:05:23] he goes out and she she's gleaning she's
[1:05:26] going behind the Reapers just finding
[1:05:28] little bits
[1:05:29] and she would gather lap fulls of those
[1:05:32] little bits and she would go herself and
[1:05:34] she would at the end of the day have to
[1:05:35] beat it out herself Amen to separate the
[1:05:37] shock and the hall from the seed and
[1:05:39] gather the seed into her apron and take
[1:05:42] just enough back for them to eat
[1:05:44] then the next day she would have to do
[1:05:46] the same and the next day she would do
[1:05:47] the same why was she doing this because
[1:05:49] action follows decision
[1:05:52] it wasn't a wishy-washy decision so
[1:05:55] therefore her action wasn't Meandering
[1:05:58] it wasn't wondering she was decided
[1:06:00] this was decided action amen and the
[1:06:03] action was following her decision
[1:06:08] orpa may have had it much better
[1:06:12] maybe in that days if there's some sort
[1:06:14] of mail carrier and they can write one
[1:06:16] another and and can you imagine uh Ruth
[1:06:19] getting a letter from orpa I'm so glad I
[1:06:22] turned back God has given me a good
[1:06:24] husband I have a nice house and he's the
[1:06:26] mayor of the city and we have this and
[1:06:28] oh by the way I bought a brand new sofa
[1:06:30] the other day I hope you can come see it
[1:06:33] yep
[1:06:34] and Ruth with the clear-cut decision is
[1:06:36] suffering and suffering
[1:06:42] praise God
[1:06:45] sometimes you make the right choice and
[1:06:47] all it brings is suffering
[1:06:49] still the right choice
[1:06:52] still the right choice
[1:06:54] it doesn't automatically instantly bring
[1:06:56] uh uh piles of lavishness and rewards
[1:07:00] and you think if I make the right choice
[1:07:02] if I make the choice for God and I make
[1:07:03] the right choice it'll be instantly no
[1:07:05] most the time that decision has to be
[1:07:07] tested
[1:07:09] to see what kind of decision that is is
[1:07:12] it a clear-cut decision
[1:07:13] are we going to waffle
[1:07:16] amen after the decision the test always
[1:07:19] comes
[1:07:22] the mayor says
[1:07:24] in the message Redeemer and Redemption
[1:07:26] from 1955 said that Ruth not so a type
[1:07:29] of the Bride when her mother-in-law said
[1:07:31] now Ruth you turned back she said as the
[1:07:33] Lord liveth I'll not leave you I'll go
[1:07:35] with you your people will be my people
[1:07:36] your God shall be my God and where you
[1:07:39] die I'll die where you're buried I'll be
[1:07:41] buried make you making making her choice
[1:07:43] that's where every man has to come to in
[1:07:46] life sometimes is make a decision
[1:07:51] you have to make a choice
[1:07:54] you had to make a choice whether you was
[1:07:55] going to have an education or you have
[1:07:57] to make a choice who's going to be your
[1:07:58] wife you had to there has to be
[1:08:01] decisions and choices made in life
[1:08:05] sometimes we live in such a way
[1:08:08] that we allow the world to make all our
[1:08:10] choices for us
[1:08:13] because we get caught into a stream of
[1:08:15] life and life has a certain movement to
[1:08:17] it amen you get up and you work and news
[1:08:20] happens and things change and you buy
[1:08:22] groceries and you cut grass and you
[1:08:25] and there's a certain you can get caught
[1:08:28] I'd say in the current or stream of life
[1:08:30] and that life can just kind of carry us
[1:08:32] along and we can let the culture and let
[1:08:34] life and let those around us kind of
[1:08:35] make the decisions for us and we're just
[1:08:37] kind of Meandering along with the stream
[1:08:39] and flow of life
[1:08:43] sometimes we need to stop and ask
[1:08:44] ourselves do I want to go the way this
[1:08:47] world is going
[1:08:49] is that the direction I want to go in if
[1:08:52] I don't want to go in that direction
[1:08:53] then I've got to make some decisions for
[1:08:56] myself and those decisions have to bring
[1:08:58] me sometimes very character to the
[1:09:00] culture going absolutely the opposite
[1:09:01] direction
[1:09:03] that doesn't always create ease of life
[1:09:06] and sometimes creates great difficulty
[1:09:08] amen but I I don't want to be one of
[1:09:10] those who lets life make decisions for
[1:09:12] me amen but I want to come by the word
[1:09:14] of God and my faith in God and I I want
[1:09:17] to exercise the free moral agencies he's
[1:09:19] given me and I want to choose the word I
[1:09:21] want to choose the way with the despised
[1:09:23] few
[1:09:27] don't want to just go along and and see
[1:09:29] what happens and then I'll make my
[1:09:31] decision you're going to find out
[1:09:32] nothing ever happens
[1:09:35] you always stay in this murky gray in
[1:09:37] between kind of a way
[1:09:40] constantly sitting on the limb where two
[1:09:42] ways meet the world and the word
[1:09:46] constantly finding ourselves in this
[1:09:48] position why because we never made a
[1:09:50] clear-cut decision
[1:09:53] that clear-cut decision brings
[1:09:55] consequences
[1:09:56] but it brings actions
[1:09:58] and those actions move us into a
[1:10:00] different place
[1:10:02] amen
[1:10:04] so we have
[1:10:06] there has to be decisions and choices
[1:10:08] made in life sometimes we have to ask
[1:10:10] ourselves what do I want out of life
[1:10:14] somebody's good just to stop for a
[1:10:16] minute and what do I want
[1:10:19] what do I want my life to be like too
[1:10:21] many of us we especially when we were
[1:10:24] young we never stopped to think of that
[1:10:26] we we never stopped when it come time to
[1:10:29] make choices about education they make
[1:10:31] choices about spouses brother bam says
[1:10:33] that the kind of wife you choose
[1:10:35] reflects what's in a man and what his
[1:10:37] goals are amen not just the one who will
[1:10:39] talk to you and the prettiest one in the
[1:10:41] group and and those sort of things amen
[1:10:43] but actually sit down and say what do I
[1:10:46] want
[1:10:47] what do I want my family to look like
[1:10:49] what do I want my home to be like what
[1:10:50] do I want my children to be like
[1:10:53] and stop for a minute and quit letting
[1:10:55] life make choices for us and start
[1:10:57] making choices based off what we know in
[1:11:00] the word
[1:11:03] praise God
[1:11:05] and not constantly kicking the can down
[1:11:08] the road I'll see what happens I'll see
[1:11:09] what happens I'll see what happens I'll
[1:11:10] see what happens 40 years from now
[1:11:12] you'll be wanting to see what happens
[1:11:15] just in the Natural Things amen and the
[1:11:18] natural things with natural people I
[1:11:20] mean so many people say I'm not going to
[1:11:22] worry about retirement when I get there
[1:11:23] I'll figure it out and they get there
[1:11:25] and they wish that they could go back 30
[1:11:26] or 40 years and start making plans for
[1:11:28] retirement
[1:11:30] kicking that can down the road didn't do
[1:11:33] him any good
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:36] so that's just in the natural
[1:11:39] but in the spiritual I don't want to
[1:11:40] wake up 20 years from now and say where
[1:11:42] have I been what have I done what have I
[1:11:44] done for the Lord what have I done for
[1:11:46] somebody else amen I've lived a selfish
[1:11:48] lives I've been wishy-washy I've been in
[1:11:50] between I've been a church member but
[1:11:52] not a bride
[1:11:55] don't want to be there I want to make
[1:11:56] decisions and say the decisions Ruth's
[1:12:00] made were the decisions that kept her
[1:12:02] making decisions
[1:12:07] when Ruth made the decision to follow
[1:12:09] Naomi it forced her to make the decision
[1:12:11] to work for her annoying me and that
[1:12:14] decision that caused her to work for
[1:12:16] Naomi had her light upon the field of
[1:12:18] Boaz
[1:12:19] and then Boaz says don't go into any
[1:12:22] other field stay here so she had that
[1:12:24] decision led to another decision that
[1:12:26] led to this decision to stay here
[1:12:28] and knowing me advisor don't go anywhere
[1:12:30] else you stay there so she decided to
[1:12:32] obey Naomi because she had already
[1:12:33] attached herself to Naomi one decision
[1:12:35] leads to the next
[1:12:37] to the next to the next
[1:12:40] until Naomi finally gives her some
[1:12:42] instruction one day and she decides to
[1:12:44] listen to Naomi and listening to Naomi
[1:12:46] she goes to the threshing floor at night
[1:12:47] amen she says what she's supposed to say
[1:12:49] amen and her decisions all along pushed
[1:12:53] Boaz into a decision
[1:12:58] foreign
[1:12:59] how did she get on the threshing floor
[1:13:00] it started way back when they were
[1:13:02] leaving Moab
[1:13:07] where are we today spiritually and how
[1:13:09] did we get there there were some
[1:13:10] decisions made way back
[1:13:12] and we find ourselves good if we find
[1:13:14] ourselves bad wherever we find ourselves
[1:13:16] where we want to be here where we don't
[1:13:17] want to be amen it wasn't just
[1:13:19] circumstances that happened it was
[1:13:21] decisions that we made have us where we
[1:13:24] are now
[1:13:25] we made decisions and those decisions
[1:13:27] caused us to make other decisions and
[1:13:29] cause us to make other decisions
[1:13:33] remember that I said I I was I said some
[1:13:37] time ago I don't remember but I said the
[1:13:39] difference between me and the drug
[1:13:41] addict and the drunk and the gutter is
[1:13:43] maybe three or four bad decisions
[1:13:46] because one decision will force you into
[1:13:49] another decision
[1:13:51] that'll force you into another decision
[1:13:53] amen and I say God Amen well I have the
[1:13:57] ability well I have a right mind well
[1:13:59] I'm standing in a place where I can't I
[1:14:02] want to choose the word above everything
[1:14:03] else I want to choose this word that
[1:14:06] you've restored in this day through a
[1:14:07] prophet and I want that to be my guide
[1:14:09] and I want this scripture that's come
[1:14:11] back and been restored to the church to
[1:14:13] be my absolute and I want to subject
[1:14:15] myself to that
[1:14:17] just as much as Ruth amen attached
[1:14:19] herself to Naomi I want to attach myself
[1:14:21] to this word which is Christ my husband
[1:14:23] the headship and say where you go I'll
[1:14:26] go what you say I'll do what you
[1:14:28] instruct I'll all obey
[1:14:30] I want to do it now while I have the
[1:14:32] ability to make the choice and then not
[1:14:35] see what happens and then choose I don't
[1:14:37] want to wait and see what happens I want
[1:14:38] to choose now because what I choose now
[1:14:41] will dictate what happens next
[1:14:45] and one choice leads to another choice
[1:14:48] and the decisions we make today will
[1:14:50] cause us to make other decisions later
[1:14:53] and if I made that decision amen and
[1:14:56] surrendered back to Christ a hundred
[1:14:58] percent
[1:14:59] then that's going to push me into
[1:15:01] another decision because that decision
[1:15:03] will bring me to another Junction where
[1:15:04] I have to separate from unbelief
[1:15:10] how did I get to this decision because I
[1:15:12] made the first decision
[1:15:15] I have to break relationships I'll have
[1:15:17] to move maybe I may have to move
[1:15:19] locations I may have to I may have to
[1:15:21] whatever
[1:15:23] I may have to cut Family Ties I may have
[1:15:24] to do different things how did I get
[1:15:26] here because I made that decision that
[1:15:28] decision will help me make this decision
[1:15:32] praise
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:37] I don't want just to let life happen and
[1:15:39] figure it out I want to make my decision
[1:15:42] well God's given me the right to make my
[1:15:44] decision
[1:15:47] a whole lot of indecision has caused us
[1:15:50] to make irrational decisions
[1:15:54] and those quick decisions and irrational
[1:15:56] decisions have got us in trouble and
[1:15:58] that decision will lead to another
[1:16:00] decision
[1:16:01] and lead to another decision
[1:16:04] next thing you know you're so far away
[1:16:06] from where you ever wanted to be
[1:16:09] your life is in such a place you thought
[1:16:11] I would I never thought when I was a 16
[1:16:14] 17 year old young man or a 16 17 year
[1:16:17] old woman I never dreamed that I'd be
[1:16:19] here
[1:16:20] I never dreamed that I'd have a broken
[1:16:21] family I never dreamed that I would have
[1:16:24] this contention I never dreamed that I'd
[1:16:25] have these habits in my life I never
[1:16:27] dreamed that I'd have these vices
[1:16:29] I never dreamed then that I would be
[1:16:31] aware but I made choices then that are
[1:16:33] causing me to make choices now
[1:16:38] you young people you're in a golden spot
[1:16:42] you're in a beautiful spot amen but but
[1:16:45] you're moving beyond the age of
[1:16:46] accountability somewhere in 12 13 14 and
[1:16:49] you're moving to a place where God's
[1:16:50] holding you accountable for the
[1:16:52] decisions you make
[1:16:54] I tell you with all that's in me amen
[1:16:57] choose God choose Christ choose this
[1:16:59] word stick with the message amen with
[1:17:01] all that's in me make it your own choice
[1:17:03] not somebody else's choice not my choice
[1:17:05] make it your choice
[1:17:07] don't just wait and see what happens
[1:17:09] don't kick the can down the road make it
[1:17:11] your choice
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:17] to many young people we've seen them
[1:17:20] they they delayed making that choice
[1:17:23] they were part of the church part of the
[1:17:26] message because their parents were part
[1:17:27] of the message
[1:17:29] they they believed intellectually they
[1:17:31] believed because they were taught to
[1:17:32] believe and but but when they got a
[1:17:35] little more freedom and they moved out
[1:17:36] from Mom and Dad's house they had never
[1:17:38] made a clear-cut decision
[1:17:40] and so when they when they moved to Mom
[1:17:42] and Dad's house they get married and one
[1:17:44] of the first things they do is buy a TV
[1:17:46] now that's not nowadays because
[1:17:47] everybody's got computers but way back
[1:17:49] when
[1:17:51] first thing to do is buy a TV
[1:17:54] and because now they can make their own
[1:17:56] choices but that choice leads to another
[1:17:58] choice
[1:18:01] and leads to another choice
[1:18:05] and and now we find the young people
[1:18:08] they'll marry one another they were
[1:18:10] believers they looked apart they acted
[1:18:12] the part they sang in church they said
[1:18:14] amen to the word but because they never
[1:18:16] made a clear-cut decision when they come
[1:18:18] to the age of accountability amen and
[1:18:20] they moved forward and just kept
[1:18:21] delaying a full commitment delaying a
[1:18:23] full commitment amen so many of them
[1:18:26] their lives are in ruin right now
[1:18:28] they have broken homes broken families
[1:18:30] don't believe the word
[1:18:33] are dealing with all kinds of
[1:18:35] consequences
[1:18:38] why
[1:18:39] because decisions lead to decisions
[1:18:43] and while you have the chance to make
[1:18:45] the decision don't delay don't wait and
[1:18:47] see what happened don't say I want to
[1:18:48] get married first and I want to try a
[1:18:49] few of these things first and I want to
[1:18:51] experience a little bit of Life first
[1:18:52] you don't want any of that because all
[1:18:54] of those choices will lead you to other
[1:18:55] choices
[1:18:56] every one of those decisions will cause
[1:18:58] you to have to make another decision
[1:19:03] but I say make the decision like Ruth
[1:19:05] made and make it fast and make it first
[1:19:07] and make it right out of the shoot and
[1:19:09] make it make a decided effort to say
[1:19:11] this is the way for me it's going to be
[1:19:13] everybody else can do what they want but
[1:19:15] I am taking the way of the word
[1:19:19] and just making that commitment and
[1:19:22] making that decision will cause you to
[1:19:24] make another decision
[1:19:26] it'll cause you when you come to the
[1:19:28] hour of Temptation because you will come
[1:19:29] to the hour of Temptation amen when you
[1:19:31] come to your own Junction where you're
[1:19:33] sitting at the fork of a tree amen and
[1:19:35] you can go the way of pleasure
[1:19:37] or you can go the way of the word
[1:19:40] because you already made a declaration
[1:19:42] that I'm going to go with the word
[1:19:44] that'll cause you to make another
[1:19:46] decision when you come to the crooks of
[1:19:48] the street
[1:19:49] but if you've never made that decision
[1:19:51] before and you come now and you're
[1:19:53] sitting where two ways meet your ways in
[1:19:55] God's way and you never gave up your
[1:19:57] life and gave it to Christ and you never
[1:19:59] made your decision for him in the word
[1:20:01] when you get to this place amen the
[1:20:03] world and the Temptations and the lust
[1:20:04] of the flesh amen they'll begin to move
[1:20:06] on you and you'll find yourself making
[1:20:08] another choice
[1:20:11] and then that decision it may seem so
[1:20:13] simple and so innocent but that decision
[1:20:15] will cause you to make another decision
[1:20:19] how many young women would love if they
[1:20:22] could get their virginity back
[1:20:26] they gave it away they gave it away to
[1:20:28] somebody they thought loved them they
[1:20:30] gave it away to somebody they thought
[1:20:31] amen but but it was all lust it was all
[1:20:34] for pleasure
[1:20:36] it was all taking the way of self versus
[1:20:39] The Way of the word
[1:20:41] and how many women suffer for that the
[1:20:43] rest of their life that would allowed to
[1:20:44] take it back I tell you it was because
[1:20:46] you didn't make a decision that you made
[1:20:48] a decision
[1:20:49] if you had made a decision and say I'm
[1:20:51] going with the word regardless of what
[1:20:53] anybody else says
[1:20:55] amen
[1:20:56] and then and then then I make another
[1:20:59] decision if I decide to give myself to
[1:21:01] Christ into the word now I'm not going
[1:21:03] to give mine affections to any boy that
[1:21:05] comes down the road but that boy is
[1:21:06] going to have to have the same desire
[1:21:07] and commitment that I have and if he's
[1:21:09] got the same desired commitment I have
[1:21:11] he's not going to play with my emotions
[1:21:12] and play with my body amen so lack of a
[1:21:15] decision here causes a wrong decision
[1:21:17] here but the right decision here will
[1:21:19] cause you to make the right decision
[1:21:21] when you come to the junction
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:28] amen I mean this is practical
[1:21:30] this is where we get practical practical
[1:21:32] practical amen and sometimes maybe I'm
[1:21:35] too practical none of spiritual but I've
[1:21:36] been a pastor long enough that this is
[1:21:38] the way it is
[1:21:40] this is the way it actually is this is
[1:21:43] the reality of life we make choices we
[1:21:45] make decisions and God lets us do it
[1:21:48] amen will they work together for his
[1:21:50] glory absolutely will they bring
[1:21:52] correction will they bring lessons
[1:21:53] absolutely amen but will I have the
[1:21:55] opportunity and while you have the
[1:21:57] opportunity I encourage you to make the
[1:22:00] choice for the word and make your
[1:22:02] declaration and make your commitment and
[1:22:04] make it verbal and tell somebody else
[1:22:08] because the wishy-washy in between never
[1:22:11] making a clear-cut decision will cause
[1:22:13] you to make the wrong decision
[1:22:15] but when you begin to declare it to
[1:22:17] people this is what I want this is how
[1:22:19] I'm going to live this is the decision I
[1:22:21] make it'll help you make the next
[1:22:23] decision
[1:22:28] how many young men would love
[1:22:31] love to be able to take control back
[1:22:33] over their mind because they gave their
[1:22:35] mind over to lust
[1:22:38] by making decisions
[1:22:41] no just trapped and addictions
[1:22:45] and their mind takes in places they
[1:22:47] don't want to go
[1:22:49] because why because of decisions
[1:22:55] why didn't God stop me how many times
[1:22:57] have men and women cried God why didn't
[1:23:00] you stop me
[1:23:03] because he already gave you his word
[1:23:06] amen he didn't stop Israel when they
[1:23:08] decided to go into adultery because he
[1:23:09] already told him what would happen if
[1:23:10] they go into adult
[1:23:13] he already laid it out before them amen
[1:23:16] in Deuteronomy and Moses already said
[1:23:18] I've set before you life and death
[1:23:20] choose life
[1:23:22] and when they got to the place where
[1:23:24] they began to choose death
[1:23:26] God already gave them the privilege to
[1:23:28] make that choice he wasn't going to take
[1:23:31] it away
[1:23:33] and God is setting before us week after
[1:23:36] week sermon after sermon life and death
[1:23:40] and I say God help us to choose life
[1:23:43] help us to make a clear-cut choice and
[1:23:45] choose life not just come and listen and
[1:23:47] walk out listen and walk out listen and
[1:23:49] walk out but listen and choose listen
[1:23:51] and choose listen and choose
[1:23:54] decide I am going to surrender to the
[1:23:57] word
[1:24:01] amen we know in the
[1:24:04] in the Book of Genesis we know it's
[1:24:06] familiar I'm just going to skim through
[1:24:07] it in Genesis 13. we know there came a
[1:24:10] time a decision between Abraham and lot
[1:24:12] and Abraham had to move into the promise
[1:24:13] and there had to be a separation amen
[1:24:15] but lot was given the privilege of
[1:24:17] making his decision
[1:24:19] and Abraham said you go where you want
[1:24:21] you go to the right I'll go to the left
[1:24:22] you go to the left I'll go to the right
[1:24:26] and lot now was sitting at a junction
[1:24:29] where two ways meet
[1:24:31] and he had a decision to make where am I
[1:24:34] going to go and set up my camp
[1:24:37] and when he looked down at the plane of
[1:24:39] Sodom it was well watered like the
[1:24:41] garden of God like like Egypt
[1:24:44] and it was a great place for prosperity
[1:24:46] and it was a great place for wealth amen
[1:24:49] and he chose to pitch towards Sodom amen
[1:24:51] and I asked you was that a decision of
[1:24:53] self
[1:24:55] yes
[1:24:57] and that decision leads to more
[1:25:00] decisions
[1:25:02] and lot chose to pitch towards Sodom
[1:25:06] and lot he pitched his tent towards
[1:25:09] Sodom
[1:25:10] but later we find out he's in Sodom
[1:25:13] so just for a little personal gain just
[1:25:17] for a little Prosperity just for a
[1:25:19] little easier living and brother Brennan
[1:25:21] said it left it left Abraham up there in
[1:25:23] the rocky soil
[1:25:25] he got the he got the worst end of the
[1:25:28] deal he got the worst land amen but
[1:25:30] Abraham was blessed amen because he gave
[1:25:32] preference to law and lot chose wrong
[1:25:34] Abraham stayed and Abraham was blessed
[1:25:38] yeah
[1:25:39] so lot makes a choice for a little bit
[1:25:42] easier life a little bit easier way and
[1:25:45] that choice doesn't have him pitched or
[1:25:47] Sodom and that choice has him inside him
[1:25:48] and and that choice has him marry off
[1:25:51] his daughters
[1:25:53] to Sodom my men
[1:25:56] and Sodom
[1:25:58] and then when it in the end it has lost
[1:26:00] heart turned towards the ways of Sodom
[1:26:03] and then in the end when he gets rescued
[1:26:06] out of that because God's going to
[1:26:07] rescue him for Abraham say when God
[1:26:09] rescues him out of that he's lost some
[1:26:11] of his daughters and his brother-in-law
[1:26:13] he loses his wife and he's left with two
[1:26:15] daughters
[1:26:18] sometimes we say well if I make a
[1:26:20] mistake God will correct me God will
[1:26:21] correct you but what will you lose
[1:26:24] what effect will it have I mean what in
[1:26:27] the interim between making the wrong
[1:26:29] decision and trusting God Amen to get
[1:26:31] you back on track when you know you're
[1:26:33] doing wrong amen
[1:26:34] let me people I mean I remember as a
[1:26:37] child I had this mentality I was raised
[1:26:38] in the Pentecostal church I was raised
[1:26:40] believing the Bible I was raised with a
[1:26:42] certain understanding of right and wrong
[1:26:43] and I had this understanding amen that
[1:26:46] that if I'm a Child of God I can always
[1:26:47] repent and it'll be okay
[1:26:50] I had that head knowledge
[1:26:52] amen and that caused me to make
[1:26:56] compromises
[1:26:57] because I knew if I Repent God would
[1:26:59] forgive me and those compromises have
[1:27:02] had lifetime effects
[1:27:04] mentally you're ashamed of things you
[1:27:06] did things you said actions you took
[1:27:11] you can't say it's depend on God to fix
[1:27:14] everything for you he'll fix it all
[1:27:15] right if you're a child of God you'll be
[1:27:17] saved if you're a child of God you'll
[1:27:18] not be lost amen but what will you
[1:27:20] suffer
[1:27:24] what will we suffer
[1:27:26] because we choose self
[1:27:29] what will the ones around us suffer what
[1:27:32] will our children suffer and what will
[1:27:34] our friends and what will all around us
[1:27:36] suffer because of the decisions we make
[1:27:42] we need to be all in
[1:27:45] First Kings 18.
[1:27:53] What a Sad spot to spend Years Around
[1:27:55] the message and still not know if it's
[1:27:57] true or not
[1:27:59] or if it can be trusted
[1:28:01] or if it's subject for all of life
[1:28:08] First Kings 18.
[1:28:14] First Kings 18
[1:28:16] verse 21.
[1:28:22] in First Kings 18 21 this is the Mount
[1:28:24] Carmel Showdown
[1:28:25] and Elijah came unto all the people and
[1:28:27] said how long halchi between two
[1:28:30] opinions
[1:28:31] if the Lord be God follow him but if
[1:28:34] bailed and follow him and the people who
[1:28:37] answered him not a word
[1:28:39] I think this is an amazing scripture
[1:28:42] Elijah comes up it wasn't that they
[1:28:45] weren't worshiping Jehovah
[1:28:49] he says why halt you between two
[1:28:51] opinions
[1:28:52] they were straddling the fence they were
[1:28:54] in the middle of the road amen if if God
[1:28:59] be God if Lord be God follow him if Baal
[1:29:02] be God follow him why are you mixing
[1:29:05] this thing together why are you in
[1:29:07] between why don't you make a clear-cut
[1:29:09] decision on one or the other
[1:29:11] this is where Elijah's bringing them
[1:29:12] Mount Carmel Showdown is bringing them
[1:29:15] to a clear-cut decision
[1:29:18] he says why halt you so the nation of
[1:29:21] Israel was halting between two opinions
[1:29:23] amen and that's exactly where the world
[1:29:25] was when the prophet showed up because
[1:29:26] they didn't understand what was wrong
[1:29:28] with all the denominationalism and the
[1:29:30] corruption of the word and changing the
[1:29:32] word and mixed man's ideas in with it he
[1:29:34] said why halt you between two opinions
[1:29:36] if the word is right trust the word if
[1:29:38] the church is right trust the church
[1:29:41] because that's where we were amen is the
[1:29:43] church writers the word right because
[1:29:44] the church has changed the word
[1:29:47] and it's mixed together they're using
[1:29:49] part of the word and dismissing part of
[1:29:51] it it become mixed why halt you between
[1:29:53] two opinions is the Bible writers the
[1:29:55] Bible wrong
[1:29:58] amen why halt you between two opinions
[1:30:00] when Peter said repent and be baptized
[1:30:03] and then in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:05] Christ was he right or was he wrong
[1:30:08] because you talk to people and say well
[1:30:09] Peter said this way Jesus said it this
[1:30:12] way I'll take what Jesus said
[1:30:16] well you understand that mentality when
[1:30:19] we go down that road then all of a
[1:30:20] sudden we've said Peter after being up
[1:30:22] in the upper room filled with the Holy
[1:30:24] Ghost which is supposed to lead and
[1:30:25] guide him into all truth immediately
[1:30:26] after that he will teach false Doctrine
[1:30:28] on the opening message of the inaugural
[1:30:31] message of the new church
[1:30:33] so what you've just done is you've just
[1:30:35] declared Peter amen Peter's not right
[1:30:38] here Jesus is right here and then the
[1:30:40] question is what else does Peter have
[1:30:42] wrong
[1:30:44] and if Paul's a woman hater and never
[1:30:46] been married and not really somebody we
[1:30:48] need to listen to on the subject of
[1:30:50] marriage and divorcing of women then
[1:30:51] what else did Paul have wrong all of a
[1:30:54] sudden amen the whole world is standing
[1:30:56] here between the church and the word
[1:30:57] amen and the question is why halt you
[1:30:59] between two opinions either the word is
[1:31:02] absolutely right or the church is
[1:31:03] absolutely right pick one
[1:31:07] and Elijah showed up in this day in this
[1:31:11] scenario in this scene and he's standing
[1:31:13] on on a Mount Zion Showdown and he's
[1:31:15] saying you pick it's the word or the
[1:31:17] church you can't have both
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:24] and we see that in the laodicean church
[1:31:25] age he says because you're neither Luke
[1:31:28] you're neither hot or cold but lukewarm
[1:31:30] I'll speed you out you're mixing you're
[1:31:32] in between God doesn't want in between
[1:31:34] he wants you red hot or ice cold declare
[1:31:37] where you're at
[1:31:39] make your decision and declare where
[1:31:40] you're at it's either right or it's
[1:31:42] wrong it's either true or it's false
[1:31:43] quit mixing
[1:31:45] [Music]
[1:31:48] and so that's the condition of the
[1:31:50] Legacy in church age mixing and that's
[1:31:52] what gets spewed out of his mouth
[1:31:55] praise God brother man says in the
[1:31:58] message spiritual Amnesia he says so
[1:32:00] sorry so so worry has no virtue in it at
[1:32:04] all but faith has all virtue believe now
[1:32:07] where he sometimes causes it and what do
[1:32:09] you mean by calls it he's saying
[1:32:10] spiritual Amnesia he said Amnesia and
[1:32:12] naturally said can be caused by over
[1:32:14] worry it can be caused by stress he
[1:32:16] starts talking about what can cause
[1:32:18] Amnesia and this is the message
[1:32:19] spiritually amnesia
[1:32:21] and he goes now he says and another
[1:32:23] thing that causes it among the people is
[1:32:25] getting between two opinions
[1:32:29] that'll cause amnesia
[1:32:31] and it gets you to a place where you
[1:32:33] actually what you've done you've lost
[1:32:35] your reasons you've lost your mind you
[1:32:37] don't know who you are you can't
[1:32:39] identify yourself you can walk around
[1:32:41] eating everything but you still you
[1:32:43] can't identify yourself why this is
[1:32:45] amnesia and now he's talking about
[1:32:47] spiritual Amnesia and what can cause
[1:32:48] Amnesia you can get halt between two
[1:32:51] opinions
[1:32:54] and here the nation of Israel they were
[1:32:56] halt between two opinions and they were
[1:32:57] in spiritual Amnesia they forgot what
[1:33:00] Moses said they forgot what God had done
[1:33:02] they forgot all the Miracles and they'd
[1:33:04] forgotten who they were supposed to be
[1:33:05] they were supposed to be the Oracles of
[1:33:08] God
[1:33:08] they were supposed to be the display of
[1:33:11] God on the earth through working through
[1:33:12] a nation
[1:33:13] they were supposed to project the light
[1:33:15] of the Lord to the world they were
[1:33:17] supposed to be a light set on the hill
[1:33:18] projecting the very nature of God to the
[1:33:21] whole world and here they are in
[1:33:22] spiritual Amnesia forgetting who they
[1:33:24] really are amen confused and now they
[1:33:27] worshiping Baal and worshiping Jehovah
[1:33:28] and then the lines are blurred somewhere
[1:33:31] in between here
[1:33:32] just like in this day the bride has lost
[1:33:34] touch of who she is amen and we come in
[1:33:37] the laodice CNAs the prophet had to come
[1:33:39] Amen to break the spiritual Amnesia of
[1:33:42] the church because they didn't know if
[1:33:43] they were methodists they didn't know if
[1:33:44] they were Baptist they didn't know if
[1:33:46] there were Pentecostals they didn't know
[1:33:47] if all were okay they didn't know who
[1:33:48] they were and they didn't realize that
[1:33:50] they are the word
[1:33:54] and so he came not so he could halt
[1:33:56] between two opinions but so that we
[1:33:59] could make our decision amen and break
[1:34:01] spiritually Amnesia and come back to the
[1:34:03] word of God
[1:34:06] to be the word
[1:34:08] so being hot between hot between two if
[1:34:11] he's not making a clear-cut decision
[1:34:13] will bring spiritual Amnesia where you
[1:34:15] can't even clearly identify Who You Are
[1:34:20] we know that Elijah comes to Mount
[1:34:23] Carmel
[1:34:24] and he comes in obedience to the word of
[1:34:27] God and He does everything God says he
[1:34:28] pours the water on he lays the sacrifice
[1:34:30] he does it all
[1:34:32] the prophets of Baal they and the
[1:34:34] priests they tried and they couldn't get
[1:34:35] any fire to come down and all of a
[1:34:37] sudden fire comes down and licks up the
[1:34:39] water and the sacrifice and the stones
[1:34:41] and all
[1:34:43] and in First Kings 18 39 says and when
[1:34:45] all the people saw it they fell on their
[1:34:48] faces and they said the Lord he is God
[1:34:50] the Lord he is God
[1:34:54] they knew then
[1:34:56] they weren't halt between two opinions
[1:34:58] anymore
[1:34:59] they saw who was God
[1:35:03] the same things happen to us friends
[1:35:06] God has showed himself
[1:35:09] and he showed who's gone
[1:35:11] they showed where God is and God is his
[1:35:13] word
[1:35:15] not just mixing this blending this
[1:35:17] denominational Church idea he's his word
[1:35:21] and through a prophet he showed us amen
[1:35:24] I say God help us to bow on our faces
[1:35:26] and say he the Lord he is gone
[1:35:29] and I will devote my whole life to him
[1:35:32] and nothing else
[1:35:35] amen and the message choosing of a bride
[1:35:39] brother says you have also a choice when
[1:35:41] you choose this church you can choose
[1:35:42] whether in this church whether you will
[1:35:44] choose a church that will guide you to
[1:35:46] your Eternal destination you can choose
[1:35:48] a church that has a certain Creed that
[1:35:49] you might think that Creed is just what
[1:35:51] you want or the other church has their
[1:35:53] Creed and then there is the word of God
[1:35:55] you have a choice of you have to make
[1:35:57] the choice there's an unwritten law
[1:35:59] Among Us of choosing I believe it was
[1:36:02] Elijah one time up on Mount Carmel after
[1:36:04] The Showdown and a great hour of Crisis
[1:36:06] that we just about to come to right now
[1:36:09] perhaps it may be to you or I tonight
[1:36:11] that we make this Choice like the Mount
[1:36:13] Carmel experience frankly I think it's
[1:36:15] going on worldwide now but there will
[1:36:17] soon be a time where there you'll have
[1:36:19] to make a choice
[1:36:22] amen I don't I don't know what future
[1:36:25] holds but but remember so there's coming
[1:36:27] a time you have to make a choice and the
[1:36:28] choice you makes now will help you make
[1:36:30] the choice then
[1:36:32] the decision we make now will cause us
[1:36:34] to make another decision later
[1:36:38] man if we decide to stay with disbelief
[1:36:41] then we're going to make another
[1:36:43] decision later
[1:36:45] we decide to serve self we're going to
[1:36:47] make another decision later
[1:36:49] but if we like Ruth can make a decision
[1:36:54] I'm sacrificing all I am all I have all
[1:36:59] my life
[1:37:01] Ruth didn't say
[1:37:04] I'll go along with you and when I see
[1:37:06] that things are going to work out I'll
[1:37:08] go on Long further and if they don't
[1:37:10] work out I'm coming back
[1:37:14] see that's not going to work
[1:37:16] that's not going to work
[1:37:18] because when things got rough she would
[1:37:19] have just moseyed on back
[1:37:22] and how many times do we see people who
[1:37:24] make a commitment to serve Christ but
[1:37:26] when the first trial comes the first
[1:37:27] hardship comes they they wander back
[1:37:30] I said God help us I don't want to be
[1:37:32] that
[1:37:33] while I've Got My Mind straight while I
[1:37:36] know the word well I've got an
[1:37:37] opportunity I'm making my choice
[1:37:39] I'm making my decision
[1:37:43] brother man was
[1:37:45] had this experience and you'll remember
[1:37:48] where brother had preached the message
[1:37:50] and and a man by the name of Danny Henry
[1:37:53] comes up to him and he puts his arms
[1:37:54] around him and he begins to break out in
[1:37:56] tongues and he speaks French and there's
[1:37:57] three in the crowd that can speak French
[1:37:59] there's a woman from Louisiana there's
[1:38:01] Victor Ledoux and then there's an
[1:38:03] interpreter for the United Nations and
[1:38:05] they all give the same interpretation of
[1:38:06] what Danny Henry spoke in French and I'm
[1:38:09] going to read just a small portion
[1:38:10] and he says because thou has chosen this
[1:38:13] straighten their way the harder way
[1:38:15] you've done it at your own choosing
[1:38:18] but what a glorious decision you've made
[1:38:22] because it's my way
[1:38:24] brother Brennan wasn't forced to go
[1:38:26] God's way
[1:38:28] but he decided to go God's way
[1:38:30] and God spoke back to him and said what
[1:38:32] a glorious decision you have made
[1:38:34] because it is my way
[1:38:38] he went ahead and said then this in
[1:38:42] itself is that which will bring to pass
[1:38:44] and make and bring to pass the
[1:38:45] tremendous victory in love divine
[1:38:49] he's taking the tremendous victory in
[1:38:51] love divine in attaching it to brother
[1:38:52] branham's decision
[1:38:56] because this is a momentous decision
[1:38:58] there's a glorious decision you made
[1:39:01] because it is my way and this in itself
[1:39:03] will bring to pass the great victory in
[1:39:06] Divine love my look at what was weighing
[1:39:09] on that man's decision
[1:39:12] look at the power of that decision was
[1:39:15] unlocked by that decision look at what
[1:39:17] that decision led to another decision in
[1:39:19] bra it brought us to the place we are
[1:39:21] today friends we're standing here
[1:39:22] preaching In a Pulpit we're sitting
[1:39:24] saying Amen to the word because that man
[1:39:26] made a decision
[1:39:28] that he wasn't forced to make that he
[1:39:30] did himself and he made a full
[1:39:32] commitment and a full surrender amen he
[1:39:34] got stopped the first time he was going
[1:39:36] to go out by his mother-in-law amen he
[1:39:38] cowered under her pressure and he made
[1:39:40] the wrong decision amen but when that
[1:39:41] thing come full circle when he made a
[1:39:43] decision he made a decision for good and
[1:39:45] he never backed off of that decision
[1:39:48] he went and it kept him going and kept
[1:39:50] him going and kept him going
[1:39:53] and you and I are here benefactors of
[1:39:56] that decision
[1:40:00] amen
[1:40:02] what if he had chose the easier way
[1:40:05] what do you chose the way that caused
[1:40:07] less rejection
[1:40:09] less personal pain
[1:40:11] less hardship to his family
[1:40:14] what if you chose the way that that
[1:40:16] allowed him more popularity in an easier
[1:40:18] life
[1:40:20] we wouldn't be standing here
[1:40:22] God would oh we would because it was
[1:40:24] ordained of God but he would have to
[1:40:25] change the whole thing again
[1:40:30] see the decisions we make are not just
[1:40:32] for ourselves
[1:40:34] but they affect everyone around us
[1:40:37] they affect our wives our husbands our
[1:40:40] children or our loved ones they affect
[1:40:42] all those around us
[1:40:45] we've got to be
[1:40:47] got to be wise we've got to look into
[1:40:49] the word we've got to be led by the
[1:40:51] spirit we've got to be decisive about
[1:40:53] what we do
[1:40:55] I I've come to the place where I I don't
[1:40:58] want to be a meanderer
[1:41:00] in life I want to be decisive
[1:41:04] I don't want to let life happen to me
[1:41:07] but I want to decide how I'm going to
[1:41:10] react I want to decide what I what I
[1:41:13] believe and what I believe I want to
[1:41:15] season every decision
[1:41:19] don't want to just get tossed about by
[1:41:22] every circumstance but I want my
[1:41:23] decision to hold me through all the
[1:41:26] circumstances
[1:41:28] Ruth's decision held her through
[1:41:30] everything
[1:41:32] stay true to what she had chose but she
[1:41:34] decided
[1:41:35] I want to stay true
[1:41:39] but it's not just
[1:41:42] brother branham's decision
[1:41:44] that brings great victories in the word
[1:41:46] of God
[1:41:47] it's ours too
[1:41:50] because God
[1:41:53] is going to have a bride Christ will
[1:41:55] have a bride
[1:41:56] and she will be submissive of her own
[1:42:00] choosing
[1:42:02] he's looking for a submissive bride and
[1:42:04] you'll never be bride unless he first
[1:42:05] decided your bride
[1:42:08] but he's looking for one that'll decide
[1:42:10] that he's the head and he only
[1:42:13] and I'm not he is that no other man is
[1:42:16] he is and that they'll surrender
[1:42:18] completely to the headship because
[1:42:20] that's what this that's what the
[1:42:22] sleeping Saints are waiting for
[1:42:25] is for this bride to come into
[1:42:26] perfection
[1:42:28] in Revelations chapter 17 verse 14 he
[1:42:30] says these these shall make war with the
[1:42:33] lamb and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:42:34] for he is Lord of lords king of kings
[1:42:36] and they that are with him are called
[1:42:38] and chosen and faithful another man
[1:42:41] begins to break this down in the fourth
[1:42:43] heel you're called by predestination
[1:42:45] you're chosen by election
[1:42:48] is that right you didn't have anything
[1:42:50] to do with that that was God
[1:42:51] but in the third attribute to these that
[1:42:54] are with him are faithful
[1:42:56] and that is what I want to look at
[1:42:58] brother Ben says in the fourth seal he
[1:43:00] says he's got wrote Life riding on a
[1:43:01] white horse and here's a man with three
[1:43:04] different powers mixed up Called Death
[1:43:05] gathered his Earthbound delegates in
[1:43:07] Christ is gathering his heaven-born
[1:43:09] subjects Saints he's got death wrote on
[1:43:12] him Christ's got life wrote on him those
[1:43:14] with him are on white horses also and
[1:43:16] they are called The Chosen before the
[1:43:18] foundation of the world and they are
[1:43:19] faithful to the word brother remember
[1:43:21] said amen I like that called chosen
[1:43:25] before the foundation world and then
[1:43:27] faithful to the word by their choosing
[1:43:31] the first two parts of that you had
[1:43:33] nothing to do with you were called you
[1:43:34] were chosen that's by predestination and
[1:43:36] election but that third part is faithful
[1:43:39] and he said faithful by their own
[1:43:40] choosing
[1:43:42] I said oh God help me to be faithful by
[1:43:45] my truth if I get to choose that's what
[1:43:47] I want to choose if it's my decision to
[1:43:49] make that's what I decide help me God
[1:43:51] forgive me for my wrong decisions help
[1:43:54] me
[1:43:55] Amen brother Madam says uh all the way
[1:43:58] back in 1958 and Queen of Sheba says God
[1:44:01] don't always work on the easy Road
[1:44:04] the things that's at your hand you have
[1:44:06] to struggle to do the will of God
[1:44:08] sometimes
[1:44:09] God don't work on the easy Road
[1:44:12] you have to struggle to do the will of
[1:44:13] God Amen if you're going to do that then
[1:44:15] you've got to decide ahead of time this
[1:44:17] is the way I'm taking
[1:44:18] because it's not going to be the easy
[1:44:20] Road it's going to be a struggle many
[1:44:22] times but you have to decide ahead of
[1:44:24] time that's the way I'm going
[1:44:27] he says in the message faithful Abraham
[1:44:29] from 55 he says now God's elect people
[1:44:33] over in the book of Ephesians the first
[1:44:35] chapter and about the fifth verse Paul
[1:44:36] States the word predestinated us to the
[1:44:39] adoption of sons now that doesn't mean
[1:44:41] that God just puts you in a little
[1:44:42] Channel and runs you through and you
[1:44:45] can't help how you go when you would
[1:44:47] then you would be no reward but God
[1:44:50] gives you the free moral agency to make
[1:44:52] your choice but God will keep us
[1:44:53] believer
[1:44:55] we're called predestinated but that
[1:44:57] doesn't mean brother said you're shoved
[1:44:59] through a pipe pulled out the other end
[1:45:00] and everything's glorious no then
[1:45:02] there's no reward
[1:45:04] God will keep the believer absolutely
[1:45:06] but you've got choices to make I've got
[1:45:08] choices to make
[1:45:09] and then there's a statement that
[1:45:11] brother Bennett makes in Jehovah Jireh
[1:45:12] says you're never too old to God as long
[1:45:14] as you've got surrendered heart and a
[1:45:17] will to do the will of God
[1:45:19] you have to have a surrendered heart and
[1:45:21] a will to do the will of God I said oh
[1:45:23] God I want to have a will to do your
[1:45:26] will
[1:45:27] as long as you've got a surrendered
[1:45:29] heart and a will to do the will of God
[1:45:30] God always will receive you no matter
[1:45:33] how old you are how young you are what
[1:45:35] does it take a surrendered heart and a
[1:45:37] will to do the will of God
[1:45:40] oh praise God
[1:45:43] again he says in marriage of the lamb
[1:45:45] from 1962.
[1:45:47] I mean he says if the Lord will take
[1:45:48] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:45:50] or from gambling or from lying or
[1:45:52] stealing I'll serve him but that's up to
[1:45:54] you
[1:45:56] see you got something to do too they
[1:45:59] that overcome shall inherit all things
[1:46:00] they that overcome you have power to do
[1:46:02] it but you must be willing to lay it
[1:46:04] down
[1:46:05] she has made herself ready I like that
[1:46:07] word you see God could not push us
[1:46:09] through a little pipe pull us out the
[1:46:11] other end and then say blessed is he
[1:46:13] that overcometh you had nothing to
[1:46:14] overcome he just pushed you through but
[1:46:17] you've got to make decisions for
[1:46:19] yourself
[1:46:20] you have the decision for myself I have
[1:46:22] to make decision for myself in doing
[1:46:24] that we show our faith and respects to
[1:46:26] God
[1:46:28] amen turn with me to the Book of Joshua
[1:46:35] Book of Joshua
[1:46:37] chapter 24.
[1:46:48] Joshua 24.
[1:46:53] in verse 14. Joshua 24 and 14.
[1:46:59] Joshua speaks is now therefore fear the
[1:47:01] lord and serve him in sincerity and in
[1:47:03] truth
[1:47:04] and put away the gods which your father
[1:47:06] served on the other side of the flood
[1:47:07] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[1:47:11] never seem evil unto you to serve the
[1:47:13] Lord choose you this day whom you will
[1:47:14] serve whether the gods with your father
[1:47:16] serve that were on the other side of the
[1:47:18] flood or the gods of the amorites and
[1:47:20] whose land you dwell but as for me in my
[1:47:23] house we will serve the Lord
[1:47:26] Joshua comes down and he poses a
[1:47:29] question to the people he put poses an
[1:47:31] opportunity to the whole congregation
[1:47:34] choose you this day who you'll serve
[1:47:36] you're going to serve the gods your
[1:47:38] father served if you want to serve the
[1:47:39] gods of the amorites and whose lands we
[1:47:40] go you can choose
[1:47:43] see they weren't forced
[1:47:45] you can choose to serve who you want to
[1:47:48] serve but he makes a clear-cut decision
[1:47:50] and he makes it verbal and he makes it
[1:47:52] vocal and he makes his claim he said but
[1:47:54] as for me in my house
[1:47:56] we will serve the Lord
[1:47:59] everybody else can do whatever they want
[1:48:01] amen everybody around us can do whatever
[1:48:02] they want but we meet may we have this
[1:48:05] kind of Revelation that says as for me
[1:48:07] and my house we will serve the Lord we
[1:48:09] will surrender to this word we will make
[1:48:11] our decision to stay with the message of
[1:48:13] the hour
[1:48:15] because God's word is true in every
[1:48:17] other man's word is a lie
[1:48:20] he says in remembering the Lord Brothers
[1:48:22] says I want to draw another little thing
[1:48:24] here it comes to my mind when Jesus was
[1:48:26] on trial and for nothing else but
[1:48:28] mockery sake he was sent from pilate to
[1:48:31] Heron from pilate didn't have to do that
[1:48:33] you know he tried to wash his hands of
[1:48:35] it but once on your hands you got to
[1:48:37] make your decision
[1:48:39] you can't push it on somebody else it's
[1:48:41] you as an individual
[1:48:44] he said when it came to pilate pilate
[1:48:46] did not want to condemn Jesus pilate
[1:48:48] knew something was fishy about this and
[1:48:50] they delivered him for envy and he
[1:48:52] didn't want this so when he finds out
[1:48:54] that he's of herod's jurisdiction that
[1:48:55] Galilean he sends him to Herod he wants
[1:48:57] Herod to make the decision because he
[1:48:59] doesn't want to make the decision
[1:49:01] and all this is human nature friends
[1:49:04] this is such human nature amen you want
[1:49:07] somebody else to make the decision so
[1:49:09] somebody else Bears the consequences for
[1:49:11] the decision sends him to Heron let her
[1:49:13] decide but Herod wouldn't choose Herod
[1:49:15] sent him back to Pilot because brother
[1:49:16] Branham said once he's on your hands
[1:49:18] he's on your hands you've got to make
[1:49:20] your decision God's not going to let us
[1:49:22] off so easy once it comes to our lap
[1:49:25] we've got to make our choice and I've
[1:49:27] seen already where people they'll come
[1:49:29] to a minister or come to a pastor and
[1:49:30] they want the pastor to make the choice
[1:49:32] for them so the pastor can bear the
[1:49:34] consequences for the choice
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:37] and I say God help me never to fall into
[1:49:40] that trap I say hey wait a minute this
[1:49:42] is this is your decision to make not my
[1:49:44] decision I'll show you the word what I
[1:49:46] see in the word but I cannot make these
[1:49:48] decisions for you amen because this is
[1:49:50] in your life amen but that's what we do
[1:49:52] we want a mom or a dad we want a parent
[1:49:54] we want an elder we want an older
[1:49:55] brother we want to minister We Trust we
[1:49:57] want a pastor we want somebody else to
[1:50:00] make the decision for us
[1:50:02] because if it doesn't go well
[1:50:05] then we can just
[1:50:07] they told me they said brother so-and-so
[1:50:10] said sister so and said my dad said it's
[1:50:13] not my fault
[1:50:15] but don't be surprised when that thing
[1:50:16] comes right back around the circle again
[1:50:18] winds up in your lap again
[1:50:20] because we've got to make our own
[1:50:23] personal choice and personal stand
[1:50:25] for the word
[1:50:28] I like I liked the way Ruth did it
[1:50:31] and I like the way Joshua did it
[1:50:34] you do whatever you want but I'm
[1:50:35] publicly declaring as for me and my
[1:50:37] house will serve the Lord
[1:50:39] because I've got to make a clear-cut
[1:50:41] decision
[1:50:43] then if we go in Joshua 24 on down after
[1:50:45] Joshua declares this and he lays it
[1:50:47] before the people you come to verse 21
[1:50:49] and the people send unto Joshua nay but
[1:50:52] we will serve the Lord
[1:50:55] and Joshua said unto the people you are
[1:50:57] witness against yourselves that ye have
[1:50:58] chosen you the Lord to serve him and
[1:51:01] they said we Are Witnesses
[1:51:04] they said not just you we're not going
[1:51:06] to serve any other God we're going to
[1:51:07] serve the Lord and he says now you've
[1:51:09] become a witness against yourself what
[1:51:11] you declared and say we're the winner
[1:51:12] we're making a public statement as well
[1:51:14] as you it's not just you it's me too
[1:51:17] that we will serve the Lord
[1:51:20] so this is the first generation now
[1:51:23] that's entering into Canaan land so
[1:51:25] let's go to judges and let's look now
[1:51:27] into judges
[1:51:32] Judges chapter 2.
[1:51:40] Judges chapter 2 verse 6.
[1:51:45] in Joshua in judges 2 and verse 6 he
[1:51:48] said and when Joshua had let the people
[1:51:49] go the children of Israel when every man
[1:51:52] into his inheritance to possess the land
[1:51:54] and the people serve the Lord all the
[1:51:56] days of Joshua and all the days of the
[1:51:58] elders that outlived Joshua who had seen
[1:52:00] all the great works of the Lord that he
[1:52:02] did for Israel and Joshua the son of nun
[1:52:05] the servant of the Lord died being 110
[1:52:07] years old they buried him in the border
[1:52:10] of his inheritance in Timnath Harry's in
[1:52:13] the Mount of Ephraim on the north side
[1:52:15] of the hill goash and also all that
[1:52:18] generation were gathered into their
[1:52:19] fathers and there arose another
[1:52:20] generation after them which knew not the
[1:52:23] Lord nor yet The Works which he had done
[1:52:25] for Israel
[1:52:26] the children of Israel did evil in the
[1:52:28] sight of the Lord and served Balaam they
[1:52:31] forsook the Lord God of their fathers
[1:52:32] which brought them out of the land of
[1:52:34] Egypt followed other gods of the Gods of
[1:52:37] the people that were around about them
[1:52:38] and bowed themselves into them and
[1:52:40] provoked the Lord to anger
[1:52:43] we see the we see a generation that came
[1:52:46] out of Egypt and that generation came
[1:52:47] out of Egypt they come to a decision and
[1:52:50] God put the question to them and they
[1:52:52] made their choice they made the decision
[1:52:53] Joshua made it and the elders made it
[1:52:56] but we find now as we move into a second
[1:52:58] generation now coming into the promised
[1:53:00] land now we have as long as Joshua who
[1:53:04] made his commitment was alive they
[1:53:06] served the Lord
[1:53:07] as long as the elders were alive they
[1:53:09] served the Lord but when Joshua and the
[1:53:11] elders begin to get gathered Amen to
[1:53:13] their fathers now all of a sudden There
[1:53:15] Rose up a generation and this generation
[1:53:18] didn't make that commitment
[1:53:21] that was made by their fathers
[1:53:24] and we're we're we're in a situation now
[1:53:27] where the prophet's been off the scene
[1:53:29] for a while and many of us have had the
[1:53:31] privilege of leaving Egypt and making
[1:53:32] our declaration
[1:53:34] many of you and many of me are me
[1:53:37] included we had our opportunity to leave
[1:53:40] Egypt and we come and say no as for me
[1:53:42] and my house I'm going to serve the Lord
[1:53:43] amen but all of us who've made those
[1:53:45] decisions we've had another generation
[1:53:47] come up and I want to speak to you young
[1:53:49] people now don't don't just let your mom
[1:53:52] and dad make a commitment don't let Mom
[1:53:54] and Dad make a declaration don't let Mom
[1:53:56] and Dad decide who they're going to
[1:53:58] serve you've been serving the lord under
[1:54:00] their commitment amen but God is
[1:54:02] gathering home all the elders
[1:54:05] and now I put the question to you today
[1:54:08] amen if you're beyond the age of
[1:54:10] accountability 13 and Beyond who will
[1:54:12] you serve amen will you serve yourself
[1:54:14] your flesh the world or where you serve
[1:54:17] Jesus Christ amen the word that's been
[1:54:19] restored in this day don't just say mom
[1:54:22] and dad and grandma and grandpa the
[1:54:24] church the pastor but now the questions
[1:54:26] coming down personally we all have to
[1:54:28] make a decision and the quicker you're
[1:54:30] able to make the decision the better the
[1:54:32] decisions you're going to make next
[1:54:36] amen don't let it be somebody else's
[1:54:39] don't let it be the church declaration
[1:54:41] don't let it be the elders declaration
[1:54:43] but let it be my personal declaration
[1:54:46] that I say as for me you may not have a
[1:54:49] house yet but as for me and this house I
[1:54:52] live in we will serve the Lord
[1:54:56] amen because when it comes to another
[1:54:58] generation who didn't make that
[1:55:00] declaration it began to mix again
[1:55:04] become right back like the denomination
[1:55:07] to begin to mix again I say this brother
[1:55:10] bear said this bride won't fail she's
[1:55:12] not going back that way there's going to
[1:55:14] come another generation that's going to
[1:55:16] come up and say I not my mom and dad I
[1:55:19] will serve the Lord not just my church I
[1:55:22] if the church fails I've already made my
[1:55:24] commitment and I'm a witness against
[1:55:26] myself today that I choose this message
[1:55:28] in this word
[1:55:32] praise God
[1:55:33] sometimes we just need to make the
[1:55:35] commitment
[1:55:36] quit waiting to see what will happen and
[1:55:38] hope it'll work out and someday no just
[1:55:40] say there's something in me now that
[1:55:42] knows that I've got a privilege to make
[1:55:43] a decision and the question's been put
[1:55:45] before me and I'm going to take my
[1:55:47] opportunity that I have today and say
[1:55:49] ask for me my will my desire is to do
[1:55:52] the will of the Lord my desire is to
[1:55:54] serve him all the days of my life where
[1:55:56] he is I am where he goes I go what he
[1:55:59] says I do amen the way he wants me to
[1:56:01] live I want to live I want to give
[1:56:03] everything else up and stick with this
[1:56:05] word
[1:56:10] amen
[1:56:12] if you don't make the decision life will
[1:56:15] begin to happen
[1:56:17] then you'll make quick decisions and
[1:56:19] those decisions will lead to other
[1:56:20] decisions
[1:56:23] but while we have the opportunity
[1:56:25] say God I'm surrendering my life to you
[1:56:29] what Ruth did to Naomi I'm doing to
[1:56:31] Christ
[1:56:33] I want to give all my life to you
[1:56:37] we've got a
[1:56:39] a privilege
[1:56:40] to exercise free moral agency
[1:56:44] I don't want to be haphazard with it or
[1:56:46] loose or flippant
[1:56:49] but I want to be sincere
[1:56:51] if God's given me the right to make a
[1:56:53] choice
[1:56:54] and I feel in my heart that he's chosen
[1:56:57] me then I'm deciding to follow him with
[1:57:00] all my heart with all my life
[1:57:03] see many of you have made hard choices
[1:57:06] to serve the Lord
[1:57:07] talk got a chance to talk to many of you
[1:57:09] through the years you've made hard
[1:57:11] choices hard separations you've moved
[1:57:14] across the country you've picked up
[1:57:15] families you've left jobs you've had
[1:57:18] lost relationships you've done all kinds
[1:57:20] of things to serve the Lord
[1:57:21] but oh you'll never regret it
[1:57:24] you who've made those decisions and and
[1:57:27] and left places and moved to other
[1:57:29] places and left behind jobs and struck
[1:57:31] out not knowing where you go do you have
[1:57:33] any regrets
[1:57:35] for putting the Lord first
[1:57:37] no I have no regrets amen I mean we've
[1:57:41] given up jobs we've given up businesses
[1:57:43] we've given up friendships we've given
[1:57:45] up familiar areas we've given up so many
[1:57:47] things and I can tell you I have no
[1:57:49] regrets amen the only regret I have is I
[1:57:52] didn't give up earlier and I didn't give
[1:57:53] up more I meant the biggest regret of my
[1:57:55] life is when I come to a junction that I
[1:57:57] took the choice for self that's the
[1:57:59] greatest regret I have but I have no
[1:58:01] regrets for taking God's way
[1:58:04] all of my regrets or decisions I made
[1:58:06] that had self-mixed in
[1:58:11] men
[1:58:13] say God
[1:58:15] and
[1:58:17] I decide you
[1:58:19] this word is true
[1:58:21] I have no other option
[1:58:23] I have no other option
[1:58:25] the message is the truth
[1:58:27] the prophet of God was the voice of
[1:58:29] Malachi 4 the seventh angel and He
[1:58:31] restored the word of God back to the
[1:58:33] bride and it's true and it's been
[1:58:35] Vindicated amen we have the perfect
[1:58:37] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:58:39] Vindication I have no other option but
[1:58:41] to give my life completely to this
[1:58:43] there's no plan B there's no turning
[1:58:46] back it's either all right or all wrong
[1:58:47] I can't mix it with anything else I
[1:58:49] can't mix it with my ideas or even my
[1:58:51] emotional feelings about it I can't do
[1:58:53] any more mixing all I can do is say
[1:58:55] where this word leads I have to go amen
[1:58:57] where this word is I have to stay where
[1:59:00] this word says I have to obey
[1:59:03] I don't have an option
[1:59:08] amen that's the decision we have to make
[1:59:12] amen is not the next wave of doubt the
[1:59:15] next wave of failure the next ministers
[1:59:18] who fall away and churches are split
[1:59:19] you'll see more Spanish
[1:59:23] but oh I don't want to be like that I
[1:59:25] want to be the ones that said I'm
[1:59:26] sticking with this word amen if I wind
[1:59:29] up the only believer in the world
[1:59:30] sitting at home listening to a tape I
[1:59:33] can't leave this word
[1:59:38] amen God help us and we know we have no
[1:59:41] power to keep ourselves we have no power
[1:59:42] to do it ourselves amen but it takes a
[1:59:45] clear brother I said it takes a
[1:59:46] clear-cut decision for Christ
[1:59:50] and that's what I want to give
[1:59:52] when Eliezer when Eliezer came to
[1:59:55] Rebecca's house amen he was led by the
[1:59:57] angel of the Lord he was the servant of
[1:59:59] Abraham to go fetch a son for the for uh
[2:00:02] for fetch a bride for the promised son
[2:00:04] he's doing his commission he's doing his
[2:00:05] work and we know brother Brandon
[2:00:06] fulfilled this amen and he comes to
[2:00:08] Rebecca and supernaturally she Waters
[2:00:11] the camels and all that and he goes back
[2:00:13] to uh her he goes back to the family
[2:00:15] house and he begins to give them gifts
[2:00:17] and he begins to lay out the reason for
[2:00:19] his Aaron
[2:00:21] and he finally says don't delay me he
[2:00:23] wakes up in the morning don't delay me
[2:00:24] let me go
[2:00:25] and they say no stay 10 days Terry a
[2:00:28] little longer we don't want to part with
[2:00:30] our our sister
[2:00:33] he says no don't delay me
[2:00:35] and finally living says let's bring the
[2:00:37] damsel let's ask her amen she can make
[2:00:40] her own decision
[2:00:42] so they brought Rebecca and Rebecca
[2:00:45] Heyman was already moving under that
[2:00:46] anointing because by inspiration she
[2:00:48] watered the camel so she was already in
[2:00:51] the right line of inspiration and now
[2:00:53] they gave her the opportunity to make
[2:00:55] her decision and now eliezer's there her
[2:00:58] family's there everybody's there and the
[2:01:01] question is put to her
[2:01:03] will you go with this man and she says I
[2:01:06] will go amen all right where are you
[2:01:08] going you're leaving your family you're
[2:01:10] leaving your neighborhood you grew up
[2:01:11] you're leaving everything you're going
[2:01:12] with a man you just met yesterday going
[2:01:15] to marry a man you've never met in your
[2:01:17] life amen what are you doing she says I
[2:01:19] will go now
[2:01:22] oh praise God and that decision led to
[2:01:25] other decisions and other decisions and
[2:01:27] finally she became the matriarch in the
[2:01:30] line of Christ she became part of the
[2:01:32] promised word and she became a womb that
[2:01:34] the word was coming through
[2:01:38] oh praise God not say well we'll wait
[2:01:41] and see give me 10 days to think about
[2:01:42] it no this is the truth and I'm giving
[2:01:45] all myself to it right now
[2:01:50] this word is true
[2:01:54] Jesus never forced anybody
[2:01:58] in fact he gave him every opportunity to
[2:02:01] leave
[2:02:04] Moses comes and says choose life or
[2:02:06] death you choose
[2:02:08] Joshua comes and he says choose which
[2:02:10] God Shall Serve
[2:02:13] Jesus comes and says will you go also
[2:02:19] God he's not forcing us you don't have
[2:02:22] to come to church on Sunday
[2:02:25] you don't have to believe the message
[2:02:27] you don't have to line up to the word
[2:02:28] you don't have to surrender your will
[2:02:30] you don't have to
[2:02:33] he's given us the opportunity
[2:02:37] amen and and listen there's enough
[2:02:39] voices out there on the message you can
[2:02:41] find whichever one suits your own
[2:02:42] personal liking
[2:02:45] God's left it all out there why doesn't
[2:02:47] God shut this down why doesn't God shut
[2:02:48] this down in this false hey it's all
[2:02:50] going and it's all prospering
[2:02:54] so if you've got your own personal taste
[2:02:56] and personal desire you can find a you
[2:02:58] can find a flavor of the message to
[2:03:00] match what fulfills your own lusts
[2:03:04] or you can say forget it all I just want
[2:03:06] the word and the word only I just want
[2:03:08] to surrender to the word I'm tired of
[2:03:10] having my own way
[2:03:13] I just want it the way the prophet
[2:03:15] taught it I just want the truth I just
[2:03:17] want the restored word not myself
[2:03:20] anymore but him
[2:03:22] that's what I want
[2:03:24] say God
[2:03:25] granite
[2:03:31] will you go also
[2:03:34] Jesus says
[2:03:36] leave your nets and come follow me then
[2:03:39] he turns and walks away
[2:03:41] he doesn't stand and plead and beg he
[2:03:43] doesn't rationalize he doesn't he
[2:03:45] doesn't start offering Rewards
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:48] now I see Peter you're taking a little
[2:03:50] bit of time to make your decision listen
[2:03:52] what if I throw in eternal life and what
[2:03:54] if I throw in you get to be the big man
[2:03:56] in the church
[2:04:00] no he says come follow me he turns and
[2:04:03] he walks away and now Peter's got to
[2:04:05] make his decision
[2:04:09] Hey listen this message is moving on
[2:04:11] regardless of what you think about it
[2:04:12] it's moving on
[2:04:14] this word's coming to the full
[2:04:16] manifestation of itself
[2:04:18] and it's going to take place in a body
[2:04:20] of Believers on this Earth and it's
[2:04:22] going to move on and it's going to go
[2:04:23] into place and this word is going to
[2:04:24] produce what it's called to produce amen
[2:04:26] it's moving on
[2:04:28] and I want to move with it amen I I want
[2:04:31] to move with it and I want to I want to
[2:04:33] be able to make my claim and my
[2:04:35] statement and said I'm going
[2:04:37] I'll leave all forsake everything and
[2:04:40] I'll go
[2:04:41] and that decision
[2:04:43] that I made years ago has led me to
[2:04:46] another decision
[2:04:47] and led me to another decision to
[2:04:49] another decision
[2:04:51] and it asked me where I am now
[2:04:54] sometimes my wife and I will reflect on
[2:04:57] where our lives would have been
[2:04:59] she was a college student loved college
[2:05:01] she was in her last year's school when
[2:05:03] we heard the message
[2:05:04] when we when we first heard the message
[2:05:07] like she was expecting Blake
[2:05:10] in if we would have went down that road
[2:05:13] she would have worked I would have
[2:05:14] worked we'd had two careers children
[2:05:16] would have been in daycares and
[2:05:17] babysitters we would have went to a
[2:05:19] nominal church we would have we would
[2:05:21] have lived a Halfway Christian Life been
[2:05:23] busy with the world the kids would have
[2:05:24] been in every Sports activity next
[2:05:25] director curricular activity they had
[2:05:27] had friends with all the world where
[2:05:29] would our lives be right now
[2:05:32] if it wasn't for this message
[2:05:37] we have families that are intact we have
[2:05:39] marriages that are prospering we have
[2:05:41] youth that are growing up and becoming
[2:05:43] Godly men and women we have youth that
[2:05:45] can act masculine and act feminine
[2:05:47] they've got young men that can take
[2:05:48] responsibility we've got ladies who are
[2:05:50] sensitive and thoughtful to each other
[2:05:52] to be where does that come from amen
[2:05:54] those were decisions that people had
[2:05:56] made and God Amen brought the word to
[2:05:58] pass in their lives they chose to go the
[2:06:01] word and the word worked and the word
[2:06:03] did all of this
[2:06:06] I don't regret once
[2:06:09] leaving everything for the message
[2:06:11] I don't regret the separations the
[2:06:14] heartaches they hurt I don't regret the
[2:06:16] rejections I don't regret it all because
[2:06:18] it it brought me to a greater life I
[2:06:21] feel like Ruth now amen I feel like I've
[2:06:23] come to a place where I've been restored
[2:06:25] I've been brought into the promise amen
[2:06:27] amen through the womb of my spirit is
[2:06:29] coming forth the the promised sign amen
[2:06:32] what did I do to earn it nothing amen
[2:06:34] what did I do to put myself here nothing
[2:06:35] all there was was something in me that
[2:06:37] said I believe this word is true and
[2:06:39] I'll stick with it amen and it brought
[2:06:41] me to a place that I could never dream
[2:06:43] of being before
[2:06:45] paper
[2:06:46] you've made similar decisions and
[2:06:48] similar results and
[2:06:51] what do we want to do now
[2:06:53] I want to keep going on I want to stick
[2:06:55] with my commitment I'm not changing my
[2:06:57] mind amen I'm not changing my mind when
[2:07:00] I made my the Declaration that I in my
[2:07:03] house we will serve the Lord I'm
[2:07:04] sticking with it still
[2:07:06] because I see what the word has done
[2:07:10] young people this is your hour
[2:07:13] this is your time
[2:07:15] many of us have made our decisions
[2:07:18] many of us have made our declarations
[2:07:22] many of us have had to get shaved down
[2:07:24] and shaved off and cut out
[2:07:30] now it's your turn
[2:07:33] what will you do
[2:07:35] what will you do with this Jesus called
[2:07:38] Christ
[2:07:41] will you wait and see how things go will
[2:07:43] you wait till after you're married will
[2:07:45] you wait till you finish school will you
[2:07:46] wait till you've enjoyed a few Pleasures
[2:07:48] in life
[2:07:50] will you wait till you've experienced a
[2:07:52] little bit of the world
[2:07:54] questions put to you what will you do
[2:07:56] with this Jesus called Christ
[2:08:00] I tell you if you can do what Ruth did
[2:08:02] and you can do what Rebecca did and you
[2:08:04] can do what the disciples did
[2:08:06] then you could spare yourself from a
[2:08:08] whole lot of heartaches
[2:08:11] poor choices and regrets
[2:08:15] I'm not I'm thankful for my life and I'm
[2:08:18] thankful where I'm at and everything's
[2:08:19] worked out perfect I don't want to
[2:08:21] change anything
[2:08:22] but if I could
[2:08:24] sit where you're sitting now and make
[2:08:26] the choice that's offered to you now I
[2:08:29] would do it in a flash of a second
[2:08:31] yeah
[2:08:33] if I could free my mind
[2:08:36] from images of the past it free my mind
[2:08:38] from regrets from the past and I could
[2:08:40] serve the Lord all the days of my life
[2:08:42] if I could change places with you I
[2:08:44] would do it in a fraction of a second
[2:08:49] because this is the only way worth going
[2:08:54] so I encourage you make your choice
[2:08:58] side for the word
[2:09:00] not just young people old people
[2:09:02] sometimes those of us middle age and
[2:09:04] Beyond sometimes we've been hanging
[2:09:06] around with little doubts and little
[2:09:08] questions and not a full commitment and
[2:09:10] waiting to see and feeling things out
[2:09:12] it's time to stop that
[2:09:15] it's time to stop that it's either true
[2:09:17] or it's not true
[2:09:19] it's either the word or it's not the
[2:09:20] word
[2:09:21] it's time to make a commitment make a
[2:09:24] full commitment
[2:09:25] and say I'm sticking with this word I'm
[2:09:29] following Christ with all my heart and
[2:09:32] all my life
[2:09:34] if it costs me my friends it cost me if
[2:09:36] it cost me family it costs me if it cost
[2:09:38] me it cost me
[2:09:40] that's my decision and let's all Stand
