see him amen let's take our bibles and turn to second peter chapter one it's good to be together tonight we praise the lord for these opportunities we don't take them lightly in the environment we live in we don't take them lightly anymore second peter chapter one i'm going to begin reading at verse one second peter chapter 1 verse 1. simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature and having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert you knowledge into knowledge temperance into temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father we thank you that we can gather and sing your praises lord that you put in us a heart of gratitude lord and a faith to believe in you in this day and god with thanksgiving we sing to you songs of worship and praise and now lord as we look with hungry hearts to the word we pray that you would come yourself and break the bread of life to us lord that you would feed us from your own hand lord that you would feed us on your word lord and help us to grow spiritually to be what you want us to be in this world and god we give you preeminence in this place and ask that you take your liberty and may your holy spirit move in the lives and hearts of all your children we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen you can have your seats keep your bibles open here to ii peter we this is a very familiar portion of scripture to us and i just want to look at it for just a minute and then go and look at other things associated with this but we see that we might be partakers of the divine nature from verse 4 here having escaped the corruption is in the world through lust and and beside this give all diligence add to your faith virtue so we know that there's there's going to be these uh seven virtues capped off by the eighth which is charity which is love and god is love so it's capped off by god himself and it's amazing that when we look at these virtues or we look at these attributes or strengths or whatever you can see that the building of these is actually building the character of christ amen the character of christ the character of god himself but in the face of each one of these virtues or each one of these attributes or characteristics you can say each one of these is best expressed in the face of adversity to the virtue so faith is best expressed in an atmosphere of unbelief and so god will always use the contrast amen the contrast to bring out his own nature and that's why the world has fallen in the condition it's in so that we can come into this world in this condition and understand god better because white shows up in the contrast of black i mean once you see the evil experience the evil then the righteousness stands out that much more because you've experienced unrighteousness and so we find out that we find now if as these things are expressed our god is wanting to express these things the greatest way and the best way to highlight the nature of god amen is to bring forth each one of these characteristics and the opposition of the characteristic itself so if we're going to express faith it's going to come in a world of unbelief virtue is when nobody has any more strength amen and when you have no strength in yourself then there's a supernatural strength that takes over amen in knowledge in a time when nobody knows god nobody knows about god nothing of god anymore temperance when the world is full of there's a lack of self-control an absolute utter lack of self-control amen temperance is expressed in patience when there is no more patience and godliness when there is no more godliness amen in brotherly kindness when there is no more brotherly kindness and then the capping off of charity god himself the very nature of god the capstone of love amen when there is no more love in the world and i think we've come to that place i think we've come to the place where the true nature of god amen the divine nature can be expressed like it's never been expressed before and opposition to each one of these is so heightened amen it's so it's so obvious that that the nature of christ stands out like it's never stood out before and so that's what god is calling us to to grow into this expression of christ the very nature the very characteristic of the word can be expressed in these virtues but i want to i want to look at a quote here that we read sunday out of the easter seal is but he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death and alive then when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnestness of you being quickened from mortal to immortal immortality let me say that again when the spirit has found you the individual and has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance that god thought of you and made for you before the foundation of the world that is your potential life you ask me for an oak tree and i give you an acorn now the life for that oak tree is in the acorn now but you have to wait till it grows up further in the same quote he says now notice it's the earnest or the potential the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the holy spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it notice you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection so you're now on your way growing to the full resurrection no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow in grace and knowledge of god you are baptized unto the holy spirit now as the pentecostal church baptized in the holy spirit it's begin growing limbs has died they was pruned them off but the tree is still growing it's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers the word keeps quickening as you come to first limb second limb third limb on up it just keeps quickening the spirit of god keeps quickening to you so now we're growing to the full resurrection but we're growing as the word of god is being quickened to us because the word of god being quickened or made alive is bringing the change amen so now you know we we we come to this uh place where the seed is quickened alive amen it's the potential of the resurrection because we've already resurrected from the dead amen you were you were laying there as if dead amen the potential was laying there unrealized or unquickened or unsparked off but with the contact with god by the baptism holy ghost it sparked that seed off to life amen and now that that life begins to grow to the full resurrection amen and it begins to bring this outside life into obedience to the inside life it begins to bring the outer man subject amen to the inner man that's been quickened to life and he does it as he quickens the word to us so like i was saying it's the reason we go back and read the same book we've read and read the same scriptures we read amen because as we grow he keeps quickening the word and quickening the word and quickening the word and then what and what is it doing it's bringing the potentials out that is already there i put a title on this the full potential is in the seed the full potential is in the seed amen and so many times uh the like i said the denominational idea sometimes is a striving and a climbing and a working our way up into the stature of christ amen to the characteristics of christ and there's so much uh uh if i could say it this way there's so much humanistic labor if i could say that if you understand what i'm saying so much humanistic labor amen to labor to bring forth the characteristics or the nature of christ amen and there's nothing wrong with trying i i hope you don't take me wrong we should be trying we should be trying with all of our heart to live a clean life live a godly life live the way he wants us to live but the reality is humanistic effort will never make it it will never bring forth the full potential of the sea that will never bring us to the full resurrection amen because the humanistic effort the trying harder effort amen is going to create frustration and because there's nothing in the outer man that can accomplish this goal because what what we need is already on the inside it must be quickened by the holy ghost amen as he quickens word upon word upon word amen because the word comes to the word amen and lifts out of the soul the potential that's already there because what's laying in there what is that see gene of god it is a portion of god that god has predestinated to come to life and come to manifestation in this hour that we're living in now so god had foresaw all things and knew amen they knew what bedded what ground you would come to amen where you would be planted in what time you would be planted and so god planted a correct seed for the correct hour in time so so you you're not here wishing oh i wish i would have been alive in luther's day because you didn't have what was what god had planted in you amen was meant for this day to come forth in this hour and everything that is needed was laying in the seed amen it was laying there in seed form or gene form or attribute of god form but it needed something to bring that potential out and that something is the baptism of the holy ghost that comes amen and lights off and and brother baby says when the word lit the soul amen so what is the holy ghost it is the spirit of truth it's what the word says it is the spirit of truth i mean if it's the spirit of truth what is it bringing the spirit of truth is bringing truth and what is truth bringing truth is bringing the spirit of truth you can't separate those two things so now as the word for our age comes and is preached amen it is it is drawing the potential that's in the seed out to the surface that's why we keep laboring in the word that's why we haven't stopped because i don't believe i've come to my full potential yet and i hope you don't believe you've come to your full potential but i believe there's potential for a full manifestation of the full life of jesus christ i believe that with all my heart amen and so that's why we keep laboring in the word amen we keep laying before the lord and saying draw us up draw us up brother baby says in the message things that are to be if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god is not even in you see if you still love the if you still have the love of the world want to act like the world and do like the world yet you're in the church but a cockle burr and a patch with the wheat shout with the rest of them rejoice with the rest of them all the spiritual blessings is right upon you you say well i prophesied so did campuses so did balaam that has nothing i got the baptism the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of god that controls the whole thing to the word of god and the will of god and there you grow up so brother man said the real gift is that soul down in there brother man is not saying that the holy ghost is not the real gift it's a real gift but he's referring to that k ephesus bunch the kf is his bunch who says haven't we done mighty works and aren't i the high priest and haven't we done this and brother bam said that's just a temporal gift for you for you this is the temporal gift amen but the real gift is down in the soul when that baptism the holy ghost strikes that seed in the soul and it connects amen when word comes to word when life comes to life amen and there's a connection and it's sparked off and comes to life that's the real gift is the baptism of the holy ghost on the soul amen so you can have the baptism holy ghost in the spirit but that's not the real gift and brother i'm saying it's not a real holy ghost that's not the real gift the real gift is down in the soul the real gift is your soul down in there see that was born of god and that controls the whole thing to the word of god and the will of god and there you grow up see then you're a son and daughter of god you're a child of god so there you from there you grow up that's what i want to emphasize there you grow up in the message it is the rising of the sun so now now if that spirit that raised up jesus from the grave dwells in you you potentially have life led by the spirit to quicken the word to you to believe it the little thing keeps pushing up as it grows brother keep saying the same thing amen it's quickened the life but it keeps pushing up as it grows it's quicken the life but it's growing it's quick in the life but it's growing to the full resurrection it's quick in the life but it's growing more in the likeness of christ it's bringing this outer man subject to the inner man it's growing within you as he quickens the word to you he says in leadership the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now you're either for god or against god and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside many of you think i got the baptism holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell i would say that would be a temporal gift to you in that condition you can still the baptist only goes every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell the bible says so uh that's exactly right look here you are a outside person you have five senses that contact the outside body god gave you five senses not to contact him your earthly home see see taste uh feel smell in here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and has five outlets conscience and love and so forth five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your but with your spirit your physical contacts the physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that gene that comes from god and like a baby formed in its mother's womb when the baby comes into the mother's womb by the little germ it crawls into the egg it doesn't form one cell a human the next dog the next a cat the next horse it's all human cells because it's building off of an original human cell and when a man has been born again by the word of god predestinated to eternal life called the elected it'll be word of god on top of word word on word not a denominational creed and then a word and a creed and it won't work you can't have that leave it in and only one eternal life jesus christ the word so the true seed amen when sprung to life it'll build word upon word upon word upon word and it won't be mixed with something else you see in order like we said last sunday in order to have a natural birth amen you have to have two of the same kind come together you can't have two of different kinds come together but when two of the same kind comes together you can have a birth amen and so now when we have two of the same kind come together so if the if the word of god is going to come and the spirit of god is going to come to bring a birth then what does it have to make contact with it has to be two of the same kind so there has to be word of god laying down there word has to come to word life has to come there already has to be life down in there it's already got to be there amen it can't get put there it has to be there and something has to come to it and the thing that comes to it has to be the same thing that it is it can't be dog and cat amen it's got to be dog and dog or cat and cat amen in order to bring forth it's got to be god connecting with god oh i hope that doesn't become common to us in a way that we miss the impact of that there has to be a portion of god laying down in there a sieging of god a peace of god has to already be there and it had to be there when you first come into this earth you it had to be there but it had to exist before then because it always existed it's a part of god amen it never uh if i could say this that peace that part that attribute i i don't know if there's an english word that can properly label what it actually is but that's something that come from god amen that did not have a beginning because if it has a beginning then it's not zoe then it's not god but there has to be something there that didn't have a beginning that was a portion of god that god chose to portion out amen so that god can become a family amen and that's what we want to talk about and focus on amen because if if that's a portion of god amen then what kind of potential is laying in that seed i mean sometimes you know as a human being we feel like the world is stacked against us and you know i i'm never going to attain to the level i need to i'm never going to get out of this trial i'll never have financial security and i'll never break forth out of this unhealthiness that i'm in or i never can get free from the bondage i can't break free from my past or out of my complex or i can never get over this hurt i can never get over this disdain in my past i can never get over this dark spot that's humanism but what's on the inside the potential to overcome everything everything that the devil did can be overcome amen by that potential that's laying on the inside amen everything that the devil's ever done all the way back to the original lie he told in the garden of eden can be overcome by that potential that's laying in there because that potential when the word builds on the word builds on the word it can grow to the full resurrection amen when it can grow to the full resurrection it can actually change what had happened all the way back in the garden of eden when hybridization moved in that hybridization can be changed by the potential that's laying on the inside but it's got to be quickened by the word and quickened by the word and quickened by the word and word builds on word builds on word and grows into the full resurrection so we can't keep looking at outside factors if if we could just all dial in we've got to quit looking at outside factors as as impossibilities to overcome and we've got to quit looking at past mistakes and past failures amen as inevitable to repetition that's humanism that's human thinking we've got to stop because what we're doing is we can't see past our human life and we can't see past our human eyes and our human memory and our human reasoning and our human affections it's just the spirit realm and we stay bound down from reaching our full potential and we're bound by the by the spirit realm in our memory reasoning affection consciousness and we remember what it was like every time i i tried this and failed and tried this and found tried this and failed and so we reasoned that i shouldn't try it again and fail because it hurts too bad it's embarrassing i've been wounded i've been hurt i've failed and so now now my memory of what i've done but in the past and the affection the pain that it caused me i'm now using reasoning to try avoid to grow and move forward because of what's happened in the past that's where we all live but if we can quit looking at the man in the mirror if we can quit looking at the hybridization and the outer man and say if if god lives in me if god lives in me what can defeat god what can hold god back what can stop god from overcoming history complexes failures false obstacles that are insurmountable what can stop god the red sea couldn't stop him the overflowing jordan couldn't stop him amen nebuchadnezzar couldn't stop him what could stop him amen amen nothing could stop him thousand thousand demons released out of euphrates can't stop him and then lucifer couldn't stop him in the war in heaven nothing can stop him amen the potential amen is laying within us we just have to feed on the word and let the spirit of god quicken word upon word upon word and poor word and grow into the full potential and quit acting like we're limited amen with humanness we're not limited amen remember we've talked about this before there is no limitation amen when god is present there is no limitation amen peter before he was born again could walk on top of water now you tell me what we're limited to in the human realm philip could disappear and reappear hundreds of miles away why and he was in the same body that we're in in the same condition he'd receive the baptism of the holy ghost yet he hadn't got the full revelation that was laying under the thunders so we have to stop amen letting the news tell us who we are and what our limits are you know we got to stop you there's there's so much there's so much uh confusion in the land in this day so much wickedness on every hand there's so much uh unrest we can't let that affect us you know the there's people rioting in the streets shooting one another burning police precincts there's people getting in fights and arguments over masks there's people throwing fits over wearing it or not wearing it on both sides it's become a political issue and i just want to encourage you don't get caught up in the minutia don't get caught up in the don't take a side on this thing don't take one side or the other don't be republican don't be democrat don't be politically minded whatsoever don't worry about what the government is saying or the government all they're doing is setting up for the next phase of destruction we know it's all lost it's all ruined there's no hope it's never turning around it's never coming back these things has to be this way and everything that's setting up getting worse is getting worse because it's supposed to get worse and it's getting worse for what comes next but that's not who we are you we may be affected by that in the flesh we may we may be restricted in some ways and affected in some ways but don't get caught up in none of that stuff let's look a little higher and say this my deliverance is coming nigh amen day by day word by word this thing doesn't affect me it only affects my flesh but it doesn't affect me don't get caught up because all of a sudden what happens we get so troubled in our spirit amen that we're not even living to the potential god wants us to live amen because there's something deeper than the spirit realm that he wants to take control of the outside man and our minds are so caught up by news and and all this you know what happened with the economy what will happen with their jobs what will happen all that take no thought what you'll wear for tomorrow oh that's a fun quote that's a fun scripture to put on your mirror that's a fun scripture to put in your car but it's not a fun scripture to live right some of these things that we've talked about are nice to talk about they're pep rally kind of verses take no thought tomorrow consider the lily amen solomon in all's glory wasn't dressed like one of them you know take no thought what you eat or what you aware your father knows those are great pep rally scriptures but when it comes down to it you actually have to live it where the rubber meets the road and you actually have to forget about it and trust god to provide for tomorrow's meet for tomorrow's raymond for tomorrow's job for tomorrow's whatever when we actually get there you're going to be at war with the outer man and you're gonna have to subdue the outer man and pull him back amen so that you can continue living the life that god's called us to live it'll be absolute spiritual warfare for that pep rally scripture to come to manifestation right we learned them in sunday school we quote them to one another anytime somebody goes through a trial we start quoting them to them and they're every bit the truth but the reality is when we get to that point it's going to be a fight to subdue the outer man to let the inner man live but i'll tell you if we can if we can die to this outer man and die to reasoning and die to conscience and die to natural affections amen we can see god do supernatural things we believe that we're the elect of god the seed of god the bride of jesus christ we do but it's so easy for spiritual indonesia in the midst of a trial to creep back in and forget who we are and let panic come in and anxiety come in and panic and anxiety will start to dominate again and that's a battle we have to fight that's not something that we should say should never happen it'll happen you still live in hybrid flesh you still have a human spirit you will still have to fight your way through those things it's not a cakewalk it's not easy it wasn't meant to be easy it was supposed to be hard so we have to focus on what we know what the reality of what this is see we've had it good we've had it good we may have had it better naturally speaking then we're ever going to have it again maybe i don't know it could get a lot better it could get a lot worse but i think we can all come to the place where we can agree there's some uncertainty we may and america have already seen our best days we may not we may see better yet i don't know but all i know is that can't move me anymore that can't move me anymore the word has to be the thing that moves me the word has to be the thing that directs me and moves me and guides my feet i've got to keep putting focus on the thing that will really matter when it really comes to the rub what will really matter this word that i've held in my heart a new body will materialize around that i've got we got to get down to the we got to get down to the real reality and focus on that and we've got to be singularly focused on that because there's going to be way more distractions than there are now i mean as we get nearer and nearer and and the distractions are going to get uh more difficult maybe more violent maybe more more frightening and more desperate amen but it doesn't change anything in the word of god in the plan of god we got to go back we got to go back and rehearse basics and never forget that i am a seed gene of god predestinated by god to be expressed in this day that i'm living and if the day i'm living is destined to fall completely apart then the potential in me to to crest every wave is already here when i was talking to some brothers at the picnic table on on sunday at the reception we were talking about that and i was i was mentioning brother branham says the stabilizers have been put on the ship and shall crest every wave you know when you first hear that you're like yeah the stabilizers have been put on the ship she'll crest every wave do you realize what that means that means there's going to be waves like there's never been waves before there's something was coming to the church brother bedam knew that was going to require stabilizers that hadn't been put on the ship yet because the ship's going to see waves like it hasn't seen yet so the stabilizers were needed amen so you know if god wakes you up in the night and you have an angelic visitation he says i just want you to know that i've put extra stabilizers on your ship i'm just letting you know i've just finished putting extra stabilizer on your ship don't worry you'll crest every wave oh you may feel good for a few minutes but when the reality kicks in and the waves start coming and they get bigger and bigger amen and they start curling up over the ship and crashing down on top and you start bobbing in the water up and down you're going to have to remember the stabilizers are already on the ship she'll crest every wave and then at that time it's going to become a reliving reality not a pep rally quote not something that we're excited about but something when we start living it out it's going to be the very anchor that holds us through the waves it's going to be the very reality that keeps us going when nothing else will keep us going so all these so much of my life scripture has been uh scripture has been something that comes on cards of encouragement or a nice little phrase or a cute flowery picture of meadow with a scripture because it's beautiful but the reality of living the scripture isn't the flowery meadow the reality of living out and fleshing out the scripture is in the backdrop of black when jesus came to live the scriptures what was his experience when paul began to live the scriptures what was paul's experience when noah lived the scriptures what was his experience when abraham lived out the scriptures what was his experience do i have to go through every character in the bible find one find one that was skipping through the meadow picking flowers smelling them reciting bible verses they were living the scriptures they were living out the prophecies amen and the word was coming in the face in the opposition of that word it was coming to conquer in the opposition of that prophecy i think we need to remember these things and be reminded of them and when things get tough say praise god if god allows this then there's something in me he wants to express that will overcome this because it's already there it just has to be unlocked it's already in there but the bible says in the message show us the father from 1955. now you people here you have beautiful trees perhaps have great apples plums now look a little tree just about one inch high has everything in it all the peaches all the apples all that'll ever be in it was in it when it was just one inch high if it isn't then where does it come from now you plant that little tree as a seed and it drinks it drinks it drinks it drinks it has to drink more than its portion and as it begins to drink it pushes out limbs pushes out blossoms pushes out apples the only thing the tree does is drink and it pushes out that's the way it is with every man or woman that's born of the spirit of god you are planted in christ jesus and the only thing you have to do is to drink from his promise it'll push out divine healing everything you have need of it'll push out as long as you are planted in christ jesus everything everything brother man i said you take an apple seed every apple that'll ever be produced off that tree is in the seed right then but it's got to go in the ground in the right condition and grow and the water and the sun has to come and it grows and produces all the apples but every apple it ever produces in the seed right then let's turn to ephesians real quick ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so who decided what good works you would do on this earth and when was it decided so if that's the case god had to put that in the seed because every apple ever come forth was in the seed and if god has already ordained the good works that we should walk in that we should perform it was already ordained then god had to put it in the seed so what do i do amen feed on the word drink up the rain drink it up and push out feed it up and push out amen we've got to quit wandering to and fro over the face of the earth trying to solve all of our problems our problems are solved by the quickening power of the word for this day because the word and the spirit go together it is the spirit of truth when truth comes the spirit of truth comes when the word comes the spirit of the word comes amen the word for this day amen will quicken the potentials that's laying in the seed for this day we've got to keep feeding on the word and asking god to lift us higher give us eyes to see amen because so many things are accomplished by revelation remember when when elisha was in daythan in gehesa his servant was with him and and the army of syria coming and camped around about him amen uh geheza woke up and he was nervous because of what his eyes saw he was nervous he was frustrated he assumed that death or capture was was imminent but elisha was just as calm and as cool as he could be why it was a difference of revelation it wasn't a difference of physical eyesight the difference was revelation elisha knew who he was he knew who god was he knew what his purpose was he knew there was nothing to worry about god had it all under control and because he had a he there was a spiritual reality to elijah that was greater than the natural reality when the natural reality looked bad elisha was elisha was still fine amen but geheza who was stuck in a carnal mind amen he was nervous so elisha prayed god opened the eyes of this young man and all of a sudden he opened his spiritual eyes and he could see chariots of fire and angels all around the hills all around them and now by spiritual revelation gehesa relaxes see what did it take it took a spiritual revelation amen that he would elisha could say relax relax relax relax relax it's okay relax amen he would just get more and more worked up amen because it's almost like elijah's in denial everything's fine yeah it's fine but i love it when you talk to somebody like that amen you've got a trial you're going through a hard time amen things are bad and your friend come to you and he says oh you've got this and this and this i'm praying for you have you tried this have you tried that have you tried here you say no i'm trusting god i've got a revelation in my heart everything's fine it's fine but yeah i know that's the word but i love when somebody says yeah i know the scripture but it's like thanks buddy i know that but and they think it'd be or get hazardous i know elisha but i know god i know he stood up for you time and time again i know you're a prophet of god i know you're here by the will of god i know you're serving god's purpose but look at the syrians i know god stood up for you time and time again but look at the series i know you stood for him on stanford but look at the sirians and god said allah said god open his eyes so that he can see a greater spiritual reality why why do you think it's so important that we preach bright age and bride coming and the coming of the lord and the sea gene of god why do you think it's so important we preach that amen because that gives you the spiritual eyes to overcome the situation you have to know who you are what day you're in what his purpose for you is you have to know amen because if we don't know these things amen we're still trying to overcome laodicea with a layout to see in mind and the only way to overcome the laodicean condition amen is to fly a little higher amen and god give us spiritual revelation of what we've been caught up into and what his purpose is for the bride in this age and when we preach these realities of the word for our day amen it brings a different vision to our eyes amen the revelation of who we actually really are begins to take the scales off of our eyes so that when we see these things in the natural we can relax because we have a greater vision in the supernatural how is he going to let how is he going to lose his bride how is there going to be one thing that happens to his bride that surprises him i'm the bride of jesus christ and what are you so nervous about because your nervousness and your confession with your mouth don't they don't match your constant anxiety and fear with the confession of who you say you are they're not lining up they're not going together because if we really once we really catch this revelation amen then there's got to come a rest to the soul and that rest in the soul has got to fight this anxiety in the outer man and bring it subject to the word amen just imagine for yourself that your soul is elisha and your outer man is ghaza say god god help me with this outside guy he's a nervous wreck he's worried about his job he's worried about his mortgage payment he's worried about this oh god help me rein in this this servant does nathan instead of going the other way we've got to quit letting nathan give the reality to elisha but elisha speak the reality to dathan relax my friend all is well and your mind is twisted in knots but you're saying relax all as well your emotions are scrambled up and running rampant and in your heart you're trying to say all is well it's a battle we have to fight friends brother brahm says in the patmos vision i just want to take a few minutes and i'm going to go really slow i think but i want to catch this out of the scriptures in the patmos vision he says cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like like in the garden of eden i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent brother ben said i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is hallelujah amen even when you say it your brain your outside man and all its funny feelings and but down inside it's absolutely the truth because it's god in here amen it's god inside this flesh it's god tavern now deity tabernacled in the clay amen it's limitless i mean it's got full potential nothing can stop it there's omnipotence inside of a man man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 12 whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with the creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that has promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met what to omnipotence the omnipotent outside you and the omnipotent inside you has met quickened the revelation and it spoke through human lips and when it spoke through human lips amen it's the same as deity speaking not when it comes from here when it comes from here it's wishful thinking that's not the same as deity speaking even if it comes from here is a mental acknowledgement of the word or the message and it comes from here and comes out here it's not guaranteed that that will move i hope you understand what i'm saying that's just a mental process amen and there's nothing wrong with confessing the word through a mental process amen but that mental process has got to drop down and strike the soul until a living reality out of the soul comes and when that happens and the mouth speaks it absolutely will happen because that is deity speaking because it's not the mind of man it's not the will of man amen it's not the function of a man amen it's the function of god using a man moses without the baptism of the holy ghost could could create flies and fleas and all of these other things what can happen today if somebody gets fully surrendered to god the potential is there friends brother brahman said in 1960 when he said the expression made i jotted it down on a piece of paper i'll pick it out in the office there two omnipotents meet that's true when god and a believer meets there's two omnipotents because a man is a part of god he is a son of god he goes on to say in the restoration of the bride tree from 1962 otherwise you're going to form what's known to me as a bride see all right i'll go with you you will be part of me you will be my bride my life will be in your body just like a husband and wife as one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me and i and you and you and me oh i just love that satan just gets so angry at that see the oneness of god that's a big statement friends don't let it fly over the head he said just like husband and wife is one person bride and bridegroom one person you and i are going to be one at that day you'll know that i am in the father the father and me i and you and you and me oh i just love that satan just gets so angry at that the oneness of god the oneness of god brother branham didn't limit to father son and holy ghost the oneness of god the definition brother brahm gives you the oneness of god the example he says is i am the father the father and me i in you and you and me that makes you that attribute inside of you part of the oneness of god and that's the revelation that satan is fighting in this hour the revelation to the individual one person coming to you recognizing who you really are you're not you're not the flesh that you were born into you're not just coming through these two parents you know not that that's not who you really are what you really are from the mind of god before the foundation of the world is that attribute that's laying down inside the soul that's what satan doesn't want to be expressed and that's the revelation that he's fighting and he's still fighting it let's take our bibles and turn to john 14. i want to take several scriptures here in just a bible study and go through it slow now as we go through this i just want you to hang on with me and and i want you to think um just keep your mind alert and put your spiritual jacket on as we read this and we all know this we've all read it but it's just so much fun to read it because you're going to find out that jesus begins to speak illogically to the human mind i'm not saying he's illogical he's illogical to the human mind he starts to say things that don't add up but it's the scripture and it's what jesus told his disciples and you'll never get them to add up without a revelation of the godhead without a revelation of the oneness of god you'll never get this picture painted right but let's just look at these scriptures let's go to john i'm in luke john chapter 14 verse 7. if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip saith unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me philip he that hath seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake we we know this scripture so well that we can take a surface reading and we can always miss what else is laying there but he says when you see me you have seen the father but the scripture says no man has seen the father jesus says no man has seen the father at any time but when you see me you see the father you know i god the father only took one body of flesh to dwell in fullness and that was his son jesus christ but there's another meaning here too because it's not just c with the natural eyes because pharisees saw him sadducees saw him and rejected him and didn't see the father but he's bringing a greater revelation if you actually see me if you see who i am by revelation know who i am you see the father it's not just a physical seeing only amen it's a spiritual scene and we'll show that a little bit later he says but you know let's read it again if you had known me you should have known my father also well you know they knew some people knew jesus some people grew up in the same town with him they knew what family he was from and they probably knew what his favorite food was but that's not the knowing he's talking about he's talking about if you know me an intimate knowing if you know me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him philip asked the question and he says i've been so long time with you he has thou not known me philip he that has seen me had seen the father and how thou sayest show us the father i can't show you i've shown you i can't show you because i've already shown you how did he show you in the works it was the father working in me it was him and me and i and him and believe me if you can't believe me believe me for the work's sake i've already shown you the father how did he show you the father not just in the skin he showed him the father because it was the father behind the skin doing the works praise god let's go over to verse 16. and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you all right here's some more confusing language because if you're looking at this carnally there's nothing he's saying makes sense it only makes sense if you understand the godhead and says spiritual revelation even the spirit of the truth who the world cannot receive because it seeth him not when do you ever see the holy ghost he's talking about the spirit of coming the spirit coming they don't see him amen but you're going to see him you're going to know him amen in fact he's dwelling with you now and jesus says i've got to go so he can come when i go the father will send him but he's dwelling with you now you understand the revelation transcends language language cannot encapsulate the revelation but that jesus is just using words to try to get them to understand there's a transition coming but the words he's saying don't even make sense there's a spirit coming that they can't see well nobody can see a spirit with these eyes remember these disciples are going to be able to see and i'll tell you further you know him and he's dwelling with you but i thought you said you would send him how do i know him if i haven't met him yet how do i know him if you haven't seen him yet amen now you know why sometimes you can't figure out the language in the message the same exact reason even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you so who's coming the comforter or you and he's dwelling with us and he will be in me you understand if we could go back and erase everything we know and stand there where the disciples are standing there can you imagine the look on their faces they're trying to catch what he's saying i'm going to go and send you another comforter they're comforted by the presence of jesus christ he's right there in their midst and a flesh body they're comforted by that and but he says he says but i'm going to go and the father i pray the father he will send you another comforter can you imagine calculating you go talk to father father is going to send comforter comfort is going to come down and nobody will see him the world can't see him but you'll know him because he's dwelling with you now the spiritual reality is greater than the natural understanding i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that love with me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him manifest just means reveal or show judah saith in him not ascaria lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him man i'm going to get the father and jesus christ and the comforter that's the truth amen but it's not going to be what a carnal mind thinks there's not three it's all the same exact thing amen it's all god god and whatever manifestation god wants to manifest himself that's why the human language cannot encapsulate or explain what's going to happen if you were a disciple that day i imagine it was very confusing brother brahman says in christ is the mystery god revealed jesus said at that day that's this day he brings him to this scripture but brother branham takes this scripture and brings it back to this day he said at that day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known what revelation the revelation is christ the mystery of god revealed amen and christ in you the hope of glory when this revelation is revealed you will know that i am in the father and the father in me i in you and you and me when the revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that i and the father are one i am in the father and the father is in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's i in you and you and me there you are what is that the oneness of god and who's included in the oneness of god i'm included in the oneness of god that's why the carnal mind will never understand that because you know something besides me has to come to me and when something besides me comes to me it can quicken something that's down inside of me just leave all the human stuff out of it amen there's a part of god laying down inside the soul and god is going to come to god to quicken it the life amen and nurture this thing as it grows and grows to what to the likeness of god to the manifestation of the word whatever term you want to use leave the flesh out of it and quit making it three or four or five different people amen that's why the bride of christ is one body many members one make that make sense it's not carnally comprehended it's spiritually understood it's all the oneness of god let's go to verse 26 14 26. but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've said unto you now let's go over to chapter 15 verse 26 but when the comforters come who i will send unto you let's go back to 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send 15 26 but when the comforters come whom i will send who sends the comforter is it the father or is it the son who sends the comforter it's the same one amen praise be to god if not you have to have two comforters because you have two different people sending two different comforters and now you got to decide which comforter you want it has nothing to do with the language forget the language catch what he's saying amen he and the father are one and then i in you and you and me we're one and then the father and i will make her a boat in you to be what to be one so it's all one thing praise god chapter 16 verse 7 nevertheless i tell you the truth is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you i thought that was the father's job amen oh i love this this is all in here for a purpose and for a reason it's said both ways for a reason so that we can take and take it both ways slap an equal sign between the middle and say it's the same thing because if the father is going to send you the comforter and i'm going to send you the comforter then then then the father and the son are one amen 16 27. for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and i believe that i come out from god see why did the father love them not because they believed just his earthly manifestation in the healings and the miracles the father loved them because you have loved me and have believed that i come out from god that's why the father loved you because you believed i was originally in god this is important friends because this is how we're supposed to love one another and this is what we're supposed to recognize about one another because we love one another because we recognize that we came out from god verse 28 and i came forth from the father and him come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father so verse 28 is an important one i come forth from the father and him come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father let's go to chapter 17 verse 14. i have given them my word and i and the world has hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world how was he not of the world go back to previous chapter verse 28 i come forth from the father and i'm coming to the world again i leave the world and i go back to the father that's how jesus was not of the world he came from the father and he went back to the father and now he points to disciples and he says i've given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world the same way he was not of the world is the same way we're not of the world and we're not of the world because his origin was in god not as beginning his origin was in god not my beginning but my origin was in god i've come out from god into the world but someday i'm going back to god jesus came out from the father and he knew he was going back to the father and this is why god loved him because they caught that revelation let's look at verse 20 now 17-20 neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me if we catch the reality of this what does it matter if the plant's closing down what does it matter if the government fails and what does it matter if currency is worth nothing tomorrow morning do you understand what i'm saying if if you if something in you that part of god that's in you that was to be you before the foundation of the world if that came out of god amen is destined to connect back to god and god put it here for a purpose in this tabernacle of flesh to express his word for this day what does it matter if the banks fail what does it matter if the jobs are gone what is it yes there'll be stress yes there'll be tension yes there'll be hardship but but if if god allows it to happen there's a purpose for it to happen and something he wants to accomplish and he's already pre-wired us to meet the condition of the age there's already something there there's already something in his word it's already been unrocked by the message there's something that god wants to do amen and if he chose to do it that way it's the only way he can accomplish it do you realize that his eye is on you why is his eye on you his eye was on abraham no matter where abraham moved amen god was watching wherever abraham moved why because abraham was a predestinated seed god was not losing amen he was not losing contact with abraham he was not losing abraham and the crowd of people god has not lost you in the crowd he has not lost you in the many numbers of 7.7 billion people on the planet he hasn't lost you he knows where you're at and he's predestinated you and your life and your steps and he'll not let anything happen that he has not ordained and so if god allows circumstances to come he wants to bring a result and he wants to manifest something and this is the only way it'll work because if it'll work another way he'd have allowed another way you know how much time i've wasted complaining about my circumstances you know how much time i've spent grumbling and complaining when god is wanting to move when god is wanting to show himself mighty on my behalf when god is wanting to confirm his word how many marvelous testimonies have we heard of divine healing how much stress fear and pressure have the individuals had to go through to get to the testimony of divine healing you realize it wasn't easy it wasn't easy we love the testimony and we shout and rejoice in the testimony and that's what god wanted to do to show his word is the same yesterday today and forever to show he's here to show that he can still heal but in order to show that he's got to take us into a condition into a place that none of us want to go and he's got to put us in places that that our flesh doesn't want to be and under circumstances that we would love to get out of because he's trying to manifest himself he did it in every church age he did it in all the believers through the bible what makes you think he's not going to do it in you and i so we have to start recognizing in every trial and every hardship and then we have to recognize god is trying to do something i need to get in tune with what he's doing i need to get in the program i need to get in the channel i don't want to fight i don't want to wrestle i don't want to be nervous i want to sit back and relax and say god what do you want me to do how do you want me to react brother i said many times god will do something just to see how you react to it he'll allow somebody to say something he'll allow something to be done that was wrong somebody say something just to see how you react why because he's got character that he wants on display he wants all of these things in the face of opposition and the opposition of virtue and the opposition to temperance and the opposition the brotherly love and the opposition to charity he wants in the face of the opposition to demonstrate his charity his temperance his brotherly kindness he'll say why would he do that because he's god and he wants to prove he's god do you believe god wants to prove he's god then you tell me how is he going to prove he's god he's going to have to take wherever he is and where is god and display it through that when elisha was here was in elisha abraham was here as an abraham noah was here as in noah but who's here now who's here now and where is he working now and if he's going to display himself now where is he going to display himself if he's going to show himself a healer if he's going to show himself a deliverer if he's going to show his characteristics in his character if he's going to show divine love where is he going to show it he's going to show it here and if there's going to be a need for divine love it's got to be in a face of lack of love we might as well get comfortable with that thought amen brethren said in the message convinced and then concerned said therefore jesus said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works that's right he could speak and say the words and what it was it isn't me it's my father that dwelleth in me see and his father that's the reason he prayed to the father someone asked me he said well then how could you pray to the father if the if the father was in them i said how do you pray to the father the fathers in you that's a good question see there you are you pray to the holy ghost so you sure do god was in christ reconciling the world to himself great jehovah god dwelt in christ we it is in us by measure he goes in 1963 calling jesus on the scene someone asked me then how do how did he pray in the to who did he pray to in the garden of gethsemane i said i'll answer you that when you answer me this do you believe you have the holy ghost yes i said then who do you pray to where is he at when you pray to him when you claim you have him and yet you're praying to him i in you you and me in that you'll know you'll know i am in the father the fathers and me i and you and you and me jesus those disciples in that day if you keep my commandments the father will love you and the father and i we will come to you and make our abode with you where's the father and the son in the disciples where's the father that they pray to what did the scripture say in that day you'll know i and you you and me see in human terms we only understand by time and space nothing makes sense to us unless we can put it in a physical place in time we say right here i'll set i'll set one thing object here and i'll go all the way over here and i'll set another object over here and in our dimension that we live in our carnal understanding we'll say that is here and this is there but god can say that and this are the same thing and they're in the same place don't try to figure it out you'll fizzle some brain cells but god transcends space god transcends time god created time created space to manifest himself amen he is not bound by space and time amen jesus when he was talking to nicodemus he was saying the son of man who's here which is in heaven the son of man was in heaven and here and you're seated now in heavenly places in christ jesus but you're right here you can be in two places at once because there's not really two places at once and we can't understand that but we try to take god amen we try to make the father over here and the son over on i mean the sons on this altar here the father standing over here the holy ghost is working all over the place you understand we limit our understanding of god amen god's in you if you're a child of god born again god is dwelling in you and the same god dwelling in you is the same god dwelling in me amen and we are one right that's what jesus said his prayer was that they would be one even as you and i are one in the same way that the father and the son is one is the same way that he wants me and you to be one amen explain it brother chad i'm done that's as far as i can go i can't explain it but it's a reality it's just as real as those angels that we're encompassing around the syrian army it's just as real amen that god is linked to every one of us at the same time this was one body of jesus christ on the earth amen and christ is dwelling in that body on the earth how does it work i don't know but the fact is it's nothing but the truth amen and if that is the truth then there's nothing for me to fear there's nothing for me to worry about there's no reason to let anxiety take over me because god has got it all under control because he's here and he's here and he's here and he's there and he knows the future and he knows the past and he's been in it all and it was done before the foundation of the world and now he's letting it manifest in this little hickey called time but he's not even in this hickey called time he's still in eternity watching what's going on in the hickey called time and he's orchestrating it all and has it all pre-planned and how does it all work i don't know but i know one thing that he's got it all under control i know for sure that nothing is going to happen to me unless it's ordained to happen and if he allows it to happen it's the very thing that needs to happen to get me where he wants to be to do what he wants to do rest little bride rest all as well rest why why does it have to be this way i don't know but it has to be this way i'm just going to read two scriptures second corinthians 5 19 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself colossians 1 26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to the saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory that's why brother baby says all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church and he's not going to lose you and he's very aware of what's happening i want to read a quote as we close out of the message i know this is one of my favorite portions of the message remember them says in chapter or in paragraph 28 of i know from 1960. it is written in one of the scriptures in the bible trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself that's first peter 1 and 6. wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold that's many temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found the praise and the honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ back to the quote brother brahm says they're more precious to us than gold itself for it is god giving us these trials after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life after him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory it is to bring us to a place where god can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come i want to join in this morning with job to say that i've lived long enough to know that that's the truth i've seen in my own life that every time a great situation rises that i can't get around it or under it or over it god makes a way and comes out glorious i just wonder how his grace ever does it but he does it and remember in all these things satan tries to make us nervous and upset key in on this listen and all these things satan tries to make us nervous and upset us to get us to think oh why did this happen why couldn't it have been like this has that ever happened to you have you ever asked yourself that question if you haven't asked yourself that question in a week's time i wonder where you're living but that's satan trying to make us nervous and upset us why did it happen like this why couldn't it have been like this further down in paragraph 36 he says it's those crucial hours that press us on those sacred sands it was in the bible and remember no matter how great the distress is satan cannot take your life until god has finished with you there is nothing can happen to you unless god permits it there is no evil can come unless god permits it and it's for your good he's working that can we believe that can we just take it and believe it and accept it amen and realize that that there's tribulations that are ordained for us to overcome the stabilizers have been put on the ship why were the stabilizers put on the ship because the ship is going to need the stabilizers that means the water's going to get rough amen now maybe we'll go from shouting at that quote to going oh the stabilizers are on the ship oh he just put the stabilizer oh he just put the big stabilizers on the ship it's for your good he's working that let's think there when the floods come to destroy the earth it could not destroy noah noah could not be destroyed because that god had worked for him to do one day down in a great nation under a great bondage there were some hebrew children that we know as shadrach meshach and abednego and it come to a place where they had to make a decision that something had to be done their faith was put to the test and when their faith is put to the test then don't fail stay right with what you believe oh that's so crucial friends if you've confessed to believe something you say i believe that this is of god and i believe that god led me here and i believe this is of god don't change your mind when things start going backwards because if you start doing that amen you're never going to be able to trust the leading of the lord ever again because if you feel that this is of the lord stick with it amen if you feel god let your stick with it because every opposition will come just stick with it and let god direct your path let god leave let god turn don't start making your own decision just wait till god leads step by step by step and you'll find out you'll come right through the trial because it's ordained but we too many times we run from one opinion to another opinion we go from yeah this is of the lord no no i was wrong now this is of the lord no no i was wrong no this is of the lord amen once you believe something you stick with it amen and once we believe something in the word we stick with it amen and watch it work friends watch it work every time too many times we start to question and start to second guess when everything starts to go wrong amen it's going to go wrong everything's going to go wrong if you've lived long enough you know everything's going to go wrong but if you believe something stick with it and watch god work everything out praise god stay right with what you believe those three hebrew children they didn't know what god would do but they knew one thing they were going to compromise on the word and bow down to that image and they knew god could save him but they didn't know that he would but they stayed with it anyways he said now and when they faced when they faced faith was put to a test and they went through a crucial hour not only did they go to ashley but they went to a fiery furnace but satan could not destroy them for god's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in there with this hope i know my redeemer liveth they could go in there with this hope there we are assured that god is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace but nevertheless we will not bow to the image satan could not take them he could not drown no in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from their consolation and i'd like to say it this way if the purpose in this life is finished why would we want to stay one second longer the sixth dimension is beautiful brother branham went amen hope when she crossed over she had babies she had two babies a young mother young newly married with two babies when she crossed to the other side when bill when brother brown called her back she said why did you call me back and then i want to go she didn't want to come back to this side with two babies and a young husband you think that would have been the best that would have been the greatest love ever but she had entered into perfect love which was greater than mother's love greater than a love of an infant baby that she could snuggle with perfect love was greater than mother's love greater than baby's love brother branham when he went across he could look back and he could see his wife laying there he could see himself lying there and when they he felt that funny feeling and he said i don't have to go back do i i don't have to go back he could look back shouldn't he be shouldn't he be a good husband and want to go back where his wife is see he had entered in perfect love and there was not enough human language to explain what it was like i say friends if if god's purpose is done in our life why do we want to stay if god's purpose is not done in our life then we can't go no so what are we worried about so we're really the reality and the truth really hits home what are we worried about we can't go before our time if it's our time we don't want to stay believers don't fear death death is a release for us desert is a release to a far better place it's not a fearful thing for us it's a blessing it's a reward it's a beautiful transition amen brother brahma says and why does god let troubles come it's a good question and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and that little ark pitching up and down in the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the covenant of hope the covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i've liked that poem or psalm must i be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas we ask for comfort and peace god gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comforts is just beyond the river it wasn't until the hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the son of god standing among them their troubles produced the son of god standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave but not until they went to the fire did that comforter appear i wonder if they regret that i wonder if they regret seeing the comforter seeing one like the son of god come and rescue them i wonder if they regretted their stand if they regretted the anxiety if they regretted the stress if they regretted the fear walking up to be thrown into fire or were they glad that they took their stand or were they happy that they endured to the end i don't think we're ever going to regret having faith in standing on faith i don't think we'll ever regret whatever trials come whatever troubles come but if we just take our stand and stand on faith i don't think we'll ever regret it it see that was daniel who had purposed in his heart that he not defiled himself with the things of the world and was forced through a trial whether he'd pray to god or go to a lion's den but it was after the heat was put on he was thrown into a lion's den then that after that he saw the angel of the lord standing in the midst of him keeping away the great pillar of fire standing between him and the lions and the lions could not get him because he'd went through the trials and temptations and troubles he knew that his god was able to deliver him from that it was abraham after he'd seen the ground get barren and the drought come and lot separate himself and go down to live deliciously into the world it was after he had heard the wines and cries of his herdsmen with no grass for his cattle but he maintained in the land that god gave him and told him to sow jordan in and as as on that day after he had been tried till his patience was at the end it was on that day that when after the trial was over he spoke face to face with elohim under the oak that day it was after he'd suffered his trials after he went through the troubles that he'd been through that god appeared to him in the form of a man and sat there and told him he was married in his wife's name of sarah and said she laughed at him in the tent behind it was there that abraham called him elohim it was after the trial and tribulation what did the trial and tribulation produce a greater revelation of him what does the trial and tribulation produce for us friends a greater revelation of him some of us have been through some hard things but i'd venture to say there's harder things coming yet but what does it produce a greater revelation of him a greater it was after the trial that they saw the promise it was after they made their stand that they saw one like the son of man it was after abraham had made his choice and was suffering for it when lot was living the lips it was after that that he met god face to face and i said god don't let me try to avoid what you're trying to bring from my good don't me try to circumvent what you're trying to do to bring a greater revelation of yourself to me but help me have faith that you who allowed this it's for a purpose you who brought me down this road it's for a reason it wasn't in vain it wasn't aimless it wasn't for no reason and it wasn't so that the devil could have his way from with me it was so that you could reveal yourself to me and through me god now wants to manifest manifest himself where in me do you believe that does god want to manifest himself in you how is he going to manifest himself in you it'll be in the face of everything that's contrary to that life everything that's contrary to that nature to those characteristics that's how he's always manifested himself in the bible and that's how he wants to manifest himself in you don't be afraid of what comes next let's all stand musicians come don't be afraid sometimes i wonder if we're not so worried that we're going to have a trial that we create undue anxiety about this could go wrong or that could go wrong or we might have this i wonder what that looks like to god when he tells us in his word and his message who we are and his plans that he has for us and the works that he's ordained for us i wonder if we couldn't just adjust our vision just a little bit and just adjust our mindset a little bit and say if this is what god wants this is what i want if this is what if the three hebrew children only could read the bible we read it would have relieved a lot of stress if they could have only read the story after the fact they would have been totally different i mean if abraham could have read what we read i mean those 25 years of waiting and all the contention with lot that have been no big deal but that's not how god does it but he put all of those stories there for us he put all of those examples there for us and put the life of the prophet on display for us so that we could say god you know the way that i take you know the path that you want from me if this is what you want this is what i want if this is the way you want to reveal yourself to me then i say blessed be the name of the lord if this is how you want to get glory to your name then i say blessed be the name of the lord let me not amen change my confession let me not back down that i know i'm a child of god i know god knows the way i take and i know god has a purpose in this i don't think i don't think things are going to get easier and easier and easier i think things are going to continue to be difficult they've been difficult all our lives why should we expect anything different they've been difficult through the whole walk why should we expect it different it's been difficult through the whole bible why should we expect anything different i say let's come to terms with it now god has already ordained things to happen god has already already placed the seed within and inside that is the potential to overcome everything but there's no reason to unlock that potential until there's a need and in the face of the need god will come up god will manifest himself and god will conquer that thing we want to see god mighty but we don't want to go through trouble we see god mighty when we go through trouble and i want to say god i'm yours i'm yours you have me i'm yours i believe you knew me before the foundation of the world i believe you've ordained the road that i'll take i believe you've ordained my steps and i want to make a declaration and say lord i want to trust you with all of my heart every step of the way help me not to give a negative confession help me not to let doubt and anxiety rule but help me to believe what i believe right now in the face of trial help me to confess what i can confess right now in the midst of a trial god is going to get glory on this earth god is going to show himself mighty on this earth god is going to display his attributes on this earth and he needs a vessel to do it and i want to yield mine to him the potentials where and the seed but god is going to make sure all that potential comes out and gets on display and it's not skipping through a field full of daisies it's in the face of hardship and difficulty i say god you can be god and i want to be your bride let's just pray lord jesus we thank you father god we thank you for your word god it may it made to the carnal mind sound depressing but to the soul it's exciting lord it was when there was five thousand who was hungry then we got a miracle that's in the bible it was in the face of difficulty it was in the face of hardship it was in the face of anxiety you asking your disciples feed these people and they had no way to feed them and there was no there was no way that they could accomplish what you were saying it was in that difficulty you worked a miracle lord that has blessed thousands upon thousands of people who read it lord it was it was when you had to pay taxes and had no cash to pay taxes that you told peter where to go catch a fish with a coin in its mouth lord it's always in these impossible circumstances that you show yourself mighty it's always in the face lord of what can be pressure and stress is when you're just about to do something that's worth a testimony that's worth telling others that's worth writing in your bible god let us not look at the negative side of these things but let's look to the positive side you want to show yourself mighty you want to be a miracle working god you want to heal and you want to deliver and you want to cr you want this bride to crest every wave you want to show where your word is and you want to show where it is not you want to show where your life is lord and you must do it in the backdrop of black and darkness and evil to show where light truly is god i want to be excited to see you move i want to be excited to see lord what you're going to do in these circumstances maybe all around us think that we'll fail maybe all of us even in ourselves the devil causes us to doubt but god i want to get excited in my soul to see what you're going to do how you're going to overcome how you're going to take that word and conquer this situation god let us start to work with anticipation let us start to look lord with excitement because your word can't fail your promises can't fail you're not going to leave us lord and not take care of us you're not going to leave your bride undefended and unprotected and undelivered lord god i pray that you start to put an enthusiasm and an excitement in our heart so we can see you move over every obstacle over every trial god i love you with all my heart lord i long to see you move i long to see you show yourself mighty i long to see your word on display lord let it be in the reality lord let it be in the in the reality of a life lived we love you father we ask that you would take your little bride use us for your glory lord minister your word through us shine your light in this dark world through these vessels of clay that others might find their way to you oh god in jesus christ's name we pray amen how many of you believe we're going to see supernaturally in the bride are we going to see supernatural in the face of no difficulty what do you need the supernatural for if there's no difficulty no strain no impossibility but you only see the miraculous when you're faced with the impossible you only see the supernatural when the natural will no longer work so i believe we're going to see the supernatural hand of god i believe god's made promises to his bride i believe god is going to supernaturally move and deliver on his bride but i believe just like the bible if we're going to see that then we've got to let we've got to convince ourselves now not to be afraid when darkness comes not to be afraid when difficulty comes not to get nervous when the possibilities come amen and there's no natural possibility for a solution we got to tell ourselves now don't get nervous then because that's when he's going to move how many times have difficulties come and god hasn't poured out a blessing tough tough times tough difficult circumstances even difficulties in the church that afterwards god hasn't poured his word out and brought us up higher amen this is the way god lifts you up and you grow something terrible happens and god's word overcomes and you grow you're just difficulty growth difficulty growth difficulty growth it's just the way it is friends and i want to i myself i want to be able to stand still and see the salvation of my god i don't want to be tossed to and fro i don't want to be like the rest of the world i want to be like a child of god and i want a greater i want a greater faith in me i want a greater faith to be expressed out of me that when when when it looks impossible i want to have faith like shamgar had i want to have faith like samson had i want to have faith like the three hebrew children had that's the i want to have faith like daniel had that's what i think is going to be expressed in the bride in this that this day and if it's going to be expressed then he's going to have to put stabilizers on the ship and make us a promise ahead of time so that we wouldn't falter and fail the stabilizers are put on the ship shall crest every wave i'm ready to watch our crest every wave let's sing this song there is a source in times of me that gives me hope that brings me peace my savior stands in my defense all your strength is gone and your

pickle there's no way out i have no idea how god can solve this problem but let's start getting excited together and let's start thanking him for the solution amen because he's made promises to us and those promises can't fail and i'm excited to see what god's going to do for you i'm excited to see how god's going to solve this problem i pray that's how we should talk to one another that's how we
