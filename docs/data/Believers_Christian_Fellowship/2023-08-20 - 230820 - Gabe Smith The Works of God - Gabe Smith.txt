little girl and they're all gifts from God Amen thank God for that when I looked up Priscilla's name Priscilla means ancient which has the the notion of venerable or honorable and Grace means favor and we know that we receive God's unmar favor and may she be a recipient of that as well but also her namesake is Priscilla in the Bible and you might remember that Priscilla and her husband Aquilla were great helps to the Apostle Paul and I pulled this scripture out of Romans 16:3 he referred to aquill and Priscilla he said my helpers in Christ Jesus so may she be one of those helpers in CHR [Music] praise God Amen let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for this life God we receive her as from you Lord God brother Ben and sister Amanda they know the grace of God in

image of his son and that's that's his plan for me so I want to yield to that plan and let let him conform me into His Image God bless you all as you know brother Gabe's going to be taking the service for us this morning and and I asked him just before I left and he graciously accepted and you know brother Gabe's been a friend for a long time he's been fellowshipping here for a little while the Lord led him here to fellowship with he and his family and we've enjoyed having him here enjoyed their Fellowship we've known brother Gabe for many years he's been in the area for a long time been a friend for many years and always known brother Gabe to love the Lord with all of his heart and to be sincere and dedicated to this message and I love that con constancy that God has put in his life and kept him by his grace and I know that the Lord has really blessed our brother and uh I've been enjoying some of those blessings as he shares some testimonies with me and it's been wonderful and and I know he hasn't ministered for a while it's been several years since he ministered and and brother bham said preaching is something you got to stay up with when brother Brenham went 3 months without preaching he felt like he had to get back into it when I go two weeks without preaching I feel like I'm starting all over again but we know that part of the ministry of the gift is the pool of the people amen how many are willing to do your part this morning to help our brother Gabe and to receive from the Lord this morning I want to I want to do my part and I want to receive my portion and I'm not going to depend on on one man to push and do all the labor when I know brother B said 50% of the gift is the people I'm going to be one of the those people today pulling on the gift amen so we want to hear from the Lord we're thankful for our brother and his family and what God's doing in their lives and I'm thankful for the gift that he placed in our brother so I've been looking forward to this all week it's been nice knowing I didn't have to come right back and go right into preaching yesterday was such a nice day for me so thank you brother Gabe for helping me out amen let's just invite brother Gabe with a song will fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quench this thirding of my soul Bread of Heaven feed me till till I overflow here's my cup fill it up and make me whole fill my cup and F my come I lift it up Lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul R of Heaven feed me till I over here's my God fild it up and make [Music] me amen praise the Lord good to be um well I say kind of good to be in the house of the Lord this morning he uh um and uh brother Chad asked me to take the service I I said yes and I was I got to thinking I was like boy Sunday morning everybody there got the thing I said may have been nice been like a Wednesday before Christmas you mean Christmas Eve everybody busy be a handful of people and everybody busy when get to get to the archives and brother Franco mess up technical difficulties Arch I've lost man brother Franco I got to thank you brother I got a C note for you if you can make that [Laughter] happen anyways I I do uh appreciate uh the privilege to stand before God's children this morning and um he um it's been a little bit uh it's uh almost 7 years since I st behind the sacred desk and uh been through a few rough roads and few battles and and um but you know when you go through those things you know um you know how me loves a baby blue sky and a white puffy cloud and my oh man I tell them was my favorite days you know you ever see you ever get out and you walk out and you see one them baby blue skies them white puffy clouds just think of me cuz that that's a that's a brother Gabe day and uh I love them days you know the big I'm not I'm talking about the big big puffy ones you know and uh the puffier the better and uh it just it does something to me and but you know um you never really grow with baby blue skies and white puffy clouds that's right but it a lot of times it just takes the the storms the clouds the thunder rolling and lightning flashing and and you know when you don't know what El to do but look to the Lord Jesus and you feel his arms of embrace wrap around you and you feel pretty good after that you know but and so um I uh it's been uh it's been a minute so I uh if um if it's a bit uh Rusty uh you just uh look over that and and uh I hope you see my heart I um um I'm just so thankful I don't mean to keep you standing but um maybe brother Franco we can uh pull up that that first slide there he got a little power point I uh I'm um I I love doing Powerpoints and it's maybe not so much for the old ones but it's just for for the little ones and um was I I love to I love to be able to look and see the little eyes right over top of the the pews the chairs and you know you put a picture up there and they'll stop playing and they'll look up you know and so it's all part of my master plan is just trying to get to them so uh a lot of times people get critical of uh Power point they say PowerPoint preaching but um you know I believe if brother Brandon was still around he'd be a PowerPoint preacher uh if you uh don't worry I got a quote for it so don't whole fast wait just hold on now but brother Braham said he said that uh how many knows what his uh his dream Church would be he said he'd have Cathedral seating and then he said on the platform he said he'd have his charts that's yeah he said oh yeah he said he have his chars and he said he'd pull down this one and teach from it and then he' pull down another one and teach from that and so uh we just we just living in 2023 and so we're just going to pull down some charts this morning and and teach a little bit so uh so praise the Lord you know and uh so anyway so we'll go into uh 1 John chapter 9 verse 1 um just want to uh read 1 through3 as and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answers neither ha this man said nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest amen in him and I I'd like to speak to you this morning by the help of the Lord on the works of god let's pray precious Lord so thankful for your grace and mercy Lord the life that we lived and Lord mistakes made throughout the week and the sins which are many Lord you've always been so gracious and forgiving so thankful Lord for your hand of Mercy on our lives not just our lives but our families lives our children our loved ones and Lord as we approach your word this morning we just want to surrender yield to you the only way we know how ask that you would have full sway you would have the preeminence we just ask that your word would be able to strike our hearts stir our hearts bring deliverance we could enter into your Joys and your truths Lord and fellowship around your Eternal Word we commit this service into your hand Lord and ask that you just help me to speak speak only the word that you had once spoken give me wisdom and Temperance Lord to not say something that would be unpleasing to you we look to you this morning we love you we praise you and we ask all these things to be so in the name that's above every name amen our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you be seated if you like and uh so uh it's um I got to say um before we start looking at this what a blessing it has been um to Fellowship uh in the assembly the past few months um it has been um absolutely Supernatural um not only for I love seeing your sister Joy smiling she love sister Joy she just but uh I uh it's been just so beautiful to um feel the refreshing of the Lord and to Fellowship y'all have uh welcomed us with Wide Open Arms not just me but my family my wife my children and um I hope you understand not just my words but to see my heart and my sincerity we truly love and appreciate you um and all that you mean to us um you know um sometimes it's hard to uh leave a church and you know you move on and picking up the pieces sometimes can be difficult um but you have made the burden a little bit lighter and uh I'm thankful to be able to uh fellowship with you and I trust that will just be a blessing it's it's been so tremendous overwhelming that I I um you know I don't want to say I fear uh cuz sometimes what you fear will come upon you uh but I I I just concern the Lord it been my prayer is God don't let me do nothing wrong don't let me ruin this you know I just be honest with you and and uh and I don't mean this in a way you know sometimes when people leave a church that they want to frown on this and then you know you're fellowshipping with angels and I I realize y'all ain't Angels you're you're falling just like me but but I I appreciate your sincerity and and the love that's been expressed to us and so uh if it's okay I'm just going to you know just like you got family just you know you ever just scoot somebody over you get in the couch and you move everybody over and that's what I'm going to do I just going to kind of scoot over and nudge you out of the way and make room right and so uh cuz uh I I believe uh uh I believe the family of God is here and by God's grace I'm part of that economy so thankful for his Saving Grace and how how he can pull you out of deari clay and it becomes more than just a song but it becomes your testimony to see God's grace move in your life in a supernatural way and not only that I'm I'm so thankful that uh it's one thing when um when God does something for you but it's a whole another thing when he does it for your whole family you know uh and and no matter how hard you try as a daddy there's some things you just can't do and uh it it makes it hard you know to have to uh I don't mean to say it like this but I just say it I hope you mean to depend upon God especially us us Brethren right you know because we're the man of the house we're the protector we always say that and put a little Bas in the voice right little gravel cuz we want to know you know we're here to protect and we're here to watch over and we're going to make sure you make it but there's there's part part of that that no matter how hard you try without the Holy Spirit you'll be an utter failure and and so I'm so thankful that the Lord Jesus can look at our desire and what we're trying to do and what we're trying to accomplish and then he can provide a way for us and so I appreciate my family uh suffering with me you know um sometimes in life things happen to you don't really understand it you know I just saw a quote I think it was last night night before last and brother bar was talking about um David when uh when uh you know he was at Bethlehem and the Garrison of the Philistines was you know pushing against him and you know uh Saul was coming against him and you know he was brother B referred to him as a fugitive and when he when he's when he's surrounded and and he and B baram said it's summer time and the heat's on him and he's parched and thirsty and he just wants a a cool drink of water from that well of Bethlehem and and brother brandham says that it's amazing how he says it but he he he he says that in David's turmoil in his stress he he uh he um I'm going to be all over the place so I hope you're okay with that uh but he he uh he's all confused and he said how can it be Lord he says you know leaders leaders um PowerPoint is something else um he said uh leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation don't know what they're going through when you think of promises God made and and then why don't it come to pass they don't tell their congregation they don't tell the people they associate with and many frustrations in the heart of a real real leader and but the Philistines was taking advantage of the split between David and Saul and he says he says uh he said oh God how could it be you poured out that oil upon me not because I chose myself but you chose me why did you call me from hurting the Sheep out yonder and told me you'd give me this to serve your people and here you've got me between the fires everywhere and and you think about here he is Anointed of God and you know uh a a man after God's Own Heart and yet it looked like everything was falling apart and a lot of times I'm so thankful that it did because when we in life we can look back at his life and we go we can identify because you know just because we're the elect of God and we can see that by faith we have our name on the Lamb's Book of Life that is not going to uh uh bypass us from trials from stresses a as as as we look at this blind man in in in John you know it it's amazing that when we think of John and and the gospels and we have all four of of the writers and so we can see their perspectives uh and we know that that their their characteristics would would help them to spot certain things that would stand out that John would catch something maybe Matthew wouldn't and and Luke would catch something that John wouldn't and and and so John being The Eagle right he he would catch things that nobody else would and and and you know even even all throughout the ages from the days of John even even through the the church history uh when when you read they used to think that John wasn't even part of the scriptures that because it was so different and it had to be that way when you study history but it was because John was the eagle he was a Heavenly bird he was not Earthly he was not to carry a burden and he was not to look to his intellect and but but he was supposed to fly in the heavenlies and and now we in the last day we can look back and now we can we can understand why John went through what he went through we can understand why John didn't uh maybe people didn't understand John the way we do but it because it wasn't for their time it's for our time and so John when he would pick these things up he would he would catch this blind man and nobody else would it it wouldn't be of significance to to Matthew Mark or Luke but it would only be John that would pick it up and then pick up the the the scroll and the pen and start frighten because we in this last day would be able to look and go that's me amen that that that this man that that had that that had grew up in the church right Mom and Dad were faithful they were so faithful that they wouldn't give up the synagogue when Christ was presented and and so John was was was was was was catching this and this blind man he grew up no doubt in the Christian home Mom and Dad faithful followers faithful Believers right and and and and here he is born blind from birth never seen the breaking of day never seen the light never could see a a baby blue sky or a white puffy Cloud but but one day when when when when when he would meet the king of kings the Lord of lords that that that that that God would by grace would would give him his sight back but but when he when he would receive something that he longed for his whole life when when when Mom and Dad would would would tell him what a baby blue sky is you know it take a cold drink and he go you know it's when you take that that that drink of hot well that's kind of like red right and then Mom would give him a glass of cold water that's kind of like blue right and then and get something super soft you know and let him feel it and goes that's that's kind of like white see how to Pure that is and you know and and so growing up feeling that and and seeing that and and and something that he had no doubt longed for only knowing Blackness and darkness but but then that faithful day amen when he would have those scales removed from his eyes not only naturally right yeah but the most important part spiritually that's right that that when that would when that would happen and and and it would be it would be you know rolled back what it what it opened to him was a trial right you know the the joy was shortlived he he didn't get to enjoy a summer of fun with the mom and dad you know but it but it wasn't just but a few moments and and everybody was upset everybody that should be rejoicing because the greatest miracle that ever happened at that point in time never a blind eye was open right and and now it was folding amongst the elect of God and instead of rejoicing yeah there was really confusion it it was it was really anger yeah because somebody's position was going to be called in question that that that that that Stander that was set was starting to crumble and and and and the Kingdom that the the Pharisees and Sadducees had established was starting to [Applause] break and his eyes no doubt the joy was shortlived I you know I wonder a week two weeks three weeks down the road you think he ever wished his eyes wasn't open yeah yeah oh come on how many is that listen come on friend you you can't tell me in your darkest hour Amen in your darkest hour you think Lord why just like just like David Lord why' you anoint me to see amen yeah right listen friends some sometimes life life is rough life is vicious life life will chew you up and spit you out if you let it you you got to be you got to be a soldier to make it in this last day no no matter how well we try to shelter and protect and watch over our children there's still a battlefield that they must face there's no way around it every one of us must come to that Battlefield every one of us must be tried and tested that's right there's no no way around it no matter how well how much we try to be as parents it's got to happen and the and and you know why it's not just for them but it's also for you it's for me because a lot of times we want to we want to guide them in the way that we want them to go but God may have a different Road for them right and then when when they go a a pathway that you didn't expect that's really a teachable a teachable moment not for them but for you for me because we always we always want safety we always want Comfort right we I I you know I I you my my I tell my children I'm I'm very CDO some of y'all slow OCD excuse me yeah right I'm so organized I wanted alphabetized right CD it's got to be in an order it's got to be the right way right it it it there's a certain way in which we do things in the Smith household right and and and we we love to use the scripture in order to maintain that right but but you know God sometimes he likes a little messy because he's trying to teach us something and and and sometimes we got to realize that everything's not going to be in a nice tidy neat box right but when it's we go through those times that's when we have to be mindful of what who is really in control amen because he's trying to get you out of control so that he can be in control amen that's right and you know uh you know sometimes we why still ain't got off the you know oh my so brother Franco here so brother Franco how many preach I love brother Franco he's so good so I we going to have to pay here we go let's see uhoh uhoh praise the Lord now brother Franco this is where the video can cut off and then you can blame me right there brother you so but you know uh sometimes things happen in lives that are unexpected things things don't go the exact way that you expect them to be and it's it's in those detours or unexpected twists and turns of the road that really shake you to your core and you know uh sometimes and here's the thing it don't necessarily have to be so much as sinful we we ain't talking about you know the television slipping back in or or you know or or uh well it's it's uh football season and you know we ain't talking about that but but sometimes you can be so consumed with church and and your position or whatever it may be that you lose sight of God you know you know you know you know everything that we do is supposed to be as unto the Lord but it's so easy for us to get sidetracked on that I I I I had to learn a a very hard lesson in that you know cuz sometimes you can be so dedicated but you can you can you can get your your dedication off onto the wrong thing and it can be close it it it can be very close but but we God wants us to be be precise he he don't want to get he don't want 99% of your affection he wants 100% he don't want 99% Glory he wants every bit because every bit is due him but a lot of times we as Humanity we get sidetracked and and and and we get off course and and God has a way of getting you back on course and and it's not because he's here to hurt you it's because actually because you're a part of him is why he does what he does a lot of times we think it's God uh uh criticizing us or he don't love us or kicking us around and maybe we think we're an orphan but it's not that it's the fact that you're elect of God is the reason why I let you go through those things and and and a lot of times we go through and it's not about us being good it's about him being good is that right brother Bram says he says every believer in here is a Christian tonight because not that you're good but because God was good to call you you couldn't come yourself your Nature's against it and and somehow in the process of time when we get a few years under our belt and somehow we lose sight of that and and I think sometimes the bottom falls out of it to remind us that it's the grace of God that we're at where we're at and and I'm so thankful for him to be so merciful to us because no doubt that man that was born blind and that you know when his eyes open and and then uh and then the test was on and and we we think that would be a great thing but but then he had to stand the other test of will he stand with Christ or the temptation of his family amen be because that's the same thing we in this last day that are called out of the systems of the synagogue right you know you think well man I stopped drinking I stopped drugging I sto whatever and our eyes get open and we think that's it but that's not it you know I I I thought you know by God's grace when God when when God started dealing with me I knew what the message required I I had grown up in a message home uh broken home but Dad was a Believer and and so I knew the the the standard that was necessary in order to say I'm a Christian and I realized that I couldn't live up to that standard but I didn't understand that the only way I can live up to that standard is by having experience with the holy spirit that takes me to that standard and I and I realized there's no way in order for me to live that but by God's grace he let me uh stop drinking and drugging and things and I got cleaned up before I ever Ste foot in the message church and then once I steep foot in that messy church I realized how sinful I really was right and you know what the longer I stay in a message church I still have that same understanding amen I realize it's the grace of God Lord I need you every every moment of every hour I you know you know it's not just the night that we get saved or the afternoon or the day that we get saved but we need a savior every hour of every moment of every day but somehow we lose sight of needing a savior it's because we get cleaned up a little bit or listen Maybe maybe you never needed cleaned up you you may not be able to relate to it and go I never went there route but but the thing that you have to realize is in your own righteousness that'll still never make Heaven's [Music] Door you need the blood of Jesus Christ regardless and and so God was good to call you but then he was even more gracious to reveal that even though you may not be able to relate to brother Gabe with the tattoos and the ear pierced and and the scars of this world you may never be a able to understand that but you can still put your arm around me and go I need the same Grace that you need Brother G cuz it's it's it's really not about being cleaned up I mean I mean you know Buddhas and muhammadans and they live a pretty good life right right but it but it takes more than that it it takes it takes personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen takes personal experience that you can actually know him in the power of his resurrection and and the fellowship of his sufferings and and a lot of times we want the power of the Resurrection but we want we want to stop at that you know that second part right the second part is the hard one yeah and the fellowship of his sufferings yeah amen praise the lord well you know I I I thought man this uh I told I told my girls I was like boy I don't know I just I'm thinking uh well if it's a good 15 minutes and and they just start laughing oh yeah D yeah you know I get long windy so you have family devotions you know then for you know you know how that Rabbit Trail is and before you know it 45 minutes hour later like you know they're like Dad you know we got to go to bed here pretty pretty soon so praise the Lord I just uh I tell you you know it's it's um this this week has been and I know I'm all over the place but you okay ain't we just family right ain't we just you know you get listen and I I'm sorry to say now listen this service is probably going to be more for me than it is for you you just you just bear with me but but I had to say this the past 3 4 months since I've been here I've actually felt sorry for you cuz every service I'm like boy Lord it just just for me like start to finish you know I mean and I think I feel sorry for my brothers and sisters cuz it's like man I mean well I don't know what they getting because start to I mean you know I mean I'm not saying that even jokingly I'll be honest with you I mean listen all I can say it it's been literally Li the ear amen and I I I don't say that halfheartedly I'm I'm being honest I listen you God God strike me dead if I'm saying this for flatteries I I I I would rather die the death to T to stand behind up here and and be some facade but but but God's Grace has has has literally transformed it like a light switch went off and I think you know I'm talking about from 2016 I don't know where you was in 2016 but from 2016 to 2023 I was in the darkest Valley that I'd ever been in my life I'm talking about you know they talk about functional alcoholics I didn't have no alcohol with no alcoh I was a functional depressed I was functionally depressed and I thought the only thing that got me going from day to day was the fact that I had to be a provider for my children I had to be a provider for my family oh I still had a laugh I still had a smile but there was something deep down on the inside that I just couldn't you know you you just can't you can't get from and you people a lot of people say well just shake it off come on brother brother they ain't never been in them kind of valleys if they say just shake it off a lot of times you think you're a Christian Shake It Off listen sometimes you go through those things in life and you wonder why some you you get tired of saying why Lord why Lord what did I do what did I do and you overturn every stone in your life and you're trying to figure it out and there just is no answer that's where I was and I don't understand it still to this day I don't understand it don't make sense to me but listen God didn't call us to make sense he called us to have faith and and and and that's that's that's what happens in life God is trying to teach us and mold us for a purpose a lot of times we get distracted and we think it's God listen you know that quote where brother Braham said he felt like an orphan I held on to that thing for seven years almost felt like an orphan like God like like like the skies was brassy just and I'm not even talking about I'm talking about a just a dark Haze of brass and and and you and you go through life and you think Lord what what what is going on why why why why is this happening and you trying to make sense of it you know but but I you know what I you know what I realized in in it all it was a tender hand of Jehovah amen and he said oh brother Gabe that's the Jews no that's me that's right that friend that's more than a quote to me that's a reality that that you know sometimes we go through things and we don't understand why but but then I but when I look back I see the Deliverance that was happening in my life amen I I don't you know I don't I tell you I don't understand how this happens outside of I see Naomi and Ruth Naomi was in a backsliding condition cuz she was out of out of Israel yeah but even though she was in a backs sitting condition she still had enough of a testimony that Ruth said your God's going to be my God wherever you go I'm going think about that you know that's why I name my middle one they on me because because I thought I thought that well wife and I but you understand what I'm saying yeah your brother Bob yeah right but but to me for her to be in that backsliding condition but still have a testimony that can reflect in such a way that rof would say no your God is going to be my God and I don't understand how it happens that you know all I can tell you friends that I was I was I was cold I was indifferent I was backslid did I have a 40 dog in my hand no no did I run the bars no no actually friends there was Deliverance in my life that I had struggled with my whole life and I still don't understand outside it was the tender hand of Jehovah that even though I'm in a cold and former indiff State God could bring Deliverance you you you say that can't be I don't I I it's too late because I I I'm the evidence that it can happen and I don't understand it and and I I I I I I don't I don't know I don't know but but all I can say is that it happened in my life and and and when we can when we go I tell you it but it brings you to such a it brings you to a deeper uh relationship with God because then you realize Christ and I hate to say it like this but Christ is in control and he say hate to say like because it's so cliche you know what I mean that's just what the preachers say but no it's not what the preachers I know they may say it but when when you're alone and you're all by yourself and then you see it reflected in your life that God is in control that God only is going to let you go so far and and then he just changes things and sometimes he'll turn you upside down so fast you don't understand it I I I'll be honest with you friends the first day the first day we we we we we came to church we came to church well actually we we streamed for about I don't know 3 four five weeks or something like that you know and uh and we sat at home and and we was watching y'all and uh you know every service is beautiful and we have we' had the family meeting afterwards and uh and everybody loved it you know everybody's good so I said okay well let's we we going let's you want to try it next week well don't about that now you know okay we stream we're streaming other Ser you know cuz see to me friends I don't like that church Hopper you know you know I mean some have you remember about 5 years ago I Church hopped in here and then church hopped out year later y'all remember that I so thankful you know I did that then y'all still welcome me back with open arms that made me Felt So Good Sister Joyce had me back a second time you know what I mean when she called and uh Susan said sister Joyce and went have you over s sister Nancy I did need I said oh really I said well they give me a double portion praise the Lord you know but but see the whole thing of it was it wasn't oh I had you once I ain't going to have you again but see it was welcome back with open arms and you don't know how that ministered to me I just gave me it gave me uh just a little you know but but to me friends it ain't just that but look listen we've had Fellowship after Fellowship after Fellowship every one of you has been so good to us and I brother it make me so nervous I I hate that that camera I just wish we could turn that thing off and it just I just like talking to you you know what I mean I don't mean nothing against can't you understand what I'm saying to me this is just us right and so it didn't makes me nervous cuz I don't want people I just being honest with you but but but but to but to me friends to feel that Fellowship y'all can't fake that you know but then when you see that genu wiess in US Brothers come together you know look first one of the first times we come together what is that slide three oh my what hey look the first time we come together we we went to we went to Brother Shay's I think that the very first time brother Shay now think now watch this this is this so amazing now y'all know me I'm I'm an old Outlaw right I'll just be honest with you am I going to try to fake it the way I talk I mean there ain't no hiding that right all I say is when God called me he didn't change my Linguistics he just changed my vocabulary but I'm still me I'm still brother Gabe I'm still Gabe I mean I can't help it where I've been and what I done been through and and listen when God converted me he didn't give me his Bible in an English book and he didn't give me YouTube classes on how to how to speak orally and how to right you know I you know but anyways but think about this so this listen think think about this I come out preaching like that he' be like Lord let's say hands on brother Gabe Lord have mercy he got a hold of an English book God help him but but think about this uh so brother Shay had us come over and I you know I did tell you brother Shay I could just every time see him with that hat turned down you know like then big old hat and then you know how fast you going boy right you know but think of how God does and that man right there I love him yeah right I I'll be honest with you and we about as opposite look he's from the south right I even said he from the south right from hills of Virginia state boy right police officer trooper and then what is it a tuck seat or suit is put the arms around a pair of overhauls what do we have in common what we have in common is the only thing we need in common and that's the love of God hsaing in our hearts right and and brother what that man did something to me I tell you I go to the ends of the world for him but but because when when he and I could could come together and break bread together it wasn't to sitting across the the table but it was afterward the fellowship amen it was the openness yeah that he could be honest with me and I could be honest with him and I realized that even though he may had a different path than me we're still on the same path right that's what true two fell that's what True Fellowship is Right Two Fellas in one ship right but but it's not just that it's it's all it I just be honest with you I just going to brag on you you know it it's everything it it it's my brother Kyle Brother Kyle and we were closest 19 is to 20 right I'm talking about microns you you people in factories know what I'm talking about somebody like what's a micron right right but but there's something about that man that I I just love but but to me for a man that you can really look and see that he has a love and a burden for young people oh man you know he the man's 10 foot tall and bulletproof in my presence right but but that but that's what I love look at brother Emanuel just a prince you know brother Chad he just it I I'll just be honest with you you know know how we do whenever us us message people say well I'm not lifting up a man always a disclaimer right just give a rose butt and move on my goodness get rid of that pride and that Hess that you always trying to defend and just give a rosebud right we need to be we need to relax a little bit and and stop stressing but every time we make a move we got to have a quotebook to prove our point right be be be be comfortable in who you are and relax we don't need a quotebook to approve our every emotion but but but but brother Chad I tell you brother he's always been a friend to me and I've always admired even when I wasn't a part of the assembly we'd meet together and he'd give me wisdom and advice and we have with you know just different times and and and but then I tell you when I what what I've been listening to it's like you know there's one thing for a preacher to preach you something that he studied but it's another thing when he preaches you something that he's lived it's a whole another book friends and and a lot of times I think we as preachers we're too busy studying the message or or or or studying somebody else's notes to instead of really living this and saying God I want to experience we we we've got this message so figured out but I think sometimes we miss the life right like like like we said we don't mean to but we set the Lord aside cuz we got this under control and instead of just surrendering to him saying Lord You Have Your Way you you you move through through me that's what I want friends I'll be honest with you I I told the Lord Lord I'll be a fool for you is I and that's what I'm doing right now I'll be a fool I I don't want to say these things I don't want to you know and I'm telling you y'all pray for me tomorrow because I'm be so worried about the archives I'm thinking oh man what this oh I cannot be oh I said this and oh my help me Lord right right so don't pray for me right now pray save it for Monday I going to need it I'll be honest with you I'm being awful honest but I just to me I like being transparent I think that's what a real family needs to be we need to be transparent with each other we need to be honest we just need to be open but too many times we try to protect ourselves because we have this facade of being a message believer that we don't make no mistakes we have the word of God we got the Divine interpretation with Vindication on right and we just spit out all the lingos and then we sat back with arms folded and but but really what is that right I mean to me friends I I've come to a place where it's like listen I don't know nothing every everything I thought I knew I realize the longer I'm with the Lord and the longer he leads me it's like God I had that so wrong come on man I had that so wrong my attitude was wrong my Approach was wrong my my Hess was wrong I I didn't have no humility and I thought I did come on right and then I think God what is wrong with me and then I look back and it's like but he's still there he's still there and I'm and a lot of times it just amazes me because then I realized it is the fact that I was a part of him amen before this world ever was and I say that in all humility and and reverence but remember we have to come to that but we have to come to it in a way that we can say it in the right way in a broken way in in a way that's like oh Lord by his grace because you look at all the people that have that have came and went came and went came and went you think of all the people that didn't last a year 6 months in that Darkness [Music] but how is it friends you tell me how is it that we did not do any preparation to come here outside to watch the services I there was no fasting there was no travail there was no there was no pounding on the horns of the altar but how is it that I could put on a suit in in question and wonder and like what's going to happen man it didn't work the last time what if this don't work but I I'm 90 to 95% sure it was either but when I come to about right where brother Ben is it was it was like 50000 lb just lifted off my shoulder yeah God it was either that or the first song I can't remember but I'm almost certain I was about where brother Ben was and it was like a supernatural weight raised off of me amen thank you know and and and for that friends I am so thankful you know to to to to feel God's hand I don't understand why those things happen the way that they do how is it that it it's just God's grace but then it makes you so thankful because it's not just me yeah but then I see my family and all my to to see my wife brother one one time brother brother Chad's preaching and he's preaching on decision remember them them them them lepers remember lepers you know and they we stay here we going to die we go there we going to die we better go there remember brother brother Chad's preaching and my wife she never done this in all her life she that's us and I than you Lord but what one time uh uh on this just testimony you know let uh Brother Kyle asked me to do a little testimony I end up preaching to the young people but Chad asked me to preach and I'm end up testifying so [Laughter] but I mean to me friends I uh I I I can't I can't say this to everybody individually so I just tell all of you you know what I mean so so but but I just want to help I want to encourage you friends because maybe you in that place maybe not to the level but all of us go through those dark times and I'm and I'm here to tell you if God will do it for me he'll do it for you amen and it may not be today it may not be tomorrow it may be two years from now yes but even if it is listen no matter how dark it gets just keep going amen no matter how you feel brother bar said you got to put the stabilizer stabilizers on the ship and and listen the thing of it is I just realized when I was in this dark Time Lord I don't understand it and but I am I I have gone I would tell myself I've gone too far to go back cuz there is no going back yes I can't help out how I feel but but I know this message is real I've seen too much I've experience too much I don't know why I'm where I am but I know that somehow some way it it's got to change but but I you can't make it happen in yourself all you can do is be honest that's all you can do is be honest and go look look you you know I I I remember one time when I was when God was dealing with me and I was in the world I remember being on the dance floor and that brother this man he was having such a good time you know party and everybody going crazy I'm sitting here miserable and I'd look at that man I'd go I remember telling the Lord I said Lord I wish I could be like him and maybe you're in that same position tonight when you are are at church and you look at that man you know somebody shouting acting a fool brother Gabe's on that fifth row balling and crying and a amen and Hallelujah and I'm trying my best to keep it down I promise I could be louder but I I try to I I do cuz I don't want to out preach brother Chad but sometimes I'm like oh brother you just lift the ear but anyway so but but maybe you're in that spot where you looking you go I wish I could be like that brother but you don't know how to be that way because you're so bottled up right but listen just keep moving forward no matter how you feel just keep moving forward be honest with God that's the only thing I can tell you that's the only thing that happened that I did that I know of and I told the Lord I told the Lord I I don't understand I'm better than 4:00 I know I got a wrong attitude I know I shouldn't be feeling this way and I don't know how to change it but some somehow some way in his grace and mercy he changed it for me just and and and so when we go through those moments when we go through those dark times friends just keep moving God's going to see you through it's you know you you look back and I understand that our trials are more precious then gold let's try it in the fire yeah you know we we go through times of of life and and we go through bad times I uh I wonder if I can brother Franco could you pull up that picture with the baby blue skies and white puffy clouds number 30 here we go oh my now then my buddy sent this to me brother Shay he down in the hills of Virginia and I'd said this to the to the young people at youth meeting about the baby blue skies and white puffy clouds see he sent that to me so I can't s him without thinking of you and that's all praise the Lord but you know as beautiful that is the nice Rolling Hills you know I mean amen oh man Breeze about 75 right nice cool breeze Brees oh man but how are we going to grow in an environment like that now we say we want to grow but we want to grow there and a lot of times we spend all our time trying to stay there and and and brother Brenham tells us he says we put too much on mountaintop experience of dancing and shaking and jumping around instead of all night prayer meetings down in the valley of decision where you have to come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place you know I I don't understand why it took so long for me to get where I'm at you know been serving the lord since 2001 man and sometimes I look and I think God I am so far away man I'm not talking about no way out sin but you know what I mean when you look inside you you go God I you hear the message and you you see the things coming across the pull pit and all the different brothers and you're just like oh Lord you know the the messages on love oh how many did oh how many walk walk out fileted oh brother oh it fileted me oh man fileted up one side down the other but how is it that God can filet you and at the end of it you still feel loved Hallelujah you know what I mean like like like like you like oh Lord I know I'm coming up so short but I'm so encouraged how how does that man can't do that that that's listen friends if that was you that was God talking to you that was the grace of God showing you your shortcomings amen right but he didn't show you your shortcomings so that so that he could you know like dangle it like you know like a older brother right look at that Anthony yeah yeah but but God don't God don't do that amen right he you know that's That's what Satan does That's what Satan does Satan Satan Satan I'll show you what he does he loves to do this Satan will put something before you brother brother Franco could you pull up that one with that little trap that little trap it it's back it's back a few slides making it work today there you go right there yep Satan Satan loves to trap you right and and and what he'll do is is he'll make you curious no matter how old you are how young it works with all of us he makes you curious and then once he makes you curious he he'll set the Trap right then then once once he sets the Trap and he and he has you then he shames you then once he shames you he'll isolate you and then once he isolates you he puts fear on you oh yeah and then once he puts fear on you then he wants to destroy you amen and and you know we ought have learned that by now but for some odd reason we still can't get it through our brains the process that he uses and and we live in such an age of deception where there's so many devices and so many ways in which he can trap you because remember Satan sees the whole Spectrum yeah not only does he know you but he also knows your daddy right right and then he don't stop there he was here when your granddad was there right and iniquity will go into the third and fourth generations and he knows what got great Granddad yeah amen and then he knows that family strain that follows that family yeah right amen and and you are sitting up right because he sees Generations think about it friend that's why with no match for him because you may think you got but he'll he'll he'll he'll hit you with a curveball that you never thought was coming and you then he'll say it's your fault yeah when in reality it's not of fact brother brandom said it could have been Grandpa's fault and you're just carrying it I'm all over the place but I got the quote we can look I'll show you later on and and so and so when when Satan moves look look just like Judas what did what did he do to Judas Judas saw the 30 pieces of silver and he saw such value he saw more value in the 30 pieces of silver than he did the king of kings and Lord of Lords the man that turned water to wine fed the multitudes but somehow in that Satan per presented that in such a way that he'd look at 30 piece you think of it I mean I don't know what that was but wasn't 30 pieces of gold it's silver but he presented it in such a way that trapped him he saw greater value in that and the moment that he he he he accepted that that bargain and he kissed the Gates of Heaven on his Road to Hell where was the value in that 30 pieces of silver he he tried to give it back to the priest he wanted to give it back he didn't see no value in it after it was done and that's the same way Satan does all of us maybe maybe not maybe not uh uh selling Christ but but he'll he'll show us uh something that looks valuable young people he'll make you curious and then you'll see the value in it and you'll know it's wrong but you see the value you know you shouldn't do it pastor preached on it brother preached on Mom and Dad devotion yeah right but curiosity it gets so intense that you just can't take it right and then the moment you fulfill that desire whatever it may be then where's the value how many y'all know what I'm talking about come on brothers and sisters emptiness yeah shame amen void emptiness yeah desolate dark there's no hope why should I try I keep messing up and Satan's going amen amen amen right that's how he works that's how he works and then what happens is his shame becomes so so great you know better the prophet said Pastor said Church said Brother Kyle said right brother Kyle just taught on it he just and then you go well there ain't no there's just no sense of me even trying I mean and he goes that's exactly right yeah yeah yep yep yep yep and then before you know it where you at you're isolated I'm not worthy to go to youth meeting I'm not worthy to go to church I'm not and he wears on you day after day after day but listen that's why it's so important for us to have Fellowship listen whenever you you have those times I I would I would highly encourage you to find somebody to talk to and listen parents the the worst thing you can do is be hard on your child when they when they confess to you something they did wrong it's the worst thing you can do the moment you go I to you just help them lay the first brick in building a wall yeah amen and if you look back at your life what it is you're you're venting not because they did it but because you failed and and and and what we have to do is is realize wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute whoaa whoa whoa stop stop realize who's in control you you have to enter in to the sufferings of your children you you know you know remember remember when brother brandom tells sister mey honey she needs a buddy amen do you if you look at that remember brother brandham says honey this is in the name of the Lord yeah right he think about that thus saith the the Lord yeah to us that's right as parents yeah is at some point in time your child is going to need a buddy and brother Benham says honey he tells me I know I'm Comming to you this is in the name of the Lord so so sometimes we look at Thunders and seals and that's the name of the Lord and he's discernment but your child needs a buddy in this dark hour God would so see it fit that he would tell he would give us elect of God by his grace parental advice in the name of the Lord your child will need a buddy at some point in time of life why because we can we can get so we miss the transitions we miss the transitions in parent you say brother Gabe you you only got one teenager I know and I'm sorry but I forgive me I I ain't trying to walk in an area I don't know and so but I you understand what I'm saying I hopefully when all of them get there I'll be able to still live there so bear with me but but but the thing of it is is is is is a lot of times we get so uh revelated that we lose sight of where they are at um let let me find this and let me find this real quick um brother brother brother brother Franco it's uh two slides well you know what here hold on take a break brother take a break you rest brother you just rest watch brother brandom is talking to Billy Paul and and they go to a they go to a restaurant right and uh and and and and and there's the music the juke box is playing in the corner and so and so brother Braham said say and and and uh brother B says course Billy just an adolescent you know he said Daddy ain't that a pretty song now let's put that back now today when we go to Applebee's and your child says Oh Daddy ain't that a pretty song didn't I tell you that's wor but watch what brother brandham says daddy ain't that a pretty song I said what song I didn't know I just isolated myself from [Music] it but I want you to understand and see his his his parental wisdom though he's farther down the road than his child he still has enough understanding to realize my child ain't even on the road and he says he says he says I just isolate myself from it I didn't want to hear it and he said you know Daddy he said you just study the Bible so much and pray so much till the only thing you can think about is Jesus Christ amen I said thank you honey you know some that but he still has enough cuz he's Isola I wonder friends read we pop off to our children are we missing the isolation right we got the head knowledge but it we got the quote books but you know when it's son a man returns he's not going to look at your Mac he ain't coming for your windows he ain't going to look at your files on your phone he's not going to look at your books on the bookcase yeah cuz that's not the best that's not the faith he's coming back for and so the prophet says he says thank you honey I sure appreciate that that's just all you have on your mind mind I said that's all I want on my mind is the Lord Jesus but the thing of it is and and sure we can identify with that but what I love is to be able to see his inside at parenting cuz a lot of times friends we think our children are supposed to be farther down the road than what they really are and we don't give them the grace and the longsuffering that they need to even get on that road right amen just because they was baptized at an early age and they've lived good and they they never had television they never had this and they never had D and you can't tell you don't think when they go to Walmart that that music don't catch them you don't think they have that struggle and if we don't if we don't explain that to them and then talk to them and let them know hey I remember where you were at cuz remember they need to know you know I tell you if there's one thing my children will know how to do when they get older is repent cuz I do it before him all the time you know I hope there's not a parent in here I hope you ought to be able to you listen if you can look back at your life and go yeah I've never done that then brother sister you got some pride you need to deal with yeah and you know what you're doing you're missing sight that you're raising the elect of God and they deserve a sorry just as much as I do or anybody else does if you do something wrong just because your daddy or Mama does not make you immune from repenting to your children come on friends but what happens is is we think well those are my children and I no no no no no no no uhuh no no no no no no they're God's children right and and you know you know you know why listen I I'll tell you this the moment you do what it to do it's not just teaching your children repentance but it's also you learning humility cuz it's really humbling to go to a 6 Seven 8 year old and go sorry amen but it's also liberating amen because really you say yeah but we're supposed to make you're going to make mistakes that's the whole point listen friends that's why we need the grace of God that but but the thing of it is is we got to get out of our listen you're living in a fallen world and in a fallen condition and I don't care how much your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you still make mistakes you still get carnal you still get in the flesh yes and and so it takes us it takes humility it takes humility to be able to Humble ourselves and say I made a mistake I'm sorry I shouldn't have said it like that I got under pressure you know we make mistakes and listen and you know the thing of it is then really what that does is that becomes a teachable moment cuz then you then your children realize okay wow dad makes mistakes okay I see the Chris thing I see him living this life he makes mistakes he repents he he does love God man he don't just act that way at church and man amen they may never say it cuz remember brother Brenham says you'll live your best and your worst in front of your children and a lot of times we leave it up to the youth camp or special services or Brother Kyle or whoever you know uh uh to to to to to to bring them to an experience but actually brother brandom tells us that we're the best person to do it he actually says because they have your nature that's right but what's he telling us he's telling us they are you but then you have to be able to say hey I did that too man I struggle with that same thing and oh man I have that problem too and you know what you're Granddad he used to do that to me and and he shouldn't have done that to me and here I am oh man I thought I was I'm just as bad as him and see but what are you doing you're actually making Christianity real you're making it real friends because and I'm not talking about I got to apologize my children beating my children I went out on drunk I'm not talking about that you understand what I'm saying but I'm talking about the littlest thing I shouldn't have been frustrated when I said I got I got upset and I said that in the wrong tone and I'm sorry see right you know the the other the other day brother Chad I I I made sure the girls listen to that one I said you remember what brother Chad said remember brother Chad said uh he was doing something with the boys and he was all and then sister Angie goes what are y'all yelling about he's like we ain't yelling what are you talking about remember that see I I I I listen I tell the girl remember that one you was listening to that one you [Laughter] see but because girls are sensitive I don't have no boys like that but but there's still this boy in me right and so and so listen we have to realize that Brother Kyle right I figur I get you know I fig y'all get a little amen sign out there somewhere you know man y'all didn't have them I well I tell you what a man brother amen Callie where you at there amen man I feel you at least at least get a teach it brother out of here I'll leave these up pull Pit Brother Chad case Wednesday night brother you may need them man make your own copies right but but the thing of it is friends we I don't know I I got to close I'm close I just to me I just want to say this I I just I'm so thankful if if you don't get anything out of this I just I'm so appreciative of the grace of God his hand of Mercy friend he is he's so precious he he he's so faithful he's so loving he's so kind and and when when we look when we go through life and we we we struggle through things and then and then God just I tell you just like what I was telling brother Ben I know I know why he back there and now I know brother Ben if anybody wants to know that's a spot back there it ain't just for them children there must be something special about that area cuz brother when I got to that spot I'm almost I'm 9 95% sure it was like God flipped a light switch and and I and I'll be honest with you there's no way humanly possible for that to happen the condition that I was in and and the thing of it is it was everything's over you know you know whenever I put whenever I found my seat I don't know two three F Wars behind and uh I I hear this big old amen back behind me like who's this brother back in Amen brother Shay and I'm thinking man right and uh and then I made a couple more rows up they like man this pretty good I made a couple more rows up but but here's the thing it was instantly instantly my amen came back God I'm I'm talking about I'm talking brother listen for for almost seven years you couldn't hardly hear amen it just it wasn't there because but I I'm not a person that can amen just because I got I got to feel it you know what I mean no matter how true it's coming from the pull pit like in my heart I could go that's right yes he's right on the message that's what brother bam taught that's exactly right yes but sometimes you can't vocalize it because it's just not there right but somehow supernaturally it's just the grace of God from the very first service brother it was just instantaneous Deliverance is the only thing I can say amen and and so to me number one the sanctuary I know it's not the sanctuary but just this place the people the atmosphere brother I'm just so thankful for God's grace and I so appreciate the Lord Jesus and what he's done for us not just me but my family and and if and if as the music musicians can come I don't know how long I've been but I don't want to go too long I and and so uh I I I I just want to encourage you friend I don't know if there's somebody out here like that listen just keep moving forward listen look God is no respector a person that's why it's so important for us to to be to to realize God's word that if if God listen how many of us as young people you children if daddy tells you something how many's ever called Dad on the carpet and go you said right you got to be careful right DZ because you know the moment you say we're going to do it hey boom done deal hey nuh-uh that that dad on you Dad you said zip it right remember you that Dad y'all know what I'm talking about when you say well we will go e and there you got to you got to put that disclaimer in there right because you got to put all kind of little catch things and just in case weather's good we have no problems and oh come on dad I get no I got to get the amen sign out again right you young people ought to be like Amen brother Gabe I hear it all the time you know Dad lifts out the he's got the this the sheet in his like he's got all these disclaimers like sign here right right but but the thing of it is with god with if God says something he is obligated to it and God has said something to every one of us every one of us he said this to us and if he did it if he did it for one he has to do it for all right amen now that may seem very very Elementary but we're supposed to be a child and and I think sometimes sometimes as as we uh we we we get so focused on being the bride but but there's also other facets of our Christianity we're also supposed to be as a child right still supposed to have that childlike mentality because we'll know Wise enter Heaven if we don't have that and so God gives us those different things to show us and teach us not only who he is but who we are right we can get so elevated but listen I hope this encourages you that that if if if you can if if brother Gabe can be in that position and then he can be transformed instantly you say brother you say god brother Gabe wasn't praying brother Gabe wasn't studying he wasn't brother Jeremy one of them I think it was brother Jonathan uh bom gner he was like yeah he's like take it EAS this H us brother I know you got Revelations stacked up and I'm like oh boy ain't no Revelations over here brother you know but it was where I was at it cuz I you can't make something happen sometimes you go through dark times but I tell you friends I would never I wouldn't change any of it because where I'm at now where where I see my family at where I see the growth in my my my wife my children friends to me that's Eternal that's right and and and and and so maybe maybe maybe you going through a portion of it to this morning I don't know maybe young people listen Maybe Dad mom's on the mountain top and you're in the valley sometimes that can happen too right but listen that that same mountain tops for you maybe it's just the way you're looking at it because you're praying the wrong way and so and so maybe maybe you got to look in a different angle step back a little bit and go wait a minute what what God what what are you trying to teach me maybe sister you play something softly whatever is on your heart I don't know may maybe maybe listen this yes maybe you're hiding something maybe you know a lot of times we don't talk about unconfessed Sin but I wonder how many have something that they're hiding you you're caught in that trap it's just a it's just you're going around the mountain I'm going to do better I know I can and then something comes back up and it's just like catches you and there's no way for you to break from it and you the value is right there and then in a moment's time you throw away the bag of money and you're like I it's pointless listen you are not the only one that's been there the reason why I say it to you cuz I've been there too but I but I want you to know there's a reality in Christianity that Jesus Christ can set you free from it a lot of times it's pride and we won't we won't humble ourselves on you say you say Dad you're in a valley right now well maybe you got some confession to do to the [Music] children mom you know but so many times we want to insulate ourselves and and we want to protect ourselves and we let pride and all those different things but God's trying to chip away at those but you have to be honest with yourself it don't matter how many years you've been in this and how long and raised in it listen you're still a a fallen human being and Fallen flesh and and you have mistakes just like everybody else else maybe you need to humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and [Music] confess sometimes we let unconfessed sin hinder us for so many years and really it's [Music] Pride we're so ashamed of ourselves and then we push it off and we push it off you know you you you look at that that woman that brother brandham discerned and that woman that cheated on her husband she's a Sunday school teacher she had forgot about it there's one quote well brother Bram says brother Braham says you need to confess that to your husband and she said I did he said you did but not all of [Music] it how many things do we leave out and it's because of Pride because we don't want to admit that part of it we're okay with this but that's just too much I and then we try to reason it and then we wonder why we're hindered in our Christian walk right it may not be adultery friends but whatever it is the point of it is it's Pride it's Pride that gets in our way and then and then that Fang uh uh and and we'll push it aside push it aside push it aside push it aside but then we wonder why we go through so many years of not having that total Victory what was that thing you pushed aside for [Music] years maybe you forgot about it but brother brandham says it's still in that subconscious how many would like how many how many wants the Holy Spirit may maybe maybe you forgot but if you don't have that Victorious life and you and you've been in that Valley for so long to say listen just ask God and say Lord is did I do that do I have pride in that way that's blocked me some way from my the full full access to all my Redemptive blessings how many could raise their hand and say Lord I if there is I want to know Lord Lord Lord help me I I I don't want listen friends I'll be honest with you this is embarrassing to say these things but I would rather say it before you now than have it flashed on the screen back then right because there's no mercy there there's no Grace there it's just judgment but now we can look to God and Grace can be there and we can go Lord I'm sorry I made a mistake I was wrong I shouldn't have been that way maybe we could bow our heads close our eyes [Music] Heavenly [Music] Father Lord so thankful for the grace the mercy is from Everlasting to Everlasting it's been given to us in this last day Lord as your Prophet taught us these divinely revealed truths are sent to us so that we could know how to discipline ourselves Lord this message is so real and so pure but sometimes Lord it gets so hard to be honest with ourselves when we see the failures that we actually possess the inadequacies the shortcomings Lord our family strains things that are so embarrassing we wouldn't want anybody to know it but Lord we're asking that your Holy Spirit would search out our lives God that you would make it known to us Lord the things that are a Miss in our lives Lord and if there isn't anything then Lord help us to have a peace that passes all understanding maybe maybe Lord we're we're just a nervous type person but God might you give us rest if if if everything is clear and Lord just just thinking of your Prophet how he was when he had lied and he' went to his cave and he prayed all day but Lord he said that when he had the satisfaction that he had been forgiven not you had had the satisfaction but that he had had it God might we have that satisfaction no matter how long it takes Lord give us that peace that our souls so desire that our Spirits might be at rest that our minds might be at rest Lord that we could have a comfort knowing Lord that we've made everything right we've overturned every stone and Lord if there's something that comes up might you give us Grace Lord help us to have courage if there's something we got to make right Lord from from 5 years ago 10 years ago 20 that little buzzer goes off in our heart Lord help us to be thankful for the warning that you've given us God I I I want to make sure I'm right before you I stand before your children if I said something wrong or out of the way God forgive me so thankful Lord for what you've done for us just loving and appreciating you I appreciate the church the assembly God their Fellowship their Open Arms I ask Lord that you'd bless them each one God help us to draw closer to you and Lord as our lives are searched out and there's nothing that pops up on the screen the radar Lord my your Holy Spirit just wrap its arms around us in love and refreshing if there be one that's struggling God might you be their portion this morning we look to you for all things God we love you and we praise you and we ask these things to be so in the alls sufficient name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you Saints sure do love and appreciate you brother Chad it's uh it's just good to be in the house of the Lord I hope I didn't say nothing out the way and see it's already happening but you know uh I just want to be honest you know if I can't be honest before you I can't be honest before God you know but we all need each other I'm just thankful for God's grace and mercy that's been given to us could you stand with me [Music] [Music] J well I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see God has been so good to me and when I I think of what he's done and PR that he has brought me from my God so much to thank him for well I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see God has been so good to [Music] me and when I think of what he's done and where that he's brought me from I've got so much to thank him for amen are you grateful to be his amen even in the trials he's teaching us and through the trials he's teaching us they're a necessary part of our life amen and I so was so encouraged by Brother Gabe just being honest just opening his heart and being honest amen how many appreciate brother Gabe and his honesty I love what's real amen and God is real this word is real and we need to be real amen amen we're not all the same but we need to be what God made us to be and we need to be genuine in real so I appreciated that so much today it blessed me and to realize you can go through a dark time knowing the truth having ministered the gospel knowing what's right and wrong you can slip into a valley and go through a dark time that you can't control man it was so encouraging for us to hear that from my brother's been there you can't control it you can't shake it off you can't make it go away all you can do is be real about where you are and still understand I'm a child of God and I believe the word and I'm going to keep marching forward and the best that was the best advice is just keep moving forward no matter where we find ourselves up or down high or low amen it still has to be forward progress even on the mountain toop you got to keep moving down into the next Valley you can never stop yeah amen we're on a journey and in this journey God wants to mold character into us and he wants to make us into his very likeness and it'll take the Mountaintop and the valleys and the good and the bad and everything in between to shape us just want to keep moving forward I wrote down a little something while brother Gabe was preaching that just it just came to me it said in the trial we learn in the trial we learn about ourselves amen good and bad things not every trial produces bad sometimes in the trial you realize you really do believe sometimes it wasn't till the trial came that you knew you really did believe but then sometimes you find some pride you find some self sufficiency you find some things there that you don't like either amen so we learn about ourselves in the trial and we learn about God in the trial we learn about his grace we learn about his Mercy we learn about his forgiveness we learn that his mercies are new every morning we find him a deliver we find him a comforter we find him all these things in the trial and we learn the reality of the word that it's real that it sustains it keeps it encourages it corrects it does everything the word was intended to do so when it comes to the end you can say all things work together for the good I thank God for that I thank God for what he's done in brother Gabe and his family and I'm so glad that he shared that with us God bless you brother how many you going to be praying for brother Gabe tomorrow I don't think he has anything to worry about not a thing to be concerned about it was wonderful but I'm going to start praying for him right now cuz I know how it works it won't be tomorrow amen amen I just want to remind you all we have a fellowship dinner immediately after the service we'd love for everyone to stay if you're a visitor please stay you're marri very welcome stay and have some fellowship with us with that I'd just like to Bow our heads and just thank God for the word dear Lord Jesus I'm so thankful God for your goodness and for your mercy we got to witness it Lord through a testimony from our brother what he's been through Lord the place that he didn't want to go through but Lord you saw fit to take him there because you wanted to show him something you wanted to deliver him you wanted to show how much you loved him and how you'll keep and you'll deliver and that you're the one who's in control so thank you for the lesson that we all learn by that Lord I pray we would walk out of here with courage to keep moving forward no matter where we are to keep moving Lord and you've got a plan for us you have a purpose in our life you have a purpose in every trial and you know what you're accomplishing in our life and God with deep sincerity Lord help us not to forget the challenge at the end of the service to be honest to be forthcoming with our mistakes and our sins and our failures to repent and to confess God if you've pricked anyone's heart here all of us were pricked in one way or another but I pray we wouldn't walk out of here and forget that prick that we would we would move on that Lord that we wouldn't miss our opportun to confess that we wouldn't miss the chance that you gave us to be clean to be free Lord to be Lord to to Humble ourselves but to be free from the trapment of the devil for confession is good for the soul lord there's a way you have of cleansing us and freeing us from the snares of the devil and it's when we can humble ourselves and confess our wrongs and our sins that you can free us from that you've promised you would that if we confess our sins you are faithful and just and will forgive for give us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness give us the courage and the power to confess God we it not fade away that prick that that challenge to our heart that that lump that Rose in the throat when we knew there was something that had to be taken care of Lord may we not pass by and let it go back into our subconscious and move back under the rug but Lord now that you've brought it to a surface I pray that you'd give each one courage to deal with it and take care of it that we might be free Lord for your desire is for us to go free God we pray that you'd humble us forgive us of our pride Lord we're so ashamed of ourselves so ashamed of our humanity and the hybridization we find ourselves in we know it's no fault of our own but Lord still yet it's such a hindrance to us and we give into it so many times we're so sorry Lord by your grace would you lift us up and help us Lord to keep moving forward you've encouraged us Lord help us to put it in action may it bring results Lord in our lives for you spoke it for a reason you had it preached for a purpose and may that purpose Lord bring fruit we love you we commit ourselves to your hand Lord pray that you bless each one as we go from here may we have grown in one way or another God I pray you'd bless our fellowship bless the food that we'll partake of give us strength by it Lord strength by the food and strength by the fellowship may we be a strength to one another as we share with one another mother the things that we learn today the things you're doing in our lives the joy that we have in your word may it be a refreshing time for each one we love you and we ask that you bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you you're welcome to be dismissed as you choose to be you're welcome to stay and pray if something pricked your heart and you want to pray you want to pray at the altar you want to pray your seed don't leave too quickly if there's something you have an opportunity let's not miss our opportunities God does these things for a reason he preaches this way for a reason he has a man open his heart and share for a purpose let's not miss the purpose amen let's take advantage of our opportunity today is the day of salvation amen God bless you let's s will I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see God has
