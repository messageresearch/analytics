[15:06] My boat of life sails on a troubled sea.
[15:13] Whenever there's a wind in my s.
[15:20] But I have a friend who watches over me
[15:28] when the breeze turns into a king.
[15:35] I know the master of the wind.
[15:42] I know the maker of the rain.
[15:49] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[15:52] to shine again.
[15:56] I know the master of the wind.
[16:03] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[16:07] sky.
[16:09] Among the peaks my soul can be found.
[16:16] An unexpected storm may drive me from
[16:21] the heights. It may bring me low, but it
[16:24] can never bring me down.
[16:30] I know the master of the wind.
[16:37] I know the maker of the rain.
[16:43] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[16:47] to shine again.
[16:50] I know the master of the wind. Sometimes
[16:54] I soar.
[16:57] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[17:01] sky.
[17:03] Among the peace my soul can be found.
[17:09] But an unexpected storm may drive me
[17:14] from the heights. It may bring me low,
[17:17] but it can never bring me down. Let's
[17:21] just stand this morning.
[17:23] I know the master of the wind.
[17:30] I know the maker of the rain.
[17:36] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[17:40] to shine again.
[17:43] I know the master of me
[17:52] in the presence
[17:58] of Jehovah
[18:04] God Almighty.
[18:11] Prince of peace,
[18:17] trles,
[18:24] hearts are in
[18:31] the praise
[18:37] of the King
[18:43] in and out of situations
[18:49] that tug a war at me.
[18:56] All day long I struggle
[19:01] for the answers that I need.
[19:08] Then I come into his presence.
[19:14] All my questions become clear.
[19:21] And for that sacred moment,
[19:27] no doubts can interfere
[19:33] in the presence
[19:40] of Jehovah
[19:46] God Almighty.
[19:51] You're the prince of peace.
[19:59] Trles pain
[20:05] hearts are

[20:18] of the king.
[20:23] Through his love, the Lord provided
[20:30] a place for us to rest.
[20:36] There's a place to find the
[20:39] answers
[20:42] in the hour of distress.
[20:48] Now there's never any reason
[20:54] for you to give up in this man.
[21:01] Just slip your way and breathe his pain.
[21:06] We will surely meet you there
[21:13] in the presence
[21:20] of Jehovah
[21:26] God Almighty.
[21:31] He's the prince of peace.
[21:38] Trles Vish
[21:44] hearts are in
[21:51] the presence
[21:57] of the king.
[22:03] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[22:05] Let's bow our heads together.
[22:08] Dear Lord Jesus, once again, we're so
[22:11] thankful that you've gathered us
[22:12] together that you've drawn us by your
[22:15] drawing power, Lord. And we've not come
[22:17] here in vain, but we believe it's an
[22:19] appointed time, Lord, an appointed
[22:22] season. And you've brought us together
[22:24] for a purpose. And God, we've come to
[22:27] hear your word, Lord. We've come to have
[22:29] you speak to our hearts, to bring us the
[22:31] word of life, Lord.
[22:33] And God, we pray now as we turn our
[22:35] attention, Lord, to your word. May you
[22:37] come yourself and operate through a
[22:39] vessel and through a gift that you've
[22:41] placed in a body of clay. And may you
[22:43] come with your own hands and break the
[22:45] bread of life and feed us your waiting
[22:48] children. We yield to you. We surrender
[22:50] to you. We open our hearts to you. May
[22:52] you come and feed us that sustaining
[22:54] portion for the hour we live in. As we
[22:57] surrender to you and give you your
[22:58] place, the place of preeminence, may you
[23:01] take it now. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[23:04] name. Amen.
[23:07] Amen. Just want to say God bless you
[23:08] this morning. It's good to be together.
[23:11] Amen. If you want to take your Bibles,
[23:13] we can go ahead and start turning to
[23:14] First Peter. Amen. But as we turn there,
[23:18] I just want to remind you of the watch
[23:20] night service uh this Wednesday.
[23:22] Wednesday at 8. And then we'll have
[23:24] communion somewhere around 11:30. We're
[23:26] going to try to be done as close to
[23:28] midnight as we can so everybody can get
[23:29] home before it gets too late. And also,
[23:32] I want to remind you, we've said it many
[23:34] times. It's been kind of a a tradition
[23:36] or practice of us. If you've got little
[23:38] children and you're bringing them and
[23:39] you want to bring their PJs and a
[23:41] blanket and just let them crash out in
[23:44] the back and sleep, Amen. That's
[23:46] perfectly all right. It's a special
[23:47] night for them, too. They can they can
[23:49] uh get comfortable there and then you
[23:51] can scoop them up, wrap them up, and
[23:53] take them back home. Amen. Just the
[23:55] kids.
[23:57] Just the kids.
[23:59] Amen. Amen. But it'll be fun for them,
[24:02] too. Amen. Amen. Just want to say uh God
[24:05] bless you to a couple of visitors. We
[24:07] got brother Joel and his family. God
[24:08] bless you. It's always good to have you.
[24:10] They're up visiting family and the Cobb
[24:12] kids are here. God bless you guys. It's
[24:13] good to have you. And I looked out and I
[24:15] saw the Peter Shimes. God bless you.
[24:17] It's good to have both of you here as
[24:18] well. And anybody else is visiting. The
[24:20] Fieldings have some family visiting. So,
[24:22] God bless you all. Amen. It's always
[24:24] good to be together. It's always a
[24:26] privilege. Amen. And so we thank God for
[24:29] that privilege. And we never ever want
[24:31] to take it lightly. It's hard not to. It
[24:33] becomes routine, but we don't want it to
[24:34] be routine. We want to take God's
[24:36] blessings and enjoy them. Amen. Let's
[24:39] look at First Peter chapter 4
[24:43] uh this morning. 1 Peter chapter 4.
[24:46] We'll begin with this.
[24:49] 1 Peter 4 and verse 12.
[24:54] Beloved, think it not strange concerning
[24:56] the fiery trial which is to try you, as
[24:58] though some strange thing happened unto
[25:00] you. But rejoice in so much as you are
[25:03] partakers of Christ's sufferings, that
[25:05] when his glory shall be revealed, you
[25:07] may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[25:11] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[25:12] seats. We're going to look at this
[25:14] scripture for a little bit. And it's
[25:16] it's an interesting scripture. We all
[25:18] know it really, really, really well.
[25:20] We've heard it. I mean, if you've been a
[25:21] Christian for any length of time, you've
[25:22] heard it the entire time duration of
[25:25] your walk with the Lord. But, but still,
[25:28] it hits me with impact every time I read
[25:29] it. Beloved, think it not strange
[25:32] concerning the fire trial. Why is it
[25:34] every time we get a fiery trial, we
[25:35] think it's strange?
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I'm I'm the same as you
[25:39] and you're the same as me. Every time
[25:41] it's like, wo is me. What's happening?
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. Uh but then the uh
[25:49] just this morning I was in the office
[25:51] back there. I was saying what does fiery
[25:53] trial actually mean? It comes from one
[25:55] word. It's not two words in the Greek
[25:56] fiery trial. It's translated fiery trial
[25:59] but it's translated twice in the New
[26:01] Testament as burning. Once as fiery
[26:04] trial it's used three times and it means
[26:07] the definition they give is a burning
[26:09] the burning by which metals are roasted
[26:11] and reduced by a figure drawn from a
[26:14] refiner's fire. calamities or trials
[26:16] that test the character. And I thought,
[26:19] my goodness. And I was in the back just
[26:22] laughing because it keeps getting worse.
[26:24] You know, you keep reading, it's bad,
[26:25] but then you go to the definition and it
[26:27] gets worse. What is this? It's a
[26:29] burning. It's a fire. I mean, that that
[26:31] burns and reduces metal. This is an
[26:33] intense fire.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; This isn't one that burns your little
[26:36] cordwood. Amen. This is one that will
[26:38] reduce down and melt down metal. That's
[26:41] the kind of fiery trial that he's
[26:42] talking about. So he said, "Beloved,
[26:45] think it not strange concerning the
[26:46] fiery trial which is to try you or test
[26:49] you as though some strange thing
[26:51] happened unto you." Amen. Why are we
[26:54] still thinking it's odd? Amen. That's
[26:55] what he's saying. But listen, but
[26:58] rejoice.
[27:00] But rejoicemen
[27:03] in so much as you are partakers of
[27:05] Christ's sufferings that when the glory
[27:06] shall be revealed, you may be glad also
[27:08] with exceeding joy. So, next time you
[27:11] ask yourself, why is this happening to
[27:13] me? Go to verse 13 and says, because I
[27:16] forgot to rejoice.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; God's trying to teach me something.
[27:20] Amen.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, if if you could turn with
[27:25] me to Exodus 15, I'd like to pick up a
[27:28] story here in Exodus 15 and look at at
[27:31] part of the Exodus journey here.
[27:36] And if we could go ahead and pull up the
[27:38] PowerPoint, that'd be great. In Exodus
[27:40] chapter 15, I'm going to start at verse
[27:43] one.
[27:46] And and in Exodus 15:1 is after the Red
[27:50] Sea crossing. So God has delivered them
[27:52] from with a mighty hand out of Egypt.
[27:54] He's redeemed them. Amen. He's showed
[27:56] his glory and his might. They've spoiled
[27:58] Egypt. They've gone out. Then they got
[28:00] stuck in a little bad situation there up
[28:02] against the Red Sea and the armies
[28:04] coming down on them and God parted the
[28:06] Red Sea and brought them across on dry
[28:08] land. And this is this is the response
[28:11] after the waters fell back on the armies
[28:13] of Pharaoh and destroyed the Egyptians.
[28:16] And then verse one verse one then sang
[28:19] Moses and the children of Israel this
[28:21] song unto the Lord and spake saying I
[28:24] will sing unto the Lord for he hath
[28:25] triumphed gloriously. The horse and his
[28:28] rider hath he thrown into the sea. The
[28:30] Lord is my strength and song, and he has
[28:33] become my salvation. He is my God, and I
[28:36] will prepare him in habitation. My
[28:39] father's God, and I will exalt him. The
[28:41] Lord is a man of war. The Lord is his
[28:44] name. Pharaoh's chariots and his host
[28:46] hath he cast into the sea. His chosen
[28:49] captains are also drowned in the Red
[28:51] Sea. So, they're having a rejoicing
[28:54] meeting. They just seen God bring a
[28:56] deliverance that was absolutely
[28:58] supernatural and beyond anything they
[29:00] could have ever dreamed. Amen. When they
[29:02] were sitting up against the Red Sea,
[29:04] hemmed in by mountain range in the Red
[29:06] Sea and Pharaoh's army coming down with
[29:08] the only path of escape that they knew
[29:10] of, they were in a desperate situation.
[29:12] And God performed a a supernatural
[29:15] miracle and and stood the water up as a
[29:17] wall on the right hand and the left. And
[29:19] they walked through on dry ground and
[29:21] got to the other side. And as Pharaoh
[29:23] came pursuing after them, thinking that
[29:24] he can do the same thing. AMEN. GOD
[29:27] CRASHED the walls of water down on them
[29:28] and destroyed them all. And they were
[29:30] thrilled at what they saw God do and
[29:32] began to sing. And Moses wrote a song.
[29:35] Amen. RIGHT ON THE SPOT. And he began
[29:37] singing the song. And and Israel picked
[29:39] it up. Amen. And if you go to verse 20,
[29:42] it says, "And Miriam the prophetess, the
[29:45] sister of Aaron, took a timber in her
[29:47] hand, and all the women went out out
[29:50] after her with timberalss and with
[29:51] dances. And Miriam answered them, sing
[29:54] answered them, sing ye to the Lord, for
[29:56] he hath triumphed gloriously, the horse
[29:58] and his rider hath he thrown into the
[30:00] sea." So Moses uh instantaneously broke
[30:04] into praise and wrote a song. And then
[30:06] Miriam and all the women picked it up
[30:07] and started answering back in song. They
[30:10] were having a jubilee
[30:13] &gt;&gt; because of what God had done for them.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; So let's go to verse 22.
[30:20] So Moses brought Israel from the Red
[30:22] Sea, and they went out into the
[30:24] wilderness of Shure, and they went three
[30:27] days in the wilderness, and found no
[30:29] water.
[30:31] And when they came to Mara, they could
[30:34] not drink of the waters of Mara, for
[30:36] they were bitter. Therefore, the name of
[30:38] it was called Mara. And the people
[30:40] murmured against Moses, saying, "What
[30:42] shall we drink?" And he cried unto the
[30:45] Lord. And the Lord showed him a tree
[30:48] which when he had cast into the suite,
[30:50] there he made for them a statue and an
[30:53] ordinance. And there he proved them, and
[30:55] said, "If thou wilt diligently hearken
[30:57] to the voice of the Lord thy God, and
[30:59] wilt do that which is right in his
[31:01] sight, and will give ear to his
[31:03] commandments, and keep all his statutes,
[31:04] I will put none of these diseases upon
[31:06] thee, which I have brought upon the
[31:08] Egyptians, for I am the Lord that health
[31:11] thee."
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[31:14] So they they come out through the Red
[31:17] Sea
[31:19] and they march they march forward three
[31:22] days and within 3 days time they hit
[31:25] their next trial.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; I mean this is an amazing progression
[31:29] through the book of Exodus and through
[31:31] the Exodus journey you find that it's
[31:34] it's out of the kettle and into the
[31:36] frying pan.
[31:38] It's from one thing to another and and
[31:40] and you begin to wonder why and begin to
[31:43] ask questions. But brother Benham and
[31:45] the scriptures so clearly begin to tell
[31:46] us why and begin to open the
[31:48] understanding for that. Amen. Brother
[31:50] Benham says this in Israel and the
[31:52] church. He said after the big song was
[31:54] over, the big shout and having a
[31:56] hallelujah big time, they started
[31:58] through the wilderness and led them
[32:00] right straight to bitter waters. Isn't
[32:02] that strange? Oh my. right into
[32:05] temptation, right into where the waters
[32:07] was bitter and they couldn't drink. They
[32:09] had nothing to eat, nothing to eat, and
[32:11] the waters were bitter. And look, the
[32:13] stream of Mara, bitter waters, lays
[32:15] right in God's path. He was leading his
[32:18] children. Isn't it strange? Look like
[32:20] God would have bypassed that, but he led
[32:22] them right straight up to that water.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were following the pillar of
[32:27] fire. Listen, Moses wasn't just picking
[32:29] a random path and walking wherever he
[32:31] want and happened to bump into bitter
[32:33] waters. It was God who was leading them
[32:35] in the path. He went three days journey
[32:37] following the pillar of fire who brought
[32:39] them right to Mara. Amen. Mara means
[32:42] bitter and to the pools of bitter water
[32:44] that they could not drink.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; And they begin to murmur and they begin
[32:48] to question Moses. And Moses cried out
[32:50] to the Lord. Amen. And and I I just want
[32:53] you to know three days before they saw
[32:55] one of the most tremendous things that
[32:56] had ever happened on the face of the
[32:58] earth
[32:59] &gt;&gt; and a deliverance that was absolutely
[33:02] unbelievable. There's no way anybody
[33:03] could have fathomemed it or imagined it
[33:05] or come up with it in their wildest
[33:07] dreams and God had done it so
[33:09] miraculously and delivered them. And 3
[33:11] days later they're standing by a pool of
[33:13] water that's too bitter to drink AND
[33:14] THEY START TO DESPAIR and murmur and
[33:16] they don't know what's going to happen
[33:17] to them.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Where did the song go?
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Where was the praise service? Where was
[33:25] the worship now?
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I I don't know if I gave
[33:30] you my title. The bitter waters made
[33:33] sweet. This is what we want to talk
[33:35] about today if God will help us.
[33:38] Amen. Brother Benham says, "Now water
[33:41] represents life." We know that Moses in
[33:43] the wilderness, he smoked the rock and
[33:45] it gave forth waters of life to a
[33:47] perishing people. And I want to talk
[33:49] about the bitter waters. How sometimes
[33:52] life is bitter waters. Sometimes our
[33:55] life can be bitter waters. Amen. But God
[33:59] has a way of making the bittersweet.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you can't bypass the
[34:05] bitter waters of life. Amen. But God has
[34:08] a method. He has a way. He has a
[34:10] solution to the bitter waters. And he
[34:12] can make the bitter waters sweet.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Not tolerable.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; I hope you catch what I'm saying. He's
[34:20] not going to make the bitter waters
[34:22] tolerable. He's not going to help you to
[34:24] barely scrape through the bitter. He has
[34:26] a way of making bitter water sweet.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; You talk about an extreme, friends. He
[34:31] can make He can take the worst and make
[34:33] it the best.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:37] In Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 4, he says,
[34:39] "Now notice, then they came to the
[34:42] wilderness of sin. The waters were
[34:43] bitter." Mara, why did God lead them to
[34:47] bitter waters? Looks like he'd have led
[34:49] them to good water, but he led them to
[34:51] bitter waters so he could prove their
[34:53] faith.
[34:54] Oh, I'm I I just get such a kick out of
[34:57] this stuff.
[35:00] He likes to do it.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; He likes to do it.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; It was his desire to let them by lead
[35:11] them by the bitter waters.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And when they got to the bitter waters
[35:15] and they were thirsty and they were
[35:16] perishing, amen, they needed it for
[35:18] life. They had to have it. There was no
[35:20] other option. And when the waters were
[35:22] bitter, they'd gotten into a desperate
[35:24] situation. Amen. And to them, it was
[35:26] terrible. To God, IT WAS EXACTLY THE way
[35:29] he wanted to lead them. Everything was
[35:31] working out perfectly. It was coming
[35:32] right on time. It was going to
[35:34] accomplish this purpose. It was exactly
[35:36] what he led them there to do something
[35:38] for them, to teach them something, to
[35:40] show them something. To God, it was
[35:41] perfect. To them, it was terrible.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; And he led them to bitter waters so he
[35:47] could prove their faith. He likes to do
[35:50] it.
[35:52] He likes Listen, I see this word.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; He likes to let tribulations come on
[35:59] you.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Show you he can so he can show you his
[36:04] love and his power.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Why does he like to do it? Because he
[36:08] wants to show you how much he loves you.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; He wants to show you how powerful he is
[36:12] and how much he can deliver and what his
[36:14] power is to deliver. He's trying to show
[36:16] us his love and his great power. How can
[36:19] people today who doesn't believe in a
[36:21] miracle working God when tribulations
[36:23] come they just give up and go on? But we
[36:25] believe that God works miracles.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Israel should have believed that God
[36:31] could work miracles. They saw the Red
[36:33] Sea. When they come to bitter waters,
[36:34] what are bitter waters?
[36:37] &gt;&gt; HE JUST PARTED THE SEA. HE'S GOT CONTROL
[36:39] OVER THE WATERS. IF HE CAN PART THE RED
[36:41] SEA, HE CAN CERTAINLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT
[36:43] bitter waters.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THEY FORGOT HE WAS A MIRACLE
[36:48] WORKING GOD. IN THREE DAYS. AMEN. THE
[36:50] TROUBLE CAUSED THE TESTIMONY TO VANISH
[36:53] from their mind.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; And all they could see was the trouble.
[36:58] Oh man, I'm so glad that God sent a
[37:01] prophet and put his word there, gave us
[37:03] all the examples so that we could
[37:05] realize the life we live is perfectly
[37:07] normal.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Orchestrated by God, led by the pillar
[37:11] of fire. Amen. Listen, every time the
[37:14] pillar of fire led them to some new
[37:16] junction in the journey, some new trial.
[37:18] Amen. Then Israel began to murmur and
[37:20] complain, and then he began to want to
[37:22] stone Moses and complain to Moses, and
[37:24] you've led us here. AND POOR OLD MOSES,
[37:26] what did he do? Amen. HE WAS HIS FATHER.
[37:29] THEY COULD SEE THE CLOUD UP THERE, AND
[37:30] THEY COULD SEE THE FIRE, AND THEY COULD
[37:32] SEE FOLLOWING. AND and
[37:34] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[37:38] &gt;&gt; they knew Moses didn't decide to go here
[37:41] and go there. He just followed the
[37:42] pillar of fire and all of a sudden,
[37:44] amen, they begin to murmur and complain
[37:46] and get upset. AMEN. BUT THEY DIDN'T
[37:48] REALIZE GOD WANTED TO SHOW THEM
[37:50] SOMETHING ELSE. AND HE WANTS to show
[37:51] them something else. And he wants to
[37:52] show him SOMETHING ELSE AGAIN. AND EVERY
[37:54] STAGE OF THE JOURNEY, GOD WAS TRYING TO
[37:57] SHOW I'M YOUR HEALER. I'm your
[37:59] deliverer. I'M YOUR PROVIDER. I'M
[38:01] EVERYTHING that you need. WE'RE GOING TO
[38:03] MARCH INTO THE PROMISED LAND, AND YOU'RE
[38:04] GOING TO BE SECURE IN ME. YOU'RE GOING
[38:06] TO BE SECURE in my ability to take care
[38:08] of you.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; He likes to do it.
[38:13] Amen. They should have believed he was a
[38:15] miracle working God. When the next trial
[38:17] came, all you have to do is refer back
[38:19] to the previous.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; When the bitter waters come, just to
[38:24] REFER BACK. IF GOD CAN PART WATERS IN A
[38:26] SEA AND make them stand up like a wall
[38:28] on the right hand and the left, he can
[38:30] certainly do something about this.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope we believers still believe
[38:37] he's a work miracle working God. Not
[38:39] just when the prophet was on the scene,
[38:41] but today he's a miracle working God. He
[38:43] has power over the waters. He has power
[38:45] over the circumstance. He can turn the
[38:46] heart of kings like he turns the rivers
[38:48] of water. He's in control. He can rise
[38:51] nations and topple nations. He can
[38:53] change laws. He can change nature. He's
[38:55] a miracle WORKING GOD. NOT WAS, BUT IS.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; And if he ever delivered you for
[39:01] something, he can still deliver you
[39:02] today. NOTHING'S CHANGED WITH GOD. THE
[39:05] CIRCUMSTANCES DOESN'T CHANGE. THE
[39:07] BITTERNESS of the WATER DOESN'T CHANGE
[39:09] THE POWER OF GOD.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:17] Brother Bam says in the message, I know
[39:20] why does God let troubles come? Good
[39:23] question.
[39:24] God harnesses troubles, puts bits in its
[39:27] mouth, and makes it obey him.
[39:30] And those troubles bring us into a
[39:32] closer fellowship with God.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] How many of you ever you've prayed for a
[39:38] closer walk with God?
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Okay, get ready.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; It's the desire of our heart. It's the
[39:47] desire of God's heart. It's what we
[39:48] want. It's what he wants.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; And he knows how to get us there.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:57] In in the uh let me go here to James.
[40:00] James chapter 1, he says, "My brethren,
[40:03] count it all joy when you fall into
[40:05] diverse temptations."
[40:09] This is another one of those scriptures.
[40:12] This is another one of those scriptures.
[40:14] We think about things in the Bible that
[40:17] are so grand and so big and so miracle
[40:20] working and gifts in operation and and
[40:23] this is one of the most fundamental
[40:25] simple basic commandments that we're
[40:27] constantly failing at.
[40:30] Count it all joy when you fall into
[40:32] diverse temptations, knowing this, that
[40:34] the trying of your faith workketh
[40:36] patience. But let patience have her
[40:39] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[40:41] entire, wanting nothing. So this diverse
[40:45] temptations are doing what? They're
[40:47] trying my faith in a working patience
[40:49] and patience is going to have a perfect
[40:51] work in me. So what is this patience? If
[40:54] we look at the definition of the
[40:55] patience, Amen.
[40:58] uh in the uh definition one down here
[41:01] where it says steadfastness, constancy,
[41:04] endurance in the New Testament, the
[41:06] characteristic of a man who is not
[41:10] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[41:13] his loyalty to faith and piety by even
[41:15] the greatest trials and sufferings
[41:18] patiently and steadfastly.
[41:21] I think that's what God's trying to get
[41:22] us to. I think this is what the the the
[41:26] this is what the manifold temptations or
[41:28] the trying of our faith are trying to
[41:30] work in us. Patience and patience will
[41:32] have a perfect work. Make us perfect and
[41:34] entire wanting nothing. Amen. What is
[41:37] God? What is God trying to work in us? A
[41:39] people who can endure.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Be steady. Be stable. And watch God
[41:47] &gt;&gt; watch God move again. Amen. not not go
[41:50] to woe is me every time, but go to the
[41:52] place where you can say, "Listen, I know
[41:55] my redeemer liveth.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; I know what he's done before, he can do
[41:59] again." Amen. And so these trials, these
[42:02] constant things are trying to get us to
[42:04] this place of a man who has not swerved
[42:08] from his deliberate purpose and his
[42:10] loyalty to faith and piety by even the
[42:13] greatest trials and sufferings.
[42:15] patiently and steadfastly say, "Praise
[42:17] God, God's getting us there."
[42:20] &gt;&gt; That's what he was working in Israel.
[42:23] Brother says, "We want everything, just
[42:25] everything, so we can take it easy and
[42:28] retire and take life easy." Is that what
[42:31] you want?
[42:33] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll stand in that line. I mean,
[42:36] &gt;&gt; but brother says life wasn't intended to
[42:38] be easy.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Life is a struggle. Anything that's got
[42:42] life is a struggling. Look at the trees,
[42:45] how they struggle. Look at everything
[42:46] that's got life. It's a struggle. And
[42:48] when we try to get some kind of a system
[42:50] that takes it easy, then we're wrong.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And we know there's something wrong.
[42:56] Amen. When we TRY TO TO TRY TO MAKE IT
[42:58] all easy and everything's easy and
[43:00] everything's smooth sailing and
[43:01] everything's great. Amen. We're wrong
[43:04] &gt;&gt; because that's not what God's intended.
[43:06] Amen. God's intended for us to learn, to
[43:08] grow. Amen. To see who he really is.
[43:12] In 1 Corinthians 10, he says, "There
[43:16] hath no temptation taken you, but such
[43:18] is common to man. But God is faithful,
[43:20] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[43:22] above that you are able, but with the
[43:24] temptation will also make a way to
[43:26] escape that you may be able to bear it."
[43:30] You know what Paul is telling us? Don't
[43:32] worry, everything's under control.
[43:36] I mean, that's the condensed version,
[43:39] but
[43:40] &gt;&gt; he's telling you, you're not going to
[43:42] get into a tri trial or a temptation
[43:45] that doesn't already have a solution.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. There's already a way of
[43:50] escape. There's already AN ABILITY TO
[43:52] BEAR. GOD'S ALREADY PROVIDED WHAT you
[43:54] need to go through this situation. God
[43:56] has never led you into a situation and
[43:59] then he took off and abandoned you and
[44:01] has no plan. RIGHT.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER TOOK THEM to the bitter waters
[44:06] of Mara without a plan.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; He never took them to the Red Sea
[44:09] without a plan. He never took them into
[44:12] the wilderness where their food ran out
[44:13] and THEY HAD NO CROPS TO GLEAN. THEY HAD
[44:15] NO FRUITS TO PICK OFF TREES. He never
[44:17] TOOK THEM THERE WITHOUT A PLAN. God
[44:20] always knew what he was going to do. IN
[44:22] EVERY TRIAL AND EVERY TESTING, GOD HAD
[44:24] ALREADY HAD A PLAN. He already had a way
[44:26] of escape so that they were able to bear
[44:28] THROUGH THE TRIAL THAT GOD SAW FIT TO
[44:31] LET COME THEIR WAY.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; So is this if this is true then this is
[44:37] true.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; It's always true. It always will be
[44:40] true. It'll never be a time that this
[44:41] isn't true.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So sometimes when we get into the
[44:47] trial, maybe what we NEED TO QUIT DOING
[44:49] IS looking at the trial and start
[44:50] looking away around for the way of
[44:52] escape. Yeah. Yeah.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; So, you know, I can FOCUS ON THE TRIAL
[44:56] ALL DAY LONG, 24/7. AMEN. AND I CAN JUST
[44:59] I can just roll it over in my mind over
[45:01] and over AND OVER. OR I CAN start
[45:02] looking around AND SAYING, "THERE'S NO
[45:04] WAY THAT GOD BROUGHT ME HERE WITHOUT A
[45:05] PROVISION.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; There's a provision for my healing.
[45:08] There's a provision for my deliverance.
[45:10] There's a PROVISION FOR OUR FINANCE.
[45:12] GOD'S GOT A PROVISION SOMEWHERE. There's
[45:14] a way in his word with his spirit to
[45:17] come through." Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; God never led his children to dead end
[45:21] roads without a path.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Brought him to a dead end, but there was
[45:26] a road under the water. They didn't know
[45:27] that.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; He had already paved it. Amen. He
[45:31] already had it laid out.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; But he just had to reveal it
[45:36] &gt;&gt; at the appropriate time.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother goes back here in God's
[45:42] provided way. He said they're down now.
[45:45] When they marched out under there, they
[45:47] got marching orders. They started out
[45:49] when they crossed the bridge, went
[45:51] across, God made a bridge through the
[45:52] bottom of the sea for them. Not exactly
[45:55] where you expect to find a bridge.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Our bridges normally go over the water.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; But God's bridge can go under the water.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So don't already get in your mind
[46:05] figured out how God's going to fix it.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; That's what throws us off. We get narrow
[46:12] vision AND THINK GOD HAS to do it this
[46:14] way because we're always looking at
[46:16] situations humanistically and we always
[46:19] think a provision will come within our
[46:21] realm of understanding and most of the
[46:23] time God will bring a provision from
[46:25] outside our realm of understanding
[46:27] &gt;&gt; so HE CAN SHOW US HOW POWERFUL he is
[46:31] &gt;&gt; that he's NOT LIMITED TO OUR PERSPECTIVE
[46:33] OUR understanding our vision. AMEN.
[46:35] WE'RE WALKING IN this world with
[46:37] blinders on naturally speaking. AMEN.
[46:39] THAT GOD'S not living with blinders. He
[46:41] can see the end from the beginning. He's
[46:42] got every resource at his fingertips and
[46:44] he already knows what he's going to do.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:51] They crossed the bridge to the bottom of
[46:52] the sea. When they got over there, when
[46:55] they needed something to drink, the
[46:56] water's all run out. There was a pool
[46:58] there, but the water was bitter. They
[47:00] couldn't drink it. God had a provided
[47:02] tree.
[47:04] He just walked over there, cut the tree
[47:06] down, throwed it into the pool, drink
[47:09] all you want to. God has a provided way.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to Exodus 15 and look at
[47:15] this.
[47:19] And let's go to uh verse 24.
[47:22] And the people murmured against Moses,
[47:24] saying, "What shall we drink?" And he
[47:27] cried unto the Lord. And the Lord showed
[47:29] him a tree which when he had cast into
[47:32] the waters, the waters were made sweet.
[47:35] There he made for them a statue and an
[47:37] ordinance. And there he proved them.
[47:40] They come to the bitter waters of Mara.
[47:45] And the people began to murmur because
[47:47] they didn't know how to drink this
[47:48] water. They didn't know what to do. And
[47:50] neither did Moses know what to do.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SHOWED HIM A TREE.
[47:57] a tree
[47:59] &gt;&gt; that IF HE WOULD CUT DOWN THIS TREE AND
[48:01] THROW IT INTO the waters, it would turn
[48:03] the bitter waters sweet.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; When did the tree get there?
[48:09] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; DID GOD ALREADY HAVE A TREE?
[48:12] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THEY HAD A PROBLEM,
[48:16] &gt;&gt; DID GOD PLANT THE TREE AND GROW THE TREE
[48:18] AND have the tree there? When they
[48:20] needed the tree, THE TREE WAS ALREADY
[48:21] THERE. GOD LED THEM TO BITTER WATERS. SO
[48:24] WHAT? IT'S BITTER. THERE'S A PROVISION
[48:26] ON THE BANK OF THE WATER. THE VERY PLACE
[48:28] WHERE you're standing and murmuring and
[48:30] complaining and desparing AND LOSING
[48:32] HEART, THAT VERY PLACE ALREADY HAS A
[48:35] PROVISION PROVIDED BY GOD LONG BEFORE
[48:37] YOU GOT HERE.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW BITTER THE
[48:41] WATERS ARE YOU'RE DRINKING RIGHT NOW. IF
[48:43] YOU STAND NEXT TO THAT POOL AND YOU SAY,
[48:45] "I DON'T SEE ANY WAY. I DON'T KNOW. I
[48:47] can't live like THIS ANY LONGER." JUST
[48:49] KNOW THAT SOMEWHERE RIGHT AROUND THAT
[48:51] TRIAL IS A PROVISION THAT GOD THAT GOD
[48:54] ALREADY PROVIDED BEFORE.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY HE'LL NEVER LEAD
[48:59] YOU IN a place. AMEN. WHERE HE'S NOT
[49:01] MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE, AMEN, THAT YOU'RE
[49:03] able to bear.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; HE'S NEVER BROUGHT US ANYWHERE TO
[49:07] DESTROY US. HE'S NEVER BROUGHT US
[49:09] ANYWHERE FOR US TO FAIL. AMEN.
[49:11] EVERYTHING GOD HAS DONE IS TO BUILD US
[49:13] UP, TO SHOW HIS GLORY, TO SHOW HIS LOVE
[49:15] TO US, TO ESTABLISH OUR FAITH, AND TO
[49:17] BRING us into greater endurance and
[49:19] patience to be able to walk this life.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; It's all for our good.
[49:25] And God showed Moses a tree.
[49:28] Oh, I just love the symbolism of the
[49:30] Bible because Christ is that tree.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Amen. If you
[49:36] can't see Christ in every line in the
[49:38] Bible, go back and read it again because
[49:39] he's showing up everywhere. He is that
[49:42] tree. He is the tree of life. HE IS THE
[49:44] ONE. AMEN. That could be thrown into the
[49:46] bitterness of life and make IT SWEET,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; NOT TOLERABLE.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; SWEET, NOT BEARABLE. SWEET.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us. I just say, God, help
[50:00] us to believe the word.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Not help us to endure. not help us to
[50:05] bear down, but help us to believe.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to take faith.
[50:13] Amen.
[50:14] Brother Be goes on to say, "Now when
[50:16] they were there, the waters were bitter
[50:18] and they couldn't drink. God provided
[50:20] away a little old tree swinging there on
[50:23] the bank. Moses just cut it down and
[50:25] throwed it in the water. Changed the
[50:27] whole thing to good, sweet water. Now,
[50:29] when you come up against one of your
[50:31] bitter waters or something another like
[50:32] that, there's a tree tonight,
[50:34] spiritually speaking, hanging over
[50:36] Galatha or the world tonight that'll
[50:39] sweeten any bitter waters that you may
[50:41] be led by. That's right. That Calvary
[50:44] will sweeten any experience.
[50:47] Many times we get into hard places and
[50:49] wonder how. But I shut my eyes sometimes
[50:52] and I think yonder on Galtha where my
[50:54] redeemer bled and died for my life. Then
[50:57] my trials seem so little I just throw it
[51:00] aside and walked on. It makes it sweet.
[51:03] It sweetens every experience I ever had.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS THAT TREE? WHY WAS THAT TREE
[51:11] SITTING ON THE BANK? AMEN. THAT WAS
[51:13] CHRIST AND A TYPE. AMEN. IT was a
[51:15] foreshadow of the tree that would bring
[51:17] bitter TO SWEET,
[51:19] &gt;&gt; DEATH TO LIFE. AMEN. AMEN. AND I CAN
[51:21] IMAGINE, AMEN. AND THEY'RE ALL UH UH
[51:24] GATHERED AROUND THE WATERS AND somebody
[51:26] takes a sip and they smell it and they
[51:27] OH WE CAN'T DRINK. OH, THIS IS HORRIBLE.
[51:29] OH, WHY ARE WE HERE? OH, WHY DID YOU
[51:32] LEAD US HERE? OH, MOSES. OH, GOD. OH,
[51:34] WE'RE IN DESPAIR. OH, EVERYTHING'S
[51:36] RUINED. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And God was sitting in the tree
[51:44] &gt;&gt; just waiting.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; The provision's already here. I'm here.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; You haven't noticed me yet, but I'm
[51:51] here. Right?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; You're not aware of it, but I'm the
[51:54] solution to your problem.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; I mean, how many times they walked
[51:59] around it? HOW MANY TIMES THEY BRUSHED
[52:01] UP AGAINST IT? AND THEY IGNORED IT. THEY
[52:03] ABSOLUTELY IGNORED THE PROVISION.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T NOTICE IT. THEY DIDN'T SEE
[52:07] THAT GOD ALREADY HAD A PROVIDED WAY. BUT
[52:10] GOD SHOWED MOSES. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO
[52:12] SHOW MOSES? AMEN. BY VISION. SO, BY
[52:15] REVELATION, all of a sudden, MOSES GOT A
[52:17] REVELATION. THERE'S A PROVISION RIGHT
[52:19] HERE, FRIENDS. GOD HAS NOT LED US
[52:21] SOMEWHERE THAT HE'S NOT MADE A
[52:22] PROVISION. AND HE SHOWED HIM A TREE THAT
[52:24] IF YOU CUT DOWN THE TREE AND THROW IT IN
[52:26] THE WATERS, IT MAKES THE WATERS SWEET.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; OH, LISTEN. I don't care where you are
[52:32] in life. Amen. There's a tree.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what's happening.
[52:38] AMEN. IN YOUR LIFE, NO MATTER HOW BITTER
[52:41] IT TASTES, AMEN, THERE'S A TREE. THERE'S
[52:43] A PROVISION. THERE'S SOMETHING. IF GOD
[52:45] CAN JUST GIVE A REVELATION OF WHERE the
[52:47] solution is, AND HE IS ALWAYS THE
[52:49] SOLUTION.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; THE SOLUTION IS ALWAYS CHRIST EVERY
[52:53] TIME, 100% OF THE TIME, he is always the
[52:56] solution.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; He comes as a tree. He comes in another
[52:59] way through a different trial. HE COMES
[53:01] SOME OTHER WAY. AMEN. But it's always
[53:03] him.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[53:10] Brother Bam says, "Now remember, he is
[53:12] that tree of life. Contrary to the
[53:14] serpent seed, he is that seed, the
[53:16] woman's seed, the tree of life in the
[53:18] garden. Unless they put forth their
[53:20] hands and move this tree, they'd eat
[53:22] that tree and live forever." And he's
[53:24] the only tree that can be taken that you
[53:26] can live forever. His word is life. And
[53:29] that and that be the word then, the word
[53:32] of God, which Eve turned down in the
[53:34] Garden of Eden. Then here is Christ, the
[53:36] word made manifest. And when he come on
[53:39] earth, he was the tree of life. Do you
[53:40] believe that? And Rome, what did they
[53:42] do?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; THEY CHOPPED DOWN the tree.
[53:46] WHY DID THEY CHOP DOWN THE TREE? TO TAKE
[53:49] THE BITTERNESS OUT OF LIFE.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; LIFE HAD BECOME BITTER BECAUSE of
[53:55] hybridization. AMEN. BECAUSE A FALLEN
[53:57] CONDITION. AMEN. WE WERE STUCK AND
[53:59] TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF DEATH AND
[54:01] DETERIORATION. AMEN. BUT WHAT DID THEY
[54:03] DO? THEY CHOPPED DOWN THE TREE OF LIFE
[54:05] AND HUNG IT ON A TREE IN GALATHA TO DO
[54:07] WHAT? TO SWEETEN THE WATERS OF OUR LIFE.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; TO REVERSE THE DAMAGE, TO MAKE THE
[54:14] BITTER SWEET.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And Rome, what did they do? HE HAD TO BE
[54:20] CHOPPED DOWN. And he was put on a tree
[54:22] of disgrace. Curses he that hang on a
[54:24] tree became a curse for the human race.
[54:27] Amen. The tree was chopped down
[54:30] so the bitter waters could be made
[54:32] sweet. So the promise could be
[54:35] confirmed. So redemption could be
[54:37] purchased.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; So that we could be brought back to what
[54:40] we were always intended to be.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; To take the bitterness out of life.
[54:47] Let's turn to Second Kings chapter 4
[54:49] together.
[54:54] Oh, don't you love him?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love his provisions?
[54:58] Don't you love how he's hiding in every
[55:00] trial
[55:02] &gt;&gt; there waiting for our eyes to come open?
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I wish that I could change just myself
[55:15] overnight.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; I wish that I could go into my
[55:19] programming,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; change a few lines of code. Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Can't do that. But I'm depending on his
[55:28] spirit to lead me into the things that
[55:30] are right by his word.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; To where I no longer go to despair every
[55:36] time something happen something happens
[55:38] in life, but where I begin to start
[55:40] going on a scavenger hunt.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Every time I hit a bitter pool of water.
[55:45] Amen. Um Oh, he's here somewhere.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; He's He's here somewhere. cuz he
[55:54] promised he'd never leave me. He
[55:55] promised he'd never forsaken me. He
[55:57] promised he'd be my guide and my leader.
[55:59] And he hasn't quit the job. Amen. SO,
[56:01] THE PILLAR OF fire has led me here. If
[56:02] he's led me here, he's already got a
[56:04] provision. And if this is bitter water,
[56:06] THEN HE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING TO SHOW
[56:08] HOW MUCH HE LOVES ME AND SHOW HIS POWER
[56:09] TO ME. AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING at the
[56:12] water AND MOURNING OVER THE WATER, I'M
[56:14] GOING TO START SCANNING THE BANKS and
[56:16] say, "Somewhere,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; somewhere there's a provision."
[56:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF EVERY
[56:23] TIME WE ENTER INTO A TRIAL, WE CAN
[56:25] QUICKLY SWITCH SWITCH OUR MIND OVER FROM
[56:27] BITTER WATERS TO THERE'S A TREE HERE
[56:29] SOMEWHERE.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PROVISION. GOD IS HIDING IN
[56:33] THIS TRIAL SOMEWHERE. AND WHEN I FIND
[56:35] WHERE HE'S AT, WHEN I FIND WHERE CHRIST
[56:37] IS IN THE TRIAL, AND THEN ALL OF A
[56:38] SUDDEN, HE'S GOING TO TURN THE TRIAL
[56:40] SWEET AND I'M GOING TO SEE CHRIST
[56:42] WORKING IN MY LIFE.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 4
[56:48] verse 38.
[56:51] And Elisha came again to Gilgal, and
[56:54] there was a darth in the land, and the
[56:56] sons of the prophets were sitting before
[56:57] him. And he said unto his servant, "Set
[57:00] on the great pot, and seize pottage for
[57:02] the sons of the prophets. And one went
[57:04] out into the field to gather herbs, and
[57:06] found a wild vine, and gathered there of
[57:09] wild gourds, his lap full, and came and
[57:13] came and shred them into the pot
[57:15] pottage, for they knew them not." Oh my
[57:18] goodness. Praise God. keeps getting
[57:20] better.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Uh, so they poured out for the men to
[57:24] eat and it came to pass as they were
[57:26] eating of the pottage that they cried
[57:28] out and said, "Oh, thou men of God,
[57:31] there is death in the pot." And they
[57:33] could not eat thereof. But he said,
[57:35] "Then bring meal." And he cast it into
[57:38] the pot. AND HE SAID, "POUR out for the
[57:40] people that they may eat." And there was
[57:42] no harm in the pot.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. They come up to another trial.
[57:48] Amen. where they they they made a
[57:50] mistake and they gathered the wrong
[57:52] ingredients and put the wrong
[57:53] ingredients into the pot and the pot was
[57:56] supposed to be life. It was supposed to
[57:57] be food for nourishment and strength and
[57:59] for life and what was meant to be life
[58:01] became death. And brother Brandham shows
[58:03] this. This is what happens in the
[58:04] seminaries. Amen. They were up there in
[58:06] a seminary and somebody had put
[58:08] something in that wasn't healthy.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; ADDED TO THE WORD, ADDED MAN'S IDEAS.
[58:14] AMEN. THEY PUT SOMETHING in and they
[58:16] didn't know what it was and they were
[58:17] confused themselves and they added IN
[58:19] AND NOW IT BROUGHT DEATH. BUT THERE WAS
[58:20] A PROPHET ON THE SCENE AND A PROPHET ON
[58:22] THE SCENE COULD CATCH THE VISION of how
[58:24] to turn death into life.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; TURN POISON INTO HEALTH. AMEN. WHAT
[58:29] WOULD KILL INTO WHAT WILL SUSTAIN LIFE.
[58:31] AMEN. AND WHAT DID HE DO? HE TOOK A
[58:33] BUNCH OF MEAL. HE SAID, "BRING MEAL."
[58:35] AND BROTHER BAM SAID CHRIST is the meal
[58:37] offering. Amen. And the meal offering is
[58:39] A TYPE OF CHRIST BECAUSE HE'S THE GRAIN
[58:41] AND EVERY THE BUR IS CERTAIN WAY THAT it
[58:43] grinds everything TO THE SAME BECAUSE
[58:45] HE'S THE same yesterday, today, and
[58:47] forever. Cuz the word IS ALWAYS THE SAME
[58:50] IN every age.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And the word, THE MEAL OFFERING, AMEN,
[58:55] WILL ALWAYS HEAL THE POISON.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And he bring me meal. He threw it in and
[59:02] HE SAID, "POUR OUT to the people." And
[59:04] there was no harm in the pot. Brother
[59:07] Bam said the meal offering was Christ.
[59:09] Every burr had to be set the same and
[59:11] every little piece of meal had to be
[59:12] ground the same for the meal offering
[59:14] showing that he is the healer. He sub he
[59:17] substitutes and takes away death and
[59:19] puts life by the two laws. Hallelujah.
[59:22] There where death is one place when
[59:24] Christ comes in life comes in. He's the
[59:27] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[59:30] where there was death, there became life
[59:32] because that Christ was brought in the
[59:34] meal offering.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] He says it again this way.
[59:40] You remember when some of the schools up
[59:42] there didn't know the difference between
[59:43] gourds and peas and throw some wild
[59:46] gourds in a pottage of peas to cook and
[59:47] they cried out, "There is death in the
[59:49] pot." Elijah got a handful of meal and
[59:51] cast it into the pot and said, "Eat."
[59:54] What did the meal do? The meal in the
[59:56] pot changed it from death to life. From
[59:58] a deathgiving resource to a lifegiving
[1:00:00] resource. That's the same thing it is
[1:00:03] tonight where there's death in your
[1:00:05] vessel. Christ throwed into your vessel
[1:00:07] brings you from death unto life.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Christ makes the difference coming into
[1:00:12] the human heart. He gives a peace that
[1:00:14] passes understanding and also it gives
[1:00:16] eternal life. He that believeth on the
[1:00:18] son has eternal life and shall never
[1:00:21] perish.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is still the tree that can
[1:00:27] be thrown into the bitter waters of
[1:00:28] life. He's still the meal offering that
[1:00:30] can be thrown into the pot.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:34] Christ through the Bible comes in many
[1:00:37] forms, through many types, in many
[1:00:39] shadows, many ways. Even after his
[1:00:42] resurrection, Amen. He appeared as a
[1:00:45] gardener to Mary. But then on the road
[1:00:47] to Emmas, he appeared to them in another
[1:00:49] form.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; He showed himself AS PILLAR OF FIRE TO
[1:00:53] PAUL.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; You see, Christ is always around. Amen.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; He's always the provision. He's always
[1:01:04] present. Amen. But but he can hide
[1:01:07] himself in a tree by the bank of the
[1:01:10] water, in a handful of meal offering. He
[1:01:13] can hide himself
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; anywhere in your trial.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; That he wants to.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; He can be in a brother and sister. He
[1:01:22] can be in a stranger.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; He can be he can be anywhere.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; That's why for me, I want life to become
[1:01:34] more exciting.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; When the trials come, because they're
[1:01:40] going to come, you're not going to stop
[1:01:41] them.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire led them from one to
[1:01:44] another to another to another.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Who led pillar of fire?
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Who's leading now? The pillar of fire.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Well, today he's going to bypass all the
[1:01:58] trials like
[1:02:00] We have a better understanding and he's
[1:02:01] kind of different now than he No,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; he's going to lead us from trial to
[1:02:06] trial to trial. But oh, if every trial
[1:02:09] could be a new scavenger hunt,
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; if every trial could be a new new game
[1:02:13] of hideand seek.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Where is he? Show me, Lord. Where are
[1:02:17] you hiding in this trial? Because I know
[1:02:19] you haven't led me here without a
[1:02:20] provision.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I know we haven't come here in vain. I
[1:02:23] know I'm not here without a purpose.
[1:02:25] God, would you show yourself to me?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. like you did to Moses.
[1:02:31] Amen.
[1:02:33] Oh, praise God.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I want to read this quote. A testimony
[1:02:39] on the sea. Said, brother Bram tells
[1:02:43] this whole story, a testimony on the sea
[1:02:45] about the disciples getting in a boat
[1:02:47] and Jesus going to the mountain to pray
[1:02:48] and them crossing, amen, the Sea of
[1:02:50] Galilee. And he says, it must have been
[1:02:52] getting late. They had a great meeting
[1:02:54] that day.
[1:02:56] The sun was going down, setting across
[1:02:58] the little Galilee lake, and they was
[1:03:00] all tired. They were worn out. A great
[1:03:03] day meeting people. He said, "I'm making
[1:03:06] this a drama so the children can catch
[1:03:07] it. I'm glad he made it a drama so I
[1:03:10] could catch it
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm one of the babes."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And everybody was weary and tired. And I
[1:03:17] can see the great brrawy backs of the
[1:03:18] big fisherman as he tugged at the boat,
[1:03:20] pushing it out across the sand until he
[1:03:23] got in the water so that it could it
[1:03:25] would float in the water, climbed up
[1:03:27] into the stern of the boat and took a
[1:03:28] seat by the side of his brother Andrew.
[1:03:30] And all on the bank there must have been
[1:03:32] thousands of people, all some of them
[1:03:34] wiping their eyes from tears and saying,
[1:03:36] "Come back, see us again. Bring him
[1:03:38] back." Amen. Brother said, "This is the
[1:03:41] end of a great meeting." And he even
[1:03:43] begins to talk AND HE SAYS, "ALWAYS WHEN
[1:03:45] YOU'VE had a great meeting, you've seen
[1:03:47] God do great things. It's always hard to
[1:03:49] separate from the people." And that's
[1:03:50] what Brother Ram's showing us here in
[1:03:52] this drama. They're having to separate
[1:03:53] now. And they're saying, "Come back."
[1:03:55] And they're wiping their eyes. They had
[1:03:57] seen God do marvelous things.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And brother goes on to say, "But this
[1:04:02] was real smooth." Talking about the
[1:04:04] water that day. It was a beautiful day.
[1:04:07] And the old sea was just as quiet, not a
[1:04:09] riffle in it. And what a pleasure it
[1:04:12] must have been to dip those ores down
[1:04:13] into that fresh water and bend those
[1:04:16] back to that. And just in time each ore,
[1:04:18] it's like a rhythm when they when they
[1:04:21] make two or three ores and somebody
[1:04:23] would stop and all them wave goodbye and
[1:04:25] on and on till the little group on the
[1:04:26] bank begin to get smaller and smaller to
[1:04:29] them and the little boat got smaller and
[1:04:30] smaller as they went out. Finally, they
[1:04:33] were passing each other out into the
[1:04:35] sea. The sun was getting well down now.
[1:04:38] Just red streaks up in the sky from the
[1:04:40] sun from the distant Galilean mountains.
[1:04:43] And this where brother Brennham begins
[1:04:45] to break into more of the story. They're
[1:04:48] going along and it's a beautiful day.
[1:04:50] It's a beautiful afternoon. The meeting
[1:04:52] is over. Jesus sent them across. He went
[1:04:55] up to pray and the the the the the lake
[1:04:58] is as smooth as glass. It couldn't have
[1:05:00] been better. They're rowing across and
[1:05:02] THEY WOULD JUST STOP every two or three
[1:05:04] rows and wave back to the people and it
[1:05:06] was a glorious and then they start
[1:05:07] sharing testimonies
[1:05:10] but John starts it off and brother said
[1:05:12] it must have been John starting it off
[1:05:15] and John says brothers I want to testify
[1:05:17] for a minute and he says you know all my
[1:05:20] life my my mom used to uh take me up and
[1:05:23] tell me the stories and she told me the
[1:05:25] Exodus STORY AND HOW GOD WHEN they were
[1:05:27] in the wilderness and they had no bread
[1:05:29] and they were starving Amen. HOW GOD
[1:05:31] BROUGHT BREAD. AND AS a little boy, I
[1:05:33] used TO ASK, "OH, MOMMY, DOES GOD HAVE
[1:05:36] ANGELS up there with big ovens? Did he
[1:05:37] bake all that bread for them?" And his
[1:05:40] MAMA WOULD SAY, "OH, GOD'S A MIRACLE
[1:05:42] WORKING GOD. HE doesn't need angels
[1:05:43] baking ovens. God just provided."
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; AND THEN JOHN'S SAYING, "DID YOU SEE,
[1:05:49] BROTHERS, WHAT WHAT THE LORD DID TODAY?
[1:05:51] HE TOOK those loaves and he took those
[1:05:53] fishes and he broke that BREAD AND HE
[1:05:55] FED 5,000. HE SAID, "ISN'T THIS THE same
[1:05:58] one? Yeah.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; ISN'T THIS THE SAME GOD THAT PROVIDED
[1:06:02] FOR 5,000 PLUS men women and children in
[1:06:05] the desert? ISN'T THIS THE SAME ONE THAT
[1:06:07] WAS THERE leading them in in in the
[1:06:10] Exodus providing mana for them then? And
[1:06:12] then Andrew says, "LET ME TESTIFY. I
[1:06:14] WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I saw and what
[1:06:16] happened to me." And then Peter and then
[1:06:17] different ones, they begin to testify.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; They begin to share what they had seen
[1:06:23] in the campaign, what the Lord was
[1:06:25] doing. And it WAS BEGINNING TO DAWN on
[1:06:26] them who this was in their midst. AMEN.
[1:06:29] THIS IS THE SAME LIFE, THE SAME POWER,
[1:06:31] THE SAME ONE. WE'RE SEEING THE same
[1:06:32] things. THE THE BLIND BARAMEUS, HIS EYES
[1:06:35] CAME OPEN, THE LAME, AMEN, ARE LEAPING.
[1:06:38] ISN'T THIS THE PROPHECY being fulfilled?
[1:06:40] And they begin to testify
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; of what God has done.
[1:06:45] And as they were testifying,
[1:06:48] Brother Bam says it this way.
[1:06:52] He said, "Oh, the testimony meeting was
[1:06:56] just getting stirred up good."
[1:06:58] Oh, and you know, the devil happened to
[1:07:00] look down across the hill and found them
[1:07:02] without Jesus. They'd went off without
[1:07:05] him. That's when the devil had his
[1:07:07] chance. He said, "Now I've got my
[1:07:08] opportunity to sink them because they've
[1:07:10] gone on with without their master." And
[1:07:12] what does he do? He brings a a great
[1:07:14] storm up. in the storm. Amen. Begins to
[1:07:16] toss the boat about and begins to to to
[1:07:19] to take them beyond their capability of
[1:07:21] handling it.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; They were fishermen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; They were professional fishermen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; They fished generationally for a living.
[1:07:31] Amen. They knew the boat. They knew the
[1:07:32] ship. Brother Bam said they knew just
[1:07:34] how to handle it. Amen. But the storm
[1:07:36] WAS SO GREAT, THE TRIAL WAS SO INTENSE,
[1:07:39] it took them beyond their natural
[1:07:41] capabilities.
[1:07:44] And they began to despair for their
[1:07:46] life. They began to lose all hope. Amen.
[1:07:50] And that's where brother Bam says this.
[1:07:51] He says all hopes was gone. But you know
[1:07:55] what? He was still watching them.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he climbed up the
[1:08:00] mountain and he was standing up there
[1:08:02] watching them, seeing what they was that
[1:08:04] that they was in trouble. I'm so glad
[1:08:07] that grace is still in existence. If it
[1:08:09] wasn't, we'd all be gone.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY JUST THOUGHT HE WASN'T THERE.
[1:08:14] AND THEY THOUGHT HE COULDN'T HELP. AND
[1:08:16] THEY THOUGHT HE WASN'T NEAR.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND FAR
[1:08:21] AWAY and removed. Amen. From the hand of
[1:08:24] the Lord. THE ONE THAT THEY'D JUST BEEN
[1:08:26] TESTIFYING ABOUT. The one who turned the
[1:08:28] bread and broke THE THE THE FIVE LOAVES
[1:08:30] OF BREAD AND FED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
[1:08:33] THEY WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT
[1:08:35] HE WAS. THE ONE WHO OPENED BLIND
[1:08:36] BARNAMEUS'S EYES. THEY WERE TALKING
[1:08:38] ABOUT HOW GREAT he was. Amen. And then
[1:08:40] they get into this situation WHERE
[1:08:42] ANOTHER TRIAL COMES UP THAT'S bigger
[1:08:44] than they expected. That's beyond their
[1:08:46] capabilities. That's more intense than
[1:08:48] anything they could handle. Brother
[1:08:50] Brandon said THE SAILS WERE TORN. AMEN.
[1:08:52] The ores were broke. AMEN. THEY HAD NO
[1:08:54] OTHER MEANS and no other ability. And
[1:08:57] they began to lose all hope and despair
[1:08:59] for life because they didn't realize he
[1:09:01] has a provision in this, too.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; He's still watching. He still knows. And
[1:09:06] he knows what he's going to do. Yeah.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; NOT FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION, BUT HE'S
[1:09:11] GOING TO INCREASE THEIR FAITH. HE'S
[1:09:13] GOING TO SHOW HIMSELF MIGHTY ON THEIR
[1:09:14] BEHALF. HE'S GOING TO SHOW THEM. HE'S
[1:09:16] GOING TO CONFIRM EVERYTHING they've been
[1:09:18] witnessing AND TALKING ABOUT. THIS TRIAL
[1:09:21] IS GOING TO BE THE CONFIRMATION OF
[1:09:22] EVERYTHING they've been saying.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[1:09:32] He begins to testify.
[1:09:34] Brother Bam says, "What happened when
[1:09:37] the dark hour come along and they
[1:09:39] realized they had not had him with them
[1:09:41] and the first thing you know here he
[1:09:42] come walking to them on the sea? The
[1:09:46] only thing that could help them and what
[1:09:48] did they do? They cried out. They were
[1:09:50] scared of him." Now listen close. This
[1:09:54] is so good.
[1:09:57] They were afraid. Scared of the only
[1:09:59] thing that could help them
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; because it looked spooky. They said,
[1:10:03] "He's a spirit. That's a spirit walking
[1:10:05] in the water." Nothing could do that but
[1:10:06] a spirit. Oo, they were scared. And the
[1:10:08] only hopes they had, they were afraid
[1:10:10] of. That's the same thing tonight. The
[1:10:13] only hope of the coming of the Lord
[1:10:14] Jesus is appearing amongst the people.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; That was the ministry of brother Bam.
[1:10:19] That was the son of man ministry in a
[1:10:21] son of man. And it was scaring people.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And they seen it. They they went to call
[1:10:27] it mental telepathy. They went to call
[1:10:28] it fortuneelling. They want to call it
[1:10:30] every kind of devil that they can be
[1:10:31] called. And it's the only thing that can
[1:10:34] help you. What was the voice that came
[1:10:36] from him? Fear not.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Fear not. Be of good courage. It is I.
[1:10:42] Looked kind of scary at first, but it is
[1:10:44] I. Be not afraid.
[1:10:47] Now, we've had a lot of testimony
[1:10:49] meetings and we see what's happened to
[1:10:51] the church. Don't be scared. He's still
[1:10:53] God. He's just as much God as he ever
[1:10:55] was. Do you believe that? The same
[1:10:57] testimony that he was of them in that
[1:10:59] day, he can believe. We can believe that
[1:11:03] him being the same testimony to us
[1:11:05] today. Can't you believe that?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; It is. You may get into a situation. You
[1:11:10] and I get into him all the time where we
[1:11:12] can't see God. We can't feel God. We
[1:11:15] don't know he's there. It feels like
[1:11:16] he's a million miles away. Amen. And
[1:11:18] that's how they FELT IN THEIR TRIAL. HE
[1:11:20] WASN'T THERE. AMEN. Within arms reach.
[1:11:23] They couldn't talk to him. They couldn't
[1:11:24] GO AND PHYSICALLY GRAB HIM. They didn't
[1:11:26] know. But he was watching THEM THE WHOLE
[1:11:29] TIME, WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME to make
[1:11:31] his appearance. Amen. So that he can get
[1:11:33] the maximum benefit OUT OF THIS TRIAL
[1:11:35] FOR their sakes.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; John
[1:11:45] 6:18 says this, "And the sea arose by
[1:11:49] reason of great wind that blew. So when
[1:11:51] they had rode about five and 20 or 30
[1:11:53] furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the
[1:11:56] sea. And drawing nigh to the ship, and
[1:11:58] they were afraid, but he saith unto
[1:12:00] them, it is I. Be not afraid. Then they
[1:12:03] willingly received him into the ship.
[1:12:06] And immediately the ship was at the land
[1:12:08] whether they went.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; A swamped boat with broken sail and
[1:12:15] broken oars.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He was the provision. HE WAS THE ANSWER.
[1:12:21] ALL THEY NEEDED WAS TO WATCH FOR HIM.
[1:12:23] AND WHEN HE CAME, they received him into
[1:12:26] the boat. And when they received him
[1:12:27] into the boat, instantly they WERE AT
[1:12:30] THEIR DESTINATION. THE PROBLEM WAS
[1:12:31] SOLVED. EVERYTHING WAS FINE. THEY WERE
[1:12:33] ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE PROVISION. AND THE VERY
[1:12:37] PROVISION SCARED THEM AT FIRST. THEY
[1:12:39] DIDN'T REALIZE THIS LOOKS SCARY. I DON'T
[1:12:42] UNDERSTAND THIS. WHY IS IT HAPPENING
[1:12:43] THIS WAY? THIS LOOKS LIKE A BAD THING.
[1:12:45] BUT IT WAS THE VERY thing that they
[1:12:47] needed. It was him coming on the scene.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "It is I. Be not
[1:12:55] afraid.
[1:12:57] Don't be scared. I've been watching you.
[1:12:59] Don't be scared. I've got a provision."
[1:13:01] DON'T BE SCARED. I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO
[1:13:03] DELIVER YOU FROM THIS. I WAS ALWAYS
[1:13:05] GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH THIS TRI. I
[1:13:06] WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BRING YOU TO THE
[1:13:08] OTHER SIDE. AMEN. I TOLD YOU TO GET IN
[1:13:10] THE BOAT TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. I WILL
[1:13:12] TAKE CARE OF GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:13:15] AMEN.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hey, listen. We do what we can.
[1:13:20] We try with the ores and we try with the
[1:13:23] sail AND WE TRY. BUT SOMETIMES WE COME
[1:13:25] to the end of any of our mental power,
[1:13:28] our ability, even sometimes to the end
[1:13:30] of our willpower. We've come to the end
[1:13:32] of all of our reasonings. We've come to
[1:13:33] the end OF OUR STRENGTH. AND sometimes
[1:13:35] you just lay in bed at night with tears
[1:13:37] rolling down your tree cheek and say,
[1:13:38] "God, I can't do it one more day." AMEN.
[1:13:41] BUT INSTEAD OF GOING THERE, WHY DON'T WE
[1:13:43] GO TO GOD? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT
[1:13:45] YOU'RE GOING TO DO. YOU HAVEN'T led me
[1:13:46] here in vain. You've never forsaken your
[1:13:49] children. You've promised TO LEAD AND
[1:13:50] GUIDE ME. YOU'VE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME
[1:13:52] ALWAYS. AMEN. WHY CAN'T WE LAY IN BED
[1:13:54] AND TURN EVIL INTO GOOD? WHY CAN'T WE
[1:13:57] TAKE AND BEGIN TO CONFESS THE WORD AND
[1:14:00] AND AND AND PREDICT GOOD, NOT EVIL?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Why can't we be believers
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE WORD? Let's
[1:14:10] believe the word
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; instead of just GOING TO A SERMON AND
[1:14:13] HAVING IT PREACHED AND SAYING, "THAT'S
[1:14:14] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, BROTHER." AND THE
[1:14:16] NEXT TRIAL WE FALL TO PIECES AND FALL TO
[1:14:18] A A LUMP OF CLAY ON THE GROUND. WHY
[1:14:20] DON'T WE GO AND TAKE THE WORD AND SAY,
[1:14:22] "HE'LL NEVER leave me. HE'LL NEVER
[1:14:24] FORSAKE ME. HE PROMISED TO BE WITH ME
[1:14:26] ALWAYS. He's going to come on the scene.
[1:14:28] IF HE WALKS ON THE WATER, IF HE opens
[1:14:30] the Red Sea, if he becomes the meal
[1:14:32] offering, if he's the TREE IN THE WATER,
[1:14:34] I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'LL COME, BUT I'M
[1:14:36] LOOKING FOR him to come on the scene.
[1:14:39] YES.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; I'M CALLING FOR HIM TO COME ON THE
[1:14:41] SCENE. LORD, I need rescued. LORD, I
[1:14:43] NEED YOU. GOD, SHOW ME LIKE YOU SHOWED
[1:14:46] MOSES. WHERE IS YOUR PROVISION?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. There going to come a time this
[1:14:53] bride's going to be a believer of the
[1:14:55] word. NOT JUST A CONFESSOR, but a
[1:14:57] believer of the word. And she's going to
[1:14:59] act LIKE IT AND TALK LIKE IT AND STAND
[1:15:01] ON IT.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING TO HAVE PATIENCE. PATIENCE
[1:15:04] IS going to do a perfect work where SHE
[1:15:06] THAT THIS BRIDE CAN ENDURE THROUGH EVERY
[1:15:09] TRIAL BEING STEADFAST AND FAITHFUL TO
[1:15:11] THE word
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; and you wonder why we go from trial to
[1:15:16] trial because that's the goal
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; to trust the Lord to trust his word to
[1:15:22] stand fast upon the word of God.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I confess I'm not where I want to
[1:15:28] be
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; but I can confess I'm not what I used to
[1:15:31] be. Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; God is molding us and growing us and
[1:15:34] changing us. Friends,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; if we just keep our eyes focused on
[1:15:38] what's important if we just change our
[1:15:40] expectation.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Why do we always expect bad to happen?
[1:15:44] And why do we always expect to fail?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; I mean, we should expect trials.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's a fair expectation.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; But why can't we expect in every trial
[1:15:54] God's going to do something wonderful?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; That this is the next best thing that's
[1:15:59] ever happened to me.
[1:16:01] right?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Instead of the next worst thing in a
[1:16:04] line of bad things. And I'm just going
[1:16:06] to chalk this up as another horrible
[1:16:07] thing so that every time I'm around
[1:16:09] people and I need sympathy, I'll talk
[1:16:10] about this one again.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's look for every child
[1:16:19] to go into our bag of testimonies.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I want it to go from the bag of trial to
[1:16:24] the bag of testimonies.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And it's going to go from the bag of
[1:16:27] trial to the bag of testimonies when
[1:16:29] Christ comes on the scene. So, where is
[1:16:31] he? Where is he at? Is he on the bank of
[1:16:33] the river? Is he in the meal offering?
[1:16:34] Is he going to come walking on the
[1:16:35] water? I don't know how he's going to
[1:16:36] come, but he's going to come.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. OH, THAT'S JOYFUL EXPECTATION.
[1:16:43] That's hope. AMEN. THAT'S A POSITIVE
[1:16:45] OUTLOOK. That's faith in the word.
[1:16:47] That's believing in the integrity of our
[1:16:50] God.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Why would we expect him not to keep his
[1:16:55] word?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] In Hebrews 13, he says, "Let your
[1:17:02] conversation be without covetousness,
[1:17:04] and be content with such things as you
[1:17:06] have, for he hath said, I will never
[1:17:08] leave thee, nor forsake thee."
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Is it true for you?
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's one thing for it to be
[1:17:16] true. It's something else for it to be
[1:17:18] true to you.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; You know, everybody knew it was true
[1:17:25] that a virgin shall conceive. Everybody
[1:17:27] in Israel,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; they've been taught all their lives.
[1:17:30] They all knew that it was true. A virgin
[1:17:32] shall conceive.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; But to Mary, that truth was different
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; than what it was to everybody else.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; That wasn't a scripture to believe that
[1:17:44] was her life now.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, this isn't a scripture to
[1:17:49] believe. This is our life.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; This is TO BE FLESHED OUT IN US. is to
[1:17:54] be made manifest in you and I.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody believes. Everybody's a
[1:17:59] Christian. Do you believe Hebrews 13?
[1:18:01] Absolutely, I believe it. But how do you
[1:18:03] believe it? Do you believe it as an
[1:18:05] intellectual exercise? Do you believe it
[1:18:06] as part of a sermon? Or do you believe
[1:18:08] it experimentally in your in your life
[1:18:11] every day that this is the truth? He
[1:18:13] will never leave me nor forsake me.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; We say we believe it, BUT WHY DO WE ACT
[1:18:18] like he left us and forsook us?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I will never leave thee, nor forsake
[1:18:26] thee, so that we may boldly say, the
[1:18:29] Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
[1:18:31] what man shall do unto me.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; In Matthew, he says, go you therefore
[1:18:35] and teach all nations, baptizing them in
[1:18:37] the name of the Father and of the Son
[1:18:39] and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to
[1:18:40] observe all things whatsoever I've
[1:18:42] commanded you. And lo, I am with you
[1:18:45] always,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; even to the end of the world.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Is there an expiration date
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; on all way?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; John 14, I will not leave you
[1:18:58] comfortless.
[1:18:59] I will come to you.
[1:19:02] Who's Who's this eye? It's Jesus Christ,
[1:19:05] the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:07] Yet a little while and the world sees me
[1:19:09] no more, but ye see me. Because I live,
[1:19:11] you shall live also. At that day you
[1:19:13] shall know that I am in the Father, and
[1:19:15] ye in me, and I in you.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Is that true? Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's true. Is it always true?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] Brother said, "And maybe tonight you're
[1:19:31] a little sick just to have a little
[1:19:33] child training, just a little testing.
[1:19:37] Don't be discouraged." Oh, praise God.
[1:19:40] Can we say this?
[1:19:43] Don't be discouraged.
[1:19:45] Listen, if you're sick, it's
[1:19:47] discouraging.
[1:19:49] If you're hurting, it's discouraging.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham says it's just
[1:19:55] child training. God's just teaching us
[1:19:57] to overcome. He's teaching us to endure.
[1:19:59] He's teaching us to stay with the word.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. God's on the
[1:20:06] throne. He knows all things. If you were
[1:20:08] truly born of the spirit of God,
[1:20:10] everything's working for our good. He's
[1:20:12] going to make everything right. He
[1:20:14] promised he would. He swore he would.
[1:20:16] He's got to keep that word. He's kept it
[1:20:19] now for thousands of years to every
[1:20:21] believer. Would you be any exception?
[1:20:24] No, sir. We're no exception.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; So, let's not act like we are.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] Let's turn to the book of Ruth. Turn
[1:20:35] with me to the book of Ruth, please.
[1:20:41] Oh, I just get so excited at the word.
[1:20:44] It corrects me. It shapes me. It teaches
[1:20:46] me.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It It shaves me down.
[1:20:52] And And I need shaving down.
[1:21:01] All right. Ruth chapter 1
[1:21:10] and verse 19. Ruth 1 19. So they too
[1:21:14] went unto the went until they came to
[1:21:16] Bethlehem. And it came to pass when they
[1:21:19] were come to Bethlehem that all the city
[1:21:21] was moved about them. And they said, "Is
[1:21:24] this Naomi?"
[1:21:26] And she said unto them, "Call me not
[1:21:28] Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty
[1:21:32] hath dealt very bitterly with me." This
[1:21:35] is the same word as the waters of Mara.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; The same word for bitter. Call me not
[1:21:41] Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty
[1:21:44] hath dealt very bitterly with me. I went
[1:21:48] out full, and the Lord has brought me
[1:21:49] home again empty. Why then call you me
[1:21:52] Naomi seeing the Lord hath testified
[1:21:54] against me and the Almighty hath
[1:21:57] afflicted me?
[1:21:59] Listen, she her name I don't remember
[1:22:01] the name her name right now. I just
[1:22:02] looked it up, but I think it it means
[1:22:04] blessed or something like that. And she
[1:22:06] says, "Why are you calling me blessed?
[1:22:08] Call me bitter."
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; And look at the accusation against God.
[1:22:13] The Lord hath dealt bitterly with me. My
[1:22:16] life is now bitter. Don't call me Naomi.
[1:22:18] Don't call me anything pleasant. Call me
[1:22:20] Mara.
[1:22:22] And this is the way Ruth felt. Amen. And
[1:22:25] she might not be the only one who's ever
[1:22:27] felt this way.
[1:22:29] Amen. But we know the story of Ruth and
[1:22:32] we know the story of redemption and we
[1:22:33] know a kinsman redeemer and Boaz and
[1:22:36] Ruth and all of these things. But when
[1:22:38] we get to the end of the story, when we
[1:22:40] go to chapter 4, turn with me to chapter
[1:22:43] 4, verse 13.
[1:22:47] The end of the story. At the end of this
[1:22:49] book, it says, "So Boaz took Ruth, and
[1:22:52] she was his wife. And when he went unto
[1:22:54] her, the Lord gave her conception, and
[1:22:56] she bare a son. And the woman said unto
[1:22:58] Naomi, the women said unto Naomi,
[1:23:00] Blessed be the Lord, which hath not left
[1:23:02] thee this day without a kinsman, that
[1:23:05] his name may be famous in Israel. And he
[1:23:07] shall be unto thee a restorer of thy
[1:23:09] life, and a nourisher of thine old age.
[1:23:12] For thy daughter-in-law, which loveth
[1:23:13] thee, which is better to thee than seven
[1:23:15] sons, hath borne him." And Naomi took
[1:23:18] the child and laid it in her bosom and
[1:23:20] became nurse to it. At the end of the
[1:23:23] story, what does Naomi receive? She
[1:23:25] receives Christ.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Christ showed up in another form in this
[1:23:30] story. Amen. He was the baby born of the
[1:23:33] gentile bride. Amen. Through the kinsman
[1:23:35] redeemer. Amen. The one that's going to
[1:23:38] be the restorer of Israel. And now
[1:23:40] Naomi, SHE GOES AND DISASTER STRIKES HER
[1:23:42] LIFE. SHE COMES BACK EMPTY. She said, "I
[1:23:44] went full and I come back empty." Well,
[1:23:46] she had left the word. Her husband had
[1:23:48] left the word. Amen. And she comes back.
[1:23:50] HER LIFE IS BITTERNESS. BUT GOD ALWAYS
[1:23:52] knew what he was going to do. God had a
[1:23:54] plan from the beginning. And God was
[1:23:56] going TO GIVE NAOMI CHRIST IN A
[1:23:58] PREFIGURE. She was going to receive
[1:24:00] Christ.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And she WENT DOWN THIS ROAD. AMEN. SO HE
[1:24:04] COULD SHOW HIMSELF MIGHTY ON HER BEHALF.
[1:24:06] SO GOD COULD BRING REDEMPTION in a way
[1:24:08] she never imagined redemption coming.
[1:24:10] Amen. SHE SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF. AMEN.
[1:24:13] AND SHE SAYS, "I CAN'T DO IT." SHE TOLD
[1:24:15] RUTH, "LISTEN, YOU YOU AND YOUR
[1:24:17] SISTER-IN-LAW, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. Go
[1:24:19] marry again. I'M TOO OLD. ARE YOU GOING
[1:24:21] TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER SON TO COME? THERE'S
[1:24:23] NO HOPE OF REDEMPTION. THERE'S NO way to
[1:24:25] GET OUT OF THIS TRIAL. I'M TOO OLD.
[1:24:27] AMEN. IF I MARRY AGAIN, IF I HAVE A
[1:24:29] BABY, ARE YOU GOING TO WAIT 18 years?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Past your time."
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; She couldn't see a solution anywhere.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:42] But God showed up.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; He was always there. Where was Christ?
[1:24:47] He was in Boaz, the kinsman redeemer.
[1:24:49] Christ was on the scene. They came TO
[1:24:51] BETHLEHEM AND THEY STARTED GLEANING.
[1:24:54] WHERE? Where did THEY START GLEANING?
[1:24:55] WHERE DID THEY START PICKING UP LITTLE
[1:24:57] BITS OF FOOD JUST TO SURVIVE ONE DAY? IN
[1:24:59] BOAZ'S FIELD, HE WAS THE TREE STANDING
[1:25:02] BY THE SIDE OF THE WATER. HE WAS WAITING
[1:25:04] TO BE CUT DOWN AND THROWN INTO THE
[1:25:06] WATER. HE WAS THERE TO TAKE THE BITTER
[1:25:08] AND MAKE IT SWEET. IT WAS CHRIST, THE
[1:25:10] KINSMAN REDEEMER.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; HE WAS ALWAYS THERE. HE WAS AN OLD MAN.
[1:25:14] HE HAD NO SEED. HE WAS SITTING THERE
[1:25:16] waiting himself.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD ALREADY PROVIDED FOR NAOMI, BUT
[1:25:22] SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS FINISHED. SHE WAS
[1:25:24] DONE. ALL HOPES are over. SHE GOES BACK
[1:25:27] INTO THE PROMISED LAND, WHICH SHE SHOULD
[1:25:28] HAVE NEVER LEFT. SHE COMES BACK TO THE
[1:25:30] WORD. SHE'S COMING BACK TO THE WORD, NOT
[1:25:33] SAYING, "OH, I'VE COME BACK TO THE
[1:25:34] MESSAGE. I'VE COME BACK TO THE CHURCH.
[1:25:36] EVERYTHING'S FINE." SHE COMES BACK
[1:25:37] SAYING, "EVERYTHING'S OVER. EVERYTHING'S
[1:25:39] FINISHED. I've ruined everything and my
[1:25:41] life IS NOW BITTER." AND SHE HAS NO
[1:25:43] IDEA. Sweetness is coming.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; SWEETNESS IS COMING CUZ SHE'S COME BACK
[1:25:48] TO THE WORD. AND COMING BACK TO THE
[1:25:51] WORD, GOD ALWAYS HAD A PROVISION. IT WAS
[1:25:53] ALREADY there in THE KINSMAN REDEEMER.
[1:25:56] AND NOW the birth from the kinsman
[1:25:58] redeemer and THE GENTILE BRIDE WAS GOING
[1:26:01] TO PRODUCE a baby. And that baby was
[1:26:03] going to be given to Naomi. And this was
[1:26:05] GOING TO BE CHRIST TO NAOMI. AND Naomi
[1:26:08] in HER TRIAL RECEIVED CHRIST. AND HE
[1:26:11] TURNED THE BITTER into sweetness. And
[1:26:13] the women said, "HE WILL BE A RESTORER
[1:26:15] OF THY LIFE AND A NOURISHER of thy old
[1:26:18] age. He will be a blessing to you.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; He was there all along."
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; You just had to find him.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Had to catch a revelation of where he
[1:26:30] was.
[1:26:31] Oh, praise God almighty.
[1:26:36] Praise God Almighty.
[1:26:40] Are you happy to serve God?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; I want to look at one more scripture.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:26:52] spake unto me again. And so go and take
[1:26:56] the little book which is open in the
[1:26:58] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[1:27:00] the sea and upon the earth. And I went
[1:27:02] unto the angel, and I said unto him,
[1:27:03] "Give me the little book." And he said
[1:27:06] unto me, "Take it and eat it up, and it
[1:27:10] shall make thy belly bitter,
[1:27:13] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:27:16] honey."
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; And I took the little book out of the
[1:27:19] angel's hand, and ate it up, and it was
[1:27:22] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[1:27:25] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[1:27:28] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[1:27:30] again before many peoples and nations
[1:27:33] and tongues and kings."
[1:27:36] Amen. This now is the book of
[1:27:39] redemption. There's a book that is
[1:27:40] offered to the bride in the end time.
[1:27:44] But there's there there in the
[1:27:46] scripture, he tells us that this book is
[1:27:49] going to have an effect on our lives.
[1:27:53] And when we're receiving the book, when
[1:27:54] we're when we're taking it in, when
[1:27:56] we're when we're eating it, it'll be
[1:27:58] sweet in our mouths.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But in our belly, when we go, brother
[1:28:04] Benson said, when you go to digest it,
[1:28:06] when you have to live it, when you face
[1:28:07] the rejection that comes with this
[1:28:09] message, it'll be bitter in thy belly.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Has anybody experienced that?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; But the prophet says something else that
[1:28:19] I want to share with you that's amazing
[1:28:21] to me.
[1:28:24] He says,
[1:28:26] "And this sevenfold book of seven
[1:28:28] redemption plans has been brought to
[1:28:30] us." And that's what this book holds.
[1:28:32] Now, we're going to get it over in the
[1:28:33] 10th chapter where this mighty angel
[1:28:35] proclaimed something. And he had a
[1:28:37] little book that John had to eat. And
[1:28:39] when he did, he got it into his belly
[1:28:42] and it was bitter. But in his lips, it
[1:28:45] was sweet. When you have to digest it,
[1:28:48] then it gets bitter. Everybody's against
[1:28:50] you. everybody telling you're a holy
[1:28:52] roll or you're this that or the other.
[1:28:54] You're you're off your head.
[1:28:59] So, it's hard to digest it. But when
[1:29:02] you're testifying of his glory, it's
[1:29:04] sweet in your lips.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to get somewhere now.
[1:29:11] That's all. And when you stand up in the
[1:29:12] meeting, say, "Glory to God.
[1:29:14] Hallelujah." Oh, when you're going
[1:29:15] through that great siege, it's hard. But
[1:29:17] then when you're out of that great seed,
[1:29:19] you can testify of it. Then it's sweet
[1:29:21] in the lips. Brother Benham told us that
[1:29:24] this book that we can eat, which is the
[1:29:25] book of redemption, which is the
[1:29:27] revelation of the hour. Amen. Which is
[1:29:29] THE MYSTERY OF GOD. AMEN. When we take
[1:29:31] that in, it's sweet in our mouth. When
[1:29:33] we when we receive the revelation of it,
[1:29:35] it's everything. It's life. AMEN. IT
[1:29:37] TAKES the bitterness of life and makes
[1:29:38] it sweet. It takes the MISUNDERSTANDING
[1:29:40] OF OUR LIFE AND PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE
[1:29:42] AND SHOWS US WE'RE CHILDREN of God. WE
[1:29:44] WERE ALWAYS PART OF GOD. WE COME FROM
[1:29:46] GOD. WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD. IT'S SWEET
[1:29:48] in the eating. Amen. But when WE HAVE TO
[1:29:50] DIGEST it and start to live this
[1:29:52] manifestation with the rejection and the
[1:29:54] ridicule AND THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ALL
[1:29:56] AROUND, it becomes bitter. But listen,
[1:29:59] the bitter BE CAN BECOME SWEET AGAIN.
[1:30:01] HOW do you take the bitter in the belly
[1:30:03] and make it sweet again? Get it out OF
[1:30:05] YOUR BELLY AND PUT IT BACK ON YOUR LIPS.
[1:30:07] AND WHEN YOU PUT IT BACK ON YOUR LIPS,
[1:30:08] IT'S SWEET ALL OVER AGAIN. TESTIFY OF
[1:30:11] WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. TALK ABOUT THIS
[1:30:14] WORD. TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. TESTIFY OF
[1:30:16] THE GOODNESS OF GOD AND THE TESTIMONY OF
[1:30:19] THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK WILL TAKE THE
[1:30:21] BITTER IN THE BELLY AND MAKE IT sweet
[1:30:23] again.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; KEEP EATING THE BOOK. IT'S SWEET. GOT TO
[1:30:27] LIVE IT. IT'S BITTER. TESTIFY OF IT.
[1:30:30] IT'S SWEET AGAIN. AMEN. CHRIST IN YOU.
[1:30:33] CHRIST THE WORD IN EVERY SITUATION makes
[1:30:36] the bitter sweet.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; TESTIFY OF HIM. TALK ABOUT HIM. AMEN.
[1:30:41] TELL THE WORLD. AMEN. WHAT'S MADE YOUR
[1:30:44] BITTERSWEET?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The problem is when we get in the
[1:30:48] bitterness IN LIFE AND BITTERNESS IN
[1:30:50] LIVING THE WORD AND BITTERNESS AND
[1:30:51] REJECTION AND bitterness and
[1:30:53] misunderstanding AND THE BITTERNESS AND
[1:30:55] TRIALS. AMEN. THEN ALL WE DO IS TALK
[1:30:57] ABOUT BITTERNESS AND THE ONLY THING ON
[1:30:59] OUR LIPS is bitterness.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; BITTER IN, BITTER OUT. EVERYTHING IS
[1:31:04] BITTER. BUT OH, IF WE'LL JUST FORGET
[1:31:07] ABOUT THE BITTERNESS AND JUST TALK ABOUT
[1:31:09] HOW GREAT HE IS, WHAT THIS WORD IS TO
[1:31:11] ME, WHAT THE REVELATION HAS DONE IN MY
[1:31:13] LIFE, WHAT GOD HAS REVEALED TO ME AND
[1:31:15] WHAT this message IS AND WHAT GOD IS
[1:31:17] DOING, IT TURNS TO BITTERSWEET ALL OVER
[1:31:20] AGAIN.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE? WORST DAY,
[1:31:25] HAVING A TERRIBLE DAY, EVERYTHING'S
[1:31:27] GOING WRONG AND SOMEBODY AT WORK ASKKED
[1:31:29] YOU A question
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; and you don't want to talk to them. You
[1:31:32] don't want to share the word. You want
[1:31:34] everybody to leave you alone.
[1:31:37] And all of a sudden they start drawing
[1:31:38] it out and you start telling them, you
[1:31:40] know, the word says this and God this
[1:31:42] and there's a provision here and here's
[1:31:43] my testimony. This is what God did for
[1:31:45] me. And all of a SUDDEN THE BITTER DAY
[1:31:47] JUST TURNS SWEET.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY WERE IN A TESTIMONY ON THE
[1:31:51] SEA. THEY WERE TESTIFYING OF THE
[1:31:53] GOODNESS OF GOD, THE MIRACLES THEY HAD
[1:31:55] SEEN. AND THEN THEY GO INTO A BITTER
[1:31:56] SITUATION. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
[1:31:59] TESTIMONY MEETING? WHY DID IT STOP?
[1:32:03] WHY DID THEY STOP CONFESSING HIS
[1:32:04] GREATNESS? WHY DID THEY STOP CONFESSING
[1:32:06] THE MIRACLES? WHY DID THEY STOP? BECAUSE
[1:32:08] THE TRIAL WAS SO OVERWHELMING, THEY
[1:32:11] STOPPED THE TESTIMONY MEETING. THE
[1:32:13] TESTIMONY MEETING WOULD HAVE KEPT THE
[1:32:14] BITTERSWEET.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHAT HAPPENED ON THE SIDE UH OF
[1:32:20] THE RED SEA? THEY PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE.
[1:32:22] THEY DANCED. THEY SANG. EVERYTHING WAS
[1:32:24] WONDERFUL. THREE-DAY journey into the
[1:32:26] wilderness. 3 days LATER FROM A
[1:32:29] REJOICING TESTIMONY MEETING. AMEN. NOW
[1:32:31] IS MURMURING and complaining and despair
[1:32:34] because we're all GOING TO DIE. AMEN.
[1:32:36] WHERE DID THE SONG GO? SING THE SONG
[1:32:38] AGAIN. AMEN. YOU'RE BESIDE THE WATER,
[1:32:40] THE BITTER WATERS. WHY DON'T YOU GET THE
[1:32:42] TAMBOURINE OUT AND SING IT ALL OVER
[1:32:44] AGAIN and make THE BITTER SWEET WHILE
[1:32:46] YOU WATCH FOR GOD TO COME ON THE SCENE?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; GOD, CHANGE MY WAYS. GOD, CHANGE MY
[1:32:54] HABITS. GOD, CHANGE MY THINKING AND MAKE
[1:32:57] ME ACT LIKE A BELIEVER.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:04] Praise be to God.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where did the song go? Where did
[1:33:09] the testimony go? Where did the great
[1:33:11] things GOD DONE GO? WHY IS IT ALL THAT
[1:33:13] WE CAN TALK ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A
[1:33:15] TRIAL IS HOW BAD IT IS AND HOW BLEAK IT
[1:33:17] LOOKS AND how impossible IT'S GOING TO
[1:33:18] BE AND how everything's about to fall
[1:33:20] apart. LISTEN, GET THAT LANGUAGE OUT OF
[1:33:22] YOUR MOUTH. AMEN. AND PUT SOMETHING
[1:33:24] SWEET BACK INSIDE. AND THE SWEETNESS IS
[1:33:27] THE REVELATION OF THIS WORD. LET'S TALK
[1:33:29] ABOUT JESUS. LET'S TALK ABOUT CHRIST.
[1:33:32] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. LET'S TALK
[1:33:34] ABOUT WHAT HE DID IN THE PAST. WHAT DO
[1:33:36] WE EXPECT HIM TO DO TODAY? AND WHAT
[1:33:38] WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIM TO DO TOMORROW.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; If he came WALKING ON THE WATER, HE CAN
[1:33:45] STILL COME WALKING ON THE WATER.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; If he can rain mana from heaven, HE CAN
[1:33:50] STILL RAIN MANA FROM HEAVEN. I DON'T
[1:33:52] KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO COME, BUT HE'S
[1:33:54] GOING TO COME.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO REJOICE WHEN HE COMES IN A
[1:33:59] MEAL OFFERING. AND I WANT TO REJOICE
[1:34:01] WHEN HE COMES IN a tree. AND I WANT TO
[1:34:03] REJOICE WHEN HE COMES HOWEVER HE COMES.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I want to look for his provision.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we serve a mighty God. AMEN. WE
[1:34:11] SERVE A GOD WHO'S NEVER FAILED. AMEN. WE
[1:34:13] SERVE A GOD WHO CANNOT FAIL. AND HIS
[1:34:15] PROMISES TO US ARE SURE.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Let's put the honey back in our mouth.
[1:34:24] Let's eat the word, not the bitterness
[1:34:28] of life.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Will he still lead us by bitter waters?
[1:34:32] Absolutely.
[1:34:34] But if they would have just kept singing
[1:34:36] the song from three days ago,
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; I got a feeling it would have encouraged
[1:34:40] them.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Instead of writing a new song,
[1:34:45] we're all going to die.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Thirsty. So thirsty. Yeah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; With nothing good to drink.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Is this life?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; This is life.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I want to live a different kind of life.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; I want to count it all joy.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; I want to move to expectation. Not
[1:35:10] expectation for evil, expectation for
[1:35:13] good.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Because he says, "I know. I know the
[1:35:16] plans I have for you."
[1:35:20] that bring you to an expected plans of
[1:35:22] good and not of evil to bring you to an
[1:35:24] expected end.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can claim all the words. We can
[1:35:30] shout all the praises. We can say
[1:35:32] everything that we've said today. We can
[1:35:34] say it all. Amen. It can just be words.
[1:35:36] But I want it to be more than words. I
[1:35:38] want to be this word. I want to be to me
[1:35:40] what God will a virgin shall conserve
[1:35:43] meant to Mary.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. Amen. It meant
[1:35:48] something different to Mary than to the
[1:35:50] high priest who was chanting it in the
[1:35:51] temple.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; All the priests could say every Sunday
[1:35:56] they could say, "A VIRGIN SHALL
[1:35:57] CONCEIVE." WE WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL, "A
[1:35:59] VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE." And we believe
[1:36:00] that, don't we? And everybody say,
[1:36:01] "Amen. WE BELIEVE IT. A VIRGIN SHALL
[1:36:03] CONCEIVE." WE ALL BELIEVE THAT.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; But Mary believed it differently.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's the way I want this word to be in
[1:36:13] my life. I want it to be the reality of
[1:36:16] my life. I want it to be my bread. I
[1:36:18] want it to be my portion. I want it to
[1:36:19] be the words that guide my words is this
[1:36:22] word.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Help me, God.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Help me, God.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; There is a provision that can turn all
[1:36:34] the bitter waters sweet.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; That provision hasn't went anywhere.
[1:36:38] He's still here.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will be with you always,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; even to the end of the world."
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where is he? He might be in a
[1:36:47] little bush on the bank of the water
[1:36:48] just watching.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; I wonder when they'll notice I'm here.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I wonder when they'll see I'm still
[1:36:56] here.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus came walking on the water.
[1:37:00] How long he was walking before they
[1:37:01] noticed him? I don't know.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; He was walking and he was just waiting
[1:37:06] for them to see
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; that I'm here. I've showed up. I've come
[1:37:11] in the midst of your trial. I'm here.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. And all of a SUDDEN THEY SAW IT
[1:37:16] ONLY THEY DIDN'T SEE IT as provision.
[1:37:18] They saw it as SOMETHING SCARIER ON TOP
[1:37:20] OF WHAT WAS SCARY.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; OH, sometimes the very thing God's going
[1:37:24] to do to solve our problem looks scarier
[1:37:26] than the problem.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; But that's when we have to trust him.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; God, I don't know what you're doing, but
[1:37:33] I know you're doing something.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; And if you can open my eyes like you
[1:37:36] open Moses' eyes so I can see where's
[1:37:39] your provision in this trial.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Is it here? There. Where is it? What's
[1:37:44] happening? You're You're doing
[1:37:46] something. Lord, help me not to miss
[1:37:48] you.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Help me not to miss you. And and help me
[1:37:52] start to get excited to see what you're
[1:37:54] going to do.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:58] I want to finish with this this
[1:38:02] scripture.
[1:38:05] Bless the Lord,
[1:38:07] oh my soul, and all that is within me.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless his holy name. Bless the
[1:38:14] Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his
[1:38:18] benefits.
[1:38:19] Don't forget what he's done and what
[1:38:22] he's promised to do.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[1:38:26] healeth all thy diseases, who redeemth
[1:38:29] thy life from destruction, who crowneth
[1:38:31] thee with loving kindness and tender
[1:38:33] mercies, who satisfaith thy mouth with
[1:38:36] good things, so that thy youth is
[1:38:38] renewed like an eagle's.
[1:38:41] How many want to worship that God?
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And worship that way.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're my life. You're my strength.
[1:38:47] You're my strength. You're my song.
[1:38:49] You're everything to me. And you have
[1:38:51] never failed. You're not going to start
[1:38:53] failing today.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; You redeem my life from destruction. You
[1:38:57] crown crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:38:59] and tender. Who satisfied thy mouth with
[1:39:01] good things so that thy youth is renewed
[1:39:03] like an eagles. God is renewing our
[1:39:05] youth. He's taking us back to what we
[1:39:07] were.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] He is the tree that was cut down and
[1:39:11] thrown to the bitterness of life to make
[1:39:13] it sweet again. WHAT'S SWEET ABOUT LIFE?
[1:39:15] CUZ I'm walking WITH A JOYFUL
[1:39:17] EXPECTATION. CUZ I KNOW THIS doesn't
[1:39:19] endure forever. AMEN. THAT THIS LIFE IS
[1:39:21] FOR A PURPOSE and for a season. BUT I
[1:39:23] GOT A HOPE WHICH ENDURETH. And that hope
[1:39:24] could go beyond the veil. I'VE GOT A
[1:39:26] BODY waiting for me beyond this one.
[1:39:28] I've got a promise for a life on this
[1:39:31] earth after this LIFE IS OVER. PRAISE
[1:39:34] GOD. WHAT IS BITTER ABOUT LIFE?
[1:39:37] WE'VE been given life and the hope OF
[1:39:39] LIFE AND THE PROSPECT OF LIFE AND A LIFE
[1:39:41] THAT NEVER ENDS.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; IF THIS TEMPORARY LIFE HAS SOME
[1:39:46] JUNCTIONS IN IT THAT NEED TO PROVE GOD'S
[1:39:48] WORD AND NEED TO MANIFEST Christ in our
[1:39:50] lives in A CERTAIN WAY, THEN SO BE IT.
[1:39:52] I'VE NEVER LOST LIFE AND I'VE NEVER LOST
[1:39:54] ANYTHING, BUT ALL I'VE EVER GOTTEN IN
[1:39:56] THIS WORD IS GAIN, GAIN, GAIN, GAIN,
[1:39:59] GAIN.
[1:40:00] STOP LOOKING AT TODAY AND START LOOKING
[1:40:03] AT THE PROMISE AND TAKE THE WORD AND PUT
[1:40:05] IT BACK ON OUR LIPS AND MAKE THE BITTER
[1:40:08] SWEET AGAIN.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; OH, it's hard to be bitter when you're
[1:40:12] testifying of the word.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; And having a testimony service, it's
[1:40:16] hard to be bitter. All you can say is
[1:40:19] God is good.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He does all things well. He rescued me
[1:40:23] when no one else can. He delivered me.
[1:40:25] Amen. When I needed delivered. He did
[1:40:27] things for me that I didn't even know I
[1:40:29] needed done. I look back and I see a
[1:40:31] provision all the way through. He walked
[1:40:33] me through this wilderness journey and
[1:40:34] he kept me from pitfalls and traps AND
[1:40:36] SLIME PITS. AMEN. AND I THOUGHT MY LIFE
[1:40:38] WAS one disaster of another. And I
[1:40:40] realized IT WAS ALL PERFECT working
[1:40:42] towards his ordained plan to bring me to
[1:40:44] an expected end.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; What do I HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT? WHAT
[1:40:48] DO I HAVE TO BE BITTER ABOUT? I SHOULD
[1:40:50] BE REJOICING BECAUSE HE HAS GUIDED MY
[1:40:52] STEPS. HE HAS PRESERVED MY LIFE. HE HAS
[1:40:54] GIVEN ME ANOTHER DAY TO PRAISE his name
[1:40:56] and he has performed his WORD IN MY LIFE
[1:40:58] FAITHFULLY.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; What should I be bitter about? I should
[1:41:03] rejoice.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:41:07] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[1:41:12] is within me.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I promise if you do that, it's hard to
[1:41:16] be bitter. It
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; is hard to be bitter while rejoicing
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; in the Lord and praising his name with
[1:41:25] all that is within you.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you. That's all I'm going
[1:41:30] to say today. Let's stand.
[1:41:32] Amen. Musicians, if you'll come,
[1:41:37] I say, God, change my language.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Change my attitude towards trials. Just
[1:41:45] change me, God.
[1:41:47] How many believe he's changing you?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; From glory to glory. He's changing us,
[1:41:53] friends. He's growing us into a stature
[1:41:56] of a perfect man into that very life
[1:41:58] that Jesus Christ lived. Jesus had
[1:42:00] bitterness in life. He had
[1:42:02] disappointments. He had rejection. He
[1:42:05] had pain. He had suffering.
[1:42:08] But he knew who his father was. And he
[1:42:10] knew there was a plan for his life. And
[1:42:12] he knew there was an expected end. and
[1:42:14] he kept pressing on. I want to manifest
[1:42:17] that life. God, help me to manifest that
[1:42:21] life, man. Let's just bow our heads for
[1:42:23] a moment.
[1:42:25] Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you for God.
[1:42:29] We could have never made it in life
[1:42:30] without you.
[1:42:32] And those things that look like the
[1:42:34] worst, many times they ended up the
[1:42:37] best.
[1:42:39] And God, we thank you. As we look
[1:42:40] through the word, we see what you've
[1:42:42] always been and what you've always done.
[1:42:45] And you're the same thing today.
[1:42:48] And God, I want to raise my hand and
[1:42:50] say, "Thank you for making my
[1:42:51] bittersweet."
[1:42:53] There was bitterness and trials. There
[1:42:56] was difficulties,
[1:42:57] but I look back on them now and there's
[1:43:00] fond memories of what you did. The
[1:43:02] supernatural, the deliverance. You've
[1:43:05] kept us. You've sustained us. You've
[1:43:07] delivered us.
[1:43:09] And God, you who worked miracles in the
[1:43:11] past, you're just as capable of working
[1:43:13] in them now, in the future, and for
[1:43:16] always.
[1:43:18] God, I pray that you would forgive me
[1:43:20] for speaking bitterness,
[1:43:23] but help me to speak that which is
[1:43:25] sweet,
[1:43:26] to take you, which is the revealed word
[1:43:28] of this hour, and put it on my lips.
[1:43:32] Lord, not the bitterness and the pain,
[1:43:34] but the rejoicing and the truth, the
[1:43:37] word of life, the word made manifest,
[1:43:41] Christ for our day. May we take you and
[1:43:44] put you on our lips and may it be like
[1:43:47] honey on our lips, sweetness. Lord, help
[1:43:51] us to testify, to speak of your
[1:43:54] goodness, of your truth, of your
[1:43:55] righteousness, of your mercy, which
[1:43:57] endureth forever. and help us to keep
[1:43:59] eating, Lord, on this sweet word of
[1:44:01] promise, this truth for our day, this
[1:44:04] revelation of the hour. May we
[1:44:06] continually feed on it. Maybe it's
[1:44:08] sweet. And Lord, though, there must be
[1:44:10] bitter experiences in life. It's part of
[1:44:12] the plan, God. May we never be consumed
[1:44:15] by the bitterness and give in to the
[1:44:16] bitterness, but may we constantly be
[1:44:18] looking for the sweetness to come and
[1:44:20] make every bitter sweet. For you've
[1:44:23] promised it, Lord. You'll do it. We
[1:44:25] believe you. every bitter in life you
[1:44:28] can make sweet.
[1:44:30] We love you, God. We ask for your
[1:44:32] blessings, Lord. May you bless us as a
[1:44:34] people. May we grow. May we understand
[1:44:36] better. May we be illuminated with
[1:44:38] clearer vision. And may we walk in a
[1:44:40] clearer vision. I ask for it in Jesus
[1:44:43] Christ's name.
[1:44:45] Amen.
[1:44:48] Amen. And I tell you friends,
[1:44:51] so many times the sweetness of the trial
[1:44:55] is not the deliverance.
[1:44:59] I know I've preached that so long, but
[1:45:01] sometimes the sweetness of the trial is
[1:45:04] not the deliverance.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Brother V says, "Why does God let trials
[1:45:08] come?"
[1:45:09] He puts bits in their mouth and makes it
[1:45:11] obey them. And those trials bring us
[1:45:14] into a closer fellowship with him.
[1:45:18] Sometimes the sweetness of the trial is
[1:45:21] not the deliverance, but the sweetness
[1:45:23] of the trial is the closer fellowship it
[1:45:26] brings us into with him.
[1:45:30] If we look for him, we'll always find
[1:45:32] him. He's there. Remember, brother told
[1:45:35] the story of the shepherd who broke the
[1:45:37] sheep's leg.
[1:45:39] And somebody questioned him, "Why did
[1:45:40] you break his leg? Were you mad at him?"
[1:45:42] And he said, "No, this sheep kept
[1:45:44] wandering off, and I wanted to break his
[1:45:46] leg so I can show him some special
[1:45:48] attention. Love on him a little bit so I
[1:45:51] can show him how much I love him so
[1:45:52] he'll learn to stay close to me." You
[1:45:54] know, that sheep with a broken leg went
[1:45:56] through some pain. Would you call that
[1:45:58] bitterness?
[1:46:00] But what would you call the special
[1:46:02] attention of the shepherd? A little
[1:46:03] special food carrying him around,
[1:46:05] holding him close to his heart, slinging
[1:46:07] him over his shoulder, what no other
[1:46:08] sheep was getting at the time. I would
[1:46:10] call that sweet. Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; So, was there sweet in the midst of the
[1:46:14] bitter? Was the bitter turned to sweet?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; God lets trials come, puts bits in their
[1:46:21] mouth, makes it obey him, and those
[1:46:23] trials bring us into a closer
[1:46:24] fellowship.
[1:46:26] Listen, sometimes what we're looking
[1:46:28] for, what God's providing is not always
[1:46:30] what we're looking for. Sometimes we're
[1:46:33] looking for the parting of the waters.
[1:46:34] And that's wonderful. And God does that,
[1:46:36] and those are great testimonies.
[1:46:39] But sometimes what he wants to do is
[1:46:41] show you a little extra love and draw
[1:46:43] you up close to him and have a little
[1:46:46] more time in prayer and meditation that
[1:46:50] he can speak back to your heart peace
[1:46:52] and love and sweetness and turn the
[1:46:56] bitter into sweet.
[1:47:00] Not because he parted the waters and the
[1:47:02] the skies open and thunderbolts. No, but
[1:47:06] because he came into the midst of the
[1:47:07] trial and he held your hand a little
[1:47:09] tighter and he put his arm around you
[1:47:12] and consoled you more personally than he
[1:47:15] had the day before.
[1:47:18] Sometimes we look for great big things
[1:47:19] and we miss where Christ is making the
[1:47:22] bittersweet every day.
[1:47:26] Amen. Let let him bring you and I into a
[1:47:31] closer fellowship. Because I tell you
[1:47:33] friends, for the bride, a closer
[1:47:35] fellowship is sweet.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It may take a little bitterness,
[1:47:40] but he'll turn it sweet. Christ is the
[1:47:45] answer. He is the tree. He is the
[1:47:48] special ingredient. He is the thing that
[1:47:51] takes every trial and makes the bitter
[1:47:55] sweet. And I say, "Lord, I appreciate
[1:47:59] the closer fellowship with you. I love
[1:48:03] the special times that you've come to me
[1:48:05] when my heart was broken and I was in
[1:48:08] despair and you come like a dove and
[1:48:10] whispered and could peace into my heart
[1:48:12] and I knew that you were there and that
[1:48:14] you loved me." That turned to
[1:48:17] bittersweet.
[1:48:20] He's always there, friends. He's always
[1:48:24] the tree, the meal offering, the man
[1:48:27] walking on the water. He's always the
[1:48:29] one to turn the bittersweet.
[1:48:32] Look for him.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Watch for him. And every trial, look
[1:48:37] around. Say, God, let me see.
[1:48:39] Is this Are you this peace that's coming
[1:48:42] into my heart now? Is that the
[1:48:43] provision? Is that what you're doing?
[1:48:46] Thank you, Lord. Are you the revelation
[1:48:49] of the word that's become more brighter
[1:48:50] to me through the preaching of the word?
[1:48:52] The answer came. Amen. That's you, the
[1:48:55] meal offering. Watch for him to come.
[1:48:59] He's coming on the scene. Amen. God
[1:49:02] bless you, brother Mike.
