TRANSCRIPT
========================================
When Paul was smitten down to the ground by a pillar of fire and a voice from heaven. Amen. There was other men with him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't alone. &gt;&gt; But I want to read two accounts out of the book of Acts of this. Acts 9 says, "And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man." Then in another place they said, "And they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid, but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me. They heard something but they didn't see a man. And another account they saw a light but they didn't hear the voice. &gt;&gt; That means they were there when Paul had his experience with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they could not understand what Paul understood and they didn't get out of it what Paul got out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. It was individual to Paul, even though they were there when it happened. And they were all struck to the ground, but there was only one who knew that that was Jesus Christ. And there was only one who heard what the voice says. They saw something. They saw a light. They heard something, but they didn't hear the voice of him. Amen. They had an experience when he had an experience, but his experience was special and unique to Paul alone. And he's the only one that saw Christ and heard Christ and understood the message. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter who's with you. Amen. You could sit in the same church service and everybody can hear things and see things and and experience things on a different level, but you can hear preaching and everybody can walk out and they can walk out and say, "Listen, I've had it happen in the foyer. Brother Chad, you don't know that was for me." There was a part there where everything you said was exactly what I was praying about. &gt;&gt; Same service. Somebody else will say, "Brother Chad, that was for me. That's what me and my wife were talking about last night." &gt;&gt; Listen, you compare notes and you say, "This message was for me." You said, "No, it was for me." You say, "Well, this was the best part of the sermon." No, this was the best part of the sermon. They both heard and they saw. Amen. But there was something individual to you. In every service, in every book, in every tape, every time you read your Bible, every time you pray, there's a relationship that's just for you. There's something that's just for you alone. And no matter how much you explain it, other people listen, you may have a prayer request. You may have a desire in your heart. You may have a question that you've been praying about and you shared it with nobody. And all of a sudden, right over the pullpit comes, bang, bang, bang. That's exactly what I was praying about. And you can go out with enthusiasm and tell somebody else and they'll say, "Oh, that's so nice." &gt;&gt; But there's no way they can understand what's happening inside of you, God just spoke to you. God just answered your question. God just gave you exactly what you were looking for. And for you, it's the greatest thing that ever happened. For somebody else, that's exciting. &gt;&gt; I'm happy for you. &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And after you've explained it two or three times, you said, "I'm not going to explain it to nobody else." They just don't get it. &gt;&gt; And the truth is they can't get it. That was you behind the veil. That was God whispering in your ear because it's love secrets to you as an individual. He's whispering the answer back to you. Everybody else heard the same words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to you, it was a personal meeting with you and God.
