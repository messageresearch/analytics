are happy to be here this evening it's always so simple just believe just believe the word and he'll bring it to pass everything he promised he would do God bless you all I would like you to turn in your Bibles directly I sometimes you get out here and I talk a little bit but now I just just kind of want to go to write to the inspiration if that's okay I uh it's been on my mind pretty heavily throughout the day and I'd like to just go to it and I appreciate brother John calling me out a few minutes early gives me a little bit more time on a Wednesday night and and get the kids to bed hopefully for school tomorrow and so I told Brother John brother you don't have to wait long for me as soon as you feel the anointing you think it's time to call me call me I don't care if it's 10 minutes from after you start singing you just when you feel it ready call me so God bless you all we certainly keeping brother Tommy in prayer prayer and brother Matt in prayer here in the prayer requests and trusting God to watch over them both and bring them back here safely soon and obviously um just uh keeping brother Chad in prayer as well he's having a wonderful time him and sister Angie and keep praying for the services to come up this weekend so God bless you okay let's just go right to the word if you don't mind we turn in the Bibles to Romans 85 Romans 85 just say amen amen the word of God says for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen because the carnal mind is enemity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness one more scripture verse I have a PowerPoint so you could just look up from here very simple we all could say this one by heart even the Sunday school kids could but I want to labor on it tonight Mark 12:30 for Thou shalt love the Lord Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord that you gave us these opportunities Lord not that we just get to come to church but Lord we get to come to a believing Church Lord many will go to churches but how many will have the truth and know that you're in their presence father how blessed of a people we truly are Lord to know you're here and to know we are feeding on the body word of Jesus Christ and father that word that we're feeding on is changing us day by day so Lord I just pray that you would come and do only that which you can do take the insufficiency and the inability of an ignorant man Lord and anoint my mind and anoint my lips to just say those things that you'd once said father I pray Lord that you would drive away any evil spirit any doubt any fear any worry any distress Lord those things that Grieve Your Spirit Away father and bring a spirit of peace and a warm welcome in our hearts Lord to receive your word Lord we commit this evening into your hands and I commit the word the things that are said don't let me say anything wrong let me just say what you once said and Lord will you re Bless The Hears the ears that hear the word may we receive it with gladness in Jesus name amen you may be seated this evening so tonight i' like to share something that's been on my mind and uh how many were blessed by Sunday service how many were cut deep amen yeah the word of God knows how to do that it's sharp like a two-edged sword and it knows how to cut in ways we didn't know but we are been cut but if God Cuts he cuts for a purpose and I believe he cuts sometimes so he can bind you up the right way sometimes he's just got to cut off the things that cannot stand to continue to walk with him and I'm just thankful that he knows how to do that and tonight I'd like to take some thought that's been on my mind even before the service that brother Chad had preached something that brother Brenham had said and I have a title obviously as you can see the battle rages all in silence and it's a bit a play on words but I hope it'll make sense as we go on through tonight's service and I do have a lot of quotes and I have a lot of scriptures um but just relax it's a Wednesday night so it'll have your attention something that you can look at tonight but we'll just be feeding on the word I like to start here with what brother banham said in the greatest battle ever fought he said oh we're going to jump to this I had my slides backwards this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angel angs fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and it fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan came to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this and that was his purpose that was his purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on Earth and begin in us and it has been raging ever since when the great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that battle Grand began in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begun and that is because that decisions are made in the mind so last Sunday driving back from Junction City and I love how God works my wife and I were driving not every time do we have the whole family together in a car and could listen to a sermon together and we had about an hour we were leaving Columbus and I just picked one sermon I was thinking well something we can finish it's about an hour long it's the meanest man in Santa Santa Maria Santa Santa Ana something like that and you know in that story brother Brenham talks about the footwash flunky and he talks about the meanest man there who would leave our Lord disrespected and unwelcomed in his own home and it goes so clearly into a drama that I am not one to drama I don't know how to D dramatize anything I'm not good at that but there was something brother B said in there that just stopped me when he said it he starts to talk about the agony that this woman is going through could she do it how could she do it he would know where I got the money oh I can't do it but I can't let him sit there unwelcomed he can't he can't do it he's my Lord but I can't go do this if I do this I sell everything I have you know a great battle was raging in the mind of this woman and brother brandham goes on to say as she was wrestling this out in her mind she eventually commits herself to it buys the alabaster box goes to his feet breaks it tears can't look can't move just starts dumping it crying pouring it all out kissing his feet and washing it with his hair and brother banon made the comment that the Lord did not move or make a sound if he would have moved if he would have even just barely moved she would have taken off and I got to thinking about that as I was driving home and I even called brother Chad this week after he preached watering the cels camels I said you know I was listening to meanest man and when she was breaking that Alabaster Box the Lord was standing in silence complete silence not going to make a move going to see what she would do and I began to think in my mind as she was there you know nobody told her to go do that he wasn't asking her to do it she didn't have uh the disciples off to the side saying you need to do the Lord a service oh will you go do this oh do you know if you do this he'll forgive your sins she had none of that she had a battle in her mind what would she do and I'm so convinced that this brings it right up to present tense I stepped into her shoes what would you do would you sell all and give him a service like that and I began to think about oh my goodness you know we are all in the same position right now she believed that he was her Lord he said oh my Lord is sitting there with unwashed feet so in her Mar in her heart her mind she believed him to be Lord she even had a desire to do something for him she even had in her heart faith right she believed in her soul there was a faith to believe this is the master but now she was going to have to do something with all her strength that would go bypassing all aspects of understanding in her human mind she was going to do something radical unbelievable she was going to give everything she had and serve the Lord amen and I as I've been doing on that love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all your strength amen many people will give him their mind yes and God will use what you give him you give him your mind you want to know more about God and the mysteries of God you know what God will give it to you yes some people want to just believe God from their soul you know brother bham said there's two Senses at work in the soul two senses only faith and unbelief but you know you can move mountains and still go to hell though I have all faith that I could move mountains and did not Jesus say though they did many mighty works we did many mighty works in your name did not we lay hands on the sick and they recovered did not we do this didn't we do that they had Faith they wouldn't do it without it he said depart from from you workers of iniquity I don't know you and then some people have a desire to serve God but they give him none of their strength they give their strength to pursue careers they give their strength to pursue whatever desire they have and God's not going to force you to do anything you make your own decisions you make your own choice whether or not you will give him all yes that's your choice because remember God wants to be loved and you cannot force that one he can create every circumstance he can he can reveal himself to you his heart's been revealed to you all that he is has been revealed to you but then now your time to make a decision the Bible says now I'm going to break these down and we're going to slide through these in Psalms 37 Delight thyself also in the Lord and He will give Thee the desires of thy heart so from your heart comes your desires Paul said in Romans Brethren my heart's desire My heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that you might be saved one thing have I desired that I would seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord the Rapture brother brandham said so we know that desires come from the heart and how many of you have a desire for God praise God that you do because what would you do without that and who put it there but you know what you can have a desire for God and that's still not everything you can give him your desires but that may not be enough in fact I know it's not cuz the Lord G told told you his will I want all amen you can give him your whole soul you can believe brother banham said you know the woman on the front row it's like the message now I believe she's a Christian woman she make me a fine woman if I made made her a wife but she's not mine until I take her and make her mine it's like with the Bible you can believe the Bible you can believe God you can believe that he can raise the dead he can move mountains he can bless you he can solve your problems and he will this is what's so amazing did not we do many mighty Works did not we lay hands on the sick did not we even move mountains yeah he answered their prayers they had Faith but that wasn't enough I hope you're understand where I'm going I'm just it's just been on my heart you know many men uh can be used of God to do many wonderful things for the kingdom of God many mighty preachers and we could name many of them through the through the last hundred years or even W especially in the last couple hundred years or the last hundred years Mighty miracles in their Ministry and nobody could deny it and then stand look at the word and deny the word do Mighty Miracles and if that's all you want to do for God God will bless you in doing it but that's still not all what he was looking for yes remember there's a secret mystery desire that he had in his heart but he can't force this one can't force this one now he says now look what is faith faith is a six sense five senses control this man God put man in five senses to contact his Earthly H home you don't contact god with your five senses you know God by faith which is the six sense which is the two senses of of the Soul Faith or unbelief and if you're possessed with faith then faith is just as real is such a reality to you but then bringing into view Matthew 7 many will say in that day Lord Lord have not I prophesied in thy name have not I cast out devils in thy name have not I done many wondrous Works in thy name and I will profess to them I never knew you depart from me you worker of iniquity why wow it's tough amazing from the soul you could have faith in God and still be departed you could still depart and you understand with what I'm saying here you could take this the wrong way but I'm I'm saying this for this portion he said love the Lord thy God with all your mind now you know and I know there is a battle for your attention like there never was before and don't you dare think that you don't have a real battle going on every day because you know you do never in any other age has the human mind been bombarded with information and opportunities and to satisfy the desires of your heart and you know why people are losing their minds it's what they're feeding on all day long because the Bible says he that keepeth uh he keepeth thee at perfect peace who's what mind is stayed on thee so maybe you've given God your desire your heart's desire I want to serve God maybe in your heart you believe him you believe his word but you don't give him your mind he said all your mind what you think about what you're doing how you're entertaining your mind the Bible brother bam said the Holy Ghost is entertained by the word not the world and you know people are losing their minds because they've taken their minds off of the word of God yes now bringing this up into view to show you the battle brother bam says well that's the way it is friend Satan tries to be a hypocrite he tries to show you something better an easier way a more sensible plan but there is no more sensible plan than that God laid at the beginning his word hold that word get a grip on it and let it get a grip on you dropping down the battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to reasoning that's the flu it came in that's the channel it run down her reasoning see in her soul she reasoned her eyes was sight she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome and far better than her husband and I was bringing this up with a brother the other day I says you know what's so interesting to me there was a battle raging in her mind she saw this great big beautiful creature that was telling her things and it sounded amazing and then she could think back to her husband simple humble husband Adam and you begin to think about what was raging on today in our minds you look at the things of the world brother bam said sin is twice as pleasurable sin is pleasurable for a season but it brings death and I said you you know what every time you look at your phone every time there's something there your body releases a chemical called dopamine yes and you get a thrill out of it you do every one of you do that's why you get nervous when you can't find your phone you're addicted to it yes and your body craves it and every time you look at that phone every time you see a screen or an image flash body releases dopamine dopamine dopamine dopamine it's a pleasure you're getting great pleasure from it and you're you're constantly looking to satisfy that car pleasure yes and people are losing their minds because of this now I understand there's sometimes chemical imbalances but I fully believe with all my heart people have taken their eyes off the word of God and off the message and they keep put looking at the wrong things they're feeding off those evil spirits and they're losing their minds left and right people nervous anxious can't be settled down for nothing running here running there always upset about something why don't you pray why don't you stop looking at that rotten phone and pray why don't you read your Bible I asked the kids this last week I said how many have spent a half hour in prayer I'll ask the adults how many have spent a half hour in prayer should be all of us brother and you know it you were that busy I'm guilty too I'm guilty but I have to be honest even if it cuts me to my very core I'll be honest and I can't get away from what's on my heart I cannot do it the battle's Raging and guess what everybody you're not as Victorious as you may like to put on for all of us we're all great Christians I told the youth you're all greatl looking Christians when you're a part of a group you look good you talk right you look right you act right you sing the right songs and you stay in tune you look engaged when we're all together but what about when you're all alone and you get to make your own choice today what you're going to look at what you're going to do what you're going to pursue where you're going to give your strength where you're going to give your mind where you're going to give the heart's desires to where you at everyone we say we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we say we are doesn't the Bride of Jesus Christ have him only as his desire isn't he only the thing they give their strength to isn't he there everything or supposed to be everything not part I'm guilty many times I've given part of my strength part of my life and I haven't given him all of my life because there's too much self in me the last day spirit that we all must be guarding against brother Bram said was this I want to give you a warning it says concerning the last days that because CA of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the lead in or last age self-love and the love of material things carnally minded will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit have you felt the effects of this last day Spirit do you find yourself concerned worried anxious what's going on with politics what's going on with the economy I probably should make more money I probably should get a better job I probably should improve this and I probably should improve that uhoh you're talking like the rest of the world talks that's how unbelievers speak take no thought for what you shall eat or your rainment he does take care of the birds in the air how much more will he take care of you see amen that's not always your response and you know it hasn't always been my response and I know it it's because I have been affected by this Endtime Spirit self-love preserve self love for material things I was telling the kids you think about this everyone go back a 100 or 200 years ago how many opportunities did a 13 14 year old boy have 200 years ago if his daddy's farming guess what he's doing every day he's farming if daddy's a blacksmith guess what that boy's doing every day he's a blacksmith if Daddy says we're working 14 hours a day the boy's working 14 hours a day no nothing going to change now look at where you stand right now in the very center of Satan's Eden every opportunity to do all almost whatever you want to do is available for you you can pursue any heart's desire that you truly have you can go anywhere that you really want to go you can entertain yourself with almost anything you want at all times you telling me that this isn't Satan's Eden wow and we got to guard against it yes sir because it's having an effect and it will cool us all off we can't just come here and shout and praise God and say hey woohoo I'm the bride and then get just going down the stream of life with everybody else my goodness you better fight against that thing you have to fight that's why I said the battle's Raging guess what suit up get ready your mind's being attacked constantly your flesh is under attack constantly look at the amount of fear that's in the system right now you not you you know and I know what's happening to America it doesn't take much to look around look like things are getting worse a lot worse really fast you know it and I know it you see the cost of goods going up you see the situation and uncertainty of everything around you what do you do you leave you run and get a better job you buy a gun I'm just telling you these are the things the carnal mind instantly go to and don't act like you haven't thought those things maybe we should diversify and buy gold rather than the dollar the Dollar's collapsing milk $16 a gallon what are you going to do have I saved up enough for retirement am I working maybe I should get two jobs oo man it's having an effect you too quiet you all is too quiet maybe it's just me maybe it's just me all thy mind I'll labor on this for a moment 2 Corinthians says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ are you fighting a good fight there when doubt worry concern and fear come are you grabbing it two hands saying nope that didn't come from God and I'm not even going to entertain it I'm not going to allow that thought to stay in my mind and create fear and cause me to compromise on my purpose in this life your purpose is to not make a bunch of money and relax and make life as comfortable as possible do you know that the American culture says pursue pursue pursue get more get more get more and get everything you can and make every problem you have or every difficult thing that you go through go away do you think that's God's way no no but he's going to let you make a choice he lets us all make choices what will we do when he stands silent and he doesn't tell you to do anything and nobody else tells you to do anything what do you do we've entered into an interesting phase for the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe I believe now it's her turn to respond am I think it's now he showed us his word his life and his desires now he must stand silent and see what she will do Solomon gave all his mind to God didn't he he said Lord I need wisdom to rule your people and he was A Gifted Man a word of discernment brother bham said wisdom like no other man that had been on the earth outside of Jesus Christ no one was like Solomon and what did he do with that great gift he pursued and did everything he wanted to do he says in Ecclesiastes the words of the preacher the son of David King of Jerusalem vanity of vanity saith the preacher vanity of vanity all is Vanity what profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh Under the Sun I made me great works I builded me houses I planted me Vineyards and I made me Gardens of orchards I planted trees in them of all kinds of of fruits I made me pools of water to water there in the wood that bringeth forth trees I got me servants I got me maids I had servants born in the house also I had great possessions of Great and Small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me I gathered me also silver gold precious Treasures of the kings of the provinces I got me men singers women singers and the Delights of the sons of men musical instruments of All Sorts he had it all everybody and you know what he said all is what vanity so I was great increased more and all that than all that were before me in Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me God never removed it his gift and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them I withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labor and this was my portion of all my labor then I looked on all the works that my hand had wrought and on the labor that I had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of my spirit and there was no Prophet Under the Sun here is an example of a man who gave God all his mind but what happened in the end did he give all God's all his heart to God no First Kings 11:4 for it came to pass when Solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart from other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord for Lord his God and his heart and as was the heart of David for Solomon went unto astroth the goddess of the zidian and under Malin the abomination of the amorites and Solomon did evil in the sight of God and went not fully after the Lord H gave his mind just not his heart heart wouldn't give it all Colossians says if ye be risen with Christ seek those things that are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above and not on things of the Earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concubus and covetousness which is idolatry what happened to Solomon covetousness his eyes were never satisfied he wanted everything he desired he was never satisfied and he went to what idolatry H Isaiah says he keepeth thee at perfect peace whose mind is stayed in thee because he trusteth in thee there is a promise that God will bring up peace if you just make him first in your mind you don't have to be stressed out and trying to figure out how to solve life's problems and how you're going to fix this and how you're going to fix that and what if this happens and what if that happens you know what you'll be in a a nervous wreck anxious never settled upset all the time if you live that way you keep trying to solve your problems and you'll make them worse but he promised you just seek me first you just keep me on your mind watch what will happen this is simple y'all's know this is truth right you set your affections on things above you keep him on your mind and stop worrying about everything going on around you we're Believers we don't worry we don't have fear we have faith that God will take care of his own he says be careful for nothing but in everything through prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise at all think on those things you're commanded by God to not even think think of the things that aren't truthful or the things that aren't Pure or the things that are not of a good report how many tune into the news to get good reports when's the last time you're like I got to see some good news from Fox CNN they got some good news for me they got good reports you know we're not supposed to do that I'm okay with you know kind of understand a little bit of what's going on but we're not supposed to be entertaining our minds with that nonsense all the time you wonder why men's hearts are failing them for fear they're feeding off of those fearful evil spirits constantly creating unbelief in their hearts and then their minds are breaking they don't think about the right things they're always thinking about the problems they're always thinking about the situations that around them they can't figure out and they don't know what to do and they wish someone would fix them and then they lose their minds nervous wonder what's going on you're not thinking on those things that are pure honest and of a good report you know that Samson gave all his strength to God but he wouldn't give his heart God is only trying to find one person he can get in his hands he has always tried to do that you notice all down through the Bible when we find we found an Isaiah when we found a Jeremiah then we found a Samson one day but Samson gave his strength to God but he gave his heart to Delilah see you've got to give your all to God your reverence your respects your everything that you are just be nothing just see how little you are and that's what God wants us to do God's not looking for you to do anything great and big in the eyes of the world did you know that I have struggled with that my whole life I've told the kids I've had a okay you know brother brother Chad said the other day he said you know what a pastor told him he struggled with something it wasn't until he confessed it that it broke I told the kids and brother Gabe was there too I said my whole life I have never felt that I had anything to offer I have struggled with that complex very much I thought there was no value to me and you know what I did from a complex I went out to try to prove my value to this world I have had success in business and I went out and I would buy houses and you know what with every one of those houses I felt a little better about myself because there was an Evidence of my value and it was all in vain right yes yes and it meant nothing because I was already valued I was already a son what more value do I need what more do I need in this natural life than to see the grace of God come my way and reveal to me that I'm a part of him you're a part of him what do you have to prove from this point on you're a son or a daughter of almighty God there's nothing to prove to anybody but often times we do things out of our own complexes we try to cover we don't want the pain of letting a complex be dealt with often times we all do this in our own ways and guess what you all have complexes and don't you act like you don't if you believe the message of God and the prophet of God he said we all got them and we all got them I got them too and it's been one of those things I've fought with my whole life and God in his Mercy I believe will help me I believe he's helping me even now but there's no value in pursuing those things what good is it to give my strength to pursue something that burns why not give my strength to something that'll last for all eternity but it's a choice I have to make he's not going to back me into a corner corner and he ain't going to back you into a corner you know that I talked to the chapel kids last couple weeks ago I don't know these services are running together I was telling them I was I I brought three little crosses a little cross a medium cross and a great big cross to the Chapel at the school each one of them I wrote down his will was up and down and our will across and I wrote on that cross what that cross represent shame humility despisement pain everything negative is on that cross and you know what I held each one of them up and I brought different kids up one were little kids some big kids I put the big kid with the little cross I said that's not your cross then I brought uh vice versa a little kid with a big cross is that that's not your cross and then eventually we found someone for each cross I said ah see that's your cross right but there was one last cross there it was great big 6' 4 I said now this is a big cross this is a big burden I can't even bear this cross I said this is a cross for someone that can carry it and I can't carry that burden it's for somebody else I said I don't know who it would be for it looks horrible it's painful it's despising it's ridicule it's alone it's miserable cross but I can't force anybody body to carry this cross and neither will God and one person stands up and it's brother rra brother Rap by his own free will got up out of his seat walked over to that cross and it was just for him but that's the reality I told the kids you know what we've come to the point God didn't back us into a corner and force us on a cross of suffering now we make our own choice to suffer for Christ often times we really do you honestly in your heart you want God to do everything for you you want him to perfect you he you want him to fix everything in your life Lord get me in the condition for the Rapture sake you know you got to make some choices you know he learned obedience through much suffering and you will do the same but I believe the majority of suffering to come for you now is of your own choosing you chose a harder way your self and God didn't back you into a corner to do it when she went and broke that Alabaster Box nobody told her to do it nobody said you know what it's okay you get rid of all your money this is what you've saved up for it's your only path to get out of this life of mess if you'll do it I'm sure God Will Make A Way he'll bless you he'll save you and then he'll give you a a whole bunch of money so you can get out of this life she didn't know what she was going to do she was stuck she hadn't a clue what was going to happen she just knew I want to do something for him I believe him I believe he's the Lord I have a heart's desire desire to do something for him I can't get him out of my mind I know people will think I'm crazy for what I'm about to do and then she went and did it and nobody forced her to do it he didn't even say anything to her he just stood there silent God's doing great big things in silence gaining preeminence not taking it not taking it you're giving it amen amen it was all now in silence I began to think also the woman when Elijah came to a widow woman think of the situation there's a drought there's judgment in the land how many know America's under judgment 100% you can't stop it under judgment the land's under judgment Elijah said it's not going to rain for three and a half years until I call for it well he didn't say three and half years he's not going to rain till I call for it so there's a drought there's nothing to eat people are starving to death this is a difficult situation none of us have been in that situation before she's walking to get two little sticks so that she can make a little fire bake a little cake and die Elijah comes to her and it says bake me a cake first you imagine the battle she had for a moment in her mind I don't think it was okay sure no problem yep okay let me go make you that and yeah I know you'll you'll you'll I don't think it was instantaneous the scripture you just read on through it I think he might have waited in silence for a moment let the battle rage in her mind what I will surely die if I do what you're asking me to do it's amazing but she did it she went and had so much faith in what this man was saying that what he was saying bake me the cake first the the barrel shall never run empty and the barrel shall never run dry and the creu shall never run empty she did it she believed him she gave all and God preserved her life through the midst of that drought and that judgment amen and it's just interesting that we've come back to these same situations brother bham this was the quote that jumped out to me last Sunday as she was try and as she was trying to say something and and couldn't the tears were just running off his off of his feet she didn't have any water to wash his feet with the Pharisees hadn't given her no water but what beautiful water he had tears of repentance washing Jesus's dirty feet oh God tears of repentance washing Jesus's Dirty Feet she'd washed them and then she' kissed them and washed them and she she broke the top off the little box and she p the ointment on there and she looked up now if he had moved she'd had gotten out of there in a minute but he just if she wanted to do him a service he just set still and let her do it I love that if you want to do him service he will set still and let you go ahead undo it I believe God's sitting still now I believe now we've come to the plan part of the story he's done what he needed to do now she must do what she must do to show who she really is on the inside we may not be much to look at on the outside and I promise you I sure am not neither was this woman prostitute nothing on the outside that we could say was good about her but on the inside what happened she loved the Lord with all her heart with all her soul with all her mind and now with all her strength amen she did she gave everything to him she expressed how much he meant to her and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in the barrel and a little oil in the Cru and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that I may eat it and die and Elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me therefore a little cake first and bring it unto me and make and after make thee thee and for thy son my God sometimes just creates a situation for you to make a choice I've been in a min of times and I've made the wrong choice many of times but may God help us all to start making him the only choice we're worth living for at this point we're going to have to come to that point he's not going to force you to do it anymore he's going to sit there silent and still watch what you will do will you take that job that takes you away from church it's a career choice it's a better paying job but it'll take you out of Fellowship ship right will you pursue that one activity you really love I mean it's your passion in life but my it's taking up all your time you have no time to prayer anymore like will you continue to try to stay in fellowship with everybody and you're socially connected to everyone in the church and you don't even know the last time you went into deep prayer for somebody connected to everybody else and not connected with God let me ask you what do you think he wants amen but he's not going to back you in a corner anymore when I was a child you all know this When We Were Young when you're children your parents watch over you and do everything for you right you start to take your first steps there's a mom or a dad there holding both hands don't want him to get hurt don't want him to go the wrong way let me hold his hands right he gets a little older Mom and Dad they don't completely abandon the child they watch him they're pretty close they're not make sure he don't fall down the stairs or something like that but they stay pretty close but they're letting him make a little bit more making a little Freedom Little Steps little more of a steps that he wants to make but as that parent or that child grows older what does the parent do let's go make your own choice it's your time to decide if you want to go that way you can go that way I have nothing more to say I'm now silent the parents can't tell the children what to do anymore you have no right you actually just have to sit back and trust God from this point and God's doing that with us he's raising mature Sons and Daughters of God Amen active and involved when you started off with the Lord you notice that each of us I do when I first started walking the Lord I showed up here 15 years 14 years ago I don't even know but he was so actively involved in every decision I felt like oh yeah he don't want me to do that oh I better do this and oh yep and and then as time goes on it's interesting I realize I can start making this choices and I don't exactly always know what he wants and sometimes he even blesses decisions that I kind of question whether or not I should do that that's what will really throw you for a loot you kind of do something you weren't quite sure he wanted you to do it but it made a lot of sense in doing it so you did it anyhow and then God blesses you in doing it but all the while there's that question mark you never did this in faith you never had a true faith that that's what God wanted you to do but God still blessed you in doing it I'm telling you you believe this is true you you you believe this is what's going on you could testify in your own life you've had those kind of things happen in your own life little decisions you've made you weren't quite sure and you're pretty confident you could be honest now and say that wasn't the right decision and yet God still blessed me in doing it why did he do that maybe he always wants me to just go and do the things that I want to do no but he's not going to come out and tell you right away he'll let you make your choice Moses by faith when he was come to years refused to be called the son of daugh of of Pharaoh's daughter choosing What Choosing rather to suffer Affliction with God's people the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a SE season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward God never forced Moses to suffer Moses made his choice to suffer for Christ's sake God's not going to make you suffer for his sake you're going to make your own choice to suffer for Christ's sake you okay I little more brother brandom we all know brother brandom had a complex don't we I love the fact that he was not afraid to show us his weak spots he stayed a man when I was a little boy I wasn't loved and nobody cared for me when I was a kid and I when I found out found somebody that loved me I thought I I want to die for them and now because somebody loves me somebody cares I was climbing one time on a post and my hook slipped out on a old cedar post and the knot was up high and I hit it with my spur and it turned me around I fell about 15 ft and I caught it caught on my arm and a lady screamed and she kind of patted herself like that I always like that lady she cared she was somebody who cared and I always thought anybody who cared for me I love them brother Branham wasn't loved as a kid he loved people and people didn't love him he was a brandom he had a bad name bad reputation and nobody loved brother brandham but he loved people and now what happens when he comes and he starts making his own decisions in the ministry do people come to him and offer him Fellowship big fellowship and love if he'll just compromise a little on the word of God did not the angel Lord tell him you'll lose thousands of your friends if you preach these things right so brother Branham had a a complex his whole life he wanted to be loved but he had to be willing to be rejected to serve God completely and utterly rejected to stay with the word man that was his weak spot everyone remember the story remember the picture of brother Bram was standing by Oral Roberts and he's up on his tippy toes yeah had a complex felt inferior wanted to be loved wanted to be liked so he had some choices to make and because thou has chosen the Narrow Path and the harder way thou Hast walked in thine own choosing thou Hast picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision thou Hast made this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine it was all expressed when someone chose the harder way he showed us he gave us an example of what divine love really was all about Divine love makes a choice of your own choosing no one told him to do it he didn't feel a pressure he didn't feel God would bless him more or God would love him less he made his own choice he made a choice for a harder way a harder life I mean he tore up a million dollars I think twice if I remember this right how many of you going to tear up a million dollars he did he chose a harder life a life of suffering his whole life because there was only one thing he loved more than everything and that was God and he just wanted to serve him and he didn't want anything to get in the way or distract him from that purpose so he ripped it up so he goes over and gets a little garbage pale this is the story of zakus when he climbed up the tree wanted to see Jesus goes over garbage pale picks it up over and sets it down Shin shinys up the tree you know gets up there and he found where two limbs come together so he could make him a good seat and sit down that's a good place to sit down and think it all over brother where two ways meet yours and God's and think it over sitting there on a limb that's what that cross represents decision time choices to be made and you will always suffer if you choose the harder way but remember that's his way his way is not the easier way his way is the harder way and I've said this before I know I said it to the kids you get to the point you don't know what you said to who but nonetheless you know if there's a cross and you know you're supposed to be carrying one every day and you can't find it you don't know what decision you're making consciously to suffer for Christ's sake you're probably on the the wrong path that's right there's a cross for everyone there's a cross for you and if you can't find it brother you're probably too far up the path of your own choosing to even see the cross was way back there so it may cause you to have to turn around make some things right go back the other way find that thing that you didn't want to deny yourself in doing or pursuing and pick it up and carry it for Christ's sake because you're never removing a cross from Christianity don't you ever think that the Bride of Jesus Christ has a flowery bed of ease and she doesn't have to suffer anything for Christ's sake she does she suffers of her own choosing and when I look at the cross I can see something better I think of the ransom cross that God Almighty Out of Heaven who saved my soul and I think that on that cross and emblem of suffering and shame it has always been that it will always be that but it's a great Victory because he chose it for you you know nobody put him on the cross nobody the Bible says no man took his life from him he gave his life for you he gave it nobody took it now if you're cut out of the same cloth that Jesus Christ is do you think you'll be giving yourself over to a cross or someone's going to have to force you on it I think with all my heart the same life the same character the brightest bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she'll make the same decision he makes she'll gladly lay down her life her desires and all her strength think of this young young man I've been thinking about the Rich Young Ruler for months months he was a good boy everyone really a good boy I mean we would look at him and think he's the model Christian model I mean respectful honors always 30 minutes early to church always never misses respectful to his parents honored them loved them cared for them model but there was one thing he could not give up and that was the one thing that separated him from eternal life just one thing what a sad situation he went away sad cuz there was something in him he just loved more than God and that's all it took he was like 99% good everyone but there was just one thing he couldn't let go of and God wasn't going to pry it out of his hands many times s he'll let you hold it and hold it and hold it waiting for you to drop it and take up a cross and follow him you know you can't carry a cross and your own desires at the same time you just can't do it it's one or the other you cannot serve God ad in Mammon you cannot care about the things of this world and care about doing the will of God in the same breath you can't do it but I'm afraid at many times we want both both and many times we want maybe we we believe it right we believe it and many times we have a desire to be his bride but we won't give our strength to it we give him leftovers we give him part of our Lives yes you know I would imagine every old person in here if they had the opportunity to change bodies with the youth you would do it in a heartbeat wouldn't you you would do that that's not even without a question right you would be so happy to have a renewed strength like that what would you do with it older people what would you do with that would you say man I'd have really pursued that dream of mine I always had I was I just or would you say no if I could do it all over again I'd have put him first I really would have put him first I'd have stopped caring about all the things of this world that cares this world that cares of Life pride of life if I could do it over my goodness how many older people over 50 40 me included 40 there we go we're old how many old you if you could do it again if you could trade back places with a young body you wouldn't take that young body and use it to pursue some carnal thing that's right I hope that's your testimony if you could do it over again you'd say if I had it all over again I'd give him my best I wouldn't wait till there's nothing else I could do I'd give him my best when I had the opportunity to do it I believe that's what God wants he wants your best he wants everything he's not going to force you you make your choice I asked my wife cuz I have been considering this where's my cross I asked my wife and my girls to think about this about a month ago I said girls where's your cross write it down I want to see it it's a good exercise go home go home you're all alone next time you're in prayer write down on a piece of paper where you know you're picking up a cross for the kingdom of God's sake you're carrying a cross not for yourself you're carrying it for someone else find it there's a cross for everyone if you can't find it better go backwards too far up the road of your desire got to go back to his desire and find where it was and it's something I've looked at because he said Jesus said unto his disciple If any man shall come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me so something that you're going to be denying yourself is probably really close to where your cross is something that you tell yourself no I'm going I want to do this but I'm not going to do this I'm going to cake up a cross I promise you your cross is really close to your desire really close something you're going to have to deny yourself something you may even love something you may even be really good at for whosoever will lose his life or will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it that word deny is simply to forget oneself and lose sight of oneself or one's own interests remember what Spirit we must guard against in this day the spirit of self-love do what I want to do pursue what I want to pursue go where I want to go think about the things I want to think about entertain myself with the things that I want to entertain myself with I'm going to have to deny that for his sake Philippians 3:7 but what things were gained unto me those I counted loss for Christ another example Paul the Apostle yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and I count them but dung that I may win Christ it's dung every bit of this world is dumb every good thing the world will tell you to pursue is filth it's dung compared to Christ and pursuing Christ and living your life for those Eternal things just living your life for him and for others that is what is going to last and Paul had that before him at all times right having not apprehended yet I press toward that Mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus I haven't yet grabbed it guys but I'm pressing towards that that God would get me to the point in this life where I can look at everything that this world could give me in its best and say it's D let me suffer the reproach of Christ let me take my way with the Lord's despised VI you okay you all believe this it's okay A couple of y'all can say amen I I it's okay sister Maria you can even say Amen it's fine love love you God bless you no but nonetheless if you believe it you just take a hold of it remember I'm not ask you don't have to remember it all you don't have to be able to line it all up but if it's striking your heart you know it's a truth just believe it you receive the word the word itself will come to pass you just have to believe it remember only believe that's why I wanted to sing that song cuz I knew this might cut it cut me it's been cutting me and I I I just know that's what my desire is now God you're going to have to bring it to pass in my life I'm trying and I'm failing I'm trying and I'm failing and it's my heart's desire but God you're going to have to do this in me I can't do it but the seed itself can the only thing I know to do is believe it say Amen agree with it say Lord bring it to pass in my life let me overcome me my greatest of enemies I don't know why this came to my mind I yesterday I got to thinking right before I went to bed of a wedding a vow two women or no sorry the day and age we live in sadly a man and a woman making a vow one to another and immediately got to thinking of Christ and it says this is Brother Branham taken from a wedding will you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to live together in in this holy state of of matrimony do you promise to love honor cherish in sickness and health in riches or in poverty and will forsake all others and cleave thee only unto her as long as you both would live and the groom answers I will immediately that's what he's told you the man speaks first he went first and he said I'll take care of you I love you I want you more than anything in this world I gave my life for you I've changed circumstances to reveal myself to you I've unveiled who I really am but now the man has to stand silent because now it's her turn to speak will you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband to live together in this holy matrimony do you promise to love to honor to cherish in sickness and in health in riches or in poverty and will forsake all others and cleave only unto him as long as you both shall live and the bride answers and the bride answers the bride answered I will you'll leave everything you will forsake all and cleave to him he spoke first now it's your turn so God wants you to love him with all your heart with all your soul all your mind and all your strength brother Brenham said this in the token but now the life that was in the blood becomes the token and now when we identify ourselves in his death burial and Resurrection by believing on him and being baptized unto his death burial and Resurrection when we rise up the holy spirit is there to give us a token an eternal token written across our heart soul makeup Mind Body everything else that you are separated person from unbelief you're a separated person from the things of the world you're a separated from Death you're separated from everything and you are a product that God has sealed into the kingdom by his holy spirit when the Holy Spirit comes into your life it doesn't just cause you to believe the word it causes you to believe the word to it cleanses your mind it gives you the right heart's desire and it puts you in action to serve God in his purpose in everything that you do from that point on and if that's not there stirring you and burning within you you may need a bit of a refilling and a bit of a stirring within your heart you may need to go back to the source of strength where you once was so excited for God and now the world cooled you off but you don't have to stay that way you know that right I don't believe sermons like this keep coming brother Ben doesn't preach on selfishness brother Gabe brother Emanuel brother Chad I don't think God's just doing that to just say things I think God's literally call he's like man how much more clear do I have to tell them if they only knew what was behind that little cross if they only knew that everything they truly desire is behind that cross that's the Mirage that's the that's the false thing the world tells you peace and joy and all of the things that you you know you want is behind pursuing your own will but actually true peace true Joy true satisfaction is all in the cross it's all right behind it it's hiding there and as soon as you take it you'll find him a true joy that a joy it's not based on circumstances anymore you could have Troy in the midst of all the trials and your whole life falling apart and you've got true joy and a true peace because our peace is not circumstances our peace is a person Jesus Christ Joy is a person salvation is a person it's not a set of circumstances that we find ourselves in so many people unless everything's working out just right and everybody's acting right they've lost all joy what happened they have no peace things aren't going the way they thought it would go what ought not be for the bride ought not be so we're going to wrap it up Mark 1230 and thou shalt love the Lord thy God just remember it and now think about it so many times we've cruised over this scripture verse there's many elements to what this is meaning but I'll tell you one thing that compasses all of it it's all of you it's all your desires it's all your faith it's all your mind and it's all your strength the things that you give yourself to it's all of it and in fact he wants all of it or none of it remember Rich Young Ruler gave him 99% gave him the majority just didn't give him all Luke 17 20 and when he's demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or loow there for the kingdom of God is within you don't forget the mystery of his coming he's looking for a woman that will gladly forsake all and embrace him alone he's going to come in you but you must be willing for him to actually be manifested in your life CU he's a perfect gentleman and he don't force himself on nobody it's amazing to think that we could go through life we could serve God we could go to church we could say Amen we could believe the word and realize you know down deep in your heart you're still not giving them all it's amazing we could come year after year after year Time After Time After Time we dress the right way we talk the right way we sing at the right songs we agree with the right word and yet you know in your heart you're still not giving him you're all you entertain yourself with the things of the world and the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's Not in you it's just not there but we have a sticky cber nature and the battle is Raging right now it's still ongoing and we all got something to do but remember he's not going to force this time this is the time where the bride now says I will I'm not M you're not making me do it I'm doing this of my own free will how do you think brother Brandon could get to the point where he said even if he sends me to hell that's right I will would still serve him yes sir because he loved him and love is a choice amen God wasn't going to force him he would still serve God and give him his all even if he sent him to hell that's right have we came there yet because Divine love makes that choice I intentionally knew that I would stop a little early um wanting to give this last little time if it's all right to prayer I am very concerned for myself and others that we know that we're losing uh a battle to a degree at times because we just don't pray what do you get in the carnal by praying nothing you have to sacrifice your time your energy when you could be out doing something productive and you know what you do you make a sacrifice and you give that time to God and how often times we just don't make any sacrifice anymore we just don't we do our devotions because we want to check it off our little mental list of things we needed to do today we pray before our dinner our lunch we say Lord please bless this food on my body thank you so much that don't count God wants communion God wants Fellowship we can go to church too much you can read your Bible too much you cannot pray enough you can't pray too much you cannot take and show God that you're sacrificing your life showing him that he means more to you than you mean to you and God wants to see that I believe with all my heart I don't believe he wants to have to put you on your back with sickness or troubles or situations to get you to finally pray it's sad but that's the most time when we pray is when life's not going the way I wanted it to go and when it gets so bad then you realize Lord I got to call you on the scene and you know what he will and he'll solve the problem he'll heal your body he'll raise you up and then you go right on off into doing what you want to do all the time I don't believe this is a club everybody I don't believe this is a lodge I don't believe we're doing this for fun I ain't coming here for fun I ain't coming here just because I like the fellowship I'm coming here to get cut judged searched my heart I'm coming here to be molded and shaped into his very image CU that is my heart's desire and I fail him so very much but my absolute desire and I know it's my desire is to be just like him to be a bride that he'd be pleased with that one he would say oh I love her I love her and I know she loves me I know it I know it because she was willing to give up everything to be with me why don't you stand musicians come got 15 minutes before 9 and if you don't mind musicians maybe you just play something softly when you come up but I asked the kids I said you know a really good way to know where you're at when you pray how do you pray if you when you go to prayer you're always praying for God to do something for you I have a question then who is serving who does God exist to serve you or are you living to serve him because brother bham said prayer is getting yourself out of the way stop thinking of yourself so much stop saying Lord solved this problem I'm suffering that's not how you're supposed to pray do you know that Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this 10 years give us this day our our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses as you as we forgive one another and lead us not into temptation but what Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever that's how your lord responded when they were ask Lord how shall we pray that was his will you trust him you look to him for everything every single day but the effects of this culture has certainly caused our minds to be pulled away from what his desire and Will was for our lives musicians everyone God bless you I'm untraditional in how I do things I'm going to dismiss now and say you have 15 minutes before 9: if you want to take that time and pray in your seat take that time and pray at the altar that's up to you but let me give you a suggestion maybe don't pray this time for yourself maybe pray this time for God's will for your life that you would see it more clearly understand what he's looking for out of you at this moment then maybe pray for somebody else stop praying for yourself so much start praying for somebody else and then I think we'll be getting in the condition of his bride God bless you your dis dismissed I'm going to hand it over to the Musicians being in prayer for brother Gabe we'll see him Sunday May the Lord bless him and brother Ben next Wednesday God bless you [Music]
