========================================

you alone are [Music] worthy are worthy of all the praise [Music] worthy your name lord we bless your name praise the lord amen this is different amen but i like it in the men's thing is nice it's not as beautiful as when the sisters are here but hey we did what we could amen god bless you it's good to see you all here and we're so happy for the brothers that were able to gather and we know many are gathering at home via the internet through streaming and we just thank god for that i have to turn my mic on praise the lord i usually don't forget that unless we do something unusual like have a weird service in a different way let's take our bibles and turn to first peter chapter one and we'll just get started right away i just want to give an update on the saints that had been sick and that had been sick with the coven 19. uh most of you know sister bestie wood is back home she's doing really really well uh by the grace of god but the steve and sister marshall home and recovering well but from everybody i talk to it's just one of those things that they just stay tired day after day after day it lingers so just be praying that god will give them strength supernaturally strengthen them god is healing them they're doing much much better their home brothers stephen sister and marsha are no longer under quarantine so they can get out when they feel like getting out they just don't feel like getting out and sister bessie the same way but brother dave wood he's never had one symptom he's been feeling good but he's still locked down under quarantine for another week so pray for him as well but we thank god for his mercies amen well also brother tom and sister barb were quite sick a little over a week ago they've been sick brother tom took sister barb to the emergency room and she had some tests but she she was tested positive for influenza b she got some treatment she started feeling better but brother tommy's still lingering with that tiredness low-grade fever day after day and so he's been struggling with that so be praying for him that god will just turn that situation around he says i feel all right i'm just tired all the time so we need to pray for him and then i found out friday brother gene petry he had been sick and i didn't realize he had been sick for almost a week but they tested him and friday he tested positive for coping 19 but never had to go to the doctor hospital he's at home he said he's recovering he's feeling better he's seeing improvement but the same thing just feels wiped out and tired all the time so we just pray we thank god for his mercy amen thank god for his promise of healing that by his stripes we are already healed but we just ask the lord to just quicken the healing process and we know god promised us healing it's a promise miracles weren't promised to us miracles are an instant recovery but healing is a process and many of our brothers and sisters are going through the process but we just ask god to quicken that process for them to get them feeling strong and healthy and everybody else is doing good and we thank god for that and we just look forward and long for the day that this trial has passed but we know that if this trial passes we're just getting ready to step into the next one so you know that's just the way it is and here at the end time they're coming fast the birth pains are increasing in the earth and everything is speeding up and the intensity and the frequency of birth pains is growing and the trials seem to be coming faster and more intense all the time amen it must be time to fly god is doing a good job of pulling all the feathers out of the nest i don't know about you but this world is less comfortable for me now than it was even a couple weeks ago so god in his mercy he knows exactly what his children need and he knows how to make us uncomfortable and more uncomfortable and more uncomfortable until the greatest desire in our heart is to see him manifested glorified his word performed and us to move to the next phase that he has for us i believe god has to get get us to the place where this world is not our home not that we just say it with words but we know it from the bottom of our heart all the way through this world is not our home and there's no place of rest here and here we have no continuing city and god is doing a good job for me he's doing a good job of getting me to that place and i thank him for it it's his great mercy for us amen as we uh look into this word let's just start here at first peter 1 verse 23. verse uh chapter 1 verse 23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever born again not of corruptable seed that was our first birth but of incorruptable we're born of an incorruptible seed by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for this word god we just asked that you would have your way with us that you would move upon us in a special way lord we're gathered together in an unusual format lord but while we're just seeking your leadership and your wisdom and all that we do and asking that you would just anoint us lord god to receive from you what you have for us today speak lord through these lips of clay deliver your word lord through an imperfect vessel may you deliver a perfect word and lord may it bring a perfect life to your waiting children we love you father and we ask that you would have your mercy bless those that are home lord bless those that are recovering lord we just pray that you would speed up the process that you would quicken them and strengthen them lord and help everyone to feel well and strong and healthy and lord we look forward to the day lord when you gather us all home we love you god and we ask for your blessings in jesus christ's name amen god bless you as you're seated i also want to remind everybody of the prayer times we've made no change to the prayer times there's there's no restrictions there so the prayer times are still friday from one to five saturday from five to ten here in the sanctuary it'll be open there was several that still gathered for prayer but i noticed the numbers were down and one let everybody to know that there's no restriction there it's very easy for us to have a time of prayer we just slip in one at a time find a separated place pray and slip out so that that can continue on with no changes so if you want to come join us for that friday one to five saturday five to ten as usual and as we as we think about the the place that we're in this is so unusual you know in my life i've never seen anything like what's going on in the world right now but as i meditate on it and reflect i realize that god is extending another hand of mercy to this world and they're receiving another hand of mercy a great hand of mercy because god has has created a a pandemic a scare throughout the whole world that is causing people to reflect on their mortality in a in a way that most people haven't reflected on it in fact i think it's amazing that that so many people hate their lives i mean you work with people we're out and about we hear comments and so many people are dissatisfied with their lives they're miserable every day they don't like where they work sometimes they don't like who they're married to they don't like you know where they live they don't have enough money they don't have enough of this and they're totally dissatisfied with life but all of a sudden when when their life comes in jeopardy or there's a threat to it they go through extreme measures to try to save the life they're not even satisfied with you know it's to me it's mind-boggling that what people will go through the extreme measures and the fear and paranoia to save something they didn't value before they would complain about it and speak negative about it and all of these things but now now they're paranoid to lose what they didn't even like i say oh god what mercy he's granted to them to think about their life and think about mortality and quit complaining for a minute and and think about god and think about eternal life and think about the future and what happens if we die amen god has given the world an opportunity to reflect on their mortality and then he's taken all the families and put them back together amen you know most so many people were out of work they said 90 of the americans are under a stay-at-home order amen and a majority of them are working from home or lost their jobs and now you have mom and dad back home with the kids again there's no school and they're back home and they're not going to sporting events and they're not running the practices and they're not doing dance and music lessons and all these activities they're back home amen god this is an act of mercy if the world spurns this opportunity i don't know that they'll get another one what more can god do amen god can make you face your life make you face mortality and then put the family back together and say this is the way it's supposed to be think about me and come back together amen and if we come out of this going right back to where we were and the world goes right back to where it was god cannot be held accountable he has done all that he can do amen most people see this as a terrible thing this is god's mercy and grace to the world no the whole world is affected the whole world is talking about the whole world is thinking about it and may some awaken may something inside come to life and awaken and make people realize that there is a god in heaven and the way we're going is not right amen people have more time now than they've ever had to pray to think about god to spend with their families i said god let it not be wasted let it not be wasted but accomplish that purpose so god is good through every obstacle every trial god is doing multiple things he's he's manifesting himself in many ways and he's accomplishing many goals at the same time and it's hard to out-figure god or figure what he's doing but he knows he absolutely knows what he's doing and and may accomplish all of his work and may accomplish it in us whatever he's trying to do in us may it be accomplished whatever he's trying to do and this is individuals whatever he's trying to do in me i want it to be accomplished right now i don't want to breeze through this time and have missed what he's trying to tell me what i'm trying to learn and he's trying to teach me i want to learn it and so when i today for a title i just i want to talk about resurrection of the original life resurrection of the original life and if you think about two weeks ago we were all gathered here two weeks ago on sunday and uh i preached on the move of the spirit and i want to continue this thought on from there and i'll do a little bit of review from that some of the things we pulled together from there and then move from that with some of the thoughts i didn't get to share but when we look at first peter it says that we're being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god so there's the new birth is not like the old birth your original birth your your first your natural birth i should say came by corruptable seed it was already corrupted by the fall in the garden but we're to be born again of incorruptible seed by the word of god praise god so that word of god amen and the spirit of god is bringing a birth amen of the incorruptible seed but in order to have a birth of the incorruptable seed there must already be an incorruptible seed present yes yeah amen so we know that let's turn to genesis chapter one and look at genesis 1 and verse 1. i'd say this is probably one of the most unusual easter services i've ever been in because in the for this easter service the men have separated from their families easter is traditionally a family time or here at church the children aren't with us the wives aren't with us i mean it's everything is different everything is unusual everything has changed and you realize god is breaking every tradition in the whole world god is breaking everything amen the the the pope is presenting a uh easter mass to an empty basilica he's breaking every tradition amen he's breaking family traditions he's breaking national traditions he's breaking church traditions i don't think god is interested in our traditions i don't think he's interested in what we normally do on easter or what is our family tradition or what we normally think should be accomplished amen god's going to break everything in our own thinking he's going to break everything in the world's thinking and he's going to have his way and god is powerful enough he can break anything he wants to break and he will break it and he will shatter it until there's no more of man no more of man's ideas and man's traditions but it's going to be his word and his word only and pray praise god it's unusual it's strange but praise god if this is where we're at this is where we're at let god be god and let his way be my ways and if if i have to lose some of my tradition let it go just let it go just let me live the life he wants me to live and whatever position he puts me in let me just shine the light of the gospel wherever he plants me let me bloom in that that that situation in that field in genesis 1 is where we were two weeks ago we started genesis 1 verse 1. in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and brother branham explains to us that there was a previous civilization on the earth there was there was trees there was nature there was a civilization and something had happened and now the world after this creation between genesis 1 verse 1 and 1 verse 2 there's a destruction that sets in because of something that happened upon the earth and now we find in verse 2 the world under judgment and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said and let there be light and there was light so we find that now the world because of judgment is thrown into chaos and and it's without form and it's void and darkness is upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved and so this is the first time that that in the scripture account we see the spirit of god move and when the spirit of god moved what did the spirit of god move what was the move of the spirit to accomplish the moving of the spirit was to bring the word into manifestation he said let there be light and there was light and brother benham described how the holy ghost was was cooing amen as a brooding over the earth amen and his god spoke his word the holy ghost was brooding over the earth to bring that word into manifestation and when the light began to shine and the waters began to part he said there was seeds that was already laying down there from a previous civilization and he knew that those were germatized seeds and all they needed was the light and when the light struck them amen they would come to life so the holy ghost began to brood and begin to bring the separation of waters amen and begin to let the light strike the soil and begin to when he says let the uh the grass bring forth and the trees bring forth they were bringing forth what was already there so the holy ghost was brooding over what was already there to bring it into manifestation so the move of the holy ghost is there to move the word to advance the word to to nurture and bring forth the word into manifestation and so the holy ghost comes upon us to do what to bring the word to life and to bring it into manifestation amen it's it's not like in a in a pentecostal denominational idea that the move of the spirit is just there to make us excited many times seeing the spirit of god move is exciting it's a thrill amen to see god move amen to feel his presence to see something and feel something tangible it's an absolute thrill to us and we love it and we should never lose our enthusiasm for that but the move of the spirit is to bring the man the word into manifestation to brood over brood over the seed amen and bring it up amen and where it bears fruit and brings full manifestation and brother brahman says that god's provided a place of worship as i said the other day when god moved and struck the sun across the earth he knowed them palm trees and everything was laying down under the earth they were part of the earth at that time so were you and when he raised up the son of god on easter morning and sent forth the holy spirit it was to quicken also the seed of eternal life that he foreknew before the foundation of the world that would be here so god already knew that there was a seed of eternal life amen that's why amen he that the father draws half life amen that's why they that believe amen already half life they already had life amen so so many times we talk amen amen we we catch terms and these terms aren't wrong terms amen but but we say we receive life we do receive life we receive life to quicken the life it's life coming to life amen amen it's it's it's an impartation of life because there's already life laying there waiting to spring forth into life so so you have to already have life amen there was an eternal seed already there just like when god said let there be light amen god wasn't speaking amen and bringing a manifestation of light just to prove that i can make light there's been no god has not performed anything in his word amen just just to perform everything has a purpose amen and god said let there be light amen because he knew that there was seeds already laying there and he had to bring the light and he's typing in natural what's going to happen spiritually for us because he knows there's an eternal seed laying there there's eternal life already there and it takes the light of the full power the gospel of god's word to quicken that seed to life and so it's already there just has to be quickened to life in god's power to transform he says there he died and everything that was spoke of him in his death was fulfilled to bring light and life to all the predestinated seed of god that was upon the earth he brought the way to do it here is the seed the spirit brings the life transforming sons and daughters of god from the world in this dark chaos to be the sons and daughters of god let's go to galatians chapter 4 together galatians chapter 4 and verse 6. we're just going to read one portion here galatians 4 and 6. and because you are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father so the because you are sons god has sent the spirit of his son into your hearts grabbing out of a father he didn't send the spirit to your heart to make you a son he sent the spirit into your heart because you were sons amen what a powerful thing that we've learned in this day by the preaching of the prophet in this day to shed the light on this that that we've already were sons from before the foundation of the world before there was a molecule a speck of anything created we already were sons already had eternal life we're already predetermined and predestined to be here in a body of flesh amen to manifest his word but because of a fall in the garden now the earth is shrouded in darkness and overshadowed and we come into the world covered in darkness and the seed is covered in darkness because our minds are darkened and alienated against the things of god because of the judgment that we're under because of the fall we're born in judgment this earth amen comes out amen under a judgment and covered in darkness but god knows there's seeds there and because god predestinated the seed there it's god's responsibility to work everything out to make sure the light strikes that seed so that it can come to life and fulfill the purpose he purposed from before the foundation of the world amen that's why if there's any if there's a seed there god knows that seeds there and god has to get the light to that seed it's his responsibility that's why he sends his spirit upon the earth to take his spoken word and bring it to pass amen to part the waters to shine the light to bring up the seed to do everything that has to be done to make us manifested sons and daughters of god it's his responsibility not ours amen and if god has done that for us amen it's because we were with him before the foundation of the world it had nothing to do with our merit while we were lost it had nothing to do with our conduct it had nothing to do with our will and our desire or any of that it had everything to do with his predestinated plan amen there was already eternal life there and he had to bring it into manifestation and he did amen why was there a prophetic ministry through the 40s and 50s and 60s why such supernatural events took place on this earth why was there a ministry that was recorded like no ministry has ever been recorded amen because i was going to be here in this day and he knew it before the foundation of the world because you were going to be here in this day and he had to bring it in the manifestation and the only way he could is for that light to strike that seed and this earth and it has to come to life and then he continues to brood over us amen to make sure that that seed keeps growing into the restoration of the bride's tree until it bears the same fruit that he bore it's his work and his responsibility it's his life you realize that seed of eternal life that's the real you that's the real you but that real you is really him it's him it's a portion of him that he calls son or daughter but it's him who is jesus christ jesus christ was god in the form of sign it was god as a son amen and that attribute that portion of god that is in you it's him but it's really you and it's the real genuine you and the real genuine you is him [Applause] that's why there's nothing to worry about amen there's nothing to be afraid of there's nothing to fret over god is in absolute control of everything because it's him amen our minds amen are still amen still subject to the things of the world and carnality that's why we must have the mind of christ but it's that life on the inside that's the real genuine us which is him [Applause] and there's nothing to be afraid of he's not going to lose that seed amen and nothing's going to happen nothing's going to happen out of his plan see when we get into situations where our world's in chaos and losing work and people getting sick and in regulations and and laws and confusion everywhere amen there's nothing to worry about god has a habit of bringing life out of chaos go all the way back to genesis 1 2. he's got a habit of bringing life out of chaos he has a habit of disrupting everything so that his perfect plan can come into manifestation and if god is going to disrupt this world then let him disrupt the world if it's going to disrupt my ideas let my ideas be disrupted if it's going to disrupt my family gathering for easter let it be disrupted because when god disrupts the world it's for his purpose amen i say god just shatter our thinking and have your way this is this is the day where you have to know who you are there's no option anymore friends you have to know who you are and you have to know who you belong to because things are uncertain they'll get more uncertain that's for certain things are in chaos still can get more chaotic they can get much much worse than this you have to know who you are you have to know what is that life on the inside is it just me with an idea and a hope and or is it something far beyond that there's something so real inside of me something moving me something genuine something from before the foundation world that i can't explain i can't take out and measure i can't show a certificate i can't give you any proof but there's something in me that's moving me there's something in me that's not that's not the carnal part of me that's real and genuine and taking control it's got to be that way friends praise god brother bam says in the rising of the sun now as the sun was sent across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life it was not to bring all the dirt to light but it was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the life he's talking about you he's talking about you a part of the dirt that's enclosed around a life amen and the life is already there and the dirt is just dead dirt of the earth amen but it's the life inside that's going to make the dirt manifest the word not all men will receive christ oh no but those which god for ordained to life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's the one he comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun is so hot that rock say this old sun is so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for that's why you know you come to the sometimes and and the preaching is hot the sun is hot amen and the dirt says oh that's hot that hurts amen but the seed says that's what i'm looking for that's what i'm looking for the old sun is so hot but the little seed said that's what i'm looking for and he began to spring forth the life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent to quicken the was was not to quicken the rock not to quicken the dirt but to quicken the life of the seed so that means in that seed in your soul was a germ of life was life eternal life and it took life to quicken the life it took the word to bring forth the word it took the spirit to unlock the spirit you realize it's all the same thing it's two parts of the same thing counterparts of the same thing we have to understand that amen or else we think something else came to me and made me something different no you were something different on the outside but down on the inside whatever came to you you were a reflection of that whatever it was that came to quick in that life amen was the same thing that that life is made out of and come from the same source so it's not different it's the same amen brother bam says in broken cisterns no pumping up its powers within itself it needs no priming yes sir for itself its own life is in itself that's the way the seed of god is on a man's heart that's the way seed of god is in a man's heart the life of god is within the individual not in the church in you it's in you you're the one that has the germ of life in you that's why this is a good day to remember it's not in the church most of our congregation is not in the church they are the church and the life isn't in the building the life is in the building of his children the tabernacles of flesh that he's dwelling in amen that's where they're housing the life amen and you have the germ the individual you've got the life amen that's why when god breaks breaks apart fellowship he's going to break it completely apart one day one day it's going to be totally completely broke apart the doors will be closed we won't be able to gather in this church anymore but it won't change the life one drop and you don't have to go anywhere to get the life the life was in you before the foundation of the world you didn't have to arrive somewhere to get it or to get another portion of it amen it's already there the full potential of the seed whatever that seed will be is in the seed and was always in the seed that's why when brother branham said you go out to the ocean and you take a teaspoon and dip out some of the ocean everything that's in the ocean is in your teaspoon only in a portion and he said that's the way that you are if the spirit of god is living inside of you you've got a portion amen and whatever god is and capable of he's capable of in you amen because it's him in you you don't have to go somewhere and get it it's already there it just has to be unlocked it has to be drawn out it has to be coming to manifestation so god will allow every terrible circumstance that you can name in the book to come to draw out that life because it's already there he says how do you get the fragrance how do you get the oil out of a rose he said you crush it amen he didn't put any fragrance in it he had to get it out he didn't put any oil in it he had to get it out and in order to get it out he had to crush it amen it's already there but sometimes it takes a trial to get it to come out sometimes it takes a change in circumstances to get it to come out amen praise be to god brother said every apple that's hanging on an apple tree was in it when it was in seed form praise god it's in you it is the rising of the sun he says the real eagle recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position it's a wake-up call the eagle got a wake-up call because he was an eagle you got a wake-up call because you were a sieging of god you heard this word others heard it and all they could say was that's so hot but something in you said that's what i'm looking for that's what i want in the thinking man's filter it says notice the word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was there see you realize we're coming to maturity under the preaching of the gospel brother branham came not so that we would have a denominational idea of things but so that we would go back to the original understanding and go back to our origins and that's why when i'm preaching the resurrection of original life amen you in order to have a resurrection the first has to be a death but what's resurrected is the original life amen and so now we've got to die amen but not that eternal life can't die it can never die it was never going to die it was never predestinated to die but this outer shell has got to die amen the the wrong nature coming through the wrong birth has got to die so that there can be a resurrection of the original life that was in god before the foundation of the world amen brother bram says in the rising of the sun because i live you live also speaking to his wife because i live ye live also what a resurrection that was water resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power amen is this your resurrection amen this is our resurrection they call this resurrection sunday and a lot of people will just reflect back on what was done two thousand years ago what was done two thousand years ago amen was the rising of the sun so that the spirit could come back upon the seeds that were laying under the judgment of the earth so that it could spring to life and manifest what's always been laying there it wasn't so we could always look back and say he died at calvary he died at calvary of course he died at calvary and paid the price of my redemption but he had to bring a price and he had to bring a blood that would cleanse amen so that he can cleanse and sanctify so that he can indwell and we can keep looking back and looking back and the whole world is looking back amen they're looking back and having a little ceremony sprinkling a little water and saying a few words in latin and talking about jesus died so that we could be saved but not realizing that there has to be a resurrection today that resurrection was only to pave the way for my resurrection and your resurrection and there still has to be a resurrection let this be a real resurrection sunday where somebody here or somebody on the internet will resurrect and spring to life amen because there's a seed there just waiting for the conditions to get right for the holy ghost to bring the parting of the water and bring the word upon the sea and may it happen today may this be your resurrection today may there be life come forward what life the life that's always been there waiting for the sun to shine amen this isn't a tradition amen let it never be a tradition amen may it be a resurrection and every time that light shines oh may it bring a fresh burst of life a new growth and new fruit popping out on the tree never get away from resurrection life because he lives i live i lived when he lives amen i've always lived because he's always been alive but now it's time amen for the resurrecting life to be on display [Applause] hallelujah not a tradition let god break the traditions amen praise be to god let's go to ephesians chapter 2. ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins amen you're laying there dead no signs of life now that doesn't mean there wasn't eternal life there it was there but it was in a dead state no signs of life it was dead brother brenham he would begin to say that underneath that water on that that first day of creation in genesis 1 2 he said those seeds were already germatized and that you came already a german thy seed so there was life there but it was in a dead state the wrong life was being portrayed and you had the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen verse 5 even when we were dead in sins amen sins are an attribute of unbelief we're laying their dead in unbelief ignorant to the things of god not knowing them amen and we have attributes of that unbelief hallelujah but when that deadness of unbelief and the deadness of sin amen is taken away amen and the quickening power of god comes and brings us the revelation of jesus christ the mystery made known to us in this hour now there's a springing forth of life and there must be new attributes on display attributes not of sin but attributes of faith not of unbelief but of faith and now it brings a different life and a different manifestation because the life we lived before were the attributes of sin or unbelief but now faith has sprung up in our hearts amen it's been quickened to us made alive and awake and now there's got to be a different set of attributes on display and there are attributes that come from faith not unbelief but in order to be quickened you have to first be dead i mean it seems like such a simple it seems simple but i think it gets missed so many times in order to be made alive you have to first be reckoned dead that's why i feel like we have too many alive people trying to be alive right we need dead people made alive dead to self dead to carnality dead to flesh dead to the first birth the natural birth dead to all of that so that we can really be alive because you can't do both at the same time brother bam says and the greater than solomon is here in 1962 if you want to be a christian you be born again die to yourself and start from the bottom and come forth there won't be no blow ups along the road you'll be able to hold the charge that the holy ghost puts in you that's right if you don't you'll never be able to stand that that's all the lord bless you that's a rude thing to say isn't it but i hope you get what i'm talking about i believe that you've got to die so dead till you're no more yourself he's talking about your your natural birth your natural man you're no more yourself that's all and then be born again new a new creature in christ built from the very bottom of your soul all the way through a real born-again christian then the holy spirit knows what kind of load to put in you that's right you'll be able to pack it let's go to matthew 28 i want to read a couple scriptures in sequence matthew 28 and 5. matthew 28 5 and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear not for you know that you seek jesus who was crucified he is not here for he has risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he goes before you unto galilee there shall you see him lo i have no i have told you in order to have a resurrection you have to have a death even in the original resurrection of jesus christ you had to have a death to have a resurrection and and he says and the angel says go tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and i say today if we're going to have a resurrection we've got to start with a death and if you want to be resurrected in the newness of life amen don't be afraid to be dead it's time now to be dead and then if we can see the world's conditions it's time amen we say you know what this world is not my home amen i've been afraid to be dead because still some things i wanted some still some plans i had still some likes that i had but it's time to let those things die let's go to romans chapter 6. romans chapter 6 and verse 3 know you not that so many of us were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism unto death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin if we can be planted in the likeness of his death amen if you can just let that seed be planted your whole life and let all the outside of it rot away and die amen rot away and die why because there's a life on the inside and as long as it walks around here just in seed form it can be germatized seed form friends but if it walks around amen i mean there's there's nothing on the inside coming to manifestation on the outside all you say there's a seed i'm a sea gene of god i'm a seed of god but what good does it do until you plant that seed and let everything around it rot and die and fall away and decay amen so that what was on the inside can come out to the outside so so many times we say i'm a c gene of god i'm a seed of god amen but you've got to be a manifested seed gene of god you've got to go through the process of dying and rotting out amen being planted in the likeness of his death to come forth in the likeness of his resurrection say god let everything around me die and rot amen so many times we have preaching and the preaching like we said sometimes is red hot and scorching and it hits you know it hits my hobbies sometimes it hits my likes it hits my fashions it hits all this amen and why has it always got to be preached like that why is it always every time i come to church he's talking about you know the thing that i enjoy my entertainment or my hobby or my fashion or my life amen god is trying to get you to rot amen he is trying with everything in him because he knows the potential that's laying on the inside and that potential is going unrealized as we walk around saying i'm a seed gene of god i'm a seed of god but scared to get down amen and be planted in the likeness of his death and hate our very lives amen until you hate your life you're not ready to be born again until you hate what you are tell you hate the way you think till you hate the way your flesh craves things until you absolutely are disgusted at your humanity you're not ready to be resurrected to life too many people amen are happy amen so much of this and so much of this a percentage of living for god and a percentage of doing my own way amen that's not resurrection life yet friends until we're planted in the likeness of his death how dead was he he was dead all the way dead brother branham said so dead till the world recognized that he was dead amen we want to be a sea gene of god that's fine but he's looking for a manifested seed gene of god he's looking for a seed gene of god amen a life on the inside amen but that life on the inside he wants to come on the outside in the original and then back in genesis 1 if he was just happy doing the recedes laying there and bringing satisfaction to his heart there's a palm tree there and an oak tree there that's not what satisfied him what satisfied him is when what he knew was laying there in a mystery came into full manifestation and began to bear fruit of the life that was in it that's when that's what satisfied him he's not satisfied with us saying amen there's a seed of god on the inside i'm a no he's satisfied when whatever he placed there to be manifest in this day has gone through the process of regeneration amen so now that it is displaying the very life that's on the inside hallelujah amen god will come sunday after sunday wednesdays playing tapes however it comes he'll come and he'll say rot die die to that thing you love so much what's it doing it's ruining the potential that's in the seed it's holding it back we want to see manifestations but we've got to die first we want to see god fully displayed in his full power but there's got to be a full rotting out first there's got to be a complete death to self amen a total abandonment for myself and dying into where i'm not afraid he can do with me what he wishes it's no longer my idea it's what he wants god may be getting us to the place sooner than later where even our desire for our job will be gone amen our income our home who knows maybe we'll hit such devastation and despair that will start living with each other don't think it can't happen the retirement wiped out mortgages called notes called no home to live in we may be packing into each other's houses talk about a close fellowship iron sharpened iron we're going to be sharp brother i'm not saying it will happen but i'm saying it can happen and what's happening now in the world is proving to us anything can happen god can wreck the whole system in a manner of weeks if he wants to days if he feels like it and whatever he wants to accomplish he will accomplish amen and maybe that job that we love and that retirement account we're banking on that home that we've worked so hard on maybe it will mean nothing in the next few weeks few months few years maybe it won't mean anything to us maybe he'll take a few more feathers out of the nest and throw it to the side so that we can say truly this world is not my home i don't care anymore about what happens to me all i want to do is be pleasing to him the disciples got to the place amen where that seed inside of them sprung to life where they didn't matter if they were stoned if they were beat if they were in prison if they were mocked if they were scorned amen if they were chased from city to city it didn't change them anymore because they had died that's what death looks like death doesn't look like i'll endure this little trial for a few days and then i'll go back to doing what i want to do amen and say i'm glad that's over that's not death death is saying if he wants to hang me upside down and nail me to a cross then that's what i want if he wants to strip away all my worldly goods that's what i want it's an actual death to self so that what's on the inside can live it's a big statement to make but we might actually get to live it sometime it's time to come to terms with it now god can do what he wants with himself do you realize that that was god in jesus christ being spit on being mocked and made fun of rejected that was gone who is it in you it's god and god can accomplish what he wants with himself the seeding of god is an attribute of god god will fulfill all his word in us let's go to galatians chapter 2. galatians chapter 2 verse 20. i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me this life is to be lived in the flesh because this flesh is to manifest that life but we have to first be crucified with christ let's go to chapter five 5 and verse 24 and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so we know now that in order to be born again we've got to die in order to be quickened we have to die in order to be resurrected we have to die so the goal is to die don't worry about coming to life he'll take care of that our objective is to die and to stay dead to be completely dead you know we have sometimes we have so much worry and so much strain on on on the new birth i want to be born again i want the baptism holy ghost that's something he'll do that's a gift we receive that by faith that's god's doing but really what we should focus on is dying spend all of our time and focus all of our attention on dying amen and let him take care of the living [Applause] we do that instead of getting the cart before the horse amen i want the baptism holy ghost i want the new life i want to know that i'm born again just make sure you're dead amen and when you think you're dead die some more amen when you think you've died some more die a little more he'll take care of the resurrection because it's the same spirit that raised him will raise you it's his doing it was god who sent the holy ghost to brood over the earth to bring the seeds to life god's the one who sent it now amen to bring it to life he'll bring it to life you just reckon yourself dead be planted in the likeness of his death be crucified with christ and let god bring life sometimes we focus on the wrong things in the wrong order then we get ourselves confused now it's time to die brother graham said in the rising of the sun he says now see now you're already resurrected when god raised him up he raised you the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now why do you know your soul changed didn't it your body came obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what a church the word which is the life when you are now resurrected from the dead it is easter with jesus and i it's easter with you and jesus it's easter with you i and jesus we are all or jesus you and i we are all resurrected together amen that's my easter not a tradition not a tradition with a certain flowers and a new dress on sunday and that's not easter amen god broke that friends no new dresses no no new dresses no no new this no knew that but a real easter a real resurrection with jesus christ where he brings me up from death brother remember says in the invisible unit of the bride of christ how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born an adulteress you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it no it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world god put your name in the lamb's book of life i don't want this to i want this to drill home i just want to teach on this for a minute and maybe take my time but that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world if we had come the right way we would have never been born like we were born with the nature that we were born with that was a sin nature could come from unbelief in god's word and we came with a nature of unbelief amen and that nature amen we conducted ourselves in a certain way by that nature but down under that in the soul is a germ of life that's there too it's there also but it's laying there dormant waiting for something to bring it to life but this outer hall in the soul of this wrong birth has got to die and rot amen so that the life that's already there can come to life that germ that was in you that germ of eternal life amen that's that seed gene that gene of god all the things all the terms brother branham used and he really nails this down in the last year of his ministry and especially in the last few months of his ministry he really starts emphasizing this so that the believer will know how firmly they are planted in christ but if you had come the right way you would have been born without the overshrouding of unbelief without the sin nature without the wrong nature you would have been born only with the nature that was the sea gene of god and you would have been born what a manifested seed of christ you would have been christ manifest in your form and there would have been no struggling with sin there would have been no falling away there would have been no lust of the flesh there would have been none of that you would have come the right way but we came the wrong way and he says there's no fault of your own but even though it's no photo of your own you've got to die to it and the message communion the last message brother branham preached like i said he brings this out down the very end of his ministry if you follow him all the way through and you catch what he's trying to teach us at the end of his ministry it absolutely will thrill your soul it puts such a foundation under your feet that you'll be unshakable no matter what happens everything's fine no matter what happens around me everything's okay because god through his prophet has told me i came from god and i go to god and that peace that's in me was always eternal life and i can no more be lost and god can be alive and that germ of life was to be me from the original a son of god a chip off the old block a peace of god broke forth do we understand that that's why when we talk about the baptism of the holy ghost amen it's really the baptism of the holy ghost is a part of god's life coming to quick and a part of god's life do we understand that a part of god's life coming to quicken a part of god's life life coming to life eagle to eagle word to word oh praise be to god communion he says i say this taking for myself like you was going to say william branham well 40 years ago the william branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say william branham he was a rank rascal see because i was born of charles and ella branham in their nature i was a sinner i come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me this is good friends this is personal he said i beg this person about me but he made it personal about me too i see myself in their nature i was a sinner i came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present see predestinated was in there by god in this same body see two natures in there down in here there was two i come with the wrong nature from my wrong birth but down in there was a germ of god another nature just waiting to be expressed waiting to be quickened to life by the baptism of the holy ghost in the same body see two natures in there well i only catered to one as i growed i grew as a baby dad first thing you know i became a liar became everything else that a sinner because i raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of life all the time what was it there was another william branham see oh praise be to god there was another william branham the correct one the one that should have come the correct way but now there was one that came a perverted way so it was a pervert i'd say this way it was a perverted life of william branham it had to die so that the true william branham down on the inside could come to manifestation that part that was to be you from the beginning there was another william branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of god the word of god that was placed in there now then one day as i walked on that voice talked don't never smoke drink so forth and the young fellows and all got older and there was something moving but yet all at once i looked up and said i'm not the son of charles and ella branham there's something calling like my little eagle i'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you are open up i want to come home there's something in me calling then i was born again that little life was laying there the life of the water was poured upon it then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven but in the sea of god's forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more see now we stand justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of god why because god knew what portion was to be you he knows he knows what seeds were there in genesis 1 2. when the spirit of god moved he knew what was going to come forth he knew where the life was he knows what's to be you amen in that part you come of no fault of your own but that part has got to die the unbelief has got to die the nature has got to rot away from us because you're gonna have two natures in one body amen the one gene of god was there all the whole time friends it's always been there amen the gene does it come to you the gene's already been there amen the counterpart comes to quicken it to life brother remember says the god who is rich in mercy i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out he's going to straighten out doctrine and let him straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare oh praise be to god you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before the well when he before he even became material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color hair you would have he knowed all about you the only thing happened is when you're being a sinner many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was god somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then amen all along through life little checks little little uncomfortable feelings little stop stopping along the way and sometimes we would sear our conscience with a hot iron and learn to push past that thing but it was still there we just had to train ourselves to push past that we had to we had to move on and commit the sins that we wanted to commit but it was there it was always there amen that little form of life in you then and then after a while you heard the gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of god you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you hallelujah the word seen the word that was in you who came who come hunting who the chicken in the yard didn't go hunting anything amen it was the other it was the mama eagle that came hunting the the baby eagle it was the holy ghost that came to brood over the seed it was god that came after you the seed was in you always the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you came to it why male and female have got to come together male word female word have got to come together and spring forth life hallelujah friends brother bam says i read these two quotes last time but i'd like to read them again just for context in the rapture december 65 he says then now do we get into this body first corinthians 12 by one spirit we're all baptized into this body by one holy spirit baptism that if you want to put that down in first corinthians 12 13 and by one spirit we are all baptized and the spirit is the life of christ is that right the life of christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life you get it if that life is laying in the seed and the baptism of the holy spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed life so the life has already got to be there and that life comes on it because they're the same seed their same nature same life from the same source when thou holy ghost which is christ the anointing comes upon the word that's laying in your heart it becomes the anointed it becomes a messiah why because to be christ it has to be the anointed word so christ comes back the anointing and what's he coming to anoint he's not coming to anoint your flesh amen he's not coming to an anoint an atmosphere he's coming to anoint the life that's in the seed he's coming to anoint the word that is down in your soul and that becomes the anointed word and when the whole baptism holy spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that seed life then two days later he's preaching modern events made clear by prophecy he just said that in rapture two days later he makes this statement notice we find today that there's many people just can't believe even spirit-filled people i'm going to give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the holy ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul the baptism see here's the the inside soul in here that has to come from god but then on the outside you have five senses to contact your earthly home the inside you have spirit and then there you have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth five outlets that spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of god and still be lost it's the soul that lives that was ordained of god so when the genesis 1 2 when that holy ghost began to brood over and bring the light and the light began to shine brother brahma says there was seeds there that wasn't dermatized to life they were burnt out by the water but those seeds that had life in them were the ones that came so the sun hit everything the light hit everything [Music] but only that part that already had life in it sprung to life and after it sprung into life the life inside produced the life on the outside the light was still there the holy ghost was still brooding to bring it into greater maturity and greater maturity and greater maturity but you realize that the maturity came by the genetics that was in the seed and the fruit came by the genetics that they're in the seed the works came by the genetics that were in the seed amen it wasn't it wasn't as though amen that the light could put genetics in the seed the light was there to draw everything that was in the seed out amen then this word is here the full power of the word bringing the fullness of the holy ghost is here to bring the full life that's already written in your genes and the genetic code the attribute of god it's in you to bring it to life we're not asking god to give us gifts we're not asking god to give us works we're not asking god to give us fruit manifestation it's already in the genes we're just laying in the presence of the sun so that that sun can draw all that life out of us into a manifestation we're staying in the word we're laboring in prayer we're staying under the anointed preaching of the word we're staying in the message so that all the potentials in the seed can come out when that holy ghost was brooding it wasn't putting anything in it was bringing it out and the holy ghost brooding today amen is not putting anything in it's bringing it out what's already in amen i think sometimes we pray the wrong prayer lord i i want something more i want something different and that's not a wrong prayer i mean in our heart god understands what we're praying for we want greater manifestation but really what we want is we want the freedom to be what we always were we want to come to our full potential amen and in order to come to full potential we've got to let the great husbandmen do a little pruning on the vine we've got to let him cut some things off and shave some things down and get out of us what shouldn't be there we've got to keep dying friends so that whatever life he wants is the life that keeps coming forth the holy ghost the baptism only goes confined brother man said genuine baptism holy ghost in your spirit realm and it doesn't have anything to do with the soul because no matter how many times it falls on a soul with no germ of life inside nothing will happen and an individual that has a genuine baptism of the holy ghost with the genuine spirit of god on their spirit they can have every manifestation anybody else can have they can have any manifestation of a gift i'm speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues and dreams and prophecy amen run the aisles scream and shout and dance have any manifestation but if there's no germ of life in there it was nothing but an excitement during a service or at home or wherever it was but didn't produce any life but there's those who the baptist and the holy ghost will come down upon them and there's already a germ of life and if the baptism holy ghost moves beyond flesh beyond spirit but strikes that seed that that soul and that germ that's in that soul is awakened and quickened the life then all of a sudden the life that's in there begins to come out praise be to god that's why so many times we feel like we need a another baptism of the holy ghost and another baptism holy ghost in another and there's nothing wrong with baptisms of the holy ghost not a thing wrong with them but it only takes one to quicken the seed to life what we need after we quicken the life is the brooding of the holy ghost the light and the water and the brooding to bring out what's already there brother branham isn't the message spoken word is the original seed it says and when he seen the bible was manifested again like the early days of christ see because you are a predestinated seed just like christ was i'll take that you are a predestinated seed just like christ was and when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself when the rain falls on the seed the life produces itself where is the life in the seed it takes the same kind of life to connect with that kind of life to quicken it the life to bring the life that's already in the seat out the life produces itself when the holy spirit falls when it fell on those seeds jesus said he chose them before the foundation of the world when they were predestinated seed is that right then here they hauled themselves up in the upper room these seeds the word what were those seeds of the word what were they they were the word predestinated for that day and it wasn't peter's flesh it wasn't peter's first natural birth but there was a word inside of peter's soul there was a gene of god laying in peter's soul and john's soul and mary so it was laying there amen and they drug it up he says they drug it up to the upper room and what was laying there the seed the word and the word was laying on there with without life in it and all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven as the waters began to gush down and it actually filled all the house where they were setting and the seeds began to grow it began to manifest itself the word of god being manifested amen it changed them peter was a changed man they had run away when jesus was was being crucified they had run away when jesus was being uh uh when he was being bound when he was being arrested and tried they had run away peter denied the lord amen but all the time peter was denying the lord he had a seed gene of god on the inside amen when the disciples scattered and went running away afraid they had a seed gene of god on the inside amen but peter had the audacity to go out and weep bitterly over his sin and over his mistake and and gone would be given jesus christ would reveal himself as a resurrected savior to them but there had to be something that quickened that seed to life amen and when christ went up amen he sent the holy ghost down on the day of pentecost and when that when that holy ghost fire struck amen that seed is sparked to life and what was laying there come to life and he ran out amen under that anointing and all the life that was in there began to take the word and place the word for his day he come out preaching amen he was in there hiding he came out preaching and then he was in there running he came out preaching he was in there a failure he came out successful and he began to preach amen and in acts chapter 2 let's just turn to acts chapter 2 and look at this acts chapter 2 verse 1 now remember peter loved jesus john james uh philip all of them loved jesus they loved his ministry and they had something in them that attracted them to the ministry we got that when others left there was something in them that held them to that ministry they loved it they recognized it they knew it was the word they they didn't recognize everything they couldn't piece it all together but they knew it was right and then they they believed he was the son of god amen they could even catch some revelation of who he was and and and they loved him amen but they needed something more there was something in them that was attracting them to christ but they needed something more they needed that seed to be quickened to life acts chapter 2 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance but the story is not over there turn to verse 14. they began to spill out and speaking in tongues and all the men that were gathered from all the nations there for the feast of pentecost they begin to hear they begin to hear them glorifying and praising god in their own language it was a sign that was gathering the people but verse 14 they questioned these men are drunk and peter stands up in verse 14 and he says but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of judea and all ye that dwell in jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and in my servants and all my handmaids i will pour out in those days in my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor and smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood before that great notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved peter peter now changed something quickened the life in him and peter didn't come forth now and they came forth with a mighty sign a wonder that was gathering attention to people and they made a wrong accusation they're drunk and he stood up and he and he didn't start debating whether they were drunk or not and he didn't start proving with a toxicity test he didn't he didn't go back and and try to show him you know you know in our former religion no what peter could do then after the seed was quickened inside of him peter could now take the word and place it for his day he could take what was happening and say this day this scripture is fulfilled it's not what you think amen but now amen something in him there was something in peter that could take that word and find the application for his day he was laying in the seat when peter was running away it was laying there when peter was hiding out it was laying there when he was cursing amen it was laying there when he was weeping bitterly because of his sin it was still laying there but when it was quick in the life there was something in him that was attracted amen to the manifestation for his hour and it never drove peter back amen to go back to the old system he came out of but it pushed peter and the disciples forward into the new territory of the new land that god had opened up they were sitting stagnant between two dispensations they had they had known christ had come i mean they had believed it was the son of god they had seen him after his resurrection they were firmly convinced but they didn't know what to do they were gathering together in upper room they were in prayer for 10 days they didn't know what move to make but the move the spirit come over them and when the spirit moved upon peter and it quickened that seed to life now they knew what to do according to the word and they knew where they were at they knew what day it was and they knew what word was being fulfilled see the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't take us back to a previous dispensation the baptism holy ghost doesn't move us back but pentecostal denominational teaching but the baptism holy ghost moves us forward amen into the new land that's been opened up for us until that happens we can be stuck between two dispensations we can realize that that malachi 4 has come we can realize that god sent the prophet we can realize that he come and open the seals we can realize all of those things have happened amen the seals are open the prophet has come amen this is a new day we can realize all of that amen but we're just stuck between two dispensations and what is it going to take to get us to move into the new day it's going to take the baptism of the holy ghost to quicken the seed that's inside because the seed that's inside you is a seed that was predestinated to move into the land and take all the land which is the word that's been restored to us no longer sitting between two opinions no longer sitting between two dispensations but now running full head long fully embracing this is the day this is the day this is to be fulfilled peter and the disciples never looked back they moved forward in satan's eden brother bam says i heard brother neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why why didn't i preach on the holy ghost why didn't i do this here it is hallelujah here it is the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person jesus christ the word of god established in your heart to quicken every word of this age watch the holy ghost in action not so much demonstration but in action what it does according to the word that's what happened in the upper room what was it the holy ghost not so much in demonstration there was a demonstration amen but what was the action the action was this day this word this is what joel said this is the prophecy fulfilled this is where we're moving to it's the action in you and the god of this evil age brother says the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses or five senses rather the inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience and love and so forth the outside man see tastes fill feel smell and hear but the inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept what god says and that'll determine what spirit is in there that'll determine what spirit is in there spirit and where in the soul what spirit is in the soul what is spirit life what is life the life of the seed that's been quickened to life amen and now living there's a spirit down in the soul and it's the spirit of god it'll determine what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of god it'll feed on the things of god and it won't feed on anything of the world jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of god has not even entered this inner part let's look at romans 8 together romans 8 verse 8. romans 8 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god hallelujah how much of our actions are just fleshy and determined by fleshly desire they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit of so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you praise be to god this is quickening time this body that was used to fulfill the lust of the flesh amen there's a seed on the inside that's got to be quick in the life and when we die out to everything it's quick in the life and now that quickening power brings this body that was used to manifest unbelief will now manifest faith this is the tabernacle that's used to display the life on the inside and when that when that nature all nature dies and that original nature comes to life that was that intended to be you from the beginning comes alive it'll show up it'll quicken this mortal body that same spirit dwell in you brother man says in the message you must be born again did you know that you got an old crow no matter how much you try you could paint him just as olive color as a dove just as gray as a dove white paint him all over he's still a crow inside he's still stinky and old buzzer you're just the same scavenger eat the dead things of the earth that's right but you know what a dove don't even have to take a bath oh hallelujah a dove's body because he's a dove he's got an oil that comes through his feathers that just keeps him clean all the time because it comes from the inside out oh why the buzzard says mine too i put a little holy water on them brother it fixes it no it didn't for it comes from the inside out not from the outside in it's a burst in hebrews chapter 6 out of 1957 on the hebrew series he says and a man that's born of the spirit of god becomes a dove of god his nature his change his makeup yes sir you put the spirit of the dove in the crow he'd never set on a dead carcass thinking man's filter in 1965 he says and the dove never has to take a bath a dove's body puts out oil from the inside that keeps it clean it's a life that's in the dove it generates in a oil that keeps the feathers clean and so is a christian there's a life within that keeps them clean see i want to wrap up by talking about the dove and the crow brother graham says the dove and the crow were both in the ark they were both in church they were both in noah's message two birds and they're both birds they're relatively similar in size crow's a little larger and the crow and the dove were both birds they were both in the ark they had both gathered in under the message of that day but they had two different natures and noah would release a dove but because a dove was a clean living bird can only eat the pure grain the pure word of god that dove when there was no place to land found its way back but the crow because the crow can eat either it can either eat grain or it can eat dead carrion when that crow was released it never came back but the band said it was having a jubilee hopping from one dead body floating on the water to another dead body just eating the dead things like the dead denominational stuff left over from a previous dispensation and in so many times i'm afraid that that are all around us we have crows that think they're doves crows because they can eat the grain and like it they can eat the grain and like it they're in the ark and they like the ark they like the atmosphere and they are the ark's just fine they don't have a problem with the ark don't have a problem with noah and then when he's feeding grain the dove and the crow they eat side by side and the dove says all this is good grain and the crow says oh this is good grain they both enjoy the grain they enjoy the feast they come to church they enjoy the preaching they get excited about it but they go back but when they go back and in their private life and on their cell phone and when they're in the room and when nobody's watching amen the dove won't eat dead carrying but the crow who just enjoyed the grain can enjoy the movie can enjoy the video can enjoy the images can enjoy the video games can enjoy all the worldly entertainment and come right back to church and enjoy the grain again and then go right back out and enjoy the dead things of the world and come right back in and is deceived thinking because i'm in the ark and because i like grain then i'm a dove no friends if you like amen if you like the entertainment world just as much as you like church and you enjoy the movies as much as you like church amen there's a problem if you like the dead things of the world and worldly entertainment lust of the flesh and lust of the eye if you can enjoy eating that as much as you enjoy the word amen there needs to be a death amen there needs to be a new birth something's got to change [Music] amen being in the ark is good but that's not it eating the grain is good but that's not it enjoying it all is good but that's not it remember there's got to be a nature change from the inside amen noah couldn't change amen that crow to a dove and spending time with the dove couldn't make the crow a dove brother branham said when you're born again your nature's changed you become a dove and in the dove there's a oil on the inside that comes from where becomes from the sea gene of god down in the soul that's quick in the life that oils from the inside out amen it's not coming to church to get a clean fix it's not letting the preaching of the word amen come forth and just scour me clean man that's what we have to come to before our nature's changed we have to come and and let the preaching just rake everything away from me and cut it all away amen and expose me oh praise god let it expose the fact that i need a nature change let it expose the fact that i'm still enjoying worldly things and i know that i need something to change inside of me i'm still spending hours and hours wasting my time and wasting my mind on video games shooting people i'm wasting my time on netflix i'm wasting my time on youtube i'm wasting my time playing with things of the world there needs to be a nature change there needs to be something where i say i don't no longer have an appetite for those things i don't enjoy it anymore something in me has changed it doesn't taste good to me anymore not an abstinence but a nature change amen not living in a commune not not a not an entertainment fast but a nature change where that life on the inside that god is always meant to be you from before the foundation of the world comes alive and you can honestly from your heart say i don't want it anymore i don't enjoy it like i used to enjoy i don't want to eat it even though i used to like that i don't like it anymore something in me is different now not coming to church and saying make me feel good dove doesn't need to go to church to feel good the dove doesn't need to go to church to get cleaned all around the world message churches are shut down everybody i talk to everybody i've talked to is completely shut down can't even can't even gather like we're gathered today everybody i talk to is completely shut down but it never stopped a dove once it never slowed them down and never stumbled them because a dove has something on the inside that cleans them from the inside an ah an oil a holy ghost that comes a life that comes from the seed that's been quickened the life and oils them from the inside out and keeps them clean and keeps them fresh amen the the dove is not hindered in their walk because the dove has a nature where what it needs to keep it clean is on the inside of it because messes churches are shut down and and people are off work they're at home my question is what have we done with that time what what are we eating on what are we eating on with all kinds of time home from work and and verizon gave everybody 15 extra gigs what a perfect test what a perfect test for god to show us what nature we have what a perfect opportunity for us to say you know what i'm not where i'm supposed to be amen god in his mercy if we were drawing strength from one another deliver righteous life god's going to smash that so we find out what we really are if we were just living a certain way because of being around the believers and we were getting encouragement from them to live a certain way and they were keeping us straight and all the hours of fellowship and all the good preaching was keeping me lined up amen god can smash all of that and make it go away tomorrow so that he can show you where you're really at and you can say lord i'm not satisfied with what i've seen amen i had no appetite for your word i had no appetite for the message i had no appetite for streaming but i sure had an appetite for netflix i sure had an appetite for nonsense and goofiness and foolish videos and all of this passed around and hours on social media all kinds of time that i've absolutely killed in foolishness but my appetite for your word never went up i say god help us god help us say lord we need you i need something to come from the inside out amen something that's not dependent on a brother or sister something not if all my fellowship is cut off for a year and i'm put in solitary confinement and i'm not handed a bible i want something to come from the inside out to keep me clean i want there to be a life that's been quickened by the spirit of god and i want it to be him living inside of me not that it's not a struggle not that we're not tempted and we can be tempted we can struggle we can fight but there's got to be something on the inside not coming from the outside but something on the inside's got to be coming out [Applause] if the holy ghost is doing anything for us in the preaching of the word though what the holy ghost is doing for the sea gene of god is bringing what's there to the surface and drawing it up it's not putting more in it is bringing it out there's got to be a quickening there's got to be a nature change the crow has got to die amen if we find out that there's a still a crow nature that i'm living by that i can equally feed on worldliness and filth and i can feed on that just the same as i can feed on the word it's time to get on our face and say god i want to die so thoroughly god i want to die because i want nothing but a dove nature to be expressed in me i want a real resurrection amen i don't want to be around people of a resurrection i don't want to talk about brother branham's resurrection talk about mom and dad's resurrection but i want to have my own resurrection let this be my resurrection sunday oh god let this be the time that i realized something in me something in me died something was smashed something was broke and something else quickened the life amen if it's there it's always been there it's been the thing that causes us to love the word it's been the thing that causes us to hang around for years it's been the thing that causes us to recognize is true amen but it can't just be laying there in a dormant state like it was in peter recognizing it's true but it's got to go through the fiery baptism to light it off to where that life becomes a life that begins to flow that is not outside influence influencing me amen we're done with outside influences influencing me no more is that if i can just get around the right atmosphere if i can just get around the right people i'll do right god's going to break that so you don't have that to lean on [Applause] when i'm with so-and-so i do good when i'm so so i do bad amen that doesn't affect the dove [Music] a dove will cut that off say i love you but what's inside of me doesn't match and i can't go that way if i could just have different friends i've heard people say before you know my kid's a good kid if he just was under a better influence better influence might keep him from doing certain things but what they really need is a new birth not just a better influence a better influence can can change the atmosphere a new birth can take place absolutely but they need more than a better influence anymore they need a new birth we need that seed that was always meant to be you it's got to come to life it's got to be quickened off the crow nature has got to die until that dead thing doesn't even attract my attention and you you think about those who've been born again you think back to days and you see something you hear an old song or somebody talks about an old movie something you did years ago watched years ago experienced years ago you pass an old place an old nightclub an old bar or something you used to go to and you realize there's nothing in me that wants that anymore i was so pulled i used to be so driven to do wrong there was something in me it was almost like would take control of me and move me to the wrong so attracted to watch this and i had such a hard time turning my head when there was a woman who wasn't dressed right around i was so pulled the wrong way but now you go past and you realize something's changed my appetite is different i don't even want that anymore in fact i'm repulsed by the very fact i used to be attracted to it and i and you get to the place where you can't even imagine what it was like to the place where i i can't even imagine why i even liked that what happened the crow died because then used two natures one from your natural birth to come forth the center but down in there there was the real william branham there was the real tre chad lam there was the original life that came from the father the attribute that was to be you and then and it was laying there covered over with darkness with this wrong nature amen and down in your soul amen it had to die it had to die you had to hate it you had to despise it it couldn't be that you know i still really want to do this so i'm not ready to give my heart to the lord yet that's not it yet friends it's got to be till you loathe the creature that you are many of us have gone through that experience where we want to serve god and all of a sudden all you do is mess up and mess up and mess up and you keep falling in the same thing and falling in the same thing amen and god is getting you to the place where you absolutely hate the creature that you are you despise it and you despise its lust and you so wish it would die how many of you went through that experience wanting to serve god but in your flesh there's no capacity and you find that you fall flat on the very thing you said you would never do again and seemingly you were powerless to overcome it and then you hated yourself for it and you hated what you were oh hallelujah that's the place we need to get to if you haven't come to that yet amen say god help me to hate this flesh help me to hate my natural birth help me to hate what came from my parents helped me to hate what came from the fall we can't still kind of like it friends it's got to be an absolute abhorring it i hate it and i don't want nothing to do with it and out of the ashes of that death out of that burning down of the old life there's something else laying there waiting to come forth but it won't compete there won't be any competition this one's got to die for this one to live let it be a resurrection sunday monday tuesday wednesday it doesn't matter it doesn't have to take place in church it doesn't have to take place while listening to church it doesn't it could take place in your car it could take place in your prayer closet it could take place on a walk it could take place in this building tonight it could take place in your home where you're sitting it could take place just let god burn it out and die and reckon yourself dead and crucify the flesh and say god make that live inside of me bring your spirit to me and whatever amen whatever goes with it i'll take whatever sensation whatever manifestation i just got to have the quickening off i got to have the lighting of the candle i got to have the spark that ignites what's inside of me so that it's no longer me it's you living your life through me there's a life within the dove why because it was born a dove when you and i are born again there's a life inside of us by what by birth by what incorruptible seed and inside that life is the life of god it is god do you believe that it's the life of god it's the spirit of god and we're oiled from the inside out i don't need to go to church to get my next fix i go to church because something inside me pulls me to church i love the word because something inside me loves to worry i shall i meant because something inside me shouts amen but there's got to be something from the inside coming out when things get worse and there is no church to come to what will keep us then if things get bad and we get scattered to the winds what will keep us then it's got to be the thing that's keeping us now say god i don't want to be i don't want to be a crow amen but i want to be a dove let's all stand we'll just stop right there brother bam tells the story about a little spring musicians you can come little spring he tells ego visit this little spring and he said it was always bubbling winter summer it was always bubbling cool fresh clean water and he asked a little spring he said if i could talk and the spring could talk i'd say spring what makes you so happy because the deer come he said if that spring could talk he said the deer the spring would say no not because the deer come he said what what what is it is it because i come said no i appreciate that but not because you come but it's not me bubbling it's something behind me pushing me bubbling up you know and jesus when he talked to the woman at the well he asked her for a drink and and she was confused he's talking natural but she said if he says if you knew who i was you'd ask for me a drink and this water that i give to you would be water life springing up a well of water a well of water springing up into eternal life springing up into eternal life springing means leaping or gushing up see that woman was already a well and within her was already the water but it needed to spring up it needed to gush out he said i am needs to go by samaria why there was a well that needed doug in the days of abraham he dug wells but when abraham died it says the philistines covered in filled in the wells that abraham and doug but it said isaac the promised son he come by and his servants to dig out the wells that his father abraham had dug why because isaac knew there was a well right there my father had already put a well right there there's water there it looks like sand it looks like dirt but there's a well there and it said isaac's servants they began to dig in the valley and when they dig they said we found a well of springing water living water jumping when did it become alive it was always springing water it was just covered over amen and the father knows where the wells are amen and his son now the great holy ghost the son of god is moving here and he's using his servants to dig out wells so that the water can spring out again amen we didn't put any water there the water was already there there just had to be some digging take place to let it flow and when jesus went to samaria amen there was already a well of water there he went to a well but he was looking for a well a well that his father had planted a well that his father knew was there and all he had to do was do a little digging move a little rubble you've had you've had six husbands five husbands and the one you're with now is not your own what's he doing he's just uncovering the well [Applause] and she began to spring forth and ran into the village and told them all see friends he wasn't putting no water there the water was there not putting any oil in the dove the oil's coming out of the dove not putting life in the seed life's already in the seed but the life has to come and spark it to life quicken it but the life's already there it's a germatized seed eternal life is already there so life is coming to awaken life the seed is coming sea life is coming to bring life out of the seed it's already there the water is already there but the philistines have covered it over worldly influences and demon powers have covered it over but maybe let the servants of the promised son do a little digging and get rid of a little dirt of the world and say quit being so tied into sports and worldly entertainment let's throw that off quit being so tied into the fashions of the world drop all this noiseless chatter on our social media stop all the nonsense of foolishness that's being passed around let's just dig a little bit and see if there's some water there let the servants of of isaac dig around a little bit and say guess what i found springing water gushing out living fresh and flowing all the time you know when the rubble was taken off and it was dug out isaac didn't have to do anything to start it he didn't have to do anything to get it flowing all they had to do was move the world out of the way and when the world was moved out of the way it sprang up and kept springing friends because there was a power down behind it way down deep that was pushing it out why do you bubble is it because i come to you no why you vote because the d is no because there's something behind me pushing me why are you springing up why are you joyful in the midst of a trial why are you happy when the world is scared and in chaos why are you so joyful because there's something behind me pushing me up why when you're sitting at home with an extra 15 gigs you're not watching movies why because there's something in me there's an oil coming from the inside out it's not outside in i've missed fellowship i've been separated from my brothers amen i can't even go to work but there's still something from the inside coming out praise be to god friends we want our resurrection we gotta die we gotta die and let the servants dig out the well get all the dirt out of the way and die if you say i realize today i still have the nature of a crow that i still have an appetite for dead stuff now is the time to say lord let me die i want to die let me die lord take it out of me god i don't want an appetite for anything of the world i don't want an appetite for worldly things for worldly entertainment for lust i don't want i don't want an appetite for that but i want an appetite for only your good grain where i feed daily on your grain and i'm so hungry for more grain that i can't wait to get back it's time to die so that this could be your resurrection let's pray lord jesus we thank you father for the goodness you've given to us we thank you for your good word lord and the instructions you give us out of your word to take all the confusion away about what the real life is where it comes from how it acts god i pray that all denominational thinking would be smashed right now every idea lord of of a certain experience or a certain manifestation let it all be smashed right now every old pentecostal denominational idea that's moved over let it all fade away but lord let us come to the realization that we have to have a birth that that seed that you've planted inside of us so long ago has to be quickened to life and that life has to take over god there's many no doubt that are repenting lord wanting to die of an old crow nature lord and have all that desire just destroyed i pray god that you would let them be planted in the likeness of your death right here this morning lord wherever they may be but at this time let them be planted let the their life be planted in the likeness of your death that they may come forth in the likeness of your resurrection may their flesh be crucified with you lord that they may live with you also i pray that you send the quickening power in jesus name lord by the preaching of the word that your holy ghost power would come and quicken every seed gene to life that you would quicken them that you would spark off the life that there would be a fiery experience where something would happen that changes them and they know it lord that they know something shifted in my heart something changed something died and something came alive and i pray god that that life would guide them from now on let your oil lord flow from the inside out and keep us clean god in these hours that are confusing strange odd i pray god that we would flourish that we would prosper in your word that we would prosper in our experience with you in our walk with you lord that you would feed us your doves lord we pray let us have an appetite for your grain and only for your grain oh we love you god and we ask that you would bless us lord and help us to serve you in jesus christ's name we pray be with each one lord let this be a resurrection day for many god let us who have been resurrected let us grow lord under the brooding of your spirit let us bring forth greater fruit than we ever have in our lives for you've already pre-programmed us for it it's already in our genetic code lord let us lay in the presence of your son lord and let it draw all the life out of the seed that we might live to the full potential you have for us in this day we love you bless your people bless the families bless those that couldn't be here lord bless and anoint those lord that are still feeling the effects of sickness in their body i pray that you'd quicken them to health lord that you would strengthen them supernaturally and quicken the healing process in their bodies god bless us as your children and help us to grow through every circumstance we face in life in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] your spirit [Music] consume me lord and make me more like break me lord and bless the broken pieces of my [Music] [Music] by the fire of your spirits and make me more likely to [Music] the break faces of my life [Music] one more time [Music] me and make me more [Music] broken pieces of my life [Music] praise the i'll lord you a question what church did abraham go to to get strength for his journey who did abraham lean on in times of trouble what church did noah go to to get instructions on how to do what god had asked him to do [Music] what church did isaac go to after abraham died to find out how to live in the land see abraham had to separate from everything else because he found out all the things that he was leaning on and was leaning on him was holding him back he had to get alone with god [Music] see we don't need a new church a new camp another experience we just need to come to life we just need the seat on the inside to be sprung to life we just need him we just need to meet the mate the male and the female just need to come together to quicken the seed on the inside and now life is growing on the inside there needs to be an impregnation you know we're coming back to the time we come to church we love to come to church we should come to church that's not the problem it's not what i mean but look through the bible who did they have they had god who kept abraham strong god who kept isaac strong god who kept jacob strong god who did they have god it was a personal relationship with the personal god they were the seed of god responding to the move of god you see friends at this time if we get separated from one another can't have church like we should or even if they shut streaming down if somehow the internet collapses tomorrow and every infrastructure falls apart will you lose your experience will you have a hard time overcoming temptation or trial will you fall away because there's nobody to keep me strong see if that's the place we're in we need a we need an experience with god and maybe some of these things are coming our way to give us an opportunity and if i have unraveled your christianity today then i'm not apologizing if i've made you feel uncertain and unsecure and unsure unsure i'm not apologizing for that because your security can't come from anything else than your connection with christ himself you have got to know you've met the bridegroom you have got to know you've went into the inner chamber you have to know you've had the experience with your mate and it's quick and something in life without that there's no sure foundation there's no solid rock to stand on [Music] and if i have upset your apple cart i'm not going to apologize because it needed upsets we've got to get to they have the experience that says i know who i am and i know who i belong to i know who my king and my god are my saviors and i know him and he knows me and i know how to contact him when i need to contact him and i know how to hear from him when he's ready to speak to me that's the thing that matters most that's the foundation i would go back and check friends if there's anything we're checking right now check that foundation i know who my maker is i know who my redeemer is i've met him personally i know he hears me and i know that i have the capacity to hear from him when he chooses to speak i can hear when he decides to move me i can move this isn't the hour for pretend christians this isn't the site we're not moving into the cycle where we play church and come to church and house is full and the worship is great and i feel good and as long as all that's going i can live an overcoming life we're past that those days are done god's going to smash that we've got to be the kind of believer if i get cut out of the herd and separated and i'm all by myself wandering in the wilderness just me and my family we'll still be believers we'll still serve god we'll still believe this message will still stand in holiness and righteousness because it's not me it's not a life i'm living it's a life he's come in and is living through me whatever life was in that seat when it sprung to life it's taken over friends and nothing's going to stop that life breaking my fellowship i'll still have that life break break the church i still have that life lose my job i'll still have that life the government completely breaks down i'll still have that life it may not be easy there may be struggles but that's the part we have that's the place we have to be in this hour let's die if we're not there yet die throw yourself fresh on the altar [Music] a stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands [Music] everything that it falls on is grounding the power and blowed like the chaff of the wind but everything that falls on it is broken to pieces why don't you just if you've not done so yet why don't you just throw yourself down on that stone and say lord break me to bits just shatter me lord and let that life in me reform me according to that life that's on the inside i want to i want to be just as true as abraham was [Music] when david was chased away and lived in a cave he was still true to you i want to be true to you when the apostle paul was separated and put in prison his testimony diminished not one drop that's the life i want on that all alone and in isolation with nobody looking i still want to be pure i still want to be pure when i'm all by myself and there's not a soul watching me and not one person will ever know what i'm going to do next i still want oil to come from the inside out and keep me clean remember brother biscuit's testimony when he talks about chris that little norwegian or swedish man that brother branham loved so much they were hunting on a hunting trip and he was laying sleeping and and brother branham was looking at him and brother biscuit walked in the tent and he saw him
