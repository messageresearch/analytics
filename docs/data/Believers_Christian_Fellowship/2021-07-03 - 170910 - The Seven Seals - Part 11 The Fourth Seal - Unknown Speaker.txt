========================================

let's turn what we're standing to the book of daniel chapter 12. you know we live in an amazing time the west coast is burning up by fires we've had a hurricane that hit texas that left the worst flooding in u.s history and if you're paying close attention to the news there's something that you keep hearing over and over again the worst unprecedented never before not in 100 years i mean it's like how many records can we break it's every catastrophe breaks a record every disaster breaks a record because it's birth pains friends you know and these birth pains began after the seals were opened brother branham goes back out west and he and he picks up a stone according to the commandment of the lord and he throws it in the air and when it does he he prophesies that there's judgment coming and and it starts a whirlwind that goes up and there's a there's an earthquake amen that hits alaska and that was the first shock of birth pains and instilled on record as the the largest earthquake ever recorded in in the history of man on this earth and and so so now that started birth pains and from there they start coming in greater intensity and closer frequency greater intensity and closer frequency and for 50 some years 52 years now we've been watching the birth pains increasing and now we come to a place where the contractions are continuous and they're more intense than they've ever been before what is it this earth is about to birth forth a millennium it's about to renovate amen for the honeymoot period of the bride and groom and and the the baby's coming the baby's coming everything that you see in the news is telling you it's coming amen we're going to meet the lord in the air and this earth is going to be renovated for the honeymoon period and that's what the news is telling you amen that's what the newspaper articles and the and the news reports they're telling you that birth pains are continuous the contractions are are off the off the charts off the scales and they're coming every few minutes and i say it's going home time we know what time we live in well you know harvey produced the worst flooding in u.s history and and now they said this that this hurricane now irma was the strongest ever recorded in the atlantic outside the caribbean and had the longest sustained 185 mile an hour is the worst everything's the worst because we've come to birth pains and i say god make me ready for that meeting in the air let's look at daniel we're going to continue on in the seals today i'm going to look at the fourth seal by the grace of god let's look at daniel chapter 12. we've read this several times but i want to keep this fresh in our memory as we go through this you have to excuse me i'm i'm fighting lying vanities this morning and they're nothing but lying vanities and uh it's almost like the the devil didn't like camp but i don't care what he liked and what he didn't like and i don't care what he tries to do to punish afterwards i liked it and i'm going to keep liking it and today's is going to be a continuation of the same amen rejoicing in the word of god i don't care what he does amen nail me to a cross i don't care you can't take away this joy in my heart you can't take away my victory amen you can't steal back the ground that i have gained amen verse 8 daniel 12 and 8. and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so we know that this prophecy has been sealed until the time of the end so when we see the time of the unsealing of this then we know we're at the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicket shall understand but the wise shall understand how many want to understand it makes you part of the wise let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord for this word we just pray now lord as we look into your word that you would open it to us lord we can read words on paper but that doesn't mean much lord if you don't come and reveal it to us by your own supernatural presence lord it's just words on paper it's just it's just something that was pinned long ago but the lord it's more than that to us lord and by your revelation you've made it more than that to us and i pray god that you would just reveal it to us today open our our eyes of understanding equip us lord and strengthen us by your word we give you preeminence in this place and ask that you would take this vessel and use it for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated let's turn to the book of revelation chapter 5. excuse me so that we know in daniel daniel saw something and and he wanted to know what all these things were but he was told that it was sealed up until the time of the end so we get to the book of revelation which is the last book of the bible and we're gonna see where this is unsealed let's look at chapter five verse one revelation chapter five verse one and i saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne so this book was a sealed book and these things were sealed up till the time of the end then at the time of the end we see that that that the title deed of redemption the ownership of all creation is placed back in the hands of god but god never had to write himself a title deed because god's the creator of everything he's the originator of it he doesn't need a title deed amen he doesn't need a document to document his ownership he's owner because he created he's the ultimate owner amen so he doesn't need a document he doesn't need anybody to witness it he's the one who created everything if there's a witness he created the witness so it all belongs to him so this book in his hand is not for him he's just holding it until somebody can fulfill the right of redemption the kinsmen redeemer and take the book out of his hand because he originally gave it to man in the garden of eden he gave it to adam to be god over the earth to have dominion over all the earth and he was he was placed on the earth as the god of the creation amen but when he fell by disbelieving and disobeying the word of god when he fell by his disobedience to the word then he lost the rights to be god upon the earth and now that title deed went from his hands back to the original owner and satan tried to grab it but his dirty hands couldn't hold it is what is what the word tells us his dirty hands could not hold that so it went back to god so now we see him here holding this book but he's not holding it for himself he's not opening it and reading it he knows what's in it amen he has the book is not for him amen the book is for a man the book is for his children his sons amen and so now he has to wait until one of them comes in a condition that's able to pay the price of redemption to buy back claims and rights to take that book and so here we see him in revelations chapter 5 he's able now to come forth as the lamb that had been slain having lived a perfect life fulfilling all the law of god and now he has rights to claim redemption claims and he goes and he has a right to take the book out of the hand of him who holds it this is amazing nobody can come there unworthy nobody can come be so bold as to walk up and take from god that book but this was god in flesh this was the flesh man of god and he lived a perfect life and he died so that he had rights when when his time of kinsmen redeemer work is over now it's time for him to come and claim what he has been redeeming now he's able to come forth and take the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne oh praise god that reminds me of another taking of the book see john when they when the mighty angel called who is worthy to come and take the book and loose the seals john began to weep because nobody in heaven or on earth and under the earth nowhere was there anybody found worthy to take that book and john must have realized that if nobody can open this book all claims to creation are lost that means the squatter gets to remain on the earth as king as the prince of the power of the air the god of this evil age and so john just couldn't bear to see that satan would win over over the word of god that satan would be the victor over the children of god but yet now there's one that can come and take it but nobody else in heaven nobody else on earth nobody else under the earth could touch the book or even look at it but we see something else take place in revelations chapter 10. and in revelations chapter 10 we see this mighty angel come down with an open book in his hand not a sealed book he's already opened the seals amen he's already revealed it through the seventh church age messenger and now he comes with an open book in his hand in this same book that nobody was worthy to touch nobody was worthy even to look therein now he makes a cry to john and says go and take the book out of the hand of the mighty angel oh my goodness something had changed from revelation 5 to revelation 10 there is a significant change that takes place now uh a man amen who is who was born in sin shaped an iniquity one who came in a hybrid condition who's not worthy before to look at the book to touch the book or even look there on now he's told to go and take the book from the angel this is what redemption has done for you and i the thing that we've forbidden to even look upon the thing that was sealed to daniel he said daniel it's sealed go thy way amen are revealed at the end now it comes to a place where you're told now to take the book and john walks up to the mighty angel and he says give me oh he doesn't say please he doesn't say if you may oh if if you're not too upset with me he knows now that he has rights to the book john was standing there john was watching the scene in revelation 5 when nobody was worthy john was there and he wasn't worthy and he was weeping because he wasn't worthy no one was worthy nobody could take this book but now the same john who was not worthy to take it when the lamb takes the book and loses the seals now john's told to go to the angel and he walks up to the angel when john was weeping before because he couldn't now he goes up and says give me the book hallelujah you're taking these redemption claims taking this word back into yourself you don't have to beg you don't have to ask pretty please it's been given to you it is yours to take you need to go boldly amen and take it amen not timid not oh if you could only oh if you could just have mercy on me oh if you could please god i'm a worthy i'm a worthless oh you you've always been worthless you were just as worthless as john was worthless in revelation 5. he couldn't do it either it had nothing to do with john's merit had everything to do with the lamb and because the lamb took the book the lamb overcame the lamb opened the seals now john in a hybrid condition can go and take the book and eat the book and prophesy again oh friends we don't have to beg if we're children of god we can come to that mighty angel which is christ and say give me the revelation of this book give me the understanding that you've promised you told daniel to shut up to the time of the end but you've unleashed it now at the end and it's open and you said that john could go and take the book if john could take the book i can take the book if john could eat the book i can eat the book lord give me amen when when when caleb came into his inheritance he was already told that there was a portion for him he was already told what he would get when he comes into the land so when he comes now to joshua which is a type of the holy ghost he comes up now and he says give me my mountain he doesn't say could i please have or could we talk about this could we negotiate for a little while he was already told it was his he was already told that he could possess it and now when the time comes he doesn't ask he commands give me my mountain and this word is your mountain friends it's been given to you we have to take it we have to it has to be precious to us it has to be worth something to us we have to be able to go in contact with the mighty angel himself and say give me the book lord reveal to me what you've promised to reveal open my eyes to see your plan of redemption because you promised it it's for me i come to take the book hallelujah can we open up the powerpoint please praise the lord so we want to look at the fourth seal and we'll do a quick recap so we all stay on the same page but we see we've got a sealed document and here let's go to revelation chapter 6. i don't i don't believe we could ever go over this enough it's like every time we read through it it gets richer i've been so fascinated with the book of revelation over the last maybe year maybe six months to a year i just keep reading through it and reading through it and reading through it because this is the capstone of the bible this is the revelation of jesus christ amen this is this is capping off the entire word it's just a thrill to me to read it revelation 6 and 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the four the voice of the fourth be say come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with them and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth amen that's our fourth seal now we find that as the lamb is breaking the seals back here when when john's having the vision when he's breaking the seals he's only showing it in a symbol form we're only seeing a white horse that goes out amen and he was given a crown and he had a bow with no arrows and we see to combat him the beast that was to announce it was the the lion because that was the one that was mentioned first before in revelation 4 around the throne the lion and and then comes the red horse and then comes the ox and and it's all symbology we're seeing the symbols of what this means but yet we're not having the clear understanding of what it represents only the symbology so we go over to revelations 10 let's read this together in revelations 10 10 and 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left put upon the earth he's taking complete dominion over creation right foot upon the land and left foot upon the earth right foot on the sea left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice is when a lion roareth when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so we find the pattern in scripture we have a sealed book and then the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals but yet because it was not the end of the at the end of time when john saw this vision it wasn't time for these things to be revealed yet he could only break the seal in symbolic form so you could see a white horse and a lion and you could see a red horse and an ox and you could see all these symbols so that it would be in the word because we know once this word is sealed at the end that you cannot add one word or take one word from it but yet these things had to be sealed up till the time of the end so there's got to be at the very end of time there's got to be a a prophet that will come on the scene and break the revelation of what daniel wanted to understand what was sealed until the time of the end so now it's got to lay down in symbol form so that the prophet can come and preach out of the scriptures because we can't add the word he said don't add to or take away from the words of this prophecy so it's got to be laying in there so he reveals it in symbol form but then when the mighty angel comes down with the open book he utters seven thunders there's voices of seven thunders and it's the revelation of what the symbols were and john was told in the beginning of the book everything which you see write down so as soon as we get there john decides he's going to keep doing what he's been doing he's going to write down what the seven thunders had uttered and he begins to write he's told don't write it now we see what was revealed sealed again so the thunders become the second set of seals amen the seals on the back side of the book the it was unsealed in in symbol form but then when it was revealed in the thunders it was sealed again but then when brother branham would come amen by commissioned by an angels to come back and preach the seven thunders because that's what the seven seals was was the preaching of the seven thunders and he came and he preached each one of those seals what the symbol mean and he broke it down through the scriptures and that was the voice of the seven thunders amen he was breaking the seals on the backside of the book it was the lamb who broke the seals every day an angel would come to him every day and give him the revelation of what the symbolic meaning was and that was the preaching of the seven thunders and after that verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it in my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings so we have a daniel who wants to see something but it's sealed then we see the sealed book in revelation 5 and the hand of sin unto him that sits on the throne then the lamb takes it and breaks it in symbol for him then the thunders come and he's told not to not to write what the thunder said but then we have a prophet and the last day comes and he tells us what john heard what john saw and now the book has been opened and then when the book is open you can take it and eat it the breach between the seven churches and the seven seals the prophet says it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to you out of the book the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of god should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age the last church age all the loose ends that through these church ages had been probed at will be wound up together and when the seals are broken the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember the seventh angels on earth at the time of this coming i love this quote what does this tell you christ is here the mighty angel has come down amen christ is here hallelujah hallelujah that means everything to us you can't be married in the invisible union unless he's here amen you can't be united to christ unless he's here amen but he's here not in a measure he's in a full portion he's here he's hearing the fullness of his word with the full spirit that comes with it he's here not in corporal body but but he was there he was alive before there was a corporal body he was in existence before there was a baby born in a manger he was there amen whatever form he was there and he was there and then he made himself a body to dwell in and though that body remains sitting up there as a memorial for atonement he has come himself amen that's why we're not married to a prophet we're not joined amen to eliezer we've been united to isaac amen to the son that's why we're now married in the invisible union amen of the bride we're united with him in the visible union but soon and very soon we're going to be united in the visible union amen and the meeting in the air and going to the marriage supper of the lamb hallelujah this means everything to us this means your husband is here you can be married to him now we don't have to wait for something else to happen he's here now and he's come here to join himself with the bride hallelujah in the breach again he says the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals and being it's on the back side is because it's wound up the seal mysteries on the inside and only says the white horse rider or the black horse rider and whatever more on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from genesis to revelations a complete plan of redemption is revealed in those seven seals hallelujah and the seals are open hallelujah i love to declare that and the seals are open if they weren't open then the mighty angel couldn't come down if they weren't open you couldn't take the book and eat it they weren't open the seven thunders couldn't be revealed if they weren't open then you can't be married to christ they have to be open friends we want to take a look at two vines satan in christ this is very important because this is the narrative that this is the battle that we're caught and this is the narrative that we've come to understand said the the greatest battle ever fought this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started and the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven so we've got to be careful when we start talking about original sin we've got to be careful because original sin did not originate in the garden of eden that's only when it originated with man but amen original sin originated in heaven there was sin in heaven before there was sin on earth so the original sin is in heaven and the original center is lucifer that's important to know because you have to know who your enemy is amen and it's important to know that the original center was lucifer because brother branham tells us that when we come to the true atonement amen the atonement the blood of jesus christ is like clorox bleach amen and he said you can take a drop of black ink and drop it in the bleach and it'll send it right back to its original elements and he said now when you come through the the clorox bleach of the blood of jesus christ it takes your sin and it puts it back on the originator of sin which is satan himself you don't know how wonderful that is maybe you do but it's going to get more wonderful with time because we realize i i just i'm just going to divert for just a few minutes here and say you realize now when a sinner goes down with his sin when he comes up at the judgment he comes up with his sin and then he must stand judgment for the sins that he went down with he comes up and he faces judgment for his own wrong but when a child of god who's come through the atonement when he goes when he goes if he goes through the grave he comes forth in the resurrection and the first resurrection and he doesn't even go to the judgment because he has no sin but the way the prophet taught us amen it's not that your sin vanishes away and is no more your sin has been removed from you as far as the east is from your west but the sin remains because god is not the kind of judge that overlooks things god doesn't overlook anything amen god is a righteous god and his law if there's a if there's no penalty then there's no law and there's a penalty for his law and every infraction of the law must be penalized or else he's not a just god it means he's not god if he doesn't give a just penalty for every crime so he cannot just vanish your sin away and make it disappear he can't do that but what he does is he removes it from you and he puts it back to the originator of sin and now all of your sin rests on the shoulders of satan himself and in the judgment he's going to stand judgment for everything he tricked you into doing because you never sinned in the first place you come from god you're not a sinner and when you're born again by the spirit of god you've come back to your virgin condition just as if you've never done it because in the beginning you didn't do it in the beginning he did it and he's going to have to pay and the only people on this planet that is making him pay for his crimes are those who come through the atonement you see god needs you on this earth you say why did god let me fail and why did i come to this condition and why until i was 40 years old did i hear the truth why not as a baby because the only people that are going to make lucifer stand for his crimes are those that have come through the atonement and the sins that was on them that he tricked them into he is going to have to answer in the day of judgment for so why did god let it happen so he has something to judge the serpent form that should make you happy all those mistakes the things that make you cringe the things that you're so ashamed of when you think about it don't be ashamed anymore because god has erased it from your record it's just as if you have never done it in the mind of god you never have done it but who did it he did it and he's going to answer for it he's going to stand at the day of judgment and everything he's accused you for remember in the book of esther haman hung on his own gallows and in the day of judgment amen when the queen is sitting with the king amen this haman is going to hang on his own gallows the ones he built to take down the children of god is going to be the very thing that takes him down i love that friends so now why did god let bad things happen god knows what's happening he's not afraid because he knows what's on the inside god's not god's not pleased with sin he's not enjoying the sin but he knows that there's a seed on the inside and he knows all i have to do is in the right time all i've got to do is get light to that seed and it'll come forth in newness of life and they'll come to the true atonement which in this day is the word and they'll come to the true atonement for their day and i will strip all that off of their record and it will be transferred to the record of lucifer himself why does he fight you why does he hate you because you're you're going to make sure he gets punished and you're the only ones on the planet that are going to make sure he gets punished i like that thought amen those things that make you shudder when you think about them in the past when satan gives you a flashback of something that you had did that was horrible and that you regret so bad when you shudder just remember on the day of judgment i'm not going to be the one shuddering i'm not going to be the one ashamed he's going to be the one who's shaking he's going to be the one shuddering because he did it in the first place i didn't god's taking us by the new birth back to our original condition and my original condition is perfectly sinless and whole hallelujah so sin did not originate on earth that originated in heaven and it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles so think about this what battle are you fighting that what was started in the heavens amen when lucifer rebelled against god and deceived a third of the angels and war broke out in heaven that battle has moved down into eden and it moved from angelic from from angels and it became human battles this is the same war you're fighting in the same war that broke out in heaven not a different war not a second war you're fighting in the same war because it started there and it spilled down into this creation and now it become human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what this purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since when the battle moved to earth and we say it moved to eden it didn't move to just eden in general it came down to eden and the battle went one place it went to the woman and he began to reason with her and began to entice her and begin to seduce her and then the battle began in her and now the battle came from heaven and it came down to earth but it's not as though the battle has fallen all over the face of the earth the battle is in us that makes it awful close to home doesn't it don't forget you've been placed here to overcome you've been put here to defeat the devil it says in the seventh seal it's an old battle that started way back beyond time and when satan and his angels was kicked out and they come to earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word we'll stop right there what did satan win the battle over god's word what's the whole what's the whole war over god's word if lucifer rebelled what did he rebel against he rebelled against god's word amen you can't have rebellion unless you're rebelling against the commandment if there's no commandment there's no rebellion so he's rebelling against the word of god and the battle amen is not over you the figure you see in the mirror the battle is over the word that you contain within you amen and as long as he could get the woman to let down on the word satan won the battle over the word amen because he broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word now this is going to get really close to home now so now the battle that was raging in heaven came down to earth and the battle come in us right and he said when one of his subjects let down the bar on the word satan had victory over the word of god and as long as one subject i'm going to ask you how many of the attributes of god does satan have to defeat to defeat god one satan only has to defeat one attribute of god to defeat god and if god has portioned himself out in this age and he's placed himself out as sons and daughters of god all he has to do is overcome one of those attributes and he's overcome god and when one of his subjects with that word inside of them the word of life when they let down on the word satan again has victory over the word of god and that's why he sits as a squatter on this earth and that why that's exactly why he is the god of this evil age is because one subject let down on brother brenham said one word just added one word surely and because of that addition of one word amen the the the the satan won the victory over the word of god and brother bram said how do you think you're going to get back doubting one word let down on one word how are you going to get back how are you going to get back doubting one word that's why the seals have been opened that's why the word has been restored because this bride is not supposed to be in deception anymore she's not supposed to be misunderstanding the word but the word has been restored so that she can believe the word and in faith in the full word of god when you get all of those subjects brother baby said when you get all of them together in one place what's it going to be then he doesn't mean one place like albuquerque new mexico or one place like new york he means one place in the revelation of the word when this bride gets to one place in the revelation of the word what's it going to be then it's going to be the very thing that overcomes satan and so now we realize that the whole battle in heaven and the whole battle that's spelled out on earth the whole war between satan and the word of god comes down to one person me you when one of the subjects let down on one word one subject let down on one word satan had the victory over the word of god but god is determined there's going to come a time there will not be one subject let down on one word that's why he sent his word and with the word came the full life of jesus christ to back it up amen and we've got to get to the place where we receive the word and receive the word and trash our own thinking and forget about our own ideas and just keep feeding on the word and let the revelation comes and the life of it to live itself out until there's no more deception in the bride that she's not falling by lucifer's deception she's not falling by her own thinking but she's standing on thus saith the lord she has the word and just dust said the lord or she keeps still that's what we're coming to and that's the thing that will defeat satan not when you get a little bit happier and not not when you run around some more not when you get more excited but when you come to the full manifestation of the full word when that life of jesus christ is on full display and there's no more letting down on the word there's no more compromising with the world there's no more letting down on the word then we're going to have absolute victory over the enemy and there's a people coming to that brother bam said that's gonna shave you down a lot he said it shaves me down a lot but we need shaved down a lot because we're coming to what the image of jesus christ on the earth again and jesus christ was not a compromiser with the word he wasn't a disbeliever of the word he wasn't playing games with the word of god but he was completely sold out to the will of god he was led by the spirit of god completely he had thus saith the lord or he kept still and we're coming to the same thing oh my we sit here and we think how that rules me out that doesn't rule you out because it's not you that does it friends amen it's just like it's just like whenever we go down this path it's nothing but the enemy that would take us and say well that rules me out i can't overcome if it was based on you overcoming we'd all be in trouble because you can't overcome you can't defeat the devil you can't in your own flesh when amen it's got to be something that god does through you amen it's receiving the spirit and brother bannon said the word and the spirit are the self same thing that's why the word was restored that's why you've got 1200 tapes that's why you've got the opening of the seals is so that you can receive what you have need of to have victory in this day it's not you it's him but how are we going to get there with sunday wednesday only how are we going to get there amen if we're not hungry for the word of god if we have no prayer life to find out what he wants us to do with the word if we have no communion with the lord remember brother branham come and it was the voice of the seventh angel in the days of the voice of the seventh angel so if you just look at the recorded messages because that's the voice that's what was left it starts with the foundation of faith in 1947 the first recorded sermon we have is faith is the substance where does it end 1965 communion the message is to bring you from the foundation of faith to communion with god it's not you it's the word that's been restored that's why we become one with the word that's why we eat the book it's not your efforts it's not your willpower it's not your strength it has nothing to do with you it has everything to do with him all we can do is surrender i'm so glad he's not depending on me to overcome because i would make a big mess of it but he's going to do this himself that's why the mighty angel came down amen praise the lord let's get a little further i just feel like i want to kill that demon forever because the minute we start talking about full life of jesus christ and the very minute he becomes what comes to you whispering here you'll never make it you're not going to be good enough you don't have the power to overcome that's a lying devil that's the hiss of the serpent that has nothing to do with the scriptures you'll never find that in the word of god it has nothing to do with the word of god it is nothing but a lie because when we go down that path the very thing that we're doing is we're rejecting the atonement and that's what satan wants us to do is reject the atonement as if the lamb wasn't enough as if the blood of god being shed through jesus christ was wanted not enough to erase you of all sin and all guilt and make you spotless and virtuous and pure the virgin bride of jesus christ as if you had to add something to it see but that's exactly the lie you're beginning to believe when you go down and say well i can i never will and i never he you already have friends because you were with him when he was mailed to the cross you've already paid for all your crimes you already have overcome when when you were in him amen you were crucified with him amen and you have already paid you have already overcome that's nothing but a devil whispering in your ear and he's lying and he's trying to get you to lose confidence in the atonement brother brahm said he's not looking at you he only hears your voice coming through the blood he's looking at the lamb but all the devil wants you to do is look at you but god's not looking at you but the devil wants you to look at you but i'm not looking at me i'm looking at the lamb he was enough and if he's been restored in this day it's enough and if i've received the baptism of the holy ghost it's enough it's going to overcome my job now is just to crucify myself my my task is to lay my life down that's where my labors are that's where my work is is to die and to get up in the morning and die and an hour later die and five minutes later die again and keep dying and keep giving up and keep surrendering that's where all my work is but it's all every every bit of overcoming is going to be what he does right through me remember the battle is in you hallelujah it moved from heaven now it's in you praise the lord so we want to look at the battle plan this is how lucifer works he comes in as a white horse and he begins in compromise remember the white horse it looks like christ but it's not christ it looks innocent but it's not innocent and we see it's compromise it's a slight change from the word and it looks good it doesn't look bad satan never shows up and knocks on your door and says i got some heroin here you want to become an addict today it doesn't happen that way he comes in and it looks good and it looks like a good thing it looks like it'll be beneficial and he always starts that way but remember he has no crown he's given a crown and he has a bow with no arrows he can do you no harm amen this is the place where you stop him why was god so happy with phineas or phineas or however you say his name remember when balaam tricked them amen and he deceived he taught balak how to cast the stumbling stone before israel and he deceived them into joining together in the feast of baal piar and and they began to mingle together and they began the israelites began to mix amen mixing's always been a deadly thing god has always hated mixing him he hated it when the serpent mixed with the woman and he's hated mixing ever since and so now on this feast of baal pr he teaches them the mix amen they're mixing the religion and now now now the sons of god start to take the the moabite daughters and and the israelites take them and they come into their tent and finesse didn't wait for a council he didn't wait amen he didn't wait for a couple weeks to see how he felt about it later he picked up a javelin he ran into the tent and he thrust them through the men and the woman together and god loved it god wasn't angry about that god loved it why finesse when he saw it he acted the minute he saw it he killed it we need some daddies like that at home we need some mommies like that at home when they see it they kill it amen throw a javelin through that thing and don't be afraid to kill it because it starts off white and innocent and it and it comes in and you're like i don't know is it really harmful hey if you're in doubt throw it out if there's a question don't move forward because that which is done without faith is sin we need some mommies and daddies that'll throw the javelin the first time they see it and not wait and see what happens or see what this monster becomes down the road because once it's in it's a lot harder to get out than it is to stop it at the gate hallelujah so he looks good and he comes in through deception and comes in with just a slight compromise then he moves on but god sent a beast to combat the white horse and the beast that he sent was the lion and the lion is the pure word of god amen in the first age it was the apostle paul's teaching which became most of the new testament and then we see next he comes with the red horse now we recognize that this horse rider we've been through this i'm just doing a review this horse rider he doesn't want to stay on the white horse right he has no desire to stay on the white horse the white horse is just his entry point into your life but once he moves gets in there with the white horse he wants to change horses amen his plan is to get to the fourth horse which we'll talk about today that's been his desire all along as to get to the fourth horse and this red horse takes peace brings war and his killing he has a sword you'll find out that as soon as compromise comes into your life it'll begin to create war in your relationships it'll begin to take your peace from your own spirit and things get all warlike inside but god sent something to battle the red horse and that was the ox oh hallelujah the ox is self-sacrifice the ox is dying to yourself amen bearing burdens and giving up your rights see laodicea's people's rights but you know what i'm happy to give mine up i'm happy to give all my rights up because for the glory that lay ahead i'll endure whatever cross that the lord has for me for the glory that lays ahead we see that the third seal and the third beast or the third horse is the black horse and this is spiritual control and you see these moving down through the church ages and brother branham shows us back down the church ages and shows how each one of these horse riders came and how they deceived the church and the condition that it got in and they come into complete spiritual control through the spirit of nicolaitanism the laity had no rights they had no word now is under complete control and dominance and it moved to the dark ages in a spiritual famine and friends if you stay with this horse rider long enough he will bring you to spiritual famine he will bring you to a dry place where your spiritual life is all dried up but praise be to god there's a solution when he come on the black horse god sent another beast anointing to combat that and it was the man anointing and he had the oil and the wine which is the holy spirit is the oil and the wine is the stimulation of revelation and he used a man for his intellect and his wisdom but it's not man's intellect and wisdom it's only symbolic of the wisdom of god that came the spiritual revelation of the word now let's get to the fourth seal let's just read that again if you're in revelation let's go to revelation 6 and we'll read that and pick up from here revelation 6 verse 7. now i'll warn you now this is a huge seal we'll not take our time today but we'll take our time over the next several weeks praise the lord amen but we're just going to stay on it as long as god opens it up to us and gives us something amen will stay with him we just want to introduce it today in verse 7 and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast saying come and see and what was that fourth beast it was an eagle a flying eagle and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with them and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and when the beasts of the earth so this is the first time that the horse rider is named and we find out that he's been coming changing horses amen and and once he changes off that horse that horse continues to ride brother branham says it rides on out but he changes so the white horse keeps riding he changes the red horse he goes to the black whereas the red horse keeps riding changes to the pale horse the black horse keeps writing these things don't leave they're still working in the church they're still working in our lives because the battle moved from heaven to earth in us that's why that's why we need to understand these things because the battle is right here friends so in the fourth seal right at the beginning right in the very beginning chap or paragraph three he says so happy to be back in the house of the lord tonight in service again i'm so happy just thought this one wouldn't come but it finally did and so i'm so thankful that being the last of those four horse riders which i think is one of the main messages to the church at this time so we're getting friends to the one of the main messages to the church at this time which is this fourth seal we'll find out that the four seal is the wrap up of everything in the church ages and the third series is now let's background this just a little bit on the seals that we have passed because just like in the church ages why we tried to give a background to kind of lap it over to you because that's the way the ages are actually in scripture one lapse the other one over just like that like climbing a ladder and or climbing a step rather one running down to the other and coming back like that as you go up a step so he's telling us these seals lap over one another when god moves he doesn't come down like he did in the church ages he doesn't come down as a meat cleaver and this one stops and this one starts but there's a little overlap between them and he said it's like going up steps so the seals are the same way this is important to know in the fourth seal because when we get to the fourth seal much of what happens in the fourth seal to the fourth horse rider happens in the tribulation period happens after the rapture of the saints but not all of it some of it happens now so it's like going up this ladder so we're going to look at that and see that as we go so the four fourth horse is the pale horse and here he's named a spiritual death the incarnate devil in the fourth seal says the fourth stage of the writer watched the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means eternal separation from god that's what death means to be eternal separated from god this is this is important this is the fourth seal this is what the horse rider is named now remember there's only two spirits at work in the world there's the true and the false amen there's satan in christ there's only two there's only ever been two that's why there's always twins through the bible amen when it was when it was it was time for children to come upon the earth you have cain and abel at the time of jesus you have judas and jesus you always have these twins that go all the way through the scriptures so we find out that there's only two spirits at work in the world today it's the antichrist spirit and the spirit of christ and so when the antichrist spirit rides out on these horses he goes from white to red to black to pale and when he gets to pale all of a sudden he's named because until you get to the eagle age there's a mystery who this is but the mystery is going to be solved in the eagle age when the eagle anointing comes which is a prophetic anointing the eagle anointing with eyes that can see afar off that can fly high and see he's going to look down and he's going to see and he's going to be able to say this is this and this is that and this is this why because he's the prophet of the age and so he comes down and he says this same writer who's been writing this is none other than death what is death death is the opposite of life so he's named his death only on the one of two spirits the antichrist spirit and the fourth seal he says no wonder he could impersonate himself in the persona personified name called death he sure was god only knowed how how many he calls to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching look at this cause to spiritually die this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed and probably literally billions died spiritually on his false teaching no wonder he could take the name of death there's only two ways death and life there's only two spirits the antichrist and the christ hallelujah like he give egypt he give egypt a place to repent what was the last plague was death that's the last plague that hit the pentecostal church it's spiritual death she's dead that's in the name of the lord she's spiritually dead he's not saying will be the prophet here is standing remember he's bridging the gap between two ages he comes at the end of the laodicean church age and he's bridging the gap to the bride age and he's now declaring that the pentecostal church is spiritually dead she's dead he said that's in the name of the lord she's spiritually dead he gave her place to repent and she rejected it now she's dead she'll never rise again that's why the atonement amen can only be found in the message of the hour because the the the pentecostal age amen that that pentecostal church that came out of the piccolo is dead is spiritually dead there's no life to be found there all of the denominational systems are dead it's under the pale horse but we've moved now into the eagle age where the eagle can now say the only one who could say is the eagle and the eagle standing here says it's dead there's a great secret we want to get to before we wrap up today just hang with me remember here see death is eternal separation remember saints don't die how many saints do we have in here that means you can't come to the fourth horse rider friend that means you cannot come to spiritual death because you you're not amen you're you're a child of god you can never come to death why because the seed inside you already has life and that seed can never come to death because it already has life oh this gets good they sleep not die he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life that's right shall not come into the judgment but is passed from death and to life i am the resurrection and life said jesus he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die lazarus dead he sleepeth fear not the girl is not dead but sleepeth they laughed him to scorn is that right oh my see saints don't die separation from god is death eternal death and this fellow is called death friends you can never be eternally separated from god because when god portioned the portion of himself out and dropped it in your soul amen brother brahma said you can no more be lost and god can be lost because god cannot lose himself you can never you're not in fear you don't have to tremble worrying about coming to this fourth horse rider you never will you're predestinated not to you'll never come to eternal separation from god god is here he's gathering you back to himself not sending you away but gathering you to himself hallelujah come to the eagle anointing and the eagle is god himself oh this is good i don't even know amen all right god himself the prophet prophets and the children of god this is the part that i want to leave this is what i wanted to open the door to how many times did you hear brother branham tell the story about the eagle egg under the chicken would you say this is a major story that he tells and a major theme of his ministry i think i would i would call that a major theme of his ministry it's something that he told i can't even tell you how many times i never even tried to look it up but it's got to be dozens and dozens of times he told this story now you have to ask yourself why is the prophet of the age so attracted to this story it's a parable friends he's bringing in the eagle age now remember the eagle is different than all the other beasts every one of those other beasts are land bound creatures the lion the ox the man every one of them start on milk every one of them nurse from their mother they're all they all live and they all they all live their life in their existence on the ground but the eagle's completely different the eagle amen is a heavenly bird a heavenly beast the eagle is built to fly not to stay but to go the eagle age has not come for us to stay but the eagle anointing has come for us to go it's the flying away anointing it's the leaving the earth anointing and the ego doesn't start on milk because we've had milk for two thousand years but the eagle comes and baby eagles start on meat they don't nurse milk but they come on the fresh kill of the word they're here to get the fresh manna from heaven amen and they just get a portion at a time as they grow but they start on meat amen that's what eagles are attracted to it's a different age it's a different time we've moved into the eagle annoying thing but here brother branham starts telling this story and and we i got a quote here let's read it but now when it comes forth to eagle age that's the one that god always likens his prophets to eagles he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes so high there ain't nothing else can touch him not only is he up there but he's built for that position when he gets up there he sees where he's at some people get up there and they can't see where they're at so don't do no good to get up there so you know you've got to be predestinated for it you've got to have the eyes to see and the ears to hear you've got to have everything in order to get up there if you're not built for it you'll just blow to pieces when you get up there that's why some people can walk so long in truth and they come so far but they eventually get so high they just blow to pieces or they get so high they can't see anymore and they get all confused where they're at and they just fly back down to the ground because you've got to be built to fly that high but listen he says the brother of him says god always likens his prophets to eagles and he calls himself an eagle this is going to get really important this eagle age anointing is to get the eagles that were hatched out in the chicken yard back to their original condition that's what this fourth seal is all about it's about to get get hey you know what you were you were the seed inside of you the genetics inside of your soul is is ego it's all ego amen it's nothing but ego but yet you hatched out on the down on this earth amen and you come into a barnyard and you're with all these other birds and and you're a bird you know you're a bird you know they're a bird and you're trying to fit in and it never works out how many times does he tell the story over and over and over again and that that little eagle's a misfit to all the other little chickens and he's earthbound he was never born to be on the earth my goodness if you look at his talons he can't even walk chickens will scratch scratch i mean i mean my goodness can you imagine seeing an eagle scratch in a manure pile they just flip a whole hunk over sometimes eagles talents are so long they've got the ball up their feet in order to walk on the ground you were never built to walk on the ground you were never constructed to be comfortable in this life you were never put here to like it to fit in you were never placed here just to go with the flow and and be happy here you'll never be happy here because you're not a chicken you're an eagle you're an eagle when you were conceived you were an eagle before you were ever in the barnyard you were an eagle the eagle hatches out and he's a misfit and doesn't understand his life and doesn't know who he is or where he came from or where he's going he just assumes he's like everybody else out there until a certain day amen when mother eagle comes flying over and she lets out a scream and he looks up and he sees a creature and when he sees it he knows who he is when we saw a prophetic ministry step on the seed and do what jesus christ could only do when we saw that we knew who we were there was an awakening and saying whatever that is i am whatever whatever power whatever life is living in that prophet that's what i am down on the inside of me i'm the same thing that is and that prophetic ministry began to scream out and scream out and scream out and all of a sudden you look around and you're so not happy anymore after you've heard the message how could you be happy in the barnyard anymore how how can i get there just flap your wings you're built to fly see the fourth seal is bringing us back into our previous condition bringing us back into our predestinated place now brother brahma said these prophets were called eagles he called himself an eagle he's the great eagle brother brenham said he said we're his eaglets eaglets do they look different than the eagle or do they look the same do they act different or do they act the same are they the same fashion are they in a different fashion because we're going to find out as we go down through here that the secret to the fourth seal is incarnation god incarnate in his people the great eagle living his life through a mini-member eagle body amen this is we're not here to be a continuation of man age oh no friends we're not here to be a continuation of the mayonnaise or continuation of the laodicean church age we're here for something totally different amen we've come to an awakening of our original condition we've come to an awakening of who we really are and we're being built we're being instructed we're being told how to fly brother branham starts talking about the new birth and he says god is perfected in threes like father son holy spirit makes one god and justification sanctification baptism holy ghost makes one birth water blood and spirit makes one birth and he just brought us to the church ages amen through through uh lion ox man and then eagle but brother van is very very sure to let us know that god's not known in four he's known in three the antichrist is known and fourth but god is known in perfection in three not in four so really when we get to the eagle age this isn't a fourth age friends it's a fourth stage of revelation but really what it is it's revealing what the first three were because justification sanctification baptism of holy ghost line ox man is the new birth and the birth is not the fourth stage the three are the birth the water the blood and the spirit when the baby's coming the water the blood and the spirit you don't come to water blood and spirit and then birth the water blood and spirit is the birth is life not a fourth stage but the result of the three is life amen and the result of the three the lion knocks the man is life is god himself amen he come down a son of man revealing the son of man an eagle revealing the eagle to call out eagles amen the uneagle revealing the eagle to call out eagles he says in the in the second seal he said god works his place in a trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself and his people with the baptism of the holy ghost you got that listen again god works his place in a trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people with the baptism of the holy ghost same thing the devil's just in type after christ and satan incarnates himself when jesus incarnates himself in the people the very life that was in christ is in this person amen brother ben says in the in the third seal he said then the spirit antichrist become incarnate in a man he's talking about the devil now moving through he says we find out later on he becomes an incarnate devil too the demon goes away and the devil comes in amen in the fourth seal he says now notice he will be given a heart of a beast at that time and satan would incarnate himself because when the church goes up satan casts down sea and it's done then all of his accusing is done so we know that the the fourth seal brother branham is telling us that when the bride goes up satan himself will come down and he'll fully incarnate the beast at that time fully incarnate the pope and become the beast at that time but there's a mystery in incarnation the seal is all about incarnation and what god is doing by the opening of the seals he's coming in full measure where did the mighty angel go remember the mighty angel came down who agrees with that when the mighty angel come down where did the mighty angel go did he turn around and go back when he came down he stayed down when the mighty angel came down where did he go he went into the church god incarnate in his people that's how we'll overcome this age that's how we'll fly away in a rapture because it's god it's not a life you live it's a life he lives through you the opening of the seals brought the full word the full life the full holy ghost the holy ghost have been bound by the denominational rivers for nearly 2 000 years but to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message back on the people again hallelujah because why the battle moved from heaven to eden and the battle come in us and now we had to have something come in us to overcome the battle because as long as he can get a subject to let down on the word of god he has won the battle over god's word but god's going to come in and ensure himself that they're not going to be defeated that satan's not going to lose because he's going to come incarnate in his people i just want to read this a couple more times so so that you really really believe it not just think it here this this idea of god incarnate of people doesn't do anything in your mind i mean it's an exciting thought we can shout and say hallelujah it's got to move from the mind to the heart it's got to be literally god doing the work inside of me not me first three stages of them that went to the dark ages so it's three stages going into the dark ages the white horse the red horse the black horse then the third the third three stages come the church out so you come into the dark ages through three through the first three church ages then you go to thyatira thyatira goes to the dark ages then you come out through three justification sanctification baptism holy ghost you know luther wesley the restoration of the bride tree so he's saying three go into the dark ages three come out justification sanctification baptism holy ghost again incarnate god made manifest among us brother brahm doesn't just say this once or he doesn't just say this twice this is the scriptures friends it's the incarnate god inside of us and the message show us the follies is don't try to go to some seminary and get some of this undocumented embalming fluid put in you of some social creed the thing you want is the baptism of the holy spirit the incarnate power of god dwelling in you my goodness we don't want we don't want anything else but god coming down we don't want anything else but to come to the eagle anointing friends brother rem says in the fifth seal he says in the bible the last age was an eagle age and god likens the eagle to his prophet see and the last days the eagle age revealer of the true word before god moves to action like he did in the days of noah he sent forth an eagle when he brought israel on pharaoh's army was ready to go he sent an eagle every time he sends an eagle at the last end of it and here he sends an eagle again that's exactly with the word so how can you make it anything else he sends an eagle why a revealer of the truth that's been fallen all through the age so how in the world the ox or the man or whatever beast was writing how could it ever be revealed until the eagles come they had their place they were godly sent beasts just the same as anybody else was the lion that was the original and when the antichrist come up in the combat then he raised up another power he sent a power to meet it then he raised up another power and he sent another power to meet it and then at last he brings down the eagle to do what to restore the children back to the original faith again of the fathers the eagle age have we come to the eagle age are we eagles hallelujah then what are eagles supposed to do whatever eagles do eagles shouldn't be acting like uh chickens eagles shouldn't be acting like buzzards eagles shouldn't be acting like hawks eagles should be acting like eagles and if we eat on the fresh kill of the word we're going to have strength to fly amen praise the lord so we find out that that these twins come down incarnate brother brenham told us now he said the time that jesus come who else came judas there's always twins but what happened to judas when it came time amen for jesus to be crucified and resurrect judas become incarnate by the devil it's incarnation we're moving all the way through the seals in jesus ministry he moves all the way through the seals he comes he's incarnate god but then judas is incarnate by the devil the devil having entered judas we find them moving down through this line but the interesting thing is peter's moving down through this line too remember we talked about peter going through the first three seals peter starts in compromise by denying the word and when jesus said the son of man must be amen must be taken and mistreated and crucified amen he says far be it from that to happen that shall never happen to you we find out he's under the white horse rider and then he takes a sword when they come to get him and cuts off the ear of the high priest he's in the red horse rider then he goes and he denies the lord three times and he's under the black horse he goes out and weeps and repents he's in the black horse and he's following the same path but something's going to change something's going to change because judas takes another step that peter can't take judas can't repent he goes and he tries to return the silver he goes back to the priest and he tries he knows that he's condemned now and he tries to repent but he doesn't go to god he goes to the lord he's just trying to cover his tracks right he's not coming to any true kind of repentance he's just trying to cover up and and they won't take it he throws it down on the floor and he goes out and he hangs himself brother bam said most people see three crosses he said but there was four judas hung himself where did judas go spiritual death peter moved all the way through the horse riders peter's a miserable human being now he's weeping he's rejected the lord amen but god is going to do something in his mercy to peter he's going to bring peter through the sixth seal he shows up in john 21 and he tells peter peter loveth thou me more than these peter's hearts crushed you think peter didn't think every day of his life about denying the lord do you think he wasn't suffering for what he had done wrong you think he wasn't embarrassed every time he saw the lord but here god in his mercy he doesn't let anything go friends he deals with it you and i we have to come to repentance god doesn't sweep things under the rug for you and i god deals with them and here he is with peter and he's dealing with peter's sin he says peter lovest thou me more than these how many times did he ask peter that three times how many times had peter denied the lord three times and after peter moves through the sixth seal and repentance amen then he goes to the upper room and in the upper room he's filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and now a man who had denied the lord a man who had cut off the ear of the high priest a man who had done so many things wrong now he spills out of the upper room and what is he he's incarnate he's an eagle and he begins to stand up and preach the gospel preaches the first message preaches water baptism in jesus name preaches the baptism of the holy ghost starts laying it down so much so that now he begins a man who who was who was vile a man who was disobedient to the lord a man who had rejected what god said a man under the influence of the four horse riders now he comes out and he's walking to the gate called beautiful and now a beggar man begging for alms he fastens his eyes upon him he says look upon us he says gold and silver have i none but such as i have what did he have he had life friends he had god incarnate on the inside he was standing there as an amateur god on the earth again he was there to give back amen what he had such as i have give i unto you in the name of jesus christ take up thy bed and walk he had moved through the horse riders he had moved through all kinds of sin but when he come amen through the sixth seal and come in contact with god now what we have on the earth is an eagle see it doesn't matter what you've come through it doesn't matter what's happened in the past it doesn't matter how many times you failed the lord it doesn't matter how many mistakes you made if you can come to a true repentance if you can face down the things that you've done and you can take them one by one and face them and commit to them and confess them and come to them you can come back to that place where eagles fly paul the apostle oh my goodness do you think that he did not suffer for the crimes that he committed against the christians can you imagine if you're now fellowshipping in church with people where you had consented to the death of their loved ones you come into the church and and you're the one who arrested mom you're the one who had rested my aunt you're the one who was wreaking havoc in all the churches of god and all of a sudden he comes in contact with the pillar of fire and now now with god on the inside now he becomes something totally different than what he was now he's walking through and he does a notable miracle and the people look at him and they realize this isn't just a man and they begin to fall down his feet and worship it and say the gods have come down why because it was a son of god had become incarnate with the holy spirit and that my friends is the eagle age we're called to something more he said we're going to go back amen to whatever pentecost was we're going back to that we're called to something so much more than worrying about what we did in the past and all the mistakes that we've made in the past and every failure that we've had in the past we're here to come now to come in contact with a living god i mean we've come to the eagle age where there's been a scream that says come up higher resurrect out of the old denominationalism resurrect out of the old dead come back to life again and with the life of god inside friends everything is possible we've got we're moving into an eagle life not a chicken life an ego life with evil potentials for ego works to wear whatever god did you can do whatever jesus christ did you can do when the seals are open and redemption claims come back mother branham's standing there we talked about this last time in colorado and he's standing there and he's doing everything that adam could do before the fall was that just for him or is god going to be made manifest in a mini-membered body you can't look in the mirror and see a chicken you can't look in the mirror and see just a man but you've got to be able to look in the mirror and see an eagle you've got to be able to see a son of god with the full potentials of what god is his attributes are we've moved into eagle age it's time to act like it the secret of the fourth seal is incarnation if the devil's he's already incarnate in his church but he's going to be incarnate in one man but god came to be incarnate in his church man let's all stand musicians if you can come praise the lord you know when paul when paul was casting out spirits and opening blind eyes and healing the sick and doing all of that all that he was doing he couldn't be entertaining thoughts about remember when you did this to so and so remember stephen remember when you rejected christ remember when when you didn't go down to the meetings remember when when you stood there and you watched him stone stephen to death remember when you took papers and and you wreaked havoc among the churches he couldn't listen to any of that friends he had a new birth he had a new identification the old man was dead and he was walking in newness of life amen we've got to let the old man die we've got to let the old waves die the old habits die the old concerns die and let the old sins die brother said you're the spotless virtuous sinless let me say that again you're the spotless virtuous sinless because of the atonement you're the spotless virtuous sinless bride of jesus christ if you can come back to your original condition and you can have faith in the atonement amen there is nothing impossible unto you paul had so much confidence in the atonement that he could become an amateur god on the earth and friends this week in the last two weeks we've had fires raging in the west coast we had an 8.2 magnitude earthquake off the coast of mexico we have two hurricanes hitting the united states what is it birth pains what are birth pains the creation groaning what's it groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god the earth right under your feet friends when you look at the news it's calling for you to come to manifestation that hurricane that's ravishing amen the coast of florida right now what's it doing it's calling for you to come to manifestation now the hurricane harvey that that caused the worst flooding in u.s history what was doing it was calling for you to come to manifestation i mean the earthquake what's it calling for it's groaning groaning under birth pains calling for the manifestation of the sons of god what do we have to do die give up the old life die to yourself and lay in the presence of the son god sent his word not to be something that we we label ourselves as message believers oh my goodness it's not for a label it didn't come amen to make a nice church to attend to the message didn't come for all that the message called came to call eagles out of the barn yard to come soar in the heavenlies amen you've been called out of laodicea amen you've been called out of the church ages you've been called into the bride age into the eagle age why for a manifestation of the sons of god and how are we going to get there by the word i just can't stress it enough i wish i could just sit down with you and talk to you and say don't let anything distract you from this word i don't even know how to make it any more serious than i can i don't know how to plead any more than i pled i don't know how i could sit down and beg you but don't go a day without this word don't allow if social media is distracting you from the word of god throw it away if you spend an hour or two on social media and emails and and whatever instagrams and facebooks and stuff and you don't spend an hour in the word throw the social media away because it's not going to take you in a rapture it's not going to bring a manifestation of the son of god but this word is what is it that's keeping us from church what is it that's keeping us from fellowship with the saints what is it that's keeping us from reading from listening from praying whatever it is it's time to throw it away friends it's not worth it anymore we're getting to the day don't you feel him calling you don't you feel the pull of the hour then you not feel the magnet oh my goodness it it's getting stronger and stronger day by day can't you hear him calling you can't you hear the earth groaning under your feet for the manifestation of the sons of god how can we neglect this word anymore how can we let a job or a relationship or a friend or the internet or anything else keep us from what we're called to i'm going to say it again and i'm going to say it again and i'm going to say it again because something has to break the cycle this word has power in it this word has life in it this word has the life to live itself if you'll just receive it if you'll just give your life to it it's got a life in itself this message of the hour has its own life and it's the life of jesus christ and if you'll just just give up your life and take that life it'll produce what you've never been able to produce in the past well i tried that how long did you try a week two weeks it's worth your devotion it's worth your lifetime devotion well i tried and then i failed then just keep going keep trying don't stop don't stop every time the devil lays a stumbling stone in front of you don't stop every time you get a disappointment or discouragement keep with the word friend confess it believe it read it listen to it pray over it don't let anything take it from you if this is the last message that i ever preached here you've got to stick with this word amen it's the only thing that's going to see you through you're not going to make it over your 50 years of merit being in the message 30 years 40 years 50 you're not going to make it based off a merit badge or a credit system you won't make it based off that you're gonna i'm not gonna make it based off who your parents are or where you go to church or who you're related to you're never gonna make it that way you're not gonna make it on your moral character you're not gonna make it on your ability to live right you're going to make it because the word the life of the word has lived his life through you what breaks my heart is i'll say it and i'll scream it and i'll say it and somebody will go off tomorrow and play games and watch a movie and play it breaks my heart it kills me that i'll pour myself out and brother man poured his life out and the message has been poured out and we'll play games with it that we'll have it and not devote ourselves to it that will not we will play we'll play all kinds of sports things and get all kinds of leagues and and do all kinds of goofy stuff but we won't stick with the very thing that was sent to give us rapture and faith i love you guys i love you enough to tell you the truth this is the only thing i ever want you to get is give your whole life to jesus christ give him every fiber of your being he's worthy and jesus christ is the word and the word has been revealed and restored through the message give your life completely to him it is not worth your goofy cell phone it's not worth all the things that you keep up with it's not worth it friends it's not worth your kids activities in school it's not worth sporting activity it's not worth any of those things we live in a world that'll keep you so busy there's no time for god but i'm telling you he's calling he is drawing like he's never drawn before we've come to the time it has come time for a full manifestation of the full life of jesus christ and he's calling for it he can you hear him calling for it how many hears him calling he's calling for a greater life he's calling for a greater manifestation he's calling for a greater devotion how many will say lord kill me again consume this sacrifice let's sing that song consume me lord [Music] let's sing together make it a fresh commitment right now lord consume me if i lay myself down as a sacrifice on the altar again will you burn it up afresh will you burn it up and will you will you come and give me more of your life friends that's what we need not a greater effort not not a greater human commitment what we need is more of him a greater surrender to receive a greater life let's sing this together [Music] me lord and make me more like me [Music] break [Music] [Applause] of my life let me be [Music] consume me lord and make me more like thee and break me lord and bless the broken pieces of my life let me be god bless your friends make sure to remember to keep our our friends and brothers and sisters in prayer that are in the path of the storm we know that god's going to undertake for them because he knows i just want to say i love you i don't mean to be mean i hate preaching like that but i know it's right it's not me it's something pushing through me i feel like you see people you see individuals you love you'd love them so dearly and you just want to say wake up the devil's cataracts on your eyes you're missing what's going on right now the the whole earth is shaking amen everything's falling apart there's absolute chaos on every sector and god's bringing us higher there's such a joy such a satisfaction in the holy ghost such a life oh my goodness and you see ones that the devil is distracting and pulling them off to the side oh my heart bleeds it just aches inside now's not the time to play now's not the time to have your own opinion now is not the time to lay out a church because i don't like what's hurt or i'm disappointed and discouraged i'm gonna just sit back and nurse my wounds and talk about my hurt it's not time for that friends it's not time just to get disgruntled and dissatisfied it's not time for that it's time to die just completely die say god i want to live oh don't you hear it can't you feel it don't you know it's time oh i wish i could say it a nicer way i wish i could be more eloquent with it i wish there was some other way but i don't know any other way than just to cry out but we're at the hour that we've longed for we've come to the time and so many of you dedicated your lives and given up everything and is still giving up everything and i love you for it we've committed ourselves completely and holy to one thing and that's to jesus christ but old friends if there's something that's still dividing your affection and pulling you this way or that way it's time i invite you today to say i'm finished with it say i'm done i'm done being distracted i'm done being tantalized by the world i'm done entertaining my flesh i'm finished i'm finished with movies i'm finished with with tv i'm finished with social media i'm finished i'm just finished with video games i'm finished with these things i'm finished something's pulling me higher [Music] you know old johnny crow remember the story of old johnny crow those old johnny crow got tied down by a farmer and he would leap and try to fly and leap and try to fly and he couldn't get there because his leg was tied down to the ground somebody felt sorry for him and come along and they they sniped the rope so that he could fly but he got so used to being tied to the ground he didn't realize that he was free and could could fly anytime he wanted and friends god has come and clipped your string and you can fly any time you want [Music] don't get so used to being earthbound to forget the fact that you're an eagle and you were called to fly you can perform the supernatural now amen you can perform in the supernatural realms now you can climb higher in the heights of god now you can have a prayer life now you can have revelation on the word right now your string has been clipped johnny and by the way you're not a crow you're an eagle some of us have stumbled around in the chicken yard so long we don't realize that we're free that we fly we've been called to fly mother eagle's still screaming come up here and soar in the heavenlies oh how i love you how i i wish i could take it and just shove it right in i would do it for every one of you but i believe god's calling and i believe there's a people here that's responding saying i'm gonna fly just get out of your comfort zone get out of the familiar lay it aside stretch those spiritual wings and start flying in the heavenlies you know they found that eagles spend so much time flying and it's not hunting for food they did a research and found out they spent so many hours in the air only a certain percentage that was food and the researchers can only come up with one conclusion the only conclusion they could come up with for the why they spent so much time in the air is the fact that eagles enjoy flying [Music] we just enjoy flying who enjoys flying oh praise god let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you lord for your word god you've brought us through an eagle anointing to an eagle age and you've called us out of the chicken yard lord sometimes we just flapped enough to get up on the post or in a nearby tree but you didn't call us just to come that far lord you came us to call us to a full eagle life to a full ego manifestation and i'm laying down my life right now lord would you consume me god consume this sacrifice lord and give me give me ego life through and through lord take control of me lord as i yield myself to you and these that are in here lord there's those that are deciding right now to lay something down i pray lord that you would come with the power of your holy spirit and burn it out lord god as they give it to you i pray that you take it away lord habits and all kinds of vices lord and ways of thinking lord let us lay it down and come to that full manifestation of ego life you gave us wings to fly with not just a flap around and get up to a post or get up to a tree but you've called us to the heavenly lord and we're going to fly we're going to fly for our food but we're going to fly just for the pure joy of flying lord to be in your realms to be near to you lord we enjoy it so much call us lord up higher i pray god that your anointing would fall upon us that you would give us the power to overcome this age that you would bring us out with a mighty hand and that you would be victorious in us and that you would overcome every obstacle within us we love you god we ask for your blessings as we part and go our ways continue to be with our brothers and sisters lord down in florida lord move on them in a mighty way let the eagles rise in faith and lay claim to their promises lord let them rest knowing that you all as well because you're watching over them lord i pray as we leave these doors that this message wouldn't fade from our ears but we would walk out of here bold as an eagle walks lord for an eagle doesn't walk like a chicken an eagle walks bold ready to take to the air at any moment let us soar lord to new heights let us fly in the heavenlies like never before we give you our life and ask that you would have preeminence in us and lead us in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god bless you saints we can sing as you're dismissed we love you with the love of the lord pray for you every day how many will pray for me i pray for you god's calling and we're responding do you feel it [Music] just respond to it i'll tell you a testimony i know it's late but i just love you the spirit is sweet the atmosphere is right just a personal testimony of all my life wanted a prayer life all my christian life come to the message and i would pray i pray every day you know because a christian prays every day sometimes just getting out your bible and reading and getting on your knees to pray is nothing more than showing your respect and reverence to god it's something we ought to do but one thing i learned in all that is you cannot manufacture a prayer life i've tried i would pray and i would set aside time and i would pray and you know 15 minutes into prayer i'm just repeating the cycle again and i'm struggling to pray and falling asleep and i won't ask you to raise your hands if you've been there because you all been there [Music] and wanting to have a prayer life but not able to produce a prayer life but still praying every day because that's my respect to god that's my honor to him is to bow before him every day but something happened about a year ago for me all of a sudden all i can do is describe is he started pulling me into prayer wasn't anything that was manufactured it wasn't anything that was made up it's just a tug in my heart to pray and it was almost like he was wooing me into communion with him you know sometimes you would just like your spouse just to come and sit with you for a while just just you try to get him just to come and sit down and just talk with you for a while that's what it felt like he just he just wanted me he just wanted me to come and talk to him and i felt that pull and all i did you know for a few days i just felt the pull i didn't do anything about it why are we so thick-headed i don't ever know why god deals with human beings i don't know but we're thick school week went by and i keep thinking yeah i'm going to pray i i feel him pulling me but finally there was a day that i set my alarm an hour early [Music] and i got up and i entered into prayer and i had the sweetest time of prayer that i've ever had and for a year now lord's been getting me up early i've been praying one hour two hour every day and i don't say that for any other reason and tell you he called for it all i did was respond has he been calling you into prayer have have you been busy putting it off for another time or maybe after i get this done or tomorrow telling your friends all you've got to do is step into it and it happens it's him that's calling is he calling you into a closer walk is he calling you to higher heights can you feel him calling you all you've got to do is step into it just lay down it's not anything you can manufacture you can't manufacture a closer walk you can't manufacture an overcoming life you can't manufacture a prayer life you can't manufacture a faith walk it's not something you do it's something he calls you to but you've got to be willing to lay something down and step into it [Music] it's been the most wonderful experience of my life when i say god i want more i'm not satisfied i want more he's calling for more do you feel him calling you has he been calling to you for more has he been asking you to come and sit with him and talk with him i'd encourage you step into it he'll make it happen you won't have to manufacture a thing there's nothing that's made up in the christian life i don't think when paul and silas were singing and praising the lord when they were in prison chains i don't think that was manufactured praise i think it was genuine and everything in the kingdom of god is genuine friends but he's calling for it and i want to step into it how many wants to step into it just lay it down and just move forward he'll do it you don't have to do a thing praise god you can be dismissed as we sing i hope you forgive me for holding you but i do love you i love you with all my heart and i know that soon we're going to be sitting around the marriage supper of the lamb and everything every struggle every sermon [Music] every every bit of self-sacrifice is going to be so worth it there every bit of scourging that we had to endure and every correction we come to we're going to be so thankful when we're sitting there friends and i'm going to be sitting there with you and i'm going to be happy we're going to look across the table each other and we're just going to give that knowing smile we won't even say anything we're just going to look at each other we're going to smile and we're going to say this is it this is what we spent so much time talking about dreaming about and working for it's here i'm gonna see you there friends it's a wonderful time we're coming to it we're on the threshold of it and he wants it worse than you do he's drawing you as much as you want him he wants you more all you've got to do is step into it friends surrender give something up make some time you'll never regret him let's sing this song [Music] me lord [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and bless the broken pieces of my heart let me be [Music]
