to be home very much happy to be home I hope you're happy to see us oh good okay it's mutual Mutual feeling we like that we can have bases for Fellowship so good to see you all this evening uh let you have your seats for a moment that's okay so here's my disclaimers I'm tired I'm very tired I just chugged an espresso trying to wake myself up I think we both fell asleep today brother Chad and I it was a long trip I want to have a deeper voice that sounds good again yeah I always like that and so if I slur my words if I say the wrong words you know we're well taught take me for what I mean not for what I say so you have to tune in and maybe catch the thought so God bless you really do appreciate all the prayers all the text messages when you're on the other side of the world and you're tired and then I get a head cold and you're weak and you just feel very very very little you think what in the world how can I ever be a blessing in this kind of weekend State and then you get a little text message a little encouragement you think well God has a principle and our weakness his strengths made strong so and we just had a confidence that God was using us to be a blessing but I'll be honest with you we came back with a blessing I don't I don't think you you can give a blessing without receiving a blessing in return and I came back very very blessed very encouraged in the fellowship and and the time spent with everyone so it was really really special so just feel like saying hi I don't know why it's like hello good to see everyone so I hope it's okay I was uh uh so we got home last night I think at three o'clock I spent an hour and a half fellowshipping with my family laid down on the couch passed out for four hours first got up ate something passed out again got up came in met with Brother Franco put together some pictures went home passed out so it's been a catching up on sleep but I only average like three hours of sleep the whole trip time we were there with the jet lag and everything and I don't sleep good in life anyhow and so so I've been catching up so this probably means I won't sleep for a week going forward but so it was really really good so if it's okay I'd like to um just kind of give you a background here this was a wonderful trip for the sake of being able to spend time in Fellowship not only with the Brethren but with brother Chad first trip obviously officially going overseas together and doing something in the form of ministry together and it was wonderful it was just good from time we left to the time we got back it was really really enjoyable really fun we had a good time we talked we laughed we were exhausted together we encouraged one another we poked and prodded each other to keep going so it was it was good to be there and you all know how this all happened originally we were supposed to go together and we didn't God had a different plan in mind and at the time it scared me to death and but we made it through and and then here we are eight years later I hadn't been overseas since 2019 first trip overseas I get a chance to go and I go back to where it all began in the Philippines so had a the first time I ever ministered was in the Philippines first time I ever baptized anybody was in the Philippines and I got a new one I dedicated a baby they had me dedicate a baby while I was there so that was that was fun that was really interesting like what I don't know what I'm doing so Philippine is a first for many things so so it's got a special place in my heart just the whole thing and how God confirmed so many things over the years and as you begin this journey I don't think any of us have a confidence in ourselves like as we get going like hey we get this figured out we know how this is going to work and the more I more I've lived walked with the Lord served him I find out I'm just along for the ride this is just something he's been doing I'm just here I I'm not doing anything I'm not trying to make anything happen God's just in control orchestrating and all I can do is just yield that's the the biggest thing I can do is just get out of the way and submit you know I'm My Own Worst Enemy in life and and I'm just learning to submit I'm learning to keep my hand up a little higher in my head down a little lower as we walk through this journey we just it builds our confidence in God that he's with us and he's leading us and guiding us so it was really a special time and I really appreciated every moment of it so if it's okay I want to start in on the PowerPoint presentation but before then I I kind of had a little thought before and this is a very broken up thing I hope this is okay but just a little thing that impressed me as an overall theme of the trip and then a little thought from at the end and and I I realized just how much I appreciate Fellowship I I really really enjoyed the fellowship with the Brethren from different churches different pastors and ministers meeting 100 I don't know 100 different ministers there in Fellowship around the world and and honor and a respect each one not that they'd agree in every aspect of their understanding of of the message but they had enough love and respect one for the other one that there was a it was it created a wonderful time of fellowship with everyone and I was so blessed and encouraged by that and then you get so many times I mean we we really either in a service or eating with the brethren for like a weak solid and so we broke a lot of bread to no we broke a lot of rice together is what we did they don't eat much bread it's a lot of of rice and so I'm looking forward to not eating rice for a month and so uh but you know just spending that time in Fellowship I mean you look back in the ministry of Jesus Christ and how much time he was there fellowshipping and he loved that Fellowship sitting around a fire eating and just bring you know breaking some bread together and it just kind of brought the whole thing back together with me again you know so much time we we spend um we're so focused on certain things you know and trying to be this or get this right or do this but what you find is you have a common Bond and it was the love of Jesus Christ and the grace of God to you not anything we did it was the grace of God to us each and every one of us and so we can find a common Bond of Fellowship it's not what I did it's what he did and so you find that as as the more you talk you hear their testimony then they ask you about your testimony or how God used them here and how God used you here and and you begin to find out we just serve a great God we just serve a wonderful savior a risen savior a living God in our midst guiding and leading us through it and so that Fellowship just meant so much to me and you know in Psalms it says behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity and so there's something refreshing about it you know it's like an anointing that comes with it just feels you it makes you feel so good when you have that good Godly Fellowship you you know you experience it here with someone you know not maybe a trivial conversation but when it's a good Godly Fellowship you're encouraging them they're encouraging you you're you're you're giving a little and they're taking a little and it's a give and take you know and brother Branham said like brother Bosworth ask them the question you know what Fellowship is he said what is it he says there's two fellas One ship and there's a give and a take and there's a camaraderie and an understanding as time goes on and uh and there's not a one of us that I I find as a Christian there's not one of us that doesn't go through persecutions sufferings disappointments discouragements we have something in common and it's through all of that we begin to love the Lord more we become more confident in his grace before more confident it's leadership and it creates this Bond of Fellowship this basis of fellowship and it just meant the world to me and I had a little quote that I came across in Fellowship it's a sermon brother Brandon preach called Fellowship he said now when God made man in the beginning to he made man in the beginning to fellowship with him this then this man was in perfect Fellowship in the Garden of Eden he was in perfect fellowship with God and how it must have been in that day when God would come down in the cool of the evening and call out Adam he and Eve would come up and they would worship God and they would have fellowship and communion one with the other and that's the very thing that calls us together like this sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit no differences among us we're all one in Christ Jesus A Perfect Harmony of Fellowship there's nothing like it that I have found in all the Earth is to come together in Heavenly places and have communion and fellowship with God and with each other now that's what God intended in the Garden of Eden then that Fellowship from God and man was broken by sin and God made man on the basis and the ground upon which man could remain or retain his fellowship and it wasn't through a get-together or an organization or through an education it was through the basis of the shed blood and that's the only place of Fellowship that we have with God today that's the only meeting place is through the blood of Jesus Christ that's exactly right and see that's where we have our basis of Fellowship that's where we can have things in common though we may not see everything exactly right we have one thing in common that's the grace of God and so he also says and men don't you just can't educate themselves you can't educate your way to uh to one another we got too many complexes you don't get you you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love that's where you get love not complexes you don't get to a point you say I'm a little bigger than the other one I'm a little better than this one or I'm a little better than that one you just get your arms around everybody and it's the basis of Love through the blood of Jesus Christ just makes it to relive everybody even in their differences we're all a little bit odd to One Another We're supposed to be we complement each other and it creates a fellowship because we have things in common so I like that that's my thought on Fellowship sorry I enjoyed it I loved it brother Franco won't we start in on the PowerPoint presentation so everybody loving one another okay here we go so here's the trip and we started here on Thursday I think it's 6 a.m but the Chad picked me up and we traveled up to Detroit from Detroit we took our first flight over to Seoul South Korea and it was 15 and a half hours which they extended it for 30 or 45 minutes to take us out and around Russia for some reason they didn't want us flying over Russia so then uh maybe that was a good thing who knows and so then we here's the Philippines from Seoul South Korea we took another flight four and a half hours down to Manila and when we got to Manila oh some little facts but the Franco put this together it's awesome I could never have done this 109 million people and I think they all came out to drive every time we went to go somewhere I'm pretty sure I told them all I says you all are far closer to perfection than I am because it's Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience you have way more patience in me Manila traffic is horrendous I miss everybody there but I don't miss the traffic at all it's an amazing amount of traffic a four-hour trip becomes a seven hour trip a one-hour trip it comes a two-hour trip so it was fun and some strange way so we started off with the blessing you know when you go for 15 and a half or 16 hours and there's nobody between you it's awesome it's an amazing feeling that one time that first time I went over there I was on a six hour flight and I was the guy in the middle between some very healthy individuals healthy men very well healthy very so they were so healthy that it forced me to go stand by the bathroom for four hours to uh to have some space to my own and so that right there was a huge blessing just to have some space there here was our welcoming party uh it was really nice they they said we're here waiting for you and so you got brother Vernon brother Nestor brother June brother Sammy Brother Don Don and I'm forgetting the other ones brother the other brothers but just a really nice welcoming party they were excited to see us and um we got to brother Nestor so we got in around midnight one o'clock um I I and so we got to bed and I think there was 60 70 people staying in the home so it was a packed house Brother semester's house became a common place for everyone to go so thankfully brother Chad and I got a room to ourselves because some of the rooms had like 10 12 people in it and so it was it was packed out so it was wonderful brother Nestor wants to thank everyone here for the home it's a beautiful home and it's a real blessing to not only his family it's a blessing to everybody he just opens his house up pretty much to anybody that needs a place to stay at all times so he really wanted me to personally tell everyone thank you for the help in building his home so we had our first breakfast first little time of fellowship with everyone and it was just so nice you know you go somewhere and you'd have time I met these two brothers and there's brother landlan in the blue his other two brothers are from one of the islands had a wonderful time of Fellowship just talking to him you know and they're both pastors of an assembly and it was just really special stood there I think for an hour hour and a half and got to build a relationship with both of them it was fun to meet the old friends and it was fun to make some new friends while we were there and made some lifelong friends again I know and then here's uh brother nestor's amazing table it's a tree it's like six inches I think it it took 12 people to carry it in so it's a it was it was a great table uh for us to be able to have some fellowship uh for breakfast around and see everybody's happy and but then Esther and sister Hannah there in the corner they took great care of us they fed us amazingly well too well we ate too much food wasn't used to that much food and um and then brother Nestor loves us so he took us to a coffee shop to get some good espressos we were craving good expressos and so he took good care of us in that regards and got a chance to to do that now the main purpose of what we went there for was brother nesters it was brother nestor's 35th year Church anniversary and that was the main objective I believe it was and then there was some added things to the objective so I think yeah a lot of services on brother Chad I was proud of him man I was like that's awesome brother Ted I'm glad they're putting more on you than me I'm really happy about that he's the man of the hour I'm like yes give it to him he's the man I'm sit here sick wanting to sleep for three days so but I was really proud of him he did good he just submitted the gift and God used the gift and um so yeah there's brother Nasser 35th year anniversary so the first day they actually um Saturday was a rest day Sunday they split us up I ministered in the morning at brother nesters brother Chad went over to brother um Vernon's yes but the Vernon's church and preached the morning service and then they all came back and brother Chad preached the uh the anniversary evening service a wonderful service light in the darkness uh people were really really blessed by it here's the the church so this is by the nestor's new church I don't know if there was pictures seen of it but it's a beautiful assembly beautiful church building there just uh and and the assembly there and those are packed it was packed out house so here's another picture of the the Saints there so and so it was a wonderful time of fellowship and uh here's brother Nester and everybody these are all the ministers that gathered up I don't know if they're over 30 ministers that were present and then oh and so I I have probably a thousand pictures I don't think we've smiled that much since I I don't think I've ever smiled that much in my life and in that short of time frame so um Filipinos love pictures they love pictures so every couple minutes we we were prepped and ready for a selfie so it was good but we've got our don't ask us for a picture right now okay just being honest with you there's not going to be any pictures from Brother Chad and I for quite some time right now so so um but yeah we're pictured out so it was fun though we had a good time with it these are the brothers there's brother Nester in the middle so it was a good time then afterwards we had a fellowship dinner so it was a beautiful Fellowship dinner they did a they did a wonderful job and everybody had a great time and and this one's for the kids I know they like that this will be the subject matter that they'll be talking about for the next couple days I threw that in for them they killed the fatted pig for us and it was delicious it was wonderful and don't feel bad everything that you have to live by dead substance something has to die for you to live and this piggy he upgraded himself in life he was feeding the Bride of Jesus Christ so he wasn't just a pig wandering around in the woods he was actually becoming a part of the Fulfillment of God's Ministry on her so it was a good thing um here's a little time of Fellowship around the table and that was wonderful so then that was Sunday and then Monday we had a ministers meeting and it was a wonderful time probably one of the highlights of the entire trip for me was being able to gather with the ministers and and just shared a little little thought and by the Chad share the thought and it was wonderful and uh it was really good and I think they were talking about the mercy seat or is Mercy over and explaining and obviously the where the bright age comes in in this lady to see an age and where we are in time and it was really good and then and then brother Nestor he's just so good at teaching and you know he got up and so I videotaped him for just a moment I hope it's okay just a real short little snippet of brother Nestor in action and do I okay just push it out outside see they closed the door but the uh the Lord is still continuing okay after well after day two so what's really nice about it is um one brother will present they'll all ask a question they'll ask a brother to present on it and then respectfully no one tries to convince somebody of another opinion they just offer their their understanding of it and so you can imagine it doesn't it's very respectful it's really sweet and it's kind and everybody has a mutual respect but they're honestly asking questions well brother have you considered this or did you look at it from this perspective or what about this and so and brother Branham said you ministers get together and you talk about these deep things together and that's what he said to do and and I just so appreciated seeing them in action you know it's it's it's um sometimes we can close the circle around us a little too much and brother bam said don't ever become clannish say don't do that he said draw your sick Circle bigger draw them all in bring them in and but it takes maturity to do that and uh and I appreciated seeing that on display watching them you know kindly go back and forth with their ideas and opinions on everything it was really really special to be able to see it in action and Lord willing maybe we can do something like that here if God should so desire so um it was good so then this is the impromptu service when you're when you're nobody argues with feather Nestor it's King Nester we say king king Nester has decreed that you will preach and if you object he smiles laughs and walks away it does not matter what your opinion is so he told Brother Chad with the surprise you've got Tuesday night service so he submitted um there's nothing else you can do so it was a wonderful service it's really nice and it was good to be there so then that was that was Tuesday and then Wednesday we began our travels this is a travel out to the province it's kind of pretty there um countrysides kind of pretty and so that was beautiful views as we were traveling out because we were on our way to Brother Don Don's church for his anniversary meetings and um they put us up in a nice little hotel very very pretty and then they put together this and I told him I said brother if you're going to get a picture of me can you get one that doesn't look like I'm shocked to be here you know it looks like what you what you want me to preach no I like rather you know so everybody else is handsome distinguished I'm like no I'm like shocked what so it was fun this is Brother Don Don wonderful brother we all know brother don don here it's just a just a special brother I really love the brother from the very first time I met him in 2015 and he was kind of explained to him you know he's God he knows that God's kind of calling to the mountains and he's got that ruggedness and I couldn't do what he does he's tough tough as Nails you know they'll travel and walk and Hike all day long to get to a remote Village and then preach there's no time for Preparation and then they'll go from that one and hike to another one and preach again and they're just rugged individuals we're not missionaries we just travel and you know drink coffee and speak you know these are missionaries these guys are rugged rugged individuals so they make you feel like sissies I told Brother Jazz like I'm a soft American I'm just being honest with you I can't do it but wonderful brother brother Don Don and you helped or brother Donovan helped him out I think with the tent and stuff and so he he appreciated all the help so that was the I I took service that night brother Chad went over to brother in so here's brother earnings church I believe this is Brother earnings and they were singing a special brother Chad brother Danny interpreted for him at brother earnings and so they had a good time of Fellowship there and then so we both traveled back then Thursday was morning service by the Vernon here's brother Vernon I think he's been here before you all know him and a wonderful brother he spoke on the seasons of our life and I I got a lot of good notes I'd like to do something around that for the Youth I got some ideas on it brother Chad got some good stuff from that and just talking about the seasons of our life there in the morning service and that was wonderful and here's Brother Don Don's church it's beautiful another they they work hard to make a nice atmosphere a nice Sanctuary for the for the Believers and so brother Chad had that evening service and brother June uh translated for him and so then it like I said if we're not preaching or in service we're eating and so we had another fellowship and uh we had another fatted pig that sacrificed for our our our Pro our gain we appreciate him and his sacrifice and so that was good and uh so uh the next morning we had breakfast where we went to a baptism and so five people wanted to get baptized um it was really special this young this I believe this was a minister that he was from like an island or something and he was so impressed by The Fellowship of the brethren in his denomination he was never allowed to even like shake the hands or embrace the ministry there was there was there were two two separated you know too high you couldn't approach to a minister but we're just brothers I mean there's no big ones Among Us no little ones Among Us it's just the grace of God in each of our lives and and he was so impressed by that like he'd come and shake your hand with the biggest smile on your face like wow you're shaking my hand you know he was just impressed by that and sometimes it's just those little things of being loving and caring you know and it had effect on him and so him and his wife wanted to get baptized and so that's that's his wife and then I believe there was three young young people I didn't get a picture of every young person but there was three other young people that were they got baptized and brother Chad and brother don don did the baptism there so so another picture again one of a thousand so I just have to pick the ones I can so from that then we took off and went to a campground so brother uh Danny has purchased some ground out in the countryside so that they could all the churches could have their own place of fellowship and have their own Campground for meetings and special meetings and and things of that nature so brother Danny and brother Nester were kind of taking us through and showing us what they're building what they're working on and it's quite going to be quite a facility when it's done it's quite beautiful but a lot of work to do over the next year or so and so they just kind of took us through everything showed us all the progress and the work and it was really neat to see they've got little little cabins you see the real neat little cabins for the ministers to come and stay in so and then this is their Fellowship Hall so it's quite an undertaking and quite a quite a vision that our brother has and he's working on and and it's really becoming a beautiful thing they can put on if you can tell what that is it's a little bit tricky but that's where they have their meetings under that tent and so it's like an open air area and I think they sat a thousand people there the last meeting joint Fellowship that they had and so that was really nice and then again Fellowship around food so that was really good as well from then we went to Brother vowels I don't know if you've heard of brother Val over the years brother Chad went there many many years ago here's brother Val he's right sweet sweet brother really funny brother really like him and uh he's standing there between brother Chad and I this was his church sweet little church and so that was wonderful and then we proceeded to go back for a four-hour drive back to the town which took us seven hours I think seven and a half hours with all the traffic back into town they split us up at this point I went with brother June and brother Chad went back with brother Nestor and so I wanted to give you a taste of of traffic so there's some things about the Philippines like traffic rules and lines they're all suggestions they don't really mean anything there it's just a suggestion use it if you want to don't use it if you don't want to so what's really interesting is these these this traffic that's going this way well this is on the wrong side of the road um you know there's two lanes on the right side you're supposed to go on that side but if the traffic gets too much they just go down whatever opening they have and so this is the wrong Lanes so I thought if it's okay we'll just show you a little portion so you can appreciate American traffic and so yeah that's a sidewalker that's not even that that there isn't even the road so again whatever space you can find and if your car fits you go for it and uh yeah so it's very pleasurable it's very wonderful I enjoyed every hour and maybe every 20 hours that we spent in the car it was great it was awesome so so glad it's over and when we're away from that at this point so it was good again my perfecting I needed more patience and I found out when I went to the Philippines so it was good and then the next uh the next night this is Brother June so brother June took care of me put me up in a hotel wonderful brother good friend at this point and and like anything they love the Philippines and they see a I guess a tall white person from America and they want to play basketball so we played basketball again you always think it's going to be a friendly match against Brothers with brotherly love and kindness until you play basketball and then you find out this is fierce this is to win you better protect yourself you're going to get hurt and uh so it was fun it was a good fun competitive game we had a great time and uh and it was just fun we sweated a lot and then we had a great time of Fellowship a lot of young Brothers young ministers coming up in his church and just sitting around the table talking to them about life and different things and it was just it was really neat it was really encouraging and so then that next uh next morning I had service there with brother June this is by the June at his church and then brother Chad went to Brother phenols by the finale yeah I believe um and so this is brother fenol and his church and this is um Sunday morning yep and then this is a little picture of it they put all the musical instruments up there on the stage it was really unique so I thought that was really neat so then after that then we proceeded to go to Sunday Services there was always two services and now we're all traveling to get to brother Danny Del Mundo's church for his church anniversary for Sunday evening so um brother Chad I think they wanted to wait brother Chad's like I don't want to wait let's hit the road let's get there because they kind of take traffic a little more relaxed than we do and um so he got there on time we did not I was supposed to speak first and brother Chad was supposed to take the main service I was just going to give an exhortation thanks and then so our two-hour trip to the church became a four-hour trip to the church so we got there late and they changed the order of the service to have brother Chad go first and it was a wonderful service and this is the church this is the the sanctuary there it made a lot of improvements and a really nice nice fellowship with them all here's brother Nestor and uh then our brother Chad preaching and and it was a really really good service this was the baby dedication my first cute little fella man I'm already homesick at this point you make me hold this little fella it's like very very homesick at this point and he's cute and now I want a little boy right Carrie let's go for it we can amen amen so we have more than two or three witness Heroes here at green with us Carrie so um that was really nice this is Brother Boyette a friend I made the very first time he's also a minister there by the Danny's wonderful brother really sweet sweet Spirit about him and it was an honor and a privilege to be able to dedicate his baby to the Lord and um and it was unique and I'll share this at the end though but um so obviously I didn't think I was going to speak which I was really excited about I didn't want to speak I was happy to just sit back and and hang out and then at the end brother Danny asked me to get up and and share whatever was on my heart and what was so interesting about that was as as we were stuck in traffic before the service had began I had just had a little sentence strike my mind and I wrote the sentence down and then I went and I grabbed a couple thoughts about it and and it was almost I turned to brother June after brother Chad started preaching I said look at these and I showed him the quotes and I showed him the sentence and it if it wasn't almost literally the exact thought um and and it was a unique thing to see and and so even as brother Chad was preaching on the wave Chief and this great resurrection and I'm thinking about those notes I'm like wow well that was interesting we both caught the same thought but I was so glad I didn't have to say anything because brother Chad just had so clearly wrapped it up it was so good and then brother Danny's like know maybe the Lord was hindering Brother Kyle to get here brother Kyle wants you come up and share your thought and and so then I I shared the thought and it and it really shocked me and I think it shocked everybody else as just a confirmation of the of God confirming the word that was spoke and just so clearly stating that was the truth you know what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection that this is and God is doing something and I had wrote down the bride is his victory not ours and uh and and then to see that we were even using the same quotes like a portion of the quote that brother Chad read was the top and then the portion of the quote that I had was actually the underneath of that quote about the wave Chief and it was like and he stopped there and then by the grace of God I just read the next portion that was in the quote and so you just come to find out God's in control of this it's not what we do you know time goes on you just get less and less confident in yourself you get more and more confident God's in control it just brings a rest and a security um as as life goes on no matter what you're doing whether it's ministering living where working having Fellowship that God's in the midst of his people and you just go to it just creates such a rest I mean the sum of a Christian Life rest just relax little bride calm down you're his victory it's not what you're doing it's what he's been doing all the while through you and so I just so appreciated that and and I'll share a little bit at that here at the end of this but it was wonderful to see and uh here's the brothers you got Brother Ray there in the middle there we got a chance to see him as well and all the ministering brothers that came from all around to support um brother Danny and to show their appreciation for the ministry and the church and so lots of pictures but the Paulo there a young Minister for the Danny son he's starting to preach doing a wonderful job and and then here's their family all together so then that night then we traveled back into the city so we could get a hotel near the airport and then the next day we just had some fellowship together again and I see the fish another fish that happily gave up its life to feed the body of Christ so they deep fry the whole fish it was really neat and this is Brother Sammy Durano um I'm a missionary in Mindanao is that right by the Chad minda now and been faithful for many many years I think brother chadwin the first time you went there was like five churches there or seven there was three churches now there's 34 churches I think all three of his sons are now pastors and ministers and they've just been laboring and they're very humble he's very quiet they're all just so sweet and kind but you see God just blessing their ministry as they continually looking for the last predestinated seed they're not stopping they're continually going doing what they can to serve God and and to find that last one and also for themselves to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen and so oh but going back to that so we're going to try to help them with some printing work so we're brother Chad was asking him on some titles and some different things so that they can get physical copies of of printed messages to to distribute to the churches up there so we'll be working on that to help support that here soon here's brother ernin um sweet brother and then this is brother James Toronto for the Chads he called him the little bodyguard he's brother Chad's little bodyguard he's about here on brother Chad but he's a Powerhouse I think he said he's a strong little fella so watch out and so we were able to help him get this uh new Workhorse really nice little motorcycle they needed a motorcycle they go up into the mountains brother James goes way up into those mountains they'll travel six seven hours by motorbike into the middle of nowhere to preach to a group of people so we were out we were able to help the brother get this really nice looking dirt bike so looks fun I think he's gonna have a great time we don't yet know how he's going to get on it um so it's a great mystery I'm sure he'll figure something out might put a little strap a little three foot step ladder on the back or something like that but some way or another our brother will will make that work we know he he'll make it work one way or the other so it's it's exciting he's going to have a lot of fun on that so so yeah and then so this is the last picture um of all the brothers mostly all those Brothers in the bank are the brothers from the islands it was a really big deal for them to be able to travel islands are very um poor areas not a lot of funds to be able to do this so it was a privilege for them it was a privilege for us to spend time with them again they encouraged us just as much as we could possibly encourage them I think they encouraged us more to see their faithfulness to see their Fellowship these are all pastors these are all ministers to see their love mutual love one for the other it just and this is how all men will know you're my disciples right you'll have love one for the other and so we're to see it in action is a wonderful thing you know you can speak about the gospel but why don't you live it I like to see living Epistles I believe that's the hour in which we're living God condescending from the thought to the word from the word to the life so it's manifesting time of the things that we've heard and it was good it was wonderful and I really appreciated that time of Fellowship that's it no more pictures none whatsoever so if you don't mind we'll just change here for a moment just share a quick little thought to you uh is that okay you stand for just a moment I I really didn't think I'd go more than half an hour I was kind of hoping to wrap it up but I guess I'm still standing here and they're still awake and so we'll we'll just see what happens here next I really don't know so why don't you turn in your Bibles to first John five verse four first John five verse 4. it says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith just have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've just come right now to look at your word Lord heavens and earth will pass away but your word will never fail Lord just take these little thought that's in my mind these words that you've spoken Lord and speak to our hearts encourage us Lord and help us Lord you know I don't have much in the form of notes but take what's In My Heart Lord use my lips to say what you once said we love you and thank you Jesus name amen maybe seated so really it's funny I have like three scriptures and four quotes that's all I got I don't have much here so just from this scripture this is the scripture that I had wrote down um as I was writing along to just give a word of exhortation and this is um the thought that brother Chad had been ministering on that I came up and just said a couple words and and we know that faith is a victory that overcometh the world it's not my human ability it's not my intellect it's that God placed something down on the inside of my my soul and it's a it's a faith it's a confidence that God keeps his word and my biggest battle is to overcome the ten spies the the five lying Spies of this flesh and the five lines lion Spies of the spirit realm remember there was ten spies that gave an evil report see taste fuel smell here imagination conscience reasoning infections and so I find out but there was still a Caleb in there and Caleb when Josh were standing there saying but we're more than able to overcome the obstacles to overcome the enemy to overcome all that's in front of us because we have a promise that's before us and we're going to the promise and oftentimes you just you don't you're weak in your body you're weak in your spirit realm you're beat up you're worn out you're tired and at the end of the day but there's something down on the inside a little faith a little Caleb saying but God's still more than able to overcome through using me to overcome this situation I'm just as strong today as I was back then and so it just as time goes on I've looked back through my life even just considering all of this and and I'll share this little portion I had had a dream when I was 17 and I had a dream that I was going to be traveling overseas with a minister and I knew it was my pastor and I knew I'd be preaching and I'd held that as a dream in my heart I never shared it with anybody but I was 17 years old and at the time I thought I was going to travel with my pastor at that time who was a Pentecostal pastor but that whole me preaching thing I couldn't understand that and then I've I've watched that over the years and I never shared it with anybody the very thought of me ever ministering scared me I wasn't smart enough I wasn't good at school I couldn't do anything like that but I always had that little dream that I always looked at and then you know coming up to 2015 when I was supposed to go with brother Chad overseas and I and I had that dream in the back of my mind and I was like could this be that you know and and so I went to pray and then as I'm I'm in there praying I'm like Lord I have this burden in my heart are you calling me to be a minister certainly you're not I mean there's no way I don't know enough I'm not able to do this there's no way I could help anybody you have to realize when I came to this church for the first time the Sunday school kids knew more about the Bible than I did I'd ask brother Jeremy I said brother I need a Bible study I don't know nothing you got to help me and so they helped me we had started having the Bible studies with brother Lonnie and so just in looking at that through my life I've recognized that you know God had purposes and he never was looking at my ability and that's the problem with us today we keep thinking as we're getting stronger we're getting more understanding we're getting things figured out no you're not you know you're you're you have no ability this has nothing to do with you remember it's not your Victory it's God's Victory it's Christ's victory in us it's not our ability and brother Brandon said there's one thing you must Master he said especially you young ministers is that is the thought of human ability you've got none and just as soon as you can conquer that then God can use you to conquer whatever obstacles are before you and so as I began to look at that and then I had went to prayer you know before I went on that trip with brother Chad I said Lord if you're calling me to the ministry I'm not able but if you're calling me will you confirm it on this trip and then when I went on the trip or the Chad couldn't go they send me there I cry I get sick I'm worn out I don't know what I'm doing I prefer paired the notes I lost the notes on the plane I said I'm a miserable nobody nothing good for nothing what in my world am I doing here God you know no notes don't know how to preach never preached before 750 kids first time you want me to minister this is impossible how could you possibly use me in any function to do anything good and then God came on the same and God just uses insufficiency uses weakness uses Brokenness uses stupidity I left my notes on the plane but he even ordained that I do believe just so that I wouldn't rely on anything I could even do I would just have to go up there and say Lord here I am if this is a flop it's not my fault I didn't orchestrate this but the Chad was supposed to be there he should have got his passport ready it's not my fault it's not my fault brother Chad's fault it's not my fault but there I was and then looking back at that and seeing how it's trained it it went it continued on I've never gotten to a point where I felt capable to ever minister to people even today I feel more or less confident in preaching than I did then and I says I don't I told Brother Chad is this supposed to get easier it's supposed to get better right you're supposed to you do something long enough and you get more confidence I can do this and you realize I can't I don't know what I'm doing Lord I need your help but I think that's kind of the secret to the Christian walk I don't think it's ever in your journey you say I've arrived I think that's why Paul said having not apprehended I pressed toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus I haven't grabbed what it is but there's something inside me pulling me towards it and brother Branham tells a little story about the stream you know and he says the stream that's bubbling all the time he says why are you bubbling all the time why are you bubbling is it because I drink from you is it because the deers he says no he says if that stream could tell you he said it's not me brother banham something behind me pushing me and I get to looking at my own life and I realize it's it's not me I never did anything I still can't can't do anything but something down on the inside it keeps pushing me keeps pulling me I don't know what it is it's his victory it's not mine I'm just along for the ride everyone I I and I and I've oh and I've I've just grown to love him so much more in that process it's not been easy it's constant there's difficulties there's struggles there's disappointments and it's all part of learning obedience through much suffering I want to walk with him I've always just wanted to walk with the Lord but I didn't you know like like we were talking about Fellowship there in the beginning the reason why we have fellowship with the Brethren is because we have things in common we could sit there and the one I think the brother oh what was that brother's name at the last sir brother Vernon's um Frank Francis we were sitting there he drove us in his awesome vehicle the brother the Filipino brother you know what was his name the brother the Filipino brother so we were sitting there talking to him and we were sitting at the table and I was sitting beside him and he started sharing with us a little bit that he was his wife was a Believer he was not a Believer he was a businessman and he was doing very very well but his wife is a Believer he didn't want nothing to do with it until he got cancer he said God tapped me tapped me got my attention he got a Cancer and then through that cancer he got desperate for God and through that little trial that tribulation that difficulty had awakened him to his sonship and sometimes God has to awaken you to your sonship it's not that you became a son you always were a son you just didn't know it and then God comes down your way like brother Brock you just didn't know it God just comes down your way and you have no idea what he's doing you don't feel worthy you're not capable it's because you're not and it God even sometimes that you go right on into making your bed in hell make bad decisions and you but God didn't forsake you in that he's right there with you even in hell you made your bed in hell it didn't you know if I Ascend to Heaven he's there if I make my bed in hell he's there so you make your own bed there you make your own bad decisions sometimes in your own pride and your own human ignorance or arrogance I should say and you make your own bed and you have to sleep in it but you know what God's still there and I love that about him he's been with me even in the mistakes I've made even in the discouragements I've had even many times I never wanted to preach again I'm like I don't want to preach I'm not good I can't do this and you get discouraged and you get down and yet he's still there he said it's okay my son's just having a bad day he'll come out of it you know and he's still there and I just love that about him he's never left me never forsook me he's still with us leading us guiding us through all life circumstances and difficulties he's still there and so as you begin to go on you get to seeing just how much I believe he's so present in our lives that sometimes we don't realize it and I think we should con we should consider it sometimes we're taking too many things for granted like just go back to your life see where you've come from I was looking back I'm thinking that dream and that situation there and it led to this and and I'm like what it's been going on for these last 40 years here I am today I never would have thought I'd sit in here and preach but it's something God for ordained never even would have thought that I could have recognized my day and its message I knew in my heart I was crying out you've heard that testimony go up on top of my roof something inside me saying Lord if I only knew where you were I'd climbed the highest mountain to find you I'd forsake everything and I'd come after you and here we are I wasn't looking for him he came looking for me he came looking for you you weren't looking for him he came looking for you like left to our own devices we will destroy ourselves if it isn't the grace and mercy of God watching over you each and every day of your life you will utterly destroy yourself one day you're finished God ever removes his hand of grace and mercy and protection on life you're done you are done this has nothing to do with our ability we've got no ability that's the great Victory is that God found a people that recognized they got no ability in this thing that's where I think that God's Great Victory is coming into view it's that he found a people that are the bride what makes them the bride they're humble they're broken they're Meek they they love because they found another we found another little sister Hattie right a broken poor simple woman that believed at the hearing of the word that ain't nothing but the truth and so then hearing saying the right word at the right time in the presence of the right person she was just the right kind of woman for the third pole Ministry to be manifest and here we are looking at another time God found another woman she's simple she's broken she knows it she's good for nothing then God gives her the opportunity have whatever you want but she'll say the right thing she'll ask for something Eternal not for something carnal not something to satisfy this own Earthly Journey she's going to look and call for the right thing something that has an eternal perspective about it so it just makes you look a little higher and it brings a little bit greater rest for each and every one of us because I'm recognizing that this is God working amongst us it's not me it's him and so it just it's just an interesting thing to see that what God has been doing in each of our lives through these years we're learning just as just has anybody arrived yet like is Emma no good we have Fellowship we all find we're failures we're all failures but I'm just so glad that he found failures uh like us and he could take our failures and be our strength he could have a victim will the bride have a great ministry oh yes but it'll be so humble so simple so so common to the world to look at it and say there's nothing to that person and here you don't even realize there's a manifested Son of God who just came to himself one day like that prodigal son you know he left as a son and he he when he left as a son and he was down in the pig's pen he came to himself and when he came to himself and he was going to go back to his father he didn't go with the mindset I am the son he went as a servant and when he realized he was nothing he could just maybe in the eyes of his father come back to him as a servant the father restored him as his son and I'm finding my own life is going through that same process you know and you you find out you're a Son of God by God's grace he awakens you and and you're so excited but then even you make your own mistakes and you make your own bed in hell you make bad decisions and God doesn't forsake you he just lets you wrestle it out eat the pig pen wait for the grace of God to come your way opens your eyes and say what am I doing here where did I go and God in his grace you'll then go to the father with your head bowled I'm sure that son when he came back in the with the attitude of a certain he didn't come say watch out everybody I'm the son get out of the way that's why I don't like that arrogant attitude I am the Bride of Jesus Christ get out of my way don't don't ever take that attitude I think the attitude of the Bride of Jesus Christ is so humble so Meek so broken so understanding of the grace and mercy of God and lies that had nothing to do with you it was Grace Grace to you that's why we can stand and you know the angels will won't understand us they can never understand this Plan of Redemption they won't be able to sing it like we can sing it because we know none of us will have a problem on that day of taking off our crowns and throwing it at his feet because we know we had nothing to do with this I'm not great there's nothing good with me it was the grace of God that made me a son I'm just his grace I am just his victory on this Earth and so I don't believe there's any boasting in the bride I believe Revelation humbles you down I believe education understanding and information will puff you up but if it's Revelation it produces the life of Jesus Christ in you and you become submitted to doing the father's will not your own and then that's what always I I I don't want to preach on it because that's a whole big subject but one of the things I had preached on when I was there was Ascension by condescension and I was looking at almighty God as here as Brother Band said here's almighty God he was so great so powerful he had to look down to see the heavens and but but when he manifested and came in the flesh he went to the lowest city in the country and the shortest man in the city Zacchaeus brother Brahma dramatizes said he had to climb up on a garbage can to get up on a tree and the shortest man in the city was looking down on the king of glory so you see that God in what God condescended he kept coming down when you've seen him in flesh it was a condescension of God and then he came so low that he even went down into hell condescended all the way down to Hell took the keys of death hell and the gray and redeemed it and then he even condescended even more and came down into this hell this life this mud and this muck of my life this failure this miserable Heathen boy and he condescended the greatness of God condescended all the way down to reach down and pick you up pick me up what a condescension this is this is a great condescension and then I began to realize so God then you know God wanting Fellowship is this okay I hope it's okay like I have I don't have notes I'm just talking I told you and so like God wanting Fellowship you have to have things in common right we have to have things in common for a husband and wife to have good Fellowship they have to have things in common for two brothers have to have Fellowship we have to have things in common have to understand each other right so God condescended from the highest Heights he said this whole Plan of Redemption is really for the purpose of Fellowship God wanted fellowship with his attributes right and so God stepped out of Eternity came into time loud for a fall so that we could go through the process of of life and difficulties and so God wanting to understand us he became a man brother bam said he went through pain rejection he got sick he went through all of that so we could he could understand us but then God so now we have to understand God so you have to look at that's God understand us but what about us understanding God so then God lifts you up out of the mud of the muck you find out you're a son of almighty God a manifested attribute of God himself on Earth but what does it do to you you then go through a process of suffering and rejection and despisement and ridicule so that you can understand what he went through so then as he lifts you up you by your own choosing began to condescend out you see what I'm saying so it's an Ascension by condescension it's not how big we are it's how little we can go because brother man said only big men can become little only a big man not a little man a little man can't can't do that but a big man he can do that and so and okay I gotta come now I got a quote now I have a quote I just did I got a quote so brother bam says in crisis and Ministry says oh if I could just get the world to see this there you are there's the body of Christ Living standing a redeemed oh my justified in his sight why why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in these last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose we are the proof of that Victory amen when I see him coming down and living amongst his church that's his victory showing that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can he keep us that's right we are already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever he's alive everyone we're not pointing to an empty tune of 2000 years ago we're pointing to living Epistles that have been raised up out of Creeds and denominations you don't think it was a big deal that God's been raising up his body you don't think it's a big deal that God spoke the word called you out of dead denominationalism Dead traditions of your man your own human pride and he pulled you up out of that lifted you up why he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a living Risen Savior this Church of the Living God is the proof of his resurrection not to point to an empty tune of 2000 years ago but to see the body of Jesus Christ manifested attributes of his grace living Epistles red of all men condescending from the highest Heights becoming the lowest of lowest and of individuals gods and flesh again but remember when God's in flesh it's never ascending it's never saying look at me remember where that attitude came from that's a spirit that's an antichrist spirit that becomes something look at me I'm the big one I have the great understanding I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ remember who ascended who wasn't content with their position Lucifer Lucifer wasn't content in the position that he had as the right hand of God he wanted to be a little bit more you see that that discernist lust that he had to be a little bit better just a little bit better than God and to exalt his his position above the stars of God you see what he was doing with that attitude he was a beast and when he tried to go up he went to the pits of hell let's see the difference here we are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus The Virtuous body of Jesus Christ manifested on Earth the attributes of God but watch what you'll do in this life watch God in flesh God in flesh doesn't make himself big God and flesh makes himself little because only a big man can get little and that's what we're finding out so Brad have a great ministry yeah but so humble so simple remember when they lifted him up it struck me years ago I shared with brother Jeremy when God lifted him up before all the people how was he lifted up on a cross that's how God lifted him up before the people and waved him before the people what was it a man that submitted his will to God's will he said not my will be done but thine will be done God and God lifted him up as an example before the people what was it a man that chose to do the will of God he fought it out in the Garden of Gethsemane and he dripped great drops of blood as he began to say it's not my will there's any way for this cup to pass me by but it's not my will it's God's will be done so he chose his own crucifixion he chose his own crucifixion then the question comes to the Bride of Jesus Christ you have to choose your own crucifixion who whosoever seeks to save his life is going to lose it whosoever lose his life for my sake he'll have it right and so now we're in this process of choosing because thou has chosen the harder way thou has walked in thine owned choosing thou has chosen the correct and precise way and it is my way right so you have to make some certain choices along this journey you've got to make some harder choices that will humiliate you and debase you for his glory every one of us are here we all have decisions we can be making on a regular basis I don't believe that it's the easier way like I even said that to some of the young Minister I don't know who it was I was talking to him at brother June I said hey be careful um you know if you God's calling to the ministry and I says here's something that's going to happen and he started telling me about a job opportunity that he had and I said be really careful with that I know that looks like that's a good thing because it looks like God's blessing you with a greater job but you also know that God called you the ministry so right at the time God's calling to you the ministry you get this great opportunity I says be careful that may not be God there because remember you have to choose the harder way and it just I've learned in my own life own situations that I've I've made big boo-boon mistakes it seems like God's pulling me here here comes a great opportunity and just be careful you have to be aware of those things wherever the spirit of God's moving Antichrist Spirits right there beside it working too and that's just something we've learned right in this in this journey and so and brother Branham also said this um and brother Chad was talking about that wave she he said as Christ was on that was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be another wave Chief again in the last days oh my the waving of a Sheaf what is the Sheaf it's the first one that come to maturity and the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah I'm sure that you know what I'm talking about it was waived over the people the first time there will come forth in the bride age a resurrection out of dark denominations there will be a message that the full maturity of the word has been turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders as he had back there because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live what a resurrection that was what a resurrection that this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by the quickening power of God and I was listening I read it is the rising of the sun on the way back there brother Brandon was talking about that quickening power that quickening power he said if you look at that quickening power he says Enoch obeyed every word he says Elijah obeyed every word and as he was they were walking in the Simplicity of just obeying every word quickening power came and then you begin to look at job and I was considering job and his his own condescension it looked like when job was uh okay so did it look like God job was getting closer to God when he lost all of his children everyone dies all of his wealth goes away loses all of his businesses all his friends turn against him even his wife says your breath is strange unto me he lost the reputation of life is he getting closer to God or farther away job's going down but all the way as he got all the way down into that position what happens he says then he saw a revelation of the Resurrection that in his flesh he should seek God so as he was going down he was going up as Joseph was getting thrown into the pit and then cast into slavery and then going into prison was he getting closer to the throne or farther away from the throne he was closer to the throne you think about that right so in every one of these situations you can pick one up after another one look at the Hebrew children as they were walking closer to the fire with every step the fire is heated up seven times in their own choosing of their own destruction were they going farther away from God or were they just entering into the presence of God they were getting ready to walk right into the reality of a living God the Fourth Man manifested in himself in the presence of his people as they were choosing their own death they made their own choice you chose your own destruction but actually it was your Resurrection it was the resurrected Jesus Christ drawing close to you as you were going down and I've just found this to be the pattern it's the pattern that God has always restored Fellowship in is when you choose to die on your cross when you choose to be debased humiliated made fun of rejected spit at and you do nothing you say nothing you don't even defend yourself you don't have a reason to why because it's Christ in you remember when Christ was manifested in the flesh they made fun of him they ripped his beard out they spit at him they spoke all manner of evil against him they accused him falsely and he opened not his mouth there's God in flesh there's power on display he had all the power to change the scene and he did nothing but what the father showed him what to do he wasn't ever defending himself he wasn't trying to deliver himself he chose his own death for our Victory and so now I'm getting to choose my own death for his victory and so it's just the most amazing thing another Bantam says here he says um oh yeah he says now if we if they have to have a crew they have to have a crucifixion before you can have a resurrection and before the church will ever able to be able to see a resurrected power before you can ever see a new ministry take place in myself before you can even enter into a new fellowship with God there has got to be a self-crucifixion so that there can come a resurrection you've got to die out to your thoughts you've got to die out to your ways you got to die out to everything that's around us and go through the trials and the tribulations that we might see a new resurrection and a new life before a sinner can become a Christian he has to die then a resurrection isn't that interesting my so the next time your trial comes your difficulty your rejection your persecution comes just embrace it don't even defend don't even try to escape it God's ordained it for a greater expression of the resurrected power of Jesus Christ displayed in our lives it's just something interesting how many are craving more of a resurrected quickening power in your life to help you Quicken yourself to I am I really really am and now I'm realizing ah okay there's a little key die okay with every little decision God gives me these two options one will be the harder way one will be the easier way I'm gonna choose the hard way because I know the harder way will lead me closer into his presence I just know that that's the truth so that's my honest heart's desires just help me to crawl upon this uh cross you know D.L Moody made the comment he says the problem with the Living Sacrifice he's always trying to crawl off the altar that's the problem with a Living Sacrifice he always wants to defend himself he always wants to preserve his life it's hard to die everyone it's just hard to die and to live every day with that in mind Paul says I Die daily I Die daily every time I wake up in the morning I got my choice either live for Christ or live for Kyle which disorder decision do I get to make we each all got these choices we all have these decisions to make hope this is okay okay sorry uh will you turn to Philip uh yeah I almost said Philippines Philippians I got Philippines on my mind Philippians chapter 3 verse 10. and musicians why don't you come um Philippians chapter 3 verse 10. I I truly in this life I really truly just want the fellowship with the Lord and have fellowship with his attributes that's all I'm craving at this point I'm I'm not I don't I never have desired to be considered a great Minister a great person I just want to walk with the lord it's all my heart's desire has been since I was a kid so and uh so whatever God's got to do to get us in that position that's the only thing I'm interested in at this point and so it says in Philippians 3 10 it says that I may know him and the power of his resurrection listen And The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death you see if you want to know the power of his resurrection you must understand the fellowship of his sufferings you're never going to see a resurrected Jesus Christ in the power fully displayed in you unless you can embrace the sufferings that God has ordained for your life I want to know him he wanted to know me I want to understand him I want that basis of fellowship with my Lord and he's just ordained the right amount of situations the rejections the right things to happen in this life so I can know him I can understand him and he can understand me that's that's what he wanted that relationship between a husband and wife but the band says sometimes in life you have tensions you have really difficult times he says but when it's all said and done the tensions are over husband and wife can Embrace each other with more of a love and understanding of the other person than they ever did before he says let the one disappoint the other one this one disappoint this and but let them come back together then they'll understand each other and love each other more than ever before and now I'm seeing that God set this whole basis of Fellowship in place this whole Plan of Redemption this whole desire that he had Fellowship he wanted fellowship with me wanted fellowship with you and so God in his mercies just ordained just the right trial the right sufferings the right disappointments the right rejections for you so that you can understand him because if your ultimate desires just to know him so you can walk with him then this is all part of the plan everyone this is just part of the plan don't be discouraged don't get upset don't run away it's all part of the plan of God you have to remember you ever think about like yeah what like why are we here like what what are we doing I I I come to church to find my bad spots I come to to be corrected I come to hear from God because I want to know him and I'm not wanting to know about him I want to know him and so in understanding knowing him I gotta walk as he walked I gotta go through the things he went through I gotta suffer the way he suffered and never work to defend myself I just have to embrace it I have to say Okay Lord now I get to climb up on that cross I'm not going to fight it anymore just crucify me if that's what you want crucify me kill the vessel because I really just always wanted to walk with him just wanted that fellowship with the lord it's all I've ever desired so you see that I may know him in the power of His Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I may might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect look at the attitude of Paul but I follow after that I might apprehend that from which I have I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and Reaching Forward are those things that are before I press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus how many are going to press I'm pressing I'm reaching out I'm going to actually embrace the sufferings and trials that God's ordained for me because I know I'm going to see a greater Resurrection in this flesh as I do so won't you stand hope it's okay I just shared my heart nothing in my head just stuff in my heart and I pray that it was for the glory of God and it was a help to you all this evening and I just love him I really love him appreciate the prayers on the trip and I looking forward to what he has in store for us it may not look good it may not look so comfortable but it's going to be the very thing that brings us right into his presence this the the the heat of the fire mate gets seven times hotter may get pretty intense but just remember you're going to walk right into his presence it looks like a fire but just who's in the fire is my question who's in that fire when Daniel you know the question went for Daniel hey we're going to kill you if you bow your head and pray you know this right we're going to kill you never stop you let me just open the door about his head began to pray he chose his own physical destruction because he wanted fellowship with God and as he wanted to maintain that fellowship with God he knew it would cost him his life they grabbed him they throw him into a pit but who was in the pit the angel of the Lord was there to shut the mouth of the Lions he went gotten thrown into the pit when he was ready to sacrifice his will in his own life to maintain fellowship with the Lord those Hebrew children they weren't going to Bow the knee they were not going to compromise with this world no way they were going to say that's okay if God wants to deliver us he will if he doesn't my destruction that's fine but they found him in the middle of the fire job found him as a Risen Savior and now the Bride of Jesus Christ choosing her own condescension her own destruction she's going to find him again in the very midst of her life a resurrected Jesus living and moving and acting in each and every one of us don't you love him I I don't know what else to say I just I I just love him Luke says and he said unto them if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will seek save his life will lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall save it amen let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer most gracious heavenly father thank you thank you for what you've done thank you what you're doing thank you for what is to come I'm so honored Lord and privileged to look back in my life and recognize that there was one walking with me in the pits of hell and my Hyatts of heights are in the deepest of my loaves Thou Art there father it's just it's it's more than words to me it's a reality it's no more scripture verses that I read about it I I find myself in the book I found myself identified in the pages of the Bible I found myself as one that by your grace you get to walk with and talk to and and correct and spank and guide Lord what would I have done if there wasn't a rod and a staff to correct us what would we have done where would we be if you would not have come on the scene for each and every one of us father so father God as you've you've lifted us up into Heavenly places father God seated now our position in Christ Lord we recognize who we are father may we humbly bow our heads and servants and say we're unprofitable servants Lord let us just be faithful all to the things you've caught us to do to be the kind of person you've called us to be let us take up our cross each and every day so that we can understand you and you can understand us and have that Fellowship that we so earnestly desire father we thank you for what you've done we thank you for what you're doing thank you for the brothers in the Philippines I pray Lord that your blessings would rest upon each and every one of them thank you for their lives their living Epistles father that encouraged me courage brother Chad to see their lives and their love one for the other father be with us may may when the world looks at us they'll wonder wow they have such a love one for the other Lord may they see that in each and every one of us Lord we're nothing special it's just a great God we're your Victory father and we so appreciate that and we love you for it be with everyone tonight as they travel home may they find you Faithfully in the morning as they go to seek you whether we know that we'll find you we love you we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen maybe we'll just sing a song brother you got a song on your heart Because He Lives oh I can fade tomorrow [Music] because I know yet I am behold the feud [Music] and I like just because [Music] we live tomorrow [Music] please [Music] all fear is gone because I know yes I saw he holds the future and like his word the lady trust he [Music] will be because [Music] I know yes I know younger and life is worth the living foreign amen aren't you glad he came to you we never could have found him we never could have found his location or where he was or how to climb that high we weren't capable came down and it should cause us to want to come down for others amen for someone else you know and I appreciate that it was amazing how we you know took the service I think it was I think Brother Kyle was 45 minutes late to that service I think it was 45 minutes late they walked in they actually had to to walk in I was in the middle of preaching they had to walk up the middle aisle come around behind and sit down so I just turned around and greeted him and shook their hands because there was no way to coordinate the effort you know there was no way to piece this together and what Kyle was supposed to say at the beginning were those thoughts that he had and I told him later I said it actually worked way better as a capping than it did as a foundation God knew how to place it and what was amazing is everybody could see it we could see that you know God was in control and it all worked out just perfect and it ended up being a tremendous blessing the the capping that that God had given to Brother Kyle and you know Kyle was probably a little nervous in traffic probably just a little frustrated and then this frustration that being late probably passed away when he felt like he didn't have to preach at all so frustration probably turned to Joy and then when he found out at the end brother Danny gave him like 30 seconds notice you're gonna go ahead and speak but we saw God in all of it and we can see God in things like traffic being laid how much more so in everything that happens in our lives when did God get amnesia and forget about us when did God forget where we were when did he look away and not notice we had just got in trouble you know that's our perspective we feel like God didn't see and now we're in a panic mode and God doesn't know and I've got to call God down on the scene right now no God never lost his it never took his eye off you he never lost what was happening everything's under control if we can just stay humble and submissive God will work it all out man I tell you it was a wonderful trip for me it had been four years almost four years since I've been to the Philippines and you know covet had changed so many meetings and so many appointments to get back together and see the Brethren again it refreshed a joy a refreshed a fellowship it was very refreshing to me and I realized these brothers had become such close friends to me brother Nestor and brother Danny brother Vernon brother June uh Brother Don Don and brother Aaron and brother Val I mean these aren't just names of Brothers on the other side of the planet these are dear friends to me and to go back and see them again and see how God had blessed them over the last four years they had prospered spiritually and did prospered physically The Works that they were doing were growing the outreaches were continuing people are still coming to the Lord people are still receiving the message it's a wonderful thing and it just was a rejuvenation for me to see it all continuing on and it made me you know want to do more I want to do more I want to do more than I've done to watch what they do always inspires me to want to do more and like uh Brother Kyle was saying when I first went to Mindanao and many of you remember went there many years ago and preached in the prisons there remember the pictures of baptizing the inmates in a 55 gallon plastic drum when I went there I believe there was three churches there three maybe four and they've been working since that time getting the word out and now there's 34 churches I say praise God I'm so encouraged that God is still finding his children that the work goes on and I want to just continue to do our part and just pray for them pray that God will continue to bless them we want to do what we can we want to still be a help to them and the missions efforts we want to help them do what they're doing and so we we're going to continue doing that by the grace of God we all work together God bless you thank you for praying for us thank you for standing behind us thank you for your support and missions amen we don't not every one of us get to go and see but those who get to go and see come back and say it's a blessing it's a blessing and thank you for all you do and all of the Brethren wanted us to greet you everybody wanted us to greet you and say God bless you and they appreciate what you've given what you've done brother Nestor and his wife sister Hannah they really appreciate their home and many here contributed to that Amen Brother Don Don was so grateful brother Erin and brother Val they all want to say thank you in the show their appreciation and I'm blessed to be able to say that in June brother Vernon is planning to come the United States I asked him to stop by so brother Vernon will get to stop by and see us in June and if all goes well in July brother Nestor will make it here so be praying that God works all those details out so we can see them here again amen how many are blessed let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you so much so appreciate God seeing how you orchestrate things that we could not have figured out things that we could not have orchestrated you have a way of moving all the pieces you have a way of making your plan work in our lives even without our understanding sometimes we're not comprehending many things many times what's going on what's happening in our lives God you're teaching us if we could just abase ourselves and stay humble and stay low and trust in you and have confidence in you not in ourselves then those things we can't figure out those things that might even cause us some anxiety or fear if we can just lay ourselves in your hand and trust you you will work them all out that you have a plan I thank you Lord for the ability to come and bring a good report from afarland showing all is well there all is well here that you're in full control that the message is going on and that you're growing your children into your very likeness trial by trial word by word revelation upon revelation God what you're doing and our brothers and sisters overseas you're doing in us here oh we're so thankful for that help us to stay yielded and humble and submitted as you work out Redemption for God you're displaying your victory your Victory and the purpose of your death is to have a bride of your own choosing at the end time standing In Your Glory not something we can do but only something we can surrender to God we're trusting in you to make it all happen in our lives bless us as we go from here bless our Brethren Lord back in the Philippines use them continue to use them and show us ways in which we can help Lord we love you we ask for your blessings as we depart in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen remember before we sing I just want to share one thing that motorcycle that Brother Kyle showed you the picture of uh brother James there he he rides these motorcycles over rivers up mountains where there's no road to take the gospel to churches to go and encourage churches and brother Nestor during his anniversary the The Collection he wanted to take he wanted that collection to go to that motorcycle and so what brother Nestor says is he told everybody there is we want to give we want to give to help these brothers go farther and brother Nestor says nobody gives zero nobody gives zero and and when he said that it just struck me with impact we're speaking to a group of people at an anniversary meeting some are our corporate employees and have good jobs some are from America we have finances some are tricycle drivers we drive a tricycle motorcycle Taxi some have a lot some have very little some have next to nothing and our tendency is to let he who has more give and don't put the burden on but brother Nestor said nobody gives zero because in giving is a blessing and I thought what a lesson there should be none of us giving zero zero effort zero to the body of Christ zero to the work of the lord we should all have something to give and in giving there's always a blessing and so they gave they all gave everybody gave whether it was a peso or two or more and we were able to give some fun some funds that this church contributed to we were able to carry that over and give also and there was enough to buy the motorcycle and say let that be let that be a lesson that we take away that nobody give zero let us nobody come to church and just be a taker that day let nobody be part of the fellowship and we're always the ones to receive let us also find a way to do and nobody gives zero I mean that comes from a brother who's been a missionary and a pastor for decades and I say that's good God help me to be found at the end of The Journey not just a taker but let me never give zero let me always give something amen God bless you as you go it's been good good to be home good to see your faces good to worship together amen I appreciate the word this evening brother Ben oh all is well we oh and away oh for there is a place days rest behind the innervous [Music] oh yes all is well good for We Have Heard [Music] [Music] there is a perfect rest [Music] Resort [Music] for all one more time and all
