========================================

he is the same yesterday today and forever he's alive everyone we're not pointing to an empty tune of 2000 years ago we're pointing to living Epistles that have been raised up out of Creeds and denominations you don't think it was a big deal that God's been raising up his body you don't think it's a big deal that God spoke the word called you out of dead denominationalism Dead traditions of your man your own human pride and he pulled you up out of that lifted you up why he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a living Risen Savior this Church of the Living God is the proof of his resurrection not to point to an empty tune of 2000 years ago but to see the body of Jesus Christ manifested attributes of his grace living Epistles red of all men condescending from the highest Heights becoming the lowest of lowest and of individuals gods and flesh again but remember when God's in flesh it's never ascending it's never saying look at me remember where that attitude came from that's a spirit that's an antichrist spirit that becomes something look at me I'm the big one I have the great understanding I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ remember who ascended who wasn't content with their position Lucifer Lucifer wasn't content in the position that he had as the right hand of God he wanted to be a little bit more you see that that discernist lust that he had to be a little bit better just a little bit better than God and to exalt his his position above the stars of God you see what he was doing with that attitude he was a beast and when he tried to go up he went to the pits of hell let's see the difference here we are already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus The Virtuous body of Jesus Christ manifested on Earth the attributes of God but watch what you'll do in this life watch God in flesh God in flesh doesn't make himself big God and flesh makes himself little because only a big man can get little and that's what we're finding now so Brad have a great ministry yeah but so humble so simple remember when they lifted him up it struck me years ago I shared with brother Jeremy when God lifted him up before all the people how was he lifted up on a cross that's how God lifted him up before the people and waved him before the people what was it a man that submitted his will to God's will he said not my will be done but thine will be done God and God lifted him up as an example before the people what was it a man that chose to do the will of God he fought it out in the Garden of Gethsemane and he dripped great drops of blood as he began to say it's not my will if there's any way for this cup to pass me by but it's not my will it's God's will be done
