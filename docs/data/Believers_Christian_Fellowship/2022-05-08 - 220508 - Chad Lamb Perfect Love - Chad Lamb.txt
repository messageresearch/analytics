god's been good to us i've been greeting the brothers and saying happy mother's day to you too because we all had a mother amen so it's a special day we wouldn't none of us be on this earth without a mother and so we we are thankful for that i wanted to uh give you a little update i got a phone call from brother abraham myra and he got his visa on friday so everything is set the plans are set the tickets are booked and he's planning on being here for the meetings from the 20th to the 22nd and also i spoke with brother donovan and brother donovan would like to host he and his wife would like to host a men's fellowship breakfast that saturday morning the 21st of the weekend of the meetings at 9 30 a.m and right now it's it's scheduled to be at brother donovan's home unless the crowd is too large so so they have an idea of how many to expect they put a sign up sheet out on the welcome desk so if you could please if any of the brothers who were planning on attending that breakfast if you could just sign up out on that sheet at the welcome desk by next sunday so they can get a head count and make their final plans also i'm sure nobody's asked but i'm sure sister stephanie would appreciate any help if any sister would like to help or contribute i'm sure you can talk to them so if you have any questions see brother donovan and so we're thankful for them hosting that we're looking forward to having a good time and a good weekend and i thank god that he worked out all the plans amen god is certainly good to us amen i'd like to while we're standing take our bibles and turn to first john chapter 4. i mean the lord dropped a thought into my heart and i was astounded at how all the messages have worked together this morning i like to preach on perfect love and i was just meditating on mother's day and god just tied these two things together for me so nicely and when i when i when i got done meditating on what the lord dropped in my heart i was astounded at how perfect everything fits in the place almost like somebody orchestrated all the services through statue of a perfect man to end on brotherly kindness on love on mother's day to preach on perfect love and i tell you i was the most shocked of us all i'm like boy god you're good amen so i'm just so happy and so thankful so we want to come to this service grateful to the lord's leadership amen first john chapter 4 verse 16. and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love we don't let the soak in this is we're not now we're not talking about emotion now we're not talking about a feeling because god is so much more than an emotion or a feeling whatever love is it's god whatever god is it's love this is the kind of love that we're after god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him so this is the love that we're supposed to live in and it's supposed to live in us herein is our love made perfect so how is our love made perfect because we live in that love and that love lives in us so we know we're in god and god's in us hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen god bless you as you have your seats he wants god to bless us as we look into this word also amen so we know we love him because he first loved us so if he didn't first love us it means it'd be impossible to love him back so no matter how much we feel that we love god and and we were wanting to find god and wanting to know god our love we know is only a reciprocal love it's only reciprocating to his love he loved us first and if he didn't love us first and we weren't already the object of his love then there would be no way for us to love him back amen so that that is such a consolation for us because if in the depths of your soul you know that you love god and that you want god and want him above everything else what a consolation because where did that love come from that love can only be reciprocating a love that was already extended to you before the foundation of the world so what a comfort that is to us to know that we love him because he loved us first so if he didn't love his first we could never love him and god is love so if we dwell in love we dwell in god and god in us herein is our love made perfect that word perfect means brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completion a complete full love comes when we dwell in him we dwell in this love if we dwell in this love because god is love we dwell in him and he and us hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is we are in this world why because he's in us and he is love and his love's in us and as he is so are we in this world amen so we it says here there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment i think in the end time this is what makes the bride of jesus christ such a unique people on the face of the planet because the whole world is afraid i mean the entire world is fearful right now and uh and we were talking with some brothers about the level of mental illness is just absolutely off the charts right now and it's because the the media has done a fantastic job through code of frightening everybody to death and people were on a they were on the edge they were on a hare's breath from insanity to begin with and then you pump a ton of fear into them and then what now people are just snapping amen not one at a time but in mass people are just going insane and the world wonders why i mean there's a new endemic amen that's that's mental illness and they wonder what it is it's because you've sown fear into them for for years and years and years and and you sown that fear into them in order to control them but now you've lost control because they lost their minds but brother branham said the world will go totally insane and the only sane people on this planet will be the bride of jesus christ because fear hath torment and the whole world is afraid people under that torment are snapping amen but love perfect love cast out fear so you have a people who have the ability to have a sound mind by the love of god amen this love is is very unique uh it's we know it's agapo or agapo in love brother venom talks about this the difference between that and filio love and if you go to the concordance to strong's concordance and begin to look at this word agape when you look at the word it references you to filio love and in there there's a little write-up it's very unique that it's even in there it's a little write-up from a german scholar that lived right at the turn of the century and and basically what he's describing the difference between agapo love and filio love just like brother branham did only i like the way that it's worded here he says the verb agapen is the love of intelligence reason comprehension coupled with the corresponding purpose i want you to catch that it's much different than the love the emotional love that we've learned to call love what we talk about is love brother venom attaches that to affiliate love which is an emotional type love which is like a friendship love and a family love and a love for individuals but this love is different kind of love than that because that love is based on emotions feelings this love is not based on any emotions the word of god is the love of intelligence reason comprehension coupled with the corresponding purpose in this it is it its content is vastly outranks the other type of love and filian expresses the love of mere personal affection or liking including even the passions where the context requires and no intelligence or high purpose is involved this content places the verb on a low level it could never be said of god that hephilia the sinful world as far as philian is concerned he could only abominate the foul world jesus never asked us to love our enemies in the sense of filian he never himself loved his enemies this way but agape yes with this love did god love the world and we can love our enemies comprehending all that is wrong sanctifying the world converting our enemies compare john 3 16 and every other passage in which either of the verbs is used in this gospel only in a few cases where either type of love would apply either verb might be used but even then the great distinction would remain the two are never equal i really enjoyed that this is what brother benham described so many times he talked about the difference you know even he said filio love amen would cause a man in anger for somebody who violated his wife he'll he'll in turn and go and kill that man that's that's philly and love because it's passion it's love it's feeling amen but he says agapo love will make you pray for him that his soul would be saved it's so different because it's a level i would say agapo love is impossible without revelation because it's a love of intelligence and understanding and it ties in the corresponding purpose that god has a purpose and all of that amen and his love is projected in all of that so it's not and it's a wonderful thing amen that god had agapo love for the children of israel because the bible many times said he was angry with them if he had filio love when he was angry with them there's no way he could continue to work with them amen and continue to protect them amen i'm sure that you know we do things that anger the lord because god can get angry he gets angry with sin he gets angry with these things but i'm so glad god's love is not an emotional love it's a higher love than that amen and it's a love of understanding god has the intelligence the understanding to know his purpose and who is who and what he's doing and the whole plan of god with corresponding purpose and he loves with understanding amen and he's asking us to come to a higher love not just emotional amen and that sometimes you know uh emotional love is a part of it brother branham says if you have a religion without emotion i would bury it it's dead because even agapo love can produce emotion but it's not based on emotion right because god has emotion god expresses emotion in the word but his love towards us is not based on emotion based on a higher order so we don't want to say we don't want to have any emotion that would be a horrible way to serve the lord i love when the presence of the lord sweets in and it begins to draw tears out of my eyes and i love him so much and i feel it amen i love that i love those experiences i never want them to go away amen but even when i'm not feeling that i still love god and he still loves me so we never want to say it's unemotional there better be some emotion amen there better be something because god has emotion he's built us with emotions so that's not what we're talking about but we're going to talk about something that's not based on the emotions because it will fluctuate all the time it's got to be higher than that it's got to be deeper than that it must be stronger than that so god is love amen in perfect love casts out fear so we want to talk about perfect love today amen and and brother venom had some really interesting things to say and and i'd like to say as we begin you know brother brenham was good at telling stories amen he told a lot of stories and he would tie a lot of things into his sermons and he would be preaching away and all of a sudden he would go into a story amen and used to years back when i first come into the message i enjoyed hearing all the stories and then i got to where i wanted to learn the doctrine and so i would be skipping through the stories to get to where he tells the doctor and missing the whole point that brother banner's ministry was a reflection of the son of man and when jesus was here in order to teach his disciples he began telling stories and they're not stories they're parables and brother benham stories are not stories they're parables so if you want to understand what he's preaching you better pay attention to the story not skip through it to try to get the doctrine because the doctrine's in the story amen amen brother branham he begins to address mother's day and he says mother is so great you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she bears you under her heart and she's the first to know you and the first in this life to hold you so so sisters amen when when the new baby comes and wants to get passed around to all the family members just realize that you've had almost 10 months to hold that baby man we want to turn too amen so don't get don't get upset amen and was the first to know you in the first in this life to hold you and when you're born she's one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears of your eyes she is the first one to pat you and to love you and to coo over you in this life is your mother now i think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother mother is first with child and she's a great responsibility of what that child would be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from god to place that child on the right road and i think that's why mothers has a special little place brother bannon begins to teach us as the bible teaches us that motherhood parenthood together mother and fatherhood is an expression of the nature of god because god is a father amen and and so this this motherhood brother ben begins to tie it in as an expression of god an expression of god's love because even as the bible types it there is no greater bond of human love than that for a mother with her infant and the bible begins to express this and tie this and show that god's love is greater than that and so brother ben begins to use it as a type to begin to show amen the love of god he goes on to say in blind bartimaeus i tell you the thoughts of a good christian mother is a treasure to a human heart that's never forgotten so if you've got a good christian mother it's a treasure that should never be forgotten then he goes on and starts talking about the condition of the world he says the beautiful virtue that god give a woman to be a mother has been marred and i can say it's been destroyed and the culture that we live in today it's been marred and that's the backbone of the nation you break motherhood and you broke the nation right then that's one thing that helps hold it together real genuine parenthood because real genuine parenthood is a reflection of god god is displayed in family god is a father he had a son amen the son is going to have a bride that that bride is supposed to reproduce amen so god and family is reflecting his own plan and his own character and his own nature is is reflected in family life so there's a reflection even in motherhood of the love of god and like i said the one of the strongest bonds on earth is the bond between a mother and her infant and brother branham's just talking about how the the you break motherhood you break the nation and that's what we've seen there's so many excuses for why the country is in the condition that it's in and you watch and there's economic reasons and there's all kinds of political reasons and everybody wants to blame somebody else and the real problem is is the breakdown of the pulpits not to hold the word of god before the people that's what's wrong with the country you can say republican you can say democrat you can say uh you can say white house you can say supreme court you can say whatever you want to say and all of those are just effects of the cause but the cause was leaving the word of god and so that's why i mean right now it doesn't matter who you vote for i know some people still get tied up and republicans are more godly than democrats and blah blah blah it's a bunch of rubbish absolute rubbish because none of them are bringing the word of god back amen and the only hope is the word of god not a political party not an idea not conservativism because conservativism is still devoid of the word but it's the word and when we dropped a men motherhood motherhood was part of the word amen fatherhood was part of the word when they when they when they put the mother into the workforce when they split up the home when they created daycares they began to destroy the word of god and it began to break from there and everywhere else that's not the only thing that broke but so many things broke down because it was the breakdown brother ben instead of pulpits that was the problem so until you get all the pulpits preaching the word again you're not going to vote anything that's going to fix america it's finished it's absolutely the prophet said it's finished it's finished it's finished because they turned their back on the word they rejected the lord and when they rejected the lord and rejected the word then motherhood began broken fatherhood was broken family was broken church began to be broken everything's been broken since then so i thank god that under the word amen but under the word that's been restored it's also restored motherhood it's restored fatherhood it's restored family it's restored relationships it's restored all of these things amen so many people we've talked before they they they've told me in the past when all of our kids were little we would have family members tell us you're so lucky your kids are so well behaved [Music] and i just used to marvel at that well i said well apparently you're a pretty unlucky person you know but it wasn't luck it was the word of god because we didn't know what we were doing we just did what the word said do and it works amen when when the word puts fatherhood in place and motherhood and place and respect between the two and respect to the children children respect to the parents and respect amen in the churches to one another amen you can begin to see that the families that we see they're not a reflection of good carnal teaching they're not a reflection of somebody trying better with a better idea the family life that you see is a reflection of the word of god being exalted to its position and then god is expressing himself through family amen and so brother i'm saying the the breakdown of motherhood and and he's standing in his yard and he is having a conversation about a story that took place in jeffersonville where a young unwed woman became pregnant and she had a baby and she threw the baby in the river to drown the baby to get rid of it and they're having this discussion and while they're having this discussion an old possum comes in the yard don't forget the parable though they're talking about this this this young woman who threw her baby in the river and and they're talking about how the morals is gone and motherhoods are gone and here walks in a possum down the lane what a timely arrival brother ben said just then the milkman come up and he was looking at her he's talking about the possum all of us standing around and a possum and and a kangaroo is the only two animals that have a pocket that carry their young in so the old possum had let down her string that held the pocket together and nine little baby possums naked about that long was crawling on the ground i said look at that now come here leo gene i said there is a real mother's love there's a real really more mother about this old possum than there is about that woman that drowned her baby she doesn't have over 30 minutes long to live and she's willing to give that 30 minutes to fight for them babies it's a mother's love that's in her that makes her do that brother bam in other places he tells this story over and over but he says he takes a rake and he he lays it on her and he says many times you know when you go to touch them or get no they'll roll over and play dead amen but this wasn't just a possum by herself she had babies and when that rake touched her she started biting at it and started fighting but we know she was been attacked by something by what brother bam said she was so sick and so weak she was at the point of death and brother ben said couldn't have more than 30 minutes to live but she would give the last bit of her strength fighting to protect those babies that's light years ahead of that woman who didn't want to be bothered with a child and threw it in the river and he begins to talk about how how she came to the door because she was a mother she came to the prophet to be prayed for to be healed so that she could raise these babies because she was a mother she drug herself there because she was a mother she was expending her energy because she was a mother she was fighting for the lives of those little naked possums amen something that seemingly is worthless in this society and worthless in the world is demonstrating more love and more motherly love than most of the society in laodicea these days and brother branham is the one who's highlighting this it's not just a possum friends it's a parabolic man this is the kind of love even even an animal can have more love than a human ought to have and we weren't born just to have human love we were born to have the love of god which is so much higher than that lie but man has gone so low amen an animal has to demonstrate the right kind of motherly love because the women aren't doing it that's why we have abortions and birth controls and day cares and all this other stuff because a woman doesn't want to be a mother and doesn't have the right kind of love anymore but this possum was demonstrating it and such a phenomenal thing that it should come up and lay for two days at the prophet's door and brother bannon would eventually reveal to the prophet that she's come like a lady and waited her turn to be prayed for she was more of a lady than most women in the world today and so brother brahm uses this to begin to talk about a mother's love because a mother's love is so strong that even the mother's love in an animal would do something like this let's let's look at something in the bible from first kings let's turn the first kings together first kings chapter 3. the nominal christian world talks about love they have no idea what they're talking about it's all feeling and all emotion amen they they haven't even got to the place of animal love yet not even gone back to basic human love which the bible says they've lost natural affection so when they've lost natural affection they've lost just the basis of natural human love and now an animal is expressing more natural human love than a human they've lost natural affection and they believe they have the love of god and don't even have natural affection we're so far short in the world from where they ought to be first kings chapter 3 verse 16. and then came their two women this is coming to solomon this is a story to display the wisdom of solomon then there then came their two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him and the one woman said my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house now remember these are harlots so these aren't even legitimately born children i was deliberate of a child with her in the house and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also when we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we too in the house and this woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and i and laid her dead child in my bosom and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did i did bear and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spoke before the king then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the others say nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living and the king said bring me a sword. and they brought a sword before the king and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other then spake the woman who's the living child was and to the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said oh my lord give her the child and in no way slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it then the king answered and said give her the living child and in know i slay it she is the mother thereof this is this story is he put in here displaying the wisdom of solomon amen we know there's a spiritual application also in a natural application but you can see the natural love of a mother in that these two women were harlots so that these children weren't conceived under good conditions they weren't birthed in the right kind of condition these two women lived alone they were the only ones in the house they had children three days apart and when the one died one pulled a switcheroo but the mother who was the real mother of the living child amen her bowels yearned within her for the living child so that even if she had to lose her right to the child for the child to live she would give up all of her rights you see this is this is this is a mother's love this is natural a natural love of a mother but in one of the strongest loves there is on earth earthly love is this love between a mother and her baby and this woman she pleaded with the king no give her the child give it to her the other woman had no love for the baby because it wasn't hers and she said you can divide it that's fine with me do whatever you have to do but the real mother the one with real love says no i she was willing to sacrifice all her rights for the baby to live she was willing to give up she would she'd be heartbroken no doubt would she shed tears absolutely amen would she feel a loss the rest of her life yes but she was willing to suffer for that baby [Music] she was willing to give up for that child and now we're starting to see what a true love begins to look like because true love is sacrificial love amen and that's what this world is lacking and that's what true mothers can teach us amen i i've marveled watching and watching my wife with the babies and watch how much a human being can sacrifice they can give up their bodies they can give up their health they can give up their comforts they can give up their sleep they can give up so much amen because because the the needs of the child and there's something in a mother by nature amen she can just sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice and i am so thankful that god didn't have me carry children and care for them as infants because we would have worked out a plan we would have had a better schedule we would have because i don't know that i'd have been able to come to that level of personal sacrifice but watching it is amazing amen even a child waking up in the night two three four times at night or when a child gets sick no sleep at all you know one two nights and you know and so many times as a father you're willing to help and i'd be willing to help and my wife would wake up and i'd say no i'll go take care of them and as the children got older of course we took turns and we helped but when she knew that the only thing that would comfort that infant was me when she knew that the only thing that will bring calm and peace to that infant the only thing that will really come you can walk the floor with them you can pat their bottom as a father but there's nothing for that newborn baby like a mother and when she would know that she would say no i'm going give up sleep give up health give up everything just for the comfort of a baby i say that's that's a real love it is not even yet to god's love but it's real it's real it's genuine and it's a model for us brother ben tells another story of a young girl who's coming back from college he says some time ago a little girl went off to college and she come back bringing a little girl with her a little feist and when she got back she was getting off the train and her old mother was standing out there and the little girl that she had with her said who is that old miserable looking wretch and the girl was ashamed oh she said i don't know and when she got off the train the little mother run up said darling i'm so glad to see and said and she turned her back and the conductor was standing there he said mary i'm going to ask you a question i said how can you get so indifferent since you've been away to college is that what you learned in your intellectuals and then this is what the prophet said and i'm afraid that's what we've learned in all of our substituting intellectuals instead of love he's talking about the church instead of loving god we wanted to know something amen and have some information and be a stuffed shirt and know a little more than somebody else but missed the main thing which was the love of god he said we can do the same thing substituting intellectuals instead of love he said mary it is true said i'm an old man too i know your mother's ugly today the reason your mother is ugly is one day you were up in an upper room and she was hanging clothes in the backyard said while she was hanging clothes back there fire caught the house and somebody run and told her and you were in a little pinned off you were in a little room pinned off in the blazes everyone hollering stay out stay out but she wouldn't do it she jerked her apron from her and through the flame she went and she grabbed you and wrapped you in her clothing and she come through and she was burnt and scarred and that's what makes her ugly today and the reason you're pretty is because that she's ugly and she became ugly so you could become pretty and you mean to tell me that you'd be ashamed of your own mother brother goes and types that with us what christ has done for us he's taking the story as a parable to show how strong that mother's love is but how strong god's love is that he sacrificed for us he was marred he was disfigured his visage was so that it didn't even appear as a man amen he was so abused when he went to calvary amen he said how could you be ashamed of christ how could you be embarrassed of one that would love you like that and he uses this story of a mother because that mother was willing to sacrifice even her life for that baby she ran back into the blazes everybody trying to grab her everybody trying to stop her amen but there was no thought in her mind of not going after the baby her only thought was getting to the baby and getting it out no thought of her own self no thought of her own protection her own harm she wasn't probably even thinking of how to get in and how to get out she just reacted love was such a strong motivation that this woman could run into a fire amen and with all the potentials for harm and death she could run and save that baby amen what was it it was a sacrificial love amen and it wasn't a put on it wasn't a fake it wasn't a responsibility it was natural amen it just naturally happened that woman that was standing there in solomon's court that day she didn't have to contemplate and meditate there was a natural reaction for her to give up so that that baby could live this woman in the fire there was no you know she didn't have to sit down and ponder it over and weigh the responsibility weigh the consequence and say well you know i am the mother i probably should go it was natural that love could produce that kind of sacrifice that kind of action brother bam said she became ugly that you might become pretty she forfeited her beauty and and brother benoit tells the story in one place he tells the conductor says she was more beautiful far more beautiful than you are now but she gave up all that to preserve your beauty and christ was far more beautiful than we've ever been but whatever beauty we have it's because of his sacrifice [Music] she forfeited her beauty she forfeited everything that she had and she might save you and then you stand and be ashamed of that precious mother i say the same thing about the message about the word of god how could we ever be ashamed of this message how could we ever be ashamed of a prophet how could we be ever be ashamed of what he taught and what he said and what it sounds like how could we ever be ashamed because this message is christ he's the one who bled for us he's the one who died for us and this word amen is a bleeding bloody word to us amen so brother branham is he's tying these things together and he's beginning to show what what natural love will produce amen and when we talk about this kind of love there's no faking to this kind of love it's the reality you can claim to love somebody and really really love them and and really i'm just completely in love with this person i love them so much amen but let them wake you up 15 times in a night and then we'll find out you know have them in some way in danger and need where you really have to give of yourself to go help them amen where you really have to sacrifice something to save them to rescue them to help them out amen and then we'll find out whether we really love or not amen sometimes we haven't even come to the level of a mother's love let alone the love of god we haven't even come to a mother's love and so every mother in here is showing us something to showing us the strength of a bond of love and the amount of sacrifice that can be given from one human being for another because of a mother's love amen and it's one of the stronger the strongest you can get in human love and every mother in here is showing us that whatever this is there should be more from god to us and us to god his love for us is higher than this our love to him should be higher yet amen brother ma'am now we're going to go to another parable he begins to tell a story about his hunting buddy bert how many remember bert he called him snake eyes he said he had lizard-looking eyes he said bert was a good hunter but he was cruel cruel at heart just mean amen but he said you could depend on him he could hunt and then it's funny too that that brother benham should have a hunting buddy bert snake eyes who was cruel because we thought boy we we're not allowed to associate with anybody amen there's so many things we can learn through parables if we'll just listen he said i thought bert how can you do that that real loyal mother how can you do that what was bert doing he had showed brother ben earlier in the day he had made a little whistle that imitated a fawn's bleed it sounded like a fawn in distress and he said he showed brother branham and he showed him he could use that to get a doe to come out in the open and brother bam said oh you wouldn't you wouldn't do a thing like that bert and and now bert they stop they meet up and they stop for lunch and and brother branham brings these bert reach into his coat and he thinks he's going to get his thermos and a sandwich they're going to have hot chocolate and a sandwich but he pulls out this whistle and brother man said no bert you wouldn't do that and he begins to blow on this whistle and begins to imitate a baby deer in distress a fawn in need and this big doe at the end of the meadow she steps out steps out and exposes herself to the hunter and she's stepping forward to look for that fawn that's in trouble she's responding to the call of the fawn and she's putting herself right in harm's way she's coming right into the open she was hidden from sight but she stepped into sight to see if she could save this fawn and this is where brother is saying bert how can you do that that real loyal mother how could you do that listen we're talking about an animal again friends he was a dead shot how can you do it bert i thought oh god don't let him do it i turned my head i couldn't watch it being done that real mother was something that was genuine standing there standing there at her death because there was something inside of her that would even call her to her death yet she'd protect her young she was watching for that baby i turned my head i was listening to hear the gun go off and i watched to the splatter of meat and that deer's heart blowed plumbed through it when the big mushroom bullet would hit it and i waited and i didn't hear nothing and i waited a moment longer i had my back turned i thought what's the matter and when i turned the rifle barrel was going like this later he describes it as shaking he said he threw the gun on the ground turned around grabbed me by the legs he said billy i've had enough of it lead me to that christ who is love if the love of a mother could stand that way in death let me have the love of god when i come to my death he said see it's a display of real love mother of them tells this story over and over and over again amen and why so i mean he put so much emphasis on a deer and a possum and a and on all these things because it's a display of something genuine it was real why would his friend burst see burst saw something that wasn't pretending to be a christian and pretending to love god and pretending to love others he saw something that was absolutely genuine and could not be faked and could not be mimicked and when he saw the genuine he realized the lack that he had in his life and he said i want that kind of love in me and what he needed was a love that was higher than that love but this love was motivating him to a higher one let's look at some scriptures let's look at ephesians chapter 5. i want to read quite a few scriptures here for the next little bit so keep your bibles handy ephesians chapter 5 verse 1. he said in ephesians chapter 5 verse 1 says be therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet-smelling savor we're going to walk in this love as christ so what kind of love would she walk in the kind of love christ has that caused him to give himself for us so walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god even this scripture paul's showing us that love true love genuine love god's love is a sacrificial love and every true genuine love that reflects god's love is a sacrificial love it's not a selfish love it's not a self-centered love it's not a self-serving love it's not a love where the person itself is the greatest beneficiary but it's a love where the person is directed to is the greatest beneficiary that is this love that christ had for us and gave himself for us so true love genuine love is sacrificial love he says he goes on to say he said billy he's talking about burke now i've had enough of it lead me to that jesus that you talk about is so real what was it he saw something real he saw something that wasn't put on he saw something that was genuine he saw a mother's love that would stand in the face of death or regardless of what it was he saw something real not a sermon i priest or a song that the church sung listen we can have all kinds of sermons but if it doesn't project the love of god what's the good is it going to do we can sing all kinds of songs but if it's just a put on if it's just if it's just lipstick and mascara once you wash it off you'll find what it really is we can have a whole we can have such a ceremony to the surface that can be so beautiful and the songs can be so we love him and we have a sermon that's so nice but if there's no genuine love it won't work what one bird not a sermon that was preached not a song that was sung in the church but he saw a display of real love let's go to john 3 16. we we probably don't need to read it because we can quote it but i want to look at it in the bible and i only want to read just a portion of it this john 3 16 is plastered all over the place in christian graffiti which i don't comprehend sounds like an oxymoron to me so because i want the world to know god loves him i'll break the law which he told me to keep and defile somebody's property which i was told not to do it's amazing but anyways that's zeal without wisdom i think john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave that's all i want to read for god so loved the world that he gave that's it right there friends so god so loved the world that he gave what was the expression of god's love what he gave and the fact that he gave he didn't demand that the world give to him because he's god right god is an object of worship and and he could demand offerings and he could demand what other gods demand in other religions they demand more service and more offerings and and they demand more and more and more and when they talk about you know the gods being displeased they have to bring more offerings and greater offerings to satisfy the god who's never satisfied he always has a lust for more blood and more offerings and more gold and more this but we have a god amen who wasn't asking you to serve him we have a god who came to serve us he didn't ask you to give first he was the one who was willing to give and he gave most and he gave more for he came down and became flesh himself became a body because he could not ask us to pay the price we were not able to pay the price but because his justice required a price he himself would come become human flesh to suffer real pain amen real agony real rejection real suffering so that he could give amen himself for us so that we could be saved so that we could be redeemed this is love friends for god so loved the world he gave let's turn to first john go back near the back to first john first john chapter 3 verse 14. first john 3 14 we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hated his brother is a murderer and you know and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him he didn't say you that kill your brother is a murderer you that hate your brother is a murderer and no murderer has eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren this john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave he's asking you to have the same kind of love he had he's asking you to have the same kind of love a mother has for an infant child that you love the world so much that you're willing to give amen give up your reputation for a brother give up your comfort for a brother give up give until it hurts amen give till it's uncomfortable give give and until you're lacking and they're gaining amen because that's the way god gave to us he gave sacrificially he loved sacrificially and when it says we're to love the brethren as he loved us this is not this is not a phrase this is not a saying and this is not lip service but he wants a genuine love for one another because this is his family and love must be sacrificial love must be given now i want to come to another parable one other parable and before i do i just want to note that when i was a boy and even a young man when somebody would start to talk and preach on love it was like check out time for me like love oh my goodness i don't want to talk about love let's talk about slaying the dragon i mean let's talk about uh you know the great mighty battle so samson gideon give me something to go on but don't talk to me about love but that's because i had a worldly understanding of love it was all emotional it was all feel good and syrupy sweet and sticky and tacky and it was the wrong kind of love amen but when you realize that love is strong love is bold love is brave love is enduring amen love is steadfast and unchanging love is just firmer than a rock amen love is stronger than the strongest amen this is a different kind of love we're talking about it's the very mechanism that makes god all that he is it's the very mechanism it's the very reason of his strength expressed it's a very reason of his steadfastness and endurance amen it's the very reason of his giving is because of islam this is not a love that is characterless because somebody has stars in their eyes and and heart emojis twirling around their head and they've lost their mind because they see somebody pretty that's not this kind of love this is a love that's come to its right mind and makes a decision i will suffer for that brother i will give i will sacrifice i will give all to god it's a total it's a love that requires strength amen requires boldness requires amen endurance requires all the things that the character the divine nature requires amen so when we preach on love young guys don't check out amen this is real love then brother ben he begins to talk and begins to tell a story about the time his plane was grounded in memphis tennessee remember that story i mean you remember that parable and he talks about the the uh old-colored woman he called auntie leaning on the gate as he's walking down the road and and she says hello good morning parson he said how did you know as a person and she talks about she's been waiting on him praying and she begins he begins to have this conversation with this sister and he begins to talk to her and he goes into her house and he sees that she's got a boy who's sick at the point of death and and she said parson i raised that boy but when he got to be a man said a young man he got with some wrong company and he done wrong and said he got a bad disease a venereal disease and said he's in there dying he said two days he's been unconscious the dr man says there's no hope said we's good family here we never thought of anything like that he said he's dying and and said he's backslid and she said parson i just can't stand to know my baby's dying without knowing the lord jesus and i said what mother love she said i prayed for two days listen she didn't pray a quick prayer and go back to her business this is a woman that began to labor in prayer for her son i prayed two days i prayed for two days and said this morning about three o'clock i was dreaming and i dreamed i was talking to the lord and i said lord where is your elisha he said i seen a man coming with a gray suit on with a little bitty western hat that's the way i was dressed she seen brother branham in that dream and what was what was what was grounding a plane a mother's love a mother who would love this this boy loved him so much and he wasn't even a boy he was a man amen but she loved him so much amen no matter what wrong he had done she loved him so much he was praying for his salvation so earnestly that god would cause a plane and mean a storm to come to ground a plane and to hold it there and move his prophet amen by speaking to him and moving him away from the airport until he come across the sister um that that was a mother's love and god allowed a mother's love to move amen the environment to move storms to to reroute planes and do all kinds of things you think of how much money that airline lost putting everybody up in a hotel for the night and god didn't care how much money they lost here's a mother who's praying amen it goes to show god god's concern with one thing on this earth and that's his elect he'll move heaven and earth collapse kingdoms move economies for his elect that's who he's worried about brethren goes on to say i've walked into king's palaces i've been in some of the most lovely homes there is in the world but i never was any more felt any more welcome than i did in that little colored haunt that morning i walked in there knowing that the god of heaven was with her i didn't know what to do and he was going and he said it's dark it's dark and had the quilt in his hand like this and she pat him she said mammy's baby i thought yes in disgrace nearly 20 years old i suppose and no matter how disgraceful he was how much trouble he'd got into he's still mammy's baby that's a mother's love and if the love of a mother will do that what will the love of god do she patted him kissed him on the forehead listen you've always been a son of god if you ever were a son or daughter of god you've always been a son and daughter of god but many of us were living disgraceful lives amen but it never stopped god's love amen it never changed god's love we suffered for it maybe you're still suffering for the disgrace that you lived in the past amen but it never changed god's love for you he was never willing to not be your father because you were in a fallen condition he was always your father and always loved you through it all just like this mother her baby in total disgrace amen had shamed her had run out on what what she had taught him amen no doubt rejected her teaching rejected her instructions brought shame to her in a reproach to her but it didn't matter that was mommy's baby amen let's look at let's look at romans chapter 5. romans chapter 5 and verse 6. romans chapter 5 verse 6 for when we were without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for our righteous men will one die yet per adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but god commended his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners christ died for us when we were shameful when we were a mockery of even human life he loved us he never gave up on us he never quit he loved us brother branham preaches in the message the invasion of the united states and you know what the invasion of the united states was preached on mother's day praise be to god what a mother's day message he says here the other day i was talking to a mother on the telephone and the mother said oh brother billy she said my poor boy's in trouble said oh what what a trouble he's in i said yes i know about it sister dear and she said he may be wrong i don't know said one says this and one says that i don't know but so no matter whether he's wrong or right i love him but i said there you are i love him he said to his mother said this is the boy the young man he said to his mother i've been so deceived by this and that said mother i believe you're about the only sweetheart i really have a woman that's true to me and sticks to me that's mother's love that's a real mother that'll put her arm around her baby regardless whether he's right or wrong she goes right on to him if a mother can think that of her baby how much more will god think that of his it's amazing sometimes that we can see how much a mother will forgive and cover for and to the point where you're like would you please stop it they're rotten the whole world knows they're rotten but something about a mother she sees something under the rottenness amen she remembers that baby and she remembers the baby she held and the baby she caught on and a mother can't stop but believing that there's still something down in there there's still something that'll come out and the whole world can give up but mom's not going to give up amen that's why you mothers you can you can shake heaven like nobody else amen you can knock on heaven's door and remind god i'm still waiting on my baby amen i'm still waiting god i committed him to you and i'm still waiting because a mother is one person on earth who will not give up and god is the person in heaven who will not give up and those two loves can come together and move mountains amen don't doubt it amen believe it amen don't don't god gave you that love for a reason god put it in your heart god knit you together don't give up on them amen never give up on them keep knocking on heaven's door and saying god i just want to remind you you gave me this baby i committed it to you and i believe with all my heart you're going to save them and i'm standing by them until you finish your work praise be to god amen brother branham or i'm going to read in romans chapter 8 before i go to the next quote romans chapter 8 verse 35. romans chapter 8 verse 35 says who shall separate us from the love of christ romans 8 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword that is as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter and they in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor heights nor depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord you see why brother branham would point to a mother's love amen and begin to use that mother's love to show us god's love because god's love is so much greater than a mother's love amen but the mother's love is so enduring amen it is so steadfast it can continue on in the face of every obstacle a mother can still love i remember standing by my my my father's graveside and my dad passed away as a young man i believe he was coming to be 41 years old and we we come to the grave or not to the grave to the casket just before they closed the casket gave the family the final viewing and i stood there and we were all just saying goodbye and i was 18 years old and and it come time for my grandma they were going to close the casket and my grandma's just a little bitty old woman my dad was a big man and and she laid her head across his chest and began to pat his belly and she began to weep my baby my baby my baby to a mother that is always her baby no matter how old 41 years old no matter what happened in between no matter how many harsh words were spoken and how many misunderstandings and how many fallings out in repentances it didn't matter that was her baby and i remember she said it stuck with me she said he always used to love to have his belly rubbed like this going all the way back to when he see only a mother can hold on like that i shouldn't say that on earth only a mother could hold on like that but no matter how strong that love is god's is so much stronger so much more enduring so much more steadfast so much solid wrong it does not change it does not shift it does not move with time it does not move with emotions it does not move with our conduct god's love does not change amen you're his son you're always his son or daughter you always will be his son or daughter if god can love us like that how can we not how can we not give him everything brother brahm goes on to say he said she raised over and wiped the tears off her cheeks like that he's back talking about the woman with the with the boy who's so sick she kissed him on the cheek no matter if he was in disgrace she said mama's baby now see no matter what he was it's still her baby see that's it you think of a mother's love now but god said a mother might forget her baby but i can't forget you your name's engraved on the palms of my hands he loves you don't worry if you're taking his word just keep on let's go read this in isaiah where the scripture comes from isaiah 49. isaiah chapter 49 verse 15. in the book of isaiah is where brother branham refers to the scripture isaiah 49 and 15. can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee we've talked and brother benham's shown through the parables how strong a mother's love is the strongest that there is on earth but god says can a woman forget her nursing infant can she forget the child of her womb yay though she could forget and even god goes and refers to the strongest earthly love because he's trying to draw comparison even though it's possible she could forget it's impossible for me to forget you that they they may forget yet will i not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me god says you're permanently tied to me and i'm permanently attached to you brother man goes on to say in elijah in the meal offering he said that's a mother's a mother's love for her baby there's nothing like it only god's love a mother may forget her suckling babe but never can i forget you your names are engraved on the palms of my hand how can he forget you i'll never forsake thee i'll never leave thee i'll be with thee always even to the end of the world he goes on the message love to say mother may forget her suckling babe but never can i forget you your names are engraved on the palms of my hands sure by a roman spike how would his names engrave brother bam go through this many times they were engraved by the nail prints in his hands amen that's how much he loves you amen and those nail prints are the engraving of you engraved your names are engraved in his hands he'll never forget you because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world amen before you did right or wrong god knew there would be a sacrifice given for you he knew he would come himself and your your name is engraved in the nail prince in his hand let's look at jeremiah 31 just go over to the next book jeremiah chapter 31. jeremiah 31 and 3 the lord have appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have i drawn thee the new testament says no man can come to him and come to me jesus said unless the father draw him what causes the father to draw you because he loves you with an everlasting love i have i've loved you with an everlasting love and in loving kindness have i drawn you if the father has drawn you it's because he has an everlasting love for you and that everlasting love will never disappear will never vanish away well it doesn't matter how angry you make him his love will not change amen you say but i've been so rotten i've done so wrong i've made him so angry amen his love is above his anger amen brother ben says in the message perfect faith so that when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in the muck of the mud as i talked about this morning god came to us god sought you you never sought god no man can come to me except the father draws him first and god came down into that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create perfect love that ought to create a perfect love look what you was look what you are what did that somebody that loved you you say you know next time somebody says you're so blessed you're you're so lucky to have a wife that loves you like that you're so lucky to have a husband that'll care for you you're so lucky to have a family like that you're so lucky you're so lucky you're so lucky it's not luck it's the love of god amen he said look at what you want and look at what you are what did that somebody that loved you it wasn't you doing anything it was god's love drawing you and pulling you and nurturing you and feeding you and clothing you in his word and it's god's love it's nothing we did all we did was surrender to his love it was his everlasting love that drawed us there's no lucky we didn't get a lucky break we didn't have the right temperament in the wife and the right temperament in the husband i got lucky i married a good one you have no idea without the love of god that must might have been the most vile man or woman you would have ever met in your life it's not the temperament it's not their character and attitude that they were born with it is the love of god amen that has drawn them and birthed them into the kingdom of god it's god's love that's produced this it's god's love that has produced this life it's god's love that has produced these families it's god's love that has given us the word and set the church in order and told us who we are amen and if god can love us like that that ought to put a perfect love a complete a full love in us back to him not a childish love not a superficial love but an agape love amen not a feeling love where i feel good about loving god today and i don't feel good about loving god tomorrow amen there's got to be a love that expresses back to god it reciprocates to him then the same measure it came to us listen we don't live in the day of partial this is not partial this is not partial word this is full word this is not partial life this is full life this is not partial love express this is the measure of full love expressed this is not the partial stature of a perfect man we've come to the full stature of a perfect man that's what's called for in this hour the bright shining light of the word has been restored has come to bring us into full expression of the full word amen and there's got to be something that's deep inside of us amen that's a reciprocating love back to god and it's not based on self it's based on god amen amen in the message adoption brother branham preaches a four-part message on adoption in 1960 in the last part he says i said oh lord that's what i'm here at the church for trying to set the church in order when he preaches adoption he's trying to set the church in order telling you brother sister there's only one thing that can enter that that's perfect love he just got done telling him about his experience of going beyond the curtain of time he had gone beyond the curtain of time and had a translation experience where he could look back and see his body laying on the bed but yet he was in another place amen not far from where he was but another dimension altogether and people were running up to him saying my precious brother and he was shaking their hands and he said they were real they were just as real as you and i are here today you can say well i mean they're real in the spirit realm as if the spirit realm is fake this remember is the negative yes that's the pause remember this is the vapor the mist that's the reality and brother ben said they were real they meant this wasn't a vision this wasn't amen just a spiritual experience that was the reality of what's moving at a faster speed our eyes are blind to it but it's real and he goes beyond the current of time and they begin to say my precious brother and he has this experience there and he has to come back and he comes back to tell us about it and he never wanted to leave he said do i have to go back he said no words can describe it it's beyond any description and now he comes to the end of adoption and he's talking about that place and he says there's only one thing that can enter that and that's perfect love not because you're loyal to the branham tabernacle or the methodist church or baptist church them is all right you should be but old friends not because you spoke with tongues dance in the spirit because you cast out devils or moved mountains with faith that's all right for that's all right but still unless that real perfect love is there that was where perfect love was so he's talking about that dimension that's where perfect love was and that's the only thing that'll let you in there that's the only thing that can stay there it's the only thing there was there see that's the only thing there was there is love everything was love and everything operated by love even when we talk about the statue of a perfect man we break out the seven virtues that are in the in the divine nature those seven virtues are all love because they all come out of love and all of them together make up the capstone of love amen it's all an expression of god's love everything there was love nothing but perfect love can enter there nothing about perfect love can stay there nothing was there but perfect love so it behooves us amen to move into perfect love let's look at matthew 22. matthew 22 and 35. matthew 22 and 35 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him questioning ask them a question tempting him and saying master which is the greatest commandment in the law jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and the greatest commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets so what was the word of god love love so what's the greatest commandment of all thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind that's the greatest commandment what's this it is the second is like unto it the second commandment is very similar thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophet now what is he saying the entire word of god to that date when jesus was standing there there was no new testament all the word that you've received every commandment every order every parable every type every story everything you've got the all the law and all the prophets hang on these two commandments if you could get these two you've got everything and you don't need anything else everything the law was trying to teach them was how to love one another and how to love god every commandment every form of worship was trying to get them to love and express love to god and love one another amen but he said the whole law and all the prophets hang on these two commandments love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy mind with all thy soul that means with all of yourself complete abandonment to self 100 love god with everything and the second is like that love your neighbor as yourself i say we're still working on that but that's the goal that that that is love expressed then he goes back in adoption a little bit later he says thus saith the lord he says it's strong when you listen to the tape thus saith the lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there no matter how many how much religious demonstration how much good deed you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you're just so filled with the love of god so you can love those who hate you so you want to say do i have the love of god he gave you a really good quick test to find out whether you're full of the love of god because until you're just so filled with the love of god till you can love those who hate you amen sometimes god will send somebody along will hate you for no good reason amen so you can just see you know how much love you've got this is this is god and we're going to do a little test here today you know i'm going to send somebody along to express road rage somebody amen is going to just ball you out at work and somebody's going to absolutely just despise you and hate you and you can feel the hate coming off of them as they yell at you for something you didn't do as they accuse you of something whatever it is i mean you can feel the hate coming off you're like why did god let this happen to me so you can find out if you're in the love of god or not because until you can love those who hate you you've got some more growing to do that he says it's perfect love is the only thing that'll enter in there there's an interesting quote out of the ephesian church agent i really want us to think about this for a minute he says ephesus means the very name ephesus means let go relax backsliding slidden called by god the backslidden church god acknowledged first their works their labor their patience god rebuked their living leaving their first love for backsliding and for no longer bearing light ephesus was not a deceived church now i really want you to catch this right now ephesus had the original word do you believe that the apostle paul was a church age messenger they had the original word he says ephesus was not a deceived church that was not the problem and i can say by the grace of god by the message of the hour that this bride this message is not a deceived church so we can put ourselves in the same place because we've been taken back to the faith of the fathers so now ephesus was not a deceived church so i want you to hear what's said next because it's so important to realize we've received the word that removes deception so we're no longer a deceived people ephesus was not a deceived church it failed itself by not continuing in perfect love it didn't fail by deception it failed by not continuing perfect love and we've been given the message to pull back deception but we can still fail if we don't continue in perfect love now listen what he says next summary of ephesus he's going to start the summary fruits without love led to apostasy i'm going to read that again so it can soak in real deep fruits that means manifestations healings honesty family life fruits fruits of christianity fruits of clean living fruits of the word uh healings prophecies fruits fruits without love led to apostasy this wasn't a deceived church we're not a deceived people but that word has got to bring a divine love that word has got to bring us to a perfect love because that's the only thing that'll enter in there and we can even have fruits but fruits without love will once again lead to apostasy we see so much emphasis sometimes placed on fruits amen we fruits of this and fruits of that there should be fruits naturally there are fruits fruits come from the word of god when the word is planted amen it brings forth fruit but we can emphasize fruit and still hate our brother and still speak evil of another one or somebody who believes a little different and we call them a name and fruits without love led to apostasy i say god help these fruits be with love above all let's get to the capstone friends above all let's not hang up somewhere in the journey we've got to go to brotherly love and when we hit brotherly love it brings the capstone into place amen because if you love your brother you can love god amen if you love god you've not seen how can you hate your brother who you have seen amen we've we cannot have fruits without love that led to apostasy but we must have fruits with the love of god and we'll want that bring that'll bring a translation amen a resurrection a new body because the only thing that could move there amen is perfect love i say god help us not to repeat what the ephesians repeated but thank god there's a prophecy this bride won't fail she's predestinated not to this is the capstone age what does the capstone age mean in many ways we can mistake the capstone age to mean that this is the age that we get all the information and that's true the full word's been restored but brother banner said the capstone was love this is the age of perfect love moving beyond the trivial into the reality let's look together again at first corinthians 13. i want to read this with this understanding now in our minds first corinthians 13. first corinthians 13 chapter 1 though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love i'm become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol i want you to just we're going to catch this a little bit slower than we normally read it you can speak with tongues of men and of angels it's a heavenly language and i have not charity which is agape love i am become a sounding brass or a templing tinkling symbol i am now just a noisemaker undiscernable noise that doesn't produce anything and if we meet somebody who can speak with the tongue of men and angels we think there's something but if there's no love there fruits without love brought apostasy it goes on and says i am become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries listen friend if you meet somebody with the gift of prophecy and understands all mysteries i mean that's that's to me is a great person but if that is devoid of love it's going to bring apostasy though i give the gifts of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith listen to what paul's saying i understand all mysteries i have all knowledge and i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing listen if there was a pulpit ministry like this that had a prophecy knew all mysteries had all knowledge was full of faith that it could remove a mountain and cast it aside i'm telling you it would sweep the world into its arms but if it had not love it is nothing and the world would think it was everything the greatest ministry that's ever at the earth if that ministry with the greatest manifestations ever displayed on earth came without love it would bring apostasy it would be nothing and though i bestow all my goods now he's going to works he goes from gifts to works and though i would bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing that means you gave your whole self you gave all of your goods and gave your body to be burned what else do you have if you give away everything you own and give yourself to be burned you've given away everything naturally but if you do all of that which is the maximum level of personal sacrifice if you do all that and don't have agape love it profits you nothing fruits without love led to apostasy verse 4 charity now we're going to learn about charity what charity is what love is charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil listen this is absolutely contrary to our culture this description is the opposite of laodicea let's read it again suffer is long nobody suffers is kind i mean that's very on a much limited basis anybody working customer service the world has no love of god it's moving all into the believers envious not is not jealous wanteth not itself it does not talk and boast about itself is not puffed up does not have an inflated estimation of itself does not behave itself unseemly or inappropriate seeketh not her own i love that they begin to speak paul begins to speak of charity in the feminine now because the final expression of this love is going to be in the bride seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil i wonder why sometimes when you talk to believers they're always suspicious about every other believer oh you know i heard you know they say i love when they say you know they say it's like who says who's this mysterious day that you all we always get our information from you know they said about that church you know they said about that for you and you know they said well let's reveal that they pull the wizard of oz out from behind the curtain and let's talk to him and find out what they really know the mysterious day i'll give you his name it's the devil trying to sword disco to morning brother think of no evil don't you dare think evil when you hear it of another brother you think the best until that thing's been confirmed and when it's confirmed your heart will go to your brother not condemnation and not criticism that's what love does think of no evil rejoice is not an iniquity it's not happy when somebody falls it's not happening as some some other wrong but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things that means supports our covers for everything we'll just cover for everybody will support everybody beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things remember patience and the statute of a perfect man charity never faileth well praise god i've been looking all my life for something that will never fall will never fail everything i've ever experienced in my life has a failure somewhere but charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child all of this is about growing up to adoption but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity so many things we may have sought after in our christian life so many things we may have wanted to attain i want i want that level of spirituality i want that gift if i could only sing like that preach like that live like that do like that but the greatest of it all friends is charity if you can have the love of god reflecting back the love that god reflected to us if that love of god is in us and it's taking over our lives that's the greatest thing that we can have faith worketh by this love everything is based on love and the greatest of it all is love that's why brother branham says it's the capstone let's look real quick at second timothy because i want to look at the opposite now i love it when the word of god just begins to identify when you don't have to do a lot of preaching and point out a lot of examples because the bible does such a thorough job your mind just starts to connect the dots ii thessalonians chapter 3 verse 1. this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come are we in the last days so this is the last day's description i'm going to read for men shall be lovers of their own selves remember love seeketh not her own right it's always seeking the good of somebody else but the the contrary attitude and the end time for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters remember love doesn't vaughn itself and doesn't envy these two descriptions are polar opposite one is a perfect description of laodicea and the other is a perfect description of god himself covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection animals are loving more than humans are now truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness these are christians they have this group has a form of godliness having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away i said god make me whatever first corinthians 13 is make me that brother says in the message hear ye him and we'll wrap up with these few thoughts may god grant to you phoenix people here is my prayer that the loyalty of christ will be in your heart born in there by a nature of the holy spirit that will make you hunger for god and stand just as loyal for god and for his word as the loyalty of a motherhood stood in that stood in that old fawn that old doe that day for her farm brother branham is now i'm coming back to the story of the mother deer that stood out there at the distress call for her baby gave her life and was willing to be true amen and give out out of a love of an animal a mother's love expressed to give of her life to sacrifice for this fawn and now uh brother branham's going to try he's taking this story now and he's telling us that we should have the same kind of love for god that this mother expressed for that fawn now it's not about god's love for us brother brenham now is going to use the same parable to talk about the kind of love that we should have to god he goes on and says make me a christian make me a born make me born a christian like that deer what was that dear she was born a mother she was born to be a mother come be born to be a christian come on you'll have the same love of god more so than that deer had for her fawn that deer was not putting on that deer was born that way and by nature was that way and what the deer did the deer reacted in and by nature amen the mother running into a fire reacted by nature the the mother that was standing before solomon's throne reacted by nature this is not a put on amen we don't preach this kind of love so that you'll go home and make a list of things that you should do better and remember to say nice things about a brother and so that we'll dig in and say god i need more of you because this has to come by nature amen it's got to be a natural response it's got to be a natural outcome of the new birth amen there's not enough things happen too fast amen we don't have enough self-control amen to mimic this kind of life somewhere it's going to break down what we need is it for it to be birthed in us and grown into its full measure in romans 5 5 it says and the hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost shed abroad means poured out the the because the the love of god is poured out shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given to us how do i get this love by the holy ghost by the new birth amen birthing in me that nature growing me into the full stature amen of the life of jesus christ to display this kind of love on this earth and the message why some people can't keep the victory from 57 brother branham said now while you're thinking it over do you really want the real love of god in your heart and you haven't got it now be honest with god and as god's servant i bring you in jesus christ's name in the presence of almighty god and if there's one speck in you that's really sincere i pray god will bring it out this afternoon do you really know that you're short of that experience would you raise your hand to god and say god in christ's name give me that in my heart god bless you that's wonderful all just all over everywhere i want the christian love to display like that deer had the mother's love to display i want my christian love to be displayed in such a way that'll win others not my emotions but my christian love how we're going to win others when bert saw bert was a wicked man and he said he had a heart of stone he was cruel hearted i think is what he said when bert saw in an animal genuine love on an animal level it did something inside of him it began to break that old stony heart when he saw genuine love even on an animal level it began to break him down what if there's a people on the earth that can display genuine love but not on an animal level and not on a human level and not even on a mother's level but on the level that god loved us that can love one another with the same kind of love that can love enemies amen that can love their neighbor as themselves that can love god with their heart with all their mind with all their soul with all their strength with everything amen i believe it'll take an effect and break stony hearts amen what the world is they don't need rhetoric the world doesn't need rhetoric they don't need catch phrases amen they don't need programs they don't need fans they need reality amen what this world needs is a reality because nobody loves anybody anymore and when they come in contact with somebody amen sometimes i've had people say to me are you for real i said i think so i don't think i'm a hologram i mean i think that because some people just they don't understand that it doesn't make sense it's contrary to everything they see but i think that's what the bride is supposed to be at the end time she's supposed to be a display to this world of something different amen and if you ever talk about god making it easy for us you know how he says you know he can never display white unless it's against the backdrop of black and the contrast amen brings the display of white well god could have never allowed the canvas to get any blacker so that our lives we don't have to scream and shout we don't have to stand up and say i have the love of god in me you just live the way god calls you to live and react the way christ would react and live from the new birth and live the divine nature which the promise has made you a partaker of amen and people will know this is weird this is different this is odd they'll have all kinds of names for it they said man you're not even for real and once they realize you're for real they're going to realize there's nothing like this on the face of this earth that's what real love will produce real love in all of these stories parables that brother branham's using true love is expressed in hardship crisis and adversity amen i mean it's not loving your neighbor when your neighbor you know brought you over a plate of cookies for christmas and say oh god bless you i love you but the true love is expressed when when there's contention strife crisis difficulty when the the true love that was expressed and the mother dear was at a time of crisis the true love that was expressed by one of the harlots before king solomon's throne was it was a time of desperation amen the the the true love that was expressed by the mother who ran into the fire what is a time of great need amen the true love that was expressed and the mother who would pat her 20 year old son and say mama's baby no matter how disgraceful he had lived amen that was a time when he needed enduring love amen a steadfast love all of these loves and all of these parables were expressed in the face of adversity and need and distress amen and conflict and that's where the love of god is expressed and that's why our lives are not a cake walking and that's why bad things still happen and difficulties come because it's an opportunity to display to this world a life that they've never seen anywhere before when we listen to these tapes amen and you hear about somebody stealing brother branham's tent you hear about them rejecting him and the wives putting pressure on their husbands and not have brother branham invited anymore to the businessman fellowship when you know to hear the story where brother ban i'm standing at the door getting ready to come in amen to preach and they announced that he left because his brother was sick when you hear how they stole his magazine when you hear of all these stories when you listen to them you're not like brother branham you should have you say that was god in that man and it gives you more confidence than ever in what that man says you believe him because the life that was displayed when he would commit an error when he would make a mistake in sin he would go and make it right and publicly confess it amen and in the love that he had for god that he would make it right not cover it over but he loved god so much that he would make that thing right and then apologize to his wife and apologize to the lawyer and do all of those things you would look at that and say i have more confidence in him than i've ever had that's god in that man that's not a human being that's beyond human being i tell your friends that that wave chief wasn't waved when he picked up that vessel and showed us the word in maturity wasn't waves so we could say brother branham was a great man amen but we could understand that the love that was expressed in that human being can express and be expressed in this human being all it needs is somebody to love god the way that mother dear love that baby that will step out amen and stand for god that'll step out and take the criticism that will take the shot amen that will run into the fire amen that will give up their selves that will sacrifice their rights amen it's that kind of love that will display the love of god in this world a sacrificial love not just god's sacrifice he's already sacrificed now god amen he's done his part now it's our part to display the love of god not the love of chad who loves god but the love of god who's been birthed in chad and the love of god will love him back the same way the love of god love the god in me the god in me will love the god my father the same way not our love it's his love all he needs is somebody who will sacrifice somebody who will surrender somebody who will play the part amen of the mother with the with the baby the mother and the fire the mother dear and the face of danger amen the mother who will cover for the sins of her baby who was 20 years old god needs somebody to love him back that way and the question is who's going to do it i say god let it be me not in my strength i can't do it but i give you every i give you my heart i give you my soul i give you my mind i give you everything let that love flow through me amen i could move mountains with faith i could understand all mysteries i could have all knowledge i i could have prophecies and tongues and speak the tongues of angels but if i don't have love it all amounts to nothing brother benham said if i could have any gift of all the gifts if i could pick anything anything that you could want you could you could have i mean you could have the power of the spoken word 24 7. you could take any gift he said i would take love love over it all because they all operate by love they all operate in accordance to god's love god is love the capstone of our journey to adoption is his love we were birthed to express that love we're here as agents of his love not a wimpy weak love not a sissified feeling love but a real dedicated sincere reality of a love that only the redeemed the elect of this world is able to express amen let's read one scripture as we close musicians you can come colossians chapter 3. colossians chapter 3 verse 14. book of colossians chapter 3 and i want to read one verse verse 14. and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness everything and the message everything in the word everything is leading us to this conclusion to the love of god man let's all stand i want to thank you mothers for displaying a love to us that teaches us that we have to go a little further every mother that's cared for an infant every mother that's carried and given her body for a baby that sacrificed her sleep sacrificed her own health sacrificed everything and then there were times that i would come home from work and it looked like war had happened food i mean it was a bad day but that mother would do it all again the next day and i thank you mothers for especially ones who are living in the word for showing us what a true mother's love is and all it does is give us a springboard to say if this love can be expressed on this earth and it's human and it's motherly how much more with the love of god can we give of ourselves and sacrifice and suffer wrong and do all of these things i say thank you mothers for giving us an example but we're going to have to go beyond the mother's love to express this kind of love it's going to take the very love of god and if you walk away with any thought i want you to walk away with this thought registered deep into your heart fruits without love brought apostasy we can have all kinds of manifestations and demonstrations but if it doesn't contain the love of god it'll bring us into apostasy and we are not put on this earth to repeat the error of the first church age we've been put here for more than that we expect to see fruits we expect to see demonstrations but we should see it operating because of love by love and for love amen when i was a boy i thought love was wimpy and girly and now i'm realizing love is so tough so hard it requires everything love pulls a strength out of a woman that is surprising there's been stories of a mother lift a car off of her baby when a car overrolled her baby got trapped there's a story i read one time when i was a boy of a mother who fought a mountain lion that attacked her child she died in the struggle but saved her children you got to realize love is not this feeling thing that we've been talking about all our lives but love is hearty love is strong love is genuine love is real love is steadfast love is unmovable love is unbreakable love is undefeatable and i say god i want that kind of love in my life let's just bow our heads together and ask god lord jesus we thank you god we love you because you first loved us god without your perfect love everything becomes fruitless lord it becomes pointless if everything we experience and talk about and live for doesn't come to produce a capstone love in us it's worthless but oh god i pray that you would bring us to that place you envisioned us to be in before the foundation of the world it was your desire your plan your word and god we're here lord as your children to fulfill this portion of the word that you left for this day to be fulfilled god you've brought us to the capstone of perfect love god we're asking lord that you would move everything out of the way as we surrender to you and that you would take greater preeminence than ever before in us and let love prevail above it all lord god more than any gift i want divine love more than any treasure earthly treasure more than blessings that you could pour upon me in material goods god more than anything let me have this perfect love for that's the only thing that will enter in to that other dimension god i give myself to you i want to love you with all my heart with all my soul with all my mind with all my strength and lord i desire to love my neighbor as myself i want to fulfill all the word god i pray that you would take us as your people lord as you've demonstrated so well through the love of a mother and love of a mother dear and a mother possum and a poor mother in memphis and a mother run into a fire and all these things that we've seen and the stories that are surrounding us lord you've showed us what real genuine love is like the lord is calling us to a higher love god put that higher love inside me now in jesus name god i'm ashamed for the way i spoke in the past i'm ashamed for the criticism i've had towards brothers i'm ashamed lord of thinking evil and being selfish and self-centered i'm ashamed of those things lord forgive me for those things now god i want them all to die and fade away but i want your perfect love that can beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things i want that love i want a love that's not puffed up in vain and vaunteth not itself but suffereth lord and giveth lord i want that kind of perfect love from first corinthians 13 to manifesting me lord i give you my life afresh i lay down my life i want to step out in front of the gun barrel right now as that mother did for that fawn and lord i'm willing to die to have this kind of love i want you lord to live inside of me in a greater way than you ever have inside of this people lord lord i present them to you i just pray god that you would do a work in all of us lord that's far beyond our thinking far beyond our imagination but let the reality lord strike that the world will know that this is real it's not a put on it's not a religion it's not a church activity this is the reality lord let it live in us we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you let's sing brother ben think about his love [Music] think about his goodness [Music] that has brought us through [Music] four as high as
