happens and uh so I just appreciate all of you so much and love every one of you and it's this trip uh has been uh wonderful cuz I've just met so many wonderful saints of God I've been blessed constantly amen so I really appreciate that and uh so just thankful to brother Chad once again for the opportunity to be here and to share God's word with the bride of Christ and good to see every one of you good to meet every one of you just all the familiar faces and and uh we appreciate looking forward to some good Fellowship as well after the service is over amen so uh let's go to our Bibles and and uh so I want to speak on the seven sealed book amen and we're going to tie it into what we heard last night and so I'm not going to give you the no lightning and thunder is going to occur when I tell you what the theme is so it's not that great a mystery it's just going to link last night's service with this one so I don't want to I know it sound it a bit like a cliffhanger amen but let's go to Revelations 5 and verse 1 if by now you don't realize that the day we are living in is all about this there is nothing more exciting than to speak about this amen Revelations 5 and verse1 and we're going to go methodically through this chapter with a few verses and discuss this and enjoy it with all our heart amen Revelations 51 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne him singular sat on the throne singular a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals the Lord bless the reading of his word you may take your seat amen so in the revelation of Jesus Christ series The Prophet said that he wanted to spend seven nights breaking each seal in a series that was always his desire right and he said at that time if God permitted he wanted to set the stage for the opening of the seals and he did that from Revelations chter 5 amen and many theologians of denominations that have studied This Book of Revelation have gotten it all wrong amen all of them have got it wrong many come close to the truth but still just do not get it it's amazing how that our simple people have apprehended this amen and also the way um that it is spoken right in the message the prophet brought us the truth as God wanted it to be brought God to the bride and and yet he spoke it in such Simplicity you'd ask the question why would God choose this man to bring it such Simplicity and that Simplicity is what makes it hard for anyone else to put it together amen and even harder for the intellectual mind also the way the Book of Revelation is written and the way the prophet speaks of it are similar it's all over the place right it's got so the Book of Revelation matches the way the prophet speaks right why is this book so hard for people to understand is it because God gave John such complex Visions is it because John wrote it all jumbled up right uh jumbled mixed up I believe that it is written as simple as possible because John wrote it as he understood it and the fact that modern people cannot understand it proves that it is us that have a problem this is very important is it sealed to them with seals that God put on the book or is it seals of our own making the book is called The Book of Revelations not the book of hiding away yes sir which means it was always God's desire to reveal who will name a book The Book of Revelations when he wants to hide things away right it was meant to reveal it was meant to make known not to hide things so why has it become hidden because man has become so much into his own thinking and so far from Gods amen so this has caused Ripple effects through the church circles making sure that only a minority will receive the Revelation and there are many mistakes we can make if we don't find out what the problem is so we want to find uh with the specific book The Book of Revelation what is the problem why is it if we can just sift out at least a few reasons right so if we start from the top let's have a look at it the reasons we read in error is interpreting a book written in symbol form as literal so that's the first thing this is the first thing the prophet punches through this is a book of symbols Revelations book of symbols and whenever you take a book of symbols and try to apply it literally well you're going to miss everything it'll make a good Hollywood movie though you know lots of creatures and demons and things flying around and and bangs and Thunders and explosions and uh 200 million demons in the river Euphrates and wormwood can you imagine what these people can come up with if because they if they just take everything literally that's what they're going to come up with amen so if we only look at the symbols now for us okay enough mocking Hollywood but for us Brothers and Sisters of the bride of Christ if you're still taking things literally from The Book of Revelations you're just adding injury to yourself Amen in other words we must be able to translate the symbols into the manifestations now I know you're well taught I could just give you examples but that's going to take us too long so number two is thinking it's a book of Prophecy all of future events that's right I've heard some people who say there in the message saying that the entire Book of Revelations is in the future This Book of Revelations was written in the on the aisle of patmas by John at the beginning of the seven Church ages 2,000 years ago right how can it be a book of the future yeah there are many things in there that have already completed themselves it's finished there are some things happen in our recent past like the fifth and sixth trumpet World War I and World War II and then there are some things like World War 3 which is still on the verge of happening and there's other things that are in our future so we must be able to translate these symbols right and know it's not all for the future it's kind of like how people take the seven seal message preach 50 years ago and still claim that the third fold is way off in the future and because brother bam couldn't talk about it we can't talk about it it's exactly the same am right amen The Book of Revelations is known as the book of Apocalypse the word revelations in the Greek is apocalypse which means unveiling it doesn't mean cataclysmic event that ends the world apocalypse means unveiling amen right right is very often we say oh my goodness it's going to be an apocalypse what do you mean apocalypse means unveiling prophecy means foretelling events that are still going to happen or for the future but this book of Prophecy was written 2,000 years ago is it still a book of Prophecy today some of the things are there right some things have actually come to pass so many Christians put all those prophecies into the future but we the bride of Christ must be able to accurately perfectly discern where things are where they stand what is in the past what is happening right now and what is in the future one strange thing is that many message people tend to see the events as if they happen all at once quickly right so they're expecting at the coming of the Lord everything in the Book of Revelation just going to happen like this and over uh you but it did it's they don't consider that it took a long space of time listen Revelations 2 and 3 alone is a manifestation of 2,000 years just those two chapters and that's only one mystery of the prophecy the church ages the church ages themselves manifest over 2,000 years amen so here's the other problem thinking that The Book of Revelation is written in chronological order of events amen is this is many people thinking that well it's got to happen that way and then they take this quote of brother maram where he said the bride goes up in Revelations 3 and comes back in 19 and therefore everything that happens in between has got to do with the Jews nothing to do with us and they hold him to that statement forgetting he preached this whole message on Revelations 6 and Revelations 8 81 called The Seven Seals Amen to us and tells us it's the bride right yes sir so you hold him to one quote but you're not taking the whole message of the Revelation Seven Seals right it proves they don't understand and as long as they keep that thinking they never see Revelations 10 manifested that's right so if God opens your eyes you will see that some things are written in chronological order of events and others absolutely not now how can it be written in chronological order of events when the church ages alone are spoken of in chapters 2 and three but so many of the things the other Mysteries written in the other chapters are happening in the church ages right so if you just take that it's not written in chronological order of events it's written in order of understanding Amen in order of Revelation that means you could not understand the crisis of Revelations 5 why there must be a book taken you couldn't understand the seven Thunders you couldn't know the vials unless you first see the church ages so he wants us to understand the church ages first first see the distribution of oil seven golden candlesticks first understand the seven Messengers first understand the spirits that's going to happen within in the church ages that's right order of understanding then go to the throne then go to the seals then go to the 144,000 you wouldn't see that the 144,000 is Israel the elect of Israel if you didn't have the church ages first that's right this is why rord and ruford and the Jehovah's Witness and other peoples believe they're the 144,000 because they don't even recognize the church ages right so the book starts with John being in the spirit on the Lord's day when the vision broke you know we sing that song John was in the spirit on the Lord's day of course the Pentecost will say get in the spirit those words in the spirit on the Lord's Day means John was meditating on the second coming of the Lord the Lord's day is the second coming in other words think of all the things he he had heard Christ say and he their their thinking was remember the disciples question Lord what is the sign of the coming what is the sign of the end of the world you know what shall these what will these things be so he's locked up on the aisle of patmas and he's meditating on the things Christ spoke when is the coming of the Lord how is this going to happen how's this going to work out he's meditating on it he's that's what being in the spirit Spirit of Revelation he's in that is contemplating what what Christ had spoken what Peter had said what others were talking about when is this going to happen and because he was seeking it amen he was Desiring it he was meditating on it he was going back to the types and shadows in his mind he was looking at what the scriptures were saying and God brought the Revelation down get in the spirit on the Lord's day and you shall receive that's not have a Pentecostal uh time that's not the spirit amen that's right amen meditate on that seven seal meditate hate on the coming of the Lord and God shall reveal that is John in the pma's vision meditating and praying to receive understanding on things that the Lord Jesus had spoken concerning his coming and the end of the world and look at exactly what the Book of Revelation about God reveals the symbols of exactly the coming of the Lord and all the things that should come and lead to the end of all things amen that's exactly what God revealed look at that I mean Church ages Throne uh Revelation 6 the seals uh 144,000 the trumpets Revelations 10 the Thunders Revelations 11 the two witnesses uh and the Seven trumpet and Revelations 12 the The Mystery of the woman in travail and the and the dragon coming up to to take the the child the Manchild and uh Revelations 13 the two political spirits that would rule the Earth that would bring about the mark of the beast Revelations 14 The Reaping Revelations 15 those that stand upon the sea Victory Day uh Revelation 16 the vials and 17 the revelation of the the that sits upon the Beast and and and and then the destruction over in 18 and 19 speaking of the the bride making itself ready and the Armageddon and the revelation of he who sits in the White Horse Revelations 20 the Millennium and the Battle of Gog and MOG and the white tone judgment and 21 the holy city the New Jerusalem the symbols of who the bride is and 22 the closing of the book would think that just just meditating on the coming of the Lord would produce this entire chain this entire wonderful uh uh group of prophecies and understandings just given so the bride would understand nobody else would understand this oh if only Saints we could just meditate on that day of the Lord you shall receive glory to God the seven seal book is what we want to talk about amen so to begin the understanding of the seals we must first examine the book and its history did it ever strike you that the entire Bible we don't hear anything about a book in the hand of one who sits on the throne right you heard different things like in Ezekiel and and a scroll of book was brought to me by hand but you just don't there's no crisis from Genesis all the way through to Jude there's no crisis about a book we don't hear about these things suddenly in Revelations 5 there's a crisis right and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals so for us to understand this book we must go into the history of it you must know what it means right so I recently had a a young person on the trip that I that i' just been on a young man said to me so what actually is the open book and I thought well I'm definitely going to have to preach this amen what exactly is the open book because I hear you ministers and a lot of you speaking about it you constantly saying it thank God for the open book we are we are we appreciate the open book we keeps what exactly is the open book is it just the Bible being revealed is it just us understanding things in the Bible what exactly is this that's a fantastic question amen and it requires a proper answer amen so first of we have to understand one crucial point when you read in this scripture and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written what do you see open your eyes now right Open the Eyes of our understanding one crucial point there is one sitting on the throne and only one can can you see it one is a very beautiful number very mysterious number when my dad was teaching me message maths he said 1 + 1+ 1 is 1 and I thought wow I'm going to fail math in school 1+ 1+ 1 is one only one sits on the throne you agree you agree how about you yes sir right let's go to Revelations 4: 1-2 and after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven just follow on the screen we'll we can we can save time and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit amen and I be and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne Amen in Revelations 51 we see three things one sitting on the throne two he has a book in his right hand three the book is written within and on the backside it's sealed with Seven Seals so to begin with who is the one sitting on the throne is it Christ is it the father is it the Holy Ghost right it's not even showing you any identification it's just telling you there's a throne and one sits on the throne there's there's nothing there's no I mean come on this guy is he's seeing a symbol couldn't he have seen a more definite couldn't he have said there's an old man with a beard couldn't his symbol you know indicate he looks like the father he looks like the Ancient of Days I mean we're waiting so long for this right and God gives him a revelation no nothing he doesn't even tell us what form he doesn't mention a gender he doesn't do anything like that he doesn't mention any other thing that gives any other kind of clue it just says one sat on the throne right and in his hand was a book so who is it right to understand this you then have to go to Revelations 2 and 3 which is the seven Church ages that's right why in there lies the true revelation of the godhead at the end of Revelations 3 we see this let's have a look Revelations 3:21 so this is after the leian church age to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne amen oh this can look quite confusing if you don't read with Revelation firstly is he saying there are Two Thrones now because now this scripture is saying it's as if I Jesus Christ have my Throne amen and the father has his throne so I overcame and I sat down with him in his throne uh and so if you overcome you will sit with me in my Throne I'll let you sit in my Throne as I am overcome and sit down in my father's Throne if you read without Revelation it looks like there's two seats here one here and one there right so if there if you say there are two Thrones it's as if well Christ was sitting there at the right hand of God right because they misunderstand what Steven saw and then so he overcame and sat down in in the father's Throne so Christ is in the father's throne and then uh you overcome you sit down in his throne so now there's Christ in the bride and the father is on vacation you see how silly that that is there is and if this is Revelations 321 the end of chapter 3 and we just Revelations 4 if you were thinking there were two Thrones Revelations 4 tells you there's one throne and one sits on the throne there's no two seats right if there is one Throne you might say well Jesus sat down in his father's Throne Revelations 3 so in Revelations 5 it was Jesus in The Throne holding the seven seal book amen but hold on if Jesus was sitting in the throne holding the seven seal book because he just said in Revelations 3 that he overcame and sat down that means who is the Lamb that took it from Jesus who was already sitting on the throne with the book am oh now we're mixing the part therefore Revelations 5 is giving you the revelation of chapter 3: 21 when you read with Revelation you'll see that this is not again symbols not a physical literal happening in heaven of Jesus floating into the air going past the cloud and saying father I'm here to take the book now you you can have a vacation it's my turn now and then he comes in see I got to speak this way because I got to mock that thing that is exactly what the enemy wants from us to think like trinitarian and think like that in that way because it's preventing us from the truth and I'm going to tell the truth as it is amen not a physical literal happening where Jesus is coming another person in Trinity taking it from the Father the first one in the Trinity and then him sitting down if you see it that way you've got no right to criticize trinitarians that's right because either you are a trinitarian or a tunist or something amen yes the throne is a symbol that represents authority of the word am that's it amen amen the father's authority of the word ran through the church uh ran through the dispensation of the Father the invisible God who is above the people who could not be seen who could not be touched who work through the prophets and the Kings and the priesthood from Adam all the way up to Christ the dispensation of the father glory to God one with revelation will understand that the Throne of God described in four and five chapters 4 and 5 is a symbolic Vision that represents the authority of the word amen that represents the place where God dwells changing now from one manifestation to the next God expressed in an attribute called the father was the supreme authority of the word as long as he was invisible and above the people but Emmanuel ch against that not God above anymore but God With Us and Emmanuel was manifested in flesh became the Son of God that we could see that we could touch glory to God God expressed in the attribut of father was supreme authority of the word amen from the beginning of time until the word was made flesh and was crucified before that the rulership was in the name the relationship of Jehovah or Elohim but when the word was made flesh it changed Christ said no man cometh to the father but by me when he was crucified and resurrected listen the throne changed he said all judgment is given to the son what does that mean God himself and Moray changing himself one throne but now his manifestation is no longer father it is son amen amen that's what's happening still one Throne still one who sits in the throne amen just changing manifestation this is the great mystery the symbols of Revelations 5 is actually showing us so when it says sit with me is not sharing the throne oh now we getting there see let's tell the truth amen let's not try to be safe Jesus was not sharing the throne with the Father the father became the son that's what it is if the son took the book if he was taking them the father became the son glory to God God changing his form his throne moving glory to God what is this man becoming equal co-equal with God in in authority of the word in rulership of the world in rulership over all Dimensions do you believe that amen this was God becoming Christ and Christ becoming God there's more you know that's what brother m'am said God becoming man man becoming God there's more to that understanding for an entirely different teaching all right so what is the book now there's many pictures on the internet and uh all kinds of pictures I don't like pictures when it comes to the Book of Revelations so this is just a a a a pictorial uh expression of the symbol okay I don't believe there are literal books of paper in heaven God has no Forest to mash wood and make paper and a God who is omnipotent does not need books to remember stuff amen he does not need a secretary with files and files and libraries of cabinets and and articles and and files for him to remember like when he says and God remembered Noah it doesn't mean he forgot Noah it means he kept his Covenant when it says God remembered it means he kept his Covenant so this book all I want to show you is the symbol a scroll locked with Seven Seals okay nothing else I don't I I don't even want to say that there is a better drawing than this or I can make a better drawing I just want to show you a book sealed with Seven Seals what do we need to understand this book is locked up amen and it needs to be open right so how about this book then this book is written within in other words there's writing in inside the writing on the inside is not locked up it's the whole book is just sealed shut it's closed right and on this the back side of this book there are seven seals Seven Locks or seven preventions from opening the book yeah those Mysteries those seals are a mystery because we cannot identify what they are back then we didn't we were not able no man was able to identify what was locking up this book are you agree it's a symbol yes am what so what does the book symbolize what does it symbolize what what is inside the book what is this book symbolizing fine we're talking about this open book we know what the seals are we now know what the White Horse wrer but after all the seals are open and you've now got the book well what is it this book is so mysterious because nobody had ever seen or heard it about it since Genesis or that there was some kind of sudden urgency that all mankind would be lost if John or or somebody didn't take this book suddenly there's this this is like a trap like all of a sudden there's this crisis about this book and if no man takes the book All Is Lost that's right and we've never heard about this Moses never talked about it Joshua never talked about it Daniel had something there but we never heard Seven Seals in Daniel and we saw Ezekiel but there was no Seven Seals in there now suddenly like there's a trap here for us and we're in a bad place because if the Seven Seals are not broken and the book is not given all mankind is lost this is so unfair nobody told us about this let's go to is this the sign of the end sir notice Revelations 5:1 listen at this now and I saw in the right hand of him that sat uh that sat upon the throne a book written within the writing was with inside and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals I'm just showing you what the prophet says right there's writing on the inside of the book but the backside had seven seals on the book of it that wasn't written in the book now this is the revelat now I know you're possibly to preached on this I don't want to get into all of that I just want to point out the symbol there's writing in the inside uh and on the backside had seals Seven Seals on the back of it that wasn't written in the book now this is the Revelator talking John now remember it wasn't written in the book so everyone's got the symbol I don't like to do this but I'm doing it now imagine a scroll there's writing inside and there's these locks around it amen and you can't read the writing unless you break away the locks that's a very simple symbol right and he's saying here that the revelation of what the seals are are not written in the book that in itself needs some understanding so how can he say that when the symbols of the seals are written in Revelation 6 and Revelations 81 what so what does he mean by it's not written in the book right and yet it's written in the Bible yeah what he meant was the real real ity of those seals was a mystery that was holding the book bound those those spirits of those seals were going to manifest over the ages and were going to literally bind something over the ages of Christianity making it that the end time impossible for Christians to even know remotely what is God that's how bad it is amen he meant the reality of those seals became IM Myster and they wouldn't know it because the reality of what the white horse rider was was not written in the book yeah right the reality of the what the red horse rider turned out to be Church joining State not written in the book right black horse rider payos not written in but the symbols were right so we need to know the actual thing that's binding the book what is it firstly what is the book what's binding the book amen I know some of you thinking how does this apply to what what we heard last night we're going to get there am so next question I want to go through this slowly listen I know all the quotes we're going to read you've read be everything you've read before I know you know it every single message believer on Earth has read these things right is I'm not giving you anything you haven't heard of or you haven't seen what I'm just doing is putting it in a little bit of an order so we follow a thought amen right and hopefully by the end we can enjoy some fellowship together you love him Saints am okay is the book The Bible right let's answer that question and by that uh brother M says in earnestly contending for the faith this is preached 1953 we can lay down the lids of his Bible we can open up the lid the Bible Lids but we cannot open up the Bible that's right there's only one can do that that's right that's Christ the Bible is in the hand of God Amen the Bible is in the hand of God is there some special Bible in heaven English Bible see let's put all that out of our head the Bible is in the hand of God on the throne and there was no man in Heavens nor man in earth or man beneath the Earth worthy to take the Bible am to open it or to loose the Seven Seals that was sealed on the backside of it and John began to weep and one of the elders said weep not for the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world was worthy and able to come and take the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and to open it and loose the seals thereof and that's the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world and the Lord Jesus Christ now here it is may he come this afternoon and open our standing may he take the things that's written in this book and give them out to the people just as they have need of it so though I have the Bible in my hand the understanding of something about it yeah even if you say the understanding you and I can read this Bible we can read the words and yet not understand we can understand it in our own way we can understand it in someone else's way yeah yes but the understanding that is required that's what we want so is it really the Bible I mean the English Bible is that really it English is not even a Heavenly tongue yeah or a seven-dimensional form of communication I don't know neither is Hebrew and a Heavenly it's an Earthly tongue it's an Earthly language there isn't a single uh Earthly language that that that should be a Heavenly dimensional language CU they were all created here on Earth right furthermore this Bible this English Bible or this Bible that was in the hands of God apparently no man was worthy to even look on it that's right men have been looking on on this thing for a long time it's in Gideon Bible on every filthy Hotel yeah and mtel all over the world and men are looking on it touching it oh my goodness terrible things done with it yeah it's definitely not that yeah amen no man was worthy to look upon it to open it furthermore the prophet says that this book was in the hands of Adam before English came about before French or Hebrew or anything this book was in the hands of Adam and he lost it he sold out his inheritance to Satan and the book went back to the hands of the original owner right if the book was in the hands of Adam it means it's definitely not the book that you bring to church every day absolutely not the Book of Revelations 5 is the secret of all secrets yes it's far greater than secret number 11 which is the ingredients of KFC it's the secret of all secrets amen the symbol of the mystery of God Amen that's right that's what the book is who God is that's right what it means to be God it is the symbol for the intimate knowledge of the person of God Amen it is a symbol of the revelation of the mind of God am what is revelation 5 telling us if man does not take the revelation of the mystery of God All Is Lost amen if man does not take the intimate knowledge of the person of God All Is Lost amen if man does not receive the revelation of the mind of God All Is Lost the Bible is the written word expression of that symbol what it is amen is one thing and it means everything to us amen all right what is it then if you have this book of Revelations 5 you have the power to rule the Earth you have you receive back everything Adam lost once that book is delivered to you once you whoever holds the book rules amen we know that God wrote three Bibles the prophet tells us the stars in the universe the pyramids in measurements and The Holy Bible which is written in the many different actual languages of men on Earth in other words God expressed the revelation of God of being God in all kinds of manifestations that's right the Stars the pyramids the English Bible the written Bibles you agree right so the the books of the Bible were written in Chalan in Hebrew in Aramaic in coin Greek so the English Bible as we know it is just actually the last expression of the actual thing the English Bible is actually the lowest expression amen and there are many things to it but simply it symbolizes the revelation of who God is in the present day what is the Book of Revelations 5 it is the mystery of being God Amen a reation Jes what is the mystery of God remember Revelations 10 the mystery of God should be finished what does that mean the greatest questions that man has today number one ask any people in the world even the atheist they arguing they are atheists because someone you you can't get an atheist unless there was someone who believed in God yeah that only occurs because the belief in God came first atheist didn't come first so does God exist that question does God exist and the second question who is God if he does exist that's a question in every man's mind right is knowing God's name knowing the mystery of God that's what the Jehovah's Witness say that's what the Jewish people believe knowing God's name Yahweh I am uh the tetragramaton the uh what other every other name they they've got people fighting about Jehovah and Lord and uh uh Elohim and and uh um what are they they call him all sorts of different Hebrew names and now you find Christian churches things kind of fizzled out for them and even Jesus got boring so now the songs are all Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh right have you seen that happen and all different kinds of of names of God it's like they feel like if they know this name well then they get to know God once again fooling themselves knowing God's name God doesn't need a name like alisto or Chad what does that even mean every name of God was defining a relationship of God to man it's not a name you how can you even limit God to a name a name sort of defines some finite thing even the attribute father had a time limit on it because a father is producing sons and and giving purpose right and then son had a time limit on it because there was still the Holy Ghost to come and then son comes and then there's still bride amen and they're all relationships to god Jehovah meaning God dwelling with his people Jehovah Gyra uh the Lord will provide Jehovah Rafa the Lord who heals amen El Roy elai uh so many of the different names that are there in the Old Testament the strong and mighty tower The Refuge The Shield the buckler they're all relationships to man a name is simply God's relationship you can know those names in the letter or even try to understand it and you still don't know God amen amen if if we even have to have a a discussion about what God means do you know what's all the big problem when you get people fighting against the revelation of the open book yes sir they literally don't know what it means to be God they have a problem with that think of it if you have a problem with what it means to be God you will resist the open book because we have an idea everyone thinks God is an idol meaning we must bow down to him we must worship him we must say good things about him because if we do then he'll bless us oh my goodness what an immature understanding of God Amen you do we really believe that when we say God loves the Praises of his people is he sitting there and say yeah give me more come on you can do better more words amen more lovely English words better vocabulary come on I love it do we really think he's this like this Earthly Kings who like write some pages about me write more books extol my name bow down worship is that our vision of God and when when we speak about what it means to be God they will say blasphemy you are making yourself Above This you are making yourself God that's a problem CU they don't understand what God means so do that mean when Adam lost the book and he lost the right to the mystery of God does it mean Adam forgot what name God had what does it mean then he he if if the book is about the mystery of God and Adam forfeit it what did he forfeit the knowledge of who God was like oh he had sudden Amnesia he forgot who his father was he didn't know who created him man just suddenly lost everything every knowledge of God suddenly do you hear see this is why I'm saying we got to preach this way the only way to challenge your thoughts and put the reality in is to mock the previous belief is to show you how ridiculous and silly it was yes amen absolutely not Adam did not forget the name of God and suddenly uh Yahweh became a mystery that could not be pronounced or could not be spoken or hidden and there's some anagram and there's some kind of cryptic and stone and tablets and oh my goodness that's some Egyptian adventure program or something that's not what God is there's no more to it than that people believe that man who has the true answer to all these questions that any man who has the answer to these questions who is God what is God what is his name people think if we can just know those things well we have the answer to life you know the Lord Jesus said even if I tell you you won't believe me so if let's say there was some denomination uh who came out with this revelation of what God's secret name is what good is it going to do for them what what are you going to do with it how is it going to help you right and but they believe it Pentecostals believe oh when that new name is revealed they've got no idea what that is that's the secret name and and the Mysteries spoken of some people in the message to hear what brother baram says and they think man that name one day is going to flash in the skies and the clouds and lightning is going to open it up and when we see and then reveal that new name there's just going to be power the answer to that question of the mystery of God is not given to the mind it's not even conceived in the mind it is believed in the soul the soul was corrupted by unbelief once therefore it lost the answer to the mystery of God holding the mystery bound are Seven Seals that means the soul of man is never going to conceive that mystery of God again unless those seven seals are broken that's why all was lost if the seals were not or the book was not taken and the seals not loosed are you with me so now we can understand why there was a crisis in Revelations 5 why at the end because here coming to the end time man had gotten so far from God they literally used the revelation of Jesus Christ to trap people yeah to enslave people amen amen it's not a literal book it is the symbol of the all powerful Almighty revelation of Revelation the mystery of God God's Great Plan of Redemption for man and if we don't see it there is no hope for mankind amen that's the crisis listen let's make it this understanding a little bit more before we get to the secret of it if you don't take the book there are no souls saved at the white Throne judgment right that's right amen true we are not just here to have a good time in the presence of the Lord there are going to be Souls who are going to be granted Mercy at the white Throne judgment because you took the book we have a bigger responsibility than just having a church singing some songs and listening to sermons there's a actual judgment coming where people's souls are going to be granted Mercy because the bride of Christ prevailed amen am sin took away what being God means and made it the greatest mystery in the world when I look out there it's so sad yes when I walk in I just choke up sometimes walking through airports and watching all these Souls Pass Me By I get this feeling in the back of my spine like Lord what am I doing here what is going on look at this they're so unconscious of you and and I'm walking through this place and my mind is constantly conscious of you I'm thanking you for having arrived I'm thanking you for where I'm going I'm speaking with you in my mind where where and yet there's just people worried about what Bagel to have next you know or which flight and or what they're going to do when they get there there's just no uh uh uh conscience of God in man's mind anymore he's so far gone let's go to um paragraph 294 the word comes the book that is written within is then completed when this all these Mysteries have finished to be sounded now let me read it again so you'll be sure now uh in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the last Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished you agree finished the mystery of God should be finished when the Lost Angel is sounded amen which means everything that needed to be manifested has been manifested amen now it's ready to be revealed because immediately after that someone says go take the book yeah amen it's complete whatever was supposed to be manifested in time of the mystery of God is complete in the days of the seventh messenger amen and then the command of voice from Heaven says go take the book amen never before amen so the mystery of God is complete 295 now what is the mystery of God one of them Paul said in 1 Timothy 3 I believe it was said without great or controversy or controversy whichever way you pronounce it here great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh we handled him now we love this because oh that was Jesus Christ God right received up in glory witnessed By Angels Vindicated here on Earth God was sure it's a great mystery but it's all solved not father son Holy Ghost three Gods but one God in three offices now he's explaining the fatherhood under Moses the sunship under Christ the Holy Ghost under the dis this dispensation three dispensations of the same God not three Gods three different officers three so you understand why it says the mystery of God is finished amen because the the manifestations that should reveal God in a relationship of father son Holy Spirit has been complete am it's done its work all the Mysteries that had to reveal father was done all the Mysteries that had to reveal son in time was done all the Mysteries That was supposed to reveal Holy Ghost was done the mystery is finished now amen you love him Saints amen the mystery was finished in manifestation but yet man did not possess the Revelation the mystery of God had nothing to do with the name uh any singular written name of God or what his name is it had to do with his relationship to man that's it that's the mystery right what is Father what is Father what does Father mean to us right the dispensation of the father had two ages the age of conscience and the age of law the father was invisible he was above them he could not be touched he could not be seen you would die he gave them law in the beginning they they served him by conscience having no church no opening prayer no closing in prayer no Bible no scripture No audios no Gatherings no Traditions just conscience for 2,000 years and then the law came in because of transgression and it came with Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not this he started dealing with them as teenagers right right they're immature man is immature because man lost the right amen he lost the book yeah and so he the father dispensation is God dealing with children amen but when the son he came to bring forth many Brethren like unto himself it was Fellowship it was Brethren it was Emmanuel it was God with us and then the son came for a season and left and the Holy Ghost comes in which is God upon us God anointing us God giving us gifts and abilities like the son I pray the father he will send the Holy Ghost In My Name What's that the spirit of God will send you an anointing that will give you the gifts of the son of man when you break that down that's what it actually means right so the mystery of God and always has been here it is are you ready for it the mystery of God is and always has been about man from the beginning it's been about man why use the symbol of a book so because we understand books books happen in our realm of life because a book contains words and words give meaning words can be read words can be understood words can be believed that's why the symbol of a book is used so God because God reveals himself by his word he's using the symbol of a book why is this book then sealed amen let's read are you still with us amen verse 2 to 4 of Revelations 5 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man yes amen no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there this book is required by man to be open come on God can open anything if it's the father why could he open it if it's the spirit the great Eternal being the self-existing one what's the deal with man and this book because it's always been about man and no man in heaven and verse four and I wept much again because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon so as long as this book remains sealed no man would know God no man would understand God no man would perceive what God is no man would would have any result resemblance or understanding of what it means and would believe in other words if the book is not in the hands of man we are always guessing we're always presuming we're always getting it wrong every religion is so far from the truth it's as if North Pole and South Pole yeah right now today Christianity is as far away from the understanding of God as North is from South it was an emergency that the book comes back into the hands of man or else everything on Earth was lost all right so it seems that this book is meant for man you agree you love him Saints you enjoy his word amen paragraph 25 the fourth seal and then no one in Heaven Nor in Earth or beneath the Earth was was worthy to open it or even to look upon it you know that means if it's saying that no one in heaven that's sixth Dimension no man sixth Dimension no man under the Earth beneath the Earth That's The Fifth Dimension no one in the sixth no one in the fifth no one under the sea wherever they died no man living no man dead in other words it was searched amen and John wept because he could find no man he could find no man because if that book was not taken out of the hand of the original owner where it had been lost by Adam and Eve so he's not telling us where it was lost in other words this book was once with man the mystery of God was once with man amen they forfeited their rights of the word the promises their inheritance remember they controlled the Earth they controlled the Earth he was an amateure God for he was Son of God and Son of God is an amateur God and the people in the message stumble at the flower in the rug amen that's a quote by the way brother Ram says they stumble at on the flower in the rug he was this amateur God this is the the thing they used to make an excuse we're amateur Gods we're not God we're amateur Gods see how quiet you went that ain't contrary to the scripture he's saying amateur God is Not contrary to the scripture why does this this Prophet have to explain this because people are going to Mis interpret him saying amateur God even Christ came and did exactly the same thing they understood listen if we know Christ came speaking and at every time he was speaking uh he said don't tell them don't say son of God don't say son of David don't say this sh don't tell them that and with all the don't tell them they still come and say you being a man make yourself God which means they were understanding what he was not saying yeah right amen they were not confused about it with all the terminology he was using and not using they understood he being a man is making himself God and this is a problem for us and then he makes a a a man's argument why but doesn't the word say Gods as if that proves anything he was just fooling with them right he was never going to tell them anything amen amen if you call them who this is what Jesus said if you call them who the word of God come to what does the word of God come to profit if you call them who the word of God come to Gods how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God right there it is are you still with me on the journey all right so here it is we're going to tell the truth right amen sir the book made Adam God Amen on Earth that's it yeah Adam was God on Earth no no no he wasn't a God on Earth he wasn't an amateur God on Earth he was God on Earth amen man was the last unfolding of the great self-existing one he was the last manifestation go read Cod volume one question one on Genesis 1 amen he starts with this great self-existing one the Fountain of Life and the logos coming out and he speaks about all the plan that happens and literally tells you unfolded into man that's right man was the last man estation of himself and the book was in his hand when Eve stopped to reason Adam chose to walk out with her he chose to give up the book the position amen right is it really a crisis why do we need that book now watch what's happening let's wake up and smell the coffee like like say right let's see what's happening do you see what's happening around us yes sir in this world Amen everybody on Earth is living their own life in peace nobody is interested in any book we have worked out a good system you buy your food you don't even have to plant your food anymore you don't some of you don't even have to kill maybe some of you only kill cuz you like the sport and you like the meat but you really don't have to you can just go to the store and buy packaged beef and mints and chicken and shrimp and whatever you want you don't even know where shrimp lives oh what it eats it's delicious but they are the pigs of the ocean yeah they feed on the excrement of all other creatures yes sir oh that is delicious they are the Scavengers the lobster and the shrimp and all but you don't even care you don't even have to because it's literally provided for you everything you need is brought it's in arms length it's in reach you can buy clothes you don't even have to stitch them anymore or cut the cloth you can just go to the store and buy it man without the book has created his own book right we have governments that protect well they're supposed to protect our borders they're supposed to make global trade uh profitable to us not the elites they're supposed to protect us they're not supposed to teach us morality that wasn't their job but they're doing that as well right governments are literally telling us what is moral and what is immoral and listen politics is immoral you hear that it is immoral if you vote for a government and giving it the right to kill someone yes sir you voted for that person to be killed that's the truth about politics politics is as far away from God as it should should be amen our government should not be teaching us the way it was under your founding fathers was the government takes care of the borders providing military protecting the nation uh providing U maybe even health care or something but uh global trade so it can sustain the nation but leave the morality to the church we'll teach them about marriage about gender about abortion but that leave that to us we'll handle that but now they're the preachers they're controlling the morality imagine some of the greatest things on the ballot in a few weeks time is morality look at these people talking about decency and a candidate who's more decent than another what is that there's no decent politician there's no decent politics it's all a ruse it's all a lie right why am I telling you this because the system has been created so man doesn't need a book man doesn't need the book everybody on Earth is living in peace and they don't need God they don't need the mystery of God we are all depending on the systems in fact nobody in this world cares about the knowledge of God anymore they literally brought out all the intellects Richard Dawkin Sam Harris uh Christopher Hitchens and they turned their Western Society Godless amen and those who are living are regretting it right because now you have these people rioting and protesting for stuff they don't even know about right and they're they're wishing they never turned a society Godless no one sees the importance of believing in God for survival for anything for wisdom no we we just don't need it you're going to you know life has become so soft if you really think about it it looks like we're we're bluffing ourselves we're just that this is why they say we're a cult we're a religion we're we're a philosophy if you ask your children today in reality there's no life expectancy argument for them your children are under the illusion that they're going to live a very long prosperous healthy life there's no death at their doorsteps there's no uh Twigs poking them in the nest this life is so comfortable we work we buy cars we buy homes we buy our clothes what is it really pushing us that I really need to go in the Rapture I really need to get out of this life that kind of only happens when you get some debilitating disease or something then you start getting desperate other than that that all is well we are blessed right which means that system is working on you and you actually have no desire for the mystery of God and all religions are bluffing themselves about worshiping God and waiting for him to Cal and and save us from what from this beautiful life amen of paychecks and good clothes and air conditioning and good cars and vacations please take us in the Rapture away from this horrible life we're enjoying your children are not confused about this it takes something of the Bride to desire the mystery of God that believes that that we need something that transcends this life of comfort but you must know that this world has created another book the bigger question more important question for us sitting here is knowing that Christ died to take away our sins enough to make you sons of God or is there more because that's what the Pentecostals and denominations are saying that's where they've stopped that he came came he died on the cross and he shed his blood for our sins and he took our sins away and then we wait for him to do the rest that's the idea is that enough because that's stopping with a manifestation a part of the manifestation of the mystery of God 2,000 years ago and more of the mystery of God was manifested through the church ages bringing it right to this end time and there's stopped there and and when we got the message we said oh look at these poor people stop there and then we got the message people and they stopped with William brandom right and they want us to stay stuck there let's go to the six seal message prise God paragraph 127 that's the reason John wept because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone she just simply turned back to atoms molecules and so forth cos light not even be creation person nothing else cuz Adam lost the rights of that book he forfeit it when he listened to his wife and don't get distracted with that right she listened to Satan's reasonings in the stad of the word see it was forfeited then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way the mystery of God could not go into the dirty hands of Satan right Satan was unable to it was not even meant for him the mystery of God was meant for man it went back to its original owner like any abstract deed would do goes right back to its original owner that was God the Creator who made it he holds it so Saints if man doesn't take that book again the Earth will come to an end as we see it clearly coming we're so on the brink of World War I an absolute annihilation right the signs are all over the planet religions have been expecting the end of the world for a long time uh I was speaking to um um a doctor I can't remember what his his station was what his specialty was but he he was telling me that uh I asked him what what does he think about the world and he said well there are several categories by which the world will come to an end and most scientists actually believe that it will that the world the the planet itself won't even go to a place where it will it will survive and U that life on Earth will will be completely destroyed somehow and they said like on the bottom of the list is like a a virus that just kills all humankind or another asteroid that smashes the Earth and destroys life on the planet fills the atmosphere with horrible gases but he said to me all scientists know that it is more likely for man to destroy destroy himself by nuclear war than for an asteroid and a virus or any other reason they believe that that's right amen religions have been expecting it this is why John was crying he saw the end of mankind he saw man Godless sinful annihilated more so he was crying because no man that ever existed was Worthy not even job or Enoch yeah what made us wor unworthy was our sexual birth that's right amen what makes us unworthy the way we were brought into existence why you get such good people I mean Mother Teresa people would say you know Mahatma Gandhi you know Nelson Mandela you know I'm sure they spouses had good lot to say but you know they think humanitarian soft Souls that love people self-sacrificing you can go through names and you know honest able whoever you want to you're never going to come up with someone who is worthy because as long as we conceived by sexual desire we're doomed right and that's where it ties into last night yeah that's right because someone else decided to overrule us within ourselves amen amen one of the elders Revelations 5:5 saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David had prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof one of the elders shows us that we could that we should see the somewhere somewh where in the Old Testament he moves our Focus one of the elders symbolically Taps him on the shoulder and says the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed this this uh Prophet uh Apostle John is something's Rising inside of him and is telling him there's a revelation emanating from the Old Testament someone was worthy who can it be and uh lion means leader king of Judah Lion of the tribe of Judah hence the name son of David and Messiah that's who he is he has he has saved us he is worthy he has prevailed he overcame he fulfilled his purpose because he wasn't just a man he was God becoming a man and John who had doubts about Christ the way they understood him the Messiah to be a mighty prophet and Christ came and he died on the cross they he let them whip him he let them pluck out his beard he let them spit on his face he let the man handle him how could this be he that's right no man was worthy so was Jesus a man or not why was he worthy he was not conceived of sexual desire which means he had no son of the Bond woman right amen he had no Bond woman amen amen he was perfect in all things he could have taken the book for himself and rule the Earth but any single person conceived of sexual desire if you give him the book he'll never take it for anyone but himself that's why it had to take a lamb that's why it take one who was not born of sexual desire one conceived of the Holy Ghost who would come what is a lamb really about one who will take the book for others amen and not for himself one was willing to do that that glory to God that's what made him lamb he was the perfect sacrifice he's not asking you for the book now right he's not being offer of the book The qu the statement is take the book let's read it and I beheld in low in the midst of the throne out of the four beasts and in the midst of the eldest stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne oh let's break into that Lord there's this great person sitting in the throne are you still with us amen and there's four Liv creatures and there's 24 elders and there's a rainbow and there's a glass sea of glass and there's seven uh lamps of fire burning Before the Throne and this lamb just walks up and takes the book just strolls up and takes the book from the right hand of him that sat on the throne I mean you should expect like lightning to zap this lamb right if it had to be that way what does he think he just walks up it doesn't say he goes father please give me the book oh no the symbol say he takes the book amen come on break into it Saints understand this this is why it's not some fictitious Greek story about a son taking it from the father or asking or the father handing with loving eyes here you go my son take it he goes up and takes the book this tells us it's not about those stories it's God changing his manifestation a new manifestation taking the throne God revealing himself in a new way am so what John saw here was a lamb not being offered the book not asking for the book but taking the book nobody could just do that with God the way we think think God is you have to really understand this now this is symbolic of a son coming to maturity in our carnal thinking how could any lesser being just take something from a higher being more powerful being so clearly that's not what the symbol is revealing do you believe it's saying amen a change over from father to son the relationship of God to man becoming closer the mystery of God one part of it CH already manifesting father to son God who was father God becoming son right amen God that was one part in other words Christ was making it possible for man to get the revelation of who God is the father becoming the son in Jesus Christ was only a stepping stone to bring the book back to man amen amen no man cometh to the father but by me that's what it actually means there's no way for man to get the mystery of God unless I came and was manifested here in flesh oh Hallelujah the Seven Seals now was this problem because so he took the book but now these seals have to be broken amen because the work of Satan and the sinfulness of man man was not yet ready to take the book even with the gifts of the Holy Ghost and the power of God through the church ages they spoke with tongues they prophesied they healed the sick they raised the dead they crossed oceans they were bitten by serpents they drank poisons they had so much of power and with all that holy ghost power they were still not worthy amen so the lamb had to sit on the throne for 2,000 years of church ages waiting for the Holy Ghost to finish find the worthy ones whose names were in the book when the time was wi he would come down himself and what put the book in the hands of man he comes down with an open book in his hand Revelations 1 uh paragraph 1 180 Revelation 5 part 2 you still with me they could not hold it for that I pass that 50th day cuz that was a day of Jubilee when everything went back to its original beginning and the power of God was taken back to its original 50th day let's go to the next paragraph there will come another Year of Jubilee and that we've had it about this time if you notice Pentecost has been falling in America for about 50 years somewhere in that time just about 50 years ago Pentecost Begin to Fall now what's happening the church is receiving the seven seal book of the revelation of Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals and not one tenth of them can receive it that's right listen I'm going to say it again open your eyes amen this Prophet is telling you 5050 years ago Pentecost began to fall right now the seven seal book which was sealed is open sir we are receiving it and no one's available or ready to take it that's right not one/ tenth of them he confirmed for us that the book was descending amen the book was sealed to man those seals had to be broken so that man could know what is written within the book so his next Duty the Lamb's Duty was to open the seals for us because no man was worthy to do that and what happens right Revelations 5: 8-9 and when he had taken the book please I don't want to preach too long so you are you seeing what taking the book means okay the four beasts and the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of olders which are the prayers of saints symbols and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book Thou Art Worthy they sang a new song Amen and new worship comes off Amen in other words they are seeing these people who are recognizing the lamb amen taking the book it brings a new worship to them right it's not some new song We'll learn sometime this is happening this has happened amen and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain has redeemed us unto God God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and nation that law statement tells us it's worldwide amen notice how things changed when the lamb uh sat down in the throne you know brother mam says he took the the book and sat down in the throne right so those four beasts and 20 Elders always fall down and worship whoever is in the throne with the book amen right so here he takes the book he sits down they do exactly what they did in Revelations 4 amen amen they fall down before Christ showing us that the rulership of Heaven Was now under a new manifestation a new name the name of Jesus all worship was now directed in his name a new song and he redeemed us unto God let's move on chap uh verse 10 and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall rain on the earth can you see it coming closer it's bringing us to Reign to rule it was now revealed that the lamb was putting rulership back in the hands of man because that was what was lost we will take back our Earth from this Beast system that's running mankind the only way we can is by taking this book we will take back our Earth yes amen the kings of this Earth and Satan uh will take it back from them we will do this only by the book and that he will place in our hands because he became man the book shifted again from Heaven to Earth that's where it's coming to do you see it okay so he was the second Adam displaying the book in the hands of man this is why there was need for a second Adam and he went away and shared his promise was to share his mystery of God With Us amen you believe that amen who is Christ The Mystery of God revealed amen that's not a trinitarian Doctrine no Christ The Mystery of God revealed it didn't even say Jesus the mystery of God revealed it said Christ what is Christ a fleshly vessel a messiah is a fleshly vessel an Earthly vessel Christ is a man amen let's say the another way the anointed man was the mystery of God revealed what how do we know because when they asked him what will be the sign of your coming he said false christs will arise there will be men on Earth who will claim to be me who will claim to be Christ who will make it look like they will have the book so Saints Church what are we without this book absolutely nothing without the open book that's Revelations 101 verse two verse 1 and two and I saw another Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as PL as a fire and he had in his hand a little book open amen and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left on the earth you love him Saints amen this book is now opened this book there's a prophecy Revelations 10 you need to be excited this prophecy is telling us the book is coming to Earth Amen to back where it belongs and who brings it the lamb himself he well how do we know Salam no brother Alice it's a mighty Angel not the almighty Angel not angel with a capital A oh come on come on this is an angel who shares the Sevenfold Glory of his person he's got a white wig his eyes as flames of fire his feet as fine bras that's the revelation of his person the Sevenfold uh per revelation of his person from The pmus Vision there's no other angel that has it it is Christ it is the Lamb himself the book is in the hand of that angel this was not some other Angel it was Christ himself no other Angel shares those characteristics and then what happens young people verse 8 of Revelations 10 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again again who's me John the man you and I on Earth Watching seeing experiencing the lamb descending the angel says to us go take the book who this is the same thing that happened in Revelations 5 this is not Lord I'm So Unworthy I really need that book lord this message you know it sir I I've really been trying to keep the Cod I can you see that son of the born woman yes right I'm I'm I'm almost there I'm not really there you know Lord I the voice says go take the book go take the mystery of God I know you believe it and I know our trial our trial is I believe that brother Alis but the reality of it you know still needs to work itself in me cuz I'm still unworthy I'm still I know I'm going through the same thing go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel who standed upon the SE upon the Earth he is standing with a book open and he says it is for you everything was done to bring it back to you all that was accomplished the mystery of God is finished the seventh messenger has given his message the book is here go take it amen amen and the prophecy you believe all the Prophecies of Revelation you believe the others have come to pass you believe it's as sure as sure can be this prophecy says and I went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take it eat it up and it shall be and shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be thy mouth as sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand that means it was transferred it passed from Heaven to me it passed from Christ to me he made it worthy he made it possible he made me worthy he brought it down and the prophecy says it passed from his hand to mine glory to God and as soon as I eat it everything he said came to pass made it possible made it true I begin to experience everything he said would be sweet in the mouth and bitter in the belly easy to love easy to worship easy to praise but it's difficult to become alive it's difficult it's going to take some victory it's going to take some fighting amen that voice from Heaven speaks to John and who represents the believer take the book the book crosses hands was not meant to be on a throne of Heaven it was meant to be in your hand and my hand that's what the Plan of Redemption was all about and what is the mystery of God Christ amen Christ Christ is an anointed man the mystery of God is the right to rule praise God that's what it actually means to be God man's understanding of God is an idol right who we sing to bow down to worship say nice words to him that's not what it means to be God Moses you shall be God and Aaron thy Prophet amen God means the right to rule the right to have dominion over all things Adam was God on Earth am that's what we lost this is what come this is the purpose of the Bride the bride is not some fancy term in the message that just means we're extra special Elite people that will be transported one day into a happy place Bride is a responsibility bride means bride reflects the equality of man and God come back again co-ee equality that was lost by sin in the beginning that separated the first husband and wife bride means marriage bride shows the two coming back Heaven and Earth embracing the the book can only come back to someone who has had that or is part of that not someone living under law or Grace or intercession someone who is Bri is expressing God and man becoming one and the book can only come back to that manifestation that's why it had to wait and the Mystery of God has been finished all that it took to bring a bride has been finished all the messengers all the preachers all the prophets priests psalmist Kings sages all the books written everything every word that was meant to be spoken has been complete it is ready there is the mystery of God ready on Earth and a a vessel to receive the book the right to rule but that right to rule was sealed with Seven Seals and this is where the Bond woman and her son came in cuz they were the cause of it right because there in the church ages the Bond woman was that Roman Catholic system that then took the very mystery of Christ and who he is and sealed it with white horse rider red horse rider on and on and what did they do with it they took the power for themselves they made it at the church and then they made it the pope and he became the representative just doing that making him a representative of Christ and telling you you can only come to God through him and then you became so bad you couldn't even go to him directly you had to go to St Christopher or Mary and pray to Mary to pray to Jesus to Jesus to the father and then even before that even even if you got that right you're still unworthy you to come to the pope now we're not picking on the Catholic church that format passed down to every Church am yes what does that do to a human who believes in Christ who does not understand he's always going to feel unworthy he's always going to never know what it is to be God here we are sitting in this you know when we preach this series in our church I had the question and I I love the question it was brother Al you know if we are God who do we pray to it was a sincere question and the question was that way because we are people who always imagine someone else we are praying to because we have been brought up with this this culture this tradition I was telling brother Chad the other day I said one of these days when my 8-year-old is grown up and he understands more respect I'm going to sit at our lunch table dinner table and I'm going to say I bless this food in the name of Jesus Christ because I've come to that understanding that I can bless something yes amen I believe it I bless this food I can always have the traditional prayer Lord bless this food and make sure it's not poisonous you know and keep me safe and give it strength to our bodies and whatever when let me ask you something when you pray for something does God send an angel to do it for you no do you not know that you go out and do it yourself right you go out somehow and get it done yourself who's doing that it is the mystery of God in you getting what you prayed for to yourself that potential is in you God is literally working through you the mystery of God is literally working through you for whatever you need it's going to go out and come back through what you do it's no longer Christian traditions this is a reality am he's not sending some angel with something that plops down in front of you and zap miracle thank you Lord for providing this it's going out and and and and it's expanded because it'll it'll happen through somebody else in the body somebody else in the body something else happened even the fact that you walk into places and there's unbelievers who will get things done for you to the nth degree we don't even know why they did it amen it's because it's happening through you am you got to start believing this Saints what are those seals and this is where we're closing it down this is where we come to that Bond woman and her son it is sealed because of that b Bond woman and her son they were the ruling power they took over the carnal nature what is the carnal nature what is the right to rule sealed with yes first one is a religious spirit right that's right amen your religious spirit yeah amen right your way of praying going to church being a religious person loving the Lord in some religious way uh believing in the blood of Christ the way Pentecost preached it yes the church you came from the culture you had that's a white horse rider it's an impost amen it's not the real belief in Christ it's not the real belief in God it's what stemmed from the denomination you came from what is a red horse rider it's taking religion and law and joining it for control you can do that in your family you can do that as a husband you can do that as a person in yourself right as long as you have a religious spirit m a political Spirit yeah a black horse rider a pale horse rider the fifth seal an eye for an eye a tooth for tooth how long can you uh avenge us oh God that is a spirit of Vengeance a Son of God cannot take the land cannot take the book with a spirit of Vengeance the six seal is all about what wars earthquakes trauma rumors of wars pestilences famine amen Translate that to your life the seals of your life what is that family issues financial problems illness I got cancer I got this disease I've got that disease someone else is sick I lost my child I lost my husband uh Church problems Church splits false doctrines that's a six seal right there it's an interruption of nature if all those things still affect you it still seals the book that's right because if all those things still affect you how are you going to be God right how how will you rule if those things make you question who you are and question God right I'm not coming to church anymore I've been such a good person where is God in my need where is God in my time of need how could this have happened to me I'm sorry I got to tell the truth amen if you are unable to deal as being the bride deal with Petty things like that if you come to a place where Petty things like that make you question God question his Prophet listen to these people discrediting the prophet questioning the cloud and puts a thing in your heart to say how could this happen amen bromism this is happening in the message we can't trust listen if you're a person who have a spirit of racism in you you cannot take the book that's right if you have any kind of prejudice you cannot take the book if you even feel inferior to someone else you cannot take the book you need to get over yourself praise the Lord that's what the seals of your life are you cannot take the book unless the revelation of this day breaks those seals away so you personally can take the right to rule you can never overcome and what do we want to rule first the Bor woman and a son need to be cast out how can we cast them out we read a quote last night you cannot do this by yourself you cannot do this by works you cannot do it by church this is why everything fails right now tongues prophecies interpretations fasting prayer religiosity praying five times a day having prayer meetings having Holy Ghost Services nothing can work because those seals of your life have to be broken there's no other way that you can have the mystery of God and still be affected by those things praise be to God it is Christ revealed in you God is dwelling in you this is the original purpose amen let's read these quotes quickly and then we can close the breach message this seven seal book is revealed at the time of the seventh THS of Revelations 10 done amen I believe it the mystery of the the seven seal book will be revealed at the sounding of the seven Church Angels message I believe it amen the seven Angel begins to sound there's the messages wrote out there got it on Cape and book form I believe it amen at the beginning of the sounding of the message the mystery of God should be finished I believe it now we will notice the book of The Mystery of God is Not revealed until the seventh Angel's messenger message is sounded I believe it yes his message is sounded that means the book of The Mystery of God is revealed these points will be important in the seals I'm sure cuz it must every bit tie together now it's wrote mysterious because no man knows where it is God alone Jesus Christ yes God Amen paragraph 39 Bridge message now but it is a book a mystery mysterious book it's a book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probed that through six church church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all those loose hands that these fellows probed at amen and the Mystery the Mysteries comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God Amen then the godhead and everything else is settled I love that because as long as the this these seals are are not broken and listen please make it personal every time you read it sir stop talking about the seals like a white horse rider from Paul's day talk about your seals as soon as these seals are open everything else is settled why do I still have questions on the godhead why are things in the word still bugging me why can I not understand this you know what when I don't understand something I always believe it first am and then I look for the understanding to confirm what I believe I don't go the other way around let's look for it and then when I understand it then I believe I believe first then I understand glory to God Saints then the godhead and everything else marriage and divorce message is not given to you as a solution to bad problems I I hate that I hate to use the the marriage and divorce messes to handle messy marriages I want to preach so we don't have messy marriages I want to preach so we don't have divorces I don't want to have solutions to bad things I want to preach I want to have the word so we stop the bad things glory to God Amen and he says all the Mysteries serpent seed becomes clearer after after your seals are open that's right ser and Seed becomes clearer and whatever more is to be revealed now you see I'm just not making that up that's what it's thus sayith the Lorden amen paragraphs uh we we're closing musicians can come up and there's only one thing left when the seven seal book is open then the entire mystery of God why we Prov at it through the years and according to the scripture then when there was no way to understand it until this day you believe the entire mystery of God yes sir entire finished there's no more manifestation after the bride in the dimension of time that's it it's over amen we probed at it through the years and according to the scripture when there was no way to understand it until this day because it's been hereit we've seen the symbol what it was symbolized by but it could not be correctly revealed until the last day now then we must be there at the end time praise be to God I believe it which brings us to the theme the mystery of God is the right to rule amen and the right to rule gives you the power to put out the born woman and her son prise God glory to God this is what brings it together come and take the book amen the mystery of God is the right to rule do not do not faint at it no one is saying that if the bride is God manifested in flesh that we are people who are standing here and accepting worship from others and we are placing ourselves above Jesus Christ they don't understand what it means to be God that's why they're stumbling at it what does it mean to be God to rule God is an English word which God himself didn't make up yeah we made it up and messed it up he just used what we understand the word God is a different word in many other languages du deity yes sir right all different words what does it mean man has transferred that meaning by his interpretation to be an idol who people bow down to and worship and exall as greater than them but to God the word god means to rule to sit in the throne to hold the book to control things of creation on Earth he was God when Angels were created before that he was a self-existing one he became a father when he brought forth Sons he became the man Christ when he came to be an intercessor for sin but being God is included in the mystery of the father in the mystery of Christ amen and the bride is the final manifestation that is our faith this is the reason there's a us that the book had to be brought down to us do you believe that the mystery of God is the right to rule and the right to rule is what gives you the power to cast out the carnality of the Flesh and the worship that emanates from the carnality of the Flesh in other words the right to rule will cancel out the conception of sexual desire amen and that's what takes us in the translation that's what makes it possible for us to be put back back in touch with our theophany and then come back again for the Millennium in Perfection and we shall Rule and Reign praise the Lord let's stand together brother Chad amen our brothers can lead us in a song may the Lord bless you the Lord be with you I'll be leaving tomorrow but you'll be in my heart as I know you I am in yours and you're praying for us as we pray for for you that we 10,000 mil away from each other we are united in this this book is in our hands we have Great Fellowship one with another and God has blessed us blessed art thou among all women the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ God's people the book back in the hands of men God bless you brother ch [Music] [Applause] [Music] Mercy made us free from sin today oh the joy that fills my soul for the message is my all thank you Jesus for this day of Victory they were beaten and so we we slaves awaiting the Day of Victory just to see the Glorious Sunrise from the highest mountain toop in this day we'll see their shackles falling on it's the rising of the Sun a new day has begun Mercy made us free from sin today for the joy that fills my soul for the message is my all thank you Jesus for this day of Liberty amen amen are you thankful that you're free amen free from what we we've known we're free from denomination we're free from false ideas free from Traditions but oh how we've been learning that I need to be free from this amen I got out of denominations but I still carried this out of the denomination I still carried this we brought it into the message and has been troubling us all along but Paul began to bring a message message that would show us how to possess our vessels and I believe this message in the end time has come to perfectly give us understanding on how to P possess how to rule the Earth amen I've said before and I've thought before we want to rule the Earth we want to get to the Millennium we want to be Kings and Priests but God has given us one little patch of Earth to start with and that's this patch right here and we're learning how to rule and reign as those SE seals break the mystery off of us and we realize who it is that's in us and we don't have to succumb to this patch of Earth we can rule it it's not to rule us oh what an eye openening lesson we have friends amen it's not this kind of teaching sometimes scares people because you being a man make yourself equal to God is so somehow we begin to rule over each other and we begin to dict no this Revelation come so that I will possess this vessel and bring it subject to God and obedience and surrender to manifest Jesus Christ upon this earth right here amen it's all about me the Revelation to one person to the individual to do what to give us the power to overcome what man's never been able to overcome maam said it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in David but Noah couldn't overcome Noah Moses couldn't overcome Moses and David couldn't overcome David yeah but now it's Christ in you the hope of glory and God has come and give us a book and God Has Come himself to enter into his bride so that we can break the cycle prise the Lord thank you Lord God help us Amen to cast out the Bond woman amen and the son of the Bond woman this is real Freedom friends sir real Freedom amen God be praised this is the desire of my heart the desire of my heart is to surrender all of this to Christ's purpose that's my greatest desire my greatest accomplishment on this Earth will not to be to do to do some miracle that other people see the greatest desire brother B brother B said the greatest Miracle is a changed Life greatest works that we can do is bring this Bit of Earth subject to the word to manifest Christ upon the Earth amen God be praised just want to say we love you and God be with you yes as we part we've come to the end of a weekend of meetings it was wonderful it was glorious but I believe God's imparted something into us that will give us a greater Victory am Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday the point of the meeting was not to shout in the sanctuary the point of the meeting was to go live the life by the Revelation that God's given in us the the purpose of these weekend meetings will show up Tuesday morning when you face a trial on the way to work when your flesh wants to hijack the work of God and send you in another Direction that's that's when the power of this word will come to manifestation say God let it live inside of me that's my desire say God bless you we've loved being here so thankful that you were here with us may God be praised man let's just bow our heads together and thank God for his word dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus that you've been so good to us that you're continually Lord taking taking and peeling back Lord that that that peeling back the layers of Revelation

bound the spiritual Amnesia that kept us separated and God you've done it by a revelation of yourself God I pray that you would help this Revelation Lord to to become the reality that we live in not what our eyes see or ears hear but what our ears of Revelation our soul perceives and picks up and understands to be true May that become the reality we walk in and may it bring this reality subject to the greatest reality of all God I pray you'd help your people that you would bless them Lord as you bless them with your word May that word come into our lives and take effect may become a
