[0:00] She is his body which is what the
[0:03] manifested truth of the promised word
[0:05] for the last days. And she and she alone
[0:08] stands by it.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody else believes this.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; She's the only one who stands with the
[0:14] true revelation of the true word. And
[0:16] it's in her only. It's nowhere else. You
[0:19] don't find this revelation anywhere
[0:20] else. This manifestation. Because if you
[0:23] love me, you keep my words. And if you
[0:24] keep my words, what words? All of my
[0:27] word. Yeah.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Then my father will love you and we will
[0:31] come into you and make our abode with
[0:32] you in that day. That's this day,
[0:35] friends.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; And she alone stands by it. That's why
[0:39] the devil is howling. And these great
[0:40] organizations set up try to set up
[0:43] something to close her up. They'll never
[0:45] do it. She'll be taken up, not closed
[0:47] up. She is now. Oh my goodness. She is
[0:50] now risen. And by the power of the
[0:53] vindicated word promised her, she is
[0:55] risen. Risen from what? risen from dead
[0:57] denominationalism. Risen from the
[0:59] darkness of obscurity of the word, but
[1:01] she's risen back to what? She's been
[1:03] awakened by the latter reign. Amen.
[1:05] There's been nothing to stir the bride
[1:07] yet. Amen. But now they're crying for
[1:09] revivals. Revival. Revival. Why? Because
[1:12] they they know something's got to
[1:13] happen, but they haven't recognized the
[1:15] awakening of the bride. She has risen by
[1:18] the power of the vindicated word
[1:20] promised to her.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; She's now been raised up like Ezekiel's
[1:24] dry bones. She's now come back to what
[1:27] she was supposed to be. And now he's
[1:29] pouring his full word into her.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; And the devil's howling
[1:35] &gt;&gt; about this manifestation of the truth of
[1:37] the promised word in her alone.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown?
[1:46] What was the Mount Carmel showdown?
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; One prophet.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; The voice of God.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. the vindicated voice of God
[1:57] against every other voice.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; What was Mount Transfiguration?
[2:03] Hear ye him. One man, the fullness of
[2:06] the word and every other voice silenced.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; What is the Mount Zion showdown? Him and
[2:13] her. The word and her alone. And she's
[2:16] the only one that stands by it. And
[2:18] every other voice is silent. No
[2:20] denomination, no creed, no other
[2:22] teaching. This is the truth of Jesus
[2:24] Christ. This is the revelation of Jesus
[2:27] Christ. This is the mystery of God
[2:29] revealed.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; That's what they're howling about the
[2:34] revelation
[2:35] in her
[2:37] &gt;&gt; alone.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
