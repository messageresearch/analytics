while I'm gone here on Sunday uh brother Simon Abbott will be taking the service so be praying for him as well and then I've asked brother Benjamin seabold if he'll take Wednesday and that gives us a

Benjamin will be preaching so I appreciate his help with that also I uh my wife and I went over to see brother Mike and sister Carolyn sprunger and they wanted us to convey to you all their thanks they so appreciate all the cards that they received all the text that they received and all the meals that the ladies had made for them and taken over and so they they're doing well they're recovering they were pretty banged up and bruised and beat up and sore but they're recovering they're doing better day by day and God's been good to them and they know that God has preserved their life so they know they still have a purpose purpose to serve amen and they're they're ready to get back to that purpose amen so just continue to pray for them as they recover but they wanted us to express their gratitude then back here in Revelation 8 verse1 uh We've we've looked at this many times and I want to I want to look at it again um brother Franco if you could go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint for me I'm going to go through a PowerPoint we're going to do a little bit of review and it's not all review but some review and I'm want to preach on the White Rock and a white stone and uh you'll see why we titled that as we move along uh the last time uh brother Gabe preached he started touching on some of these things and him and I had a conversation around back that I got pretty excited about and we were just touching on some points and and uh and I can't get it off my mind and so I came and uh preached uh Sunday and on Sunday I started touching on Junior Jackson's dream and the and the White Rock and the dream and started touching on some of those things but I actually left feeling quite rushed like I just rushed through it and I and and I hate doing that and so I just was determined as we were moving into Wednesday I started meditating on it and I just determined that we're going to back up and do a little review and really lay down the foundation because I realized uh I thought that you know we talk about this all the time I've preached it over and over again and we have but when I went back and looked on the last time I preached on Junior Jackson's dream and the White Rock it was five years ago and a lot changes in 5 years we've got young people coming up we've got new people moving into the assembly and then some of us don't remember everything and so it's so good to go over it again amen and so I really I really when I looked into it I said I want to touch on that once again it is the heart of the message it's it's the heart of what God has done in this day and it means so much to us and when we look at Revelation uh 8 if you could back up with me and look at chapter 5 we're just going to do a scan we're not going to read but in chapter 4 we come to the in chapter 3 we come to the end of the church ages uh and then John is told uh to come up higher and there's an open door in heaven and in chapter 4 he moves through the open door this is after the church ages are over he moves into a higher realm amen and in that realm he sees the throne room of God and he sees one sit on the throne amen and then in chapter 5 there's a cry that goes out amen who is Worthy come and take the book and loose the seals and no one no man in heaven or on Earth or under the Earth was found worthy to take the book to loose the seals or even to look therein but then he says he starts to weep because he knows if nobody can take this book all Redemption is lost amen and then an elder says to him weep not John for the lion of the tribe of the Judah has prevailed Amen to take the book and the loose the seals thereof and when he looked he looked for a lion but he saw a lamb a bleeding beat up lamb and and he took the book and he and when he took the book there was singing and rejoicing in heaven and then we come to chapter 6 when we come to chapter six the lamb begins to break the seals and so in chapter 6 uh verse one says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so we see that now the lamb has taken the book in in chapter 6 and he begins to open the seals and now we have an opening of the seals but this opening of the seals is opening brother bandam said in a church form and so in a symbol form it opened enough symbolically so you can see the symbols that were veiled in there so you wouldn't get the real revelation of it but the symbols just so the church would know that there's something to it so he said it come forth in a church symbol symbolizing that there's a seal and here's the symbol of the seal it symbolized with a white horse rider going forth but the revelation of what that means is not there yeah right and he goes through chapter six and he goes through all six seals and so through through the six seals in chapter six then it breaks into chapter 7 chapter 7 is a chapter that that explores the uh tribulation period and the 144,000 ceiling and and those that came through Great Tribulation then we come to Revelation 8 when we come to Revelation 8 now we're going to see the lamb open the seventh seal all right and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour so now we already recognize that though it's opened in symbol form we're catching the symbol that when he opened this seal it's not like the other six when he opened the other six something happened we saw a white horse there was a lot of symbols that went went with that he had a crown was given he had a bow amen we saw there was no arrows you see so much information under the six but under the seventh there's nothing silence and so then let's go over to Revelation chap 10 we're going to jump because Revelation chap 10 is also the seventh sealen I'm just going to tell you that I'm not going to I'm not going to prove it to you en tile the scripture we'll look into it later but Revelation 10 1:7 brother brandham says is the seventh seal so Revelation 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire brother B said this is Christ so in the seventh seal now when we come over to Revelation 10 which is the seventh seal amen now we see the coming of Christ as the mighty angel now we're not we're not talking about about the flesh man that was crucified but we're talking about Jesus Christ Christ The Mighty angel coming spiritually amen and he had in his hand a little book open and brother B said this is the same book that was closed and sealed in chapter 5 now it's open in chapter 10 so we see now there's an open book in the seventh seal in this coming and he had in his hand a little book open and he sat his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying it to me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so this is where brother benam starts to talk about amen those seals that were sealed all right because now there's there's when he Roars like a lion seven Thunders utter their voice and John was about to write because brother B tells us John heard the Thunders and knew what they were they were intelligible they were something he understood and comprehended and was able to write out what the seven Thunder said but the voice told him not to write them but to seal them up so now we have Seven Seals you understand why seven Thunders seven Revelations cuz each Thunder was a voice of God speaking something and each Thunder was now sealed Again by John so there you have Seven Seals right this is why brother B says you have seven seals on the inside of the book and Seven Seals on the back side of the book amen he says now the the ones on the back side of the book aren't open he said there's nothing written about them we have we have nothing there's not one word written about them he's talking about these seven Thunders that John was told to seal right amen okay so brother's never talking about 14 seals yeah but there's seals that we see open in a church form or symbol form now there's Thunders that are a voice of God declaring something but he's told to seal them up so now there's seven SEALS or the Thunders are sealed those are the Seven Seals brother man talks about on the back side of the book sometimes he talk about backside and within and he he sometimes switches it but you understand what he's talking about amen we don't want to you know sometimes the brother brandham is so perfect for what God wanted to use him for God wanted to use him to declare a truth amen but he didn't want to use him to intellectually explain anything amen because he had to leave it in mystery form so that only the bride would get the revelation of what he was bringing so he was perfectly suited to do what God wanted him to do amen even brother Benham says I hope you understand what I'm trying to say I don't have education enough to explain it he says but I know what I'm talking about so and and brother bham is catching the Revelation by Vision amen and he's trying to explain what he's seeing brother B you have to understand he's not catching the Revelation out of a textbook so he can't read it and repeat to you what he just read because that would be intellectual but he's a profit and he's getting it by vision and he's trying to discern himself the vision and explain because the vision is not coming with words there's no words it's a vision the vision brings a revelation now it's up to him to try to bring words together to explain the Revelation and God used a hillbilly from Kentucky with the seventh grade education so that he could come and explain what he saw and it would still be veiled to the intellectual mind so that we wouldn't get it through intellectualism we could only get it by Revelation from the father so many times I wish he would just explain it plain he's not supposed to explain it plain he's just supposed to tell you what he sees oh I love it so much amen and many times when you see brother B he's even trying to understand what he's seeing cuz the Revelation didn't come from a textbook it didn't get it in a text message he got it through vision and we would think that the prophet would have it so clear and so easily spelled out amen and he would just read no it it that's not the way it came it came by vision and he himself got a revelation off that vision and now he's trying to preach his Revelation that's right amen praise God this thing is is only going to be given and revealed by revelation so now these seven Thunders were sealed says SE seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things that are therein that there should be time no longer this is really important phrase time no longer that's why brother brandham says this seventh seal is the end time seal he's looking at this section in scripture and that's where he's getting it that's why when he preaches um is this the sign of the Enders he's asking the question is this the sign of the ERS is this those seven Thunders is this what H took place in Revelation 10 because that Mighty Angel when he raised his hand and and he declared time shall be no more mark This is the End Time amen the end of time so that's when all this happens that's right amen that time should be no longer verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets praise God so now let's let's launch in I've got a lot to go through and I got a lot of quotes but I put almost everything on the overhead amen so we'll just keep going as quickly as we can uh in the message is this the sign of the end sir I want you to notice that title I mentioned it to you before but don't forget the question is is this the sign of the answer and why is he coming to preach this message he's coming to preach this message because he had an experience the week before and the experience the week before amen it was like it was a capping off of six dreams different brothers and sisters came to give him so in this message he explains to you all six dreams the brothers were coming over a period of a few months and they gave him a dream and then another dream and he didn't give any of them the interpretation of the dream he just kept hearing them then another one come and another dream and another dream and another dream and another dream amen and then he has this experience in his room amen early one morning amen where all of a sudden he goes into a vision and in the vision he sees uh Little Birds a little cluster of little birds coming and they're flying towards them and they light on a branch and they fly off amen and then little bigger birds like doves they they come and they fly off and he understands that this is the first and second pool amen The Healing Ministry that went off and then the discernment that flew and then the next amen there was a constellation of seven angels in a pyramid form he said amen and then there was a blast that went off amen he got caught up amen and he nearly lost himself he say it took him hours to come out of that he was caught up into this constellation of angels amen at the same time he finds out that they're going to widen his Street and when he finds out they're going to widen his street they're going to have to take out his gate and it reminds him of a vision he had years ago of where his gate was laying there was rocks all around amen and remember he ends up there was a smart like there and he punches him he slaps him down he picks him up slaps him down again and said I'm not mad at you you just can't talk to me that way I wish I could slap somebody down not be mad at him I but this is a vision you know and so and then in the vision says uh be careful be cautious when this happens go west and then he saw himself in a prairie scooner with his family loaded in like they were traveling and they were going to the West right and so now at the same time all of this everything's culminating and coming together at once and he's finding out they're going to widen the street and they're going to take out take out his gate and those were the rocks that he saw laying around and all of a sudden with this experience he realizes now this is the time that I have to go west and he's asking is this the sign of the ins is this the end time and he comes back and preaches the he comes back and preaches the seventh seal and in the seventh seal he says this is the end time so it was questioned before the seals is this the sign of the end and and he answers it in the seven seal and says this is the end time this is the sign of the end absolutely he was correct so he vindicates everything that he was saying in CES is the time all the speculation and what he was probing at and amen when he comes to the seventh seal proves to be true so now in this message is this the sign of the answer I want to read and and note I want you to note this is taking place this is a Sunday evening service on December 30th next to the last day it's not the last day of the year I made a mistake and said that wrong before it's not the last day of the year the next day they'll have a watch Night Service and that's important because we're going to get to a quote out of that watch Night Service he says is this the sign of the inser and he said he came to me and he said something is on my heart I must tell you brother brandom I said go on brother Jackson and he said I dreamed a dream and there it was when he says there it was that means he's seeing it now yeah and there it was I just sat still and I listened and watched he said I dreamed that there was a great big hill like out in a field where Blu grass or something was and said and said up on top of this hill where the water had washed away the soil there was a top rock up on top the hill like the top of a mountain it was Rock no grass and where the water had washed down it had cut some kind of readings on these stones and you were standing there interpreting this reading on these stones and said all of us and here is the way he put it said the Brethren from George and from all around we were all standing together listening to you interpret that mysterious writing on those stones that mountain and he said then you picked up something like from the air something like a wrecking bar or crowbar wasn't it Brothers something like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said it how you done it I don't know said you struck the top of that mountain ripped it around and lifted the cap of it off it was in the shape of a pyramid and you ripped the top of it off now that was months and months and months before the pyramid message was preached what pyramid message is he talking about here he's talking about stature of a perfect man that's important to know cuz stature of a perfect man was was it was the capping off of the adoption message so we have to understand this has everything to do with adoption and adoption is the full maturity at the end time amen it's all ties together friends sir and he said it said beneath that was White Stone Granite and you said the Sun or the light has never shined on this before look look in on this watch this and that's right because in the formation of the world the world was formed before there was light we all know that God moved upon the water and then he began he spoke for light naturally down under there in the age that formation was that light had never come upon the stone he's talking about in the natural form of it amen the earth was formed before the light came so he's showing that within this Rock Amen was a White Rock and light had never shined on that before means it had never been illuminated or seen before amen this is going to be a revelation that light had never shined on on before because a stone is a type of Revelation amen and so now there's the night's never shine nobody's looked on this but he says now when I take the top off he's telling the Brethren now you look on this right but there was nothing to read it was just a White Rock oh this is so good these all these details mean something and so just just just listen as we tie them together these brothers were told to stand and look at this White Rock yeah what are they supposed to see I don't know there's nothing written on it but they're supposed to stand and look at it said light has never shined on this before because there was a revelation contained within the word that nobody had seen before it was the mystery of God and it was that mystery that was held in the back part of God's mind which no light had ever shined on before nobody had seen back to the back part of God's mind it was hidden or veiled within God himself self and light had never shined on that the same thing with this White Rock it's a revelation that light had never shined on before now he said look on this watch this he said and he he said look and and he said look upon this light has never come upon it before and when all of them got up and I told them to watch that and all of them come up to look in but he said while they were looking in he looked out the corner of his eye I believe it was and watched me I slipped off to one side and started going towards the West towards the setting of the sun come up a hill go down a hill come up a hill go down a hill getting smaller and smaller and went all the way out of sight so what happened was in the he's now he's interpreting the vision the last thing he told the brothers was you look on this white stone and they saw brother Brenham going to the West all right so let's look at this uh quote together and and then notice in some mysterious way we picked up out of the air a sharp tool that opened up the top and in there was white granite but it wasn't interpreted there was no letters I didn't interpret that Junior I just looked at it and said to the Brethren look on this and that's fulfilled tonight brother Brenham said that part where he said look on this it was being fulfilled right there in that service on December 30th in the evening service on Sunday he's telling them what is the White Rock he told them to look at he starts off his message and serves as this the time Revelations 10 1-7 showing them that there was seven Thunders that were sealed and nothing not one word was written about it and nobody knows what it is and that's the White Rock he's telling them to look at he peeled the top off of it and the capping of the Bible is in Revelation he took the cap off of it and told them there's something here that has to be revealed and that's the Fulfillment of that first part of Junior Jackson's dream and he comes to the people in this message and he says look at these Thunders could it be these Thunders something has to be revealed these Thunders it's never been known what the Thunders were and he's preaching Thunders Thunders Thunders Thunders all through is this the sign of the end sir and he's pointing them to the mysterious white rock that lights never shined on there's not one word written about the Thunders amen and then what does he tell him at the end of the service I'm going west and that's the the last part of Junior Jackson's dream he's going west he said and while they were studying that I slipped towards the West what for here's this question what for maybe to understand the interpretation of what's on top of this could it be so all through this message this message title is a question is this the sign of the end sir all through the message he's asking questions yeah amen so he's going to come back from the west and answer all these questions so here brother Franco helped me put this together I thought he did a marvelous job so they they there was a hill in the dream and and on the hill the coming out the top where the water had run down and washed it off was a rock and there was writings in it that had got etched in by the water and brother Benham was going around interpreting and brother bam tells us all the time amen that he he was there to tie up the Loose Ends from the seven Church ages amen those things that were lost amen but what were they they were scriptures amen they were scriptures that had been lost on water baptism in jesus' name on The Serpent seed on the godhead on all of these things and he says when and brother's clear he says when he's done tying together the Loose Ends then the S thunder sound so in the vision he's going around and when he finishes interpreting the writing on the outside side when he finishes interpreting what's written in the word tying together all the Loose Ends from the church ages now it's time to find out what's inside so when he was done interpreting he grabbed that sharp tool and peeled the top off and showed them that there's something that light's never shined on before nobody's even been able to read it on the outside yeah amen right not even a symbol of it y nothing silence and so he pulls the top off and he tells them brothers to stay there and look at it and then he goes west and when he goes west now this is December all right 1962 and just a few weeks later in February 20 or yeah Fe not not February 28th in January sometime just a few weeks after that he's out west and he goes to sabinaa Canyon and he calls all the way up amen the pull pit Rock and while he's standing there praying he's got his hands in the air and when his hands are in the air something strikes his hand and when he looks it's a sword and he says oh it's a sword and the voice said the king sword amen and and then and then he starts thinking about well a king and he says in his heart inside it thundered out the king sword and he realizes this is the king sword and he said it fit my hand perfectly and he told us later what it was it's the word in the hand meaning the word is going to come to the prophet and that in January then in in in February 28th amen that's when the cloud comes down and the pictures are taken to the cloud and sometime after that brother banham is caught up into the constellation of the cloud and told to go back East for the interpretation of the revelation of the Seven Seals what did he go out there for the White Rock what did he call the White Rock the seven Thunders what was he told to go back to reveal the Seven Seals amen I love it same message time shall be no more he announces that time is over what happens what happens could that be so now Brethren seriously think if it is then the pyramid is capped by the seven Thunders you remember the pyramid message is the Capstone what did it the Holy Spirit capped off the individual sealant when we added to our faith righteousness godliness Faith this is Statue of a perfect man so for and kept adding till we got to seven things and the SE and the seventh one which is actually the eighth one is is love which is God that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got seven Church ages and he's had seven Mysteries that's been sounded away and they fought for to bring back and now the headstone comes to cap off the church does the Thunders mean that my brethren s is that where we're at yeah does the Thunders mean that that he's going to come and reveal that mystery that time is no more that we're at the end of time does the Thunders mean that Brethren and the answer is yes because when he goes out amen this is the sign that God gives amen the cloud which is seven angels Wings amen making a cloud amen that's outlining the head of Christ but it's coming down in pyramid form or Capstone form and it's a white pyramid cuz what are they they're seven angels bringing what the Rev contained in the Seven Seals which are the seven Thunders praise God and where did Brother brandom get caught up he got caught up into this amen pyramid this Capstone now in the seventh seal now I want you to note now we're in the seventh seal he's preached the seals he's come to the seventh seal remember when he comes to the seventh seal he's not allowed to explain the third pool okay I don't want you reading we are a very rebellious people if the use Force amen so now when he comes to the third pool but what was the third pool he says now we go back to his vision he has in the room the week before he preaches serves this the time says those first little birds were beat up little brown birds second was like doves he said That's The Healing Ministry and now this is discernment first and second pool but the third pull was them Angels picking me up into the secret of themselves into the white Capstone bringing me back for the revelation of the Seven Seals so what is the third pool it brother Bram said it's the opening of the word what opening of word the word that's been sealed in the pyramid that lights never shined on that would that John was told to seal up and right not amen that's what the third pull is that's what the vision's pointing us to so he's bringing him back for the third pool what was the third pool supposed to accomplish and you go back to his original and the end of 1955 he has the what we call the tent Vision dream but the tent Vision dream starts off with a fishing dream it doesn't start with ttin fish and starts off with fishing and in fishing he sees that there's rainbow trout big ones out in the deep water and all the ministers are gathered around the bank and they're all catching fish but they're all catching little fish and he sees those rainbow trout and he says I think I can catch them and so the whole point of the vision is he's trying to get the big rainbow trout what are they the Covenant fish what Covenant fish the children of God all these out here are catching little fish but he's targeting the rainbow trout and it's going to take three pools and Amen to get hooked the rainbow trout and bring them in Lord so the whole point of the third pull amen is to catch those Covenant Fetch and I think it's miraculous and amazing that in this prophet's lifetime that he goes to the river that he calls the River of No Return amen that's not the official name of the river but he calls the River of No Return and God allows this Prophet to catch the world record rainbow trout in his lifetime and have it mounted to prove that this man is a man that can catch rainbow trout he knows what he's talking about he's got the tactics is fishing down and God showed in the natural what this man was doing in the spirit world record not a big one world record the biggest one he caught because God was using him in the third pool to Target the Covenant fish so what is it that catches the bride it is the Mysteries revealed that's what's catching the bride it is the unveiling of Christ it is the unveiling of the mystery of God it's the veil being taken off the word amen and that's what's catching the bride amen praise be to God so now he comes back for the third pool and now he comes to the seventh seal now remember when he was back there he said could this be what what was I going out west for and this isn't uh when he preached is this the end of the sign sign of the ERS he says maybe to get the revelation of that White Rock could it be he said could it be now he comes to the seventh seal he says now notice now when this taken place he goes back to Junior Jackson's dream Junior was standing in the field had a big pyramid to like that and there was something wrote on the rocks and I was revealing that to the people is that right Junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now I took some kind of bar and cut it off and on the inside was right White Rock that had nothing Road on it and at that time I started out west and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word amen so he says could it be yes that's exactly what he went to get the interpretation for the unwritten word the White Rock that was underneath The Rock now if and remember when he was preaching on that rock Under The Rock he starts to whole first half of that message preaching about the Thunders and the part that was sealed and nothing written about it this has everything to do with the seven Thunders he says now if that isn't perfectly the God Almighty I want you to know what it is what am I trying to say this for friends is to show you we're at the end time what was the message he preached before he went out west is this the sign of the end sir now he comes to the seventh seal said I went West for the blast to come back to interpret the unwritten word and and and he says we are at the end time he answered the question he answered both the questions did I go for this yes is this the end yes we are at the end time Revelation 10 1-6 seven now in the seventh seal again it says the seventh angels I was in the west you remember the little bitty Messengers that went East the second messengers the doves little bit bigger bird they went East and they was with me all the time that was the first and second pool now the third come from the West sweeping forward with great terrific speed and they picked me up that was coming back East with the mystery of these Seven Seals just like it said in junior Jackson's dream that the Lord let me interpret for him there on the the inside of that pyramid there was a white stone that wasn't written on that's the reason I had to go west what Seven Seals did he have to interpret amen the ones that were sealed up on the back part of the book what the seven Thunders had said he goes on to say I want to read this last sence again that's the reason I had to go west to connect with these angels message to come back here to reveal it to the church you remember I said the next thing that will happen will be here at the church that's just exactly another thing I want you to notice what taken place and if you're listening to the tape of what time is it sir see now he starts calling it what time is it sir because now he knows the answer it's the end time you will notice that one Angel was very notable to me the rest of them was just seemed ordinarily but this Angel was noted Angel he was to me left in the constellation in the form of a pyramid and remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the mysteries of God known only to them and now they with the messenger that came to interpret that pyramid or that message of the secret of those Seven Seals which lays with inside the pyramid amen amen again in the seven seal now the angel was to my left would really be the last or seventh angel if we would count them from left to right because he was on my left we looked toward him towards the West he came towards the east would be on my left so that would be the last Angel's message very notable you remember how I said he kind of had his head back and a grape sharp wings and how he flew right to me now that is this seventh seal that seventh angel was coming to him he said he came right to me that is this seventh seal amen it's still a notable thing and we don't know what it is yet because it's not permitted to be broken praise be to God he was told you won't explain this one so why when he comes to the seven seal he comes all the way up and he says I feel to stop right here I got on my notes say no more all right now this is a little confusing when he says he was the angel on the left Amen in the constellation but he was really the seventh angel counting left to right and what brother Bram is saying is when he's standing in the west amen he's looking towards the west and he says into eternity all right he says they came out of Eternity and swept down so he's looking off into the West coming from the West if you count left to right you go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that's the seventh angel he said but when they picked me up into the constellation we were going east and going east he was the one on my left that's why brother Brenham says that and if you read through it carefully you'll see what he's talking about that's why he's the angel in the less but he's the seventh angel praise God and that's the notable one to him that's this seven seal and it comes right to him cuz brother brandham is the messenger of the seven seal now again in the seventh seal when when will it be brother brandham I cannot tell you I do not know but one of these days if we if we never meet again on this Earth We're going to meet Yonder at the Judgment seat of Christ and you will find find out that in the room the Revelation coming from God just like all the rest of them has that one of the mystery of that seal the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven Thunders that uttered their voices and there it is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it wasn't even written so we're at the end time we are here what's he saying part of that seventh seal is the revelation of the seven Thunders let's keep going did you notice when the Jews asked him that you know when he compared the scripture here with Matthew 24 with the six seals the seventh seal was left out we don't have time to go in that today but we may again here soon because you see Christ said only God himself knowed not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written you see they hushed nothing taking place then Angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming what's he talking about he's talking about the seventh seal talking about revelation 81 silence in heaven and he tying it to the seven Thunders sealed up those things that were uttered nobody knows when he's coming it's the coming of the Lord said there will be seven voices of these seven Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time whoa so the seven Thunders the seven voices of the seven Thunders will reveal the great Revelation at that time what time at the time that nobody knows when he's coming the seven seal the mystery of Revelation 81 amen it's revealed under the mystery of Revelation 10 1:7 that Reveals His coming cuz only the lamb can open the seals only the lamb can reveal the seals amen praise be to God so now now he's telling us what this seventh seal is all about it's the coming of the Lord and there'll be seven voices of those seven Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time what are they revealing they're revealing he's come because he comes with an book in his hand the mighty Angel descended sir so I believe to us if we don't know it it won't be known till that time but it will be revealed in that day in The Hour That is supposed to be revealed in this is such a veiled comment you can even see he he he halts his words he stumbles a little bit now he says I believe to us if we don't know it if we we it won't be known till that time but it will be revealed in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed [Music] in that just depends on where you're at in the sequence of time amen whether it's revealed to you or not so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God and serve him and do all that we know how to do and live good Christian lives here now we find that the Sixth Seal has been opened to us we see it and we know that this seven seal cannot be broke to the public amen until that hour arrives why cuz he won't tell this is the third pool you won't tell it to nobody it'll be when it begins it'll be a total secret now there was some reason that God let us let this seven voices be thundered because it must come for we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden Mystery that's Revelation 881 he took the book and he opened the seventh seal but there was silence see it's a hidden Myster amen no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know his coming they also would not know about this seven ther mystery so you see it's connected together amen praise God this is why brother brandom when you get into the seals and you read through your seals book the prophet of God is saying in the seals he says he says I hope you're catching what's going on and he says this throughout the seals you'll catch him saying these statements I'm just going to give you I'm paraphrasing I'm just going to give them to you as I remember he says it's going on all around you amen he says I I hope you see what's going on all around you he goes I keep waiting for somebody to stand up in their seat and say I see it brother brandom I see it can you imagine sitting in the crowd that day and you're like what what what is it you're watching is carefully as you can you're writing down his scriptures and what he's trying to get you and he's saying this not in one seal he's saying this over seven days and he says oh I hope you get it just wait till we get to Sunday night over there we get to the seventh seal because he thinks he's going to reveal it amen but then he he he's told to stop and not reveal it when he gets there amen but he's telling you you just wait till Sunday night you wait till we get over there oh just waiting for somebody like he said I'm waiting for somebody stand up and say I see it brother brandom said it's going on all around you and you're not catching it then he comes to the last day and he says you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it what were they not supposed to get what was going on on around them every day he was preaching the Thunders he come first day first Thunder second day second Thunder Third Day third Thunder it was the Mysteries that was contained in the Seven Seals he was now interpreting the symbology and telling you the mystery that l behind that it was the revelation of the seven Thunders and it was taking place all week and he's saying it's going on all around you and you're not getting it what was going on all around them the revelation of the seven Thunders was coming forth now it's marking the end time the mighty Angel has descended the lamb has taken the book and now the revelation of the seven Thunders is showing you he opened the seven seal and he's he's just waiting for somebody stand up in her seat and say I see it brother bam if I was if I could go back there now with what I have now I'd be standing up and saying I see it brother bam I see what you're talking about this is this is what you were saying and is this the sign of the end s this is what you were talking about it's happening right now praise God he wanted them to see it so bad all week but then he comes to the last day and he's resolved now you're not supposed to see it then he comes to the seventh seal says I feel to stop say no more now remember the baby shoe and remember Sabino Canyon and remember Junior Jackson's dream and he starts tying all this together then he's telling you now it's not broke it's not it's not permitted to be broke yet and it won't be broke to the public now it won't it won't be it's not it will be revealed if you don't know it then it's not revealed till the time it's supposed to be revealed once you see it you go back and see exactly what the prophet's saying before then I would read what he's saying and I'm scratching my head what I don't know I don't understand but once the Revelation comes you go back and I see exactly what the prophet of God is doing amen he knew that it had to come by Revelation and it was going to take time and that's why he said don't add no interpretation don't try because it's so simple if you tried you would mess it up amen yes yes so now he says when he opened that seventh seal it's a hidden mystery no one knowed it right along with that he said no one would know his coming and also they wouldn't know about the seven Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together the seventh seal now when they get when that gets on tape which it is that'll probably send 10,000 of my friends away from me cuz they're going to say brother bandam trying to put himself and make himself a servant or a prophet or something before God let me tell you my brethren that's an error I'm only telling you what I seen and what has been told to me and now you do whatever you want to I don't know who's going or what's going to take place I do not know I just know that those seven Thunders holds the mystery that Heavens was quieted amen what's that the seventh seal everybody understand amen questions and answers 1964 this is August 1964 over a year later have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet he said no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make it out was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seventh my the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed yeah the seventh angel who's the seventh angel and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seven Church AIDS which is William brandham which is also the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 Amen in that day yes sir amen the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed amen they're not going to be revealed later they're going to be revealed under his ministry amen then he and then comes to the leoan church age out of the church age book he says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things according to Malachi 4 he will turn turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers what what does that mean that means the seventh angel the Elijah of Malachi 4 amen has to be the one who brings the revelation of the seven Thunders amen not another man not anybody else it has to happen in his ministry under his sounding he's got to bring the revelation of the seven Thunders and if you don't have the revelation of the seven Thunders you don't have the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 he can't be Malachi 4 without the opening of The Seven seal he can't be Malachi 4 without the coming of the Lord he can't be Malachi 4 without the revelation of the seven Thunders because it takes these revealed mystery truths to literally fulfill Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers so you can't have brother banham as Malachi 4 and not have him amen as the one who reveals the seven Thunders amen it doesn't work if he did not in his sounding reveal the seven Thunders then he did not fulfill Malachi 4 so if the Seven Seals not open he wasn't who he said he was and who we believe he is if Christ hasn't come he's not who he says he is and not who we believe he is amen so it's we we've come to the place in the message it's all the way or nothing amen it's either right or it's not right we can't hang up halfway anymore he's either who we believe he is and who he says he is and who God Vindicated him to be or we need to go start something else because you can't mix this with your own thinking anymore it's got to be the Fulfillment of the word amen still tons of things we don't understand all kinds of questions I got I I I I agree there's still things that he's got to unfold things I don't understand things he said I don't comprehend but that doesn't change anything he has got to be the seventh angel that's on Earth at the time of this coming when the mighty Angel comes down with an open book in his hand and the Seven Thunders are revealed which reveals the mysteries of the Seven Seals that's the time he has to be here and then it has to be finished when he's here so we're not adding anything to to it we don't have to add anything to it all we have to do is ask God to open our eyes to see it amen and once we see it if I could just add this once we see it just because we describe it with other scriptures and brother Brenham described it with and we use other types and shadows than what he used doesn't mean we're adding to the message right sometimes there's a there's a ality that can be only say what the prophet says amen only say what the tape say so that means I can only quote exactly what brother BM said that's the only way I can preach that's the only way that I can explain anything so that means that all I could do is stand up here and read list of quotes I can't say anything else but what he's saying is say what the tapes say what are the tapes saying listen you can quote the tape and not say what the tape's saying just like you can quote the scriptures and not say what the scriptures are saying it's not verbatim reading it's a catching the revelation of what's on the tape and then you can go anywhere in the scripture because the opening of The Seven seal opens your understanding it opens up the entire Bible brother Brandon's Bible became a new book your and my Bible should become a new book we should see the seven seal the coming of the lord The Mystery of the Thunders the great mystery of the mystery of God we should find it everywhere in every crack in every crevice places that brother B didn't have time to go he wasn't on Earth that long after the opening of the seals his Bible became a new book and he had less than 3 years to preach but now we've had 60 some years to preach the message we should still be finding it new places all through the Bible and we should be saying what the tapes say Amen by catching the revelation of the word and coming amen with the same Revelation he had now I see what he sees and I didn't get it from a textbook because he didn't get a textbook I got it from a revelation of God in my heart and now all I'm trying to do is what he was trying to do I'm trying the best I can to use the best means possible to explain to you the Revelation that's in my heart and when we stumble on our words yes will we use a scripture in a way that you don't think we should use it absolutely we'll do everything the prophet did when he tried to describe the revelation will we say things that sound odd will we stumble over our words will we misquote and mismanage even characters in The Bible absolutely that's not the point the point is what is the tape [Applause] saying God then say what the tape says and use any means possible to explain it but say what the tape says amen praise be to [Music] God I hope that doesn't scare you but it Thrills me amen when a brother comes to the pulpit inspired he's got the vision and he goes to a scripture I never thought of and he uses it in a way I never imagined and he pulls the seven seal out of that my heart just soaring saying praise God I'm not saying you can't do that who says he can't do that he can do it amen why because he's saying what the tape says he caught the revelation of what what the prophet was trying to bring to us he said he says I hope you're catching what the spirit's been trying to get over without coming right out and saying it if he didn't come right out and say it how am I going to only say what's on the tapes to say what he wants us to catch but didn't come right out and say Amen you've given us an impossible task and brother R says you've got to read between the lines it's a love letter you catch it between the lines you have your Bibles open if you don't open your Bible open it anywhere don't turn to any Scripture just open your Bible right to the middle somewhere look down at your Bible and look between the lines what do you see between the line it's white you're looking at the white stone friend you're looking at the unwritten portion of the word you're looking what's in between the lines The Love Letter that's given to his bride he he put it between the lines and she knows it because she has a love relationship with him because she was part of him before the foundation of the world and through this Revelation she's reconnected with him in love with him the Capstone is love and now she's coming down and she can read what's in white what's not written at all she can read it and she can see it praise be to God we're reading the white stone all the time friends there's a great mystery that's has been veiled in this Bible that he's waited for this end time to bring and why did he do it because he wants us to rise above all the things of the world and be spiritually minded amen there's no way I'm going to finish but praise God we'll get back to it brother B says and this day the scripture is fulfilled said the next morning at 10:00 sitting there in the room about 10:00 the angel of the Lord came down he said go to Tucson you'll be Northeast of Tucson and there'll be come seven angels in a cluster that will shake the whole Earth around you said it'll be told you from there how many remembers that here way before it happened there is men sitting right here in this building tonight was standing right there when it happened and said the Seven Seals of the Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible will be opened and fulfill revelation 10 that in the seventh Angel's message these things should come to pass this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes this day this scripture is [Music] fulfilled praise God brother M says the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals and when those Seven Seals opened that that opened up the entire Bible the Seven Seals it was sealed with seven Mysteries and in those Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it and it was a book of redemption New Testament that opened up the entire Revelation now look at this now the hidden mystery of Christ was fully revealed in the Seven Seals and remember Christ is is the mystery of God revealed what's Revelation 10:7 the mystery of God should be finished Christ is the mystery of God revealed and the and now the hidden mysteries of Christ was fully revealed in the Seven Seals listen why do we need somebody else to come and do something else if Christ was fully revealed if the mystery of the whole Bible was open if the entire Bible was open what do we need somebody else to to come and do something else for to open up more of the Bible what part of the Bible's not been opened you open up the entire Bible to reveal Christ what part of Christ hasn't been revealed it was finished this is the end time shall be no more the finishing of everything we're in we're in the end time everything is ending amen praise be to God and that Capstone when he said turn it to the right that Capstone we found out was The Headstone it was Christ amen coming to unite with his bride Christ in what way Christ the full revelation of the mystery of Christ the headship our bridegroom our husband the revealed word was coming to unite with his bride to become one that's what was taking place at the sounding of the seven Thunders look at this look here at the date on this message the contest 1962 1231 this is the watch Night Service this is the next day after he preached sir is this the time or is this the sign of the anwers he says we are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you for 1963 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence in our life and in our being help us God forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up Mighty Warriors of the faith open this year Lord that hidden Mana that rock beneath the rock what's he talking about what's he talk what's the rock beneath the rock the night before he preached CES the time and talked about Junior Jackson's dream everybody in the room knew what he was talking about and he's saying he's coming at the watch Night Service at the end of 1962 and he's praying to God for the coming year and he said oh open this year when in 1963 Open Lord the hidden Mana that rock beneath the rock what's the hidden Mana it's the revelation of the mystery of God which is Christ amen the revelation of Christ the rock beneath the rock listen that we might see the program of God what was the whole purpose so that you would understand God's whole program of Redemption where you come from how you got here what he's doing what he's been doing for the last seven Church what Christ came to do what you're here to do what he's going to finish up and how we're going to move on from here that we might see your program that's what he was hoping to be accomplished in 1963 and he would open this year Lord the hidden Mana that rock beneath the rock the white the revelation of the white stone that we might see the program of God right you realized the preaching of the seven Thunders was to bring the correct interpretation of the symbols of the seals not so that we would fixate on the symbols of seal there's Great Value in that amen but so that we would recognize the time marker that this is the seventh seal this is the coming of the Lord amen this is the uniting of the head and the body that we would recognize that the seven Thunders would bring us to the end time amen so that we would see the program of God now that's why these Mysteries loged the Seven Seals unlock the whole Bible because it unlocks everything once you know amen what God is doing and how he's doing it and how he's accomplishing what what was the great mystery of God the great mystery of God was Christ Christ is what the anointed word what anointed word it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in David it was Christ in Abraham it was Christ in Paul it was Christ in Peter and it's Christ in you and it's Christ in me that's his program that's the Great mystery that he wanted to reveal underneath these seals that's the White Rock that's the mystery of this book this book is all about God and all about Jesus Christ and all about Redemption amen but brother brandom come along and he began to preach amen and show us why it had to be blood why virgin birth what happened in the garden the mystery within the mystery why because his redeemed seed were on Earth and now he goes from predestination which others preach predestination that you were predestinated and he preached predestination the denomination's perspective was God looked out and he knew you would choose him he predestinated You by for knowledge amen that's God's predestination brother brandom come with the mystery Under The Rock and he says he predestinated you because you were in him in his mind before the foundation of the world it took it from the surface down to the depths of the mystery of the back of God's mind light had never shined on this before nobody else preached about a seed Gene [Applause] amen and the seed Gene brought the need for Redemption the seed Gene brought the need for the Holy Ghost the seed Gene amen needed the needed the New Birth the seed gen was predestinated amen open to us this year the hidden Mana that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of God and then look where he goes to next cap off the Pyramid of our life Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessing be upon us all this is what brother brennam was hoping for in 1963 this is what God accomplished in 1963 and the last part is what he's accomplishing today amen the stature of a perfect man adoption bringing Sons and Daughters by the opening of the word into an adoption condition and what is an adoption condition oh praise God Almighty help me Lord we look at an adoption condition from an Earthly perspective and we say oh I'm lost and I'm Wayward and I want to be in the right position I want somebody to lift me up and connect me to God and we look at this adoption and we want God to pick us up and put us in a up on a pedestal and give us rights and privileges and honor and glory amen but adoption from God's perspective is totally different cuz remember God adoption was God's predestinated plan it was the mystery of his will remember we've been preaching on the mystery of his will that we would be adopted amen that he predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ unto the good pleasure of his will so what was his predestinated plan to adopt us why did he want to adopt us because his desire was for himself to be made flesh on the earth and his children that's God's perspective on adoption adoption is to bring you to maturity so he can put the signant ring on you amen so he can give you the checkbook so you can be almost equal to your father so he can have a son that he can turn over the Millennium to Jesus Christ came to that place now Christ's bride has to come to that place so that he can turn over in adoption the whole creation to his son and his son's wife and God can go take his Millennial rest adoption is so much deeper than what we think adoption is it's God fulfilling his purpose his desire what he wanted what did God always want and what was robbed from him in the Garden of Eden he want an earth inhabited with sons and daughters of God that he could fellowship with and that would display his attributes in this manifestation adoption will bring that back amen so what are we going to what are the Seals supposed to do what's going to happen in 1963 open up this coming year the hidden Mana the secret portion of the bread the word Christ the hidden Mana the rock beneath the rock the hidden revelation that we might see the program of God and then cap off our lives adoption Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus the headship the word upon each and every one of us that's what was supposed to be accomplished in 1963 I say God let it be accomplished in 2024 cap off our lives and put on us the Capstone of Jesus Christ that we might come into His very image and be him upon this Earth for his glory and let's all stand we're going to have to finish this some other time amen musicians if you could come and brother John if you make your way up let's just bow our head and pray dear heavenly father we thank you for this day God it seems almost impossible that human lips could speak of such things it's overwhelming when we stop and really think and consider Lord the mystery that's been veiled before the foundation of the world your mystery of yourself that was hidden inside you God you've brought it to us and by your grace you've quickened it to us we could never see it intellectually we can never come to it by study it's only possible because you predestinated us to it and you've drawn us yes God we can say in ourselves we're not worthy we're not worthy of this honor to even see these things we're not worthy father to be a partaker but oh we're so thankful that you chose us in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world God I pray that you'd help us to put the right value on these Revelations that it are it's more than life it's beyond life it's beyond any tangible thing that we can lay our hands to and may God may we put the right value to this Revelation may become the greatest thing in our whole life for God this is
