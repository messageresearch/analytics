had heard she could believe and in her journey there were dangers along the way but she had to see this man and hear what he had to say so even though the way was rough and hard Lord the day finally came for her prayer card and when she stood before the king he told her everything that was in her heart and more through him her face was restored she gave all her gifts to him to this great King Solomon her desire was fulfilled when her heart he did reveal [Music] foreign and in our day a man came on the sea with a gift of discernment and prophecy but he did not point to himself he pointed to Christ for he said in him you have eternal life my whole Bible's been open and I see Christ that sealed books been loosed by names inside and now I know about the mystery of my life life that I was placed here in this age and one I was a thought of God before the dawn of time before Genesis 1 1 I was in his mind and then one day his thought of me came forth I bypassed my theophany and came to Earth foreign [Music] [Music] again and there's a queen rising up up again singing There's a greater than Solomon that is here amongst us for now he dwells in a peace [Music] she surrenders her life

say my name we bow before your face [Music] man let's look at Genesis chapter 2. verse 8. and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground may the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the side and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen God bless you as you take your seats you know we find everything begins in Genesis we talked about this last week and my brother Branham said that we believed it you know like everything else he says we believe it but the realization of it keeps sinking in deeper and deeper of what this word is and what God's mind is on it and how God is continually unfolding himself through the word and last Sunday I took a title two trees in Eden I believe that was the title something like that and this morning I'd like to take for a title two trees in the garden we want to write that down two trees in Eden and two trees in the garden and uh and so we know that God had created Eden and Eden means pleasure this was God's pleasure it was his desire but then within Eden within his desire within pleasure he had planted a garden and in that Garden he would place his son and eventually his son's wife would come from within him and come into manifestation and they would be there and God would have fellowship with them but in that Garden in his garden in his pleasure within his pleasure he had a garden So within Eden he had a garden and within that Garden he was going to place his son and his son's bride but within there he also placed two trees the tree of life and we know the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which brings death which is the tree of death so it's the tree of life and the tree of death were in God's Garden and in in verse 16 we go on to set read here and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but if the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so that's how we know it is a tree of death because the result of taking this tree is death now if we look at the word Garden that's used in here we've read it several times in the in the couple passages we read in the in the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden this word Garden uh is the word an I don't know if I pronounced that right but g-a-n is what it shows in the concordance it's a Hebrew word and it means Garden or enclosure an enclosed garden and and also the definition that's in the concordance when you look at this is taken from Strong's Concordance you have the definition one Garden enclosure one a enclosed Garden one a one it says figurative of a bride figurative of a bride and so this is most easily seen in Song of Solomon so if you'll turn with me to Song of Solomon we want to read from chapter 4. Psalm of Solomon Chapter 4 and I'm going to begin reading from verse 12. chapter 4 verse 12. this is a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed so here we know that Song of Solomon is a love story between the bridegroom and the bride and he's calling her a garden enclosed well the word Garden means an enclosure or something that is enclosed or protected and then this is a garden enclosed and this word enclosed is is a stronger meaning it means barred or locked so not only is it uh in in the garden is protected but it's also locked and sealed this is this is showing the virginity and the purity of the Bride but also that God has walled her and God has sealed her the garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant fruits campfire and spikener and Spike nerd and saffron and plumbus and cinnamon with all trees of Frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices a fountain of gardens a well of Living Waters and streams from Lebanon now the bride speaks in verse 16 so the bridegroom speaking and he's describing the bride she is a she's a Walled Garden she is a a separated garden and she's barred and she's sealed then he starts to to talk about all the the fruits that are in her all the fragrances that are within her and then she speaks and says awake o North Wind and Come Thou South blow upon my garden that the spices thereof May flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits chapter 5 verse 1 the bridegroom now speaks and says I am come into my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my myrrh with my spices I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey I've drunk my wine with my milk eat oh friends drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved so here you have this whole imagery of the garden again so it's amazing how much the garden shows up in the Bible in the beginning there was Eden and God planted a garden Eastern and Eden so it's a special place within Eden that's enclosed and and we know brother Benham said that the devil slipped under the gate he climbed over the wall so we know that this Garden was this Garden was protected and we know that she was protected by the word and so now uh uh we have a garden in the beginning it's amazing that we have a garden that now the bride is described as a garden and a garden is figurative of the Bride figurative language of the Bride As Seen in song of Solomons and now the bride she's enclosed in the word and she's been sealed amen but there's one who gets admittance into the garden amen into the secret amen I remember as a boy I read The Secret Garden well this is the secret garden that one gets to have access to because she's barred and she's sealed amen and that one is the bridegroom and she's inviting the bridegroom to come into the garden she wants all of uh that he wants her and he and he and he put within her amen so much is within her that he desires and is desirable to him and now she's calling for the north within the South to blow amen that the fragrance of the spices amen which he planted in her will come out and he's inviting she's inviting him into her garden Amen to partake of his pleasure his desire amen so all of this is so figurative and it's amazing that that Jesus surrenders in the garden Gardner Gethsemane and Jesus is buried in a garden and he resurrects in a garden and and he's supposed to be the gardener amen all of these things are not in vain but he is the great Gardener and he is the one who's planted a garden and he sealed that garden and he's the one that has access to the garden so so when God initially in the beginning of our bible plan in a garden Eastward in Eden and in that Garden there was two trees and we begin to to think about you know I thought so many times on why two trees you know and we've talked so many times about if we had it to do and it was my children would would you put those two trees there and I could say in my human mind and my human self I wouldn't I wouldn't put the tree of knowledge and good and evil there I would I would I would not even allow it to exist but that wasn't what God wanted there was another purpose to all of this and God in his great understanding his great mind in order to be expressed and for the benefit of all the attributes he had to allow things to go a certain way so that there would be an understanding that there would be a knowledge and a protection because you know the God had put them in a garden and he put them behind the wall of the word but the but the devil found a way under the gate over the wall through the door however you want brother bam uses all those terms right but really what happened is is the woman opened the door she she allowed him access he said she stuck her neck out from behind the wall they stepped out from behind the wall he uses all of these Expressions to let you know that though God had a wall amen God's children were able to to open the door to to to go around the wall amen so God it's not always that God is always going to shelter and protect because he knows amen you can't always be sheltered and protected sometimes he'll he'll let you taste of that bad fruit so that you know the consequences of coming out from behind the wall so now he can put a wall in place that he doesn't have to trap you in but he can put a wall in place that you will willingly stay behind that's kind of the purpose of the whole Bible it's kind of the purpose of the fall and all of these things is that so there was a deception that fell in heaven and and the Angels were deceived and many of them and they fell when Lucifer found you would think we talked about this that heaven was a safe place but heaven was a dangerous place and you would think that nearer to God you got the safer it was but nearer to God was a dangerous place because that's where Lucifer was he was a covering cherub and so and he was perfect in Beauty perfect in wisdom full of beauty he was made marvelous he was made Splendid and God made him that way and Michael was also uh uh made by God he was also expressing something and brother bear said he was expressing the kingdom of Christ the kingdom of Michael and he says that Lucifer thought he could build a better Kingdom than Michael's humble Kingdom so in heaven you had one that was considered a humble Kingdom and you had one that was Splendid and marvelous and spectacular so you had two in heaven amen and and there was Angels who made a choice and they were deceived by following the one and not the other but you know if God had word on Earth he had his word in heaven so they had to leave the word they had to be deceived on some part of the word in order to fall amen and then they fell and now now God is putting his attribute his own son Amen in the garden on Earth and and he knows that the Lucifer is I said at large if we could say it that way and his nature is not going to change his tactics aren't going to change he he wants to he wants to circumvent God's plan he wants to rise higher than God himself amen and he's still there and and it's amazing at the fall in heaven why didn't God just annihilate Lucifer I Can't Tell You Why more likely than not he's restrained by his own law in some way there's a plan that has to unfold it serves God's purpose why or how I don't know but God is always working according to his word his nature never changes he doesn't change he's just and he's righteous and he's holy he's a vengeful God he's a merciful god and is is he's never changing so why he didn't annihilate him I don't know probably had something to do with a restraint in his word that's just brother Chad I don't know but we know it serves his purpose we know that undoubtedly and so he knew that he would come into the garden and and there was two trees there was a choice there was free moral agency and they could choose between the two and they were in close proximity to one another they were in the midst of the garden amen and and they they could have been touching their limbs could have grown into one another I don't know how close they were but it was pretty close in heaven so now it's pretty close on Earth in God's garden and and now when when the woman was deceived and the servant began to speak to her she began to analyze the tree and in her analysis of the trees she couldn't find anything wrong with it it was pleasant to the eye good for food a tree to be desired to make one life she couldn't find the problem and the problem wasn't apparent in the tree the problem was hidden in the tree it was a product of eating the fruit it wasn't apparent inside amen but it became obvious after partaking and that's the thing with God's word what's different than our human reasoning is sometimes in our reasoning and understanding we can't see what's wrong with a certain thing amen from the word of God but it doesn't matter whether we can find the wrong or the error in it or not amen the problem becomes evident sometimes after we've partaken so God has placed them on freedom World agency he's given them a choice in the garden and they can choose to partake of these two trees and and the woman being deceived she partakes of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil becomes a tree of death and she herself becomes a tree of death and the fruit that comes from her is destined for death we are born dead because she took of that fruit and she became a tree of death and so now we we see that there was two in heaven there was I say light and darkness Good and Evil two on Earth in God's Garden and the garden Eastward in Eden tree of life and a tree of death light and dark but now we are God's Garden the bride is his garden and I think if you'll look with me you'll realize there's two trees in this Garden we talked Sunday about how close deception is it may be closer than we realize we always want to put deception in the Catholic Church we may even want to put perception deception in the pulpit but deception lies within us Lucifer was deceived by his own brightness so where did Lucifer's Deception come from it came from within him he deceived himself by his own wisdom his own brightness his own wisdom his own Beauty his own greatness and he was self-deceived there was nobody else deceiving Lucifer Lucifer deceived himself and we realized now that in his garden in this Earthly existence that we walk in there are two trees there's light and dark there's good and evil it's become a tree of Good and Evil let's go to Romans chapter 7. take a look at some scripture Romans chapter 7 look at verse 14. this is the Apostle Paul ministering to the Romans in chapter 7. verse 14. for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal so to understand for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I if then I do that which I would not I can send unto the law that it is good now then there's no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find none for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me I find that a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members worrying against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members o Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin yeah the Apostle Paul is saying a lot and we've experienced what he's speaking of and in 1964 there was a questions and answers in August that brother Brandon was doing and he gets this question and and has somebody quote a portion of the scripture that we just read they quote and we say that we know the law spiritual but I'm carnal Soul under sin for that which I would not uh I would do not for what I would that I would not but what I hate I do if then I do that which I would not I can send unto the law that it is good now then there's no more I that do do with it but sin that dwelleth in me this I cannot understand this is somebody's question they quote the scripture and behind it said this I cannot understand it's hard to comprehend sometimes but then this is Brother branham's answer say well they wrote out the scripture that's Paul speaking to the Romans now he said just me kinda just kind of Polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons this is Brother Venom's answer he's explaining the scripture he said let's just let me read it again he said let me just kind of Polish it up so you can see so he's going to rephrase it he said in me as two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do and every time I start to do right then wrong hinders me amen brother says you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith and this Faith disagrees with all six senses if the sixth senses doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the six senses agree with faith wonderful but when the senses six senses disagree with faith then leave the six senses alone now for instance here Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man now that's the same thing that Paul's speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have the troubles we do of married four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are a spirit Man soul inside that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God Said how can I take a cocklebur and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from cochleberry wheat a Cocker board to a germ called wheat life so now he's trying to get us to understand Romans 7. don't lose sight of this the condition that we're in he said how can I take Cocker and make it a weed I can't I'd have to transmit the life of wheat into the inside of the cocoa bird that's what he's saying okay and in the Conqueror to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cuckoo bird and it'll produce grain of wheat that's right because it's wheat life on the inside because there has been a life of wheat put in the cocoa bar and the life of the Cockapoo has been taken out but the nature of the cockover is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again so he's talking about the change in the body so the outside until until the this body is changed on the outside it's going to be a wheat life inside a of bird plant right making it by Nature on the inside wheat and by Nature on the outside cockle burn all right he's trying to explain Romans 7. when it comes forth then it's no more cockable but wheat but while it's here on Earth and in the out of the earth and the Cocker bar it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again how many loves the message this is our struggle this is our battle it's a battle between the kookabur nature and the wheat nature the life on the inside and what's the residual effect of hybridization on the outside of us in our mind in our spirit realm and in our flesh amen but inside has been born Anew there's a new creation Now there's a genuine sieging a genuine wheat germ on the inside so you are wheat amen but your wheat trapped in cocklebur and until it goes into the ground and rots and comes forth again then it'll produce exactly what was on the inside all the way around so until the resurrection and change of the body then we're dealing with this wheat inside cocoa Brewer outside that's why I say in God's Garden are two trees you can say what would what would I have done in Eden what would I have done in that Garden that day you're in the Garden today your brother said so you're back in the garden you're facing those two trees and you're not standing and saying do I receive the message or do I receive the Baptist I think deception's closer than that again questions and answers in the same message further down he says this is a dying spirit and a dying body he's talking about your human spirit but you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two Natures in you at one time I love so much what God has showed us through this message talk about a confused people a man trying to live for God and trying to live the word and having a stickle cocky sticky cockle burn nature with the residual effects of genetics and the hybridization and not even knowing that you were hybrid from the Garden of Eden not even knowing what the fall was all about and now I'm not even understanding new birth in the right way and thinking that the baptism Holy Ghost will change everything and I'll live a perfect life and never have a struggle again I am so glad we've been freed from denominational ideas to come to the reality of God in this day God has a garden amen he's planted a garden and you're the garden and and you've been shut up and sealed behind the word and sealed under those seals all this time you've been barred behind the seals but he loosed the seals so that he can open the way to the garden and the garden is saying come now blow let the fragrance of what he's put in me come back to what's in you the word amen and the word is attracting the word and the word is coming to the word but we want only the bridegroom to come into the garden we don't want another hybridization we don't want another serpent something that's like human but not human something that's like the bridegroom but not the bridegroom because our bridegroom is riding on a white horse the false bridegroom is riding on a white horse we see him in Revelation 19 riding on a white horse but we see in Revelation chapter 6 amen the Antichrist Spirit riding on a white horse amen we want the bridegroom in the garden but we don't want the other white horse rider in the garden praise God let's look at First Corinthians 6 19. First Corinthians 6 19. it says what know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and neither not your own what's in you God what's in you hybridization and a carnal nature at the same time yeah well brother remember preached the message called Israel in the church back in 1953 I love this message but this quote comes from there it says watch it's moving right out today in a terrible force all around it behooves you my brother sister to consider what you're listening at and don't you never underestimate Satan's power for deceiving don't you never underestimate him he's smooth as can as he can be and the Antichrist Spirit isn't communism no the Antichrist spirit is so close like the real thing to little deceive the very elect if possible Jesus said so in Matthew 24 it's a religious spirit oh I want you to catch that that Antichrist spirit is a religious spirit oh why Cain and Abel were brothers The Crow and the dove set on the same Roost Esau and Jacob were brothers Judas and Jesus was in the same church one the preacher the other one the treasure see there always just the deceiving the lie that came that Satan told Eve was 90 truth ninety percent truth so he's showing us that there's been twins you've told you because don't ever underestimate the power of Satan to deceive amen and then he begins to show you Esau and Jacob Cain and Abel Jesus and Judas I say Lucifer and Michael then he goes into the ark amen and he says the he said The Crow and the dove sat on the same Roost you talk about close they were in the ark and this message Christ is the ark and and there was a a dove and a crow sitting on the same Roost and I want to look at two scriptures I want to go to Jeremiah 17 9. before we go to the next section here Jeremiah 17 and 9. Jeremiah chapter 17. he's going to read one verse and then we're going to go over to Hebrews Jeremiah 17 verse 9. the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it he's talking about your heart let's go over to Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12. for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints in the morrow and as a discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart the heart is deceitfully wicked who can know it I tell you friends sometimes we don't even properly understand ourselves we don't even properly discern ourselves sometimes we sometimes deceive ourselves I don't know if it might just be me I might be the only one in the room but I look back in in my past and I see mistakes I made but the day I made them I thought I was right and I thought I had good reasoning and good intentions and I had scripture and I had and I quote and I had this reasoning in my mind and I made the decision based off reasoning amen but now I am years later looking back and now I can see things I didn't see that day but I saw my own Pride that was motivating me I saw my own desire that there was something that I wanted out of this decision there was something that would benefit me in this decision and so I allowed the reasoning to be a religious reasoning and the religious reasoning and you would have never convinced me that day I was wrong I was convinced but now I look down the down the road I look back and I know I was wrong I know there were other things laying in my desire other things in my heart that weren't just pure motive and when you do that it scares you you look at that and it's frightening how you can begin to justify your own actions religiously but but still behind it there's an element of Pride or lust a desire a selfish desire and so you know I was I was thinking about David remember David he's king of Israel God has put him in a position and and he's serving God faithfully and God allows a spirit to come to David to convince him to number the people against the word of God right so David goes in numbers of people because God had ought against the people so God needed to bring a chastisement to the people so there had to be an error so so God allowed a spirit to move upon David and David began to number the people and then it all comes out that he was wrong and he repents and and all of those things happened and God uh you know he he he I think 70 000 people die in that plague if I'm I might be mistaken but a great number and God brings a correction David cries out he repents God hears David and he stays his hand over Jerusalem but I began to think about that there there had to be something in David that that Spirit could work on there had to be an element of Pride somewhere where David wanted to know how big his arm he was or that influence would have not had anything to work with and we know God was in it all and it served a purpose but you realize how how desperately wicked the heart is the heart of mankind desperately wicked who can know it but the word the word is sharper and quicker than any two-edges sword dividing between the soul and the spirit you talk about the hardest division to make you try to determine whether that's you or God in your own thoughts you try to determine in your own desires and your own thoughts and wanting to take an action on something you tried to discern which is you and which is God and you'll find out that that soul and that Spirit are pretty tight but what can divide it the word of God if David would have only looked at the word and God said don't number the people amen he would have discerned his own Thinking by the word so the heart of man is deceitfully wicked who can know it but the word can separate it out that's why if it wasn't for the message of the hour We're hopeless folks we're finished I mean you would say without the message you know I I've I've said before myself without the message I wouldn't know where to go without the message where would you go you go live by yourself but listen if you live by yourself you still have a problem and the problem is yourself there's two trees in this Garden you can't go off and live a Hermit life and expect to overcome you still have to face those two trees every day and the deception that's coming from your own heart there's no getting out of this we all have to go through it we all have to face it and we don't have to learn how to surrender to the word of God we we thought it was going to be easy I mean I thought it was going to be hard at first because I mean I have to leave my church I've got to get baptized in Jesus name I have to be rejected my wife has to change the way she dresses not cut her hair I've got to change some of my the things I think about and look at and talk about and that was really hard changes and we made those changes but I realized that was nothing that was a piece of cake compared to what God is requiring in this day he wants a pure heart he wants a full surrender and he wants preeminence in you and I thought well that'd be easy God you can have for him and his but he doesn't take he only receives what's given what's yielded to him God Only Takes as much as he yielded to him amen and I realized so many times in my life I think I'm giving all but I'm still holding on to something I'm holding on to a thought or a desire or a plan or a wish amen and I think I've surrendered all and then years later I realized I haven't surrendered all and now I Surrender another little piece and now I said I've surrendered all but when you go down the road you realize you haven't yet surrendered all it's it's not easy I don't think it was meant to be easy I think we get to a place where we don't even trust ourselves why does God allow us sometimes to make blunders and you wish God you could have stopped me why didn't you stop me you could have given me a dream you could have had somebody say something to me but God allows you to walk right into a mess a mistake your own selfish desire leading you the wrong way you make a wrong choice and you suffer the consequences and you ask why but I think that's the point it's so that we learn not to trust ourselves not to trust their own desires not to trust our own wishes our own thoughts till we get to the way we only trust one thing and that's the word and then even then if God doesn't reveal it to us in his Purity we'll never understand it with a carnal mind so the only thing we have is the word but we can only receive the word by by Revelation and that's the only way to keep it right is by God to divinely reveal it to us and so we're in a position where we need God every second of the day brother Branham said again in 1953 he said even put it back in the Ark in the destruction of the world there was The Crow and the dove sitting on the same Roost one was just as much bird as the other one was is that right but what was it one was a crow by nature and the other was a dove by nature one could fly just like the other one but their Natures their appetites were different the crow was satisfied eating the old dead carcasses and going from place to place called around he was just as happy and probably as religious as the dove thought he was but the dove couldn't stand the smell and turned back again in the ark was a crow and a dove one could eat on dead carry and the other one could not but the one that could eat on dedicarian could eat pure wheat like the dove but the dove couldn't eat the carry him and you know we can take this as the description of two types of Believers in the church or we can take it as description of two parts of me sitting on the same Roost you know I heard brother Harold Beckett say one time he said you don't have to look very far to find three types of Believers in the church Believers make Believers and unbelievers he said you are yourself your soul is the believer if you're a child of God your spirit is the make-believer and your flesh is the unbeliever well that was interesting it stuck with me for a long time I heard it quite a while ago but there's in the ark was these two birds they oh both could fly they were both Birds they both had feathers they were so similar in so many ways one could he pure grain and carrion the other could only eat pure grain listen the biggest hypocrite in the world is your own human spirit you don't have to worry about the one in the seat next to you but you got to worry about the one you're sitting inside of that is the biggest hypocrite in the world because your human Spirit can raise its hands and sing and cry and weep in the song service and can go out and commit a horrible atrocity the next day it's possible that is inside every one of us but we need something else inside that will override that and take control of that and it's the spirit of God so now we realize that these these two birds set on the same Roost and I I'm Prayed by the end of the service that we get to the point where we don't trust ourselves not one drop that I don't trust in myself I don't trust my own thinking I don't trust my feelings the only thing that I will trust is the word and God help us to see the word right in the power of transformation brother Ben says when I go home this time I'm preaching on the subject the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end this this quote just is fascinating to me I just want you to follow his train of thought for a minute he's going to go home and preach on the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and Trail him right through the Bible and show how he heads up see and you all get that on Telephone you see if the Lord permits us to do it and now just watch how cunning that fellow is how he's just exactly well well they're just like Judas and Jesus there both brothers in their tribe just like Esau and Jacob like The Crow and the dove sitting on the same roof and everything is a twin in this great Warfare that we're in foreign he's going to preach on the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end then he starts talking about twins because what are twins twins are twins are two different people that are produced from the same father and mother Esau and Jacob had the same father and mother right so they come from the same place they look like they're the same but there's something different inside Esau was not what Jacob was Jacob was predestinated Esau wasn't right so they come from the same womb and their birth at the same time so you would think they're the same thing this is how brother branham's talking about the trail of the serpent the trail of the serpent it wasn't the serpent had a trail over here and God's mind had a trail over here but those two Vines intertwined so he refers to Judas and Jesus they both came out of the same tribe they were both out of Judah he talks about Esau and Jacob and the Dove and the crow both of the bird family both can fly both can eat grain and now he's talking about these these twins now uh uh uh and he's talking about the trail of the serpent the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end and we know that there was a beast in the beginning that said that the devil incarnated and that was the serpent and he brought hybridization and we know that it'll happen again in the Pope in the end time that the devil will fully incarnate a person there's a beast in the beginning and a beast in the End Amen but but for us I don't have to look too far to find those two Vines they're wrapped around inside of me and I don't have to wait for the pope to be manifest as the Beast to recognize where the Beast is because hybridization is affecting me there's a beast in me I didn't come the way God intended me originally in the original creation there was a hybridization that took place in a mixing amen and that's affected all of mankind and it's affecting you and I so we would talk about the Beast what about the one looking you in the mirror the greatest deception is not going to come from a pamphlet that comes in the mail but the greatest deception is going to come from you yourself when you're deceived by your own Thinking by accepting something your own way and by your own desire and by your own lusts president said in the message the greatest battle ever fought he said this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on Earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles so now where is the battle the battle is not just in heaven but it came down to earth amen is not just in Eden but the battle is in human beings now the same Warfare between light and dark good and evil Michael and Lucifer Christ and Satan where is that battle taking place that battle is taking place in human beings so it fell to Earth It cast out of Heaven to the Earth fell on human beings then the battle from Angels became human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this so what God had created to be for himself Satan came to destroy what what was the bride intended to be after the resurrection of Jesus Christ when the first church came forth at Pentecost she was to be a creation for himself she was to be his bride she was to be his garden the place where he would sow his seeds and bring forth his fruit right but another one another Spirit not the Holy Spirit but the Antichrist Spirit got into God's Garden which was the first church and planted other seeds seeds of discrepancy and then two Vines took off from there so Satan is trying to destroy what God's creating for himself so what is the end time bride she is to be God's Garden restore it again she is to be the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ amen walled up and sealed up and she's she's to be inviting only one man into her garden and that's Christ which is the Living Word she's supposed to be a recipient for the word but the devil is trying constantly trying to corrupt and Destroy what God has made for himself he did it in heaven he's done in Eden he's trying to do it now like when when we read all of these things in the Bible and we hear all these things we We Begin I'm I should say we you may not do it but I I begin to place things like uh that was back in the garden and that was in heaven and then this was in Noah's day and then this was in the first church age and I I failed to realize that every age has been the same thing it's always the same whether it's in heaven in Eden or the first church day that's always the seventh there's two Vines two trees two sources amen and there's a free will to choose one or the other we are standing in the garden so we can't place things and then we also when we begin to talk about denominations and and Creeds and dogmas and blah blah blah and we start to say well that's over in that church across the street and the in the denominational church and that's in the Catholic and that's in this but listen who creates Dogma it's man human beings create Dogma where is it created in the mind of man so you can have your own Dogma right now you don't you don't have to go drive to another assembly you don't have to drive somewhere else you can sit all by yourself amen all alone and come up with your own Creed and Satan is constantly trying to get into the garden to plant another seed to bring corruption he said that's what his purpose was was to destroy destroy it then the battle begin here on Earth and begin in us that has been raging ever since so brother banham says he wants to follow the trail of the serpent the serpent the beginning of the serpent in the end and he talks about the great battle that started in heaven but where is the battle it's in US what is the fight over it's over for what God has created and reserved to be for himself that's what the devil's trying to destroy he's not trying listen he's got the world this is Satan's Eden he's got that amen he's got it all but what he's after is the garden and he he's he's got access to your mind he can't read your mind remember said he can't read your mind but he can plan a thought he can bring an influence a spirit be can we can speak to you in the spirit realm and plant thoughts that's why oh my goodness you can't trust your own thinking one thing that I find discouraging in Christianity especially among spiritual people is that they'll believe every notion or feeling that they have and they'll say it's of the Lord but it doesn't always pan out to be we've watched it we've watched it in our own life you don't have to point in anybody else you can feel definitely LED of the Lord to do something and then it falls completely apart instead of just saying well that was just me not God we say well God worked it out that way for this reason and then come on not every notion you have is the Holy Ghost not every thought I I mean at least maybe it is for you but not for me because I have a lot of thoughts that sound pretty good and when they're in my mind they're really good and I mean that's just perfect amen and when I go to share it with somebody the minute it's out of my mouth I'm like that's a really bad idea that's not right at all and then or somebody will say something or you hear preaching or listening to a table you realize that that's selfish amen that's based on Pride that that has got my advantage at its core and then you realize that you were you were deceiving yourself I think we have to be careful with the battle that's in our minds more careful than we've been in the past we think well if I associate with a group of people if I only listen to the message and only go where Believers are then I'll never be deceived listen I remember how many times I misinterpreted the message I listen Oh Brother Bear means oh awesome then I'll go to type it in a search to see where else he says it and realize I had it completely wrong my understanding was that was completely wrong he didn't say that anywhere else in fact he said the opposite everywhere else I was misunderstanding what he was saying and I thought he was tying these two scriptures together and making this and then that equals this and I got super enthused I was having a revelation but then when I go and run it out through the Bible through the message it doesn't hold out it's not true then all of a sudden I have to realize that was me I can't blame that on the Holy Spirit if not I have the Holy Spirit trying to deceive me and trying to get me to believe something incorrectly what are you saying brother Chad I'm saying the only thing we can trust is the word but it comes down to it the only thing we can trust is the word you can't trust our own Notions we can't trust our own feelings and how many times has God LED you through a notion and it was right and it was the Lord and he confirmed it with the word and it was God dropping something in your heart over and over and over how many times you got a notion or thought and it didn't prove out to be right or it led you the wrong direction you see the problem we're all in a fix because we're in this outside cocklebur with an inside wheat the word is the only thing that we can trust the problem the problem when people begin to say the Lord told me or the Lord showed me is the minute they say that for me it's hands off I can't say anything unless I see it's contrary to the word of God and then I can say well the word says this but if it's just a decision you make or an idea or something like that the medicine that I say is the Lord showed me or the Lord told me then I if that is the Lord I'm not going to be found contradicting the Lord if the Lord told you to do it then you do it but if it doesn't pan out to be from the Lord be honest and stand up and say no that was wrong that was just me like let's be truthful let's be honest let's be real let's quit pretending to be spiritual and be spiritual by receiving the word we have such a pressure to be super spiritual but the most spiritual thing in the word is to receive the revelation of God's word for this day that's spiritual the crow is just as spiritual as the dove so we have to be honest with ourselves say I only have one place to go and that's this message God gave us the word of God it's the only thing I have I can't trust myself I can't trust all my Notions all my feelings I can only trust this word and I want this word to correct all of my Notions all of my feelings everything I want to come in line with the word so Paul he he's left in a dilemma who can deliver me from this body of death he realizes the problem is in his flesh said I want to do the word I find something in me that loves the word but the problems in my flesh he's in a dilemma and brother Brenham explains it to us we said that we saw their questions and answers where he said in you is two people two peoples so he's in a dilemma but he goes on to Romans 8. I love to read Romans 8 after reading Romans 7. let's turn together the Romans 8 chapter 1. and he starts to give us the solution to our problem Romans 8 chapter 1. there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we're getting to the key now is not walking after the flesh but walking after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son and the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you that he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your Immortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you how am I going to overcome walk in the spirits receive the spirit of God and and the Brother Bear said the spirit and the word are the self-same thing to walk in the word to receive the word is to receive the spirit the life of the word and then the life of the word comes and lives its life out of you it's not a it's not a confirmation a Conformity by force it's not a Conformity by governments or by religion but it's walking in the spirit it's another life it's a life of the word that you've received coming in and living its life outside of you it's the wheat germ inside the conquerber and now the wheat germ if we focus on that it begins to flourish and bring another life so we must walk not according to the flesh not carnally but spiritually according to to the word according to Christ we must be diligent I believe in this hour to focus our attention on the right thing I I've said this before but I would like to remind you that Cardinal does not mean evil and carnal does not mean Wicked carnal means natural so there's a lot of things in natural life that we have to do you have to work you have to eat you have to sleep you have to work on your house you have to repair there's there's a there's carnal things that must be done there's a carnal life that must be lived but if we focus too much attention on the carnal we're going to deprive ourselves of the needed spiritual life that we need to walk not after the carnal not after the flash but after the spirit we need to be diligent because we're stuck so much in natural that we stick with the spirit as much as we can yield ourselves and give time and attention to the things of God brother Benham he starts to tell the story now uh I read a lot of questions and answers uh in 1964 when brother random answered the question from from Romans chapter 7 who can deliver me from this body of death I read you his answer inside use two persons and and he talks about that the wheat inside the cockle Burr immediately after that he starts talking about an Indian named chief immediately and how Chief come through a prayer line and then he couldn't say anything all he could say was me sick and he got a prayer card he said he's sick but eventually he learned more English and then he follows the story down after he tells that portion then he comes to this he said somebody told me at one time he was converted and received the Holy Ghost he's talking about this Indian man received the Holy Ghost and he said to him how are you getting along so this man met him he received the Holy Ghost and he asked him how are you getting along he said pretty good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty good and pretty bad he said well since me received the Holy Spirit he said there's been two dogs in me one of them a black dog one of them a white dog and said they argue all the time said they growl and fight at one another said the white dog wants me to do do good and black dog wants me do bad he said well Chief which one of them wins the fight he said that depends on which one she feeds the most so I think that's a good answer here so brother Branham is attaching it back to Romans chapter 7. I want you to understand and he's talking about you with a wheat inside and a up on the outside this is the context of what he's talking about I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world are the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it what's the solution follow after the spiritual things the spirit of God we we've got to be careful not to get caught caught up in the natural and forsake our spiritual life we've it it's there's there's more I should say our spiritual walk and being spiritually grounded and feeding in the spirit it's more than a daily ritual to have a ritual it's more than a religious Act like brother Ben said a a Christian praise and reads their Bible every day they have to well now that I'm reading this I realize what have to means they have to not to get the label of Christians they have to to survive they have to feed on the word they have to pray in the spirit they have to be connected to the spiritual things just to make it in this world because in them as two dogs in them is two Natures in them is cockable outside wheat on the inside which one is going to manifest itself it's the one that gets fed the most we've I mean this has been preached to him for I don't know how many times since before I was preaching that there's two dogs but when you realize it's it's it's not just a cute talking about two dogs it goes back to Romans 7 who's going to deliver me from this body of death I am trapped when I want to do good evils present with me this is this body is trapping me amen what's the solution the solution is to walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh it's not just to throw your hands in the air and say can't help it anyways I'm I'm you know carnal mind no that's not what Paul is talking about that's not what this means what it means is there is a way to overcome the way to overcome is to realize what danger you and I are in I for one have not realized the danger I posed to myself but God is highlighting through the scriptures through the message I'm realizing I am a danger to myself I need the spirit of God and I need to yield to the spirit of God because I am a danger to myself but if I walk in the spirit and not after the things of the world and not after the desires of flesh but walk in the spirit surrender to the spirit feeding on the things of the spirit I will not fulfill the lust of the flesh God has predestinated a bride that won't be deceived not because she's wiser and has better books and more searching equipment to search the message but shall not be deceived because he's predestinator not to be but because he's predestinated a bride not to be deceived in this day then what has he done to to make sure that she will not be deceived remember the Holy Spirit you say will receive the spirit but the Holy Spirit was bound in these denominational Waters for nearly 2 000 years but is loosed again in the evening time by the evening time message the holy goes back in the people so what was holding the Holy Ghost what was barring or or locking or or chaining the Holy Ghost away from the people it was Creeds and dogmas it was the church systems and so what released the full measure of the Holy Ghost to come it was the full opening of the word because the spirit and the word are the self same thing it's the life of the word it's the spirit that makes the word live so when the word was released the spirit was released so what was holding the spirit it was when denominations were holding back the word and then holding back the word they held back the spirit so when God said when Brad the prophet says to us that God will have a bride shall not be deceived like evil she's predestinated not to be then you can say well I'm predestinated not to be God didn't just say you're predestinated not to be you're going to be fine but what God did is he released the word which released the life to ensure that you would not be deceived it's not that you can just say well I can't be deceived brother you can be absolutely deceived by your own self with that attitude okay that's a wrong attitude you're taking it on the statement like the statement is the only thing that God provided to keep you from deception no the statement shows that God's going to do something in this day that's going to prevent deception of the bride and what's he going to do is give his word back to his bride so that the wall is rebuilt and she by her own free moral agency can stay behind the wall [Applause] I mean we have you have people who will take a statement like that and act like they can say do believe anything they want to believe because I'm bride and I can't be deceived that is absolutely the wrong approach to God wrong approach to the word wrong approach to that promise that's like a Jew when Christ was here saying we're God's chosen people he'll never forsake us what you're saying was true they were God's chosen people and he wasn't going to forsake them they forsook him but the promise created the wrong attitude and we have a promise in this day but don't let the promise create the wrong attitude you can't feed on the things of the world we can't just willy-nilly accept anything everybody preaches and anything that's ever said and said well I'm bride I can't be deceived no God's brought an inoculation against deception and that's the revelation of his word in this hour and and the word came in fullness bringing the fullness of the spirit to make the word live to prevent the bride from deception I must yield myself to that I must give time to that I must give my life to that you know one thing I've learned is people can say whatever they want to say but it doesn't make it so I'm Brian I can never be deceived and they go off into deception and saying it loud and boldly doesn't make it any more true saying it aggressively and with such confident that doesn't it still doesn't make it true it's only true if it was true before the foundation of the world that's what makes it true not because we say so but because he said so not because I the promise isn't true to me because I took the promise attached to myself the promise is true to me because the promise was made for me and when that happens it brings a humility it ought to bring a humility not a pride that would have us stomping off doing whatever we want but a humility to recognize I can no more save myself than anything I I can't protect my who's going to protect me from me like I've got to have another life and then the one I was born with I need another mind than the one I grew up with and was educated I need the mind of Christ I need the Life of Christ I need the word of God I need something more than me because me is not enough I will destroy myself and I will be deceived by my own human brightness and when we realize those things it makes the message at this hour become so precious and valuable to us it is a life-giving stream from God it is water from the rock it is manna every day without this we will perish in the wilderness listen friends we are in spiritual famine in this nation in this world it's absolutely black gone to apostasy there's not a stitch of food anywhere to be eaten the only places to get it out of that Barrel where Elisha blessed the widow woman amen because she served him and every day she could dip in and get a fresh portion of meal from that barrel and and it was so good every day can you imagine like when we come to church what is it when we listen to the message it's fresh meal given out from an Elisha Ministry can you imagine her and her son eating the meal that they said oh Mom this is the best we've ever had this is better than yesterday and it's like it's the same Barrel it's the same meal it's it's it's the meal which is Christ it was Christ yesterday and it was the best ever now it's the best ever why because the fresh portion of the word is always the best it's always God's portion for us it always tastes good but there is no place else to get Manna there is no place else for water there is no place else to get this Meal which is Christ and when we recognize the whole world as an apostasy the whole religious world is an apostasy and they're a spiritual famine in the land and God has given us a barrel that every time we dip in there's more meal more of Christ and more of Christ and more of Christ isn't it the same meal yes it's the same but it's new because he keeps putting more in an inexhaustible Fountain of God's word and when we realize how needy we are then we don't take our fellowship lightly we don't take preaching lightly we don't take the message lightly we don't take our Bibles violently then all of a sudden this this is the smitten rock this is the rejected Christ in our day this is where the water is Flowing from this is the meal that was ground this is my portion this is my life this is the only thing that will get me through let it let it change our attitudes and our respect and our value of the word let's look at James chapter one James chapter 1 verse 13. let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lustath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death can't blame God and you can't blame the devil who's to blame we are LED away of our own lust and enticed that's why I think it's so I think it's so I don't know what word I'm just gonna use bad so bad best descriptive word I can use when somebody will be led away of their own lust their own desire and ties tempted no sin they'll fall in sin and and in that sin they'll do a lot of damage to many people and then later they'll flip and they say well God has it all in control God allowed it for some purpose God will work good out of it all as if it's God's fault all this damage to all these people don't blame that on God that was you that was you and don't blame it on the devil you know the old saying the devil made me do it the devil didn't make you do anything the devil didn't make Eve partake of the tree she did it of her own choosing because of her own lust she wanted to know she didn't know but she wanted to know she of her own lust was enticed and she partook of sin and sin brought forth death you can't blame that on the devil you can't blame it on God you're the only one who's responsible for that if you're a child of God will he make even your mistakes work together for good absolutely will your failure even derail God's plan no it won't but that is no reason to put that on God as if it's a good thing and and neglect the damage that you've done to everybody else seen too many people do that and flipping about it and what you do is when you pin that on God you've given the people's right away to hurt and now if God did that I can't be hurt and I can't be upset now if I'm hurt or upset there's something wrong with me no there's nothing wrong with you what they did was wrong you should be hurt and they should repent for it and they should acknowledge it and they should make recompense for it and they should be sorrowful for it not flippantly say well God allowed it for some purpose everything's working together for good my goodness if it is working together for good it's the grace of God Amen the absolute pure grace of God all right I don't know but I am fed up with religion completely fed up with religion I want the reality I want the real not the statements not the not the false labels I want the reality that's all I want I've seen what religion does I grew up in religion don't want it I don't like religious rhetoric I can't stand it I want something real and I'm not saying that as if I'm saying I can't stand it over there over there I can't stand it here I can't stand it when this guy wants to get religious I hate it I want to be a real son of God completely dependent upon the spirit of God to Lead Me in the word of God to instruct me I want to walk as he is a lamp unto my feet and a light into my path and I want to step by light word by word is how I want to walk that's my greatest desire it's like a second Corinthians second Corinthians chapter 10. it says second Corinthians 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ there it is where's the greatest battle ever fought in our minds thought in the mind so what are we instructed to do the weapons of our Warfare are mighty they're not weak if we don't walk up to the flesh we don't war after the flesh that's not the problem where's the problem the problem is in our minds let's read that again for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh so this is not an outside War so I want to stop for a minute since this is where the battle is Raging started in heaven moved to Eden now it's raging in US so when God is going to have this final victory over Lucifer and the bride that final Victory will be in US the battle is in us and the Victory will be in us that's why he says the bride in the last days this end time bride amen being liberated in living his life is his victory and the reason of his death he will overcome In You and I the battle is here the victory will be here where is our Armageddon right here where do I want the white horse rider of Revelations 19 who is called the word of God I want him riding right here where's the white horse rider trying to write where's the Pale Horse trying to come to right here this is his objective amen there's a war breaking out amen but I I know through the true white horse rider is and it's Christ the word and I want him to win that final battle in me so I have to be his follower and follow after him and follow the word so it's not a fleshly battle for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations nothing fleshly there where's imaginations in your own mind casting out imaginations in every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God where does that take place in your mind and bringing into captivity every thought where does that take place in your mind where is the battle in your mind where's the devil coming he's coming to attack you in you but we must bring it to The Obedience of Christ and Christ is the Living Word we've been given something to check every thought with we've been given the word of God been restored to us to check our thoughts to check our motives to check our reasons amen and to bring all of these thoughts subject in obedience to Christ the word and say I will not accept that thought because it does not match the word I will not go that way saying I'm recognizing you in your tactics it's not it's not so much what we face out here it's what we face in here praise God let's look at uh back 1 chapter 9 9 27. oh no I'm sorry where am I I'm saying let's go to First Corinthians First Corinthians 9. sorry back one book First Corinthians chapter 9 verse 27. Paul the Apostle says here but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway the Apostle Paul had to keep his own flesh in check he knew where the battle was and he knew how to win him Proverbs 3 5 says trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not to thine own understanding I said that's good advice trust in the Lord with all our heart and lean not to thy own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy past that's what we need brother bear said in perfect strength by Perfect weakness that I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William Branham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot I don't want to get in God's way I want God to have his own way and the message proving his word brother bear says now I I to heal I cannot you know that what is a gift brother Benham something you take no it's something you know how to get yourself out of the way as long as you're there it'll never work William Branham is the greatest enemy I got but when I get him out of the way see then Jesus Christ can use the body he's not just talking about for prophetic Ministry he's talking about for you and I when we can just get out of the way how do I get out of the way when we forget our own selves when we forget our own desires our own passions our own wants and just surrender to him and and and quit worrying about who's watching or whether we get credit or what everybody else thinks that's all self that's all based on Pride anything that's all going to steer Us in the wrong direction and the message communion brother remember says like in the book here and the spot there was talking about the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon there was a grain of Life laying there that you wonder where did it come from what these strange things I was saying this taking for myself taking for myself like he was going to say William Branham well 40 years ago the William Branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William Branham he was a rank Rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham in their nature I was a sinner I come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature presidency predestinated was in there by God and in this same body see two Natures in there well I only catered to one as it growed I grewed as a baby Dada first thing you know I became a liar became everything else that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time what was it there was another William Branham was he talking about his real identification who he really is was that seed down on the inside which is a part of God which is part of the word see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things it was working then look up to the trees and think Leaf I seen you fall off last year and where are you going back there again where'd you come from what brought you here it was the eternal life working in the body now then one day as I walked on The Voice Talk don't never smoke drink or so forth and the young fellas at all and all got older and there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandon there's something calling like my little Eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah wherever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now the old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgiveness to Never Be Remembered against me no more now we stand Justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of God that's that's our story there was there was another you deep down inside the real you the one that God intended not the one that would come through hybridization but the one that was in his mind before the foundation of the world the one that he wanted to fellowship with in flesh and it was there and it's been part of you all the time but it was laying there dormant and brother Brandon even talks about times that that little that little seed would jump or or would have uh bring an emotion when you'd hear somebody preach and you would think something he said that was that seed back there then but it was waiting for the time to come to life amen and when it come under the the outpouring of the word of God Amen the spirit of God moving from his word that water hit that seed and it come to life amen and brought you back to the reality of who you really are then you look at the outside and you say I'm not the son of this and this I this isn't who I am this is only where I'm living says who I am this is only where I dwell and then we begin to separate these things out like the wheat the wheat seed inside the cockle bar and it will be that way until the body change and I realize I have got to feed the seed I have got to water the seed and I've got to cut off all nutrition from the cockle bird like the black dog and the white dog they're fighting they're at War what am I going to do amen I can no more save myself than anything I can't help myself the only thing I can do is give all the nutrition to the white dog I can and starve the black dog that's all I can do and if I do that amen the life that's in that seed will take over and do its own thing I don't have to do it listen when you talk about just take the analogy of the white dog and the black dog you don't have to make the white dog strong you don't have to make the white dog Victorious all you got to do is feed the white dog starve the black dog it's already in the dog to win it's already in the seed to win it's already in the seed to produce the word it's already in the seed to produce the Life of Christ what do you have to do keep pouring the water on keep staying in the fountain where the water is pouring out from the Fresh word of the hour strengthen be strengthened in the Inner Man and he will win the victory over the outer man there's been so much effort and so much trying and so much self-reformation and so much governments of religion amen and it never works but what works is when the life is nourished fed watered and produces its own life brother Brown says it he starts to share about his life and struggles of his life he starts talking about getting blue and feeling like nobody cares for him and he had that cockle bar outside he still had it he says he got down started feeling blue like nobody cares feeling like he hadn't done anything for the Lord and he was feeling Melancholy and depressed and he says now you know that's just you it's just you doing that brother man was he was able to separate those things and realize that's just the outside cockle burner I'm so glad that he was honest showing us that we all still have to deal with that outside cockle bird but oh the solution is on the inside the solution is in the spirit to walk in the spirit and not fulfill the lust of the flesh walking with the Lord let's turn to Ephesians chapter 3 together for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by the spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of of God let that be our life and let that be our solution man let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come you know there's no guarantee that we'll all be sitting like this all the way through to the end to the change of the body there's no guarantee that we'll go get to listen to a preacher preach it may may not I have no idea but one thing's for certain that we all need to learn how to overcome ourselves we all need to learn how to feed the white dog and not the black dog we all need to learn not to trust ourselves because we may find ourselves alone we may find our fellowship separated and what are you going to do then there will be no system no form no strength that comes from the camaraderie and fellowship of saints we better learn how to walk in the spirits and let the Lord lead us and to not trust ourselves the the biggest problem that man has had is becoming his own God it's my personal opinion I think the biggest problem mankind has had is becoming his own God believing his own Notions believing his own thoughts believing his own Revelations he ends up becoming his own God and I say thank God that he's given us something in this day to check every thought with he's given us his word which is his mind which brings his spirit and now we can walk in the spirit not partially but fully and we can surrender not partially but fully this message has become so valuable to me it is the most valuable thing in all the world to me is this word that God has restored to us take away everything I have but do not take this word from me because it is everything it is it is the water from the rock it is the Manna From Heaven it is what God has given me to keep me from deception in this hour and that word is not just print on paper that's how we read it that's how we ingest it but that word is a living reality a person that we're uniting with that if we receive him and him only and we receive the bridegroom into the garden amen and we keep the wall up and keep everything else shut up but we receive the bridegroom into the garden then the bridegroom wants to come to the garden and enjoy what's in the garden and then there's fellowship with one another and everything else is sealed out that's the relationship we're looking for today and all the world Fallen to chaos and everything's in Blackness and everything is uncertain there's a fellowship going on in the garden that's enjoyed between the bridegroom and the bride and that's what I want in this hour I'm going to yield to him and walk in the spirit and not fulfill the lust of the flesh I don't know about you but I don't trust chat nav he's the guy that always gets in the way he's the guy that creates all the problems listen I've got problems and I've created all of them myself you can't you can't control sometimes things that happen to you in life things are going to happen we live in this life there's going to be things that happen but the only thing you can control is your response to what happens and many times what we struggle with is not what happened but how we responded to it many times our problems are not coming from just what happened but what we did in response to what happened and then when we get down to the end of it we really can't blame anybody else I mean when God came to Adam Adam said the woman which thou gave me came to the woman the woman said the serpent he didn't even give the serpent an opportunity to explain this is the tendency of mankind but when we really realize listen the problem is me and I have got to surrender to this word and let him live his life in me if I'm ever going to have victory over this because now I know where the battle is the battle's here now I know where the garden is the garden is here now I know what's going on and what Satan's trying to destroy and stop it's this life coming from here and I want to yield that completely to God and for Christ to have victory in here amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your word and God as time goes on it becomes more real more personal more pertinent Lord God I don't know how to preach it and the fullness of its power and the Revelation which I received in my heart I I'm depending on you Lord to drop into everybody's heart the the desperate condition that we're in God but you made a provision in this hour and we're so thankful for that you've not left us to ourselves you've not left us to figure it out on our own but you've provided the food that we need you provided the water you provided the light you've given us everything we need to come to life and to overcome help us to stay in that Lord to respect it to give reverence and value to it Lord and let you have the place that you deserve and preeminence in US well forgive us Lord for our failures forgive us for giving to the wrong giving time and attention to the wrong things forgive us Lord help us to keep you the central theme of Our Lives the most important thing in all of our life Lord is to please you to serve you and surrender to you may that be our desire Lord God I love you and I thank you for what you're doing in this hour Lord your Prophet said as it comes Lord to the capping that it takes a lot of Shaving down he said take a lot of Shaving down for him a lot of Shaving down for us God let your word shave us down cut all the carnal away cut all the selfishness and all the pride away let us Lord be yielded to you nor may it be such a life that you live through us that we can take no credit for it whatsoever that it wouldn't be us but it would be you living in us doing what we're incapable of doing on our own oh my beloved come into your garden come in come into the garden behind the wall and enjoy Lord your place I love you father I ask that you'd help us Lord to stay guarded against the deception that's so close to stay yielded to the life that will give us freedom we love you father and we ask for your blessings over this congregation over our own lives help us to walk closer to you day by day in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I just want to share something out of scripture if that's all right before we go into communion if we could all take our Bibles and Turn the Song of Solomon I want to look at one scripture that we looked at this morning I was just meditating it was just on my heart to just look at this again and um it won't be but just a minute and then we'll go right into the communion scriptures The Song of Solomon chapter 4. verse 12 Song of Solomon chapter 4 verse 12. a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant fruits campfire with Spike nerd Spike nerd and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of Frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices a fountain of gardens a well of Living Waters and streams from Lebanon to an amazing description he has this amazing way that the bridegroom has of describing his bride and I wanted to look especially at verse 12 we talked about it this morning a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed and I I mentioned this morning I believe at least I said something about this is a it's a type of her virginity it's showing that she's been sealed she's been separated she's preserved for her bridegroom and we know that the bride has also been preserved for her bridegroom and I was meditating on this and the word Garden here we went over this morning it means an enclosure or an enclosed Garden it's also in the concordance it's figurative of a bride so this is enclosure with an E ENC if you look at the word the garden enclosed then you have enclosed Inc so these are two different enclosures an enclosure and an enclosure and it's two different words in the Hebrew uh the one is an enclosure an enclosed Garden or a garden with a wall around it but this enclosed is bar are locked or bolted so it's not just with a protective wall but it has literally been sealed it's been barred it's been locked and and God has preserved his bride for himself he has a way of preserving his bride for himself and we we talked about that and I wanted to share that in context of what we're talking about this morning and I want to read this quote out of Christ as the mystery of God revealed and this is beginning in paragraph 466. it says how do you know because you're a church member because Christ is living through you so pregnant with his spirit that you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that because you're a prisoner you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated Glory he can't take a hold the womb of life is closed to anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no world can get in oh how we'd like to stay on that for about a an hour I'm sure you understand Christ in his alone already finished the seed was there the seed was already you're talking about the the Eternal sieging of God was already in the womb of your soul the seed was there the seed was already when was it put there before the foundation of the world was predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as the life-giving flow the seedling there other seeds that just would come in wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it like but when that seed come in quickly it stopped up the womb all the rest of the seed was drove out see like that and you become a prisoner surrounded in Christ Christ in you to his life bringing forth his evidence his signs oh my look bringing his Signs of Life as evident of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that we're alive in him so I I find this passage of scripture fascinating because I had asked myself the question some time ago that brother brother Branham says so clearly that the Bride is a virgin she's a virgin to the word she's a virgin bride but we all know that we have believed wrong things in the past we all know that we were part of denominational systems part of wrong ideas then how can she be a virgin how can she be a garden enclosed and it's because no matter what you've received into the womb of your mind that's just Spirit realm but there there was a seed sealed amen sealed in the womb of your soul and it would only open to one thing and only one person is qualified to open the seal of life and that is Jesus Christ himself amen the word was laying there and only the word for your season would open the wound to allow access to the word amen and there was the word coming to the word so we have been a garden enclosed and many of us gave our bodies to vileness we gave our minds to wrong seducing spirits but God had a way of sealing something down in the soul where his garden is and nothing was going to get to that seed until he came on the scene so when he talks about the virginity of the Bride it doesn't mean that we never had a wrong thought or believed the wrong thing amen but those seeds could never take hold he said because it's different it's a different seed those seeds can't mix it can't even get to where this seed is many things come into the womb of our mind amen and we know that we can conceive there and it can drop down but it couldn't conceive and drop down because it's a different species altogether so that seed amen the seed of cat could never conceive in a dog that makes sense so it has to be rejected it can come in but it's rejected the seat of Hope can never conceive and a cow amen so there was never a conception there was never anything that broke the seal in that wound in that enclosed Garden until the bridegroom come along with the word for the day and he opened the seals and he sowed the seed and Seed came to seed word came to word life came to life and sprung forth in line it was you were a garden enclosed amen you were protected you were kept until you could come in contact with the bridegroom I am so thankful for this message I am so thankful that God had a way to bring us light in this day amen that would chase away all the confusion and the obscurity even the confusion of Our Lives brother bam said when he received the Lord he said when he broke the seals of my life he said the the book was sealed and you were sealed with the book you've been sealed all along and only the lamb can break the seals and he's the one who broke the seal and the womb of your soul amen and he planted himself there because he was already there life came to life word came to word I'm so thankful that I couldn't lock myself up tight enough to protect myself I how many times have we failed how many failures can we list but I'm so thankful that God had a garden enclosed he barred it and locked it by his predestinated will and it would only unlock to one combination and that combination is the revealed word for the hour and when that unlocked then a seed would come in that could conceive and when it conceived it drove out all other seeds everything else left your mind every other idea moved out it's been rejected it could never bring conception only this seed of this word can bring conception I'm so glad that though I wasn't doing a very good job of keeping myself virgin to the word he kept me virgin do the work uh what a consolation friends how can we not love him when he's done all of this for us how can he not serve him and give him our lives when he has done everything for us what have we done nothing brother Venom can get to come down towards the end of his life and he can be laying on with his hands behind his head in 1960 after having a a Ministry worldwide Ministry healing and deliverance and all of these things that have taken place uh uh he can lay there and say well well old boy if you're ever going to do something for the Lord you better get started and when we compare ourselves with that we think why even get started because he said he goes I wasn't the one down on the river that day I'm not the one who opened the Blind and dice I was only standing near when he didn't that's the reality friends I didn't save myself he saved me I could never be my own savior am I part of Christ yes am I part of the word yes but I could never save myself he's saved me he's my savior he's my lord it's his plan he he deserves my devotion my life my love my everything and that's what I want to give to him I was throwing my life away and he was holding me in a virgin condition in the womb of my soul he was keeping a garden enclosed and I had no idea and I was opening my spirit realm to so many seducing spirits and he was holding my virginity in his hand I thank God for that I'm so thankful I'm so thankful that he knew how to pick the lock he had the key and the key was the word for our day don't you love him I love him let's all stand and we'll read our communion scriptures and we'll go to communion with a joy and a Thanksgiving in our heart for we know who we are and we know who he is and we know who saved us we know who's redeemed us and we know whose blood was shed for us and by that Revelation he also revealed who we are and how we fit into his plan we're thankful for them [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] and while we do is good he abides with us and with all your
