========================================

Religion makes him hard to approach. &gt;&gt; We got to do all of these things to get to him. But listen, the harlot didn't have a problem. The prostitute didn't have a problem. The tax collector didn't have a problem. AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM getting to him. &gt;&gt; He didn't WANT TO BE DISTANT AND UNAPPROACHABLE. HE WANTED TO BE RIGHT THERE WITH HIS PEOPLE, HUMAN, WALKING WITH THEM, GETTING THE SAME DUST ON HIS FEET THAT THEY GOT ON THEIR FEET. &gt;&gt; EATING THE SAME DINNER THEY ATE, HE ATE. THIS IS WHAT GOD DID, FRIENDS. THIS IS THE CONDESCENDING OF GOD. SO THAT HE could be understood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that he could understand. To [snorts] me, this is what Christmas is all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tinsel and lights. I don't care BEAMS FOR IT. AMEN. BUT THE REALITY IS GOD WANTED TO COME down and be flesh. Amen. So he could redeem us. So he could die for us. So that he could MAKE CONTACT WITH US. SO THAT HE COULD BE UNDERSTOOD. SO that he could be seen. SO HE COULD BE TOUCHED. SO HE COULD BE FELT. SO THAT HE COULD BE EXPERIENCED. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We put him too far away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 2:9 says, "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All that was brother said, "All that God was, he poured into Christ." &gt;&gt; Where was he? He was right there. Listen, what's what's amazing to me is they were still going to the temple and they were still taking sacrifices and they were still praying to a god above him. &gt;&gt; And he was walking right by. &gt;&gt; There was days he visited the temple. There was times he was walking down the street. There was times he was in the outer court and there was people shuffling by. And it's amazing. I wonder if anybody ever bumped into him as they were going by and dragging their lamb. Amen. to go be sacrificed to go try to make contact with God to go be heard with God and make contact with God and they just pass God &gt;&gt; trying to do the religion trying to reach a God that's above us trying to reach a God that's far away and trying to make contact with a God who's up there and far away and so much greater than we. AMEN. LISTEN, HE IS SO much greater than we, BUT HE'S SO MUCH GREATER THAT he has enough character that he can condescend down and become low so that we can touch him. Amen. He wants to be within reach. He doesn't want to be out of reach. He wants to be within reach &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. HE WANTS TO FELLOWSHIP WITH HIS ATTRIBUTES. HE DOESN'T WANT TO SIT THE MIGHTY GOD LIKE ZEUS UP ON A GREAT THRONE SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY IN THE HEAVENS THAT you have no hope of ever getting to UNLESS YOU JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS AND AND you and you and you LIVE A PERFECT LIFE. AND IF NOT, YOU GET ZAPPED and you get sent to another demonic world and maybe you pay enough price and YOU CAN CLIMB. LISTEN, THAT'S NOT GOD. GOD DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME TO HIM. GOD CAME DOWN TO YOU. AMEN. GOD SAID, "THESE ARE MY CHILDREN, MY FAMILY, MY PEOPLE, AND MY ZEAL AND MY PASSION AND MY JEALOUSY FOR THEM WILL PRODUCE ME IN FLESH TO RUB SHOULDERS WITH THEM AND LAY DOWN NEXT TO THEM AND EAT WITH THEM AND LOVE THEM AND DIE FOR THEM." AMEN. AND REDEEM THEM AND WASH THEM SO THAT I CAN COME AND DWELL INSIDE OF THEM. THAT'S HOW CLOSE HE WANTS FELLOWSHIP. FRIENDS, &gt;&gt; it's religion that puts him far away. IT'S YOUR HUMAN MIND THAT PUTS HIM FAR AWAY. &gt;&gt; Don't put God far away. Don't do religious service and keep climbing a religious ladder trying TO GET TO GOD. YOU'LL PASS HIM &gt;&gt; because he's coming down &gt;&gt; to meet with you and I.
