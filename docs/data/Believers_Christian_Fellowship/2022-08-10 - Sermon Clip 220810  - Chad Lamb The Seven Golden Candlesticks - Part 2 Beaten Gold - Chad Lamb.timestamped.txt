[0:00] say i've been predestined to be in the
[0:02] bride absolutely and in order to be the
[0:05] right kind of bride you've been
[0:07] predestined to be conformed into his
[0:08] image in order to be conformed into his
[0:10] image whatever way he was formed is the
[0:12] way you have to be formed whatever way
[0:15] he was perfected is how you have to be
[0:16] perfected because he was represented in
[0:20] the golden candlesticks that was beaten
[0:22] gold amen praise god it was gold it was
[0:25] god but it was beaten gold and over here
[0:27] to reflect that amen over in the new
[0:29] testament we also must be made of gold
[0:32] praise god that's god but it's beaten
[0:35] gold gold that is beaten and tried and
[0:38] shaped and malleable and molded not into
[0:40] what you think you should be but molded
[0:43] into what he thinks you should be
[0:46] gold is flexible gold doesn't break amen
[0:49] gold can be moved into place amen and so
[0:52] god we have our own idea about what we
[0:55] want in life i want to be this kind of
[0:57] tradesman i want to be this kind of
[0:58] person i i want to have this kind of
[1:00] image amen but god knows how to take the
[1:03] hammer and beat you to a flexibility
[1:06] where he can mold you right back into
[1:07] what he predestinated you to be because
[1:10] you've been predestinated be conformed
[1:11] into the image of his son not your idea
[1:14] not your parents idea not the idea of
[1:16] your family not the idea of laodicea not
[1:19] the idea of guidance counselors or
[1:21] colleges but the idea that god had the
[1:23] image he had of you before the
[1:25] foundation of the world that gold that
[1:27] is inside of you that is god is
[1:29] malleable it can be molded and bent and
[1:32] flexed right into the position he wants
[1:36] and no matter how hard he hits it
[1:38] it doesn't break
[1:42] i mean
[1:43] there's you see christians
[1:46] you see christians real genuine
[1:49] christians and you read read about the
[1:51] heroes of faith and you read about those
[1:53] that come through the church ages real
[1:55] genuine the genuine believers of each
[1:57] age my goodness have you ever met a
[2:00] people so beaten so trot upon so
[2:02] downcast arrested and burned at stakes
[2:05] and ripped open and families separated
[2:07] and all kinds of problems but no matter
[2:09] how hard they were hit they could never
[2:12] kill christianity they could not take
[2:14] the life of christ because the gold
[2:16] always remains no matter how hard it's
[2:18] hit
[2:20] and you've been predestined to be
[2:22] conformed into the image of christ
[2:26] no matter how hard life hits you it
[2:29] can't break the god part of you
[2:32] it can break off stone and dross and
[2:35] debris and other kinds of metal all of
[2:37] that can go flying off of your life and
[2:39] you think i'm dying you're not dying
[2:41] you're coming to perfection amen you're
[2:43] not dying you're losing things you don't
[2:45] need
[2:48] to come right down to what you need and
[2:50] only what you need
[2:53] nothing can hit you so hard to destroy
[2:56] the god part of you
[2:58] and the god part of you is not rigid
[3:02] but malleable
[3:04] so that every time he reveals more of
[3:06] his word and plan to you he can mold you
[3:09] right into that plan
