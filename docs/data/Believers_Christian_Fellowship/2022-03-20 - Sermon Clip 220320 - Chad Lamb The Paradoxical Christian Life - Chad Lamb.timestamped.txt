[0:00] brother ben said as long as you're
[0:02] you're in this life you're going to be
[0:04] sticky and have a carnal nature that's
[0:05] going to bother you as long as you live
[0:07] but the inside of you you're born again
[0:10] so i can be born again on the inside by
[0:13] the new birth by the baptism holy ghost
[0:15] and on the outside i can still be
[0:17] troubled by an old carnal nature about
[0:19] that old sticky cockleburn nature on the
[0:21] outside that's what the prophet of god
[0:23] taught us and that's his explanation of
[0:25] romans chapter 7.
[0:28] so that we would not be deceived by the
[0:31] devil amen so that we would understand
[0:34] god has so made it clear to us that we
[0:37] won't trip over our own feet but when we
[0:39] begin to stumble around in the outer man
[0:41] we say wait a minute that's not who i am
[0:45] that's not me amen that's what this is
[0:48] the package that i came in in this line
[0:50] amen but me is the me down on the inside
[0:53] and me on the inside doesn't like that
[0:55] doesn't want
[0:56] that amen the me on the inside wants
[1:00] only the word of god believes god amen
[1:02] doesn't doubt god doesn't question his
[1:04] word has peace has love has joy has long
[1:07] suffering has all of these things so
[1:10] that you can become a paradox where on
[1:12] the outside you can have sorrow
[1:14] perplexity confusion distress even down
[1:17] but on the inside you can have a solid
[1:19] rock of faith and peace and joy that
[1:21] never passes away
[1:24] so that you become a paradox that this
[1:26] christian life is a paradox where you
[1:28] can have two opposing emotions going on
[1:30] inside of you at the exact same time
[1:32] where you can be weeping but you know
[1:34] everything's all right
[1:37] you can be afraid but you know you're
[1:39] safe
[1:43] if that's not true then who are we amen
[1:46] what are we
[1:48] you can you can i mean
[1:51] when when you get a call or you see an
[1:54] accident and you see one of your
[1:56] children fall off of something or in a
[1:58] terrible kind of accident amen you
[2:00] cannot stop the outside reaction
[2:04] there can be fear there can be
[2:05] perplexity anxiety stress and all of
[2:08] these things but there's something else
[2:10] down on the inside that knows it's going
[2:12] to be okay
[2:14] there's a faith that doesn't go away
[2:16] it's there
