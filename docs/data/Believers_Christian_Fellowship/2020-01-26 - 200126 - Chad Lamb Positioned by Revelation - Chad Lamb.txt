========================================

in us to be completely glorified i am free my day all things things are possible oh i am my are possible with god all things are possible with god oh i am free all things are possible all things are possible [Music] amen is that a living reality it can't just be words in a song but it's got to be a living reality that we know all things are possible with god amen the level of our faith should be increasing it shouldn't be going down it should be going up amen we should believe in all circumstances that god is in control and nothing's happening outside of god's will and god's plan and god's purpose and if god purposes it it's for his glory and all things are okay and there's nothing to be nervous about there's nothing to be anxious about everything's fine oh praise god you talk about a mighty invincible army you have one that's confident that nothing's out of kilter and that she's undefeatable amen that's the battle you've just won the battle right there because the battle is raging in the mind amen and we win the mind battle and understand i cannot be defeated i cannot be lost nothing will happen to me that god doesn't ordain there's nothing sent to destroy me but everything is pushing me into my position every enemy will be put under my feet by the grace of god amen how are you going to disrupt a bride like that how are you going to stop her from forward advancement you can't do it the problem is in the mind the problem is not the circumstances whatever we're facing is no problem the problem is going on between the ears and we conquer the enemy on the battleground of the mind amen if god can by his word living in us conquer this enemy then there's nothing that shall stand before you praise be to god all things are possible i love that song because i love that song because it's a positive confession i'll tell you i i'm tired of singing songs about feeling sorry for myself for suffering in this horrible world amen we're not suffering we're overcoming we're not being defeated we are defeating amen i don't want to sing about what was me and oh it's so horrible and so terrible this is wonderful amen we live in the seat of satan's eden so that we can destroy it so that god through us can destroy satan's eden what a wonderful time to be alive what a wonderful place to be praise be to god i don't want to feel sorry for myself for being here oh god help us not to be like that anymore i'm not i'm not longing amen to be rescued from a horrible condition i'm longing to come into my position so that we can have the final victory [Applause] we're free we're not hoping to be free we're free the word of god has called us free we're free we need to start believing it and believing will cause an action and an action will bring results praise be to god well god bless you amen sorry you keep standing i keep preaching but it's a good day to be alive amen let's turn to the book of exodus chapter 19 thank you musicians and while you're flipping there i got an exciting announcement to make there's been the yet the birth of another baby we have another little baby girl ilya and natasha losing off had their little baby maybe it was two and a half weeks early pretty much and she came by a surprise i was quite surprised but she's perfect she's perfectly healthy amen there was a good delivery natasha's doing well in the end the baby and and and michael are all back home doing well so keep them in prayer but she's a beautiful little girl god has certainly been good to us milana elia luzenov so we just want to thank god for the birth of this baby amen while we're standing let's look at exodus 19. exodus 19. and verse 3. and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel you have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then you shall be a peculiar a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation and they these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel let's just bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word the heavenly father we thank you lord jesus that we can be here that you've given us ears to hear and eyes to see and a desire in our heart to gather together lord to hear your word and lord we trust in your ways and we know that you'll speak to us because you said you would and god we come with faith in our hearts lord looking to your promised word and for you to fulfill and keep your word and speak to our hearts the things that we have need of in this hour i pray that you would lay the man to the side lord but you would come yourself by the power of your spirit and speak through these lips of clay through a gift lord that you've placed in this vessel you would speak words of eternal life the things that we have need of most in this hour and that we might be equipped for the battle lord that we might be given the strength to overcome by your word we ask you to take preeminence among us in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you as you're seated amen i saw brother greg bird's parents back there god bless you it's good to have you both here with us amen i i i usually lose all senses when i come out here and start preaching and i know there's visitors sometimes and i forget to even greet them last week uh natalie's parents were here for the baby dedication and her grandparents and i saw him sitting right there and right out of my mind you have to forgive me friends i i i'm there's weaknesses we're human but but praise god the word is good amen i'm so i've got such a single track mind sometimes but god is good amen sometimes my wife would even ask me over a church didn't you see so and so was there i said i saw him she was why didn't you greet him i said because i couldn't think of what their name was i know them i can say their name a hundred times in a row but when i'm standing here preaching the word that everything else is gone sometimes friends just bear with me god bless you all now you know my secret sometimes i couldn't name my children when i'm up here amen but here we see that we're in the exodus journey when we look at this scripture in exodus 19 and the the the children of israel according to a promise that was given to abraham now they are abraham's seed and the promise is the abraham seed and they're the natural which is typing the spiritual and they're being brought out of bondage amen in an exodus journey to be taken in to the land to the promised land and we know for us we're part of this third exodus being taken out of bondage of denominationalism and brought back into the land of the word amen brought back to the original word in the original intent with the original understanding and revelation and so now we're very much in this same spot and he's going to bring this people back amen and before he established the priesthood and before there was ever a king he wanted to bring them back a peculiar people a treasure unto himself a peculiar treasure a holy nation amen a kingdom of priests so it wasn't god's original order amen just to set up the priesthood and and have all these levels of intercession and things going on he wanted the people to be priests he wanted the people to be holy amen he didn't he didn't want them under the rulership of a king and we know that's part of the plan it comes later to display the attributes of christ i understand all that but just to see the type what he's wanting is he wants them all to come in with dominion and authority and power amen he wants to give them all their portion of their own land for them to take amen not to have a king to take it for them but for them to take the portion that's been given to them and when god brings us in this third exodus in this journey brings us across jordan amen through the through the third pool through the third phase crossing jordan now he wants each one of us not to depend amen on somebody else not to depend on another system but each one of ourselves amen to understand that we are in the position amen of a priest a royal priesthood a holy nation that the people amen have a connection with god that the people are a priesthood so this this morning by the grace of god i'd like to speak on position by revelation because if you don't know your position i mean that's that's detrimental when you don't know your position you don't know what to do but when you know your position now you begin to understand you know that's what's so detrimental about denominationalism and even denominational ideas even in ourselves amen so when i talk denominationalism please from now on don't you ever think baptists are methodists because we're so far beyond preaching about the woes of baptists and methodists and pentecostals and all that we're talking about the denominationalism right here we're talking about the greatest enemy i got is the one that looks me in the mirror every day the old carnal nature with the old carnal thinking and what's detrimental about denominationalism is it robs the people of their god-given position as sons and daughters of god and it puts them into a system where they need somebody else to do something for them to be able to apprehend the promises of god but that's not god's way amen in this exodus he wanted them to be a peculiar treasure and to himself a holy nation a kingdom of priests amen and when we say that you know me well enough to know we're not doing away with the five full ministry that's god's plan but the ministry is just your brother he's just your brother no different than the song leader or the songwriter or the musician or the deacon or the trustee or anybody else with the spiritual gifts of tongues or interpretation of tongues it doesn't matter amen they're just a brother but inside that brother lays a gift and that gift isn't for the brother the gift is for the assembly so there was all kinds of positions amen in this peculiar nation and they were all there to help one another so we don't ever take a gift and use a gift and a man to promote the man the man is always a brother always always brother benham said if you love me call me brother he never wanted to get and he was the prophet of the age but the prophet of the age is in office and the office is respected and honored but the man is not over over evaluated he's a brother so now we are all in this priesthood and in this peculiar nation you have some that have different jobs five full ministry song leader singer songwriter you know gifts of administration gifts of helps word of knowledge gifts with everybody has different jobs but it doesn't change the fact that it's a holy nation so the problem with denominationalism not out there in here is it robs us of our god-given position and it limits our potential it limits our potential because we start to rely on somebody else to do something for me and that's what god does not want he wants each one of us to take our position because there's a power that comes with taking our position brother branham in the message does god ever change his mind about his word from 1965 he said let us bow our heads he's praying dear lord jesus we are assembled again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of god is that what we want so i read this and i stopped there for a reason because what does brother branham want to happen with the outpouring of the quickening power of god what is he looking for what's the objective what does he want amen does he want ecstatic praise and worship does he want pandemonium to break out in the building what's he looking for with an outpouring of the quickening power of god because when we understand what brother branham when he's expecting and asking for the quickening power of god to come what does he want amen how will he know it comes what's he looking for the quickening power of god to do amen and you'll begin to see it's not what the pentecostals were asking for when they were asking for the quickening power of god they wanted to see people slain in the spirit and dance all around and and break out in ecstatic worship but that's not what brother branham was looking for with the quickening power of god to come he says with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of god to bring us into recognition of our position and place and our responsibilities [Music] are the quickening power amen of god what is the quickening power of god being poured out here today going to do it's going to show us our position and place in our responsibilities the quickening power of god is here to put us in position in recognition of our position because there's power in position amen you can you can get excited in the spirit and dance in the spirit and that's a wonderful thing amen but you can do that and not get in position and have no power and you can feel the power of god fall in a sensational way and we want those things and i like those things and i want more of those myself but just because you felt the power fall doesn't mean it put you in position for power because when the power fell and the power left if it didn't put you in recognition of your position then you now have no power operating in your life yourself then you're hoping for another amen great meeting or another something to happen for another power to pour out because you like the feeling of power pouring out but what god's trying to do is get you to recognize your position in place so that the power can flow through you not just fall on you and lift off of you and fall on you and lift off of you but fall on you to open your eyes to see your position and your place in this hour so that you move into position so that that same power now comes flowing out of you out of your belly shuffle rivers of living water so that the power is not just upon you but the power is flowing through you because you've gotten position and you're connected to the circuit praise be the god let's read this again we are assembled again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of quickness power of god to bring us into recognition of our position and place and our responsibilities as being a called people separated from the world dedicated to god grant lord tonight that the blessing of god will guide us and direct us in the things we do or say that it might bring honor and glory to your name praise be to god let's turn to revelation chapter one together so revelation chapter 1 we'll start reading from verse 4. john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you in peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the for and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests and the god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever he hath i like that word half you might know what half means already in the past finished already done half made us kings and priests into god let's turn over to revelations chapter 5. i pray that the quickening power of god comes down to so we can recognize our position and place and responsibility tonight let's look at verse 5. revelations revelation 5 5. and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne under the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth there's that same hast just like hath hast made us kings and priests and we shall reign up on the earth brother bem said in the church age book out of the revelation of jesus christ and he starts going through these same scriptures we went through revelation 1 6 and he hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen and he says he hath made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he this is all capital letters in the church he hath made us all capital with estimation points there are certain truths that need to be emphasized he hath made us you didn't make yourself anything you didn't earn it you didn't work to it you didn't go through certain levels of accomplishment and finally that you arrived he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings spiritual kings oh we're going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom that is not future tense that's this morning that's you sitting in your seat right now or a spiritual king reigning over a spiritual kingdom but denominationalism will take you from that position and have you waiting for something to happen oh in the millennium won't that be great when we rule and reign with them absolutely there's a physical manifestation coming in the millennial reign when we rule and reign in him and bodies of flesh upon this fleshly earth upon this earth but don't hey don't point me to that amen and neglect to inform me that i'm already a king and a priest and i already am a spiritual king over a spiritual kingdom i'm not waiting for something great to happen something great is happening something great has happened amen and the quickening power of god has brought me into recognition of my place my position and my responsibility i'm not hoping someday to arrive hey friends by by his grace when he arrived i arrived because i was with him amen when he overcame i overcame when he took the keys of death helen the grave i took the keys of death helen the grave because when he was here amen when he was here i was here that's what the prophet of god tells us you were in him when he was conquering you were in him when he was overcoming you were in him when he paid the penalty for sin you were in him amen when he arose and sat on the right hand of the father and you arose with him you were quickened with him and are seated now in heavenly places in christ so we point to the future there's a future there's a manifestation but that manifestation is only an earthly manifestation of what now is in the spiritual realm you have to realize so many times i've said this so much but i don't think i can overemphasize it for myself because i'm trying to break myself out of old habits but we look at the earth amen and we look at what we see and what we hear and we base everything off what we see and what we hear in this dimension our confession sometimes is off what we see in here in this dimension and feel our testimony is based on what we see and what we feel and what we hear in this dimension but this dimension is only a reflection a negative of another one that's a positive and the reality is there amen this is the sub-reality let's say it that way this is the sub-reality the negative or the reflection but we base everything our conduct our speech our reactions is all based on the negative not on the positive but by the grace of god i want to be lifted out of the negative out of the carnal so that my testimony my conduct my conversation everything is based off that pure real revelation from the eternal realm that is the reality not the reflection down here i am not basing my testimony i'm not basing my confidence my confession off the negative but i want to start basing it off the positive why because i'm already healed i'm not hoping to be healed i'm already healed i'm already saved i'm already delivered i'm already raptured hallelujah will there be a manifestation in the negative absolutely will we enjoy it absolutely but how do i know i will enjoy it because i'm enjoying it now it's too much future focus how are you going to get to the future by recognizing your position in that present too much earthly focus how are we gonna how we're gonna change things on earth you won't change them on earth oh how we've wasted so much precious time and energy trying to manipulate the circumstances around us with fleshly efforts how frustrated we become by trying to fix our problems by working harder by trying again by doing better how many times we have wasted our energy and been distracted from our real calling and purpose because we tried to fix things in the flesh and you're never going to fix things in the flesh if you want to fix something in the flesh you fix it in the spirit and when you fix it in the spirit it'll reflect fixed in the flesh [Applause] we've been too earthbound for too long amen there's a difference between chickens and eagles there's a difference the eagle was always an eagle even when it was acting like a chicken when it ate like a chicken walked like a chicken with a chicken perspective and a chicken coop amen it was still an eagle but there come a time that there had to be a quickening power of god to help that eagle recognize its position in place and then it flew above the chicken yard above the earth to gain a whole different perspective and that's when life really began for the eagle that's when everything changed that's when power for overcoming that's when deliverance that's when everything changed for the eagle is when the eagle left the earth and moved into the heavens but the chicken can't make that move they can flap a little bit they can even fly a little bit you know that a chicken can fly a little bit it's pretty pathetic they can fly a little bit and get off the ground just a little bit for just a short distance and fall back to the ground amen sometimes they can flap a little bit and get up on a roost a few feet off the ground and amen but they may feel like they're flying but that's not flying because you still haven't changed your perspective if you go from here to here you say wow i can see so much further the real perspective is going from here to there and that's what the eagles have been called to not a chicken perspective but an ego perspective which changes everything we've been so limited in our understanding so limited in what is real to us that's why sometimes we struggle so much with carnal things we struggle so much with carnal things with worldliness and and we don't know why we struggle so much and the problem is we're struggling because we're still earthbound and we're trying to fix the problem earthbound and we're not going to fix the problem earthbound we're going to have to fix it in the spirit realm first that's why you can you can beat your head against the wall trying to change bad habits trying to overcome sinful things and lustful things and wrong desires i mean you can try and try and try and you can work and work and work and you're going to end up being frustrated at the end of the day some people with a strong will may have some degree of success and overcoming but the real fix is in the spirit realm and when we lift above in the spirit realm and get above these things and the quickening power puts us in our position the earthly things just start taking care of themselves and unless you've been there you don't understand it amen we don't understand how i can no longer ever have a desire for this thing that's plagued me all of my life how is it that the thing that has its hooks in me the hook can just fall off and fall to the ground how can that happen i'm here to tell you it can happen it happened it's happening remember when the eagle begins to fly and gets above the influences of the earth the hold of the earth it starts to lose its hold and things just begin to fall away amen that's why trying to come amen to to your own righteousness before giving in to the spirit of god will never get you in contact with the spirit of god you finally have to come to the point said god would you just come and rescue this creature lift me out of the kernel i can't fix my life i can't fix my problems i can't do better amen what i need is to be lifted into the spirit realm and i need to recognize that you've already made me a king and a priest that i've already got a position that i'm already seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and that revelation and the reality of that in my life will begin to change everything else let me get everything backwards friends he's called us higher amen back to this quote on the church age book but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over a spiritual kingdom romans 5 17 for by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and if the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ and in colossians 1 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son are you waiting for translation or have you been translated you have been translated delivered from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son will there be another translation yes for your flesh but this one's not for your flesh this one's for your soul i've translated this into the kingdom and brother of the venomous reign of his dear son he says right now we reign with christ right now future in a thousand years yes right now we reign with christ let me go back and read romans 5 17 again he said much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ not a future reigning reigning now now you may not go down to the courthouse and go to the mayor's office and say hey i'm in charge that's not going to work that's not what that that's not what he's called us to now he's called us to rule and reign in spiritual realms spiritual dimensions spiritual things which will have effect on what takes place in the mayor's office but we're to operate in the spirit realm and watch it manifest in the natural right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin we have dominion over sin i'm not a slave to sin i don't have to sin oh praise be to god right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil [Applause] what does that mean i have dominion now over sin over the world that means i don't have to enjoy the world's entertainment i have dominion over it it doesn't have dominion over me i in the spiritual realm have dominion over sin over the world over the flesh i don't have to give in to youthful lusts i don't have to give in the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life because now amen now i'm ruling and reigning with him i'm a king and a priest with a dominion over the flesh the flesh is not ruling me amen i'm ruling the flesh [Applause] praise be to god i mean dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil oh this is good friends how many times have we went to god begging oh god please get that meat devil he's hurting me put the devil away oh god help me help me help me you're a king you're a priest you've got dominion this is your authority this is your ground this is for you to take amen when they moved into the promised land amen and there was an inheritance given to judah amen and caleb come along and said give me my mountain amen caleb wasn't saying oh it's a mountain oh there's giants there oh there's walled cities he knew all of that for he asked for his possession amen but it was his possession and it was his authority it was his dominion he was the king of that land he was the priest in that area and it was his job to drive out the inhabitants do you realize he wasn't going and he wasn't asking for help he didn't ask joshua for help amen because we went into the promised land amen it was portioned out to each one amen to rule to have dominion to have lordship over this piece of land you're there you're a kingdom of priest you're a holy nation there's no king over you under the joshua commission you're under the headship of the holy ghost and everybody has a right to their land everybody has a right to take their land everybody has a right to have their home and have their family raise their children you have a right amen and now quit whining take your land quit complaining recognize your position and move in position because god already made a promise as you move forward i'll put fear before you my fear and then before you i'll drive out the unhappiness i'll send the hornet god will do something but he'll do nothing if they sat there in gilgal and waited for the inhabitants to leave see that that's just the type of what we're supposed to be doing now that's the natural this is the spiritual and we sit around waiting for god to deliver us from things we sit around waiting for my desire to change waiting for habits to change waiting for sinful lustful things to fall off we don't realize he's given you dominion over that you take that land back you run that devil out you conquer that land and you conquer that enemy and you possess your own vessel [Applause] i pray that the quickening power of god comes down right now to help us recognize our position in our place because we're waiting for magical things to happen and it's not magical things that'll happen it's a realization of the real world and our real position in the real world that'll have an effect on this negative reflection i'm tired of my own spiritual laziness i'm tired of my own handicap where i've handicapped myself by wrong thinking how are you going to overcome by overcoming recognizing our position and moving forward he promised to do it for you amen he promised to go before you he promised to be with you he promised that wherever your feet shall tread that i've given to you he's promised it's yours it's already promised it was promised before they left egypt it was promised to us that this is our land that this is our inheritance the full privilege of the full promise of the full word is ours i can have everything that the word promises for me in this day it's already mine amen but i i can't sit around on my heels not doing anything just waiting for something to happen waiting for christ to come down conquer all the land give me the deed and say there i took care of it for you go in and get it he already took care of it it's already deeded in your name and he tells you to go get it because everything is an act of faith everything in the kingdom of god must be done by faith and everything that's apprehended from the kingdom of god must be apprehended by faith and too many times we'll believe after we see something happen when we begin to see things change i'll believe when i begin to see the desires of my flesh change then i'll confess that i'm a son of god then i'll believe that i'm redeemed and redeemable when i see some things changing no i believe it because his word said it there's a witness in my heart that it's the truth amen and i'll confess it no matter what's happening in my life i confess it because it's true and that that is my position my position by the word i am a redeemed son of god that's my position by the word amen when david was put into his position as king of israel he was king of israel it didn't matter what his brothers thought about it god put him in that position and he knew it it didn't matter how many mistakes he made he was still king of israel because god put him in that position it didn't remain it didn't matter how many times his political foes thought he shouldn't be in that position because of the sin and mistakes that he made that made no difference at all god had put him in that position and he was still in that position that was his position and there was power when he was in position and the rest of the nation prospered when david was in his right position peter amen was promised the keys to the kingdom but peter amen was a was a problem peter didn't yet have the new birth and and peter he began to chase chastise the lord and rebuke the lord for saying that he was going to die and and and be taken to jerusalem and killed amen he says far be it from you to let that happen and he was rebuked and and jesus said get thee behind me satan without curse of the things of man and not the things of god guess what he didn't change his mind about peter's position [Music] he didn't change his mind he didn't say oh peter i thought you would have been the guy but now i've got second thoughts because of what just came out of your mouth no peter was still the guy because before the foundation of the world peter was called chosen elected according to his will according to his purpose amen in the works were finished from before the foundation of the world they are already finished he's not changing them peter's going to get the keys peter's going to unlock the gospel to the three people types of the world nobody else is gonna do it peter's the one because peter was the one in the mind of god before the foundation of the world that was called to that position and nothing peter can do can get him out of that position talk about a revelation amen talk about an understanding of our position i pray that the quickening power of god falls in this place today to help us recognize our position and our place and our responsibility because peter he could fail peter could go and repent peter could weep bitterly but peter couldn't lose his position in christ he couldn't lose the keys to the kingdom david couldn't lose amen his throne even when peter was caught up amen when when disciples came from james he went to antioch and he had been eaten with the gentiles but now he plays the part of the hypocrite he gets caught up in the political move of the church and he's rebuked by paul guess what the keys didn't go from peter to paul because paul was writing peter was wrong peter still had him because that was his position paul had his position peter had his position john has his position and by the grace of god you and i have our position nothing's going to move us off of that position friends we can we we can live below our privileges we can allow spiritual amnesia to keep us away from where we're supposed to be but it's not going to change god's position praise be to god i think i'm going to try to finish this quote of the church age book it says right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil my goodness friends you don't know sometimes we just don't know that right now right now amen right now we reign with christ right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil that means the devil does not have dominion over you the devil does not have dominion over me but i have dominion over the devil so now we live in satan's eden amen where the devil has absolute control of the whole world absolute control of all of the politics all of the powers everything is tied up in him and he is the head and running the whole show amen so he is the god of this evil age we agree prophet of god said he's the god of this evil age he is the greatest power of the evil age he is the greatest power of all the worldliness and i have dominion over him [Applause] and i have dominion over him what's that tell you about satan's eden amen you're not subject to satan's eden you're not subject to this carnal world and all the powers amen you're only subject to god and his will in your life in this evil age the things he wants to accomplish in your life but you're not under the dominion of the god of this evil age the god of this evil age is under your dominion there's no fear in what the devil's going to do to me there shouldn't be any fear because the devil can only do to me what god allows the devil to do to me and if god allows the devil to make a move against me then god has a predetermined purpose and outcome so that he can get glory so that his word can be made manifest amen but that devil is under our dominion why because we're seated in heavenly places with christ jesus as joint heirs if your seed didn't have any places in christ jesus is a joiner with christ and you're under the minion of the devil christ is under the dominion of the devil are you subject to this world in the flesh you're subject to the will of god in this earthly journey for his glorification and for a testimony of his word but you have dominion over it all dominion over sin the world the flesh and devil i can't get past that sentence that's just such a good one showing forth his brain praise and glory showing forth himself what are you showing forth himself that word himself is all capital letters in the church age book showing forth himself you have dominion you reign with christ right now we reign with christ having dominion over send the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself if i got so much dominion why do so many bad things happen to me praise be to god so that he can show that he has dominion through you why does cancer come so cancer can be defeated why do troubles come so troubles can be overcome why do circumstances happen so circumstances can be overcome and then we realize these things happen they're predestinated to happen they're supposed to happen trial and tribulations are here they're supposed to happen they're prophesied to come they're in the scripture that they'll come amen we should expect them to come but when they come we're never under dominion of the devil ever ever ever we're never under dominion of sin we're never under dominion of the world or of the flesh or of the devil we are always reigning with christ and dominion over those things but even when christ was here so that he can glorify his father he subjected himself to the things that his father allowed so that he could overcome each one of them to prove that dominion was inside of him it didn't stop troubles from coming it didn't stop his beard from being ripped out or spit upon his face or hit with the stick amen that's not what this dominion looks like the dominion doesn't look like never a problem never a trial i coast over everything no you may get spit on they may hit you in the head with a stick but you're never under that dominion you're always in control because the control tower is on the inside that situation is not controlling you but he who controls the situation is alive inside of you directing your footsteps so that at some point he can prove who really is the god of this world who really is in control the doctors all line up and tell you one thing amen so that god can prove he knows more than doctors science will tell you there's no way out so that he can come along amen and prove that there's dominion inside of you over science dominion inside of you over virus dominion over cancer dominion over world dominion over sin dominion over the flesh dominion over the devil what's he trying to prove he's trying to show himself in you and how is he going to do it when you're just coasting along cruise control four lane highway no speed limit life is good that's not dominion dominion is proved in the face of obstacle dominion and power is proved in the face of circumstances why do you think it's going to get worse before it gets better for the bride you know all that brother branham said you know everything that's been prophesied should be a hunted persecuted little group they're trying to stop preaching like this they're going to try to shut these churches down and on and on and on the prophet goes we could list quote after quote after quote of what he's talking about and he speaks of in some of the most prominent messages he ever preached like christ is the mystery of god revealed why because the greatest display of christ and the bride will come in the face of the greatest opposition why will the great opposition come to prove who's in her to prove she is him what's he declaring what's he showing forth himself amen why do troubles come so that he can show himself in you there's dominion inside of you there's a there's a king on the throne in you and you're a joint heir sitting on the throne with that king praise be god we're not subject to the devil we're not subject to the world we're not subject to the flesh we're subject to our father and we're subject to his plan before the foundation of the world we have got to let the word of god change our thinking we have got to let what the prophet told us change our thinking amen if anything happens amen it crossed his sacred desk first for his signature of approval amen so if anything comes this is for his purpose and for his glory and it's not to destroy it's too it's not to be destroyed but it's so that he can destroy amen praise be to god so we're never under dominion we're never in defeat we're always in victory we're always in dominion we're always a joint heir we're always ruling and reigning with him praise god showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and made us priests yes priests unto him offering the spiritual praise of sanctified lips spending our lives is a sweet offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning you realize this is a priesthood there's king we're kings and priests we have dominion over a spiritual kingdom but we are also priests interceding and petitioning priest and kings and to our god no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father amen let's go to first peter chapter two first peter chapter 2 and verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people this sounds like exodus 19 to me you see the similarities what has god always wanted he's always wanted a people a kingdom of kings and priests that's what i always wanted that's what he's getting now you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into the marvelous light and his marvelous light you are not just a priesthood a royal priesthood not just a priesthood a royal priesthood because we're not after the priesthood that was established on earth through aaron that was an earthly priesthood and if you read the book of hebrews he said jesus didn't come as that kind of priest because that was already established over carnal worldly ordinances in an earthly way had an earthly priesthood he would have never come that way because that was already established but he came after the order of melchizedek and melchizedek is the king of righteousness the king of salem and priest of the most high god so melchizedek is the high priest but what kind of priest a royal priest because he's a king and a priest and we've been called into a royal priesthood so not a priesthood after the order of aaron or earthly amen when jesus was here jesus was not slaying lambs and burning them on the altar he was a high priest he come as a high priest he went back as a high priest amen he was here to make a sacrifice and to take the blood of the sacrifice and not for the earthly things but to purge and cleanse the heavenly amen to set an order away for us but it was after a high priest after the order of melchizedek not earthly but heavenly and royal it was he was a royal high priest and now we are a priest in the order of the royal high priest after the order of melchizedek we have come out of that priesthood that's our priesthood it's eternal and it's heavenly we're kings and priests amen kings and priests kings of a spiritual kingdom and priests over the heavenly realm because the high priest is there and we're after that same order of that high priest we're here as a spiritual priest brother mum said interceding and petitioning let's turn to matthew 9. matthew 9 and verse 36 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as a sheep having no shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray you therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into the harvest here's what brother branham says about the scripture and identified christ of all ages 1964 one time standing looking upon the harvest jesus said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few pray the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest and he was the lord of the harvest you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not ask abundance that your joys might be full see he's depending on you asking and believing that you receive what you asked for okay he's depending on you asking why because we're a priesthood to make intercession and petitions so we're part of the royal priesthood we're here on earth but we're a part of a heavenly priesthood a spiritual supernatural priesthood here upon the earth amen and we're here for intercession and petitioning and jesus when he looked at his disciples he was the lord of the harvest he saw the condition of the harvest but he wasn't going to move in the harvest until he got the disciples to be joint heirs and partners with him in redemption and he said you pray to the lord of the harvest he was the lord of the harvest see he's setting up something here that's going to make something mean something to us amen he was the lord of the harvest he saw the condition he knew he didn't have to be told what the condition was he didn't have to be told that the harvest is ready and there's not laborers he already knew that but he told them to pray to the lord of the harvest that he'll send laborers into the harvest why because god has so orchestrated his system that he won't do anything without man he put man on partnership with him there's got to be somebody on this earth with a heavenly priesthood a royal priesthood that can intercede amen that can petition god who else on this planet can intercede and petition god who else can cry out and have the ear of god amen and have god move he's looking for a priesthood a royal priesthood amen that's already in their office not coming to an office but in office and we're here to petition we're here to intercede we're here to ask god amen does he not know he already knows daniel began to pray because daniel wanted the revelation and understanding of the 70 weeks 70 years of captivity that jeremiah wrote about and when he begins to pray jeremiah comes at the right time he happens to come to the end of the 70 years he's in the right season he's the right person he's a prophet god knows he's there and god knows what date it is but when daniel begins to pray heaven goes into action gabriel says from the first day they prayed i was sent to thee what happened what moved the whole plan of god into action this was god's plan this is what god wanted this was the right time it's the right season he's the right person and remember what happened the right person in the right season amen begin to ask the right prayer and the right prayer and the right season by the right person amen put god into action and he sent gabriel down and what more it started a battle in the spiritual realm because gabriel there's a whole spiritual realm that operates by god's laws don't ask me to tell you what they are because i don't understand but there's a law there's an order there's a structure there's dominion there's powers there's principalities right because we war not against flesh and blood but of powers and principalities and wickedness in heavenly places we're fighting a spiritual battle all the time not an earthly battle this is not something that's going to be won with the gun this is not an earthly battle this we're fighting principalities and powers in heaven in the heavens and in the heavenly realm there was a a a a a battle that took place amen when gabriel was dispatched and he went and the in the prince of persia withstood him and won't let him enter into his dominion you think gabriel an angel from god he can't go wherever he wants god's got laws god's got lost i don't know i can't explain them all to you but you can read the scripture and see god's got laws somehow the the prince of persia that demon spirit over persia had a right to withstand gabriel and gabriel couldn't just enter into his territory and daniel was under his territory but when daniel prayed and he was persistent took 21 days but gabriel had to go back and get michael to help him and when michael would help him michael amen michael was able to overcome the the prince of persia and then gabriel was able to enter into his jurisdiction come down into daniel and deliver the message of daniel and tell daniel the first day you prayed i was sent but all this battle broke out oh friends do you realize amen it was daniel's prayer that put heaven in action it was daniel's prayer and now heaven's moving they're moving into action because god said now's the time i had somebody on the earth to intercede i had somebody to petition now i can get into action because the lord of the harvest needed somebody to pray to the lord of the harvest that will send laborers into the fields and when they did now he can get into action you realize you have not because we ask not amen and then sometimes things don't happen immediately because we have no idea what kind of spiritual battle is breaking out all around us we have no idea what power is trying to hold dominion and what power is trying to break them in we have no power in the spirit realm what's going on all around us amen but we have to pray with faith believing knowing our position knowing we're kings and priests knowing that god will move knowing that we have access to the throne of god by grace knowing that he hears our prayer and knowing that he will answer according to his word and we have to hold on by faith and not give up amen not what would have happened if daniel would have gave him so now is probably not the time that's not for me to know i don't know what would have happened i don't know how the story would have went you'll never know how the story would have went you only know how the story was but it makes you wonder we have to we have to ask in faith believing we receive whatever we ask for that's what the prophet says he said he is depending on you asking why because you're part of the royal priesthood to intercede and petition he's depending on you asking and believing that you receive what you ask for he's depending on two things you asking and you believing if you don't ask believing stop asking i think sometimes we ask out of habit things we shouldn't be asking for because we actually don't believe it we're just asking out a habit like there's been times i've been guilty of this there's been times somebody is ill very ill terminally ill and somebody asked to pray for their healing and in my heart i feel not to that sounds horrible somebody's terminally ill don't pray for their healing but i don't i don't if i don't feel to how can you pray the prayer of faith pure faith that they'll be healed so all you can do is ask for the family ask for grace ask for mercy ask god to have his way and do it because there's so many times that in your heart you you don't in your heart you don't see them raised up and walking around and if you don't already see that don't ask for it i think we pray too many prayers out of habit first time something happens we just oh god take care of this i want this and this and this to happen but not waiting until faith rises up waiting until we have that inspiration waiting till there's faith and all of a sudden we see the word and we see the promise and something in me says it's now it's mine i can have it now because the prayer of faith it's the prayer of faith not just prayer and so many times we begin to hinder our own faith by praying prayers out of tradition and habits we pray prayers out of tradition and habit hoping something will change but not believing they will and if we're really honest with ourselves we have all prayed prayers of hope not prayers of faith and we've prayed prayers out of tradition or prayers out of sympathy and tradition but not really from faith in our hearts because if it's god's faith he dropped in your heart there's no way that won't happen if it's god's faith not you but if it's god's faith he's dropped into your heart a revelation of what his plan is in this situation amen and you know that god dropped that in my heart i've been inspired i mean there's no way that won't happen i think we shouldn't be so quick to pray i think sometimes we should be quicker to meditate and then pray meditate on the word meditate on the situation and say god would you reveal to me what you want done in this situation because if you can catch an inspiration from the lord and you can pray a prayer of faith then you can rest your soul that god is going to perform what he said he's going to perform i think we have to realize this is a royal priesthood we're not playing around this isn't a game god has not given us his word to toy with and play with and human emotion type thing this isn't for human emotion this isn't for human sympathy this is a royal priesthood after the order of melchizedek this is serious this is real this is powerful and i feel like sometimes i have limited the power because i just go back to praying out of a traditional mindset oh something bad let's all go to prayer instead of saying do i feel like they're going to be healed do i feel like they'll be delivered do i feel like god wants this situation to end right now and we pray so many times with our fingers crossed i mean you may not actually cross your fingers but subconsciously we're praying hoping it's going to work out hoping and that's why you start to hear desperate prayers oh god please please please oh god is that a prayer of faith is that a prayer of faith oh god please please that's not a prayer of faith but a prayer of his god i see in your word and i know who i am and i believe in my heart that you're going to fulfill this word and this is going to come to pass and i'm asking you lord as a son of god to move in this situation and do according to your word that's a different kind of prayer friends that's the prayer that gets results it's the prayer of faith he's depending on you to ask and to believe i think sometimes we'd be better off not praying so quickly and spend some time meditating find the mind of god and then pray that's a different way of thinking isn't it friends but we're kings and priests we're not just denominational people we're not just people hoping things are going to work out that's not who we are we're the children of god we are sons and daughters of a living god with a real spiritual heritage and a reality amen we need not to handle it like it's a vapor it's a myth sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't i don't want that kind of experience in my life sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't i want to meditate in the lord and be moved by inspiration of the holy ghost and be moved by revelation that when i pray i pray with earnest faith i know god's going to move because i feel inspired to pray for this i feel moved by the holy ghost i feel like this is the time this is the season this is the word and i'm moving out of an abundance of faith in my heart not hoping something will work out praise be to god that's good preaching even if it makes us all feel a little rough on the inside you know brother man we come to the end of preaching he goes oh i feel all scoured out inside i tell you this kind of preaching will make you say oh that i've done bad a lot oh god forgive me but praise be to god he's bringing the reality of his word so that we can operate in real realms of faith not pretend realms of faith not denominational hope so but real legitimate faith on the word of god so that our faith has a resting place on the revelation of his word knowing that there's a foundation to what we're asking for and god will build on that foundation amen then you can be like abraham calling those things that are not and those things that are as though they're not then you can start to see for the unseen and know that god's moving angels are moving something's in action war is breaking out in heaven something's moving because i prayed the prayer of faith not the prayer of hope so then the devil's not going to come and get you to doubt your confession get you to doubt what you just said because you waited for an inspiration of the holy ghost and you moved by the spirit of god into asking god this is a royal priesthood friends amen praise god that's the kind of life i want to live a life led by god a life based on revelation amen brother graham said in the message perseverance our heavenly father thou knowest the needs before we even ask is that true then why ask because he said to you because he needs a priesthood for intercession and petitioning you know he needs a royal priesthood and there's a royal priesthood it's a spiritual world priesthood here on earth for intercession and petitioning so where is intercession found in the royal priesthood it's the high priest inside the priests that is interceding that's where intercession is found because when the bride goes up the spirit goes up and now there's no more intercession so this isn't a trivial thing friends this is power this is real power of god in action in a mini-membered bride this is the reality because when this many many bride member bride is called off of this earth there is no more intercession there is no more change there is no more blood so what's it attached to the priesthood the priesthood after the order of melchizedek is what it's attached to he said our heavenly father thou knowest the needs before we ask jesus taught us that your father knows what you have need of before you ask but yet we're we are told we are to ask when he looked upon the harvest he was the lord of the harvest and he said the harvest is ripe the laborers are few pray you the lord of the harvest that he will may send laborers into the harvest making himself with man so bound together that he works only through the agency of man he chose man to work for him he could have chose the son to preach the gospel he could have chose the winds or the trees or the stars but he chose man veils himself inside hides himself from the unbeliever reveals himself to who he will who is it it's the high priest inside the priest it's the priesthood of melchizedek it's the melchizedek that has come down in that cloud that's why brother brennan said who is this melchizedek not who was who is it's the melchizedek priesthood that's come down the high priest has come down and where is the high priest inside the priesthood it's the same priesthood now in a mini-membered body now it's him in us amen not our mind but the quickening power that has quickened that seed to life which is part of him all to manifest him not to play around with things but to have the real thing that's what we want friends is the real thing i it doesn't matter to me if i go years between prayer requests as long as i can pray by faith and when i pray by faith he does exactly what his word says amen that's enough for me amen i know i'm tired of just salting out and sprinkling out a bunch of prayers and hoping that the abundance of prayers will bring back a few answers [Applause] but it's got to be the prayer of faith it's got to be the reality it's got to be the high priest and the priest making intercession and petitioning no more denominational ideas no more traditional approaches no more human mind involved but the mind of christ and waiting and meditating to be put in action amen until he says pray till he says you ask praise be to god amen who was it that come down that day amen and stood to his feet and said howdy right you whatever you say you ask amen now she could ask by faith amen that wasn't the prophet that was god and the prophet and when he come to her and said now it's time for you to ask and whatever you ask it'll be praise be to god we need that same thing to take place in our hearts right now not for brother brethren to come back and tell us but the one who was actually speaking that day to speak into our hearts and say now it's time to ask that is your promise you don't have to put up with that that you've got dominion over that now's the time to conquer what is preeminence it's the bride under control total complete control i'm ashamed at my whiny prayers i have become ashamed at the way i talk to god i have become ashamed at that my wife my whining am i complaining but by the grace of god he's lifting us out of the carnal into the spiritual to see our position our place our position and our responsibility so that we're not whining we're not complaining we're not grumbling we're seeking the mind of god god i'm here i'm here for a fresh download from you i'm here this is the situation what do you want done in this situation god i'm looking to you your word says this inspiration comes god i believe by faith amen according to the promise in your word you're going to do this brother ben said if you don't come believing don't even come in the prayer line now you know the word you know bias stripes you're healed you can say it over and over and over again and it's every bit the truth every time you say it but if it's not faith in your heart he said don't even come through the prayer line because it's not the words that are spoken but it's the faith in the heart [Music] praise be to god god let us operate in the realms of reality the true reality he says in the end time sign seed 1962 then you say well jesus healed the sick he is the word he is the word when you receive the word you receive jesus for he is the word amen how do you receive jesus receive the word he says the word was made flesh and one among us we believe that don't we every bit we believe that christ is god's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing so what's his bride god's word made manifest we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head and when he died and rose from the dead and resurrected and set on high by the majesty of god on his throne right hand of majesty then we are his delegates and we reckon ourselves dead and buried by baptism raised with him and now seated together with him in heavenly places in christ jesus that get us off shouting wouldn't it think of that we are not will be we are now now we are the sons of god now we are daughters of god not we will be seated now we are seated that's the revelation we have to keep we have to keep in our mind we are now kings and priests we are now sons and daughters of god we are now seated in heavenly places i don't have to hope anything's going to work out i don't have to try anything out i just have to patiently wait on the move of god to move in my life because it will absolutely work because i am now in that position i'm not hoping to move in that position and i'm not hoping through good conduct i'm not hoping that somehow through a righteous life or or through more uh more dedication and more this i move into more of that i am already now i'm not working my way into it to where someday i can say now i'm arrived now i'm operating as a son of god i am a son of god now i am seated in heavenly places now amen i am now kings and priests praise be to god but listen to this quote possessing all things 1962 yet abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yeti he had to fight to possess it amen oh praise be to god friends the promise was his the land was theirs but they had to fight to possess it the promise is ours how we going to get it any differently than any other child of god ever got it anywhere else in the bible we have the whole bible as our example and this whole bible is to be fleshed out in our day amen and every time the promise came to pass tell me how it came to pass was it easy amen was it through no difficulty no trial no tribulation no difficult circumstances but the promise was always acquired every child of god had to fight for it they had to hold their position they had to stand in faith they had to be patient they had to endure to the end they had to apply all the characteristics of the nature of god amen in order to apprehend that prize amen it didn't come easy it didn't come free it didn't come cheap amen but it always came because it was a promise of god and the ones that had faith were willing to endure to the end the ones that had faith were willing to be mocked ridiculed chastised they were willing to be rejected they were willing to be persecuted because they knew that was their promise and they knew that it would come to pass abraham wasn't hoping the three children in the fire furnace weren't hoping they said he's able but if he doesn't don't matter to me i know who i am they weren't hoping they were right they knew they were right praise be to god we can't be walking around this earth hoping we're children of god hoping i'm part of the bride hoping that someday i'll make it that's all got to vanish away that's never going to apprehend the promise there's going to be no translation of the body hoping we're bride hoping we're a child of god that's not going to get it done friends it's got to be something real something that's solid something that's true he said there you are the believer today yet we're heir to all things yet we're heir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight every inch of it that's the way god has set it up amen oh we're not going to change it that's the way god set it up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know is your own see you can't hope it's your own you'll never stick through the fight you'll never endure to the end remember the scripture says he that endure to the end shall be saved so in order to endure to the end you must already know you're saved not hoping you can endure to the end to find out whether you're saved or not you'll never endure to the end hope won't endure to the end faith will so it's it's not he that says anything or he that runs a little piece or acts a little way but he that endureth to the end what will get you to the end a revelation of who you are now and what god has for you now and walking in that reality down regardless of the circumstances will give you endurance to the end it's always been that way you have to fight to possess what you know as your own you have to fight to possess it and that's what we have to do now first we have to catch a revelation that it's ours first don't launch our hope you won't endure and you'll give up the fight you have to know it's yours and you have to know that you can win oh the secret to winning the fight is knowing you can win the fight because it doesn't mean that you don't get knocked down you don't get tossed around you don't lose a few battles but you have to already believe you won you say brother branham i need healing the promise is yours does anybody need healing in here today take this to heart the promise is yours can you believe that by faith as a child of god do you believe that that's yours that's your promise i am a royal seed of abraham i am heir to every promise it's mine that's a good starting point the promise is yours but if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy i'm going to tell you that you're going to have to take it away from satan amen you need healing i mean that's why these these little frivolous prayers oh god and then it doesn't work out oh yeah i guess it didn't work out he said you're going to fight for it you believe it's yours you're already healed you've got to fight for it you've got to take it from satan you know what that means he's not going to walk up to you and put that little that little sickness in a nice little package put a bow in and say here it's yours i'll give it to you i'll give it back i'll take my no you've got to take it back from him take your healing take your health take it back from him satan captures your health you got a right to go to satan say give it back hand it over i come in the name of the lord the possessor of heavens and earth and i'm his heir give it back you took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy and mixed up with the wrong girl i claim them that's right i claim my children i claim my brother i claim my sister yes satan you took them from god's house coaxed them out there but i'm coming after them i claim them well how you know i'm heir of all things amen it's given to me i'm an heir i can claim everything that god promised me amen there you are it's mine how do you get it something you've done no sir it's the unmerited gift that god gave us and it's ours it belongs to us satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with faith to say it's mine lay it down amen [Applause] to guess that let's go through that recipe again because that's a nice recipe for success satan cannot hold it if you go to him in the scriptural authoritative word with faith to say it's mine and lay it down amen you got to have the right word and you got to have the right faith remember i said in the message to patriarch abraham after 2 000 years has passed 2000 years and still here he is in our midst the mighty conqueror that rent the veil in two that took every sickness every disease everything upon himself and bore our infirmities to the cross and our sickness and our diseases and triumphed over them and raised up for our justification and stands alive after 2 000 years to manifest himself as a living jesus christ amongst the royal seed of abraham who are heirs of all things you keep catching that statement heirs of all things he fell heir to everything and you're a joint heir you're the royal seed of abraham heirs of all things oh my those who after goes through the test promise of the word if you can believe the word then you are also the seed of abraham how do you know your seed of abraham if you can believe the word boy he made that simple didn't he if you can believe the word then you're also the seed of abraham that's how you come to it if you can't take the word test then if you doubt it little suspicious of it you can't hardly believe it there is something other you can't believe it then don't you come in the prayer line see what happens let's just take this for example if you come in the prayer line with that little suspicion that little doubt that little uncertainty you're hoping that the faith of those in the prayer line that lay hands on me is greater than my faith you're hoping and depending in another person's faith and we put ourselves right back in bondage of denominationalism again instead of going through the prayer line with my own faith has nothing to do with them god spoke to my heart if i walk through this i'll be healed you tell me if i walk up here and if i walk up here and have the pastor lay hands on me if i have the elders and nobody i'll be healed then you're not depending on the preacher's hands [Applause] you're not depending on anybody else you've got a promise in the word and it's quick and alive in your heart and you're moving by the faith that god has given you in that word and it'll bring it to pass not bring ourselves under bondage hoping somebody else can believe for me sometimes i really think sometimes that's the reason that we panic and go into calling a bunch of people and asking a bunch of people to pray for us now there's an agreement in prayer there's nothing wrong with that if you move in your heart say i'd like a few brothers to agree with me in prayer on a specific thing that is wonderful if god moves on your heart you can agree in prayer on something but you see some people they start calling a bunch of people to pray and ask everybody you know to pray it's based solely on fear they're afraid and if i can get enough people praying god surely will hear but that's not action wasn't taken by faith it was taken by fear and anxiety and worry so it's different when you say i really feel like god's going to move in this situation and i feel like calling my brothers together to pray with me for that they if that's where your faith is god will move that's right but it's done by faith not by fear we are sons of god amen you are sons and daughters of god you are kings and priests now [Music] it goes on to say if you can't believe it then don't come in the prayer line i wouldn't even fool around the altar until you can get enough grace to know that god's word is true that's why people come to the altar get saved next year come to the altar get saved next year come to the altar get saved go do something they didn't think was right come and get saved you don't have to get saved multiple times having to get saved again means that you never had faith and salvation to begin with you never even knew what salvation was you don't get saved two or three times you can backslide and repent but you don't have to get saved multiple times i wouldn't even fool around the altar until you can get enough grace to know that god's word is true and when you once break through that veil of unbelief then you got the keys in your hands what keys the keys in your hands of death hell and the grave because you've got to conquer who conquered for you then you've got hebrews 13 8 that tells us jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever how can we do it the people to say oh well it'll tell you it's a certain way he is he is the same the bible said oh well he doesn't do today like he did we find it right now when we see his word vindicated what does it do it throws it right back into their lap again amen the real seed of abraham believes it they know it and he stands tonight as he met abraham up there on the days of lot and performed those miracles as he did by telling sarah what she said behind him jesus promised the royal seat of abraham that the church would see that same thing just before his coming what is it it's got to happen god promised it jesus christ confirmed it and said it would be so and here we are today after 2 000 years see him in our midst still the mighty conqueror he conquered death hell grave all superstition took the word yes he said if if ye abide in me in my words and you ask what you will and it shall be given to you what was it the word christ that's in your heart if you abide in me my word abide in you then you've conquered everything look at this if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you've conquered everything you're not hoping to conquer you've already conquered then you've conquered everything because i conquered it for you if you abide in me listen to this if you abide in me if you can understand me what does it mean to abide in him you have to have a revelation of who he is you have to understand him and understand his ways abiding in him is not believing one day and not believing the next day abiding in the in him is understanding who he is if you abide to me if you can understand me if you can abide in me he that believeth me that receiveth me not just make believe but can receive he that heareth my words understandeth my words you realize this is based off revelation not just hearing a word and being able to repeat it but actually understand what the word means what the words say actually see the picture of the bible he that hears my words understandeth my words and believes on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into temptation or condemnation but is passed from death into life here he is the mighty conqueror praise god we'll look at one more quote before we wrap up in return in jubilee 1962 right at the end of 1962 he preaches message returning jubilee he said now if someone or other the individual lost their inheritance he's talking about the law of jubilee and we know that after seven years in israel every seven years if if somebody had sold them as israelites sold themselves into slavery every seven years there's a release of the slave to go free but after seven years or seven cycles of seven years or 49 years are complete the next year brings you to the 50th year or the year of jubilee jubilee means 50. and in the year of jubilee not just the prisoner can go free but everything that belongs to him is restored back to him so jubilee is not just going free jubilee is not just understanding i'm saved amen jubilee is different than just knowing you're saved and not in bondage anymore jubilee is understanding you're back in position with everything that belongs to you has come back to you jubilee is redemption [Applause] it's more than just released through the church ages there was a release through seven church ages released release release release of those that were in bondage but at the end of the church ages amen we come to a jubilee time and when we come to jubilee amen it's time not just for the prisoner to go free but everything that belongs to him is going to be restored back to him amen his his revelation his understanding his life amen his eternal life everything is coming back everything that adam lost is going to be restored to man amen it's not just a release it's a restoring back it's redemption now someone or the other individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by god there came a year called the jubilee year that was every seven years they had a rest a sabbath every seven days they had a sabbath every seven years they had a sabbath and seven sabbath was 49 years and the 50th year was a jubilee and in this jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a freeborn and a true blooded israelite amen are you a true blooded child of god not a hybridized something or another but you came from god you come from the loins of god you're a true born son you realize when when i talk about kings and priests if you just go back and look at israel because that's always the type the natural type to be a priest you had to be in the loins of abraham of um aaron because it was by succession it was by family from aaron came his son and son and to be the priest so in order to be part of the priesthood you had to be in the lin the right lineage to be a priest and to be a king you had to be in the right lineage to be a king that means before you were expressed as a king you were in the loins of the king before you were expressed as a priest you were in the loins of the priest so before you can be expressed amen and the priesthood of melchizedek where were you before you can be expressed amen as a king amen where were you you were in the king you were in the loins of spiritual loins the spiritual gene of his life is in you now was in him there you had to come from the right lineage you can't just make yourself a king you can't just make yourself a priest this isn't somebody this isn't this isn't a crow putting peacock feathers in this isn't a crow putting dove feathers in it has to be born for that purpose it has to be in the right lineage if you're a king and a priest then you were in the loins of god before the foundation of the world because he's the king and the priest he's the and jesus christ came king of kings and you were in him when he was here he's king of kings you're a king he's the king of kings you come from that lineage so that means you have rights to be a king you have rights to be a priest because you come from the right lineage if you're a king and a priest then there's a revelation of origin attached to the priesthood and the kingship so who's going to move you from it you were born to be a king you were born to be a priest before you ever were born on this life you were a c gene in the thoughts of god you were predestinated to be in this position no one will move you from that position and that position holds power and authority and dominion and through spiritual amnesia we don't realize what our position is and we're wondering through life hoping someday we'll be a king and priest we're we're not in position and we have no power to overcome but by the quickening power of god when he gives us the realization by revelation of what our position is because of the lineage we came from that we are now kings and priests kings over a spiritual dominion or a spiritual kingdom priest amen after the order of melchizedek when we realize where that position gives us power for overcoming because we know who we are we know what we're supposed to do we know the word that applies to us we're not wondering about we're not tossed about we're secure we're planted we know who we are we're moving forward as kings and priests watching all the circumstances around us move out of the way because we're in position amen amen there's power that comes from our god-given position but through the church ages we lost our position we were in bondage and our inheritance got all tied up and wrapped up in all kinds of nonsense and we lost our inheritance we were separated from the promises living without our privileges living without our land but there come a jubilee amen and in this jubilee every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a freeborn and true blood of israel no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free free you don't have to pay for it it was already paid for he didn't have to pay a thing he didn't have to do a thing you get this friends we're talking about your jubilee we're talking about you moving back into your position back into herod back into the land that was ordained for you and i amen he didn't have to do a thing didn't have to pay a thing this isn't about getting it right this is not about paying this is about believing amen what's already been done by a spiritual revelation of the word of god moving into our position that's already ours we didn't have to pay a thing didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance we just had to stop living a chicken life stop living a denomination of life you didn't have to do anything that ego didn't have to do anything it already had everything it needed to do all i had to do was take those god-given wings flap them a few times and set the wings and move up in the air they don't have to do anything don't have to pay anything all you have to do is stop doing what you're doing and go back to your inheritance this message came amen to break our spiritual amnesia and this message came as a jubilee it was a jubilee trumpet it was a great trumpet amen to bring us back to what the faith of our pentecostal fathers what's pentecost 50. the term pentecost means 50 it's jubilee and he brought us back what to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers that opening in the seals is our jubilee trumpet to call us back and you don't have to pay anything you don't have to do anything you just have to stop doing what you're doing stop living a carnal life stop believing in denominations and dogmas and move back into the inheritance it's already given it's already ours it's already been written you don't have to do anything you don't have to change the words you don't have to manipulate anything all you got to do is move back into it [Applause] oh my he had a right to it that means you have a right to this revealed word it's your right it's not you're not hoping for a revelation you're not hoping the word works you have a right to this promised word it was a god-given right because he by grace had inherited it and it would be given to his fathers and handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant grace is his way provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last days are you getting the picture you see what man can do and when you see what god does what man does is failing and will fail has failed and always will fail but what god does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away god give it it's his free gift and by sovereign foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally and that jubilee was god's manner of expressing grace to his people with restoring or being bought back brought back to their rightful position what did our jubilee call do at the opening of the seals what did it do it brought us back to our rightful position as sons and daughters of god it took the book of redemption and put it back in the hands of man now all that adam lost belongs to the bride belongs to the children of god it's been given back we just have to walk by faith stop doing what we're doing and start moving into an inheritance and this revealed this revealed is our inheritance not the printed pages but the word amen made flesh the word revealed is our inheritance and we've got to stop doing what we're doing start stop serving the task master stop living like a slave [Applause] stop with the slave mentality stop laboring for somebody else's ideas stop working in somebody else's field but now i can go back to my portion my inheritance because i've been called to be the bride in this last day there's an inheritance there's a portion for me and that's the full measure of the new testament is my portion and i can live it and every promise in the book is mine and all i got to do is stop doing what i'm doing stop hoeing in somebody else's field and come back into my inheritance move back into the position god gave me and in that position is power because i'm placed there by god i said that was last quote but i'm sorry i repent i got one more christ is the mystery of god revealed because it's just gradually let loose paragraph 229 mystery christ is mr god revealed it's just gradually let loose as it did through the prophets and so forth until it was perfectly made known the godhead bodily in christ so all down through the old testament the mystery was gradually let loose through the prophets through the patriarchs through it all all the way down until finally it was made manifest perfectly made known that god had bodily in christ and now the christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband what's all of this doing what was the message sent for why did the message come what's the purpose of the message the message at the opening of seals is a jubilee trumpet to what bring the spiritual eve back to her position it's a jubilee call stop what you're doing stop what you're doing stop thinking the way you've been thinking stop serving what you've been serving come back into your position as kings and priests with god come back to the realization that you're a joint heir of all things come back to seated in heavenly places in christ jesus as a son of god with dominion with dominion you're not hoeing in anybody else's field you have dominion over sin the flesh the world and the devil the whole thing the whole thing is the revelation of god to take eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and god is the husband of the church and the church is his bride what was the purpose of the message to get the bride to hear the jubilee trumping to get here to realize you've lost your inheritance you've been in bondage amen the alpha church fell and died it went to the ground and rotted to come back the omega church amen now it's time for full possession of the full inheritance amen the message came as a jubilee trumpet the seals were open to sound of trump and it's a revelation of god to get eve back in her position again why is it here it's not here to show that there's been a mighty prophet on the land the message didn't come to show a mighty prophet amen god did that to get our attention so we would listen to that prophet so that he could give his message and his message was to bring eve back to her position with her husband again where seated on the throne joint heir of all things the mighty conqueror now that she and the mighty conqueror have been united together an invisible union and if you've been united together in a visible union you've already conquered all things and now what's taken place in the invisible realm is going to be made manifest the positive has already come together and now in the negative god is going to start showing what's already happened trial by trial circumstance by circumstance overcoming by overcoming victory by victory he's showing in this realm what has already taken place you've already conquered all things all things are already yours you're already in position you are a king and a priest what's it going to take believing that acting upon it speaking it by inspiration and watching everything move out of our way i don't want to do it again but i'm going to repent twice there's not one thing the christian has in his armor that's scientific did you know that love joy peace long sovereign goodness meekness gentleness patience faith holy ghost everything is unseen by science and that's the only thing that's real and lasting where's your inheritance it's unseen where's your position it's unseen science can't see it i'm a joiner of christ i'm seated with christ really you're like standing here you're sitting right there it's unseen to science but the things that are unseen are the things that are real and true and the things that are seen are the false i'm already see with crisis i'm a king and a preacher you don't look like much of a king that's because you're looking by science you're looking with carnal understanding you're not seeing the reality because the things that are unseen are the real and lasting things it takes a revelation from god to see the unseen things you don't see with these eyes you don't hear them with these ears but there's a set of eyes and a set of ears that can hear and see and they can hear and see the unseen realities of god but it's going to be by revelation to a to a specific group of people it's not okay to live a carnal life anymore it's not okay to keep doing what we were doing under the 49 years under the seven cycles of seven of the church ages it's not okay anymore serving somebody else's idea hoping somebody else will feed me being in bondage to somebody else's system or my own that's not gonna work anymore jubilee astounded jubilee sounded i'm gonna stop doing what i'm doing i'm coming back to my inheritance with faith that i'm a joint heir i'm a child of god i'm a son of the king i come from the right lineage and i am now a spiritual king and i am now a royal priesthood you want to manifest something else absolutely and i'll be that then too but that doesn't mean i'm not that now i encourage us all stop stop fighting the flesh we were not with flesh let's stop warring with flesh let's stop with all the carnal attempts to fix things let's stop with all the carnal trying to manipulate situations to make things work out let's move into our position as spiritual kings and priests and let's meditate on the word of god and pray for god to give us the answer the word in this situation i want to take that word and i want to plug it in here because if i can take that word and plug it in here by faith it's mine i don't care if i wait 25 years 50 years or 5 months or 5 minutes if that doesn't matter to me if i can by faith receive a revelation word and take that word and plug it in here by faith i will have whatsoever i have asked for let's start acting like kings and priests not like whatever i like children in this world but like children of the king let's all stand musicians if you come with a tommy you don't mind to come remember the story brother bam told of the slave market slave trader went down to the slave market he told that story numerous times we all know it he said there's one slave that didn't act like the rest oh i want to be that one in this earth that doesn't act like the rest i want to stand out to the rest of the world i want it to be noticeable that one there is not like any of the rest of them any because that's the question do you feed him better is he a boss over no he's in the same situation all of them in he's got to work amen he's got to go to the grocery store he's got to lay down and sleep amen he's got to live a natural life his hair is turning gray or falling out he says he's in the same he's in the same spot as the rest of them but yet he doesn't act like any of them that one slave stood up to the the slave trader he said i'd like to buy that when he said he's not for sale so what makes him so different so you know i used to wonder that myself until i found out but though he's a slave and far from home he knows back in the home country his father is the king of the tribe and though he's away from home he conducts himself as a son of a king we're not even in that exact same situation because we're a free people in the homeland in the spiritual realm we're free we're not in bondage anymore we've been liberated we're only here to express him we're only here for his purpose for his glorification and for his expression we're not here to be punished we're not here to suffer uh for no reason we're not here we're only here to bring glory to his name and so that he can manifest himself through the bride and if we can come back to our right position and know that i'm a king and i'm a priest and when god in his in his perfect thinking allows a child to come my way i'm not going to fall to the ground and kick and scream like a three-year-old and say god why this happening to me that's not remembering you're a king and a priest that's going back to spiritual amnesia oh god the most horrible thing has happened do you understand your flesh will respond in certain ways to anxiety and fear you can't stop that the flesh may feel fear may feel anxiety may feel sad but there's something on the inside that is going to take control of those emotions and say you know what i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i am not in bondage to this situation i'm not a slave to my emotions i am not in bondage to these circumstances or this world i am a king and a priest and i am going to conduct myself though far from home though in the middle of a bad situation i'm going to conduct myself like a king and a priest in that revelation the bride can face down anything no more spiritual amnesia no more being in bondage to the carnal elements of the world no more allowing fear to dictate every decision no more allowing amen carnal lust and flesh and worldliness to control us and control our responses no more of that we're not in bodies of that that's all under our dominion and now we're going to rise above it and we're going to act upon the word and the word only we're going to have faith in that word and watch that word bring to pass everything he said it would bring the past because we're not standing on a motion we're not standing on carnal thinking we're not standing on past tradition we're standing on the word and the word only because we are kings and priests and we know to operate in this realm we have to operate according to his word and if we operate according to his word in the unseen it'll manifest itself in the scene got to come with the right thinking with the right understanding with the right approach and everything we come to will move under our feet under our feet and under our feet we've got to keep moving friends you have to know the land is yours you have to know the jubilee call you have to know what it means now you got to go back and drive the squatters off the land you have to the jubilee trumpet sounded made the land was yours but you got to go move off the squatters you got to re-cultivate the fields if they went in the ruin you got to come back you got something to do you're a king and a priest we're not waiting for god to do everything we know who we are we know what our job is let's get busy doing it and watch him move everything out of our way god bless your friends let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father for your word lord it means so much to us and god i want to repent right now i lift my hands i'm sorry i'm sorry lord for forgetting who i am i'm sorry for complaining and whining and praying half-hearted prayers i'm sorry lord forgive me but i realize lord myself this is me this is chad lamb i realize lord that that's not what you want me to do and that's not why i'm here god i pray now that the revelation of your word will take control that i'll move into my position by the quickening power that brings a recognition of my position my place and responsibility and lord that you allow me lord to operate by faith lord i pray that you move all of us out of the carnal out of the denominational and into the jubilee to move back into the position you've called us to to take back all that's been been lost god let us conduct ourselves as children of the king as sons and daughters of god god have your way in us lord manifest yourself through us lord help us not to fear anything that comes help us not to have anxiety or fear or worry about what might come but help us to rest on the fact that you're in control that we're yours we came from you we're going back to you we're here serving your purpose that you want you you earnestly desire to be made manifest in us god i pray that you just help us to relax help us to believe that lord give us a greater faith quicken it to us lord there's any here that's struggling with fear and anxiety lord i pray that you would just quicken this revelation to them now that they would see their position by the quickening power and they would know all as well lord we just commit ourselves unto you use us for your glory speak your word through our lips by faith help us to operate with your mind you've given us your mind let us operate by your mind we ask these things in the precious name of jesus christ amen can we sing that song we are heirs number 275 we are heirs there's a extra verse or two that blake wrote we sang it one time i don't know if you caught it but but blake wrote it and i was in the back and i heard it i said where did that verse come from when we get down lower end you'll see it and i liked it because it's a positive confession we're heirs now we're not waiting for things to happen they're happening now and what's happening now will make the things happen in the future

waiting but already are we king and priest to god amen let's live like it friends let's believe it let's pray like it let's pray like conquerors let's pray like children of god let's pray like kings and priests let's not pray like slaves this isn't a slave prayer down in egypt they had a slave prayer when they were in bondage oh god free us oh god free us oh god freeze but someday they were free this isn't a slave prayer jubilee the jubilee sounded we've gone free no more carnal thinking no more worldliness no more sin amen we're free from those things we've got dominion over the devil we're back in position we know who we are eve has come back in union with her husband we're not singing songs of slavery anymore god free me god free me i am free i am the conqueror by his grace by the conqueror living in me satan's eden is not here to defeat me god has slipped in satan's either in such a humble way he snuck his nuclear device in and got it in and he's getting into position and one day he's going to pull the pin and christ in us will destroy the enemy you're not here to be defeated you're not here to be pushed down you're here for the greatest victory that's been won in this gentile age praise be to god we're not afraid anymore we're not fearful we're not intimidated all the flesh may waver but the reality on the inside brings it back in check this is the reality to us friends don't pray like a slave don't sing like a slave pray like a free man when their free men moved into their land and there was people in their inheritance they weren't praying the prayers of bondage they were praying the prayers of deliverance oh god give us victory oh god give us strength oh god strengthen my hand for war oh god use me to defeat this enemy give me strength give me power give me endurance because i'm driving him off of my land that's a different prayer we're not in bondage to babylon anymore we've been liberated we're back in the homeland we're taking back our land we're praying a different kind of prayer how do i take this city what's the way you want to march around it if we climb the walls do we pull them out in an ambush how do i take this city it's a different kind of prayer how do i defeat this enemy lord is it going to be uh a sound in a mulberry bush is it going to be 300 or 10 000. see god was always bringing victory but he was always doing it amen his way and what we're looking for is his way we're not crying because we're afraid we're not crying out oh god why have you left us oh god why have you forsaken us what's happening we know what's happening we're taking back the land we know there's demon powers opposing us we know we're supposed to conquer every one of them we know what we're supposed to do let's pray like we know what we're supposed to do we're praying for direction we're not saying oh god where are you he's in me conquering this enemy that's where he's at we're praying god is it the mulberry bush should i wait for the russell do you want to weed it down from ten thousand men to three hundred do you want me to march around it seven times and shout lord i know i'm gonna have victory i'm just looking for your way i'm looking for your leadership i'm not afraid of whether i'll overcome i'm not afraid of this diagnosis from the doctor i'm looking for your method amen is it are we going to divide into three companies and draw them out in the ambush are we going to scale the walls you see what i'm saying friends they always had victory when they did it god's way but god always did it in a specific way so that they were always dependent on his leadership we've got the word but if you just take the word and try to have victory with the word which one are you going to use the mulberry bush gideon's 300 men marching around jericho which one will you use they're all victory they're all telling you the same thing see it takes the leadership of the holy ghost to know how he'll conquer this time but he's going to conquer he's going to win this is my land and this is in my way and i've got to conquer this thing to keep moving so i'm just waiting on the lord to give me inspiration on how to conquer it and when inspiration comes you can speak and move forward because it'll work oh praise be to god friends i love this way better than the old way i love the jubilee call let's sing that song the winds of faith [Music] sing the song wednesday there's two roads [Music] but we've walked that one by sight too many times and it always ends in the same thing we always get defeated we always have regrets we always have to repent there's always something wrong with going that way and i'm tired of walking the way of sight forget sight i want to use spiritual sight and walk by the power of the unseen
