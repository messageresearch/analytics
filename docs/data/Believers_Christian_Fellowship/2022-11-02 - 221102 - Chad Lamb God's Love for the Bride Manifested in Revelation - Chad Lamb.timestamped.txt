[19:29] we thank you we give you preeminence now
[19:32] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[19:36] and God bless you while we're standing
[19:38] if we could turn in our Bibles to the
[19:40] gospel of Mark
[19:42] chapter 12.
[19:45] amen I'm just doing a remind everybody
[19:47] that we'll have communion service this
[19:49] Sunday for a second service and also
[19:52] that it's the end of daylight savings
[19:54] time so we want to remember Saturday
[19:55] night to push the clocks back amen
[20:01] let's look at Mark chapter 12.
[20:05] verse
[20:07] 29 I'd like to take for a subject
[20:10] tonight God's love for the bride
[20:12] manifested in Revelation but I'm going
[20:15] to start by finishing up something that
[20:17] I didn't finish up on Sunday so this
[20:20] will be just a little uh a capping off
[20:22] of Sunday
[20:24] Mark 12 29
[20:28] and Jesus answered him
[20:30] the first of all the Commandments is
[20:32] hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[20:35] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[20:37] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[20:40] with all thy mind with all thy strength
[20:42] this is the first commandment and the
[20:45] second is like namely this Thou shalt
[20:48] love thy neighbor as thyself there is
[20:50] none other commandment greater than
[20:52] these man God bless you as you take your
[20:55] seeds God bless you brother Emmanuel
[20:57] sister Mimi it's good to have you back
[20:58] amen it's good to have you in the
[21:01] service
[21:03] um
[21:04] so we looked at this Sunday and I just
[21:06] wanted to take just a few minutes and
[21:07] cap this off there was a piece that I
[21:09] wanted to add in before we moved from
[21:11] that but the the a scribe comes and asks
[21:14] Jesus what is the greatest commandment
[21:16] or the first commandment and he tells
[21:18] him to love the Lord Our God the the
[21:21] greatest commandment is the Lord our God
[21:23] is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord
[21:25] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[21:27] soul with all thy mind and with all thy
[21:30] strength this is the first commandment
[21:32] and the second is likened to the first
[21:33] love thy neighbor as thyself and so we
[21:37] know we've looked at the scripture and
[21:39] the whole law hangs on these two
[21:41] Commandments here let's go to Romans
[21:44] chapter 13.
[21:46] and read this scripture
[21:51] Romans
[21:53] 13.
[21:55] both of these scriptures we read on
[21:57] Sunday
[21:58] Romans 13. and eight
[22:05] oh no man
[22:06] anything but to love one another for he
[22:09] that loveth another hath fulfilled the
[22:11] law
[22:13] for this Thou shalt not commit adultery
[22:15] Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not still
[22:17] Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou
[22:19] shalt not covet if there be any other
[22:21] commandment it is briefly comprehended
[22:23] in this saying namely Thou shalt love
[22:26] thy neighbor as thyself
[22:28] so the the Commandments that God had
[22:30] given they could be summed up in two
[22:33] things or they could be fulfilled with
[22:35] two actions one is to love the Lord thy
[22:38] God with all thy strength with all thy
[22:40] heart with all thy mind with everything
[22:42] and to love thy neighbor as thyself with
[22:45] those two actions we can fulfill the
[22:47] whole commandment of God
[22:49] and and so we know that when God called
[22:52] Israel unto themselves in Sinai he came
[22:56] down to make a covenant with his people
[22:58] in his Covenant he spoke with his own
[23:00] voice upon the mountain and when he
[23:03] spoke they were supposed to come up unto
[23:05] him but we know they ran away instead
[23:06] but the voice spoke the Commandments the
[23:09] ten what we call the Ten Commandments
[23:11] which is the God's covenant with Israel
[23:13] and in in in Deuteronomy if we could
[23:16] just turn to Deuteronomy chapter 5 I
[23:19] just want to lay this in because I don't
[23:20] want to leave this out Deuteronomy
[23:23] chapter 5.
[23:25] Moses and Deuteronomy is rehearsing the
[23:27] things that the children of Israel have
[23:29] been through and the things that have
[23:30] happened and he comes in in Deuteronomy
[23:33] chapter 5 verse 2 and he says the Lord
[23:37] Our God made a covenant with us in Horeb
[23:39] so he goes all the way back this ties
[23:41] all the way back to Exodus 19. so he's
[23:44] discussing the same the same thing the
[23:47] same event when the Lord God made a
[23:49] covenant with us in horeham the Lord may
[23:51] not this Covenant with our fathers but
[23:53] with us even us who are all of us here
[23:56] alive this day the Lord talked with you
[23:59] face to face in the mount out of the
[24:01] midst of the fire I stood between the
[24:04] Lord and you at that time to show you
[24:06] the word of the Lord for you were afraid
[24:08] by reason of the fire and went not up
[24:11] into the mountain they were supposed to
[24:13] go up into the mountain to be United
[24:14] with God but when they saw the fire and
[24:17] they heard the voice and the trumpet
[24:19] sounded long and God spoke to them face
[24:22] to face Moses said they couldn't endure
[24:24] it and they ran away and that's when
[24:27] they spoke to Moses that you go whatever
[24:29] he says come back and now he says you
[24:32] were afraid but this is that that was
[24:35] injected in there but when the Lord God
[24:37] spoke to you face to face out of the
[24:39] mountain in the midst of fire down at
[24:41] verse 5 saying so we drop out what's in
[24:43] parentheses saying I am the Lord thy God
[24:46] which brought thee out of the land of
[24:47] Egypt from the house of bondage Thou
[24:49] shalt have none of their gods before me
[24:51] Thou shalt not make any Graven image so
[24:53] we go right into what is commonly known
[24:56] as the Ten Commandments that's what God
[24:58] spoke to them on Horeb out of the fire
[25:00] when the when the trumpet sounded long
[25:02] when God spoke to them face to face this
[25:05] is his Covenant with Israel do this and
[25:08] we will be United forever
[25:11] we get down to the bottom of this let's
[25:13] go to verse 22.
[25:17] these words the Lord spake unto all your
[25:19] assembly in the mount out of the midst
[25:21] of the fire of the cloud and of the
[25:23] thick Darkness with a great voice and he
[25:26] added no more
[25:28] this was all this was going to be the
[25:31] full Covenant between God and his people
[25:33] these kept this is the Covenant amen
[25:36] that to have no other gods before me to
[25:39] make no graven image to not take the
[25:41] name of the Lord in vain to remember the
[25:44] Sabbath and keep it holy to honor your
[25:46] father and your mother to not kill and
[25:48] to not commit adultery do not steal do
[25:51] not bearish false witness and do not
[25:53] covet anything of thy neighbors that was
[25:55] the Covenant if you do that amen when I
[25:58] speak come and Unite with me this is the
[26:01] Covenant that will bring us together
[26:02] amen and God added no more that was all
[26:05] of it
[26:07] but when the people refuse to come to
[26:09] him in his voice amen they ran away and
[26:12] sent Moses and says whatever he tells
[26:14] you will do he already told the Covenant
[26:16] but they could not endure amen God's
[26:19] speaking to them directly and and this
[26:21] Covenant that God was going to make so
[26:23] now God gives Moses a book of law
[26:27] and that book of law was how that you
[26:30] would administer all of these things it
[26:33] was it was an Administration with
[26:35] guidelines and with punishment
[26:39] it was if you borrow your neighbor's uh
[26:42] mule and it dies and this is how you
[26:45] restore it and if you and if you find
[26:47] your neighbor's animal lost this is how
[26:48] you keep it this is how you restore it
[26:50] and if if you and if you have this issue
[26:52] this is how you deal with it and this is
[26:54] the punishment for not doing this and
[26:56] now they're because now they're sets up
[26:58] a whole ritual and ceremony to to coming
[27:01] to God to worship God in the beginning
[27:04] that was not part of the Covenant
[27:07] but but because they refused amen now
[27:10] God now shows them how difficult it's
[27:13] going to be to do this your way amen you
[27:15] do it my way this is all I'm asking you
[27:18] to do but now you want a code of rules
[27:20] now you want something that you can do
[27:22] not to have to face God direct but have
[27:25] an intermediary to have Moses in between
[27:28] now you're going to have a book of law
[27:31] that is going to guide you on how to be
[27:34] good to your neighbor and how to do all
[27:35] of these things and how to approach unto
[27:37] God and with it will come punishments
[27:41] that wasn't the original Covenant
[27:43] but if we look at the original Covenant
[27:46] and the greatest two Commandments that
[27:48] Jesus speaks of you'll find that the two
[27:51] Commandments that brother that Jesus
[27:53] speaks of completely 100 percent fulfill
[27:57] the Covenant of God
[27:59] because the first four things that God
[28:01] listened the Covenant is have no other
[28:04] God before me make no graven image don't
[28:06] take the name of the Lord in vain
[28:08] remember the Sabbath and keep it holy so
[28:11] if you will love the Lord your God with
[28:13] all your heart with all your strength
[28:15] with all your soul with all your mind
[28:16] you will fulfill those first four
[28:20] then the next six in the Covenant is
[28:23] honor your father and mother do not kill
[28:26] do not commit adultery do not steal do
[28:28] not bear false witness and do not covet
[28:31] if you will love your neighbor as
[28:33] yourself you will fulfill the last six
[28:35] the whole Covenant of God is kept in
[28:38] loving God and loving your neighbor
[28:41] that's what God wanted from the
[28:43] beginning that's what God was asking his
[28:45] people to do that's that's why Jesus
[28:48] says this is the first and the next is
[28:50] likened to the and all the law was
[28:52] fulfilled in this love thy neighbor as
[28:54] thyself amen put God first and love your
[28:57] neighbor as yourself and that's what God
[29:00] wanted from his people amen he didn't
[29:03] initially desire a book of law that came
[29:06] at the rejection of Christ the rejection
[29:09] of God speaking to them face to face and
[29:11] we know it had to be that way because
[29:13] this could the the law had to come as a
[29:16] school Master to bring them into Christ
[29:19] so that they could understand how much
[29:20] they needed a Grace Covenant
[29:23] But but so now we find out that when
[29:26] Jesus said was spot on Amen that is the
[29:29] Fulfillment of the Covenant and it's the
[29:31] same thing today amen if we will love
[29:34] the Lord Our God with all of our heart
[29:36] with all of our strength with all of our
[29:38] mind with all of our soul and love our
[29:40] neighbor as ourselves we will be doing
[29:42] what he's asking us to do and if we do
[29:44] that there doesn't need to be ceremony
[29:46] there doesn't need to be ritual there
[29:48] doesn't need to be law and there doesn't
[29:49] need to be punishment
[29:52] we just give give him our all and love
[29:55] our neighbor as ourselves
[29:58] and so that was God's covenant and the
[30:01] Fulfillment of God's covenant is love
[30:05] because God is love
[30:08] now I want to take a look in Genesis
[30:10] chapter 39.
[30:13] that was the peace that I didn't want to
[30:15] leave off from Sunday I wanted to
[30:17] include that and include that
[30:18] understanding what that means when what
[30:21] Jesus said and what Paul teaches
[30:25] now if we go to Genesis 39
[30:29] in verse 7
[30:30] this is the story of Joseph Joseph is
[30:33] now Steward and Potiphar's house
[30:35] and we know this is when he's going to
[30:36] be tempted by Potiphar's wife and in
[30:39] Genesis 39 verse 7 it says and it came
[30:42] to pass after these things that his
[30:45] master's Wife cast her eyes upon Joseph
[30:47] and she said lie with me but he refused
[30:50] and said unto his master's wife behold
[30:53] my master what if not what is it what is
[30:55] with me in the house and he hath
[30:57] committed all that he hath to my hand
[30:59] there is none greater in his house than
[31:02] I neither hath he kept back anything
[31:03] from me but thee because Thou Art his
[31:06] wife how then can I do this great
[31:08] wickedness and sin against God
[31:12] I love what Joseph says he begins to
[31:16] reason with the woman and begins to tell
[31:18] her uh his position but at the end of
[31:21] the day he says how can I do this great
[31:23] wickedness and sin against God
[31:26] and and that is what made Joseph so
[31:29] special and that's what made so many of
[31:31] the characters in The Bible so unique is
[31:34] that they were god-conscious
[31:36] they were God conscious about their
[31:38] actions they were god-conscious about
[31:40] their deeds amen that that it wasn't
[31:43] just I don't want to get caught amen
[31:45] with Pharaoh I don't want to get caught
[31:47] in this deed I don't want to lose my
[31:49] position as a steward it wasn't just I
[31:51] don't want the consequences for the
[31:53] action it says how can I sin against God
[31:56] Amen it was conscious not of of the
[31:59] negative things about his own person or
[32:01] the negative consequences to the action
[32:03] but it was a love for God that kept him
[32:06] from from Potiphar's wife
[32:09] it wasn't just a fear of consequences
[32:11] but it was a love of God and that's what
[32:14] I I love so much about Joseph is he was
[32:17] conscious of God he was aware of God and
[32:20] he was living for God
[32:23] and and as the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[32:25] should be nothing less amen it is we
[32:28] don't serve God out of fear of
[32:30] punishment that's that's not what God is
[32:33] looking for in this day he's not looking
[32:35] for servants he's looking for a bride
[32:37] he's not looking for people that were
[32:39] cower under his hand he's looking for
[32:41] somebody that will come to his voice
[32:43] [Music]
[32:44] and and he wants somebody that'll come
[32:47] amen because they love him that will
[32:50] obey there's so many people that will
[32:52] serve religious services and religious
[32:55] duties because they want to go to heaven
[32:57] and there's a fear if we don't fulfill
[32:59] the religious duties we'll not go to
[33:01] heaven that that's a denominational idea
[33:04] that is not what God once brought into
[33:06] this bride age he wants something
[33:08] completely different he wants to bring
[33:10] us back amen where Israel was when he
[33:13] was going to give him the Covenant now
[33:14] this bride has come back to God speaking
[33:18] his own voice amen giving his own her
[33:21] heart his own word to his bride and he
[33:23] wants her to come unto him
[33:26] not to get to heaven
[33:29] amen
[33:31] but because she loves him
[33:35] let's look at Acts chapter 13.
[33:49] I want to be in my life more God
[33:51] conscience
[33:53] I don't want to say I don't want to do
[33:55] that because uh there could be legal
[33:58] consequences
[34:00] I don't want to do that because uh uh I
[34:04] could have retribution or somebody could
[34:06] be angry with me or somebody could be
[34:07] upset of course we don't want to make
[34:09] anybody upset and we don't want to break
[34:10] any laws and we don't want to pay any
[34:12] fine I mean that's the reality but I
[34:14] want something motivating me that's
[34:16] deeper than that how can I sin against
[34:18] God Amen if this is a violation of God's
[34:21] word if God told me to give what is uh
[34:23] give Caesar what is Caesar's then I want
[34:26] to give Caesar what is Caesar's because
[34:27] I don't want to commit sin against God
[34:31] I don't want to go against his word I
[34:33] don't want to go against his desire I
[34:34] want to be pleasing to him in all things
[34:36] and so I give unto Caesar what is
[34:38] Caesar's because of him amen I I do what
[34:41] I do because of him not because I'm
[34:44] afraid of what people think or I'm
[34:45] afraid of what might happen amen those
[34:48] are all realities in the life we live in
[34:50] but the greatest reality of all is if no
[34:53] one will ever know if no one will ever
[34:55] see and there'll never be any
[34:57] repercussions I want to do it because
[34:59] God is gone and I love God and I do not
[35:01] want to sin against God
[35:04] that's the bride he's looking for him
[35:06] Acts Chapter 13 Verse 21.
[35:13] it says and afterward they desired a
[35:15] king
[35:16] and God gave unto them Saul the son of
[35:18] kiss a man of the tribe of Benjamin by
[35:21] the space of 40 years and when he had
[35:23] removed him he raised up unto them David
[35:26] to be their King to whom also he gave
[35:29] testimony and said I have found David
[35:31] the son of Jesse a man after mine own
[35:33] heart which shall fulfill all my will
[35:37] amen how would you like for God to speak
[35:40] of you
[35:41] and say this is a man after mine own
[35:44] heart
[35:46] and
[35:48] David says he writes in Psalms 119 he
[35:51] says Thy word have I hid in my heart
[35:52] that I might not sin against thee
[35:56] he he hid the word in his heart because
[35:59] he didn't want to sin against God
[36:01] [Music]
[36:03] but we know that that David failed and
[36:06] we picked this up in second Samuel let's
[36:07] turn there together II Samuel
[36:10] we know the issue with Bathsheba and
[36:13] Uriah and the failure and adultery of
[36:16] David
[36:19] and then Nathan comes to expose David's
[36:23] sin
[36:25] in second Samuel chapter 12 verse 13
[36:27] after the sin is exposed
[36:31] this is David's response II Samuel 12
[36:34] and 13.
[36:36] and David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[36:40] against the Lord
[36:43] and Nathan said unto David the Lord also
[36:45] hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die
[36:50] David didn't say I have sinned against
[36:52] Uriah
[36:54] I have sinned against joab because he
[36:56] made joab
[36:57] do the Dirty Work
[36:59] I have sinned against Bathsheba all
[37:01] those things are true
[37:03] he sinned against Bathsheba he sinned
[37:06] against his people he sinned against
[37:07] joab he sinned against Uriah but What
[37:10] mattered most to David is I have sinned
[37:13] against the Lord
[37:14] that's what grieved him the most and
[37:16] that's what hurt him the most and that's
[37:17] What mattered the most and when David
[37:19] was able to repent and acknowledge his
[37:21] sin against the Lord as the Lord had put
[37:24] away his sin
[37:25] and so there's unique people in the
[37:28] Bible that are after God's Own Heart are
[37:31] are
[37:32] god-conscious and are motivated by a
[37:35] love for God we see so many other people
[37:37] in the Bible in the world that are
[37:39] motivated by so many other things
[37:42] but they're God's children were
[37:43] motivated by a love for God and a desire
[37:46] to please God
[37:49] we we spoke Sunday about Abraham in
[37:52] Isaiah 41 8 it says but thou Israel are
[37:55] my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the
[37:58] Seed of Abraham my friend
[38:01] we read that scripture on Sunday and
[38:03] talked about how wonderful it would be
[38:04] for God to call you his friend
[38:07] how wonderful to be if God would say
[38:09] Chad is my friend and especially if he's
[38:12] talking to somebody else you know and
[38:14] you overhear it and God says Chad is my
[38:16] friend all of a sudden something happens
[38:18] on the inside but that's how he spoke
[38:20] about Abraham Abraham God says my friend
[38:24] and so Abraham is a unique individual
[38:26] and and in Genesis 18 I'm not going to
[38:30] turn there but I'm just going to quote
[38:32] it to you Genesis 18 17 after God comes
[38:35] and visits Abraham on the planes of
[38:36] memory they take a walk and they stroll
[38:39] together and it says and the Lord said
[38:41] shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[38:43] which I do
[38:45] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[38:47] a great and mighty nation in all the
[38:49] nations of Earth shall be blessed in him
[38:50] he goes on to say and I know him and
[38:52] he'll raise his children after him and
[38:55] and so God says shall I hide from
[38:57] Abraham that thing which I do why will
[39:00] God not hide from Abraham he gave a list
[39:03] of qualities because I know he'll be a
[39:05] great mighty nation why will he be in
[39:07] the great mighty nation because God said
[39:09] he would be a great and mighty nation
[39:11] but he can't hide from Abraham the thing
[39:14] that'll do because Abraham is his friend
[39:17] and when God looked at when Jesus talked
[39:19] to his disciples in John 12 well John 15
[39:22] will turn to this one John 15.
[39:27] John 15 and 13.
[39:35] in the Gospel of John chapter 15 verse
[39:37] 13 Jesus says greater love hath no man
[39:40] than this that a man laid down his life
[39:42] for his friends ye are my friends if you
[39:44] do whatsoever I command you
[39:46] henceforth I tell you not I call you not
[39:49] servants for the servant knoweth not
[39:51] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[39:53] you friends for all things that I have
[39:56] heard of my father I have made known
[39:58] unto you Jesus said I won't call you
[40:00] servants because the servant doesn't
[40:01] know what his master is doing I will
[40:03] call you friend because I've told you
[40:05] everything now now Elohim in a body of
[40:09] flesh is walking with his friend Abraham
[40:11] and he's getting ready to destroy Sodom
[40:13] and Gomorrah and he says shall I hide
[40:16] from Abraham the thing which I'll do he
[40:19] can't hide from Abraham because
[40:20] Abraham's his friend amen and and so God
[40:24] is manifesting his his friendship with
[40:27] Abraham through Revelation because he'll
[40:29] not hide from his friend the thing that
[40:31] he is about to do
[40:33] man let's turn to Daniel
[40:35] chapter 9.
[40:43] so it's as if the Friendship of God
[40:48] to Abraham and the friendship of God to
[40:51] the disciples amen would would be
[40:55] confirmed by a revelation by their their
[40:59] lack of servanthood because they're not
[41:03] in ignorance anymore because there's a
[41:05] there's a deeper relationship than that
[41:07] of servant and master the relationship
[41:09] is going into the Realms of Revelation
[41:11] where I now begin to share with you what
[41:13] I'm about to do I now begin to share
[41:15] with you what's in my heart and as he's
[41:17] bringing this Revelation and this
[41:19] understanding the relationship is
[41:21] different now than servant now it's a
[41:23] relationship a friend
[41:26] in Daniel chapter 9.
[41:29] look at verse 21.
[41:35] he says yeah while I was speaking in
[41:38] prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had
[41:41] seen in the vision at the beginning
[41:43] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[41:45] about the time of the evening oblation
[41:47] and he informed me and talked with me
[41:50] and said oh Daniel I am now come forth
[41:52] to give thee skill and understanding
[41:56] at the beginning of thy supplication the
[41:59] Commandment came forth and I came to
[42:01] show thee Thou Art greatly beloved
[42:03] therefore understand the matter and
[42:06] consider the vision
[42:08] he says now I've come to give you
[42:11] understanding I I Daniel I've come forth
[42:14] to give these skill and understanding of
[42:17] diverse at the beginning of thy
[42:19] supplication the Commandment came forth
[42:21] and I came to show thee for thou art
[42:24] greatly beloved I came to give you the
[42:28] answer to your prayer because you're
[42:30] greatly beloved I came to give you the
[42:33] Revelation you're seeking for because
[42:35] you're greatly beloved you're not the
[42:37] servant you're the greatly beloved amen
[42:39] and because you're the greatly beloved
[42:41] I'm coming to bring you this Revelation
[42:44] amen I've come to give you skill and
[42:46] understanding I was sent to you to show
[42:49] you because you're greatly greatly
[42:51] beloved
[42:53] therefore therefore because you're
[42:56] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[42:58] matter and consider the vision so God
[43:02] Amen whom he loves he Reveals His
[43:04] mystery to you amen who's greatly
[43:07] beloved of the Lord is the one who's
[43:09] when he's earnestly seeking in prayer in
[43:11] the right time according to the word
[43:13] when he sees the time approaching he
[43:16] begins to pray and make supplication and
[43:18] as soon as he dies God dispatches
[43:20] Gabriel to go and bring him a message
[43:22] and he says I've come to give you skill
[43:24] and understanding I've come to show you
[43:26] the thing you're asking for because Thou
[43:29] Art greatly beloved now therefore hear
[43:31] and understand amen it came not because
[43:34] he was despised not because he was a
[43:36] servant not because he was rejected but
[43:38] because he was greatly beloved
[43:42] so the sign of being greatly beloved for
[43:44] Daniel was the revelation of the mystery
[43:48] let's look at chapter 10
[43:52] verse 11.
[43:56] chapter 10 verse 11 and he said unto me
[43:58] oh Daniel a man greatly beloved
[44:01] understand the words that I speak unto
[44:03] thee and stand upright For unto thee and
[44:05] my now sin and when he had spoken these
[44:07] words this word unto me I stood
[44:10] trembling
[44:12] So Daniel is a man greatly beloved
[44:17] so now understand the words
[44:19] verse 18.
[44:21] Then There came again and touched me one
[44:23] light the appearance of a man and he
[44:25] strengthened me and said oh man greatly
[44:28] beloved fear not peace be unto thee be
[44:30] strong yea be strong and when he had
[44:32] spoken unto me I was strengthened and
[44:34] said let my Lord speak for thou has
[44:36] strengthened me
[44:38] Daniel received the Revelation because
[44:42] he was greatly beloved
[44:44] let's go to Luke chapter 1.
[44:55] chapter 1 verse 26.
[45:06] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[45:08] was sent from God into a city of Galilee
[45:11] named Nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a
[45:14] man whose name was Joseph of the House
[45:16] of David and the virgin's name was Mary
[45:18] and the angel came in unto her and said
[45:21] hail Thou Art highly favored
[45:24] the Lord is with thee blessed art thou
[45:27] among women
[45:29] when she saw him she was troubled at his
[45:31] saying and casted her mind what men are
[45:33] salutation this should be and the angel
[45:36] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[45:38] Hast found favor with God and behold
[45:40] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[45:42] bring forth a son and shall call his
[45:45] name Jesus
[45:47] so when it was time to bring a
[45:49] revelation of the Fulfillment of Isaiah
[45:52] chapter 7 the angel came to the Virgin
[45:55] Mary and says behold Thou Art highly
[45:58] favored amen Thou Art highly favored
[46:01] thou has found favor with God Amen what
[46:04] did what did Mary do to obtain this
[46:07] favor
[46:09] what did Daniel do to be greatly beloved
[46:12] amen Daniel was greatly beloved but what
[46:14] did he do all that we know that he was
[46:16] doing was praying and serving God and
[46:18] obeying God but he was greatly belonged
[46:20] Mary we have we have no we have no
[46:23] knowledge of her actions of her Deeds of
[46:25] what she did to earn this favor with God
[46:27] because she didn't do anything to earn
[46:30] this favor with God when God spoke the
[46:32] word through Isaiah's lips a virgin
[46:34] shall conceive God knew that it was Mary
[46:36] amen God knew who it would be she was
[46:39] favored from before the foundation of
[46:41] the world she was highly favored before
[46:43] before the foundation of the world and
[46:46] because she was highly favored because
[46:47] she was greatly beloved because it was
[46:49] the right time and season she was the
[46:51] right kind of person the angel came to
[46:53] her and revealed the mystery to her that
[46:56] now is the time of the Fulfillment of
[46:57] Isaiah chapter 7. amen it didn't go to
[47:00] the servants it didn't go to those who
[47:02] who were not highly favored but it came
[47:05] to her amen
[47:08] and so we know that this is God's method
[47:12] let's look at Ephesians chapter 1.
[47:20] Ephesians chapter 1.
[47:24] and verse 3.
[47:30] it says in Ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be
[47:32] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[47:34] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[47:36] spiritual blessings and Heavenly places
[47:38] in Christ according as he hath chosen Us
[47:41] in him before the foundation of the
[47:43] world that we should be holy and Without
[47:45] Blame before him in love
[47:48] having predestinated us into the
[47:50] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[47:52] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:55] of his will to the praise of the glory
[47:57] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[48:00] accepted in the Beloved
[48:03] he have made us we have not made
[48:05] ourselves but he hath made us accepted
[48:09] this word accepted is the exact same
[48:12] word that the angel spoke to Mary when
[48:14] he said thou are highly favored
[48:17] to make accepted and to be highly
[48:19] favored is the same thing she was highly
[48:21] favored we've been made accepted amen
[48:23] when were we made accepted we were
[48:25] accepted before the foundation were when
[48:27] we were chosen in him before the
[48:29] foundation of the world and now he has
[48:31] made us accepted in the Beloved the word
[48:34] beloved is agape it means love God's
[48:38] love
[48:38] we've been accepted
[48:41] in the love of God when we were accepted
[48:44] it says now let's go back and read the
[48:46] verse 4 again according as he hath
[48:48] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[48:50] of the world that we should be holy and
[48:53] Without Blame before him in love
[48:56] God loved us before amen
[48:59] God loved us before and he hath made us
[49:03] highly favored
[49:06] he's made us accepted amen the the to
[49:10] put his grace upon us
[49:12] because he loves us
[49:15] and because he loves us like he loved
[49:19] Daniel because he loves us like he loves
[49:21] Mary when we in our turn come to the
[49:24] right place to the right season with the
[49:27] right desire amen he will also come with
[49:29] an angel messenger and bring us a
[49:31] revelation amen because that's what he
[49:34] gives to the highly favored to the to
[49:36] the greatly beloved amen
[49:38] not to the servant the servant doesn't
[49:40] know what his master's doing amen and
[49:43] the friend has been told all that the
[49:45] father's doing amen the the greatly
[49:47] beloved of God Amen is receiving the
[49:50] revelation of the hour amen because they
[49:53] are highly favored
[49:55] let's go to Second Thessalonians chapter
[49:57] 2.
[50:07] II Thessalonians 2 and 13.
[50:13] but we are bound to give thanks all we
[50:15] to God for you Brethren beloved to the
[50:17] Lord because God hath from the beginning
[50:19] chosen you to Salvation through
[50:22] sanctification of spirit and belief of
[50:26] the truth
[50:29] so
[50:30] from the beginning
[50:33] from the beginning of what from the
[50:35] beginning of the beginning
[50:37] from the beginning he has chosen you to
[50:40] Salvation through sanctification of the
[50:43] spirit and belief of the truth
[50:49] where unto he called you by Our Gospel
[50:51] to the obtaining of the glory of our
[50:54] Lord Jesus Christ
[50:56] so they were chosen to Salvation through
[50:59] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[51:02] of the truth and we are chosen from
[51:04] before the foundation of the world to
[51:06] Salvation through the same means through
[51:07] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[51:10] of the truth
[51:11] so if it's going to take belief of the
[51:14] truth for salvation then God is going to
[51:17] have to bring truth and he's going to
[51:19] have to bring a revelation of that truth
[51:21] because from the beginning he chose us
[51:23] unto salvation through sanctification
[51:26] the spirit which he must Supply and
[51:28] belief of the truth and he's the one who
[51:30] has the truth
[51:32] so he holds the elements of our
[51:34] Salvation sanctification by his spirit
[51:37] and belief of his truth which is his
[51:39] word amen and so
[51:42] so
[51:43] we have to have the spirit and we have
[51:47] to have his truth but we have to believe
[51:49] his truth
[51:51] like the Pharisees and Sadducees they
[51:53] had the truth because the truth was
[51:55] contained in the Scrolls they had the
[51:57] scroll so potentially they had the truth
[51:59] but because they had no Revelation on
[52:01] what Moses wrote they could not worship
[52:03] Him in spirit and in truth amen they did
[52:06] not have they held the truth but they
[52:09] did not have the truth amen because the
[52:11] truth was not revealed to them because
[52:13] the truth is revealed to the greatly
[52:14] Beloved the highly favored
[52:16] [Music]
[52:19] in the Samaritan Church age of the
[52:21] church age book The Prophet says that is
[52:23] what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3 and he
[52:26] quotes Malachi chapter 1 verse 1 to 3
[52:29] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[52:30] Israel by Malachi I I have loved you
[52:33] saith the Lord yet we say where in hast
[52:36] thou loved us was not he saw Jacob's
[52:38] brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob
[52:40] and I hated Esau and laid his mountain
[52:42] in his Heritage waste for the dragons of
[52:44] the Wilderness you see they could not
[52:47] figure out God's love
[52:49] they thought that love meant no
[52:51] suffering they thought that love meant a
[52:52] baby with parental care but God said
[52:55] that his love was elective love the
[52:57] proof of his love is election that no
[53:00] matter what happened his love was proven
[53:03] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[53:05] unto salvation because God hath chosen
[53:08] you to Salvation through sanctification
[53:10] of the spirit and belief of the truth
[53:13] Amen brother man quotes that out of uh
[53:16] II Thessalonians
[53:19] so now we we find out that the the
[53:22] evidence of God's love they
[53:24] misunderstood God's love because they
[53:26] were trying to equate God's love by
[53:29] whether Goods or bad things happened to
[53:30] them
[53:32] and so because bad things happen to the
[53:34] nation of Israel they were saying
[53:36] wherein hast thou loved us we're not
[53:38] seeing evidence of your love and and God
[53:41] points them to evidence and the evidence
[53:43] was have not I chosen Jacob and have not
[53:45] I hated Esau that's the evidence that's
[53:49] the evidence of my love so the evidence
[53:51] of my love is an election that I chose
[53:53] you in him before the foundation of the
[53:55] world that you might be perfect Before
[53:57] Me In Love
[53:59] I loved you before and I chose you
[54:01] before that's the evidence of God's love
[54:05] that's why we cannot judge God's love
[54:07] based off answered prayers based off
[54:10] healings based off signs based off
[54:12] whether good things are difficult things
[54:14] happen in our life because we know that
[54:16] God allows good things and difficult
[54:18] things for character moding also for a
[54:21] display of his character amen that God
[54:23] sometimes God must crush a rose to get
[54:25] the fragrance out and sometimes God must
[54:28] let Trials come in our life to get the
[54:30] fragrance of Jesus Christ the perfume to
[54:32] go out that it can have an effect on
[54:34] other people
[54:35] so we cannot judge God's love based off
[54:38] how many good things or how many bad
[54:40] things are happening in my life his love
[54:43] was Secure before the foundation of the
[54:45] world when he chose us in him before the
[54:47] foundation of the world
[54:49] that is the evidence of God's love
[54:52] the fact that we were chosen unto
[54:53] salvation
[54:55] through sanctification of the spirit and
[54:57] belief of the truth
[54:58] that's a key scripture hold on to that
[55:00] and don't forget that
[55:04] then he goes a little further in the
[55:07] smyrnan church age he's still speaking
[55:09] of the same subject
[55:10] so the cloudy skies and the storms of
[55:13] life are no signs of God's disapproval
[55:15] neither are bright skies and Still
[55:17] Waters the signs of his love and
[55:19] approval
[55:20] his approval of any us any of us is only
[55:23] in the Beloved
[55:26] his love is elective which he had for us
[55:28] before the foundation of the world does
[55:31] he love us oh yes but how shall we know
[55:34] we shall know because he said so
[55:37] and listen this is the part I want to
[55:39] focus on
[55:40] and manifested that he did love us for
[55:44] he brought us unto himself and gave us
[55:47] of a spirit placing us as Sons
[55:51] so how do we know he love us because he
[55:53] chose us before the foundation of the
[55:55] world how do we know he loves us because
[55:57] he said so that's how we know he loves
[55:59] us but how does he manifest that love to
[56:02] us amen he manifests that love and
[56:05] listen
[56:06] we shall know because he said so and
[56:10] manifested that he did love us for he
[56:14] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[56:17] Spirit placing us as Sons so what is the
[56:21] manifestation of this elective love the
[56:24] manifestation is he drew us to himself
[56:27] and he gave us of his Spirit placing us
[56:30] the sons amen because we have been we
[56:34] have we have been chosen amen before
[56:36] unto salvation through sanctification of
[56:39] the spirit and belief of the truth
[56:42] so how does he manifest that love he
[56:45] manifests that love by by giving us
[56:47] everything we ask for and making only
[56:49] Miracles show up in our life and never
[56:51] letting a trial come our way no he
[56:54] manifests that elective Love by drawing
[56:56] us unto himself and giving us of his
[56:59] spirit
[57:01] whether good things happen or bad things
[57:03] happen he manifest his elective Love by
[57:06] drawing us unto himself
[57:09] let's go to Jeremiah 31.
[57:20] I'd like to just go on records saying
[57:22] that the devil is a liar
[57:25] and he constantly uses the same lies
[57:29] and the same tactics to try to trip up
[57:31] God's children but the word of God is
[57:34] forever true amen
[57:36] and if we have to to believe the devil's
[57:39] lie that because we're in a cycle of
[57:42] negative or negative things are
[57:44] happening in our life or it seems like
[57:46] God didn't answer our prayer or anything
[57:48] like that that somehow is equated to the
[57:51] amount of love that God has for us then
[57:53] we will have to Discount the Apostle
[57:55] Paul is being loved by God
[57:58] because when you start to read about the
[58:00] life of the Apostle Paul amen he was
[58:02] rejected of his brother and he was
[58:04] chased from City to City he was stoned
[58:06] how many times he was left for dead he
[58:08] was Shipwrecked he spent a night and a
[58:09] day in the Deep he has a whole rap list
[58:12] of negative things that happened to him
[58:14] he was forsaken by his friends demons
[58:16] turned his back on him how many he he he
[58:19] had a he had a a a long-term uh
[58:22] long-standing illness that he was never
[58:25] healed of
[58:27] so if we have to take that measuring
[58:29] stick to measure then we have to measure
[58:31] Paul as not being very loved but I would
[58:34] say Paul was greatly beloved of the Lord
[58:36] because God came to him himself amen and
[58:40] called him by his own voice and by the
[58:42] pillar of fire who was Jesus Christ
[58:45] himself speaking to Paul calling Paul
[58:48] unto himself amen what what was that
[58:50] that was the manifestation of his
[58:52] elective love when he came on the scene
[58:54] and he called the Apostle Paul unto
[58:57] himself took him into Arabia and
[59:00] revealed himself to him for three and a
[59:01] half years that was the evidence that
[59:04] was the manifestation of his love his
[59:06] love was Secure before the foundation of
[59:08] the world he was loved because it was
[59:09] elective love God's love was never
[59:11] changing but God manifest that love when
[59:14] he met him on the road to Damascus and
[59:16] say Paul Saul Saul why does thou
[59:18] persecute against why did why does thou
[59:21] kick against the bricks why do you
[59:22] persecute me
[59:25] said who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom you
[59:27] persecute and he began to draw Saul to
[59:30] himself
[59:31] and he and he gave Saul his spirit and
[59:34] he began to reveal to him the word
[59:37] that was the manifestation of his
[59:39] elective life
[59:42] no matter how many rejections Paul went
[59:45] through how many stonings how many
[59:47] beatings how many stripes how many
[59:49] Shipwrecked how many a night and day in
[59:51] the Deep how many times he was hungry
[59:53] how many times he was naked how many
[59:55] times he was in prison how many times he
[59:57] locked and had need how many times he
[1:00:00] was rejected by those who used to walk
[1:00:02] with him no matter what Demas said about
[1:00:04] him none of that mattered because God
[1:00:06] already manifested this elective love to
[1:00:09] Paul because he drew Paul to himself and
[1:00:12] he gave Paul of his spirit and he
[1:00:13] revealed himself to Paul
[1:00:17] oh if we could just be so sure of his
[1:00:20] love at the manifestation of his love to
[1:00:22] us because we didn't draw ourselves to
[1:00:24] this message we had no power Amen to
[1:00:26] come God found us and he drew us to
[1:00:29] himself
[1:00:30] by his own work he gave us of his own
[1:00:32] spirit amen and he revealed his own word
[1:00:35] to us and there was something within us
[1:00:37] that he placed there before the
[1:00:38] foundation of the world that could
[1:00:40] recognize the truth of what he's
[1:00:41] speaking because we were ordained before
[1:00:44] to Salvation through sanctification of
[1:00:46] the spirit and belief of the truth
[1:00:49] so that when he would begin to reveal
[1:00:51] the truth there was a receptor inside
[1:00:53] that could receive that truth because it
[1:00:55] was necessary for our salvation
[1:00:59] and that's the manifestation of his
[1:01:02] elective love
[1:01:04] now in Jeremiah 31
[1:01:07] verse 3.
[1:01:12] it says the Lord hath appeared of old
[1:01:14] unto me saying yea I have loved thee
[1:01:18] with an everlasting love
[1:01:20] therefore with loving kindness have I
[1:01:23] drawn thee
[1:01:25] I have love thee with an Everlasting
[1:01:27] Love Therefore with loving kindness have
[1:01:30] I drawn Thee the Everlasting Love was
[1:01:33] the motivation behind the drawing
[1:01:36] John 6 44 says no man can come to me
[1:01:40] except the Father which has sent me draw
[1:01:43] him
[1:01:45] it's impossible
[1:01:47] when
[1:01:48] when we look at John 3 16.
[1:01:52] says for God so loved the world
[1:01:55] that's also God's love
[1:01:58] you know God's love is not just limited
[1:02:00] to his elect
[1:02:03] God loved the world
[1:02:05] and he sent his only begotten son
[1:02:09] but God also has an elective love for
[1:02:12] the bride
[1:02:13] so he is a general love and he has an
[1:02:15] elective love
[1:02:17] so God's love was sent into the world
[1:02:22] but his elective love was expressed
[1:02:25] through Peter when he says who do men
[1:02:28] say that I am
[1:02:30] he says Thou Art Christ the son of the
[1:02:32] Living God he said blessed art thou
[1:02:34] Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath
[1:02:35] not revealed this to you but my Father
[1:02:37] which is in heaven has revealed the
[1:02:39] thing to you his General love sent
[1:02:42] Christ into the world his elective love
[1:02:44] gave a revelation to Peter to recognize
[1:02:46] who this was
[1:02:49] his General love amen he says in Matthew
[1:02:54] 5 let's turn to Matthew 5.
[1:02:57] let's just read this together
[1:03:03] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:03:06] verse 44.
[1:03:10] it says but I say unto you love your
[1:03:12] enemies
[1:03:15] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:03:17] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:03:19] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:03:21] you
[1:03:22] that you may be children of your father
[1:03:24] which is in heaven for he maketh his son
[1:03:26] to rise on the evil and on the good and
[1:03:28] sendeth Reign on the just and on the
[1:03:30] unjust
[1:03:32] he's instructing you to love the way
[1:03:34] your father loves
[1:03:36] love your enemy
[1:03:38] because God loves his but this is not
[1:03:42] the same as his elective love
[1:03:44] this is his General love and in his love
[1:03:47] he allows the son to continue to come up
[1:03:49] he takes care of people he feeds and
[1:03:52] nourishes multitudes of people how many
[1:03:55] people were healed amen when Jesus was
[1:03:57] on Earth how many people were fed when
[1:03:59] the multitudes were fed with the fish
[1:04:01] and the bread amen how many people were
[1:04:04] recipients of a general love but how
[1:04:06] many were recipients of the
[1:04:07] manifestation of elective love amen
[1:04:11] so God tells us to have his love to love
[1:04:14] our enemy to love our neighbor to love
[1:04:16] mankind to do good to love amen that's
[1:04:19] part of the the second commandment
[1:04:22] that's likened to the first commandment
[1:04:23] to have love but the expression of God's
[1:04:26] elective love is when God draws you to
[1:04:29] himself and gives you of his spirit amen
[1:04:32] this is his elective love from before
[1:04:34] the foundation of the world
[1:04:36] so he sees that that God he allows the
[1:04:40] rain to fall on the good and the bad on
[1:04:43] the just and the unjust he he provides
[1:04:45] crops he provides food he provides
[1:04:47] everything he keeps the world uh
[1:04:50] sustained amen this is God's love amen
[1:04:53] but his elective love does more than
[1:04:56] feed you and clothe you and make sure
[1:04:58] you're okay and feed you and he feeds
[1:05:01] the multitudes and heal you when there's
[1:05:02] a Healing Ministry on the earth amen his
[1:05:05] elective love does more than that amen
[1:05:07] his General love will will feed in water
[1:05:11] the just and the unjust
[1:05:13] his General love will heal all those
[1:05:16] that will come in respect to him and
[1:05:18] respect his word can be healed
[1:05:20] how many hundreds of thousands possibly
[1:05:23] more than that were healed in the
[1:05:25] ministry of of the prophet of God Amen
[1:05:28] they were healed that's God's General
[1:05:30] love amen how many were fed the day
[1:05:33] Jesus broke the bread how many were
[1:05:35] cared for by my by Christian works and
[1:05:37] Ministries all over the world Amen but
[1:05:40] that's God's General love that's not the
[1:05:42] manifestation of his elective love
[1:05:45] God allows uh
[1:05:48] um times of Peace God allows the the
[1:05:51] seasons to continue God allows the Earth
[1:05:53] to continue to move in on its axis he
[1:05:56] keeps gravity in place he keeps all the
[1:05:58] laws of physics moving so that mankind
[1:06:00] can prosper and have health and God Amen
[1:06:03] it was God who allowed man to discover
[1:06:05] penicillin
[1:06:08] it was God who allowed man to have
[1:06:10] wisdom to to have devices for healing
[1:06:13] and have doctors and all these other
[1:06:14] things that was the goodness of God that
[1:06:17] was the General love of God for Humanity
[1:06:19] so just because God provides for you
[1:06:22] food and water and shelter and healing
[1:06:25] and all these things that that's what
[1:06:28] the general love of God will provide for
[1:06:30] anybody
[1:06:32] but the elective love of God is Manifest
[1:06:35] in a very specific way amen the elected
[1:06:39] love of God is Manifest in him drawing
[1:06:42] you to himself amen so that you can walk
[1:06:45] in the light as he is in the light he's
[1:06:48] not drawing you to a dispensation he's
[1:06:51] not drawing you to where he was but the
[1:06:53] but the but the manifestation of the
[1:06:55] elective love of God Is He will draw you
[1:06:58] to where he is amen and he is always the
[1:07:01] word made manifest in the day and age
[1:07:04] that you live and that's the elective
[1:07:06] love of God will draw you to himself
[1:07:08] which is the message of the hour
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:15] in the Feast of trumpets the prophet
[1:07:17] says now how how he shall appear in the
[1:07:20] last days is to bring the people back to
[1:07:22] the word so that the bride will know her
[1:07:24] husband know her mate the revealed word
[1:07:27] that's why this has to happen her
[1:07:30] husband is the revealed word he's the
[1:07:32] one that's drawing her to him
[1:07:36] he's drawing he's drawing by his
[1:07:40] elective love he's manifesting that love
[1:07:42] by drawing his bride to himself and he
[1:07:46] has to draw her to where he is currently
[1:07:50] and he's the revealed word
[1:07:54] and the message Christ is the mystery of
[1:07:56] God revealed Prophet says notice
[1:07:59] secondly the manifested Christ in you
[1:08:01] the hope of glory that great manifested
[1:08:04] God in Christ now Christ manifested in
[1:08:06] you he said look what was once God's
[1:08:09] Great secret great mysterious Secret in
[1:08:12] his mind is now put in the hearts of the
[1:08:15] Believers
[1:08:17] God had a great Secret
[1:08:20] and Daniel's day and that secret was
[1:08:22] tied up in Jeremiah 70 weeks
[1:08:26] and God was not going to take his great
[1:08:28] mystery secret of Daniel 70 weeks and he
[1:08:32] was not going to put it out there in the
[1:08:35] heart of all mankind like he does when
[1:08:36] he sends the rain
[1:08:38] when he allows the wheat to come up when
[1:08:40] he allows the sun to continue to shine
[1:08:42] amen when he allows peace and prosperity
[1:08:45] to move when he brings up righteous
[1:08:47] governments and topples unrighteous
[1:08:49] governments that's his General Life he's
[1:08:51] not going to take the secret of Jeremiah
[1:08:54] 70 weeks and he's not going to put it
[1:08:56] out there like rain over the wheat and
[1:08:58] the terrors
[1:08:59] but what he will do is he will put it in
[1:09:02] the heart of the greatly beloved
[1:09:04] and that's why the angel came to Daniel
[1:09:07] to put it in the heart it was greatly
[1:09:09] beloved
[1:09:12] he said now
[1:09:14] what was once God's
[1:09:16] great Secret in his mind is now put in
[1:09:18] the hearts of the Believers
[1:09:20] that is the body of Christ what was
[1:09:22] God's once great Secret in his mind
[1:09:24] before the foundation of the world has
[1:09:26] now made manifest think of it

[1:09:31] it the way I ought to and I'm sure you
[1:09:33] don't see but God's great mystery what
[1:09:35] the Eternal God had as a mystery has now
[1:09:38] been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given
[1:09:41] right down to his church what was once
[1:09:43] in God's mind is now in the body of
[1:09:46] Christ Jesus making love to the church
[1:09:48] his bride Whispering secrets to her
[1:09:52] why is he Whispering secrets to her
[1:09:54] because she's highly favored
[1:09:56] because she's greatly beloved he doesn't
[1:09:58] whisper these secrets amen he doesn't
[1:10:01] whisper these secrets generally he
[1:10:04] whispers these secrets specifically
[1:10:06] oh it may be preached generally but when
[1:10:09] it's preached generally it's preached as
[1:10:11] a mystery and goes over the top of the
[1:10:12] head but it's revealed as a whispering
[1:10:15] secrets into the heart of his elect amen

[1:10:39] now look by having the revelation of his
[1:10:42] secret made known to them by his grace
[1:10:44] oh the grace of God that Grace is his
[1:10:48] love that Grace is his elective love
[1:10:51] amen and having the Revelation the
[1:10:53] secret made known to them by his love it
[1:10:56] only comes to the recipients of his
[1:10:58] elective love amen
[1:11:00] God does not make the revelation of the
[1:11:02] secret known in the general way of his
[1:11:05] General goodness to all mankind but this
[1:11:08] is God's secret of his Revelation that
[1:11:11] he only makes known to the greatly
[1:11:13] beloved to the highly favored
[1:11:19] again in Christ as the mystery of God
[1:11:21] revealed he says but all this mystery is
[1:11:23] revealed only as he promised to his
[1:11:26] bride
[1:11:28] this mystery this threefold purpose that
[1:11:31] he had in the back part of his mind to
[1:11:34] gain preeminence in the man which he did
[1:11:35] in Christ Jesus preeminence in a body
[1:11:38] which he is doing now through the bride
[1:11:41] and a restoration Back to Eden
[1:11:44] this great mystery is revealed only as
[1:11:47] he promised to the bride
[1:11:51] in future home he says now you say well
[1:11:54] look at this priest wasn't he a son of
[1:11:57] God
[1:11:58] it proved he wasn't he couldn't
[1:12:00] recognize what did he say I believe the
[1:12:03] Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the
[1:12:05] expressed word of the hour
[1:12:08] he only had an intellectual learning
[1:12:10] from some group that he had been back
[1:12:11] before him
[1:12:13] and it's the same thing today see I know
[1:12:16] that's strong but it's the truth
[1:12:19] there was the word as spoken exactly for
[1:12:22] that day and he yet he was a scholar yet
[1:12:25] he was a renowned person but he could
[1:12:27] not recognize it why no matter how
[1:12:30] scholar he was anything like that he
[1:12:33] still didn't have representation of
[1:12:35] predestination
[1:12:37] only the predestined it will only be the
[1:12:40] one who does it only can be
[1:12:43] why because he was they were chosen in
[1:12:45] him before that they might be perfect in
[1:12:47] his life
[1:12:49] they're the recipients of his love
[1:12:51] they're the object of his love they're
[1:12:52] the greatly beloved of the lord they're
[1:12:54] the only ones that predestinate is the
[1:12:56] only ones that can receive the
[1:12:58] revelation of the word
[1:13:01] this priest
[1:13:02] thought he was the son of God thought he
[1:13:05] was studying the word thought he was
[1:13:07] believing the word and he was to a
[1:13:09] certain extent he was believing a a
[1:13:12] certain level of the word a certain
[1:13:13] layer to the word of God because the
[1:13:16] word of God is written in layers
[1:13:18] you can read a layer and that layer is
[1:13:20] fine that layer is true it's every bit
[1:13:22] the truth you can catch the history of
[1:13:25] the of the Jewish church you can find
[1:13:27] out amen when they came out of Exodus
[1:13:29] how they came out of Exodus what
[1:13:31] happened when they went into the
[1:13:32] promised land where they failed God and
[1:13:35] it's every bit the truth and it's all
[1:13:36] profitable and beneficial but you can go
[1:13:38] another layer deeper amen which the
[1:13:41] prophet of God could take us deeper and
[1:13:43] he could show us that that first Exodus
[1:13:44] was the type of the second Nexus which
[1:13:46] is the type of the Third Exodus amen and
[1:13:48] then then Peter can pick that up and
[1:13:50] Paul can pick that up and say these
[1:13:53] things that went they went through is
[1:13:54] for our example amen
[1:13:56] so you can go layer by layer and the
[1:13:59] priest on a certain level amen had the
[1:14:02] word of God Amen but he did not have
[1:14:05] that word of God that was being made
[1:14:07] manifest in his day because that word of
[1:14:09] God that was being made manifest in his
[1:14:11] day was Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:14:13] dwelling in flesh right in front of him
[1:14:16] and he had the paper but he didn't have
[1:14:18] the word amen and he didn't have
[1:14:20] representation of predestination so
[1:14:23] there was no way no matter how no matter
[1:14:27] what many how many miracles he saw no
[1:14:29] matter how much he heard Jesus preach
[1:14:31] and even if he got to sit in on one of
[1:14:33] the explanations that the disciples got
[1:14:35] it would never register because he
[1:14:37] didn't have representation of
[1:14:39] predestination
[1:14:41] yeah but the woman at the well had a
[1:14:43] representation of predestination and
[1:14:46] though she didn't have understanding she
[1:14:48] may have been illiterate she didn't have
[1:14:50] the same teaching as the priest she
[1:14:52] didn't have the word memorized she had
[1:14:55] something that the priest could never
[1:14:56] have amen and when Jesus came to her
[1:14:59] what was he doing he was drawing her
[1:15:02] unto himself amen and and what he did is
[1:15:05] he drew her unto himself he gave her the
[1:15:08] word for the day and when she received
[1:15:10] the word for the day amen she was
[1:15:13] quickened amen and when she was quick
[1:15:15] and amen that seed that was within her
[1:15:17] that was a representation of
[1:15:19] predestination came alive and it proved
[1:15:22] who she was and that she was part of the
[1:15:25] elective love of God Amen that she was
[1:15:28] from the beginning chosen in him what
[1:15:30] was the evidence not the general
[1:15:32] goodness of Jesus Christ to heal
[1:15:34] multitudes and to feed multitudes amen
[1:15:37] and to speak words amen but the specific
[1:15:40] revelation nation of the present day
[1:15:43] word to her as an individual was the was
[1:15:46] the manifestation of his elective love
[1:15:52] praise be to God
[1:15:54] how many people went to a campaign and
[1:15:57] saw the Miracles and saw the healings
[1:15:58] and maybe it was healed themselves and
[1:16:00] ate of the bread and fish and saw the
[1:16:02] miracle and went home rejoicing skipping
[1:16:04] singing maybe even writing songs about
[1:16:07] what they had seen and so happy that day
[1:16:09] that did not make them part of the
[1:16:11] elective love
[1:16:13] that made him recipients of God's
[1:16:15] General love
[1:16:17] but what made this woman a recipient
[1:16:20] of God's elective love
[1:16:22] what was the manifestation that she was
[1:16:25] part of that special love and then she
[1:16:27] was that special group of the Beloved
[1:16:29] the greatly beloved and the highly
[1:16:30] favored
[1:16:31] was because he came to her
[1:16:34] and Drew her to himself with the word
[1:16:37] and because she had representation of
[1:16:40] predestination she could believe it
[1:16:47] Ephesians 5.
[1:16:50] let's look at Ephesians 5 together
[1:16:58] in verse 25 Ephesians 5 and 25.
[1:17:03] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:17:05] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:17:07] for him that he might sanctify and
[1:17:09] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[1:17:12] the word
[1:17:13] We Know by the message that he is
[1:17:16] washing his bride by the word
[1:17:19] by the bleeding word the word that was
[1:17:22] made flash that died on Calvary that
[1:17:24] bled for us that same word is present
[1:17:26] today and that same word it still has
[1:17:29] fresh blood life the life of Christ
[1:17:31] flowing from that word amen and it's
[1:17:34] here to cleanse a bride amen how did it
[1:17:37] get here he sent it here amen how did
[1:17:39] you hear about it though Millions have
[1:17:42] heard about it amen millions and
[1:17:44] billions never heard about it
[1:17:46] how was it that you heard about it
[1:17:49] they're none of the multitudes that
[1:17:51] heard about it why is it that you
[1:17:53] received it when others walked away
[1:17:56] amen because God had an elective love
[1:18:00] for his elect and that elect of love he
[1:18:03] was going to manifest did he did he ever
[1:18:05] not love you no he always loved you were
[1:18:07] you ever not greatly beloved you were
[1:18:09] always greatly beloved what did you do
[1:18:10] to become greatly beloved nothing
[1:18:12] because when you were a thought in his
[1:18:14] mind you were greatly beloved amen
[1:18:16] before you were ever manifest outside
[1:18:18] the mind of God you were greatly beloved
[1:18:20] and you were highly favored you didn't
[1:18:22] earn it you didn't move yourself into it
[1:18:24] you didn't do anything to make yourself
[1:18:26] in this position he put you in that
[1:18:28] position so how do you know that you're
[1:18:31] in that position because it's free from
[1:18:33] any of your Works amen it's free from
[1:18:35] your Deeds it's it's done and decided
[1:18:37] without your accomplishments without
[1:18:39] your abilities so how do you know that
[1:18:42] you're in that group because you can't
[1:18:43] do something to get there you can't
[1:18:45] fulfill something keep something obey
[1:18:48] something to put yourself in that
[1:18:49] position how do you know you're there
[1:18:51] you know by this because he drew you to
[1:18:54] himself amen and he is the Living Word
[1:18:57] Allah live today at the message of the
[1:18:59] hour and he came to you and he drew you
[1:19:03] to himself it wasn't you finding him he
[1:19:06] found you it wasn't you choosing him he
[1:19:08] chose you
[1:19:10] he told his disciples you've not chosen
[1:19:12] me but I've chosen you
[1:19:15] and you've never chose God God chose you
[1:19:17] it wasn't amen it wasn't just your lucky
[1:19:20] day when you happen to know somebody at
[1:19:22] work or find a message book or hear
[1:19:24] somebody or grow up in a home that knew
[1:19:26] the message that wasn't you just Struck
[1:19:28] it lucky you just got you were in the
[1:19:30] right place at the right time by chance
[1:19:31] God placed you there amen because he's
[1:19:34] going to draw you to himself amen and
[1:19:36] when he draws you to himself he's going
[1:19:38] to give you of his spirit so that you
[1:19:40] can be saved through sanctification of
[1:19:42] the spirit and belief of the truth then
[1:19:44] if that's what you were chosen to before
[1:19:46] the foundation of the world he had to
[1:19:48] come and give you the truth and you had
[1:19:50] to be able to receive that truth
[1:19:53] amen so how do I know I'm part of the
[1:19:56] greatly beloved because he's drawn me to
[1:19:59] himself
[1:20:02] he's given me of his spirit
[1:20:06] he's given me his word
[1:20:08] and I believe it
[1:20:11] I believe it with no effort
[1:20:13] I believe it without trying I believe it
[1:20:16] when it was inconvenient to believe it
[1:20:19] I believe that on days that it created
[1:20:21] hardship for me to believe it I believed
[1:20:23] it anyways when it caused separation I
[1:20:25] believed it amen when it caused me to
[1:20:27] change my conduct I believe it when it
[1:20:29] brought conviction in my life I believed
[1:20:31] it when it separated me from family I
[1:20:33] believed it how did I believe it it
[1:20:35] wasn't intellectually that I believed it
[1:20:37] it was a sea Gene of God on the inside a
[1:20:40] representation of predestination that
[1:20:42] when he brought the word there was
[1:20:43] something in me that would receive that
[1:20:45] word he brought me to himself and I came
[1:20:48] to him
[1:20:49] and now I know I'm part of the Beloved
[1:20:52] he's made me accepted in the Beloved I'm
[1:20:55] one of the highly favored I'm the one
[1:20:57] who's greatly beloved and if the wheels
[1:20:59] fall off the bus tomorrow and everything
[1:21:01] falls apart nothing has changed in the
[1:21:03] mind of God because he's already
[1:21:05] manifest me as a part of his elective
[1:21:08] love
[1:21:09] I don't need good things to happen to
[1:21:12] know that I'm part of his love I love it
[1:21:14] when good things happen I enjoy the
[1:21:16] blessings of the Lord and he loves to
[1:21:18] bless his children that's absolutely the
[1:21:20] truth but if we put all of our all of
[1:21:23] our faith in who we are based on what's
[1:21:25] happening in our lives amen we're going
[1:21:27] to miss the real manifestation of his
[1:21:29] elective love and that's him drawing you
[1:21:33] to himself
[1:21:35] revealing his word to you and you have a
[1:21:37] capacity to believe it and him giving
[1:21:40] you of his spirit that is what proves
[1:21:43] that you were chosen in him from the
[1:21:45] beginning
[1:21:47] Amen Let The Devil's lies fall to the
[1:21:50] ground they mean nothing in the face of
[1:21:52] the word
[1:21:57] he's washing her
[1:21:59] and the Water by the word
[1:22:01] we're not even washing ourselves
[1:22:05] we're just standing where the word is
[1:22:07] and receiving the word and letting the
[1:22:10] word wash us purifieth make us clean
[1:22:13] we're not cleansing ourselves by
[1:22:15] conducts and deeds the word is cleansing
[1:22:18] us and when we receive the word the life
[1:22:20] of the word comes in us when the life of
[1:22:22] the word comes unto us the word lives
[1:22:24] itself out of us it's a purification
[1:22:26] it's a force it has a life it has Spirit
[1:22:29] the word and the spirit are the same
[1:22:31] thing you receive the word you receive
[1:22:33] the spirit
[1:22:34] then that Spirit of the word lives the
[1:22:37] word out of you and purifies your life
[1:22:40] it's not what we do it's what we yield
[1:22:42] ourselves to it's not a ladder that we
[1:22:44] climb it's a spout that we stay under
[1:22:49] it's not what we attain it's what we
[1:22:51] receive
[1:22:52] so what we yield to and surrender to
[1:22:57] he might sanctify and cleanse it with
[1:22:59] the washing of Water by the word verse
[1:23:01] 27 that he might present it to himself
[1:23:04] that he might present it to himself
[1:23:08] a glorious Church
[1:23:11] I'm trying to be a glorious Church
[1:23:13] forget trying to be a glorious church he
[1:23:15] will present to himself a glorious
[1:23:17] Church how will he do it by the washing
[1:23:19] of the water of the bleeding word in
[1:23:21] this day by the word that he sent he
[1:23:23] when God wanted to unite with the bride
[1:23:26] first he sent a word to purify the bride
[1:23:28] so he could Unite with the bride he did
[1:23:31] it all all we have to do is receive it
[1:23:34] amen amen
[1:23:36] and you can't receive it without a
[1:23:38] receiver
[1:23:39] you can't give yourself a receiver that
[1:23:41] was chosen before the foundation in the
[1:23:43] world that's part of his elective life
[1:23:49] that he might present to himself a
[1:23:51] glorious Church
[1:23:53] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:23:56] thing but that should be holy and
[1:23:59] without blemish
[1:24:02] he wanted to bring us to himself in love
[1:24:06] this is a work of his elective love this
[1:24:09] is the desire of his heart
[1:24:11] our desire is to surrender
[1:24:15] our motivation our desire our love to
[1:24:19] him
[1:24:19] is to surrender into him and let him do
[1:24:23] his work
[1:24:24] to stay in the word to receive the word
[1:24:27] to believe his word to yield to the word
[1:24:29] to obey his word
[1:24:33] and he wants the church to be without
[1:24:35] wrinkle or without spot or without
[1:24:37] blemish
[1:24:38] so he sent a word that can produce that
[1:24:42] kind of church
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:47] and that he's administering this word
[1:24:50] himself
[1:24:51] and he's accomplishing this work himself
[1:24:55] he's not asking us to do anything but
[1:24:58] surrender to yield to give him
[1:25:00] preeminence and when he asked
[1:25:02] preeminence he can finish this work
[1:25:06] he says so want men to love their wives
[1:25:09] as their own bodies
[1:25:15] when Jesus is loving his bride he is
[1:25:18] loving his own body
[1:25:21] when Jesus is purifying his bride he is
[1:25:24] purifying his own body
[1:25:28] amen this work he's doing Amen to purify
[1:25:32] to cleanse his own body because this is
[1:25:35] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] so this is a great mystery
[1:25:41] but I speak of Christ in the church Paul
[1:25:43] says
[1:25:45] let's go to Colossians chapter 1.
[1:25:49] as we finish this evening
[1:25:53] Colossians chapter 1.
[1:26:01] and verse 26.
[1:26:06] even the mystery
[1:26:08] which has been hid from ages and from
[1:26:10] Generations
[1:26:12] but now was made manifest to his
[1:26:16] Saints
[1:26:18] who is it made manifest to the
[1:26:20] recipients of his elective lives
[1:26:23] to the greatly beloved to the highly
[1:26:25] favored they're the only ones that this
[1:26:28] is this Revelation is Manifest to
[1:26:33] to whom
[1:26:35] to who
[1:26:37] to that group
[1:26:39] to whom to the Saints to the greatly
[1:26:42] beloved to the highly favored
[1:26:45] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:26:47] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:26:49] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:26:52] you
[1:26:53] the hope of glory
[1:26:57] why is it that serpent seed makes sense
[1:27:00] to you
[1:27:04] when you tell it to multitudes and
[1:27:06] they're confused
[1:27:07] and they go back and read the Bible
[1:27:10] and they say it's fruit
[1:27:12] when they when they say that Eve said
[1:27:15] I've gotten a man from the Lord and and
[1:27:18] all of these things but when you go back
[1:27:20] and read it it's so plain
[1:27:23] why is it serpent seed make sense to you
[1:27:26] why is it water baptism in Jesus
[1:27:28] Christ's name is the only scriptural
[1:27:30] baptism
[1:27:32] why is it that you can see that Malachi
[1:27:36] 4 and Revelation 10 1-7 are the same
[1:27:38] thing
[1:27:39] and Luke 17 30 is a son of man revealing
[1:27:43] the son of man and that William Branham
[1:27:44] was the Fulfillment of those scriptures
[1:27:46] how come you can see that who taught you
[1:27:48] what intellectual book did you read amen
[1:27:51] you can get it intellectual but that
[1:27:53] won't work that's not what it is it's
[1:27:55] when he reveals it to you personally and
[1:27:58] you know that's the Fulfillment of that
[1:27:59] scripture you know that's the way it is
[1:28:01] you know there's no other option if it
[1:28:04] wasn't for serpent seed this is a
[1:28:05] confusing book amen because it explains
[1:28:08] everything else in the Bible
[1:28:12] why is it you know it's not denomination
[1:28:15] it's not church that he's after but it's
[1:28:17] the individual connected to Christ that
[1:28:19] he's after in this day how come you know
[1:28:21] that how come you see that and
[1:28:23] multitudes don't
[1:28:25] and how come you know that this is the
[1:28:27] day that he's coming in Bride form
[1:28:30] that if you want to find Christ you must
[1:28:32] find him in the formation of the Bride
[1:28:34] amen because the wheat seed has come
[1:28:36] back to life in feminine form how come
[1:28:39] you can see that because he's drawn you
[1:28:41] to himself and he's given you of his
[1:28:43] Spirit he's revealed the word to you
[1:28:45] because you were part of his elective
[1:28:47] love from before the foundation of the
[1:28:49] world no matter how many people hear
[1:28:51] that only a few believe it no matter how
[1:28:53] many sit in Bible studies have it
[1:28:55] explained sit under preaching for years
[1:28:57] only a few can ever grasp that because
[1:29:00] they had to be part of that elected
[1:29:02] group from before the foundation of the
[1:29:04] world
[1:29:05] if you want security this is the
[1:29:08] greatest security I know of if you're
[1:29:10] looking for evidence that you're part of
[1:29:12] God's plan that you were chosen in him
[1:29:14] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:29:16] you're going to have it manifest to you
[1:29:17] by faith what faith faith in the word
[1:29:20] that God has placed in me something that
[1:29:22] knows that this is every bit the truth
[1:29:24] he has drawn me he has given his Spirit
[1:29:27] to me he has revealed his word to me
[1:29:29] it's not a makeup for me it's not a
[1:29:31] pretend for me it's not intellectual for
[1:29:34] me it's a reality for me
[1:29:37] and if that becomes a reality for you
[1:29:40] the next day amen when something bad
[1:29:42] happens in your life it doesn't change
[1:29:44] God's love for you it doesn't change
[1:29:46] your position in Christ nothing has
[1:29:48] changed this is just something God is
[1:29:50] going to do
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:56] God's love his elective love is
[1:30:00] manifested as he draws us to himself
[1:30:05] God so loved the world
[1:30:07] he sent his only begotten son
[1:30:10] whosoever should believeth in him
[1:30:12] shall not perish but have everlasting
[1:30:15] life
[1:30:16] he came not to condemn the world
[1:30:19] through him
[1:30:20] but those who believe not are condemned
[1:30:22] already
[1:30:24] so he sent his world but his love sent
[1:30:28] his son
[1:30:30] but his elective love gave a revelation
[1:30:33] to just a few of who that son was
[1:30:37] his General love sent the son into the
[1:30:40] world but his elective love quickened
[1:30:43] the Revelation in the heart of Peter his
[1:30:45] elected love quickened the Revelation in
[1:30:47] the heart of Paul his elected love
[1:30:48] quickened the Revelation in the heart of
[1:30:50] his disciples that they would recognize
[1:30:52] this is the Son of God this is the
[1:30:55] Messiah this his elective love his
[1:30:57] General love sent Christ into the world
[1:30:59] his elective love quickened the woman in
[1:31:02] Samaria at a well talking to a man in
[1:31:04] flesh
[1:31:08] God's love
[1:31:10] sinner Healing Ministry
[1:31:12] throughout the world in the end time
[1:31:15] sparking healing revivals and bringing
[1:31:18] people back to Faith In God's word that
[1:31:20] was God's General love but a specific
[1:31:22] love whispered love secrets in the ear
[1:31:24] of his bride
[1:31:25] revealed the hidden Mystery
[1:31:29] and if you've received that revelation
[1:31:33] then you should be the happiest person
[1:31:35] on the planet
[1:31:36] you should be so secure in God's love
[1:31:39] because God doesn't whisper these
[1:31:41] secrets to nobody else not the flirters
[1:31:43] not the churches not the friends he only
[1:31:45] Whispers these secrets to his sweetheart
[1:31:48] the one that he chose before the
[1:31:50] foundation of the world
[1:31:52] and the message possessing the Gate of
[1:31:54] the enemy after the trial to see the
[1:31:56] Bible is a supernatural book
[1:31:58] it's written so that it's hid from the
[1:32:00] school's Theologian how many knows that
[1:32:02] Jesus thanked God he said I thank thee
[1:32:05] father thou has hid this from the wise
[1:32:06] and prude and revealed it unto babes
[1:32:08] such as would learn it's a book of love
[1:32:12] when the love of God comes into the
[1:32:14] heart then you fall in love with God
[1:32:16] then he reveals himself the Bible
[1:32:18] meaning
[1:32:20] how does he reveal himself he gives you
[1:32:22] the Bible meaning the true
[1:32:23] interpretation of the word
[1:32:26] I'm going to read that again it's a book
[1:32:28] of love
[1:32:30] it's not a book of love just because it
[1:32:32] says God is love
[1:32:35] it's not a love letter just because you
[1:32:37] can read and say that God is love
[1:32:41] that's not what makes it a love letter
[1:32:43] what makes it a love letter is when you
[1:32:45] understand what he means by what he says
[1:32:49] it's a book of love when the love of God
[1:32:52] comes into the heart then you fall in
[1:32:53] love with God then he reveals himself
[1:32:56] the Bible meaning the interpretation of
[1:32:59] the Bible is God himself interpreting
[1:33:02] his promises but the Bible it's written
[1:33:05] between the lines
[1:33:07] when when brother Benham talked about
[1:33:10] the love letter that his wife would
[1:33:12] write to him
[1:33:14] anybody else could read the letter but
[1:33:16] not catch the meaning
[1:33:18] because her meaning was between the
[1:33:20] lines
[1:33:22] and the Bible is a book of love
[1:33:25] but you can't get the love story if you
[1:33:28] only read the surface level of the Bible
[1:33:32] if you just read the surface level of
[1:33:33] the Bible you've missed the story of
[1:33:36] Rahab
[1:33:37] you've missed you've missed the story of
[1:33:39] Ruth you've missed Esther you've you've
[1:33:41] missed it all amen because we've just
[1:33:43] read we've just read his the history of
[1:33:45] the church we've just read things that
[1:33:47] God had done but we didn't catch the
[1:33:49] story within the story we didn't catch
[1:33:51] the mystery that was within the pyramid
[1:33:53] the the unwritten word the mystery
[1:33:56] secret that was inside the pyramid amen
[1:33:59] it was written all around the outside
[1:34:00] and brother Benham went around
[1:34:02] interpreting the outside of that pyramid
[1:34:04] giving the correct interpretation where
[1:34:06] the teachings of the Bible were all
[1:34:08] scattered he brought it back together
[1:34:09] and interpreted it but then he peeled
[1:34:12] off the captive show there's been a
[1:34:13] secret inside this all the time and the
[1:34:16] secret is that Jesus Christ wants to be
[1:34:18] formed as a bride as well
[1:34:20] male and female there's been a secret
[1:34:23] into this you can read the love story
[1:34:25] and never catch the Love Story amen It's
[1:34:28] Not Your Love Letter unless you can read
[1:34:31] the mystery between the lines
[1:34:33] and that only comes to the greatly
[1:34:35] beloved
[1:34:37] that only comes to the highly favored
[1:34:42] the one who was like the woman at the
[1:34:44] well
[1:34:45] like Mary is a teenage girl
[1:34:48] like the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee
[1:34:51] like the publican
[1:34:53] like so many multitudes of others that
[1:34:56] were unlearned unscriptured illiterate
[1:35:00] ignorant living filthy lives
[1:35:03] but they were chosen in him before the
[1:35:05] foundation of the world
[1:35:07] they were part of his elective love and
[1:35:09] would never be separated from that love
[1:35:12] so in due time he would send a messenger
[1:35:14] to each one
[1:35:17] amen and that messenger would say
[1:35:19] hell thou highly favored
[1:35:23] there would be something inside of each
[1:35:25] one of God's elected seed that would say
[1:35:28] that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:35:33] that's the manifestation of God's
[1:35:35] elective love
[1:35:37] the next time your prayers not answered
[1:35:39] remember Paul's wasn't answered either
[1:35:40] he wanted to be delivered of his
[1:35:42] sickness
[1:35:44] the next time that that that seems like
[1:35:47] you're in a cycle of negative and
[1:35:49] everything spiraling downhill just
[1:35:51] remember it's happened to Saints before
[1:35:53] and it was never proof for evidence of
[1:35:56] God's displeasure with them and never
[1:35:58] removed them from God's elective love
[1:36:01] sometimes we need to go back to our
[1:36:04] calling amen
[1:36:06] sometimes we need to go back to our
[1:36:08] Awakening
[1:36:09] and say I didn't awaken myself
[1:36:12] he woke me up I didn't call myself I
[1:36:15] didn't give myself the ability to
[1:36:17] receive this word that came from him he
[1:36:19] drew me he called me he gave me his
[1:36:22] Spirit he revealed his word to me why
[1:36:25] why did he do that for me when
[1:36:27] multitudes haven't got it why me because
[1:36:30] I was part of him from before the
[1:36:32] foundation of the world and chosen him
[1:36:34] and I'm part of his elective love and he
[1:36:37] chose Jacob and hated Esau before they
[1:36:40] ever had a chance to do good or evil
[1:36:41] it's not my good or evil it's his choice
[1:36:44] that's moving in my life
[1:36:47] and now my love for him surrenders all
[1:36:51] obeys him loves him serves him gives up
[1:36:57] my mind my past my thoughts my ambitions
[1:37:01] and just says Lord being unto me
[1:37:05] according to your word and God bless you
[1:37:08] let's all stand this evening
[1:37:15] I hope you understand
[1:37:17] what I was trying to say
[1:37:21] we should be the happiest people that
[1:37:23] ever we should be so secure in God's
[1:37:26] love
[1:37:27] and that the devil shouldn't be able to
[1:37:29] make us insecure by trials and
[1:37:31] tribulations and troubles and dark
[1:37:34] cloudy skies and Troublesome times and
[1:37:36] uh tumultuous water that shouldn't bring
[1:37:39] us trouble amen because God's already
[1:37:42] proven his love to us and already
[1:37:44] declared that we are accepted in the
[1:37:46] Beloved we should be secure in his love
[1:37:48] regardless of what happens
[1:37:51] you can't stop your flesh from getting
[1:37:53] tossed about but there should be an
[1:37:55] anchor in the soul amen you can't stop
[1:37:57] your mind from reeling amen but there
[1:37:59] should be a reality on the inside that
[1:38:02] when it gets rough there's a check that
[1:38:04] comes and says wait a minute he called
[1:38:06] me he chose me he predestinated me he
[1:38:09] revealed himself to me he still loves me
[1:38:13] praise God
[1:38:15] let's just bow our heads and pray Lord
[1:38:17] Jesus we're so thankful for your
[1:38:19] goodness Lord
[1:38:21] God we haven't merited it Lord we're not
[1:38:24] worthy of it we haven't done anything to
[1:38:26] earn it Lord but this is what you chose
[1:38:28] before the foundation of the world we
[1:38:31] can never climb high enough to find you
[1:38:33] we can never run fast enough to overtake
[1:38:36] you
[1:38:37] God if you didn't stop and come to us we
[1:38:40] would never have found you
[1:38:42] and if you didn't turn aside like you
[1:38:44] did to the woman of Samaria and come and
[1:38:47] find us where we were in our lives we
[1:38:49] could have never found you
[1:38:52] and oh God you found us you called us
[1:38:55] you revealed your word to us you
[1:38:57] quickened us to life
[1:38:59] because you have before predestinated us
[1:39:02] unto salvation
[1:39:04] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:39:06] belief of the truth
[1:39:08] oh God we're so grateful
[1:39:11] for when we were completely unable you
[1:39:13] were able
[1:39:15] when we were insufficient you were more
[1:39:17] than sufficient
[1:39:19] God you sent your word in this day and
[1:39:22] you sent your word to call us back to
[1:39:25] yourself
[1:39:26] to unite with us to sanctify us and wash
[1:39:29] us with the washing of the water of the
[1:39:31] word that you might unify yourself with
[1:39:33] us and dwell in us and manifest yourself
[1:39:36] in Bride form in this day
[1:39:39] God we receive it we believe it we
[1:39:42] surrender to it in Jesus Christ's name
[1:39:43] it's nothing but the truth and we
[1:39:45] believe it with all of our hearts God
[1:39:48] and We Know by this Lord that we are
[1:39:50] part of your plan
[1:39:52] because of what you've done not what
[1:39:54] we've done but what you've done we
[1:39:57] recognize it we acknowledge it we
[1:39:59] receive it and we give you Thanksgiving
[1:40:01] with all of our hearts Lord our desire
[1:40:04] now is to surrender like we've never
[1:40:06] surrendered before to give you first
[1:40:09] place to love you with all our hearts
[1:40:10] with all our minds with all our strength
[1:40:12] with everything that's in us we want to
[1:40:14] love you Lord
[1:40:16] help us father
[1:40:18] have your way in US Lord As you move
[1:40:20] your plan in our lives God as you reveal
[1:40:24] yourself through these bodies of Flesh
[1:40:26] Lord we live in the day when the word is
[1:40:28] becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming
[1:40:30] the word Lord let this flesh that we
[1:40:33] dwell and become your word as your word
[1:40:35] moves through US uninhibited
[1:40:37] unrestricted by our own thinking
[1:40:39] unrestricted by our own lust
[1:40:41] unrestricted by our own desires but may
[1:40:43] we lose out every desire every thought
[1:40:46] every carnal idea so that that word can
[1:40:49] flow freely through us so that this
[1:40:52] flesh can become the word manifested in
[1:40:54] this day
[1:40:55] help us God to surrender in a greater
[1:40:58] fashion that you might finish the work
[1:41:00] that you've left for this hour
[1:41:03] oh we love you
[1:41:04] all we deny any lie of the devil that
[1:41:08] tries to take your love from us put us
[1:41:10] outside your love by our actions or our
[1:41:13] misgivings Our inabilities God we know
[1:41:15] that you loved us before that Lord and
[1:41:17] you loved us throughout it all

[1:41:51] call and you drew me to your side by
[1:41:53] Whispering love secrets in my ear to
[1:41:55] draw me up next to you and so now I know
[1:41:57] my identity by the Revelation that
[1:42:00] you've brought in my life
[1:42:01] not by my Deeds not by my worthiness not
[1:42:04] by my birth not by a church I've chosen
