but there has to be a bride at the end time that has the mind of the author there has to be a people that can navigate difficult situations there has to be a people that can land between two Commandments and navigate their way through without taking the easy Road without serving self without justifying wrong action there has to be a people who's honest there has to be a people who's real there has to be a genuine representation of Jesus Christ upon this Earth in the end time there has to be a people who can walk the razor's Edge and I'm not even claiming to be one of those people yet but I believe that he's going to put me in that position because that's what he's called for at this end time there's got to be a people that can look Beyond amen some of the knee-jerk reactions and and look to the motive of the heart and judge with righteous judgment and deal with the weightier matters of the law praise God oh friends I don't always know I don't always know how to proceed I just know how God leads I don't even know why like for me I would love to button this up so tight and give you the parameters on this truth I can't give you the parameters on this truth this walk of a Christian Life is the most dangerous you'll ever walk there's pitfalls everywhere there's landmines all around you there's millions of ways to be completely wrong and there's millions of ways to hurt yourself and hurt other people there's only one way to be right and you've got to be tuned in with Christ you have to be in him and him in you and you got to be surrendered and submitted to that Spirit that's the only way we're going to make it we listen in all the word that's been restored to us and the word has been marvelously restored to us we've got so much word we got the unveiling of the word we've been brought back to the original doctrine of the Apostles but we still find ourselves in situations we don't have a clear answer for and under the unveiling of the word under the restoration of the doctrine under everything that's been put in the right place we still sometimes find ourselves in situations that I don't know which word to apply cuz two or three may fit in this situation amen that's when you're going to have to be led by the spirit
