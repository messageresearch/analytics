we're asking you to come and speak lord we're asking you to come and minister through a gift and break the bread of life that we might receive what we have need of this morning pray that you would lord just open our eyes that we might see and we might understand we might live according to your word in this hour upon the earth for god we were predestinated and born for this hour may we be faithful lord to do all that you lead us to do have preeminence in us lord take control as we yield ourselves to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you this morning while you're standing let's turn to malachi chapter four we're going to start with a familiar scripture and i'd like to just continue to thought from sunday we're ministering sunday on i think i titled it the same ministry and i like to call this this morning a vessel of the word for salvation a vessel of the word for salvation i just want to it's the same theme that we were looking at i just want to keep looking at it through the bible and ask god to give us a greater understanding all the time amen many of these things that we've talked about before but we go back around and we see him more clearly over and over again we go back to something we've known and all of a sudden it's new again and we know it in a greater way and so we want to look at these things that way malachi chapter 4 verse 5. behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse amen let's turn keep your hand here in malachi we're going to come back let's turn to luke 18 and read this while we're standing before we're seated luke 18 and verse 8 luke 18 and verse 8 i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth may may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated and let's go back to malachi the question was when the son of man cometh we know that we live in the day of the coming of the son of man and the revealing of the son of man and the question is when he cometh shall he find faith on the earth and the answer i believe in my heart is yes amen he's found faith because he's planted a seed of faith in me to to receive him by faith it's all by his grace it's all by his master plan and when he returns shall he find faith and the answer is yes because of grace we look at malachi chapter 4 verse 6 let's go back to 5 and read it again it says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord we know this is a prophecy of the seventh church age messenger the seventh angel when he shall come and we know this was fulfilled in the life of brother branham and when we know this prophecy is laying here and he's saying i will send elijah before the coming of the dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so we find that if god had not sent elijah and if that ministry had not turned the hearts of the children back amen to the fathers then he would have smote the earth with a curse so the very fact that god would send elijah the prophet on our day is to prevent the earth from being cursed from being smitten with the curse amen but there was two parts to that amen there was god who would have to send the ministry of elijah the spirit of elijah again but there had to be a people who could have their hearts turned back amen and it would take both to prevent the smiting of the earth with a curse and so we find out that god in order to make sure that his plan would continue he would have to in due season send the spirit of elijah upon one that he ordained to have that spirit but he would also have to ordain vessels that could receive that ministry and have their hearts turned back amen so it would take vessels of the word vessels that could have the word vessels that could receive the word amen it took vessels upon the earth to receive the ministry to receive the word to manifest that word amen that would be here for the prevention of the smiting of the earth with the curse so you are here to prevent the smiting of the earth with the curse a minute it sounds so strange but what are you doing amen and people they'll ask you all the time what do you do they want to know you know where do you work and what do you do oh i'm here to to believe the word to prevent the earth from being smitten with a curse try that next time you meet somebody new what do you do well i mean i'm here to prevent the earth from being smitten with the curse yeah let me know how that goes when you tried that a couple of times it should actually open the door for some interesting conversations we have to understand amen when we look at the word the word is very specific and the word is stating that it has a purpose and god has a plan amen and that plan is so much bigger than our carnal plans and our carnal ideas amen we get plans and we get ideas and we plan on where we're going to go to dinner on friday and who we're going to fellowship with on sunday and there's nothing wrong with those plans but god has a plan so much greater than that plan and we're here on this earth to do more than just those things that we're planning we're here to fulfill his plan his purpose and his purpose in having you here amen is to receive that spirit of elijah ministry so that your heart can be turned back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers so that you can prevent the smiting of the earth with a curse and you say well well isn't the earth going to be smitten with the curse no sir amen because there was people on the earth to receive that ministry there's not going to be smiting of the earth with a curse there's going to be a purging of the earth with fire amen that's not a curse that's a cleaning amen and the earth is looking forward to that cleaning amen it's groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god it's it's wanting to come to that cleaning to burn sin off amen to reestablish righteousness the earth amen is an attribute of god then there's a memory in the earth amen and i hope you'll forgive me for saying that but this earth amen remembers what it was amen under adam's rule in perfection when he had his when he had his kingdom set up in eden in the garden of eden and everything was as it should be and when adam fell it threw the world into chaos amen and it's the same world the same elements amen that were in perfection have been thrown into chaos but the earth is groaning all creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god what are they groaning for there must be something that the earth knows amen this is the language of the bible we know that god made the earth with his spoken word amen and he refashioned it in genesis by his word and the earth is also an attribute of him we know that the earth is also saved it sounds odd but the earth is also saved it's redeemed he shed his blood to redeem amen not just you and i but he also redeemed the earth so if there had not been a vessel of the word that god could come and anoint with the with the spirit of elijah and if there had not been vessels of the word that could receive that that ministry and have their hearts turned back then this earth would be cursed but but god will not allow his attribute god will not allow amen the product of his mind of his thinking to be cursed amen so he made sure there was a vessel that could receive that ministry and there were vessels that hearts could be turned back amen so that there could be redemption so your very existence amen has something to do with the redemption of the earth so it's always what i find when i read the bible the message has come to illuminate this word to open our understanding so we can see it's so much bigger than what we thought it was because it wasn't for this message we'd be comfortable living such a narrow vision small life with such a narrow focus amen our focus would be just it would be we would be self-centered we'd be self-focused and we'd be trying to do the best we can to behave the best way we can to act right amen and make sure everything in our circle is right and we would be constantly uh inwardly focused self-focused trying to get everything right amen but the message has come to open it up to show us amen this is about more than just you having good conduct amen god is using you for redemption for a plan of redemption for something so much greater than you could ever realize and when we preach these things we're not we're not preaching these things so that we can be elevated and inflated as human beings and be proud and have our chest stuck down no really what we're preaching these things for is to awaken us to stop small thinking to stop carnal thinking to wake up so we can give our lives completely to this word because it's about so much more than we thought it was i mean it's probably so much more than we think it is now if we could really see the plan and we could really even see beyond the carnality and have a perfect heavenly vision it's so much bigger than we would realize amen it would it would not just require our devotion as if we have to give it out of a law or out of an obligation but it would be such a vision that it would demand our our complete consecration by the magnitude of the vision would give us such a heart to say this is the only thing i want to live for it's so perfect it's so beautiful it's so beyond anything i could imagine there's nothing else i want to live for this is the only thing i want to live for that's what the message has come and done in this age is it as it opens the bible it opens us away from moves us away from denominational thinking small thinking carnal thinking and brings us into a greater vision of a plan god had before the foundation of the world and god correcting something that first went wrong in heaven and our understanding goes so far beyond amen waking up in the morning and hitting the alarm clock amen and driving down the road amen that's all part of this greater vision but if we don't have the greater vision we start to lose purpose and hitting the alarm clock getting dressed and driving down the road and so the magnitude of the plan of god requires our absolute devotion not because we have to because we're absolutely in awe at what god is doing and it and it draws from us a devotion a consecration a laying down of our own will in our own lives and our own ideas because when you see his plan it's so much better than our plan and his thinking so much higher than our thinking that when we begin to tap into god's thinking and brings us out of our thinking amen then all of a sudden we don't want our thinking anymore because my thinking would have been wrong a thousand times over but god's thinking is perfect and so now we look that we look at this and we realize that that i am here as a chosen vessel of god i am a place a house for the word of god and the word of god is moved by the spirit of god and it's living through this vessel amen and it's far beyond my even my own human consciousness my own ability of self-awareness it's even way beyond that and and now i i have a i have a a a responsibility because not just my responsibilities his responsibility but my responsibility to yield into his hand amen and submit myself to him so that he can take the preeminence because i see there's a plan that's so powerful there's such a magnitude in this plan that if i do this myself i will ruin it amen i will mess up this perfect plan that god has so the only option i have is to forget my own thinking in my own ways and my own ideas and i've got to surrender it to him so that he'll take preeminence because that's the only way i'm going to keep from ruining what he's trying to do i cannot do it with my thinking my intelligence my willpower my my this and my that it will never make it friends it's never good enough but the plan is so much bigger it's not just i want to go to church i want to believe jesus i want to raise my family right and i want to do those things that's the same understanding that a denominational believer has and there's nothing wrong with that that's not wrong but it's not big enough because under that small thinking we make decisions and choices based off this small bubble that we're trying to preserve you know be a good christian go to church support the church raise my family to love god and because of that if i can still make choices and do things that don't interrupt that i still feel good about myself i still feel like i'm doing right i'm doing good because my vision is so narrow that i'm just trying to accomplish this in my life and i don't realize god is trying to accomplish 10 times a thousand times more than i ever realized and he needs more than this much of devotion amen he needs a life that's completely surrendered and said god i don't know where to go i don't know what to say i don't know where to walk i don't know what to do it's so perfect it's so beautiful amen i don't want to make the wrong step i don't want to rake the wrong move god i'm in your hands use me lord because when god forced all you he forced all you before the foundation of the world he he knew the real you that's down on the inside that portion of the word that he's allotted to come forth in this day and he knew that portion of the word amen wouldn't be the portion that would hammer on an ark wouldn't be the portion that would march out of egypt wouldn't be the portion that would be a mighty man united to david before he comes into his kingdom you wouldn't even be the portion that that would sit and listen to the teaching of jesus by the sea of galilee but that portion of the word that portion of the life of god that's inside of you would be the portion that would come into a vessel that would have its heart turned back amen to the faith of the fathers to prevent god from smiting the earth with a curse just as important as noah building the ark just as important as moses leading them out just as important as those who were the disciples of jesus and followed him through through galilee and nazareth and into judea the role is just as important scripturally and when we look through the bible how many of you are thankful that noah was faithful how many are faithful that moses are thankful that moses was faithful amen that the disciples were faithful that paul was faithful amen we we are so thankful that god interrupted paul and paul surrendered everything and became a prisoner to jesus christ because i read amen 14 books of the bible that i wouldn't have if paul hadn't surrendered himself completely to the hand of jesus christ i'm so thankful that he was a prisoner i'm so thankful he wasn't a part-time believer i wasn't i'm so thankful he wasn't trying to keep his business going and start another tent shop and then put somebody over that and build a tent building empire i'm so thankful he surrendered everything because i'm here today with the revelation we have today with the word because paul was who paul was and paul gave it all we're here because moses gave all amen we're here because noah gave all we're here because david gave all and god has not called us the partial god has called us to give it all we're prophesied to let's go back and look at genesis chapter 6. you know before we read i just want to think about this the earth groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god the earth wanting to come back into its right position the earth still coming back under redemption brother branham tells us something interesting when he goes to calvary and when we see calvary at calvary when jesus was dying on the cross was there was a disruption of nature the the sun was blackened out amen it was dark and amen the then when jesus died there was a a great earthquake and and so much so that the the temple veil went from top to bottom brother venom said it was a total disruption of nature but but when we look at that we look at you know the the blackening of the sky the darkening of the sky in the middle of the day we look at the earthquake and all of these fearful terrible things but in one place when brother venom describes this he says amen when the son amen saw him on calvary it hid its face behind its hands and wept for joy and that's how brother brahma describes the blacking out of the sun amen he hid his face behind his hands and wept for joy and the earthquake he describes as the rams skipping from hill to hill the mountains were leaping like ram skipping what were they they were so happy amen that there was a price being paid for its redemption the blood was spilling on the ground to redeem the earth to bring it back into its position and look how the earth was responding to redemption it was happy amen the bible talks about that great day when the hills will skip for joy and skip like rams what are they talking about the hill skipping like rams earthquakes what are earthquakes earthquakes are the rejoicing of the earth coming into redemption are earthquakes on the increase is the earth rejoicing that there are those whose hearts have been turned back amen to prevent a curse from coming and smiting it now it's waiting for the purging amen and the millennial reign and jesus christ to set his throne upon the earth you think the earth is not going to enjoy that the earth is going to enjoy it friends just like we're going to enjoy it so god has a plan of redemption and he's using vessels upon the earth if we look here at genesis chapter 6. i'm going to start at verse 1. and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them and the same became mighty men which were which were of old men of renown and god saw the wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and he repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them so god looking down at a man who had become vile and corrupt and a fallen nature that had fallen under this headship of a man that had fallen and he looks in it and he repent they repenteth himself that he had made it earth and man and all that was on it he was going to completely destroy it and wipe it off so there was a going to be a curse come upon the earth he was going to destroy everything but verse 8 says but noah but noah he was going to destroy everything that creepeth everything that moveth and all man but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord i love this butt everything was going to be destroyed man and all the creation upon the face of the earth was going to be destroyed but but there was a vessel of the word that he could use for redemption and salvation in that day but noah was a vessel under grace and noah found grace in the eyes of the lord so we know the story well god now tells noah a plan of salvation for his day amen and a plan to save even the creation upon the earth and he was to take amen two of every clean beast the male and the female and seven are a two of unclean seven of clean and he was supposed to hide them away in the ark and build the ark and do all that he did and and noah was building when he was building on that ark amen he was working in obedience to the word of god and this vessel of the word received the word amen was creating a way of escape he was creating a redemption he was creating amen a salvation and he worked and he worked and he worked amen and and god brought amen two of of the beasts and seven of the clean and brought them into the ark and noah and his sons they come into the ark as well and so noah if you think of it this way noah had a message of destruction noah had a message of imminent doom and destruction amen but noah also had a message of salvation and escaped from destruction it wasn't a one-sided message amen noah was telling them that it would rain the prophet of god goes in great detail amen and they had scientific instruments they could measure there's no moisture there there's no rain we've never had rain before they didn't believe him and noah was was speaking of an imminent doom amen but god because he had a vessel amen under grace in that day he had a vessel that could create a way of escape he had a vessel who in the face of destruction could be preaching a way of salvation and we know it wasn't just noah that was saved but the creation the creatures that god had made were now saved upon the ark and after the ark i'd landed back on mount air right in the and the the land had dried off amen the animals dispersed again and filled the earth again with the creation that god had created with the animals that god had made he had preserved them and they would not have been preserved if noah had not found grace in the eyes of the lord what god had spoken to existence the spoken word of god the animals and the creation it would have been absolutely wiped off and destroyed if there not had been a vessel of god on the earth that could open a door of salvation and what was the door of salvation amen the message of destruction also carried with it a door of salvation this is so good let's go to genesis chapter 7. verse 23 and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark everything was destroyed except this vessel and all that were with him in the ark so noah if we could look at it this way noah was a vessel of god a vessel of the word for salvation noah's message he was preaching the message he preached was judgment and destruction but with him was salvation those that were with him in the ark were all saved and we know later we would find that even even one that was with him would end up having a cursed line and ham would would end up under a curse but he was with him in the ark and he was saved so noah with a message of destruction with him when he he was manifesting the word when he would saw down a board and nail it on what was he doing he was living the word he was manifesting the word for his day and under the manifestation of the word for his day there was an opportunity at salvation and everything was destroyed except those that were with noah in the ark let's go to john chapter 3. john chapter 3 verse 12. if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but of eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is con not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so now we find out this is a very familiar passage of scripture people quote this all the time but you realize verse 17 for god sent not a son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved jesus was not sent for condemnation he was sent for salvation noah was not sent for condemnation because god had already condemned the earth before he called noah noah was not sent for condemnation and judgment god had already passed judgment before he called no into his ministry noah's ministry was to open a way of escape and when that was rejected darkness was turned away or light was refused there was only the path of darkness death had to come but they were already under a curse of death noah didn't condemn them to death when they refused to walk in the light they remained in death they remained in judgment so jesus christ did not come to condemn the earth the earth was already condemned so his message was not a message of condemnation he was here for salvation and in that salvation was warning that the earth is condemned amen everything is condemned everything is rotten but that was the condition it was already in already bound for judgment already doomed already under a curse already bound to fail amen so when they refused the prince of life they refused light they refused life amen there was nothing left but to remain in darkness and to remain in death so they refused jesus christ amen and 70 or a few years later in 70 a.d titus marches in and destroys all of jerusalem hey listen jerusalem was bound for destruction anyways it was already condemned amen they were under a curse before christ showed up they just kept themself under a curse and heaped more destruction upon themselves by rejecting the prince of life noah come on the scene after god had already judged the earth and condemned the earth now noah is only telling the people warning them of what god has already declared he is only telling them what what the condition already is they're already under judgment they're already bound for destruction amen god is already finished with this world amen but god has made a way if you can come this way there is a way of salvation a way of escape amen and knowing his sons and his son's wife and his son's wife they found a way to escape but so did a bird and a lizard amen and a deer and an elephant and a whatever also found a way of escape it wasn't just the elect predestinated seed but it was anybody anything else that could get in that ark because noah was there a bird was saved i know that sounds silly but i just want you to catch a bigger picture if noah had not been there and found grace in the eyes of god that bird would have never survived those sheep would have never survived that that whatever creature that was in that ark would have never survived amen and there would have been a mass extinction and they would have not what god had created for pleasure would have been wiped off the earth but because there was one that could come on the scene because he found grace in the eyes of god a chosen vessel for that day he had a message of life but it may have sounded to many like a message of death the perception of those that were living the life they wanted to live upon the earth were happy with the way things were and their wickedness and the imagination of their heart continually they looked at noah and noah had a message amen and his message was rough and his message was condemning and his message was exclusive think of all the terms that you can use noah was believing his way was the only way it was narrow-minded it was exclusive it was it was i mean it was self-elevating noah said you know god told me and the only way to be saved is to get on this boat that he told me to build really noah [Music] it was seemingly self-elevating seemingly condemning and saying you know god is going to judge you there's going to be a flood god's not happy with this world and there were people there who were happy there were people that are satisfied with their life there were people there who were enjoying amen having the imaginations of their heart fulfilled all the time even though it was evil they were satisfied so noah's message sounded condemning sounded harsh sounded exclusive sounded narrow-minded sounded self-uh self-inflated but it was the truth and the only way of salvation it it was and it was god through a vessel of grace preaching grace preaching mercy amen but because it was so different amen than what they viewed they viewed it as evil when it was good that's the same way they viewed jesus christ his ministry was viewed by the religious leaders as evil as wicked as condemning as harmful [Music] he was condemning the religion of the day amen and they felt like when he came against the religion of the day that he was coming against the law of moses and he in no way was coming against the law of moses he was showing them that they're cursed under the law of moses that the very law that they believed was the very law that had cursed them and condemned them and now there was a way of escape upon the earth amen there was a vessel of the word there to open a door amen and they didn't want to go through that door they were happy in the life they had so the message of jesus christ sounded to many like it was narrow exclusive he said i am the bread that come down from god out of heaven amen unless you come to me i mean just think of how this sounded in the day that he was preaching the message it sounded harsh critical condemning when he would say such harsh things about ministries harsh things about high priest and chief elders and teachers of the words it didn't sound like mercy but jesus was not sent into the world to condemn the world that was not the purpose god sent him that was not the purpose god called noah god called noah to make a way of escape because it was already condemned god brought jesus christ to make a way of escape because the world was already condemned friends you and i are here with the same kind of message the same kind of message because there's an arc of safety in this day and it's the message of the hour but to many it sounds exclusive narrow-minded self-elevating it's no different than the rest of the bible amen and in this i'm preaching this for me not for you but but because every once in a while i need god to redial the dials and get my thinking back and my attitude right in the right spot because the bride is not here to condemn the world because we have the same ministry we he had amen it's a continuation of the same thing amen and he was not sent to condemn the world but that through him the world might be saved noah was not sent to condemn the world but that through him the world might be saved amen the bride is not here to condemn the whole world the bride is here to say there is an ark and there is a door there's an open door if you can go through it you can escape the condemnation that's upon the earth but sometimes because of rejection amen and because of harsh words and because of circumstances amen we start to take the attitude that the bride is here for judgment the bride is not here for judgment but those who refuse the message will be judged there is a judgment but really friends they're already judged the the denominations are already judged we're not here to judge them they've been judged we're not here to condemn them they've been condemned now that doesn't mean moses doesn't say because of your wickedness destruction has come he's just saying what's already going on he's not saying if you don't listen to me then god will curse this earth and you'll die no you're already cursed to die but there's a way of escape that's why the bride's message is a message of life the blessed message of safety it's a message of mercy it is a vessel of grace that is here to extend mercy to those who can receive it will there be those who are condemned because they refuse it absolutely but that's not the point that's only the effect for those who won't receive it but that's not the point the point is so that she can be here a voice a continuation of the ministry that we've had in this end time to say come out from among her come come and drink of the water of life freely amen come the spirit and the bride are saying come there's an opportunity to drink of this water of life she's saying come to the fountain come to the life come to the word come to the light come come and be saved come and be free come and drink of the word come and receive the light come and walk in the light come that's the message of the bride and i think sometimes when we when we get beat down a little bit knocked around once in a while amen we tend to take the side of of condemnation and destruction and and this and this and this and this and forget listen as far as we know there's still an open door here god hasn't told us otherwise as far as we know there's a as an open door there's an opportunity and noah stood in the door and preached amen he was standing in the gap he was standing in the breach amen this door was the separation between life and death and he stood in the breach he stood in the gap and he called people to come into the ark come come to the word come to salvation come to your safety he didn't stand in the door and say you're going to die amen because you didn't listen to me and that would have been true that was true but they were already dead he came to offer life the truth is if the message is refused in this day there's nothing left but death and destruction if the message is turned down amen it's the way of escape in this hour it's the word of god this message is christ it is the ark that's the truth and to refuse that is to refuse life and to stay in darkness that's absolutely the truth but if we don't remember that we're here for life where it's a message of life if we don't remember that we can take the wrong attitude and i don't want to take the wrong attitude let's go to genesis chapter 50. genesis chapter 50 verse 19. we're at the end of the story of joseph and we know the story quite well joseph and his brethrens were the they were the 12 sons of their father jacob who was israel and joseph was a beloved son he was a favorite of his dad and he was also very gifted he could see visions and dreams and god spoke to him and he prophesied and in his prophecy he prophesied about god raising him up over his brethren and that their sheaves would all bow to him and even the sun and the moon his mother and father would bow to him and the family didn't like this dream because it looked like he was elevating himself it looked like he was elevating himself it looked like that you were all going to have to come and bow to me is that right but but we know that in order for that vision to come to pass that dream that he had to come to pass that he was going to have to go through certain obstacles and certain difficulties he was going to have to be hated by his brethren sold into bondage into slavery sent down into egypt as a slave sold them to potiphar's house then aft in potiphar's house he would see a reprieve amen from his situation but then that would go away under the the advances of potiphar's wife and now there was a lie told on him and he was sent down in the prison and he would labor in prison for many years and and finally through a set of circumstances god would bring him up into the presence of pharaoh so that he could interpret a dream for pharaoh and from there he would he sat in pharaoh's right hand and he would begin to rule over all of egypt and he was sent down to egypt amen and he suffered he suffered rejection he suffered abuse he suffered all kinds of things that he suffered amen lies false accusations he suffered all all this stuff because he was going to be a vessel amen a vessel of god for life for salvation and in verse chapter 50 verse 19 it says and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god but as for you you thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass is at this day to save much people alive joseph said you know this is the fulfillment of the vision amen that they've come down and now they bow because he's been exalted he's been placed in a position but that position he's been placed in was not to have his brother's bow to him and not to have the sun and moon his parents bowed to him because he's exalted he was exalted into that position so that he could save their lives and not just their lives but he saved much people i mean there was much salvation amen not just for the chosen tribe men of israel not just for the 12 sons and their children they were saved but there was also egyptians saved and other nations say there was much people saved because joseph was brought into position and so joseph's message amen to them it sounded exclusive amen it sounded uh uh self-inflated it sounded however it sounded amen and even the working out of the details probably didn't go according to the way that joseph thought it would happen he didn't realize the rejection and the and then be brought out of prison and all of the things that would happen to him he probably didn't fully realize what was going to happen but he found himself exactly where god said he would be and he was not there for condemnation he was there for life and those who refused to go to jose joseph they would die because he had all the grain if they didn't listen to joseph when joseph gave the interpretation of the dream he said there's going to be seven good years seven years of famine now we need to store up and pharaoh could recognize amen that this was a vessel he needed to listen to and when he listened and subjected himself and all of egypt under joseph joseph had the word of life for that day and when they listened to joseph amen not just the the nation of israel was saved but much people were saved because they listened to joseph they respected joseph they honored joseph they obeyed joseph and under joseph's ministry much people were saved [Music] you meant it for evil god meant it for good been rejected been lied about been falsely accused been all of these things but at the end of the day joseph had a bigger vision than his narrow tunnel vision he had a broader vision that could say i'm in the place of god have any of you been rejected falsely accused for what you believe and what you stand for have you been accused of being self-elevated of being narrow-minded of all of these things if you've been accused of those things amen then then just just realize no matter what happens amen you're in the place of god and that place that god has placed you though it causes rejection and though it causes all kinds of misunderstandings that place is for salvation for many and we have to recognize that so we don't become bitter so that we don't become angry when you look at joseph there's no bitterness in joseph there's no anger in joseph all there is is love for anybody that will come to him to receive the provision there's mercy that's being extended amen he doesn't he doesn't even get after the reuben who was so mean towards him he doesn't say anything about him he's so happy that the one who hated me now will come to me and i can give him life because he's come to me [Music] amen i wonder oh my [Music] i wonder if sometimes we would have somebody who so evilly spoke against us and so abused us and so misused us amen and said such horrible things about what we believe i wonder if god would finally get a hold of their heart amen and they would start believing the message if we'd be happy or sad about that [Applause] [Laughter] when we begin to wash their feet and hug them and take communion side by side and they said such horrible things about you and caused you to weep in your bed at night and say things that grieved you to your heart amen and now they want to they want to believe and come to the church well that's exactly what the first church had to deal with when the apostle paul was converted amen because some of them had relatives slew by him some of them had relatives imprisoned by him some of them may have had paul come into their house and take their dad out of the house and drag him off to prison and beat him there's the church had to live with that reality amen but paul amen was a chosen vessel of god and in due season god got a hold of paul and paul came to the truth he came to the light amen and there had to be people who had to accept that and love paul because this isn't a message of condemnation it's the message of life come and drink of the fountain the spirit and the bright say come anybody that's thirsty says come but you can't say come and when somebody comes say no i don't think this is for you you said too many horrible things you blaspheme the apostle paul said i blasphemed in the scripture he said but i did it ignorantly well to me blaspheme will be blaspheming and he should be cut out forever but you can't cut out a predestinated seat of god i don't know what pass he got but he got a pass and i'm thankful he got a pass and the challenge for that first church was to accept paul that was a challenge to the first church amen because when even when god told ananias to go and lay hands on pray for him he said god i know this man and he's done all kinds of horrible things you don't want me to go there and pray for him you're kidding me and god sent him anyways amen and when he walked in he said brother saul oh praise god he had to get over himself and realize that i'm in the place of god amen i'm in the place of god and i'm in the place of god just for much salvation for much life i'm not here for judgment if i wasn't here the earth would already be under a curse so i'm here to prevent that amen listen if if if malachi 4 had not come where would we be so we look at we look at the ministry of malachi 4 and the rejection of that is a horrible thing but if malachi hadn't come the word was already rejected it was already a horrible thing it's just more of the same more judgment more condemnation more set up for destruction so malachi 4 did not come to bring destruction he came to prevent the curse from smiting the earth and then those who hearts would be turned back to the fathers came to prevent the earth from being smitten with a curse so my my ministry what i'm here for what you're here for is for the prevention of destruction now maybe only a few can come to that prevention but if i'm here on this earth and i live 70 80 90 years and i can prevent one life from being destroyed then i'm in the place of god for life i'm not here for death the world is already under death i'm not here for judgment the world is already judged my life my existence is for life and i have to keep reminding myself of that because there's so many times amen we we tend to get to the negative side everything's evil everything's wicked well that's the truth but if you focus on that you start to get discouraged then when your brothers say things about you they shouldn't say you get discouraged but you're in the place of god for much life to save life much life i say god help us to stay focused on why we're here because if we weren't here with our hearts turned back he would smite the earth with a curse but because his seed is here and their hearts have been turned back and they believe him now the earth won't be smitten with a curse the earth will be purged and cleaned and restored oh i'm so thankful that i'm in the place of god that doesn't mean it's easy but it's still the truth let's go to acts chapter 13. i hope that by the end of this message i can get myself to a place to where i can look forward to talking to that person who's rejected me a thousand times thinking this might be the time because without this understanding i don't want to talk to him again i do not i don't want to come in contact i don't want to rub shoulders i don't want to go back to the family reunion i don't want to i don't want to do any of that but when you realize you're in the place of god and they may have rejected and they may have sold you out and they may have falsely accused you they may have done all of this stuff in the past amen they may have treated you like paul treated the first church they may treated you like joseph's brothers treated him but it doesn't matter amen i'm willing to go back and face it all again because i have a message of life i'm here for life and maybe just maybe god will bring a change acts chapter 13 verse 45 but when the jews saw the multitude they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should just be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed paul has a prophecy over him and that prophecy's fulfilling is out of isaiah but the prophecy is the lord commanded them saying verse 47 i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should be for salvation so what was the purpose of paul why did god call him what was his ministry he was saved for the purpose of salvation he was called for the purpose of salvation unto the ends of the earth now were there many people that were condemned because of the way they treated paul absolutely i would say it this way they were further condemned but he he was a vessel chosen of god to move into a prophecy and in that prophecy he was sent to be enlightened to the gentiles to be for salvation and to the ends of the earth so his ministry was a ministry of salvation to the ends of the earth praise god and paul ran into all kinds of trouble and all kinds of rejection and all kinds of hatred he even he even had people who reject him and lie about him and follow him around amen and propose to be apostles over him and change his doctrine he had all kinds of things happen he even had to commit people into lord and said the lord will deal with them they were they were doing all kinds of horrible things but it didn't change the fact that paul was for salvation his ministry was for salvation those who came against it were hating light they were hating life they were condemning themselves in a greater way they were heaping destruction upon themselves but that was not the purpose of paul's ministry the purpose of paul's ministry was to be for salvation to the ends of the earth and that was the purpose that he lived in and the purpose he moved in amen and in doing that many people further condemned themselves and hate destruction upon their own heads and caused all kinds of trouble for themselves but that wasn't why paul was walking the earth he was walking the earth for salvation even here when the jews refuse him and they reject him and he says now i turn from you and go to the gentiles because you know you count yourselves unworthy of everlasting life when you find over in romans paul is pleading saying my heart's desire is for my brethren to be saved he just recognized that they had rejected life and he was to move into his ministry to the gentiles but he never gave up his heart that israel would be saved he said he would even consider himself a castaway so that they might receive the truth so paul never took that attitude let's turn to jonah jonah chapter 1 and we'll look at verse 1. now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amitay saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up to flee into tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them and to tarshish from the presence of the lord this is an interesting opening scripture because god is telling jonah to go to nineveh in a great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me so he's sent down to cry against the city and he doesn't go there he runs away from the presence of the lord and he takes a ship to tarshish and we know all that happens the storm comes he's thrown into the sea swallowed by the great fish and and then he spit out again but i want to go over to chapter three and pick it up chapter three verse one this was after he spit out upon dry land and says and the word of the lord came into jonah the second time saying arise go into nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee so jonah arose and went into nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey now remember god told jonah here he says preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee so there was a specific message that god gave jonah and jonah was only to speak that message all right preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee i wish i had a manuscript of that word for word so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them for word came unto the king of nineveh and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and satin ashes and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his noble saying let neither man nor beast heard nor flock taste anything let them not feed nor drink water but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yay let them turn everyone from his evil way from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from the fierce anger that we perish not and god saw their works that they turn from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not chapter 4 verse 1 but it displeased jonah exceedingly this whole nation repented and sacked off the masters and god spared a city so large it took three days to journey across it how many hundreds of thousands or i don't know millions or how many people were in that city i don't know but that journey across that being three days across then so so large and they were everyone saved and it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry oh i love the bible and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before into tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger of great kindness and repentancy of the evil and jonah is unhappy about this i read through this scripture and i say praise god praise god you're merciful you're slow to wrath hey amen but jonah's looking at this and say that's what i said in the beginning that's why i went to tarshish i was afraid this would happen i read that again therefore i fled before the tarsus for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentancy of the evil therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life for me for it is better for me to die than to live jonah had something against these people he didn't want them to be saved and you know what these were not god's elected jews they weren't the nation he was working with they weren't his chosen people it was a gentile nation amen and jonah is sent to them and he is he has a message of destruction but he's only to preach what god tells him to preach so he goes and tells them in 40 days there's going to be a destruction i don't know what else he says but whatever he says causes them to repent and humble themselves in sackcloth and ashes and because god is gracious and merciful and kind oh i thought he was just a wrathful god full of judgment he's that too but he's gracious and merciful and kind slow to anger of great kindness and he repents of evil and jonah didn't want these people to be saved jonah wanted them to be cursed and condemned and die they were probably an enemy to israel and we know later they did become an enemy to israel we know in nahim they were finally destroyed god's righteous in all things but here jonah is sent with a message that message looks like a message of destruction but because of the repentance it becomes a message of life and god needed a vessel and jonah thought that he would be a messenger of destruction and a messenger of death and little did he know he was a messenger of life he thought in condemning their conditions and pointing out their sins and calling the judgment of god before them he thought that that would seal the deal amen but he he was inwardly afraid because he was afraid that once they knew what god thought of them they might repent and if they repent god is you know he he has great kindness this is a problem for jonah he's very gracious and full of mercy and has great kindness and he's slow to anger and he repented himself of evil this is a problem for jonah so he runs from the task i said god never let that be a problem for me amen god if you want to save amen save amen however you want to save and listen friends we know that there's going to be salvation dished out at the white throne judgment and there's going to be multitudes saved at the white throne judgment that are not the predestinated elect seed of god because the elect seed of god come up in the first resurrection everything else comes up in the second resurrection is judged and there'll be many in that judgment that are given entrance into the white or given entrance into eternal life and i don't want to be of the attitude of jonah i want there to be multitudes saved on that day i want to see everybody i know i want to see given life at the white throne judgment i can't make non-seed seed i can't change amen what is written in the in the section of eternal life in the lamb's book of life that's unchangeable amen but i would love to see everybody else saved amen and i have a message of life for them too a man jonah had the wrong attitude i don't want to have a jonah attitude sometimes you know when brother branham is condemning denominations and he is good at it how many believers are good at condemning denominations he always says now i'm not talking to you people that some of the loveliest people i know are in the catholic church is that what he said some of the greatest man i know is in the methodist church he said i'm not talking about the people i'm talking about the system and i hope that we can keep that separated i hope we can speak about the system and not speak about the people now we know there's people who make it a system we know that just like there was pharisees and sadducees and high priests and all and they they were guilty and they were wrong and they're condemned there's people who keep the system going and they're going to be they're condemned under that system but there's there some brother bam said some of the greatest man i know is this or is that or is this and i want to have the right attitude in the right approach brother branham tells us the message that day on calvary said he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it came to the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others we have the same ministry this is a continuation of the ministry of jesus christ and he came and he gave a ministry a message for life not for condemnation for life brother branham's message was the same because it's the message of christ it's a message for life it's a message of life our message should be the same and we should live for others because that's what he did our life should be for others and say how is your life for others you know go to the soup kitchen and and do all that well we should we should do whatever we can brother bam said if i can do anything to make somebody's life a little bit better i want to do it so if we have opportunity to do good do it that's what the bible said if you have the opportunity to do good do it and do not be weary in well-doing so if you have opportunity do good do good but how can i live for others amen because i can recognize amen that my very existence on this earth is going to prevent a curse from coming upon this earth and as long as i'm here as far as i know there's an opportunity for somebody amen to come to life amen and i want i want to live my life for that reason i want to live my life for that purpose for others so that i have a broader vision of my life not a narrow vision of my life so that i don't get grumpy and cantankerous and down-hardened and become a hermit in my house and hate life and hate the government and stockpile guns and get a bunch of food and hide out in the basement and hate everybody because it's all corrupt and fallen apart amen what have i done i've removed myself from any opportunity that my existence will have on somebody else's eternal destination jesus says i don't pray to take you out of this world but i pray to keep you in the world to keep you while you're in the world amen because you have to be in the world amen but not of the world because your your very existence on this planet is opening a door creating an opportunity because it's a ministry of life i think if we see if we can just see that and keep it on the forefront of our minds amen it'll change the way we interact with everybody it'll change the way we think about individuals around us it'll change the way we react to situations because can we say in every situation we find ourselves in i'm in the place of god like joseph you meant it for evil you meant this and you meant to curse me and you meant the you know ridicule me and you meant to make me look bad in front of others but god meant it for good i'm in the place of god brother baby says in christ as the mystery god revealed this has become a very familiar quote to us but i want to i want to look at it for just a couple of minutes it says now you see the seals when he was in his mediator work back there redeeming but someday come forth to get the book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he came forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb so i just want to talk about this for a minute all that's in the book would be him so everything that's in the lamb's book of life is him it's actually a record of himself coming forth and that's the believer the words in the book so everything in the book the lamb's book of life is the record of eternal life it's the record of god's life it's the record of christ coming forth in each age and so the words in the book this is the record of christ the words in the book are the individual believers and it's all making up christ coming down through and so when we recognize what that is brother bannon says that was christ and moses that was christ in noah that was christ and abraham that was christ and david why they were the believers they were the words in the book and it was christ in them now when you find yourself in this place this is the lamb's book of life so it is the record of eternal life those attributes that already possess life that are already part of zoe life so that means if you're if you're an attribute of god and a word in that book then you are a possessor of eternal life zoe lies the life of christ is walking around in you and if that life is walking around in you amen somebody can come in contact with zoe life we have to maybe think more broad than we thought in the past think a little larger in scope than the way we've thought in the past i want to read a section out of the sardian church age when brother bannon talks about the names in the book of life and i want to start to look at that he says it is the second resurrection where the five foolish virgins come up notice they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became the part of the bride but these people being a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord i want you to pay attention to what he's saying trying to abide by the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time all these people had their names on the book of life and their names remain but but whose names did not remain those of the world system church who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed that is who will lose out they will be cast into the lake of fire now brother baby's going to talk about several categories of people that are going to be given entrance into eternal life at the white throne judgment and the first ones he's talking about is the foolish virgin and he describes him in many other places but he describes them here this way amen they tried to abide in the word as much as they know of it so as much of the word they know they tried to abide in it and they're being a help in the work of the lord what are they doing they're working with god not against god they're being a help in the work of the lord they're working with the plan of god they're working with the program of god they're working in conjunction with the way god's working they're not working against it whose names are removed those who fight the bride why why is it those who fight the bride amen it's not listen it's not because my neighbor and i have a fight over whose walnuts these are that's not fighting the bride that's fighting your neighbor over walnuts not everybody who fights you for a parking spot has their name scratched off the book of life but the what is the bride the bride is the manifestation of the word the life of christ on display in this day the message of the hour amen when the those of the world church systems fight that their name is scratched off the book amen because why their name was removed because they hated the life they didn't want the light they rejected life they rejected the open door amen they condemned life but those whose names remain they did not fight the life condemned the life they actually were a help in the work of the lord how did they help i don't know you can think of all kinds of ways they can help i don't know how to define it all clearly amen but i know one thing they're helping in the work of the lord and the work of the lord is the message of the hour amen how much they help directly or indirectly i don't know they may be a help in the work of the lord because they still keep bibles going out they may be helping the work of the lord because they keep i don't know helping i don't know how you could use your imagination i don't know but they're they're helping in the work of the lord they're not against the work of the lord but when they're against the work of the lord they no longer have a right to life how come they no longer write the life because they're fighting life itself they're fighting life itself so how could they have right to life when they're fighting life what kind of life is in the bride eternal life they are fighting eternal life why would they be given entrance into eternal life when they're fighting eternal life but this other group who do not already have eternal life they're doing the best they can with what they've got and they're a help in the work of the lord they're supporting they're helping in some way directly or indirectly i don't know but they're helping in the work of the lord and because they're helping life they can have entrance into life god is a very very just god but he's full of kindness full of mercy and gracious god makes a way to come to life he makes a way to come to life even for multitudes who don't already have eternal life he makes a way to come to life what is that way he has vessels of his word that are here for salvation again in the sardisian church age thus if god has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept them if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the foreknowledge of god they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those names we're never placed upon the record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of god who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that i'm going to read that sentence again if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely this is for one purpose only for one reason only they got in solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of god who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that why because he's full of grace and he's great in kindness you're telling me that there's a group of people that can come into eternal life after the white throne judgment solely do we know what solely means solely on the grounds they were good and kind and just to the elect of god he said then we must cannot accept that okay here's the question if none of the elect of god ever interact with another human being who has a chance at entering in on this [Applause] so why are you on the earth maybe your existence on the earth is to make a way of salvation for somebody who has no other way [Music] maybe you're here maybe it's not a message of death maybe it's a message of life maybe you're not here for condemnation maybe you're here for life [Music] maybe you're here so there can be a support amen in the work of the lord amen they'll get in that way maybe you're here because there's those that will solely enter in on grounds that they were kind they were good and kind and just to the elect of god amen if you're the elect of god amen you should be shouting right now and saying my very existence is creating an opportunity for somebody to get entrance into eternal life at the white throne judgment i am not here for death i am not here for condemnation i am here for life [Music] but what about those who fight the bride they're condemned already and then they just give themselves greater condemnation greater trouble greater problems amen it has made it worse but i can't help that i can't stop that from happening but that's not what i'm here for i'm here for life i have a message of life i have eternal life by the grace of god and eternal life is coming in contact with people all the time i say god give me eagle vision fly me up a little higher than i've ever been before so that i can really see what's going on all around me brother ben says in the message elisha the prophet from 1956 says so this woman had seen god in the lie jim she said i think it's nice now if we do something for the servant she built a little room for him on the side of the house i i i think it's nice now if we do something for this servant of god god will respect it why she was just a few hundred years ahead of time jesus said if you give one of my disciples a cup of cold water at the judgment it won't be forgotten we fail to see the power that god has placed in his people god is in his people you believe that god was with his people one time when he walked on the earth but now god is in his people a little while the world sees me no more yet you'll see me for i personal pronoun now will be with you and in you to the end of the world this little woman respected elijah and saw she was he was a man of god and wanted to do a service for him and put a little room there for him to rest and god respected what she did for him and out of that she received a son and she was received life now back to the sardisian church age he goes on to say now then the record of this wheat plant whose end is to produce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life so i'm not going to go fast i'm going to read quite a bit here as we wind down and finish up and i want to teach on this so so so don't wait for me to get all excited amen get excited by what the prophet is telling us because it matters to each one of us every day this what we're reading and learning now impacts every one of us every single day this is our life the record of this wheat plant whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiplied form is the book of life so what is it it's the record of the seed which is christ the seed of abraham amen this the promised seed is christ amen as it goes to the process of being one into a multiplied seed at the end time amen that whole record is the record of the wheat plant is the book of life i repeat the history or record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant a bear seed is sown soon a blade is seen but that is not the wheat yet then it grows into a stalk this is not yet wheat life is there but not the wheat then at the end of the stalk is a little spike that sends out a tassel still a wheat plant but no wheat yet then the plant is pollenized and we see the chaff grow this looks mighty like the wheat but is not yet seed then forms the wheat in the husk it is now back to what it was originally now the ripe and wheat is harvested jesus christ died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself unto glory in the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be the carrier of the life of christ as the blade stalked tussle and husks were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself so the church corporate through the ages has been the carrier of the true seed though not the seed itself that is why we can say the book of life is the whole wheat plant now brother branham tells us and teaches us that there was true seed life in every age so in luther's age there was true seed life amen and that was uh in the land's book of life or the eternal life amen but it was being carried by the corporate church the corporate church was carrying within it the true seed life and then when it come up to wesley's age there was a corporate church and the corporate church was supporting and helping grow amen and supporting the true seed life but the true seed life was coming through that because the truth seed life wasn't going to be made manifest till it was back to original wheat again but there was true seed life through every age but around that was the corporate church bringing it through the corporate church is the book of life and the true record of the true seed life is the lamb's book of life a section of the book of life does that make sense let's go over that again here's that original seed that was planted it produced a blade that wasn't it it produces stalk not it either here comes husk which the wheat is to form that isn't it the tassel appears then pollen falls on those pistols part part of that plant is quick and something of that original seed that came up through the rest of that plant turns into seed why didn't the whole plant go into seed because it was created to that end just part of that plant can go back to being sea because just part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat you have a perfect type of that in israel leaving egypt they came out and about 2 million strong all escaped through the sacrificial blood all were baptized in the red sea all came up out of the water and enjoyed the holy spirit manifestation and blessings all ate angel food all drank of the rock that followed them yet except for a very few they were not but carriers for the children who should follow them and go into canaanland all israel is not israel all but a tiny minority had their name blotted out of the book of life we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the book of life this is the record god hath given us eternal life and this life is in the son he that hath the son hath life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great royal seed jesus christ was planted he died and that life that was in him come up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by spirit they are original now we can see why the redeemed bought back by the original power bride why the redeemed bride she was in him as eve was in adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the record the bride can never have her name taken off the record of life because why she's part of him she's the same life he is you already have eternal life that predestinated sea gene on the inside is a part of zoe life has eternal life can never be scratched out because it can never lose life but there's those who are part of the book of life that don't yet have eternal life but at the white throne judgment they'll be given entrance into eternal life so they can receive life after time they can receive an entrance and come into eternal life after the white throne judgment they don't already have eternal life but there's a part that is part of christ that's coming down through each age amen written in the book the words in the book manifesting in their day and season they already have that eternal life that can never be removed but the other ones can have their name removed in the corporate church let's keep reading amen now we see why i'm sorry she is part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the bride is a member of him and he loses none but that is not so concerning the all in the book of life for amongst them are even those like judas who have a part in the record but their names are removed we can see those who came in the last days and after having done wonderful works jesus will say that he never knew them is it not that he is not aware of them his omniscience precludes that but they were not for known as in the bride and neither were they foreknown as amongst the righteous of the second resurrection they bore no fruit because they were outside the word and did not abide in it and they therefore were sentenced to death then as we have previously shown there are those who stood for the bride and were an aide in a comfort to her those had their names remaining on the book of life and go into life everlasting finally there are those such as pharaoh who never had their names on the book of life and these are cast into the lake of fire also so we find in this record of life in this book of life the record of the wheat plant there are names of many there that were there as carriers are supporters of the true life i want that to become clear they were carrying supporting helping in the work of the lord standing up for being kind to and good and just to the true eternal life and because they supported that life and they were good to that life and they never fought against that life amen their names are in the book of life and they will receive life at the white throne judgment because they never fought life their role was to support life as it came through each age god would make sure that there were individuals there that would support the life that would carry the life that would be good to the life that would stand up for the life and god would make sure that they were there and if they stayed faithful to that calling and never rejected the life their names would remain on the book of life and at the white throne judgment because they supported life because they stood up for life because they they protected life they're going to be given entrance into life god is clear and just in everything that he does and he does everything for a reason that's why it's called the book of life that's why it's the record of life that's why it's eternal life that's why it's entrance into eternal life it all has to do with this life of christ as it moves down through now brother brahms asked a question in questions and answers in 1964 he said brother branham who will populate the earth outside the heavenly city he says i hate to pass this by they're good questions i want my children to know these things see now who will populate the earth outside the city outside it will be the redeem that will populate the earth outside the city but they will not be the elected and called bride the bride will live inside the kingdom with the king on the outside will be the kings of the earth that labor and bring their toils bring their bring their fruits into the city and the doors will not be closed by night now this light on top of the mountain will not lighten the whole world it'll only lighten the city but it can be seen in the distance of thousands of miles maybe but it won't lighten the earth because the bible said in the new world that from one sabbath to another and from one new moon to another will the people come up before the lord and the zion up to the city to worship and now they will be outside the city not the bride but the people that come up in the second resurrection that will be tillers of the soil just like adam was and so forth and carriers of the carers of the garden but the king and queen will remain in the city i want to go to revelations 21 and i want to look at a couple scriptures there and then talk about this quote revelation 21. revelation 21 and verse 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last flags and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife so now one of the angels one of the seven angels having one of the seven vials is going to show you the lamb's wife you're going to see the lamb's wife and he carried me away into the spirit to a great and high mountain and i allowed me and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like into a stone most precious even like jasper stone clear as crystal and then we read a description of a city but we were told we were going to see the lamb's wife and who was going to show us this one of the seven angels which seventh angel showed us the city and gave us the dimensions when you read further it gives us the dimensions in the shape of the city which of the seven angels gave us the dimension and shape of the city that seventh angels already preached future home and he was preaching right out of revelation 21. i mean it already showed us that city and what is that city that city is the redeemed that city is the people remember the book of revelation is a book of symbols it doesn't mean there won't be a city there in the new heavens and new earth but the city is the people not the building so she is the city the lamb's wife is the city is the new jerusalem she is that city now verse 23 and the city had no need of sun neither a moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof now remember the word in the beginning it says in john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was light and life and that life was the light of men so light and life go together and it's the word and in the light and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are saved the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth to bring their glory and honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there praise be to god and they shall bring their glory and honor of the nations into it what are they doing i want to go and read a little bit further now in chapter 22 verse 1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clearest crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb and in the midst of the street of it on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations oh my goodness there's so much here but i'm just going to go to this quote brother branham says the leaves in future home he said the leaves will be for the healing of the nations that is the kings that live in there bring their honor in when they bring their honor in and lay it before the throne of god just like the outside the eleven tribes brought in every one of them a tenth to levi what's he typing it with what are they bringing they're bringing their tithe into the city they're working brother bam said they're working like tillers like adam in all the land amen they're bringing their fruits they're bringing offerings they're bringing their glory and honor and they're bringing it up into the city all right this is really important amen they do they're doing like the 11 tribes every one bring a tenth to levi when they bring their honor and two from the blessed land and that they'll reach from the tree of life and break off a tree of life leaf and they'll walk out together there's no more war everything is at peace the leaves are memorial for the healing of the nations so this means that these kings and these nations are laboring and toiling amen like like in the garden of eden like adam amen tiller of the soil they're working in there and they're bringing their glory and honor they're bringing their tithe into the city and when they bring their tithe into the city amen in exchange for bringing all the fruits and the tithe they get to take of the tree of life for the healing of the nations so there's an exchange taking place these people are supporting life in the city for supporting life in the city what life is in the city it's eternal life the life of jesus christ it's christ and his bride united together in the city it's the elect predestinated seed it is the seed of christ it is the the children of god the attributes of god they're the city dwellers and now in the future home when they bring their tithe and offering to support life in the city because they support life in the city they get to partake of the tree of life to have perpetual life there's an exchange taking place and this exchange matches the very reason why they're there they're there because in life they supported the life whenever they saw it whether they were just good and kind and just to the bride stood up for the bride or was a helper in the work of the ministry and tried to work with the word as much as they knew it whatever reason they were a supporter of life so in the future home they're a supporter of city life and because in their earthly journey they supported the eternal life they were they were allowed to entrance into eternal life because they supported life they got life and now in the city in the future home because they support city life they get life from the tree of life you realize they're not the tree of life they don't have leaves themselves they're getting their life from the tree of life and the tree of life is bridegroom and bride tree united back together again the bible is perfect [Music] perfect there's a question comes in questions and answers from 64. said after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgins be saved or will they be all will they all be lost no see everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is holy still what's he saying when the when when the bride goes up and completely is completely raptured will the foolish virgin will any of them be saved or will they all be lost and brother branham says no they stay what they are he that's righteous is righteous still he is to fill these films he that's holy is holy still so when the bride goes up the spirit leaves when the life the eternal life leaves the earth for the gentiles they can no longer change their status because their status in the book of life depends on how they conduct themselves with eternal life so now when god removes the spirit and removes the life of eternal life from the earth for the gentiles amen now whatever they are is locked they cannot change because now they can't fight the eternal life or now they can't support the eternal life anymore so god is showing us the white throne judgment has everything to do with what you do with eternal life when you come in contact with it you keep the best you can the word that you've come in contact with and are working to help in a ministry or you are good and kind and just to the bride or you stand up for them and defend them for whatever reason what you did with eternal life in life determines what kind of life you have after the white throne judgment and then you just continue doing what you did to get there amen the bible is perfect this message is perfect amen it explains everything so what does that mean what does that mean well i'm still here are you still here that means somebody can still affect the eternal destination because the spirit of god is still here eternal life is still here we're not just here to do whatever we want to do we're here for life friends there's an opportunity at life right here well if somebody rejects that and somebody fights that their name will be taken off that's fine but that's not my focus that's not my that's not what i'm here for i'm here for life i don't have to get in order for somebody to receive life at the white throne judgment they do not have to come to church with me they do not have to believe everything i believe they do not have to confess that they believe malachi 4's brother bram is the fulfillment of that they don't have to to receive life the at the white throne judgment but what they have to do is respect and honor that life that's in me amen that word life that's living through me they must respect it they must honor it amen god has people around you that love you not because you're lovable but there's something in you that they can't resist there's something about you that they they want to do something for you they want to talk to you they want to be kind to you i say don't brush that aside i said let them do it amen let them do a service to you let them be kind to you let them say something nice about say something nice to them so they'll say more nice things about you because and until she's taken out of the way and the spirit of god leaves and there's an opportunity for gentiles amen still to affect their judgment at the white throne judgment and i say oh god i want to see neighbors and co-workers family members and when we get to that city the gate is never closed by day and it's never night there so what does it mean the gate's never closed so that means there's unlimited access unlimited access back and forth oh friends you know we may think because we're the bride of jesus christ we know our position in the city we may feel like anything less than that would be disappointing but i guarantee nobody who gets over to the new heavens and new earth will be disappointed with where they're at if they're out working in a restored paradise they won't be able to wait to come and bring fruits and offerings and tithe into the city and they'll be so excited and listen we we think we think carnally so much we think that they have to walk in and they got to drop a few apples and go over and break off a limb and carry it out no it's an exchange they support life they get life support life get life it's a perpetual non-ending life because they're rewarded for what they did in natural life now in the new heavens and new earth it's just a continuation and nobody's going to be disappointed and nobody's going to feel cheated nobody's going to be robbed everybody is going to be so satisfied because they're going to see the justice of god the kindness of god the mercy and graciousness of our heavenly father you know so many people struggle with the fact that the lamb has taken the book such a struggle if the lamb has taken the book we know the lamb has to take the book or you can't open the seals and he has to open the seals at the time the seventh angel is on the earth there's no way to get around this but brother bam says some other very difficult things now the throne room becomes a judgment seat no more mercy and it becomes it becomes a scary thing but they fail to see that christ is hearing bride form he may have he may have taken the book and he may have opened the seals but he came in bright form and as long as she's still here she's standing in the door she's standing in the gap and she's saying come yes amen come out of her my people and be separate and he'll receive you come unto the water of life and drink come into the fountain of life and drink come the door's still open we're still here amen we have a message of life we're here for life there's still eternal life here well i don't want him to leave it i don't want him to leave the intercessory seat i don't want him to leave hey i want him to leave amen it's time for a transition it's time for him to open the seals no more carriers amen no more confusion now the life has come back into the sea amen and you think somebody doesn't have a chance at eternal life when the fullness has come back the full life of jesus christ and his bride you think that doesn't create opportunity for eternal life when the fullness of his life is here his life is here he is here [Music] i say it's a good thing he took the book because his life is here and if you're being judged on what you do with his life i want all the life here that we can get in as many vessels as we can get it in so that as many people as possible have a message of life preached to them and a demonstration of life demonstrated before them and they have an opportunity at life say god adjust my attitude god take away my jonah thinking take away my jonah attitude take away amen all the wrong thinking and the wrong attitudes help me to be like joseph i'm in the place of god i've been rejected called names lied about misunderstood i've made mistakes we've got all this all this going on but i'm in the place of god and god has me here for life god brought me here for life god has me here for life i'm in this day for life and i have a message of life to reject that is a remaining death but that's not what i'm here for i'm here for life are you here for life oh what a blessed privilege it is to know these things friend there's no more wrestling with somebody and twisting their arm to make them say things they don't believe because somehow they can't they can't come into eternal life if they don't say william branham was a prophet of god i believe malachi 4 revelation 10 7 and now you're twisting people and trying to contort them and force them to confess things they don't even believe now the pressure's off that position and that confession is only for the predestinated elect but there's multitudes that can receive life by how they treat that life when it comes through the vessels of the word that are living in this day say god let me live the life so clear help me not to make it cloudy let my lamp be trimmed let my the globe be clean lord let me live this life and let me be like one of those clear crystal jasper stones in that city shining the light from the inside may it shine out with no obstruction and no cloudiness and no darkness let me and myself not hinder the shining forth of life so i said at the beginning when we catch the vision of this why we're here it's bigger than what we ever thought it means more and on that day of judgment it'll mean more to us then than it's ever meant and i say let's let's have our vision broadened let's fly on eagles wings prophetic wings and fly up above and look at the word until we can take it in perspective and say i want to live completely consecrated to this word i don't want to smudge it dirty it hide it i don't want to do anything because this is life and i want to have a clear clear reflection of the life of jesus christ it has an effect on people friends let's all stand let's pray as the musicians come oh there's so much god is so good you know friends these things have been mysteries for generations and generations but they're so clearly given to us we should be so thankful it should bring such peace and such rest to us knowing that god is a gracious god with great kindness and full of mercy and slow to anger and he repented themselves of evil that should make us smile when we go into work because there's people who are deserving of judgment they're in darkness and they got they they deserve it but yet you've got a message and you've got a message of life and you've got a god that is gracious and full of mercy and with great kindness and slow to anger and you have a message of life and there's an opportunity for life i say god help me to be true to this word not always in word but in life so that others can see the life and they can serve it respect it honor it be kind to it defend it how many people have stood up for you when other people were making fun of you for what you believe how many people said leave him alone leave her alone i wonder what that'll mean on that day of judgment oh we should be thankful for every opportunity and every time we hear something like that we should thank god and say god bless them and remember that at the day of judgment amen god bless you let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for the privilege lord of being here and god it seems almost wrong as mortals to be able to hear these words to know these things that have been mysteries for generations and ages but now lord you just so clearly share it with us you so so clearly show us the word in god and it thrills our hearts and it excites us and ignites in us a greater desire to be more alive than we've ever been a greater desire to be here and be engaged and be life-giving we have greater desire than we've ever had lord god keep us in the right channel with the right attitude let us be like joseph lord and not like jonah let us remember that we're here we're in the place you put us and we're here for a reason and we're here to save life god we love you we ask that you would just forgive us lord of our narrow vision forgive us of our spiritual laziness forgive us lord of your compromise for god we know that's not what you called us to in this day but take all of those things out of us lord let more of your life take come in and manifest more of yourself through us lord and god because of each one of us may there be lives lord that are granted entrance to eternal life because when you lived in us they respected you they honored you in us and you give them entrance into life oh god let us see that lord let us witness it let us rejoice with them on the other side when they come into this the open the open gates of the city and have fellowship with us may we rejoice lord in what you've done in your goodness and your kindness and your mercy and your grace for god those are the attributes that i love and i'm thankful for god may you use us for your glory may you shine your light through us in a greater way than ever before and help us to be more diligent than we've ever been to stay on task for god it matters it matters more than we could imagine help us god we pray take preeminence among us live your life through us as we go from here to the work week lord this coming few days lord may we not forget these things i mean they're not fade away from us may the words that we've heard change our perspective change our attitude change our lives we love you god we ask your blessing in jesus christ's name amen and before we sing i want to ask you to remember us this afternoon we're going to be going over to levi yoders and his families for another service we're going to serve them communion and have feet washing together their first time since they've come into the message so we're looking forward to that be praying for that and also remember the group of youth that are coming back they'll be leaving here shortly and
