========================================

we have the same ministry this is a continuation of the ministry of jesus christ and he came and he gave a ministry a message for life not for condemnation for life brother branham's message was the same because it's the message of christ it's a message for life it's a message of life our message should be the same and we should live for others because that's what he did our life should be for others and say how is your life for others you know go to the soup kitchen and and do all that well we should we should do whatever we can brother bam said if i can do anything to make somebody's life a little bit better i want to do it so if we have opportunity to do good do it that's what the bible said if you have the opportunity to do good do it and do not be weary and well-doing so if you have opportunity do good do good but how can i live for others amen because i can recognize amen that my very existence on this earth is going to prevent a curse from coming upon this earth and as long as i'm here as far as i know there's an opportunity for somebody amen to come to life amen and i want i want to live my life for that reason i want to live my life for that purpose for others so that i have a broader vision of my life not a narrow vision of my life so that i don't get grumpy and cantankerous and down-hardened and become a hermit in my house and hate life and hate the government and stockpile guns and get a bunch of food and hide out in the basement and hate everybody because it's all corrupt and fallen apart amen what have i done i've removed myself from any opportunity that my existence will have on somebody else's eternal destination jesus says i don't pray to take you out of this world but i pray to keep you in the world to keep you while you're in the world amen because you have to be in the world amen but not of the world because your your very existence on this planet is opening a door creating an opportunity because it's a ministry of life
