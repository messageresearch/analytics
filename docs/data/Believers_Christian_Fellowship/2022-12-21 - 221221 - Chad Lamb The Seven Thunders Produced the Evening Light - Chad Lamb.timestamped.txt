[9:23] let's bow our heads together and pray
[9:26] dear Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[9:29] privilege Lord of being here once again
[9:32] God I prayed as we turn our hearts and
[9:35] attention to your word
[9:36] that you would begin to speak to us Lord
[9:39] in a very personal way reveal yourself
[9:41] to us Lord all over again and may we see

[9:48] ourselves and your face may we see you
[9:51] in the mirror the word may we see
[9:53] ourselves in you
[9:55] God so that we might know what it is
[9:57] that you're doing with us in this hour
[9:59] what our purpose is what your plan is
[10:02] God by your spirit may you live that
[10:05] plan through these vessels of clay may
[10:07] you have your way in US Lord take
[10:09] preeminence tonight may you be glorified
[10:12] in all we say and do in Jesus Christ's
[10:14] name we pray amen
[10:17] amen God bless you while we're standing
[10:19] let's take our Bibles
[10:21] and let's go to
[10:24] Revelation chapter 8.
[10:31] I mean let's read Revelation chapter 8
[10:33] verse 1 together
[10:37] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[10:39] there was silence in heaven about the
[10:41] space of half an hour
[10:43] let's go over to Revelation chapter 10
[10:45] then
[10:47] I want to always note and always put in
[10:49] the top of our mind and when brother
[10:51] Branham ties Revelation chapter 8 1
[10:54] which is the opening of the seventh seal
[10:55] he always ties it together with
[10:57] Revelations 10 1-7 so these things go
[11:00] together they're the same portion of
[11:03] scripture Revelations 10 1-7 and I saw
[11:06] another Mighty Angel come down from
[11:08] heaven clothed with the cloud and
[11:10] brother Branham tells us in the seals he
[11:12] said this is Christ the messenger to the
[11:14] church the angel of the Covenant so we
[11:16] know who this is now coming down in
[11:18] Revelations 10. and I saw another Mighty
[11:21] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[11:23] the cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[11:25] head and his face was as it were the son
[11:27] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[11:30] had in his hand a little book open and
[11:32] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[11:34] his left foot upon the Earth and he
[11:36] cried with a loud voice is when a lion
[11:38] roarth when he had cried seven Thunders
[11:41] uttered their voices and when the seven
[11:43] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[11:45] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[11:47] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[11:49] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[11:51] and write them not
[11:53] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[11:55] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[11:57] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[11:59] liveth forever and ever who created the
[12:01] Heaven and the things that therein are
[12:03] and the earth and the things that
[12:05] therein are and the Sea and the things
[12:07] which are therein that there should be
[12:09] time no longer but in the days of the
[12:12] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[12:14] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[12:16] be finished as he hath declared to his
[12:18] servants the prophets amen God bless you
[12:21] as you take your seeds
[12:24] amen if you remember we opened with this
[12:26] passage of scripture last Wednesday so
[12:28] I'm going to be in the same vein of
[12:30] thought I couldn't really break free
[12:31] from it so I just have to continue on
[12:33] and for a subject for a title tonight
[12:35] I'd like to preach on the seven Thunders
[12:38] produced the evening light
[12:40] so the seven and Thunders produce the
[12:42] evening light and like I said last
[12:44] Wednesday last Wednesday was a a lot of
[12:47] review and uh I enjoyed the review amen
[12:50] I always feel bad when it strikes my
[12:52] heart to go over something that we've
[12:53] gone over so many times but I can't help
[12:56] it this is my life this is our life this
[12:58] is where we're at in time and this is
[13:00] who we are these are our scriptures amen
[13:03] and so I just want to go through this
[13:05] again where Revelation chapter 8 1 is
[13:08] the seventh seal and there was silence
[13:10] nothing was said not even a symbol was
[13:12] getting given brother Benham said it was
[13:14] a total mystery with God he didn't even
[13:17] give a symbol what it was showing that
[13:19] there was nothing spoken here there was
[13:21] nothing to give it away it was a
[13:23] complete secret and we know that the
[13:25] great secret amen of the Bible is the
[13:28] coming of the Lord no one knows the the
[13:30] day nor hour nobody knows when he would
[13:33] come God has this all to himself and the
[13:36] same thing's true with the seventh seal
[13:37] they're tied together in the seventh Sea
[13:39] on the coming of the Lord but brother
[13:41] Branham tied this scripture Revelation
[13:43] chapter 8 1 to Revelations 10 1 and the
[13:46] mighty Angel which he said was Christ
[13:48] coming down with an open book in its
[13:51] hand that means that at this point the
[13:53] book is no longer sealed what was sealed
[13:55] in Revelation chapter 5 the lamb has
[13:58] stepped forward to take the book amen
[14:00] and he has loosed to seals and he's come
[14:02] down with an open book in his hand
[14:06] praise God Amen and so remember the Book
[14:09] of Revelation is a book of symbols amen
[14:11] what gets confusing when we get into the
[14:13] Book of Revelations is we try to make it
[14:16] fit a timeline and we try to make it we
[14:18] try to Define everything in physical
[14:21] understanding amen but these are
[14:23] spiritual happenings these are symbols
[14:25] that are given to us to understand
[14:26] something amen so we're we're not in in
[14:30] looking for the coming of Revelations 10
[14:32] 1-7 to be fulfilled we are not looking
[14:35] to see a giant figure coming down from
[14:38] heaven this is this is the mighty Angel
[14:40] this is a spiritual happening
[14:43] right and the book that's open in his
[14:46] hand is the Revelation amen that was
[14:48] sealed before is now open and he's
[14:51] bringing it down amen so it's coming
[14:53] from what was in the back part of God's
[14:55] mind is now coming to be revealed on
[14:57] Earth praise God
[14:59] and so he he cried with a loud voice is
[15:02] when a lion roars and when he did seven
[15:04] Thunders uttered their voices and the
[15:06] Thunder is always the voice of God the
[15:08] Thunder was speaking something something
[15:11] intelligible was spoken something that
[15:13] was understandable was spoken because
[15:16] John was described through the
[15:18] Revelation amen and John picked up his
[15:20] pen to write what he heard the seven
[15:22] Thunders uttered so it meant John
[15:24] understood what it was and could write
[15:26] it down amen but he was told to seal it
[15:29] up amen and this is what brother Brown
[15:30] talks about the seals on the back side
[15:33] of the book amen for years he talks
[15:35] about this as the seals on the back of
[15:37] the book amen he said nothing was wrote
[15:40] about these and he says the seals on the
[15:42] inside and the seals on the outside and
[15:44] it looks as he's talking about two sets
[15:46] of seals and what he's referring to is
[15:48] the Seven Seals that's in Revelation
[15:50] chapter six amen the sixth seals there
[15:52] and then the seventh we find in
[15:53] Revelation chapter eight they were
[15:55] opened in symbol form amen when it
[15:58] opened we saw a white horse in a red
[16:00] horse and a black horse and a Pale Horse
[16:02] and all of these symbols amen but but
[16:05] that was Seven Seals and he calls that
[16:07] the seals on the inside of the book then
[16:09] when he gets here he said in that back
[16:11] part them other seals he has all ways of
[16:13] mentioning this but what he's showing is
[16:15] something was uttered here something was
[16:17] spoke and it was sealed amen and it was
[16:19] seven Thunders that was sealed
[16:22] so we realized brother bam says also he
[16:25] says that there's things that's not he
[16:27] goes he says it's not even written in
[16:29] the Bible at all but then after he comes
[16:31] to it in the Seven Seals he says no that
[16:34] can't be true because Jesus says no man
[16:36] can add to or take away he said it's got
[16:38] to be a revelation that was already in
[16:41] the book but hidden
[16:43] so it's not another Seven Seals amen it
[16:46] was the seven Thunders that were sealed
[16:48] and what did the Thunder say Amen it'll
[16:51] be revealed when this Mighty Angel comes
[16:54] down
[16:56] praise God
[16:58] in the church AIDS book
[17:00] brother Branham says in the later Sean
[17:02] Church age and I love this sentence and
[17:04] I want you to hear exactly the way
[17:06] brother Ben says it it says it was in
[17:08] the end time period that the seven
[17:11] thunders of Jesus came forth
[17:14] now catch that
[17:16] he didn't say the seven Thunders he said
[17:18] it was in the end time period that the
[17:21] seven thunders of Jesus came forth
[17:25] amen so these are the seven thunders of
[17:27] Jesus so who has to bring the Thunders
[17:30] Jesus amen whose Thunders are they
[17:32] they're Jesus's Thunders it's going to
[17:34] take Christ the lamb to bring the
[17:36] Thunders
[17:37] it's going to take the mighty Angel
[17:39] which is Christ these are the seven
[17:41] thunders of Jesus not of William Branham
[17:44] these are the seven thunders of Jesus
[17:46] amen and then he quotes Revelation 10
[17:49] 3-4 and he said he cried with the loud
[17:52] voices when a lion roared and when he
[17:54] had cried seven Thunders under their
[17:55] voices when the seven Thunders had
[17:58] uttered their voices I was about to
[17:59] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[18:00] saying unto me seal up those things with
[18:03] the seven Thunders uttered and write
[18:05] them not what was in those Thunders no
[18:07] one knows but we need to know
[18:11] it's so important we need to know and it
[18:13] will take a prophet to get the
[18:14] Revelation because God has no other way
[18:16] of bringing out his scriptural
[18:18] Revelations except by a prophet
[18:21] so that means if the if the prophet has
[18:24] come amen then the Thunders have been
[18:26] revealed because there's no other option
[18:28] amen
[18:29] praise be to God
[18:31] so in the third seal and I know this is
[18:34] familiar to us but I I'm going to say it
[18:36] anyways amen so you might as well say
[18:38] Amen anyways
[18:41] some of this is going to be familiar but
[18:42] as as we go through familiar territory
[18:44] it always becomes richer more uh deeper
[18:48] it becomes clearer at least for me and
[18:50] in the third seal the prophet of God so
[18:52] now that's what's the reason today the
[18:54] revivals that we're supposed to have
[18:56] we've we have denominational revivals we
[18:59] haven't had a real stirring I'm going to
[19:01] read two quotes that I read last
[19:03] Wednesday amen and and we're going to go
[19:05] from there springboard off of that but
[19:07] this is the same thing we talked about
[19:08] we haven't had a real stirring no no no
[19:11] no no no no sir don't think we got
[19:14] revivals we haven't oh they've got
[19:16] millions and millions and millions of
[19:17] church members but not a Revival nowhere
[19:19] no no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet
[19:22] there's been no Revival there no
[19:25] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[19:27] yet see we're looking for it it will
[19:29] take those seven unknown Thunders back
[19:31] there to wake her up again he will send
[19:34] it he promised it
[19:36] so so Brothers telling us there's been
[19:40] no Revival for the bride there's been
[19:42] church revivals but no Revival to stir
[19:45] the bride amen there's been but it'll
[19:48] take the seven unknown Thunders to he
[19:51] says back there he's talking about at
[19:52] the back part of the book Revelation 10
[19:54] to wake her up again amen so she's
[19:58] sleeping and needs to be awakened and
[20:00] what will awaken her it'll be the seven
[20:02] Thunders
[20:05] then he goes this is that was in the
[20:07] third seal in March of 1963 so in the
[20:10] third seal he's saying there's not been
[20:12] a stirring there's been no the bride
[20:14] hasn't had a Revival it's going to take
[20:16] the seven Thunders to wake her up but
[20:18] then he comes in 1964 in July of 64 and
[20:21] recognizing your day and its message he
[20:23] said one of the finest papers on the
[20:25] field Harold of his coming but they
[20:27] hardly will print anything unless it's
[20:29] about fast pray fast pray sound a
[20:31] trumpet how many reads it you know you
[20:34] see it all the time fast pray it's all
[20:37] you hear fast pray we're going to have a
[20:39] great breaking of the day there's a
[20:41] great thing going to happen all of you
[20:43] pray pray word not too late yet why do
[20:46] they do that why do they do that they
[20:49] want a Great Awakening they're crying
[20:51] believing that there will be an
[20:53] Awakening they're good people why is it
[20:56] what have they done they have not
[20:58] recognized The Awakening of the Bride
[21:01] so he said it'll take those seven
[21:03] Thunders those seven unknown Thunders
[21:05] back there to wake her up then he says
[21:08] they're crying for an Awakening but they
[21:10] haven't recognized amen The Awakening of
[21:13] the Bride so somewhere in that year and
[21:15] four months something happened that will
[21:17] awaken the bride
[21:19] it was The Awakening of the bride and he
[21:21] said it'll take the seven unknown
[21:22] Thunders so the F7 unknown Thunders have
[21:25] to be revealed somewhere in that period
[21:28] of time for The Awakening of the Bride
[21:32] but being Christians they feel the pool
[21:34] of the hour but they haven't recognized
[21:36] what's been done
[21:38] that's what's making them feel that way
[21:40] they know something is supposed to
[21:42] happen but see they're looking for it
[21:44] way off in the future to come when it's
[21:46] already happened right by you
[21:48] and I'd like to say that's still
[21:51] possible to be true today
[21:54] looking for something to happen some
[21:56] stirring some great thing to happen the
[21:58] thing that needs to happen for the bride
[22:00] has happened amen it's awakened the
[22:02] bride she's awake amen and what woke her
[22:05] up is those seven unknown Thunders when
[22:07] they were revealed amen it came to
[22:09] awaken the bride it is the bride's
[22:11] Revival amen it is disturbing for the
[22:14] bride amen so we're not looking for a
[22:16] Revival to come to stir the bride we've
[22:19] had the Revival to stir the bride and to
[22:22] awaken the bride
[22:24] so when we're when somebody's pointing
[22:26] to the Future to the Future to the
[22:28] Future and what what we don't need what
[22:30] comes in the future what we've already
[22:32] received is what is taking us further on
[22:34] Amen this is the thing this is the
[22:36] Awakening of the Bride amen and what are
[22:38] we waiting for not for a stirring we
[22:41] receive the stirring we're waiting for
[22:43] the last seed to get secure in their
[22:45] position amen we're not waiting for a
[22:47] stirring we're waiting for the last one
[22:49] to get locked in
[22:53] it's important to know because if not
[22:55] we're still looking for something
[22:56] looking for something and not taking
[22:58] value in what we've already received
[23:00] amen and not realizing what we need is
[23:02] here
[23:03] what we need is come amen I'm not
[23:06] wanting something to come amen if I keep
[23:08] looking for something to come then what
[23:10] happens when I keep pointing to the
[23:12] Future and not recognizing what's come
[23:15] then I stay in a weakened condition
[23:17] because I don't value what takes me amen
[23:20] through the body change I'm looking for
[23:22] something to happen to take me in the
[23:24] body change when what's come is enough
[23:27] [Music]
[23:29] that's the danger of pointing to Future
[23:32] Revival future stirring future Awakening
[23:35] future happening it's it's dangerous
[23:37] because what it does is take the very
[23:39] power and the Very anointing and the
[23:41] Very Awakening amen that's going to
[23:43] carry the bride all the way through it
[23:45] takes it and diminishes it in the minds
[23:47] of the people looking for something else
[23:49] but we need to go back and find out
[23:51] what's been done what was it that
[23:53] happened between March of 63 and July of
[23:56] 64. what is that because that's the
[23:59] thing that I need
[24:01] pray for me to God
[24:04] let's go to Matthew 25 together
[24:10] now remember last Wednesday we talked
[24:12] about the three pools
[24:14] in
[24:20] Matthew 25
[24:28] Matthew 25 and verse 1.
[24:31] and we talked about the third pool
[24:34] was was the one that catches the rainbow
[24:36] trout
[24:37] the Covenant fish the first two were
[24:40] used to get the attention of the of the
[24:42] rainbow trout but it was the third one
[24:44] that hooked him and caught them amen
[24:46] and so we and we saw that the third pool
[24:49] was the opening of the word and so now
[24:51] we're right in the same vein of thought
[24:53] but let's look here at Matthew 25 verse
[24:57] 1.
[24:58] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be
[25:00] likened to the ten virgins which took
[25:02] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[25:04] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[25:07] and five were foolish they that were
[25:09] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[25:11] with them but the wise took oil in their
[25:14] vessels with their lamps while the
[25:16] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[25:18] and slept so they all slept so there
[25:21] must come an Awakening
[25:23] amen
[25:25] there must come an Awakening of the
[25:27] brine they all slumbered and slept and
[25:29] at midnight there was a cry made behold
[25:31] the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet
[25:33] him then all those virgins arose and
[25:36] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[25:38] unto the wise give us of your oil for
[25:40] our lamps are gone out but the wise
[25:42] answer is saying not so lest there be
[25:44] not enough for us and you but go ye
[25:48] rather to them that sell and buy for
[25:50] yourselves and while they went to buy
[25:52] the bridegroom came
[25:53] and they that were ready went in with
[25:55] him to the marriage and the door was
[25:58] shut afterward came also the other
[26:00] virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but
[26:03] he answered and said verily I say unto
[26:05] you I know you not. amen so so we know
[26:09] this Parable the wise and the foolish
[26:11] virgin brother bam talks about it a lot
[26:13] but what I want to show is that they
[26:15] were all asleep but there was an
[26:16] Awakening there was a Midnight Cry that
[26:19] came and we know the Midnight Cry amen
[26:21] came through the prophet of the age and
[26:24] and it said behold he cometh go out to
[26:26] meet him amen so we find out there's
[26:28] several things going on here that I want
[26:30] to point out one is where they were was
[26:32] in the city amen but when the Midnight
[26:35] Cry come he said behold the bridegroom
[26:37] cometh go out to meet him amen not he's
[26:41] coming all the way into the
[26:42] denominational systems but he's coming
[26:44] you go out of the system and meet him
[26:48] all right amen and that's the hour that
[26:51] we live in when we're leaving the system
[26:53] because the midnight Christ says behold
[26:55] he cometh go out and meet him amen so
[26:58] there's a meeting in between between the
[27:01] marriage supper amen and the coming out
[27:03] of the denominations we meet him and
[27:05] Unite with him and we're walking with
[27:07] him into the marriage supper amen
[27:11] and this is what the prophet of God says
[27:13] in the message proving his word
[27:15] is now we say he's raised from the dead
[27:18] I didn't say it the word here said it
[27:20] they said he raised from the dead he
[27:22] says he's the same yesterday today and
[27:24] forever you believe that he promised
[27:26] these things to happen in the last day
[27:28] that the same son of man will be made
[27:30] manifest
[27:31] now remember that was not Jesus talking
[27:33] to Abraham there that could discern the
[27:36] thoughts and Sarah's mind behind him
[27:37] that was not Jesus he had not yet been
[27:39] born but it was a man in human flesh
[27:41] that Abraham called Elohim the great
[27:43] Almighty
[27:44] and Jesus said as it was in the days of
[27:47] Sodom now watch close in the days of
[27:48] Sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[27:50] son of man when the son of man is being
[27:53] revealed so the coming of the son of man
[27:55] is the same as the revealing of the son
[27:57] of man
[27:59] and the coming of the son of man when
[28:01] the son of man is being revealed not no
[28:04] more as a church see not no more the
[28:07] bride is called see in the day the son
[28:10] of man will be revealed what to join the
[28:13] church to the Head unite the marriage of
[28:17] the Bride the bridegroom call will come
[28:19] right through this so where will the
[28:21] bridegroom call come from from the
[28:23] revealing of the son of man which is
[28:25] Luke 17 30 which is part of the ministry
[28:28] of brother Branham
[28:29] so the revealing of the son of man is
[28:32] the coming of the son of man and the
[28:34] bridegroom call come it comes through
[28:36] this says he cometh go out to meet him
[28:39] go beyond the camp to him he's cometh go
[28:42] to him
[28:44] amen because he's not coming into the
[28:47] churches he stopped dealing with the
[28:49] churches now he's calling for his bride
[28:52] to come stand by his side he's calling
[28:54] us out of the systems to unite with him
[28:58] so the bridegroom call will come right
[29:00] through this so so I want to read this
[29:02] again in the day the son of man will be
[29:05] revealed what to join the church to the
[29:08] Head
[29:09] unite the marriage of the Bride so it's
[29:13] actually a marriage that's taking place
[29:17] not will take place is taking place
[29:21] the bridegroom call will come right
[29:24] through this when the son of man will
[29:26] come down and come in human flesh to
[29:28] unite the two together the church has to
[29:31] be the word he is the word and the two
[29:34] unites together and to do that it'll
[29:36] take the manifestation of the revealing
[29:38] of the son of man not a clergy man I
[29:41] don't know do you see what I mean it's
[29:43] the son of man Jesus Christ will come
[29:45] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[29:48] make his word so real that it'll unite
[29:51] the church in him as one the bride and
[29:54] then shall go home to the wedding supper
[29:56] amen she's already United see we go to
[29:59] the wedding supper not to the marriage
[30:02] right so now there's a through the
[30:05] revealing of the son of man amen which
[30:08] is Jesus Christ coming and revealing
[30:10] himself through that prophetic office
[30:12] amen that that is will do what unite the
[30:16] church and the head together amen what
[30:18] it'll do it'll bring the marriage
[30:20] together it's the bridegroom call saying
[30:23] come out from among her keys come now go
[30:26] to him
[30:28] and then there's a spiritual union an
[30:30] invisible Union of the Bride amen in
[30:33] Christ and then he's taking her into the
[30:36] marriage supper so where are we now
[30:38] we're United with Christ on our journey
[30:40] to the marriage supper what are we
[30:42] waiting for we're waiting for the last
[30:43] one to unite with Christ the last one to
[30:46] come out and be United amen
[30:50] so where am I I'm not there
[30:53] and I'm not yet there I'm in between
[30:57] praise God
[31:01] now
[31:02] so the bridegroom call
[31:06] is the Midnight Cry
[31:09] it's the Awakening of the Bride it's the
[31:11] cry that wakes her up and tells her he's
[31:15] come the bridegroom cometh go out to
[31:17] meet him
[31:18] and then they unite and he takes her
[31:21] into the marriage feast
[31:24] now
[31:25] in the seventh seal
[31:28] brother REM says now do you notice on
[31:30] the opening of the seventh seal it's
[31:32] also in a threefold mystery
[31:35] this one I have will speak and have
[31:38] spoke that it's the mystery of the seven
[31:40] Thunders
[31:42] now listen he's saying those the opening
[31:45] of the seventh seal
[31:46] is in a threefold mystery and I'm going
[31:48] to speak
[31:50] or half spoke that on one of them it's
[31:53] the mystery of the seven thunder so the
[31:55] mystery of the seven Thunders and the
[31:57] opening of the seventh seal go together
[32:01] the seven thunders in heaven will unfold
[32:03] this mystery
[32:05] the seven thunders in heaven will unfold
[32:07] this mystery it'll be right at the
[32:10] coming of Christ because Christ said no
[32:12] one knew when he would return
[32:14] did you notice when the Jews asked him
[32:16] that you know when we compared the
[32:18] scriptures here with Matthew 24 with the
[32:20] six seals the seventh was left out
[32:22] because you see Christ said only God
[32:25] himself no not even the angels no wonder
[32:27] it wasn't even written you see they
[32:29] hushed nothing taking place Angels don't
[32:32] know it nobody knows when he's coming
[32:34] but they'll be there'll be seven voices
[32:37] of these seven Thunders that will reveal
[32:40] the great Revelation at that time
[32:43] what is it his coming what will reveal
[32:46] it the seven voices of the seven
[32:47] Thunders so do we wait for those no
[32:50] because it'll take a prophet amen and
[32:52] the prophets already come so it's
[32:53] already been done she's already been
[32:55] awakened she's already been called
[32:57] through the midnight call to go out and
[32:59] join with him and be United with him by
[33:01] what by the voice of the seven Thunders
[33:05] what is that the seventh seal the coming
[33:08] of the Lord amen it's all tied together
[33:12] praise God brother Franco if you could
[33:14] bring up the Whiteboard I'm going to
[33:15] write on that for just a second so he
[33:18] says the angels I want to read this
[33:20] again so we can catch the context he
[33:22] said Christ said only God himself known
[33:25] not even the angels no wonder it wasn't
[33:26] even written what was it written the
[33:29] seventh seal Revelations 8 1 silence in
[33:32] heaven there's not even a symbol amen
[33:34] then you go to the seven Thunders they
[33:35] uttered John was going to write he said
[33:37] seal it up those are the two things that
[33:39] are not even written they're the same
[33:40] thing
[33:42] not even written Angels don't know it
[33:45] God themselves the only one who knowed
[33:47] it amen no wonder it wasn't even written
[33:49] you see they hush nothing taken place
[33:51] then Angels don't know it nobody knows
[33:53] when he's coming but there'll be seven
[33:55] voices of the seven Thunders that will
[33:57] reveal the great Revelation at that time
[34:01] oh praise God
[34:04] it's so simple it goes over the heads of
[34:07] Millions
[34:08] but there's a simple little bride
[34:10] remember when we said when we when we
[34:12] talked last time we preached on brother
[34:14] Branham opening a god hiding himself in
[34:16] Simplicity revealing himself in the same
[34:18] he started with the scripture who hath
[34:21] believed our report and who has seen the
[34:22] arm of the Lord revealed and brother
[34:24] random answers that those who believe
[34:26] the report have seen the arm of the Lord
[34:28] revealed the very power of God is coming
[34:31] this day how has it come it's come if
[34:33] you believe that prophets report amen if
[34:36] you believe what he's telling you it's
[34:38] the revelation of the arm of the Lord
[34:39] that's been extended to the bride it is
[34:42] the power it is the quickening power it
[34:44] is the line it is what we need to finish
[34:46] the journey
[34:49] amen
[34:51] so I'll read that again there'll be
[34:52] seven voices of these seven Thunders
[34:54] that will reveal the great Revelation at
[34:55] that time so I believe if we don't know
[34:58] it if we it won't be no till that time
[35:01] but it will be revealed in that day in
[35:05] the hour that it's supposed to be
[35:06] revealed in
[35:08] that's very cryptic
[35:10] so when will it be revealed
[35:13] in the hour that it's supposed to be
[35:14] revealed
[35:16] but when is that it'll be revealed in
[35:18] that day and the hour that it's supposed
[35:21] to be revealed in
[35:22] and and the reason it's cryptic and
[35:25] we'll get to that in a minute the reason
[35:27] it's cryptic is because it it was open
[35:32] in 1963.
[35:34] but it's still being revealed as
[35:36] individuals come to the revelation of
[35:38] the seven Thunders
[35:40] so it's being revealed in the hour that
[35:42] it's supposed to be revealed in
[35:45] for me it was a different hour than you
[35:48] for some of you it was several many
[35:50] years ago for some of us it was more
[35:52] recently but it's being revealed in the
[35:54] hour that it's supposed to be revealed
[35:56] in don't worry it's not going to Mrs
[35:58] Mark amen and you say is it revealed
[36:01] well it still might not be revealed to
[36:04] the last seed
[36:06] but it'll be revealed in the hour
[36:08] supposed to be revealed and to them amen
[36:10] remember we're not talking church
[36:12] anymore we're talking individuals he's
[36:15] coming to individuals to reveal himself
[36:17] to a bride and they're going to catch
[36:19] the bride call as an individual I wasn't
[36:21] even alive when the bride call was being
[36:24] made amen and when it was open amen but
[36:27] I heard the bride call many years later
[36:29] but it was fresh for me
[36:32] and that was the hour it was supposed to
[36:34] be revealed to me
[36:37] so brother Brown says things sometimes
[36:40] very cryptic but it matches exactly
[36:42] perfectly where we're at
[36:46] amen if if we make everything uh uh
[36:51] started and completed in 1963 then all
[36:54] of us born after that have no chance
[36:56] amen
[36:59] praise be to God
[37:01] amen
[37:04] so I'm going to write down something
[37:06] here
[37:08] so the
[37:09] let's just write this seven
[37:14] Thunders
[37:16] equals
[37:18] seventh seal
[37:21] we got another equal sign but I'll read
[37:23] a quote and we'll do something else
[37:26] now in the church age book the latest in
[37:28] church age
[37:29] says now this messenger of Malachi 4
[37:33] and Revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[37:35] things
[37:36] one according to Malachi 4 he will turn
[37:38] the hearts of the children to the
[37:39] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[37:42] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[37:43] which are the revelations contained in
[37:46] the Seven Seals
[37:47] it will be these divinely revealed
[37:49] mystery truths that literally turn the
[37:51] hearts of the children to the
[37:52] Pentecostal fathers
[37:54] so the messenger Malachi 4 in Revelation
[37:56] 10 7 is brother William Branham
[38:00] and he will reveal the mysteries of the
[38:03] seven Thunders so are the mysteries of
[38:05] the Thunders revealed absolutely that's
[38:08] the bridegroom call amen that that that
[38:10] is the Awakening of the Bride that that
[38:12] is the revelation of his coming it's all
[38:15] revealed under that
[38:17] okay
[38:18] now questions and answers uh from 1964
[38:22] August of 1964 questions and answers
[38:24] there's a question comes in that says
[38:26] have the seven Thunders which equal
[38:28] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[38:31] were they revealed in the Seven Seals
[38:32] but are yet but are yet not known to us
[38:35] as the Thunders yet
[38:37] he said no
[38:38] they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[38:41] that's what the Thunders was about
[38:45] what the the revelation of Zeus when he
[38:48] preached the seals that's what the
[38:49] Thunders was about
[38:51] they was the seven Thunders that had
[38:54] uttered their voices and no one could
[38:55] make out what it was John knew what it
[38:58] was but he was forbidden to write it he
[39:00] said but the seventh angel in the days
[39:02] of his sounding the seven Mysteries of
[39:04] the seven Thunders would be revealed and
[39:07] the seventh angel is the messenger of
[39:09] the seventh Church age Amen brother
[39:10] random makes it so clear you cannot miss
[39:13] it amen the seven Thunders were revealed
[39:15] what was the preaching of the seals
[39:16] that's what it was all about that's what
[39:18] the Thunders was about the Revelation in
[39:20] the seals
[39:22] and that's tied to the seventh seal
[39:26] now this is what he says next
[39:29] in the seventh seal
[39:31] did you notice when the Jews asked him
[39:33] you know when we compare the scriptures
[39:35] here with Matthew 24 with the six seals
[39:37] the seventh seal was left out because
[39:39] you see Christ said only God himself no
[39:41] not even the angels no wonder it wasn't
[39:43] even written you see they hush nothing
[39:45] taken place the Angels don't know nobody
[39:48] knows when he's coming
[39:50] we read this earlier we're reading again
[39:51] nobody knows when he's coming there'll
[39:54] be seven voices of those Thunders that
[39:56] will reveal the great Revelation at that
[39:58] time so the seventh seal and the Seven
[40:01] Thunders go together
[40:04] now let's keep reading same quote
[40:10] so I believe if we don't know it it
[40:13] won't be no till that time but it will
[40:16] be revealed in that day in the hour that
[40:18] it's supposed to be revealed in that's
[40:19] as far as we read the quote before but
[40:21] now we're going further so the thing for
[40:23] us to do is to be reverent before God
[40:25] and serve him and do all that we know
[40:27] how to do and live good Christian lives
[40:30] here now we find that the Sixth Seal has
[40:32] been open to us we see it and we know
[40:34] that the seventh seal cannot be broke to
[40:37] the public until the hour arrives
[40:39] now there was some reason that God let
[40:41] those seven voices be thundered because
[40:43] it must come for we find now listen to
[40:46] where he's going to tie this together we
[40:48] find that Christ the lamb took the book
[40:50] in his hand and he opened the seventh
[40:52] seal
[40:54] was he talking about the seven Thunders
[40:56] now he's talking about Christ opening
[40:57] the seventh seal amen
[41:00] but you see it's a hidden mystery no one
[41:02] knows it but it's right along with what
[41:04] he said no one would know is coming they
[41:06] also would not know about the seventh
[41:08] under mystery so you see it's connected
[41:12] together so what's connected together
[41:14] the revelation of the seven Thunders
[41:16] which are the Mysteries contained the
[41:18] revelations and the Seven Seals is
[41:20] connected with the seventh seal which is
[41:22] his coming
[41:25] die amen and listen he didn't come with
[41:29] only six open seals that little book was
[41:31] open
[41:34] him coming is the seventh seal amen and
[41:37] he's the one who revealed the six seals
[41:41] so now in 1965 and July of 1965 and the
[41:45] message anointed ones at the end time
[41:47] says notice the very day when this
[41:49] messenger not when he starts on but he
[41:52] when he begins to declare his message
[41:54] the first pull healing second pull
[41:56] prophesying third pulled the opening of
[41:59] the word
[42:00] the Mysteries revealed
[42:03] no more there is no more higher order to
[42:06] reveal the word than prophets but the
[42:08] only way the prophet can then be
[42:10] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[42:12] now this is what I want to hone in on
[42:15] the third pull was the opening of them
[42:18] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[42:20] that's been sealed in the word
[42:24] so the seven Thunders equals the seventh
[42:26] seal
[42:29] equals the third pool
[42:34] and that's a simplistic way to write it
[42:36] we know there's a lot of details we can
[42:38] go into a lot of things there's a lot
[42:39] more information there but these things
[42:42] are all linked together
[42:45] and the whole point was for us to
[42:47] realize to see and the whole reason I
[42:50] want to go through this again is see
[42:52] that we're not deferring to some future
[42:54] event amen what's what's needed to
[42:57] happen has happened but what's happening
[42:59] is it's becoming a reality to each
[43:01] member of the body one by one amen it's
[43:04] being revealed in the hour that it must
[43:06] be revealed and may it be revealed to
[43:08] you in this hour may it be tonight if it
[43:10] hasn't struck home yet May a strike home
[43:13] tonight amen because this is the
[43:15] Revelation that the bride needs to be
[43:17] awake amen and be active and be be
[43:19] moving out of the denomination you say
[43:22] brother Chad I'm not in the denomination
[43:23] amen if you've not caught this
[43:26] Revelation we're still stuck in Old
[43:28] traditional thinking in our own thinking
[43:29] but he's come to break us out of that
[43:32] and call us out of that to unite with
[43:34] him the word
[43:36] no more partial but full reality amen no
[43:39] more our own ideas but the Revelation
[43:41] that he brought in this hour amen so
[43:44] that he can Unite with us so that he can
[43:46] live his life through us
[43:50] amen so there's a tremendous power in
[43:53] this Revelation the reason that I want
[43:56] to go over it again and again and again
[43:58] is not it's not because it's interesting
[44:02] facts it's not because it's it's
[44:04] interesting to teach and to know and for
[44:06] intellectual reasons it's because it has
[44:09] the very power to break us free it is
[44:12] the very arm of God that's extended to
[44:14] us it's the very thing that makes us
[44:16] recognize I don't have to wait I don't
[44:18] have to defer I don't need something
[44:20] else what I need is here what I need is
[44:23] come I have United with the word and it
[44:26] is the power of God to bring every
[44:28] manifestation that must be made in this
[44:30] hour I don't need to wait for something
[44:32] else I have what I need what I need has
[44:35] come I have United with the person of
[44:37] the word and nothing is impossible now
[44:39] nothing is impossible
[44:43] we don't catch this Revelation we're
[44:46] hoping for something else something new
[44:48] something more to bring me no what I
[44:51] need is for this to become more of a
[44:53] reality to me I need to become more part
[44:56] of my life part of my thinking part of
[44:58] my reaction
[44:59] I needed to move from here to here I
[45:01] need to be more than understanding I
[45:03] needed to be my very life blood that I
[45:05] know who I am where I am what I'm doing
[45:08] on this Earth whose I am and who is
[45:10] living in me
[45:13] no we're not biting time for the next
[45:16] event
[45:18] this is the event
[45:21] this is the event Christ uniting with
[45:24] his bride him coming in the formation of
[45:26] his bride the very life of Jesus Christ
[45:29] all that God was he poured into Christ
[45:31] all that Christ was he's born into his
[45:33] church so the fullness of the godhead is
[45:35] to be bin bodied bodied on this Earth in
[45:39] a mini-membered bride and that bride is
[45:41] being woke up by the bridegroom call of
[45:44] the seven thunders of the third pool of
[45:46] the seventh seal however you want to
[45:48] word it but it's this Revelation that's
[45:50] been locked amen that God is unlocked in
[45:52] this day so that she will recognize I'm
[45:55] not a church member amen I'm not part of
[45:57] a system I am one individual that God
[46:01] has called I am a part of God I am a
[46:03] part of Christ and Christ is living in
[46:05] me
[46:08] then when we get into trouble now we're
[46:10] not looking for something else to help
[46:11] us out of trouble when I need to help
[46:13] and help me out of trouble has already
[46:15] United with me
[46:17] when I heard the bridegroom call and
[46:20] left everything else and ran out to
[46:22] unite with him in the marriage then then
[46:24] the one I have need of is in me
[46:28] now I'm not crying out to bring him down
[46:30] he's in me
[46:33] praise be to God
[46:36] oh praise God
[46:40] there's something so powerful
[46:43] and the believer's quiet confidence in
[46:46] who they are
[46:48] not somebody who Frets and runs all over
[46:51] the place every time there's trouble but
[46:52] somebody who says you know what
[46:55] I know I know who I am
[46:59] I know the hour I live in I know where
[47:02] the manifestation is
[47:07] I I know where the word is
[47:11] and I can hold steady
[47:14] and let the word that I'm married to
[47:16] perform a miracle in my life
[47:21] let's go to Zechariah 14.
[47:35] what's amazing to me
[47:38] that it's so simple
[47:41] when the Revelation really strikes and
[47:43] we see it can seem complicated because
[47:45] there's lots of terms and there's so
[47:47] many ways we could describe it and
[47:48] there's so many things that go with this
[47:50] it's the whole Bible
[47:52] it's the whole message there's so many
[47:53] ways we can talk about the same thing in
[47:55] so many terms we can use for the same
[47:57] thing the same event but for me it's
[48:00] really so very very simple that you look
[48:03] at and say well that can't be it
[48:05] but that's it
[48:08] you know the coming of the Lord when
[48:10] Jesus Christ came to Earth it was so
[48:11] simple it was a baby a man who was
[48:14] birthed from a mother and and a stable
[48:17] laying there and in a manger and poor
[48:20] Shepherds poor literate Shepherds amen
[48:22] we're told by angels that it was there
[48:24] and they're the ones running through the
[48:25] town poor illiterate Shepherds
[48:28] not priests not not not not not
[48:30] individuals who were respected not those
[48:33] who had a good reputation or those that
[48:34] would be trustworthy or people would
[48:36] listen to
[48:37] but poor literate Shepherds were running
[48:39] through Bethlehem and saying guess what
[48:41] happened Angels talked to us and told us
[48:43] that Messiah is in that stable over
[48:46] there go past the cow move around the
[48:49] sheep look beyond the donkey and down in
[48:51] there that's the Messiah that's Christ
[48:53] the lord
[48:55] that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah's
[48:57] prophecy it's all right there and it's
[48:59] so simple it's so it's it's an actual
[49:02] baby laying down wrapped in swaddling
[49:05] cloth the the the cloth off a yoke of
[49:08] oxen and laying there in a teenage
[49:10] mother holding it and you look at that
[49:12] and say that can't be what Isaiah was
[49:14] talking about but that's exactly what
[49:16] Isaiah was talking about
[49:18] and in this day you'd be like no no no
[49:20] amen that that that man from Kentucky
[49:23] with a seventh grade education amen
[49:25] every day meeting an angel in a room
[49:27] amen that's giving him the revelation of
[49:29] the Seven Seals that can't indicate the
[49:31] coming of the Lord but it is the
[49:33] indication of the coming of the lord
[49:35] it's the very thing that shows he's here
[49:37] that he's come that the mighty Angel has
[49:39] come down to take dominion over the
[49:42] Beast of the sea and over the Beast of
[49:44] the land and he's taking dominion over
[49:46] everything
[49:48] where is he at he's coming in people he
[49:51] was there in that Prophet that day amen
[49:53] he was there giving out the revelation
[49:55] of the Seven Seals it wasn't he it was a
[49:58] son of man revealing the son of man it
[50:00] was Christ Jesus he had already broken
[50:03] the seals and was opening the seals it
[50:05] wasn't that man it was Christ in the man
[50:07] and it was so simple you said that can't
[50:09] be the coming of the Lord but it is the
[50:11] coming of the Lord
[50:14] amen
[50:16] and who does he get the talent
[50:18] illiterate
[50:20] unrespected unknown uneducated they're
[50:24] the ones who believe the message of the
[50:26] angel
[50:28] and say that's exactly what's taking
[50:30] place what it was prophesied what was
[50:33] talked about what they've looked for for
[50:35] thousands of years was in that stable
[50:37] well we've looked for thousands of years
[50:39] has come amen
[50:41] where is it it's in me how do you know I
[50:45] heard the bridegroom call something woke
[50:47] me up stirred me into action caused me
[50:50] to leave everything that I thought was
[50:52] right I abandoned and I ran out to unite
[50:54] with him and now I'm walking with him to
[50:57] the married sub
[51:00] that can't be it brother Chad
[51:06] I don't know
[51:08] maybe we're still waiting for the hour
[51:10] that it'll be revealed
[51:12] to you
[51:15] because it'll be revealed in the hour
[51:16] it's supposed to be revealed
[51:19] [Music]
[51:22] Zechariah 14 and 6.
[51:27] and it shall come to pass in that day
[51:30] that the light shall not be clear nor
[51:32] dark
[51:33] but it should be one day which shall be
[51:35] known to the Lord not day nor night but
[51:38] it shall come to pass that at evening
[51:40] time it shall be light brother Branham
[51:43] refers to the scripture over and over
[51:45] and he talks about our day and in the
[51:47] evening time at the setting of the Sun
[51:50] at the finishing of time at the end of
[51:52] the church dispensations it shall be
[51:54] light
[51:58] and
[52:00] and remember I the title is the seven
[52:02] Thunders produced the evening light
[52:06] and questions and answers in 1961
[52:08] brother Graham says you take the
[52:10] creatures that roam at night roaches and
[52:11] beetles and bugs and things let the sun
[52:14] rise or let a light flash on watch how
[52:16] they take for Darkness that's the way
[52:18] the gospel is when it flashes on what
[52:20] happens to those who wants to call you
[52:22] Holy Roller what happens to those people
[52:24] who make fun of you when the light
[52:25] flashes on they shoot for Darkness as
[52:27] hard as they can go because they're the
[52:29] children of the ninth but the children
[52:31] of the day walk in the light
[52:35] let's go to first Thessalonians together
[52:36] first Thessalonians chapter five I want
[52:39] to read two scriptures here back to back
[52:41] first Thessalonians chapter 5
[52:46] and verse 1.
[52:52] first Thessalonians
[52:54] 5-1 but of the times in the seasons
[52:57] Brethren you you have no need that I
[52:59] write unto you
[53:00] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[53:02] day of the Lord is so cometh as a thief
[53:04] in the night
[53:05] for when they shall say peace and safety
[53:07] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[53:09] as travail upon a woman with child and
[53:12] they shall not Escape
[53:13] but G Brethren are not in darkness
[53:17] this whole world is in darkness and
[53:19] they're going to enter and travail
[53:21] they're entering and now frankly
[53:25] but you're not in darkness
[53:28] that the day should overtake you as a
[53:30] thief
[53:31] you are all the children of light and
[53:34] the children of the day we are not of
[53:36] the night nor of the darkness
[53:39] so there are two type of children
[53:40] they're Children of the day and Children
[53:42] of the light and Children of the Night
[53:43] and Children of the darkness
[53:45] Children of the darkness flourish and
[53:48] lack of light
[53:50] Children of the day flourish in the
[53:53] light
[53:55] makes sense
[53:57] brother bear says in in the message
[53:58] Christ is revealed in his own word
[54:00] said the blindness of a bat you could
[54:02] turn on a light and the bat would be so
[54:05] blind he couldn't fly
[54:07] a hoot owl all those night Prowlers and
[54:09] things like that roaches and things
[54:10] can't see in the daytime they don't know
[54:13] what it's all about they can't see and
[54:16] the evening lights has come on every
[54:19] Parable everywhere we go to Nature to
[54:21] the Bible the statues the uh that Daniel
[54:24] saw the king of that day all of them saw
[54:26] and all these things everybody every
[54:28] form every move every place in the body
[54:30] positionally shows us the very hour that
[54:32] we're living in not another move can
[54:34] come above it there was a move of the
[54:37] hand charity Wesley there was a move of
[54:39] foundation Luther charity there never
[54:41] was a greater it was called the Wesleyan
[54:43] move they sent missionaries to all the
[54:45] world one of the greatest moves that was
[54:46] made in the age before that
[54:49] then came the Pentecostal age then came
[54:51] in the different fingers and things the
[54:54] Pentecostal age of tongues and nose and
[54:55] so forth now it's in the eyes which is
[54:58] prophetic
[54:59] what good will you need eyes or need
[55:01] light if the eye wasn't there to see
[55:05] there has to be eyes first so you have
[55:07] to have a prophet on the scene first
[55:09] before you can turn on the light
[55:11] simple
[55:13] and then when that comes he opened the
[55:16] Seven Seals and revealed the evening
[55:18] light
[55:21] when what comes when the prophet is here
[55:23] then he opened the Seven Seals and
[55:25] revealed the evening light take all the
[55:27] Mysteries that's been hid down through
[55:29] these Church ages now revealed them as
[55:30] he promised to do in Revelations 10 1-7
[55:34] here we are today sitting in the midst
[55:37] of the word and the word being revealed
[55:39] to us by Jesus Christ
[55:43] who's revealing the word Jesus Christ
[55:47] amen
[55:49] so
[55:50] we see when the eyes showed up when the
[55:54] prophet was here he opened the seals and
[55:57] revealed the evening light so the the
[55:59] the the the uh revealing of the seven
[56:02] Thunders brought the evening light
[56:07] but the light only is good for a child
[56:10] of the day
[56:12] a creature of the night can't see
[56:15] a creature of the night is Blinded by
[56:18] the Light
[56:21] just like a child of the day can't see
[56:24] at night a child of the night can't see
[56:26] in the day
[56:28] so the light is actually blinding
[56:31] remember the Apostle Paul he was Saul
[56:34] before he was born he was Saul and and
[56:37] he thought he was walking in the light
[56:38] he thought he could see come up under
[56:40] the school of Gamaliel he had a great
[56:42] education he knew the Scrolls he knew
[56:44] the scriptures he needed the prophets he
[56:46] knew it all but when he met the pillar
[56:48] of fire that light of that day blinded
[56:50] him amen God had to let him know you
[56:53] can't see amen with that understanding
[56:55] you can't see and God actually had to
[56:58] open his eyes amen through the body in
[57:01] that day because when when that Pillar
[57:03] of Fire spoke to him he said Paul Saul
[57:05] Saul why persecute us now me he said who
[57:07] are you Lord he said I'm crying Jesus
[57:10] whom you persecuted and he wasn't
[57:12] touching Jesus The Man from Nazareth he
[57:14] was touching his body which was the
[57:16] church
[57:18] and so the the light of the day smoking
[57:22] blind amen so God could show him that
[57:25] you can't see
[57:27] you think you see but you can't see then
[57:29] he used the very Body of Christ to open
[57:31] his eyes
[57:33] so the The Children of the Night cannot
[57:36] see the light they're blind to it
[57:40] so the light can be shining bright but
[57:42] they can't see it
[57:44] we can't make them see it
[57:47] you have to be made able to see it by
[57:50] God you have to be the right kind of
[57:52] child to see it
[57:54] you can't make somebody see it the light
[57:58] that's shining will blind those who are
[58:00] not predestinated to see it
[58:04] and the message the power of God he said
[58:06] Here Comes the Army here comes the Army
[58:08] and the dust of roaring and when Moses
[58:10] Stood Still to see the salvation of God
[58:12] the great Pillar of Fire that was
[58:14] hanging before them had led them into
[58:16] this trap moved went over and stood
[58:18] between Israel and Pharaoh's Army and
[58:20] they had rejected the light and any man
[58:23] who rejects the light receives the same
[58:25] thing they did it became midnight
[58:27] Blackness to them the same light that
[58:30] made a light for the children of Israel
[58:31] to walk by blinded the eyes of pharaoh
[58:34] in his army
[58:35] this same Revelation that lets us know
[58:38] the day we live in is the very same
[58:40] Revelation that blinds the eyes of
[58:42] others
[58:46] in the crisis the mystery of God
[58:47] revealed he says notice the anointed man
[58:52] Christ himself here oh God has made
[58:54] known look but he has the preeminence as
[58:57] God fully manifested in Jesus Christ
[58:59] God's Great secret of his Revelation
[59:01] this great light of Revelation is always
[59:04] blinded the wisdom of this world
[59:06] in the days of Jesus Christ when he was
[59:09] here on Earth they had blinded them they
[59:12] said why you even make yourself God
[59:14] you you make yourself equal with God and
[59:17] because of that they wanted to Stone him
[59:20] right
[59:22] brother says he was not only equal with
[59:24] God he was God himself see they don't
[59:27] get it
[59:29] everything the prophet said he was he
[59:32] was amen everything was prophesied him
[59:34] he was there in the flesh fulfilling his
[59:37] own word amen but the light of Jesus
[59:40] Christ blinded their eyes and they said
[59:43] you make yourself equal to God he wasn't
[59:45] just equal to God he was God and they
[59:47] wanted to kill the very one that they
[59:49] claimed to worship because the light
[59:51] blinded them
[59:53] praise God
[59:55] but there was thankfully some who could
[59:58] see
[1:00:01] so you see
[1:00:03] the night creatures or Children of the
[1:00:06] Night
[1:00:08] they flourish I should say this in the
[1:00:11] Moonlight
[1:00:13] is that right
[1:00:14] so in the cycle of night under the moon
[1:00:18] dispensations
[1:00:20] which is the church ages
[1:00:23] the the children of the night they can
[1:00:26] flourish
[1:00:27] right
[1:00:29] the children of the day they just just
[1:00:32] enough light to keep moving forward
[1:00:35] but the Children of the Night can
[1:00:37] flourish that's why they don't want to
[1:00:40] leave the church age dispensation
[1:00:42] because it's under Moonlight and the
[1:00:45] laodicean age is just a sliver of light
[1:00:48] going into total darkness which is great
[1:00:50] for a creature of the night
[1:00:53] so they don't want to leave that church
[1:00:55] dispensation because they can see there
[1:00:58] amen but when they get into the light
[1:01:00] their blind as a bat brother Branham
[1:01:02] said so they don't want to leave where
[1:01:04] they can see because when they step out
[1:01:06] of that they can't see nothing makes
[1:01:08] sense I can't find my way I can't get
[1:01:10] oriented foreign
[1:01:13] but the children of the day when they
[1:01:16] finally slip out of that laodicea in
[1:01:18] darkness they finally come into the day
[1:01:20] and say praise God I can see now it
[1:01:23] makes sense to me now I understand now I
[1:01:26] know why I've always felt this way now I
[1:01:28] know why I always wanted this and loved
[1:01:30] this and didn't love that now I know who
[1:01:32] I am and where I came from and where I'm
[1:01:35] going to and why the prophet said
[1:01:37] everything he said praise God thanks for
[1:01:39] the light
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:42] but the children the church age Children
[1:01:44] of the darkness want to stay in darkness
[1:01:47] because that's where they flourish
[1:01:50] that's where they can see that's where
[1:01:53] the Bible makes sense to them
[1:01:57] but to us there was always questions
[1:02:00] why this and why that and why and it
[1:02:04] doesn't I don't understand this I don't
[1:02:06] understand that and when God turned on
[1:02:08] the light at the opening of The Seven
[1:02:09] Thunders and we stepped into the light
[1:02:11] all of a sudden that's why and that's
[1:02:14] why and that's why that's why the fall
[1:02:18] in the garden had to be covered by Blood
[1:02:20] that's why there had to be a human
[1:02:22] sacrifice that's why I feel the way I do
[1:02:26] praise be to God
[1:02:28] I thank God he's turned on the lights
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:33] let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 4
[1:02:36] together
[1:02:42] second Corinthians chapter four
[1:02:48] verse 3.
[1:02:52] second Corinthians 4 and 3 but if our
[1:02:54] gospel be hid it is hid to them that are
[1:02:57] lost
[1:02:58] and whom the God of this world has
[1:03:00] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:03:02] not lest the light of the Glorious
[1:03:03] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[1:03:06] which shine unto them for we preach not
[1:03:08] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:03:10] ourselves your servants for Jesus
[1:03:13] Christ's sake
[1:03:14] for God who commanded the light to shine
[1:03:16] out of Darkness has shined in our hearts
[1:03:18] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:03:20] the glory of God and the face of Jesus
[1:03:22] Christ why because Christ is the mystery
[1:03:25] of God revealed
[1:03:27] it's what this ties to
[1:03:29] but we have this treasure what treasure
[1:03:32] this Revelation in the face of Jesus
[1:03:35] Christ of God we have this treasure
[1:03:37] where in Earth and vessels
[1:03:40] where is this treasure it's in me
[1:03:43] where is this Revelation in me where is
[1:03:46] this light turned on in me amen we have
[1:03:49] this treasure in Earth and vessels that
[1:03:50] the Excellency of the power may be of
[1:03:52] God and not of us
[1:03:55] it wasn't us it's him
[1:03:59] praise God
[1:04:00] oh I love the word
[1:04:03] brother remember says in the unveiling
[1:04:05] of God he says now someone
[1:04:08] many has been saying to me and
[1:04:10] theologians said brother Branham
[1:04:12] if the Lord God said if with your
[1:04:15] experience that the Lord has given you
[1:04:16] for his people humbly saying this said
[1:04:18] you would be eligible to write a Bible
[1:04:20] yourself your word if God has manifested
[1:04:23] I said that might be true see he was
[1:04:25] trying to catch me
[1:04:27] and I said but you see I couldn't do
[1:04:29] that he said why couldn't you you have
[1:04:32] all the qualifications I said but you
[1:04:34] look one word cannot be added or taken
[1:04:36] away see
[1:04:37] he said well then them seven Thunders
[1:04:39] you said when them seven Thunders
[1:04:41] blasting out won't that be a revelation
[1:04:43] be given to some man
[1:04:45] I said no sir it would be adding
[1:04:47] something to it or taking something from
[1:04:49] it
[1:04:50] it's all revealed in there
[1:04:53] and the Seven Seals opened up the
[1:04:55] revelation of what that was
[1:04:58] that's why when brother Branham went to
[1:04:59] the seven Thunders when he went to
[1:05:01] Revelation 10 1-7 amen when he went back
[1:05:04] he went back and interpreted what the
[1:05:06] Seven Seals when it was in symbol form
[1:05:08] what it was talking about it was already
[1:05:10] in there it was just hidden
[1:05:13] couldn't add anything to it couldn't be
[1:05:16] a new revelation it had to be the
[1:05:18] unspoken part and that's what the
[1:05:20] revealing of the Seven Seals revealed
[1:05:22] that's what it was all about
[1:05:24] so it's all revealed in there so I want
[1:05:27] to read this again what this man said he
[1:05:29] says well them them seven Thunders
[1:05:31] because brother Ben have been saying all
[1:05:33] along he's not even written not even
[1:05:34] written in the Bible never written
[1:05:36] anywhere
[1:05:37] them seven Thunders wouldn't them seven
[1:05:38] Thunders blasting out won't that be a
[1:05:40] revelation given to some man but if I
[1:05:42] said no sir it would be adding something
[1:05:44] to it or taking something from it it's
[1:05:46] all revealed in there and the Seven
[1:05:49] Seals opened up the revelation of what
[1:05:51] that was
[1:05:53] that's what it was see it's still in the
[1:05:56] word you see you can't get out of that
[1:05:58] word it won't leave the word and God's
[1:06:00] spirit will never leave that word it'll
[1:06:02] stay right with the word blinding some
[1:06:05] and opening the eyes of others
[1:06:09] it'll always do that
[1:06:12] blinding some and opening the eyes of
[1:06:16] others
[1:06:17] aren't you glad you live in the day it
[1:06:18] opened your eyes
[1:06:20] because if it wasn't for the
[1:06:22] predestination of God and the grace of
[1:06:24] God it would blinded you
[1:06:25] you can't see because you wanted to see
[1:06:28] you can't see because you tried to see
[1:06:31] you can only see because you you've been
[1:06:34] predestinated to be a child of the light
[1:06:36] is the only reason you can see
[1:06:39] and so if you can see there's no Pride
[1:06:41] that comes with being able to see
[1:06:42] there's only a heart of gratitude for
[1:06:44] what God has done for us there's a
[1:06:46] Thanksgiving that Wells up in us because
[1:06:48] I know I'm helpless to see unless God
[1:06:50] made me see
[1:06:53] I would be like everybody else running
[1:06:55] back into the shadows of laodicea so
[1:06:57] that I could stay in a familiar place
[1:06:59] where I can see and understand but it's
[1:07:01] the god predestinated me for another
[1:07:03] purpose and when I come into the light
[1:07:05] out of the darkness I'll admit to you
[1:07:07] when I first walked into it I had to
[1:07:09] Blink hard a few times and it took me a
[1:07:11] little while to get oriented amen it was
[1:07:13] so bright and so much and so so much
[1:07:16] information and so overwhelming it took
[1:07:18] me just a little while I splinted for a
[1:07:20] while and I blinked for a little while
[1:07:22] but once I got accustomed to what I was
[1:07:24] predestinated for I looked around and I
[1:07:26] could see the colors and I could see the
[1:07:28] vibrancy and I'm still discovering what
[1:07:31] God has revealed in the turning on of
[1:07:33] the line
[1:07:34] we're still exploring our Bible under
[1:07:36] the light amen
[1:07:39] praise God
[1:07:42] now let's go to John chapter three I
[1:07:45] want to just maybe jump tracks a little
[1:07:47] bit but it's not really off my subject
[1:07:49] but hang with me
[1:07:52] I want to take a look at John chapter
[1:07:54] three
[1:08:01] now I want to look at
[1:08:03] some things brother Branham says because
[1:08:04] he so clearly declares what the seven
[1:08:06] Thunders are
[1:08:08] he so clearly ties the seven Thunders
[1:08:11] with the seventh seal with the
[1:08:13] Revelation contained in the seals with
[1:08:15] the coming of the Lord he so clearly
[1:08:17] ties it together
[1:08:19] but then he always makes so many
[1:08:21] comments like we're waiting for the
[1:08:22] coming of the Lord and and it's not
[1:08:24] revealed it's not to be made known to
[1:08:26] the public but it'll be made known in
[1:08:28] the hour that's so we have all of these
[1:08:30] statements
[1:08:31] and I want to I want to look at these
[1:08:33] statements for a minute
[1:08:35] in John chapter 3 verse 22.
[1:08:41] John chapter 3 verse 22 after these
[1:08:44] things came Jesus and his disciples into
[1:08:47] the land of Judea and there he teared
[1:08:49] with them and baptized and John also was
[1:08:52] baptizing in Enon near to Salem because
[1:08:55] because there was much water there and
[1:08:58] they came and were baptized for John was
[1:09:01] not yet cast into prison I don't want to
[1:09:03] look at this for just a second
[1:09:05] there was a period of time after the
[1:09:08] Forerunner declared the the Lamb of God
[1:09:12] Behold the Lamb of God who take away the
[1:09:14] sin of the world he saw uh the the
[1:09:16] spirit of God to sin like a dove and
[1:09:18] rest upon him he saw it and he declared
[1:09:20] who the spirit told me this is the one
[1:09:23] and Behold the Lamb of God to taketh
[1:09:25] away the sin of the world the Forerunner
[1:09:27] had declared what he had come to forerun
[1:09:30] and he says he's here and he's them
[1:09:33] but he didn't stop his ministry he kept
[1:09:35] on baptizing unto repentance
[1:09:39] he continued on he was not yet in prison
[1:09:42] he didn't close up shop and then go
[1:09:44] follow Jesus around because there was
[1:09:46] more people he had to point towards
[1:09:48] Jesus and he was still doing the work of
[1:09:50] a forerunner of Malachi 3 preparing the
[1:09:53] way and Malachi the first part of
[1:09:55] Malachi 4 turning the hearts of the the
[1:09:57] fathers to the children
[1:10:00] and so he didn't he didn't change his
[1:10:03] ministry after he declared Behold the
[1:10:06] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:10:07] the world after he recognized the coming
[1:10:09] of the Lord he continued on in the same
[1:10:12] Ministry
[1:10:15] okay
[1:10:16] everything in the Bible runs parallel
[1:10:22] for 20 verse 24 for John was not yet
[1:10:24] cast into prison then there arose
[1:10:26] questions between some of John's
[1:10:27] disciples and the Jews about purifying
[1:10:30] and they came unto John and said unto
[1:10:32] him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond
[1:10:35] Jordan to whom thou bearest witness
[1:10:37] behold he the same baptizes and all men
[1:10:40] come to him
[1:10:42] like John's going to be angry
[1:10:44] that they're going to Jesus
[1:10:46] but yet he's still baptizing and some
[1:10:48] are still coming to him
[1:10:50] does that make sense
[1:10:53] John answerner said a man can receive
[1:10:55] nothing except to be given him from
[1:10:57] heaven
[1:10:58] so what's he saying
[1:11:00] don't receive it in the hour they're
[1:11:02] supposed to receive it
[1:11:06] ye sells bear me witness that I said I
[1:11:09] am not the Christ but that I am sent
[1:11:11] before him
[1:11:12] he that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[1:11:14] but the friend of the bridegroom would
[1:11:15] standeth and heareth him rejoices
[1:11:17] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:11:19] voice thus my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:11:22] he must increase but I must decrease
[1:11:26] so we see that in in John the Baptist
[1:11:30] the first Forerunner when he came amen
[1:11:33] he he didn't close up shops Stop his
[1:11:36] ministry and go shut down but he kept
[1:11:39] calling people into repentance preparing
[1:11:41] the way for the Lord amen and I just
[1:11:44] wanted this is just me this is just
[1:11:45] surmising I don't have any way of
[1:11:47] knowing but how many people did he
[1:11:49] baptize after he declared Behold the
[1:11:52] Lamb of God Amen that would later come
[1:11:55] to the revelation of Christ under
[1:11:57] Peter's Ministry
[1:12:00] yes why because the the it'll be
[1:12:04] revealed in the hour it's supposed to be
[1:12:06] revealed
[1:12:07] he was there still fulfilling Malachi 3
[1:12:09] in the first part of Malachi 4.
[1:12:12] all right now brother Branham says in
[1:12:15] the message the unveiling of God
[1:12:18] in 1964 he says he did it in the
[1:12:20] reformers taken on a veil taken on a
[1:12:23] veil until finally it come down through
[1:12:25] the Luther age down through the other
[1:12:26] age then finally it comes out into the
[1:12:29] complete
[1:12:30] was that the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:32] in Bride form it comes through the
[1:12:35] complete just before it comes a prophet
[1:12:37] arises again what it does is foreshadows
[1:12:40] the word showing back here revealing
[1:12:42] what's been done what's been left off
[1:12:44] that the church will be not without
[1:12:46] understanding then when this Fades out
[1:12:49] then like John said I must decreased he
[1:12:52] must increase so brother Brown is
[1:12:54] following in the same exact pattern
[1:12:57] then all in all comes into him he is
[1:13:00] fully manifested through Luther Wesley
[1:13:02] Pentecostal agent on down and on down he
[1:13:05] is fully manifested you see come down
[1:13:06] just a manifestation
[1:13:08] God unfolding see him uh fulfilled in
[1:13:13] his promises for this day as they had so
[1:13:16] Jesus said as that comes then it must be
[1:13:19] I must decrease he must increase it must
[1:13:21] decrease he must increase and and
[1:13:23] brother Branham had come to this point
[1:13:25] where he declared amen what God had done
[1:13:28] he had he had preached the seven
[1:13:30] Thunders the revelation of the Seven
[1:13:32] Seals showing that the lamb had taken
[1:13:34] the book and the mighty angel had come
[1:13:36] down
[1:13:37] but he continued to go to Pentecostals
[1:13:41] he continued to go out to those who
[1:13:43] hadn't yet received it and he continued
[1:13:45] to do the work that God had him to do
[1:13:47] and he continued to talk to them in the
[1:13:49] language that they would understand and
[1:13:51] he continued to tell them now we know
[1:13:53] we're looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:13:54] and all of these things brother
[1:13:55] Brandon's not denying everything else he
[1:13:57] said but he's continuing on in his
[1:14:00] ministry to the Pentecostal age
[1:14:03] because it'll be revealed in the hour
[1:14:06] it's supposed to be revealed and it's
[1:14:08] not given to all men to know but it's
[1:14:10] given unto some
[1:14:12] so he's continually showing them that
[1:14:15] we're looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:14:16] and he's continually doing the work of
[1:14:18] Forerunner and he's continually showing
[1:14:20] the first and second and third pull all
[1:14:22] the way through to the end of his
[1:14:24] ministry and he's continuing to grab
[1:14:26] people all the way through the end of
[1:14:28] his ministry and Beyond
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:34] I know for me it took the first and
[1:14:38] second pull to get my attention
[1:14:41] so that Ministry was still working for
[1:14:43] me
[1:14:44] in 1999 the first and second poll was
[1:14:47] still at work
[1:14:49] I I saw amen the manifestation I saw God
[1:14:53] and the man I saw Christ amen I saw the
[1:14:56] discernment I saw the gift of Prophecy
[1:14:58] it got my attention and then I got
[1:15:00] hooked on the third pull by the opening
[1:15:02] of the word so the the ministry is still
[1:15:05] working today
[1:15:07] it still continues on it doesn't mean
[1:15:10] that the Lord didn't come in 1963 but
[1:15:13] I'll tell you he cometh
[1:15:15] he's coming amen he cometh go out to
[1:15:18] join him he cometh go out to him
[1:15:21] you he's still coming and you can still
[1:15:23] go out to him
[1:15:25] he's still coming to individuals and you
[1:15:27] can still go out to him they're still an
[1:15:29] individual that's that's hearing the
[1:15:31] first pull they're still an individual
[1:15:33] somewhere that's getting attracted by
[1:15:35] the second Bull there's still a fish
[1:15:37] that's getting close to that hook and
[1:15:38] getting ready to bite the third pull the
[1:15:40] ministry is still continuing on and
[1:15:43] it'll be revealed in the hour it's
[1:15:44] supposed to be revealed
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:47] amen it's not a cut off
[1:15:51] if it was a cut off I was cut out
[1:15:54] but it's an event it's a transition it's
[1:15:57] a change in dispensation and now we're
[1:15:59] entering into the new dispensation
[1:16:02] and now we go out to meet him
[1:16:05] brother M says in questions and answers
[1:16:07] on the seals is the last day he's
[1:16:09] preaching the seals this evening he'll
[1:16:10] preach the seventh seal and now in the
[1:16:12] morning he's doing questions and answers
[1:16:13] on the seals and this is what he says
[1:16:16] is and then also know that right among
[1:16:18] you things are happening
[1:16:20] then I'm just I I know I know that you
[1:16:24] don't see it
[1:16:27] I'm just positive that you don't see it
[1:16:31] what was happening the revelation of the
[1:16:33] Thunders were taking place day by day
[1:16:36] and they weren't catching it I'm
[1:16:38] positive that you don't see it
[1:16:41] and you say brother Brandon that's a
[1:16:42] hard thing for you to say that I know it
[1:16:44] is but look let me just say this now I
[1:16:47] suppose this is just on tapes for
[1:16:48] ourselves and so forth but let me say
[1:16:50] this you don't you don't get it and
[1:16:53] you're not supposed to get it
[1:16:57] so don't try to interpret anything see
[1:16:59] don't try to put your interpretation to
[1:17:02] it you only get further away just take
[1:17:05] my advice if you believe me now if God
[1:17:08] has given me favor in your sight you
[1:17:10] know that them Revelations and things
[1:17:12] I've been here with you a long time and
[1:17:15] it's always been right and now to double
[1:17:17] prove it right it hooks right in with
[1:17:19] the word see so you know it's thus saith
[1:17:21] the Lord that's exactly it's proved to
[1:17:23] you now take my advice as your brother
[1:17:25] don't put your own interpretation to
[1:17:27] anything you just go on and live a good
[1:17:30] Christian life because you'll only wind
[1:17:32] yourself away from the real thing when
[1:17:33] you do it you only wind your way again
[1:17:35] away from the thing and all of you are
[1:17:38] conscious and know that there's
[1:17:39] something mysterious happening and it's
[1:17:42] happening and I know what it is
[1:17:45] now I'm not saying that it's the grace
[1:17:47] of God that lets me know what what that
[1:17:49] is is something that's tremendous and
[1:17:51] it's gone right now and there's not a
[1:17:54] way in the world for you to see it
[1:17:56] but so help me with this Bible in my
[1:17:58] hand I know what it is
[1:18:01] it's been told you before
[1:18:04] when was it told to them and serves is
[1:18:07] this the time and the preach
[1:18:09] and serves us at the time and the brick
[1:18:11] he told them what it was going to be
[1:18:13] then he comes to the to the revelation
[1:18:15] of it and then he says are you getting
[1:18:16] it do you see it something's happening
[1:18:18] all around you I know you're not getting
[1:18:20] it you're not supposed to get it
[1:18:22] don't even try to get it just live for
[1:18:26] Christ
[1:18:27] amen
[1:18:28] because it'll be revealed in the hour
[1:18:30] it's supposed to be revealed
[1:18:34] it's been told you before so just don't
[1:18:36] try to put any interpretation but just
[1:18:38] believe me as your brother we're living
[1:18:40] in a great hour we're living in a time
[1:18:43] where where well you just be real humble
[1:18:46] be a Christian and try to live for God
[1:18:47] and live honest with your fellow man and
[1:18:49] love those who don't love you don't try
[1:18:52] to make any you see you do you only make
[1:18:54] it a mysterious something and mess the
[1:18:56] real program of God up
[1:18:58] yesterday afternoon something happened
[1:19:00] in my room that I'll never be able to
[1:19:03] leave it this is when he was coming to
[1:19:05] The Sixth Seal
[1:19:07] I'll never be able to leave it you see
[1:19:08] and about two weeks ago something
[1:19:10] happened that I'll never be able to as
[1:19:11] long as I live on this Earth and that's
[1:19:13] when he got caught up into the
[1:19:14] constellation of angels and he ties
[1:19:16] those two things together
[1:19:19] he says that that I'll never be able to
[1:19:21] as long as I live on this Earth I'll
[1:19:23] never be able to get away from it see
[1:19:25] and so but now I want you to catch what
[1:19:28] he says
[1:19:29] but if the church
[1:19:31] you're not supposed to know these things
[1:19:35] so don't put no interpretation to
[1:19:37] anything see you just go ahead and just
[1:19:40] remember what you're told live a
[1:19:42] Christian Life
[1:19:46] he says
[1:19:48] the church you're not supposed to know
[1:19:50] these things
[1:19:52] why because this is not a revelation
[1:19:56] that's for the church
[1:19:58] this is a revelation that's for an
[1:20:00] individual bride
[1:20:04] one by one it is not a group
[1:20:07] dispensation he's not preaching the
[1:20:10] seven seal series and imparting the
[1:20:12] Revelation upon everybody in the room he
[1:20:14] said don't even try don't interpret
[1:20:16] nothing you just live humble if God
[1:20:18] wants you to know anything he'll reveal
[1:20:19] it to you this is not a church
[1:20:21] Revelation this is a revelation to the
[1:20:23] bride as individuals who will receive it
[1:20:26] individually one at a time when God
[1:20:28] ordains
[1:20:30] this is not something that's taught this
[1:20:32] is not something that's imparted amen
[1:20:35] this is something that's open and God's
[1:20:37] timing in the hour that it's meant to be
[1:20:39] revealed it'll be revealed
[1:20:41] you can walk a long time close to the
[1:20:44] truth and still not see it you can hear
[1:20:45] it preached multiple times but when God
[1:20:48] is ready to open the key of Revelation
[1:20:50] to you and he opens the door and all of
[1:20:52] a sudden Aha and all the dominoes fall
[1:20:55] and everything falls in the place that
[1:20:57] wasn't you that wasn't the gift of a
[1:20:59] Preacher amen that was God that was
[1:21:01] God's time for you to see it don't try
[1:21:04] to put any interpretation to it don't
[1:21:06] try to figure it out you just live a
[1:21:08] simple Christian Life and when God's
[1:21:10] time comes he'll reveal it to you
[1:21:14] the church isn't supposed to get it
[1:21:17] the bride is
[1:21:20] the group isn't supposed to catch it in
[1:21:23] one series of sermons
[1:21:25] the individual members of his body are
[1:21:28] supposed to catch it individually
[1:21:30] remember the third pull is tied in with
[1:21:33] the seventh seal is tied in with the
[1:21:35] revelation of the seven Thunders and
[1:21:37] remember the vision of the third pool
[1:21:39] amen when he was supposed to be fishing
[1:21:41] to catch the rainbow trout amen and he
[1:21:43] got caught up amen he was looking over
[1:21:45] this Cathedral and there was a on the
[1:21:47] platform a little box and they were
[1:21:49] going in one by one
[1:21:52] right and the pillar of fire went down
[1:21:55] he saw go into the box people were
[1:21:57] coming one by one they were coming in in
[1:22:00] firm they were coming out healed they
[1:22:01] were coming in Afflicted they were going
[1:22:03] out whole amen so that it was an
[1:22:05] individual person going into a private
[1:22:08] place to meet the pillar of Fire
[1:22:12] right
[1:22:13] and the angel said
[1:22:16] he says I'll meet you in there it won't
[1:22:19] be a public show
[1:22:23] this is not broke to the public this is
[1:22:27] broke to the bride
[1:22:29] individually amen it's not a public show
[1:22:32] and he says this will be your third pull
[1:22:38] so this is not a church Revelation this
[1:22:41] is not a Doctrine to be taught this is
[1:22:44] an event to take place in your life
[1:22:49] amen
[1:22:51] and the message the Feast of the
[1:22:53] trumpets
[1:22:54] President says now this is the complete
[1:22:56] revelation of Jesus Christ he passed his
[1:22:59] Bible he said in the Seven Seals had the
[1:23:01] mystery hid of what it it was all about
[1:23:04] and it's supposed to open in the last
[1:23:06] day at the laodicean age at the end of
[1:23:08] time
[1:23:09] thanks be to God that finishes the
[1:23:12] message through the church that finishes
[1:23:15] it when they look back and see what was
[1:23:17] been and see where it's all been brought
[1:23:19] up to that finishes it the age of the
[1:23:22] church
[1:23:23] so the opening of the seals finished the
[1:23:25] age of the church it's sealed it's done
[1:23:27] now it opens the bright age
[1:23:30] and this Revelation is to the individual
[1:23:35] let's go to Isaiah 60.
[1:23:49] Isaiah 60 and verse 1.
[1:23:55] arise Shine for thy lightest come
[1:23:59] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:24:01] thee
[1:24:02] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:24:04] Earth and gross Darkness to people but
[1:24:07] the Lord shall arise upon thee in his
[1:24:09] glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:24:13] the the
[1:24:16] seven Thunders produced the evening
[1:24:19] lights
[1:24:20] Shalom good morning little bride
[1:24:24] it's a good morning to you as an
[1:24:26] individual when the light rises in your
[1:24:29] life
[1:24:31] it's it's shalom it's good morning it's
[1:24:34] peace it's new day it's all of this when
[1:24:38] the light arises in your individual
[1:24:40] hearts
[1:24:43] he says in the message it is the rising
[1:24:45] of the Sun
[1:24:46] said not long ago I was told a little
[1:24:48] story about a fisherman a fellow come
[1:24:50] out and hired an old fisherman to take
[1:24:53] him fishing out on the west coast they
[1:24:55] went out that morning
[1:24:57] if any of you had fish out there for the
[1:24:59] salmon why you know what takes place it
[1:25:01] gets awfully foggy out there I see my
[1:25:03] little brother Eddie bisco down here a
[1:25:05] missionary to the Indians out there and
[1:25:07] we fished ourselves out on those coasts
[1:25:09] so this fisherman was kind of a green
[1:25:11] horn you know and he went fishing and
[1:25:13] they drifted out waiting for daylight to
[1:25:15] come you know and and they couldn't hear
[1:25:18] the Foghorn no more and this fisherman
[1:25:20] got all excited and said say we're
[1:25:22] drifting out to sea hey get got all
[1:25:24] excited
[1:25:25] he said sit down son sit down the old
[1:25:27] fisherman quiet you know he knowed what
[1:25:30] he was talking about said just wait
[1:25:32] until the sun comes up then we can see
[1:25:34] where we're at
[1:25:36] you say must I be Methodist Baptist
[1:25:37] Pentecostal just wait the sun comes up
[1:25:40] we'll see where we're at he is the word
[1:25:43] wait till you see the word manifested
[1:25:45] shining across the seed the wave sheep
[1:25:47] will see where we're at
[1:25:52] amen don't get excited don't run to and
[1:25:54] fro don't try to figure anything out
[1:25:55] just wait till the sun rises in your
[1:25:58] heart and all of a sudden the Revelation
[1:26:00] clicks which is all up to God not up to
[1:26:04] us amen we can consecrate ourselves to
[1:26:06] it we can pray we can read amen but it
[1:26:08] takes God to turn on the light but I
[1:26:11] want to tell you there's a man here that
[1:26:12] can turn on the light amen there is a
[1:26:15] man present and that man is Christ Jesus
[1:26:17] and there's a man here that can turn on
[1:26:19] the light and when he turns on the light
[1:26:21] if you're a Child of the Light then
[1:26:23] you'll see what you've not been able to
[1:26:25] see before
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:29] so the question is is the seventh seal
[1:26:31] open yes
[1:26:33] is the seventh seal revealed yes does
[1:26:37] the seventh seal still need to be
[1:26:38] revealed yes
[1:26:41] but it'll be revealed in the hour it's
[1:26:43] supposed to be revealed
[1:26:45] but I'm not waiting for that hour
[1:26:48] somebody else maybe
[1:26:50] for me he's turned on the light
[1:26:53] for me I've seen this coming I've
[1:26:55] recognized my day and its message to me
[1:26:58] it's shalom to me it's good morning to
[1:27:01] me it's the rising of the sun to me I
[1:27:04] was lost at sea and denominationalism
[1:27:06] but the sun came up Drew away the fog
[1:27:08] and now I know where I'm at
[1:27:11] amen that doesn't mean it's open to
[1:27:13] every seed amen it still needs to be
[1:27:15] open the ministry of the three pools
[1:27:18] still needs to go forth amen that
[1:27:20] Ministry of Malachi 4 still needs to be
[1:27:22] out upon the Earth but hey for me the
[1:27:25] Sun is up amen for me the Revelation has
[1:27:28] struck home
[1:27:30] and I pray for every seed of God that's
[1:27:33] out there
[1:27:34] that in The Hour That is supposed to be
[1:27:37] revealed
[1:27:39] it'll be revealed
[1:27:41] We've Got Confidence he won't lose one
[1:27:45] man no it's it's it's not complicated it
[1:27:50] it's full of details why why do you say
[1:27:54] that brother Chad because it's the
[1:27:55] opening of the whole Bible
[1:27:58] it's the whole plan and mystery of God
[1:28:00] he's held in his heart since the
[1:28:02] foundation of the world do you think
[1:28:03] that's simplistic like that can be
[1:28:05] explained in 30 seconds this is the
[1:28:07] whole entire heart's desire and thought
[1:28:09] of God there's lots of details but the
[1:28:12] revelation of it is simple
[1:28:14] in the appointed time he turned on the
[1:28:17] light
[1:28:18] he he come and revealed the hidden
[1:28:20] Mystery that nobody was able to discern
[1:28:23] why wasn't it written in the Bible why
[1:28:25] is revelation 8 1 the seventh seal
[1:28:27] written the way it's written and why is
[1:28:28] revelation 10 1-7 written the way it's
[1:28:30] written it's written so nobody can
[1:28:32] tamper with it nothing is written there
[1:28:34] it would take a prophet who God can come
[1:28:37] down himself and show that the lamb is
[1:28:39] the only one who can open this so that
[1:28:42] he would get to his children there's
[1:28:43] only one person that can do this and
[1:28:45] it's not William Branham
[1:28:48] there's only one person who can do this
[1:28:50] and that's the mighty Angel who comes
[1:28:52] down with an open book in Islam
[1:28:55] so that that bride would say wait a
[1:28:58] minute
[1:29:00] wait a minute according to the Bible he
[1:29:04] has to be here amen according to the
[1:29:06] Bible the lamb has to take the book
[1:29:08] according to the Bible he's present and
[1:29:11] I must go out and Unite with him and
[1:29:13] he'll take me into the marriage
[1:29:15] something
[1:29:17] now is the wedding time
[1:29:19] for those who can come
[1:29:22] those who've recognized the seventh seal
[1:29:24] it's your wedding day
[1:29:27] some of you been married for a while
[1:29:29] something you've been married recently
[1:29:31] some of you are yet to be married
[1:29:33] but in the hour it's supposed to be
[1:29:35] revealed
[1:29:37] it'll be revealed
[1:29:39] God bless you let's all stand
[1:29:42] I just thank God for the revelation of
[1:29:44] his word
[1:29:47] for me
[1:29:49] as the Bible keeps opening and opening
[1:29:52] the message keeps opening it gets
[1:29:54] simpler and simpler and simpler
[1:29:58] that it's him coming to an individual
[1:30:03] to unite and become one
[1:30:05] so that is now Christ
[1:30:07] with preeminence in your flesh that's
[1:30:10] what he wants to accomplish in this hour
[1:30:13] and not just in one person but in the
[1:30:16] entire body around the world but it'll
[1:30:19] come one by one in our appointed season
[1:30:23] and musicians if you could come and
[1:30:25] brother John if you'll make your way up
[1:30:27] this is bow our head and thank the Lord
[1:30:30] dear heavenly father I thank you Lord
[1:30:33] Jesus
[1:30:34] for your word is so precious to us Lord
[1:30:38] God there's no way we can express our
[1:30:40] gratitude and words for what you've
[1:30:42] given to us
[1:30:43] and Lord with all of our heart Lord we
[1:30:46] we want to share what you shared with us
[1:30:48] but
[1:30:49] it seems so impossible to take what's in
[1:30:51] our heart and take it out and put it in
[1:30:54] somebody else's heart
[1:30:56] so I'm asking God that you would come
[1:30:58] and turn on the lights
[1:31:00] I pray God that you would come and break
[1:31:03] the seals of individual hearts and lives
[1:31:05] that you would unlock the mystery of
[1:31:07] lives Lord
[1:31:09] that they would see the light that they
[1:31:11] would hear the bridegroom call and that
[1:31:13] they would leave everything and come and
[1:31:15] Unite with you enter into the marriage
[1:31:18] Union and walk with you all the way to
[1:31:20] the marriage supper
[1:31:21] for God we're in a transition time
[1:31:23] transitioning out of this world
[1:31:25] transitioning out of the natural into
[1:31:27] the supernatural we're leaving Lord
[1:31:29] we're in a journey we're in the Rapture
[1:31:31] we're moving Lord we're not stationary
[1:31:34] we're not waiting we're in progress
[1:31:37] help us to keep walking with you keep
[1:31:40] growing in this light keep learning of
[1:31:42] you and becoming more like you and may
[1:31:44] we continually give you more preeminence
[1:31:46] Lord and may this Revelation change us
[1:31:49] day by day
[1:31:51] God we want to give you first place and
[1:31:53] everything in every way we pray God that
[1:31:55] the preaching of the word would be
[1:31:57] effective in the hearts and lives of
[1:31:59] your children may you use it Lord to
[1:32:01] stimulate Revelation may you use it to
[1:32:04] open doors of understanding and may the
[1:32:07] eyes come open me the preaching of the
[1:32:09] word bring isab to your children
[1:32:12] give us greater Vision Lord greater
[1:32:15] understanding oh how we love you father
[1:32:17] we ask that you would have preeminence
[1:32:19] Among Us be glorified in US

[1:32:24] this hour finish it through these
[1:32:26] vessels of clay
