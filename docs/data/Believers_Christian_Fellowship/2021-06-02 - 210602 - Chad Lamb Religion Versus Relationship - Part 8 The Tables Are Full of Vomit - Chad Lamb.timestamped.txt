[5:16] god is good to us is he not amen
[5:20] now that i can see your face is no
[5:22] yawning
[5:25] no smirking no grimace just smile please
[5:30] amen we counted a privilege to be
[5:32] together
[5:33] today it's been a strange year a lot of
[5:35] things have changed one way than the
[5:37] other but
[5:38] but god's kept us through it all amen
[5:41] when we compare notes with those
[5:43] our brothers and sisters around the
[5:44] world we've had it really easy
[5:46] friends we've been blessed god's made it
[5:48] to where we can be together we can
[5:50] fellowship together and
[5:52] whatever inconveniences they had they
[5:53] were very minor but i tell you they were
[5:55] good for my character
[5:58] and i thank god for that i thank god
[6:00] that he's brought us through he's
[6:01] bringing us through
[6:03] no doubt there's many more things we'll
[6:04] face more trials more obstacles more
[6:06] difficulties
[6:08] more tough decisions more more and more
[6:11] and more
[6:11] but he's the one who'll bring us through
[6:13] them all right
[6:15] and he's doing it for our good because
[6:17] he wants to reflect himself
[6:19] in us so we thank god for that
[6:22] while we're standing let's take our
[6:23] bibles and turn to isaiah 28.
[6:26] i'd like to continue on with religion
[6:29] versus relationship
[6:30] this would be part 8.
[6:34] and we'll take this scripture out of
[6:36] isaiah
[6:37] chapter 28.
[6:42] in isaiah 28 and we'll read just one
[6:45] verse
[6:46] we'll read verse eight for all tables
[6:49] are full of vomit
[6:50] and filthiness so that there is no place
[6:54] clean so i'd like to take that for our
[6:57] text tonight for
[6:58] the title the tables are full of vomit
[7:01] it sounds rough but i pray
[7:03] you'll understand as we expound on that
[7:05] as we get into it let's bow our heads
[7:07] and just ask the lord's blessing
[7:09] lord jesus we thank you for the
[7:10] privilege again father of gathering like
[7:12] this
[7:13] for it's your grace that's brought us
[7:15] here lord you've sustained us and kept
[7:17] us and
[7:18] gathered us together again and oh god
[7:20] how we thank you for your goodness to us
[7:23] and lord i pray that you would come and
[7:25] make yourself known by the breaking of
[7:27] bread
[7:28] god may you feed your sheep and may we
[7:30] be the sheep of your pasture that feeds
[7:33] from your hand
[7:34] and god may we grow by this food that
[7:36] you give us
[7:37] give us the eye salve that we might see
[7:39] more clearly in the day that we're
[7:41] living
[7:41] may we follow after you and be pleasing
[7:43] to you and all we say or do
[7:45] lord have preeminence among us and keep
[7:48] us along the way in jesus christ's name
[7:50] we pray
[7:51] amen you can all be seated
[7:55] we're not going to really expound on
[7:57] this verse right now brother branham
[7:58] does later we'll get to some quotes
[7:59] where he refers to this quote
[8:01] for the tables are full of vomit and
[8:03] filthiness so there is no
[8:05] no place clean i'd like to go over to
[8:07] first corinthians together
[8:10] if you can i've got several places in
[8:12] the scripture i'd like to read from
[8:14] this evening as the lord leads but let's
[8:17] start with
[8:18] first corinthians
[8:21] chapter 5.
[8:31] this is yeah first corinthians chapter 5
[8:35] verse 8
[8:37] therefore let us keep the feasts not
[8:39] with old leaven
[8:41] neither with the leaven of malice and
[8:42] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[8:45] of sincerity
[8:47] and truth so paul's admonishing us with
[8:50] to keep this feast amen not in the old
[8:52] form and
[8:53] and in the old form they were to take
[8:55] the leaven the literal physical leaven
[8:56] and purge it out of their dwelling place
[8:58] but now he's telling us to keep this
[9:00] feast within ourselves
[9:02] not with the old leaven neither with the
[9:04] leaven of malice and wickedness
[9:06] but with the unleavened bread of
[9:08] sincerity
[9:09] and truth amen that's how god desires to
[9:12] be worshiped
[9:14] let's let's turn over to the book of
[9:15] revelation together revelation 18.
[9:18] we're going to grab two verses out of
[9:20] revelation
[9:22] first revelation 18
[9:26] and verse 4.
[9:30] and i heard another voice from heaven
[9:32] saying come out of her my people
[9:34] that ye be not partakers of her sins and
[9:36] that you receive not of her plagues
[9:39] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[9:41] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[9:44] reward her even if she rewarded you and
[9:46] double unto her according
[9:48] to her works and the cup which she has
[9:50] filled
[9:51] filled to her double how much she had
[9:54] glorified herself
[9:55] and lived deliciously so much torment
[9:57] and sorrow give her for she saith in her
[10:00] heart
[10:00] i said a queen and am no widow and shall
[10:03] see no sorrow
[10:05] therefore shall our plagues come in one
[10:06] day death and mourning and famine
[10:09] and she shall be utterly burned with
[10:10] fire for strong is the lord god
[10:13] who judgeth her we know that in the
[10:16] scripture god is
[10:17] passing a judgment on the great
[10:20] the the
[10:20] issue is she doesn't know that she's a
[10:24] she thinks she's a queen she thinks she
[10:27] is no widow
[10:28] she's a married woman she is no widow
[10:30] and she sees no sorrow
[10:32] she believes that she is the bride of
[10:34] christ that she's married to jesus
[10:35] christ
[10:36] and that she's not a widow and that she
[10:38] will see no sorrow
[10:40] she believes that everything is okay but
[10:43] god is trying to show her her real
[10:44] condition and her real condition
[10:47] is as a full of abomination and
[10:49] full of filthiness
[10:52] and so there's nothing clean in her at
[10:54] all there is no clean place in her
[10:57] at all but she doesn't know that for she
[10:59] believes she's the queen of heaven
[11:01] let's turn over to revelation chapter 3.
[11:12] in verse 14. this is speaking to the
[11:15] same church this
[11:16] this is called out in this church age
[11:19] what we just read
[11:20] in the laodicean church agent we're
[11:22] going to read here out of
[11:23] chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel
[11:25] the church of the laodiceans write these
[11:27] things saith thee amen
[11:29] the faithful and true witness the
[11:31] beginning of the creation of god
[11:33] i know thy works that thou art neither
[11:35] cold nor hot i would that were cold
[11:37] or hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[11:40] and neither cold nor hot
[11:41] i will spew thee out of my mouth and
[11:43] brother branham says
[11:45] it makes him sick this church's
[11:47] condition makes him sick
[11:50] it makes him sick to his stomach and he
[11:52] spews it out of his mouth
[11:53] because the everything is mixed or
[11:55] neither cold nor hot
[11:56] but lukewarm and so i spew you out of my
[11:59] mouth because thou sayest
[12:01] i am rich and increase with goods and
[12:03] have need of nothing
[12:04] and know us not thou are wretched and
[12:06] miserable and poor
[12:08] and blind and naked this is the same
[12:12] situation that we found the church in
[12:14] the great horror in revelations
[12:16] 18 we found the same situation here she
[12:19] says i am rich
[12:20] increased with goods and have need of
[12:22] nothing
[12:24] and said now knowest not
[12:27] that thou knowest not thou are wretched
[12:30] and miserable poor and blind
[12:33] and naked i counseled thee
[12:37] to buy of me gold tried in the fire and
[12:40] the thou mayest be rich and white
[12:41] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[12:43] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[12:45] appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes
[12:47] have
[12:47] that thou may see as many as i love i
[12:50] rebuke
[12:51] and chasten be zealous therefore and
[12:53] repent
[12:55] it's the age of zealous repentance
[12:58] you can say laodicean church age is the
[13:00] age of many things but it's also the age
[13:03] of zealous
[13:04] repentance amen when god comes down and
[13:06] shows us the condition of the system
[13:08] we're in and shows us
[13:09] our condition under that system and when
[13:12] we think that we're okay
[13:13] in our mind and everything is fine in
[13:15] our manner of worship and
[13:17] in the denominational system amen god
[13:20] come in this day and he
[13:21] ripped that thing wide open amen so that
[13:23] we could see
[13:24] everything all the tables are full of
[13:27] vomit
[13:28] everything is filthy and unclean amen
[13:31] and then we ran
[13:32] with zealous repentance to get the isab
[13:34] to get the white raiment and get the
[13:36] gold trident fire
[13:38] and it was all provided for us in this
[13:39] day
[13:41] in the message all things in 1962 this
[13:44] is a message i've read and enjoyed
[13:46] brother kyle recommended it to me and
[13:48] and i i listened to it and read it and i
[13:50] enjoyed it very much
[13:52] so i recommend it to you all as well in
[13:54] 1962 the message all things he says what
[13:56] a tragedy
[13:57] it is to see the church in this
[13:59] condition
[14:01] not that i have anything against
[14:02] churches but you see what i mean
[14:04] now no sorrow just a ritualistic form
[14:07] and yet israel was using the word and
[14:09] commandment of god
[14:11] and the churches today take the things
[14:13] out of the bible
[14:14] but there's no sincerity with it
[14:17] this is what i want to labor on for a
[14:19] while there's no sincerity with it
[14:21] amen and and paul was admonishing them
[14:24] to to eat this feast not of the old
[14:26] leaven or the leaven of malice
[14:28] and wickedness but of the unleavened
[14:30] bread of sincerity and truth amen
[14:33] that's the purity by which god wants us
[14:35] not just truth but sincerity and truth
[14:37] not just sincerity with no truth
[14:41] amen there's a lot of sincere worshipers
[14:43] are out there and brother ben said
[14:44] they're truly sincere they're just
[14:45] sincerely wrong
[14:46] because they have no truth amen but
[14:48] there's also those that have truth with
[14:50] no sincerity
[14:51] and it's just as bad but we must eat
[14:55] this feast with the unleavened bread of
[14:56] sincerity
[14:57] and truth the church is today taking
[15:01] things out of the bible but there's no
[15:02] sincerity with it
[15:04] and when israel began to take the word
[15:05] and commandments of god and make it a
[15:07] ritual
[15:08] that displeased jehovah the giver of it
[15:11] it was about that time when they made
[15:13] made god's word a ritual
[15:15] that the mighty prophet isaiah appeared
[15:17] on the scene read it isaiah 1
[15:19] he was sent to israel they hated him and
[15:21] finally sought him to pieces
[15:23] but what did he do he stripped them he
[15:25] said your solemn feast god has refused
[15:27] he said it's become a stink in his
[15:29] nostrils
[15:30] what was it the feast that god ordained
[15:32] for them
[15:33] the new moons and the sabbath and the
[15:35] offerings of sin offerings and so forth
[15:37] that god had given to israel they had
[15:39] made a tradition out of it
[15:40] that's right that god
[15:44] gave them the order god gave them the
[15:46] structure
[15:47] amen but when they took it as a
[15:49] tradition and no longer had sincerity
[15:51] behind it
[15:52] god no longer wanted it god no longer
[15:55] liked it and it was never bringing it
[15:56] was not bringing him pleasure
[15:58] anymore and they were going through the
[16:00] form and thinking everything was okay
[16:02] because this is what moses said this is
[16:05] the form that
[16:05] moses gave us were doing what the bible
[16:08] said but they were doing what the bible
[16:10] said but their heart was not attached to
[16:12] what they were doing
[16:14] their heart was far away they were just
[16:16] going through the motions and it became
[16:18] a tradition to them with no more feeling
[16:20] with no more sincerity
[16:22] and god began to refuse the very worship
[16:25] that he ordained
[16:27] god began to refuse the very system that
[16:30] he set up
[16:33] let's turn to isaiah and read this
[16:36] we can turn together to isaiah chapter
[16:38] 1.
[16:48] in isaiah chapter 1
[16:52] we'll read from verse 11.
[16:56] isaiah chapter 1 and verse 11 to what
[16:59] purpose
[16:59] is this multitude of your sacrifices
[17:02] unto me
[17:03] oh what a question
[17:07] they could answer the question you told
[17:09] us to do this
[17:11] he's asking them the question to what
[17:13] purpose is the multitude of your
[17:15] sacrifice unto me
[17:16] saith the lord i am full of the burnt
[17:20] offerings of rams and the fatter fed
[17:21] beast and i delight not in the blood of
[17:24] bullocks
[17:25] or of lambs or of he goats when you come
[17:28] to appear before me
[17:30] who have required this at your hand to
[17:32] tread in my courts
[17:33] bring no more vain oblations
[17:37] incense is an abomination unto me who
[17:40] told him how to make the incense who
[17:41] gave him the ingredients to the incense
[17:43] and two whole who told him how to burn
[17:45] it
[17:46] it all came from him it all came from
[17:48] his instructions but now because they
[17:50] took the word of god without sincerity
[17:53] they took it without a feeling they took
[17:55] it without a heart but they made it a
[17:56] ritual
[17:57] now god was displeased and disliked the
[18:00] very thing that he
[18:01] told them how to make and he told them
[18:03] how to burn
[18:06] he says bring no more vain oblations
[18:09] incense is an abomination unto me
[18:11] the new moons and sabbaths the calling
[18:13] of assemblies i cannot away with it it
[18:16] is iniquity
[18:17] even the solemn meeting your new moons
[18:19] and your appointed feasts my soul hateth
[18:22] they are troubling to me i am weary to
[18:24] bear them
[18:25] and when you spread forth your hands i
[18:27] will hide my eyes from you
[18:29] yea when you make many prayers i will
[18:31] not hear your hands are full of blood
[18:35] they were coming according to the
[18:38] tradition
[18:39] according to the commandment and the
[18:41] commandment became a tradition
[18:43] and according to the tradition they were
[18:44] coming to make the offering that they
[18:46] were told to make
[18:47] the way they were told to make it amen
[18:49] but but they didn't have
[18:51] all the commandment correct amen because
[18:54] the commandment to come and approach
[18:56] unto god
[18:57] god gave for a way for man to approach
[19:00] unto him
[19:00] amen so that man might come into
[19:02] fellowship with god
[19:04] and now they were using what god
[19:07] intended to be for fellowship they were
[19:10] using it for a covering
[19:13] because they no longer desired the
[19:15] fellowship with god
[19:17] they wanted the fellowship with the
[19:18] world amen but they still wanted to be
[19:21] justified
[19:22] they still wanted to be okay so they
[19:24] would take what god
[19:25] gave and they were using what god gave
[19:28] for fellowship
[19:29] and to bring communion and oneness with
[19:32] him and then they were using it for
[19:34] self-justification because they really
[19:36] wanted union with the world
[19:38] but they still wanted to be okay
[19:41] thinking they're keeping the word of god
[19:43] but you can't keep the word of god
[19:44] without keeping the purpose and intent
[19:47] of the word of god
[19:49] you can keep all the law and you can
[19:51] keep all the form
[19:52] and you can keep all the structure but
[19:54] if you've gone away from the very intent
[19:56] that god gave for that law
[19:58] you can be keeping every iota of the
[20:01] commandment
[20:02] and not pleasing god because you missed
[20:04] the purpose he gave the commandment for
[20:08] because he wanted fellowship with them
[20:11] he wanted to be their god and he wanted
[20:13] them to be his people
[20:16] he wanted to lead them
[20:21] and he said he made the statement here
[20:24] in verse 14
[20:25] he said your new moons and your
[20:26] appointed feasts my soul
[20:29] hateth he's the one who gave him the new
[20:33] moons and the appointed feasts
[20:36] and now he was hating it amen because
[20:39] they were misusing his word
[20:42] misusing the commandments misusing
[20:46] the the atonements
[20:50] brother brahm goes on in all things in
[20:52] 1962 he says isaiah spilled it out to
[20:54] spilled it out to them and said god said
[20:57] that he's hiding his face from your
[20:59] prayers
[21:01] you've got your ritualistic form yet
[21:03] it's the truth
[21:04] you're doing what he told you but you're
[21:06] not doing it
[21:08] in sincerity and you squall out day and
[21:11] night but god said your sacrifice is a
[21:13] stink to me
[21:14] and i will not receive it anymore and
[21:16] when you pray under such conditions
[21:18] i'll hide my face from you oh god if
[21:21] people would think of that
[21:22] it would start a pentecost god said
[21:25] though you'd be correctly in the word
[21:27] but if you don't do it with love and
[21:29] sincerity god said he would hide his
[21:31] face and would he
[21:32] wouldn't hear your prayers see that's
[21:34] the way
[21:36] oh you said that you're you're talking
[21:38] under the old testament brother man i'm
[21:40] all right let's take the new testament
[21:41] second timothy three
[21:42] the holy spirit warned us that in the
[21:44] last days that the church would get away
[21:46] from the sincerity
[21:47] and the faith they'd have a form of
[21:49] godliness but would deny the power that
[21:51] went with the right thing
[21:52] having a form of godliness but denying
[21:54] the power thereof yes sir
[21:56] god hates a powerless religion and any
[21:59] religion today that hasn't got christ in
[22:01] it
[22:01] is powerless but any religion that
[22:04] christ
[22:05] is in under his own blood in its got
[22:08] power in it
[22:09] you say god hates a religion without
[22:10] power he said your solemn feast is a
[22:12] stink
[22:13] i guess he does hate it he said it makes
[22:15] me sick
[22:16] and remember he told this rich laodicean
[22:19] church that because you're lukewarm
[22:20] in other words you make me sick i'll
[22:23] spew you out of my mouth
[22:25] and we've come to that age god send us
[22:27] an elisha to chop the thing to pieces
[22:29] lay it out before the people cry out
[22:31] spare not you think he'd be accepted
[22:34] certainly not
[22:35] but he'd cried just the same solemn
[22:37] feast they're a stink
[22:40] god hates powerless religion it's got to
[22:43] have power in it
[22:44] it's got to have sincerity sincerity
[22:47] brings power praise god amen
[22:51] catch this sincerity brings power
[22:53] sincerity brings
[22:55] real worship amen it doesn't matter
[22:58] what we call worship if there's no
[23:00] sincerity in the worship
[23:02] does god receive it amen
[23:06] so when we when we sing we sing with
[23:08] understanding and we sing in the spirit
[23:10] amen
[23:13] not sincerity brings real worship not
[23:15] forms but
[23:16] genuine power worship to know that you
[23:18] pass from death
[23:20] unto life we can sing songs amen
[23:24] but singing songs doesn't equal worship
[23:27] not worship to a true and living god
[23:30] amen but but there's a way to sing
[23:32] amen there's a way to sing that's real
[23:35] worship amen and when you sing with
[23:37] sincerity
[23:38] amen in sincerity and truth amen you're
[23:41] singing in real worship
[23:44] but if we just you know have our
[23:47] ritualistic form of we've got a couple
[23:49] songs we've got the pre-surface music
[23:51] we've got a couple songs we get to the
[23:53] preaching we have a few songs at the end
[23:55] listen it doesn't matter how correct it
[23:57] is and how established it is by the
[23:59] prophet of the age and how much
[24:01] it's in the structure in the form if
[24:02] it's done without sincerity
[24:04] amen it still becomes wrong
[24:08] we can make anything a tradition we can
[24:10] make the message a tradition we can make
[24:11] coming to church a tradition
[24:12] you can make your devotional prayer time
[24:15] amen you can make your time to listen to
[24:17] a message of tape
[24:18] you can make it a tradition
[24:22] amen but what's the thing that keeps a
[24:24] ritualistic form from becoming a
[24:27] tradition
[24:27] because waking up every day and praying
[24:29] is a ritual
[24:32] that right coming to church every sunday
[24:34] and every wednesday is a ritual
[24:36] amen coming to the feast and the new
[24:38] moons and in the daily
[24:40] oblations and the burning of incense it
[24:42] was a ritual but what kept the ritual
[24:45] from becoming a lifeless tradition
[24:47] amen is when you kept the revelation of
[24:49] what it means attached
[24:51] to the thing that we're doing and by
[24:53] revelation and sincerity and what god
[24:55] has done
[24:56] amen it keeps the ritual from becoming a
[24:59] tradition
[25:01] but when we lose sight of the depth of
[25:03] the meaning and what it means and what
[25:05] god has done for us
[25:06] and we lose sight of the love affair
[25:09] between us and the lord
[25:10] amen the ritual can easily become a
[25:12] tradition
[25:16] let's say god i want you to stay
[25:20] foremost in my mind i want to keep you
[25:22] in my heart
[25:23] day and night i don't want anything i do
[25:25] i don't ever want my daily devotion to
[25:28] become a tradition
[25:29] i don't want my prayer time to be a
[25:30] tradition i don't want
[25:32] i don't want the the time i come into
[25:34] church early and sit and get quiet
[25:36] i don't want it to be a tradition amen i
[25:38] want it to be a sincere form of worship
[25:42] i want to become a living reality a love
[25:45] relationship
[25:46] an opportunity for me to seek your face
[25:52] sincerity brings real worship sincerity
[25:56] brings power
[25:59] let's turn to isaiah 29
[26:09] when you begin to think about a sunday
[26:12] morning
[26:14] if you just begin to think as the sun
[26:16] comes up over the globe and moves
[26:18] and then from country to country in
[26:20] times of the time zone
[26:22] and that sunday how many church services
[26:24] will there be
[26:27] think of it globally how many church
[26:29] services will there be
[26:31] how many worship songs will be sung how
[26:34] many congregations of people will
[26:35] gather together and how many songs will
[26:38] be sung
[26:39] and how many sermons will be preached
[26:40] and how many bible verses will be read
[26:45] how many will have an exciting service
[26:49] or
[26:50] a deep service or a shallow service or a
[26:53] rejoicing service or
[26:54] a great song service or a great whatever
[26:56] it is how many of that will go on in a
[26:59] sunday
[27:00] and how much of that worship is received
[27:02] by a living god
[27:10] the whole babylonian system of religion
[27:13] is flawed it's failed
[27:18] man worshiping according to his own
[27:20] dictates his own desires
[27:22] man worshiping according to his own
[27:23] understanding in his own
[27:25] religion that he has made with his own
[27:27] hands his own idol
[27:28] idolatry it is all in vain
[27:35] isaiah 29 13
[27:38] says wherefore the lord said for as much
[27:40] as this people draw near me with their
[27:42] mouth and with their lips to honor me
[27:45] but have removed their heart far from me
[27:48] and their fear
[27:49] toward me is taught by the precept of
[27:52] man
[27:53] i want to read that again because it's
[27:55] such a devastating
[27:57] scripture and it should be a devastating
[27:59] scripture
[28:01] wherefore the lord said for as much as
[28:03] this people draw near me with their
[28:05] mouth
[28:06] and with their lips to honor me but have
[28:08] removed their heart
[28:10] far from me and their fear toward me is
[28:12] taught
[28:13] by the precept of men
[28:17] now you begin to see in the scripture
[28:20] what god really wanted
[28:23] did god want the noise from their lips
[28:27] or did he want their heart
[28:34] he wasn't after the noise from their
[28:36] lips because
[28:37] they draw near me with their lips amen
[28:40] they're speaking of him
[28:41] and singing of him and maybe singing
[28:44] songs about him
[28:45] but their heart is far from him and the
[28:47] fear of the lord the reverence and
[28:48] respect for the lord
[28:50] has just been taught by keeping of
[28:52] commandments by the precepts of men
[28:55] not a real sincere honor and reverence
[28:57] towards god
[28:58] and a real love for him now the the
[29:01] words are there
[29:03] but the heart isn't right
[29:07] and god this is a travesty because
[29:10] god is the one who's offended god is the
[29:13] one who is upset now
[29:15] because that's not why he established
[29:17] the order this is not why he gave them a
[29:19] form of worship this is not why he gave
[29:21] them a place to worship
[29:23] this is not why he set feast days and
[29:25] new
[29:26] moons and oblations and burning of
[29:28] incense and a priesthood
[29:29] he set all that in place so that they
[29:31] could draw nigh unto him
[29:33] so that they could have fellowship with
[29:34] him so he could dwell in their camp
[29:36] and so that they could have a god in
[29:38] their midst so that his presence could
[29:40] be among the nation
[29:44] but it got to the place where the
[29:46] presence of god could leave the nation
[29:49] and they never knew it because they were
[29:51] just doing it through a form of ritual
[29:55] because their heart had been removed
[29:58] brother bam says in the message
[30:00] conference 1963
[30:02] he says it's back to god's original
[30:04] decision at the first conference
[30:07] eden back to the blood the jew in the
[30:09] old days now i'm coming down home for
[30:11] pentecost just for a few minutes
[30:13] in the old days when god accepted his
[30:15] substitute how the jew used to come down
[30:17] the road with his slick bullock
[30:19] and he'd say you know i'm a sinner
[30:21] jehovah requires me to offer blood
[30:23] so he goes and gets his lamb or his
[30:25] bulldog he takes it down to the high
[30:27] priest down to the temple
[30:28] and he lays his hands upon his sacrifice
[30:31] what does that do that identifies the
[30:33] worshiper with his sacrifice
[30:35] and the priest comes and kills the
[30:36] bullock and catches the blood and
[30:38] sprinkles it upon
[30:40] and this worshiper sincerely knowing
[30:42] this jew
[30:43] that that's what jehovah required of him
[30:47] the man went home with a good feeling
[30:49] feeling the quiver and shake of the lamb
[30:52] the blood spraying all over his hands
[30:54] and so forth and see that little fellow
[30:56] kicking and dying
[30:57] as his throat cut he knowed that he
[31:00] ought to be that one
[31:02] he looked at his sacrifice he identified
[31:05] himself by laying his hands upon it
[31:07] i should be that one and then when that
[31:11] they cut its throat it dying and
[31:13] bleeding and going on
[31:15] the little fellow quivering and quieting
[31:17] down and the worshipers stand there and
[31:19] saying
[31:19] oh jehovah you've accepted that instead
[31:22] of me
[31:24] i'm ashamed of myself and the man went
[31:26] home justified because he had done
[31:28] exactly what jehovah required that was
[31:30] fine
[31:32] but by and by it become a family
[31:34] tradition
[31:35] now he takes his sacrifice say well
[31:38] let's see now
[31:38] oh yes it's getting to be new moon feast
[31:41] i guess i better
[31:42] it's a cleanse in the tabernacle it's a
[31:44] feast of pentecost
[31:45] i guess i better go down offer me a lamb
[31:47] go on down there and kill it
[31:49] with no feelings at all but go on back
[31:52] with the same idea he had coming in
[31:54] there
[31:56] and then what did he do jehovah said
[31:58] here in isaiah speaks a little later on
[32:00] he said your solemn feast had become a
[32:01] stink in my nose
[32:05] ew you know brother ben plays it out so
[32:09] clearly for us that what god wanted he
[32:12] wanted for the man to realize the cost
[32:14] of his sin
[32:14] he wanted to realize that god in his
[32:17] grace and in his mercy was accepting a
[32:19] substitute
[32:21] and the whole act of the substitute was
[32:23] to identify
[32:24] how grievous sin is that it requires the
[32:27] death of an innocent
[32:28] one as a substitute and it was all
[32:30] pointing towards christ
[32:32] and with sincerity the man would come
[32:35] amen recognizing that i'm the one who
[32:38] deserves to die
[32:39] i'm the one that's wrong i i've sinned i
[32:42] have failed and now this poor lamb has
[32:44] to die in my place
[32:45] but when you take all of the revelation
[32:47] and all of the feeling out of it
[32:49] now it's just a way that the man can
[32:51] live any way once and be okay because
[32:53] all he's got to do is do what jehovah
[32:55] said all i got to do is get me a lamb
[32:57] and go down there and give it to the
[32:58] priest
[32:59] he'll slay it and i go home and i'm fine
[33:03] but he was never fine because his heart
[33:05] wasn't right
[33:09] he had obeyed the word amen and god
[33:13] had obeyed the word he had obeyed the
[33:14] commandment but after a while to become
[33:16] a tradition god begins to speak against
[33:18] it
[33:19] against the very thing that he had set
[33:21] up
[33:23] let's turn to matthew 15. pick this up
[33:26] in the new testament here matthew
[33:28] chapter 15.
[33:40] matthew chapter 15 and verse 7.
[33:46] it says ye hypocrites well did isaias
[33:49] prophesy of you saying this people draw
[33:51] nine to me with their mouth and honors
[33:53] me with their lips
[33:54] but their heart is far from me but in
[33:57] vain they do worship me teaching for
[33:59] doctrines
[34:00] the commandments of men
[34:03] god through isaiah was telling a people
[34:06] back then that you've taken
[34:07] what i've given you and you've made it a
[34:09] tradition and now it's become a stink to
[34:11] me
[34:11] is i take no pleasure in it i hate your
[34:13] solemn feast
[34:15] and now jesus comes and he finds the
[34:18] very same thing now
[34:20] in his day and he's looking at them and
[34:21] he's saying well did isaiah is right of
[34:23] you
[34:23] that same spirit is still alive
[34:28] let's turn back and go to back to the
[34:31] old testament but let's go to amos
[34:48] amos chapter 5.
[34:56] amos chapter 5 and verse 21.
[35:04] i hate i despise your feast days
[35:11] you have to remember who gave them the
[35:14] feast days
[35:16] let's not lose sight of that i hate i
[35:19] despise your feast days
[35:21] and i will not smell in your solemn
[35:24] assemblies
[35:25] though you offer me burnt offerings in
[35:27] your meat offerings i will not accept
[35:28] them
[35:29] neither will i regard the peace
[35:30] offerings of your fat beasts
[35:33] take thou away from me the noise of thy
[35:36] songs
[35:37] oh my take thou away from me the noise
[35:42] of thy songs for i will not hear the
[35:44] melody of the viles
[35:48] but let judgment run down as waters and
[35:51] righteousness as a mighty stream
[35:53] have you offered unto me sacrifices and
[35:55] offerings in the wilderness 40 years old
[35:57] house of israel
[35:58] but you have borne the tabernacle of
[36:00] your moloch and
[36:02] and qin your images the star of your god
[36:04] which you have
[36:05] made to yourselves therefore will i
[36:07] cause you to go into captivity beyond
[36:09] damascus saith the lord
[36:11] whose name is thy god the god of hosts
[36:15] brother baby says in the message the
[36:17] evening messenger in 1963 said isaiah
[36:19] the prophet
[36:20] how he testified prophesied at the end
[36:22] time he said the whole body would come
[36:24] full of putrefied sores every table
[36:27] would be full of vomit
[36:28] why men and women today they take the
[36:30] communion living with two or three wives
[36:32] or two or three husbands right
[36:33] and all kinds smoke cigarettes and all
[36:35] these things come into the church
[36:37] taking communion that's no sincerity
[36:42] in the message communion from 1965 he
[36:45] says you don't take the lord's supper by
[36:47] a tradition
[36:48] you take it because it's the love of god
[36:50] in your heart
[36:52] why do you take communion not just
[36:54] because we have communion in the first
[36:56] service we take it because of the love
[36:58] of god in our hearts
[37:00] you take it because it's the love of god
[37:02] in your heart and keeping the
[37:03] commandments of god see what
[37:04] see that's what you take it for so if
[37:07] you don't take it in sincerity it's just
[37:09] a tradition
[37:11] well our church observes communion every
[37:12] sunday or once every month or twice a
[37:14] year
[37:15] or you go up say well it's my time and
[37:17] then take the communion why
[37:18] it's a stink to god see that's just a
[37:21] tradition
[37:22] even like anything else you've got to be
[37:24] sincere
[37:25] god wants the depths from your heart
[37:28] you remember the very god that brought
[37:30] you here on earth as the one you're
[37:31] serving
[37:33] you're doing this because he said so
[37:35] because it's his order
[37:37] then we want to come up with deepness of
[37:39] sincerity
[37:40] knowing that by god's grace that we have
[37:42] been saved we love him and
[37:44] we feel his presence and we see it
[37:46] changed our life change our lives
[37:48] our whole being is changed we're
[37:50] different people we don't live like we
[37:52] used to we don't think like we used to
[37:55] we come to the communion brother
[37:57] remember just using this as one order
[37:58] one form of the church
[37:59] we come to the communion with this with
[38:02] this in mind
[38:02] a deep love in our heart and a deep
[38:05] sincerity in our heart
[38:06] because of what god's done for us amen
[38:09] what we could not do for ourselves he's
[38:11] done for us
[38:11] and what has he revealed to us in this
[38:13] day that we live in now
[38:15] how we understand more than they've
[38:17] understood in the previous ages of the
[38:19] depths of what that means
[38:20] and what god's done for us the
[38:24] revelation doesn't
[38:25] lighten calvary amen it expands it amen
[38:30] the revelation it shows the full picture
[38:33] of what god's done than the full picture
[38:35] of redemption
[38:36] and we of all people amen should be able
[38:38] to come to everything that god has
[38:40] established with a fullness in our heart
[38:42] we should sing like nobody else on earth
[38:44] sings amen
[38:46] and i don't mean loud i don't mean slow
[38:47] i don't mean fast i'm not talking about
[38:49] that
[38:50] i'm talking about with the deep
[38:51] sincerity in the heart we should sing
[38:53] like
[38:53] nobody else on the planet sings
[38:57] who else knows what god had in the mind
[38:59] the back part of his mind before the
[39:01] foundation of the world
[39:02] who knows with the efforts that he's put
[39:04] in and everything that he's done to get
[39:06] you
[39:07] here this day with this revelation
[39:09] that's here this day
[39:10] how god brought a man from kentucky
[39:12] every church age that lined up just
[39:14] right
[39:14] and he brought empires up and he tore
[39:17] empires down
[39:18] amen and he moved systems and and he
[39:20] moved people and individuals
[39:21] to get you here today that you could
[39:23] receive the revelation of the mystery of
[39:26] god that was in the back part of his
[39:27] mind
[39:28] amen why would we come to church and say
[39:30] i
[39:31] love him
[39:35] [Applause]
[39:37] not us friends not us not here
[39:40] not in me but let me come and say god
[39:43] you've done
[39:43] everything for me where should i be
[39:47] i should be stuck in some system
[39:48] somewhere i should be
[39:50] you know i should be messed up in some
[39:52] wrong marriage i should be messed up in
[39:54] some wrong situation
[39:56] i in my own thinking by my own way
[39:59] and with my own human desires would have
[40:01] ruined my life amen
[40:03] and i was trying running as hard as i
[40:05] can to ruin my life
[40:06] but you grabbed me you picked me up you
[40:09] washed me with clean water
[40:12] you revealed yourself to me
[40:17] and now when i walk when i'm driving the
[40:20] church amen
[40:22] when i'm waking in the morning to listen
[40:24] to the message to
[40:25] to read my bible lord let me not get
[40:29] stuck in a rut
[40:30] lord help me god never to get into into
[40:33] the tradition of a thing but let me
[40:36] never forget what you've done for me
[40:41] every time we open our bibles let's do
[40:43] it with feeling
[40:45] sincerity this is the love letter
[40:52] could you imagine opening the love
[40:53] letter out of a tradition
[40:57] or a formalistic ritual because it was
[41:00] commanded to you by the prophet that
[41:03] you know a christian prays and reads his
[41:04] bible every day he has to
[41:08] well better open the love letter that's
[41:11] not how you open a love letter
[41:15] you open the love letter you smell it
[41:17] and you touch it
[41:22] amen god wrote this for me
[41:27] god sent a prophet and they revealed the
[41:29] words in this book
[41:30] for me there may be others included in
[41:34] this too but
[41:35] right now when i'm opening this book and
[41:37] the privacy of my home
[41:38] i'm not interested in who else he wrote
[41:40] it for he wrote it for me
[41:42] he revealed it to me amen he sent the
[41:44] prophet for me
[41:48] it should affect everything we do
[41:51] we cannot assume that just because
[41:55] we've received the message of the hour
[41:56] that we're immune
[42:00] from all the vices that go with the
[42:02] human life
[42:04] but we've got to guard against these
[42:06] things because the outer man
[42:08] is to be brought subject to the inner
[42:09] man
[42:14] god will keep his bride correct his
[42:17] bride
[42:18] wake up his bride because he won't lose
[42:22] her
[42:22] amen
[42:26] but i don't want him to have to chase me
[42:28] down and spank me
[42:31] because i was not diligent with what he
[42:34] told me
[42:35] when he does thank me i'm thankful
[42:38] because as rod and his staff they
[42:40] comfort me
[42:42] but i want to give of a willing heart
[42:46] i want to do everything i do with the
[42:50] deepness of sincerity
[42:52] and the love that he deserves when i bow
[42:55] my head and pray
[42:56] i want to pray with thanksgiving in my
[42:58] heart
[43:00] even if it's praying over a meal like
[43:02] i've done thousands of times
[43:04] when i bow my head i don't want to say
[43:06] god thank you for this food
[43:07] we all get into those habits but i want
[43:09] to stop that
[43:11] and i want to say god provided this for
[43:14] me
[43:15] i want to take it with thanksgiving in
[43:17] my home
[43:20] let's turn to jeremiah chapter 7.
[43:30] see if you think about where israel was
[43:34] they had the promise of abraham in their
[43:38] life
[43:39] they were placed in the promised land
[43:41] but through circumstances in a prophecy
[43:44] they
[43:44] went out of the land and they went into
[43:46] egypt and they were sold into slavery in
[43:48] bondage in egypt for generations and
[43:51] but god with a mighty hand by his great
[43:53] mercy and his great love
[43:54] he rescued them he brought them out of
[43:58] egypt amen
[43:59] and he showed how mighty and powerful he
[44:01] was amen when he destroyed egypt and
[44:03] destroyed pharaoh's army
[44:04] and he brought them out with a mighty
[44:06] hand and they come out mighty victors
[44:09] with the spoil all because of god not
[44:11] because of them
[44:13] they had no strength no power but they
[44:15] come out with gold and they come out
[44:17] with
[44:17] precious metal and jewels and with
[44:19] garments they come out
[44:20] singing and they come out dancing they
[44:22] came out the victor amen because of him
[44:26] and he brought them through the
[44:27] wilderness journey and he shielded them
[44:29] from all forces and and he moved them
[44:31] into the promised land and
[44:32] he drove out the inhabitants of the land
[44:35] and he gave him
[44:36] a temple and he gave him a priesthood
[44:37] and he gave him all these things that he
[44:40] gave to them
[44:42] and they started off grateful
[44:45] they started off thankful but then
[44:48] generation by generation and
[44:51] one day leads into the next day and the
[44:53] next day becomes just like the day
[44:55] before and tomorrow has no prospect of
[44:57] being different than today and
[44:58] they begin to get into a rhythm of life
[45:04] and they began to forget they didn't
[45:06] keep in the forefront of their hearts
[45:08] and their minds
[45:10] what god had done for them
[45:14] and then because they failed to drive
[45:16] out all the inhabitants of the land like
[45:18] they were instructed they didn't keep
[45:19] the full word
[45:21] now those things that they put under
[45:22] tribute they began to
[45:24] come back and they began to entice them
[45:28] and they began to get enticed with the
[45:30] gods of the land and the other forms of
[45:32] worship and
[45:33] they began to to mix the worship of
[45:35] jehovah with the worship of
[45:37] baal and some of these other gods
[45:41] and they kept the ritual going they kept
[45:44] the ritual
[45:45] and it became a tradition amen but
[45:48] because they had settled down and quit
[45:50] striving quit reaching forth in the
[45:53] spirit
[45:55] quit seeking his face quit desiring more
[45:58] of his presence
[45:59] they got happy with the portion that
[46:01] they were given
[46:02] they become content amen and didn't
[46:05] drive out all the inhabitants they
[46:06] became content
[46:08] with what they had and contentment
[46:10] turned into complacency
[46:15] and then now the the the devils that
[46:19] were around them begin to tempt them
[46:22] they quit fighting now they begin to get
[46:25] tempted and now
[46:26] they begin to worship jehovah
[46:29] out of tradition
[46:33] and not with the sincerity that was in
[46:35] their hearts
[46:39] let's look at jeremiah chapter 7
[46:42] verse 9.
[46:46] will you steal murder and commit
[46:49] adultery
[46:50] and swear falsely and burn incense to
[46:52] baal
[46:53] and walk after other gods whom you knew
[46:55] not and come
[46:56] and stand before me in this house
[46:59] which is called by my name and say we
[47:01] are delivered to do all these
[47:03] abominations
[47:06] he said will you really do everything i
[47:09] told you not to do
[47:10] and come into this house and worship
[47:17] and worship and say we've been delivered
[47:21] delivered to do what deliver to keep all
[47:24] the abominations and the murders and the
[47:25] lie
[47:26] and the false this and that they've
[47:29] gotten so desensitized
[47:31] they've gone to a place amen where they
[47:33] can come to church
[47:34] amen they could listen and listen to the
[47:37] priest they could do the form
[47:38] and the ritual and they could continue
[47:41] on in the compromise they were in
[47:43] amen and they got so ritualistic in
[47:46] their worship
[47:47] and they got so uh they lost
[47:50] touch with the feeling and heart for god
[47:55] that their selfishness and their
[47:56] self-desire would come into
[47:58] manifestation and all these things
[47:59] but they would still go to the house of
[48:02] god and they would still worship and say
[48:03] we're delivered to do all of these
[48:05] things
[48:10] my my mind verse 11 is this house which
[48:13] is called by my name become a den of
[48:15] robbers in your eyes
[48:17] behold even i have seen it saith the
[48:19] lord but go you now into my place which
[48:22] is in shiloh where i set my name at
[48:24] first
[48:24] and see what i did to it for the
[48:26] wickedness of my people
[48:28] israel and now because you have done all
[48:31] these works saith the lord
[48:33] and i spake unto you rising up early and
[48:35] speaking but you heard not
[48:37] and i called you but you answered not
[48:38] therefore will i do unto this house
[48:41] which is called by my name
[48:42] wherein you trust and unto the place
[48:44] which i gave to you
[48:46] to your fathers as i have done to shiloh
[48:48] and i will cast you out of my sight as i
[48:50] have cast out all your brethren even the
[48:52] whole seed of
[48:53] ephraim therefore pray not thou for this
[48:56] people neither lift up
[48:58] cry nor prayer for them neither make
[49:00] intercession to me for i will not
[49:02] hear thee you tell jeremiah jeremiah is
[49:05] now speaking to judah
[49:06] amen the nation of israel has already
[49:08] been carried away captive by the
[49:10] assyrians and now
[49:11] the babylonians are going to come to
[49:12] take judah
[49:14] and benjamin and now he's speaking to
[49:16] them and he's starting to declare
[49:18] what the problem is what the issue is
[49:20] they've lost sincerity they've lost the
[49:21] feeling for god
[49:22] they were keeping the ritual just so
[49:24] that they could be okay but they were
[49:25] still involved in all these things that
[49:27] god hated
[49:28] and god is telling them you think that
[49:31] i'm going to let this go on
[49:32] look at shiloh he said look at shiloh
[49:36] and when you know what shiloh is when
[49:38] they came amen when they came into the
[49:40] land
[49:41] amen joshua comes and he sets up the
[49:43] tabernacle
[49:44] in shiloh shiloh becomes the first seat
[49:47] of religion
[49:48] in the middle of israel in joshua 18
[49:52] 1 i'll just read it to you and the whole
[49:53] congregation of the children of israel
[49:55] assembled together at shiloh
[49:57] and set up the tabernacle of the
[49:58] congregation there and the land was
[50:00] subdued before them
[50:02] so joshua was the first place that god
[50:05] had set his tabernacle
[50:06] and when they all were to gather for
[50:07] their feast when they were all
[50:09] the required gathering of all the men of
[50:11] israel three times a year
[50:13] would come to shiloh amen and shiloh god
[50:15] had established
[50:16] but he says now look at shiloh if you
[50:19] want to know what's going to happen look
[50:20] at shiloh
[50:21] god had placed his tabernacle in shiloh
[50:25] god had put his presence in shiloh god
[50:27] had told him to gather the shiloh but at
[50:29] that time
[50:30] shiloh was a waste place
[50:35] let's turn to the book of psalms psalm
[50:38] 78.
[50:48] psalm 78 and verse 50.
[50:53] psalm 78 and 50.
[50:57] he made a way to his anger he spared not
[51:00] their soul from death but gave their
[51:01] life over to pestilence
[51:03] and smote all the firstborn in egypt the
[51:05] chief of their strength in the
[51:07] tabernacles of ham
[51:09] but made his own people to go forth like
[51:11] sheep and guided them in the wilderness
[51:13] like a flock
[51:14] and he led them on safely so that they
[51:16] feared not but to see
[51:18] overwhelm their enemies and he brought
[51:20] them to the border of this of a
[51:22] sanctuary
[51:24] even to his mountain which his right
[51:25] hand had purchased
[51:27] he cast out the heathen also before them
[51:29] and divided them an inheritance by line
[51:33] and he made the tribe of israel to dwell
[51:35] in their tents
[51:36] yet they tempted and provoked the most
[51:38] high god and kept modest testimonies
[51:40] but turned back and dealt unfaithfully
[51:42] like their fathers they were
[51:43] turned aside like a deceitful bow for
[51:46] they provoked him to anger with their
[51:48] high places and moved him to jealousy
[51:50] with their graven images when god heard
[51:52] this he was wroth and greatly aboard
[51:54] israel
[51:55] so that he forsook the tabernacle of
[51:57] shiloh the tent which he placed among
[51:59] men
[52:00] and delivered his strength into
[52:01] captivity in his glory unto the enemy's
[52:03] hand
[52:04] he gave his people over also into the
[52:06] sword and was wrath
[52:08] with his inheritance you picked this
[52:11] story up in first samuel chapter four
[52:13] but
[52:14] in the days of samuel as a boy and eli
[52:17] as the high priest and
[52:18] eli's two sons they were in shiloh
[52:21] ministering
[52:22] unto the lord in shiloh and they were
[52:24] gathering unto shiloh and the
[52:26] the tabernacle was there and the ark of
[52:28] the covenant was there
[52:30] but there was wickedness that was taking
[52:32] place in the worship
[52:34] in the tabernacle because uh
[52:37] hoffney and phineas the two sons of eli
[52:39] they were wicked amen and eli would
[52:41] bring no correction to them and so
[52:43] so the priesthood became wicked and it
[52:45] became to have an ill effect among the
[52:47] people
[52:49] and this was shiloh this was the place
[52:51] that god set his tabernacle this is the
[52:54] place where god would meet his people
[52:58] but when the worship was polluted and
[53:00] corrupted and they no longer had a heart
[53:02] for god
[53:04] there come a day that the philistines
[53:06] were gathering against them and
[53:07] they lost in battle and they said let us
[53:09] go get the ark amen and bring the ark
[53:12] forth and
[53:13] and they they believed when they brought
[53:14] the ark forth it would bring forth the
[53:16] presence of god
[53:17] and they brought the ark forth and and
[53:19] and they moved it into battle amen
[53:21] and the philistines conquered him that
[53:23] day and took the ark that's why in
[53:24] psalms it said he delivered his strength
[53:26] unto enemies
[53:28] he gave the very ark amen which is a
[53:30] symbol of his presence his seat among
[53:32] him his throne in the tabernacle
[53:34] and he allowed the philistines to carry
[53:36] it away and it became
[53:37] captive to the philistines you think how
[53:40] could god do a thing like that
[53:42] amen god it'll never happen to us it'll
[53:45] they'll never let the philistines take
[53:47] his seat
[53:48] god's more powerful amen god was showing
[53:50] i have removed my presence from you
[53:53] amen i'm no longer with you and god was
[53:55] not
[53:56] worried about the seat god was worried
[53:58] about his relationship with them
[54:02] amen that article of furniture only
[54:04] represented his presence over the word
[54:07] in the in the holy place in the holy of
[54:09] holies amen it was a representation
[54:11] but he was going to allow that piece of
[54:13] furniture which was so holy to them
[54:15] which was so sacred to them he was going
[54:17] to allow it to go to the philistines
[54:19] and become captive by dirty hands and be
[54:22] brought into a heathen camp because god
[54:24] wasn't interested in the furniture he
[54:26] was interested in them
[54:32] god will then allow his tabernacle that
[54:34] he instructed moses to build
[54:36] and gave details on how to build it and
[54:38] build it as a reflection of the one in
[54:39] heaven he would allow it to fall into
[54:41] ruin
[54:43] say how could he do it he was doing it
[54:45] because he was trying to free the people
[54:47] from their tradition
[54:48] he was trying to break them away from
[54:51] their traditional understanding
[54:53] and realize that they needed him amen
[54:55] they needed him they didn't need a
[54:57] ritual they needed him
[54:59] they didn't need a form they didn't need
[55:00] a covering they needed him
[55:03] they needed him to be their covering
[55:05] they needed him to be their form they
[55:06] needed him to be their ritual
[55:09] when they lost sight of him he let
[55:11] everything else that was so holy
[55:13] and so pure and so right fall into ruin
[55:21] praise god praise god amen
[55:31] let's go to jeremiah 24.
[55:48] you realize in shiloh that day
[55:51] when those corrupt priests took and
[55:55] thought they were going to bring
[55:56] the presence of god over the word of god
[55:59] into the battle
[56:00] and there's no way we'll lose
[56:04] because we've got the tat we've got the
[56:07] tablets of stone that god
[56:09] gave the covenant between us and him us
[56:12] and god in the place he told us to put
[56:16] it
[56:16] the very word from his own hand
[56:20] in the very vessel he told us to put it
[56:22] carried by the very priesthood that he
[56:24] established
[56:25] there's no way this will not work
[56:28] and what looked like a surefire plan to
[56:31] take the word of god into battle
[56:33] and with the word will have his presence
[56:34] and nothing can defeat it and when they
[56:36] go into battle
[56:37] and not only are they defeated but it's
[56:40] taken how could
[56:44] god do it how could god do it
[56:48] amen because god
[56:51] was not going to back up their false
[56:53] worship he was no longer going to
[56:55] support
[56:56] their corrupt heart amen their heart had
[56:58] pulled far from him there was a
[56:59] corruption in the priesthood
[57:01] and he was no longer going to support
[57:02] him
[57:06] they will take the word of god it will
[57:07] never fail if your heart is not right if
[57:12] your heart is not right
[57:13] god may very well let it fail so you
[57:15] recognize your heart's not right
[57:17] because god is never wrong and god has
[57:19] never failed
[57:23] it's not a repeating of something it's
[57:25] not an incantation it's not a just a
[57:27] bold claim of something
[57:29] amen it's a sincere worship to god and a
[57:32] revelation of his word
[57:33] amen and a heart that's connected to god
[57:35] and a real connection with god and a
[57:37] belief
[57:38] knowing that he's god and his word won't
[57:40] fail
[57:42] but they were just trying to use it
[57:46] for their own benefit because they
[57:48] didn't reverence it
[57:50] those two priests that were now carrying
[57:52] the word they were the very ones
[57:54] committing fornication right next to
[57:56] that
[57:57] holy place right within the tabernacle
[58:01] they were committing fornication showing
[58:02] that they had no reverence
[58:04] no fear no respect for that word
[58:08] but when the demon powers come against
[58:10] them and they needed a victory
[58:12] they tried to take the word and forced
[58:14] the word into action but they had no
[58:16] reverence for the very word that they
[58:18] were now carrying
[58:28] we want to claim the word and claim the
[58:30] promise but do we have reverence for the
[58:32] very promise
[58:33] have we been committing spiritual
[58:34] fornication right in the presence of the
[58:36] very ark that we're now trying to carry
[58:42] help us god help us god to come
[58:45] reverently
[58:46] and humbly to him every moment of every
[58:49] day
[58:50] and stay so close to him that when we
[58:53] need him we know he's close
[58:55] and we know he's here
[58:58] we don't play games with god we don't
[59:01] play games with god's word
[59:04] jeremiah 24 4
[59:08] and i will set up shepherds over them no
[59:11] i'm sorry i'm in the wrong verse 24 and
[59:13] 4.
[59:14] again the word of the lord came unto me
[59:16] saying thus saith the lord the god of
[59:18] israel
[59:19] like those good figs so will i
[59:20] acknowledge them that are carried away
[59:22] captive
[59:23] of judah whom i have sent out of this
[59:25] place into the land of the chaldeans for
[59:27] their good
[59:29] for their good
[59:32] god was now breaking up
[59:36] judah he was now bringing jerusalem
[59:40] captive and he showed a vision
[59:44] unto jeremiah of good figs and bad figs
[59:46] and the good figs
[59:48] are the ones he's talking about he's
[59:49] going to carry them away to the land of
[59:51] chaldeans
[59:52] for their good
[59:55] you say how could this be for their good
[1:00:00] verse 6 for i will set mine eyes upon
[1:00:04] them for good and i will bring them
[1:00:05] again to this land
[1:00:06] and i will build them and not pull them
[1:00:08] down and i will plant them and not pluck
[1:00:10] them up
[1:00:11] and i will give them a heart to know me
[1:00:13] that i am the lord
[1:00:14] and they shall be my people and i will
[1:00:16] be their god for they shall return
[1:00:18] unto me with their whole heart
[1:00:24] he's passed the judgment through
[1:00:25] jeremiah that because of the corruption
[1:00:28] amen that is in jerusalem because
[1:00:30] of the insincerity and the lack of love
[1:00:33] in their worship
[1:00:34] he was going to allow the whole thing to
[1:00:36] go captive and he was going to allow
[1:00:38] nebuchadnezzar to come in
[1:00:39] and take them captive and he was going
[1:00:41] to allow them
[1:00:42] to destroy the very
[1:00:46] temple that solomon built
[1:00:50] surely surely god won't let this temple
[1:00:53] be destroyed god
[1:00:54] let it be destroyed god
[1:00:57] prophesied that it would happen god
[1:00:59] prophesied that they would be
[1:01:01] led captive and he said i will take
[1:01:03] these good figs
[1:01:04] to the land of chaldeans for their own
[1:01:06] good
[1:01:08] i will separate them from the word i
[1:01:10] will separate them from jerusalem amen
[1:01:13] from the church i will separate them for
[1:01:15] their own good
[1:01:16] so that i can bring them back and when
[1:01:18] they come back they will have a heart
[1:01:20] for me amen
[1:01:21] they will love me they will worship me
[1:01:22] they will know me
[1:01:28] what are we looking at the church ages
[1:01:33] already in the first church age in the
[1:01:35] ephesian church age he's talking to them
[1:01:37] and says
[1:01:38] i have somewhat against you because
[1:01:39] you've left your first
[1:01:41] love
[1:01:45] they had the word they they had the
[1:01:47] epistles that were written by the
[1:01:48] apostles and by paul
[1:01:50] amen but they begin to already cool off
[1:01:52] they begin
[1:01:53] already settled into a form
[1:01:58] and they had already left their first
[1:02:00] love in
[1:02:02] ephesus means aimed at and relaxed they
[1:02:06] had
[1:02:06] aimed at but they they no longer had a
[1:02:08] desire
[1:02:09] to reach forth in the spirit they became
[1:02:11] comfortable in the worship amen they
[1:02:13] begin to relax
[1:02:16] he says you've left your first love
[1:02:20] and we know that the address to the
[1:02:22] church ages is addressing two groups
[1:02:26] and god is speaking to each church age
[1:02:27] because within each church gates
[1:02:29] two groups and he's telling them you've
[1:02:31] left your first love
[1:02:32] and he's going to allow this church to
[1:02:35] be carried
[1:02:35] captive to babylon
[1:02:38] he's going to allow the word to be
[1:02:40] separated from them
[1:02:43] is that true down through thyatira
[1:02:46] through the dark ages
[1:02:47] they ban bibles they burn them they made
[1:02:49] it they forbid
[1:02:50] you'd have a bible in your language they
[1:02:52] forbid it to be translated into the
[1:02:53] language of the common tongue
[1:02:55] so only the priest had the bible and
[1:02:57] only in latin
[1:02:59] so that you had the word the word had
[1:03:02] been removed
[1:03:04] from the church they had been taken
[1:03:06] captive in the babylon and the thyatiran
[1:03:08] age they were captive in babylon
[1:03:12] why for your good amen
[1:03:17] so that he could return her captivity
[1:03:23] let's look at jeremiah 29
[1:03:28] very familiar scripture but i want to
[1:03:30] read it in this context the context that
[1:03:32] is placed here in the scriptures
[1:03:35] jeremiah 29 and 10
[1:03:39] for thus saith the lord that after
[1:03:41] seventy years be accomplished at babylon
[1:03:43] i will visit you
[1:03:45] and perform my good word towards you and
[1:03:47] causing you to return to this place
[1:03:50] god before he sent them away was
[1:03:53] prophesying of their coming back
[1:03:56] so the question what was more important
[1:03:57] to him the sending away or the coming
[1:03:59] back
[1:04:02] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:04:04] toward you saith the lord thoughts of
[1:04:06] peace and not of evil
[1:04:07] to give you an expected end then shall
[1:04:10] you call
[1:04:11] upon me and you shall go and pray unto
[1:04:13] me and i will hearken
[1:04:14] unto you and you shall seek me and find
[1:04:17] me
[1:04:18] when you shall search for me with all
[1:04:20] your heart
[1:04:21] something's going to change in the
[1:04:23] return amen
[1:04:25] something is going to be different with
[1:04:27] the group that comes back
[1:04:28] out of captivity out of babylon they're
[1:04:31] not going to be like the group that went
[1:04:32] in
[1:04:33] it's going to be different when they
[1:04:34] come back
[1:04:36] and god is prophesying he's saying
[1:04:40] i will bring you back to this place i
[1:04:43] know the thoughts i have towards you
[1:04:46] to give you an expected end it only
[1:04:48] looks like evil but it's really good
[1:04:52] the church ages looked evil but they
[1:04:53] were really good
[1:04:55] it looked like it was all bad but there
[1:04:57] was something wonderful it was a mystery
[1:04:59] laying in the seven church ages
[1:05:01] and it was a mystery of the restoration
[1:05:03] of the bride tree
[1:05:08] he says i want to read verse 12 again
[1:05:11] then shall you call upon me o
[1:05:15] praise god why did they call upon him
[1:05:19] because he already prophesied they would
[1:05:20] be there
[1:05:22] he already knew there would be a remnant
[1:05:24] there would be a group you know when it
[1:05:25] came time to come back out of 70 years
[1:05:27] of captivity
[1:05:28] they didn't all want to come back they
[1:05:30] had got comfortable in babylon
[1:05:32] they looked comfortable under the the
[1:05:34] benefits they still had a form of their
[1:05:36] jewish tradition
[1:05:37] they still had jewish worship but they
[1:05:39] got comfortable in the benefits of
[1:05:41] babylon
[1:05:42] and they liked babylon and now when they
[1:05:44] had the opportunity to come back
[1:05:45] they didn't all come back some refused
[1:05:48] to come back
[1:05:51] but he knew there would be a people that
[1:05:54] would come back
[1:05:56] because he already saw it he already
[1:05:58] predestinated and he already prophesied
[1:06:01] that they would come back in verse 12
[1:06:04] then shall you call upon me
[1:06:08] and say why did they call upon him
[1:06:09] because he said they would
[1:06:12] because he said they would and you shall
[1:06:15] go and pray unto me and i will
[1:06:17] hearken unto you and you shall seek me
[1:06:19] and find me
[1:06:20] when you search for me with all your
[1:06:22] heart
[1:06:24] and i will be found of you saith the
[1:06:26] lord and i will turn away your captivity
[1:06:29] and i will gather you from all the
[1:06:30] nations from all the places whether i
[1:06:32] have driven you sayeth the lord
[1:06:33] and i will bring you again unto the
[1:06:35] place once i cause you to be carried
[1:06:37] away
[1:06:38] captive oh praise
[1:06:42] god
[1:06:45] god took the very thing that he built
[1:06:48] and he broke it the very thing
[1:06:51] it looked like it'd be impossible he'll
[1:06:53] never destroy jerusalem he'll
[1:06:54] never he'll never let the vessels be
[1:06:56] carried away he'll never let us
[1:06:58] lose the ark of the covenant he'll never
[1:07:00] tear down solomon's temple
[1:07:02] and he let it all go to ruin
[1:07:06] but he had a remnant he was looking for
[1:07:09] they were going to go
[1:07:10] captive for a little while into babylon
[1:07:13] but in due
[1:07:13] season he was going to bring a remnant
[1:07:15] out of that
[1:07:17] and he was going to bring them back into
[1:07:19] the place of worship
[1:07:20] back to the proper place of worship
[1:07:23] bring him back to jerusalem
[1:07:24] back to the restoration of the temple
[1:07:26] back to the word
[1:07:28] and he said you'll be there don't worry
[1:07:31] you'll be there
[1:07:33] and you'll call and i'll answer you'll
[1:07:35] hear my word
[1:07:36] you'll be there because i predestinated
[1:07:39] you to be there there will be a remnant
[1:07:42] that will come out of babylon
[1:07:43] i broke the system for your good.
[1:07:49] and when the churches began to fall into
[1:07:52] tradition into routine
[1:07:53] through ephesus through cerner through
[1:07:55] through pergamus
[1:07:56] amen he allowed them to go captive in
[1:07:58] the babylon and
[1:08:00] broke them
[1:08:04] because he didn't want this church to
[1:08:05] continue on that way
[1:08:07] he wanted them to have a love
[1:08:08] relationship with him he wanted to have
[1:08:10] a revelation of what was in his mind
[1:08:12] he wanted to share with them his very
[1:08:15] person
[1:08:17] but he couldn't do it under that
[1:08:18] ritualistic form under that tradition of
[1:08:20] man
[1:08:21] amen so he broke the thing and let it go
[1:08:23] into complete darkness
[1:08:25] as if it was dead he let it he let those
[1:08:27] insects eat the fruit
[1:08:29] eat the leaves eat the bark i mean their
[1:08:31] doctrine and then the very life they
[1:08:33] sucked the sap
[1:08:35] until it got down to just a stump
[1:08:40] and said god didn't let that happen he
[1:08:42] prophesied before it happened
[1:08:45] he wrote it in revelation chapter 2 and
[1:08:48] chapter 3
[1:08:48] before it ever happened he wrote it back
[1:08:50] in joel before it ever
[1:08:52] happened god knew it would happen
[1:08:54] because he had to break that thing
[1:08:55] so that you and i would seek him with
[1:08:58] all of our heart so that you and i would
[1:09:00] come to him
[1:09:01] and seek him and be found of him
[1:09:08] when he was breaking that system he had
[1:09:10] you in mind
[1:09:13] when that church was going into
[1:09:14] captivity
[1:09:16] he had you in mind
[1:09:20] you see why this is not going to be a
[1:09:22] tradition to us amen the bride is not
[1:09:24] going to let this truth become a
[1:09:26] tradition
[1:09:27] the bride is not going to let this
[1:09:28] become a ritualistic form of some family
[1:09:30] tradition
[1:09:31] a multi-generational form of worship
[1:09:33] because she was the one that he broke it
[1:09:35] for
[1:09:36] he broke it for this bride he broke the
[1:09:38] system
[1:09:39] let it go into ruin so that he could
[1:09:40] gradually bring it back so that when you
[1:09:43] come
[1:09:43] he would you would call he would answer
[1:09:47] that he would have a people not like the
[1:09:49] people who went into babylon but
[1:09:51] the people coming out would be the
[1:09:52] people that would seek for him with all
[1:09:54] of their hearts
[1:09:59] let's turn to the book of joel
[1:10:02] praise be to god
[1:10:11] you know we wonder why we've been so
[1:10:12] many things
[1:10:14] been through so much trouble it's almost
[1:10:17] like
[1:10:18] for individual lives some individual
[1:10:20] lives have taken the same route
[1:10:24] sometimes we think
[1:10:27] that sometimes we think that the worst
[1:10:31] thing that ever happens to somebody
[1:10:34] is that the church depart over the group
[1:10:36] or the system or the
[1:10:37] whatever movement within the message
[1:10:38] gets all broke up they get dispersed and
[1:10:40] we lose track of them sometimes it's the
[1:10:42] best thing that ever happened
[1:10:46] god breaks something and he scatters the
[1:10:50] people
[1:10:52] so that in his due season he can bring
[1:10:54] them back and when they come back
[1:10:56] there are people that are going to call
[1:10:57] on him with all of their heart amen
[1:10:59] they've learned something something has
[1:11:01] changed and the church ages are there
[1:11:03] for us
[1:11:04] amen to gain an understanding not to go
[1:11:06] that way
[1:11:10] sometimes we think a young person amen
[1:11:12] going out and getting broken and
[1:11:13] separating from the world that's the
[1:11:14] worst thing that could ever happen and
[1:11:16] no doubt there's scars and trouble that
[1:11:17] will come
[1:11:18] but maybe that's the very thing that god
[1:11:20] saw before the foundation of the world
[1:11:22] because it's the very thing that's going
[1:11:24] to cause them to seek for him with all
[1:11:26] of their heart
[1:11:27] they may have been getting into a
[1:11:28] ritualistic form into a traditional
[1:11:30] formula and god didn't want that for his
[1:11:33] bride he did not want that for your
[1:11:35] child your loved one so he would
[1:11:37] break them break them
[1:11:40] and scatter them away from the word
[1:11:44] say how can he do it how can he do it
[1:11:46] because he's already
[1:11:47] saul i will bring you back amen you're
[1:11:50] coming back to this place
[1:11:53] you won't be scattered forever you won't
[1:11:55] be separated forever
[1:11:56] you're coming back and i'd like to say
[1:11:59] come back to jerusalem amen it's time
[1:12:02] for the in
[1:12:03] gathering of the gods seed
[1:12:06] come back i will bring you back and you
[1:12:09] will seek for me
[1:12:10] you will find me when you seek for me
[1:12:14] you will call and i will listen
[1:12:18] you will find me
[1:12:22] that's a prophecy there's no guessing at
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:26] you will find me when you search for me
[1:12:29] with all of your heart why were those
[1:12:32] coming out of captivity willing to
[1:12:34] search with all their heart
[1:12:35] because they had been sent out into
[1:12:37] captivity
[1:12:39] they no longer had the false security of
[1:12:41] the tradition
[1:12:42] they no longer had the false security of
[1:12:44] the system amen
[1:12:45] that thing was broken so that they could
[1:12:48] find the security that comes from
[1:12:50] seeking him
[1:12:51] with all of their hearts
[1:12:56] and the very thing god broke
[1:12:59] when they come back with the right
[1:13:00] approach
[1:13:02] and the right heart he would have him
[1:13:05] build back
[1:13:06] the very thing that he broke up
[1:13:10] because the form wasn't wrong
[1:13:13] the ritual wasn't wrong the worship
[1:13:16] wasn't wrong
[1:13:17] their heart was wrong
[1:13:21] and the very thing that got broken
[1:13:24] so that they could get scattered when he
[1:13:26] brings them back he'll have them build
[1:13:28] back the very thing that he destroyed
[1:13:35] praise our god joel chapter 2
[1:13:41] verse 23
[1:13:45] be glad then ye children of zion and
[1:13:47] rejoice in the lord your god
[1:13:49] for he hath given you the former rain
[1:13:51] moderately and he will cause to come
[1:13:53] down for you the rain
[1:13:54] the former rain and the latter rain in
[1:13:56] the first month
[1:13:58] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[1:14:01] the
[1:14:01] vats shall be overflowing with wine and
[1:14:04] oil and i will restore to you the years
[1:14:06] that the locusts had eaten the
[1:14:07] cankerworm the caterpillar
[1:14:09] the palmer worm my great army
[1:14:13] whose army god's army
[1:14:16] brother brenham uses this and he
[1:14:19] preached when he preaches he uses this
[1:14:20] verse
[1:14:21] to preach the restoration of the bride
[1:14:22] tree that this
[1:14:24] is god's army that he allowed to eat the
[1:14:27] fruit
[1:14:28] to eat the leaves fellowship to eat the
[1:14:31] bark
[1:14:32] doctrine to suck the sap which was the
[1:14:34] life why
[1:14:35] because he broke that thing and let it
[1:14:37] go captive because he already
[1:14:38] foreshadowed it in the old testament
[1:14:40] now it's living out in the new testament
[1:14:42] so that he can bring a people back
[1:14:44] and the people who come back are not
[1:14:45] going to fall by the same way when they
[1:14:47] went in
[1:14:47] they're coming back with a heart for god
[1:14:49] and they want god and god only
[1:14:59] i will restore how is he going to
[1:15:02] restore
[1:15:03] he's going to bring the former and
[1:15:05] latter rain together
[1:15:07] the former rain is the teaching reign
[1:15:10] the in the
[1:15:10] in the seventh church age messenger
[1:15:13] brought back the teaching the doctrine
[1:15:15] restored to the church
[1:15:16] all the loose ends that was left out
[1:15:18] over seven church ages the former reign
[1:15:20] brought it all back together
[1:15:22] then he's going to send the latter rain
[1:15:23] or the harvest rain the final rain
[1:15:25] before the harvest
[1:15:26] and that fell at the opening of the
[1:15:28] seals
[1:15:30] and what's he doing he's bringing the
[1:15:31] former and latter rain together in the
[1:15:33] first month
[1:15:35] why because when this happens you go
[1:15:37] back to the beginning you go back to one
[1:15:39] you go back to what the church was meant
[1:15:41] to be in the very beginning of pentecost
[1:15:45] now the former atlanta reign falls
[1:15:47] together and in that day
[1:15:49] i will restore all that the palmer worm
[1:15:51] all the cankerworm all that the locust
[1:15:54] palmer wore my great army which i sent
[1:15:56] among you and you shall eaten plenty
[1:15:59] what kind of eaties eating is he talking
[1:16:01] about he's talking about the kind of
[1:16:02] eating we're doing here tonight friends
[1:16:04] he's being fed from the manna from
[1:16:06] heaven fed from the word of god
[1:16:08] and you shall eaten plenty and be
[1:16:10] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:16:11] lord your god
[1:16:12] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[1:16:15] my people shall never be ashamed
[1:16:17] and you shall know that i am in the
[1:16:19] midst of israel and that i am the lord
[1:16:21] your god
[1:16:22] and none else and my people shall never
[1:16:24] be
[1:16:25] ashamed that day
[1:16:28] is this day amen he has restored he has
[1:16:32] brought the former and latter reign to
[1:16:34] bring back amen all that was lost
[1:16:36] through the church ages and all
[1:16:38] that we had been separated from and all
[1:16:39] that was broken and all the word that
[1:16:41] was lost
[1:16:44] he's restored that full word again
[1:16:48] why because he wants us to have a
[1:16:50] relationship
[1:16:51] with him not with the commandment
[1:16:55] with him he's the giver of the
[1:16:58] commandment
[1:17:00] he doesn't want us to follow the ritual
[1:17:02] he wants us to seek after
[1:17:04] him he wants us to do what he said do
[1:17:11] it's not that he says no there's no
[1:17:12] point coming to church now brother chad
[1:17:16] that's not the point the point is this
[1:17:19] time around when he rebuilds that
[1:17:21] tabernacle
[1:17:22] and he sets the incense in place and he
[1:17:24] sets the priesthood in place
[1:17:25] and he says the sacrifice in place and
[1:17:27] the feast of new moons and the daily
[1:17:29] oblation
[1:17:29] now everything they do was a full
[1:17:31] feeling
[1:17:33] now they now they wake up in the morning
[1:17:36] and all of a sudden
[1:17:37] that morning oblation goes up and they
[1:17:39] all look out of their tents
[1:17:40] towards towards the mount moriah and
[1:17:42] they see the wisp of smoke going up
[1:17:43] because the priest is offering the
[1:17:44] morning oblation
[1:17:46] and every one of them with tears in
[1:17:47] their eyes say thank god he's restored
[1:17:49] us
[1:17:50] it's no longer a tradition it was the
[1:17:52] same act but it was all different amen
[1:17:55] it's the same kind of church gathering
[1:17:57] the same kind of people
[1:17:58] the same kind of pre-service and songs
[1:18:00] and a preaching and a closing but it's
[1:18:02] all different now
[1:18:05] amen the same kind of daily devotion the
[1:18:07] same kind of devotions with your family
[1:18:09] the same kind of morning prayer and
[1:18:10] evening prayers it's the same
[1:18:12] kind of thing but it's all different now
[1:18:14] friends
[1:18:18] because god wanted it that way he had to
[1:18:22] break it
[1:18:23] so that he could scatter
[1:18:26] and at the end of the church ages he
[1:18:28] could bring us back
[1:18:31] and that he would have a people that
[1:18:34] would seek for him
[1:18:36] with all of their heart
[1:18:39] this time he's going to have a people
[1:18:43] that won't make the service of god
[1:18:46] a family tradition they won't make it a
[1:18:50] traditional thing a ritualistic thing
[1:18:52] with no feeling
[1:18:53] but everything god said do they said
[1:18:55] i'll do it
[1:18:57] but i'll do it with a full heart

[1:21:06] i can't do it on my own i can't do it by
[1:21:09] myself
[1:21:10] but just as sure as you said through
[1:21:13] jeremiah
[1:21:14] that you will have a people and they
[1:21:16] will be found of you they will seek you
[1:21:18] with all their heart
[1:21:20] they will call and you will hear this is
[1:21:22] sure is that prophecy
[1:21:24] you've prophesied that you'll have a
[1:21:25] bride without spot or wrinkle at the end
[1:21:28] and i'm trusting in that prophecy i'm
[1:21:31] trusting in what you told us through the
[1:21:33] prophet
[1:21:33] i can't do it myself but i believe i'm
[1:21:35] one of them
[1:21:39] and may god i approach everything i do
[1:21:43] with that revelation with that heart
[1:21:48] can we read one more scripture let's go
[1:21:51] to psalms 137
[1:21:52] musicians if you'll come brother ben if
[1:21:54] you'll make your way up
[1:21:57] psalms 137
[1:22:02] i don't know why i can't get this
[1:22:04] scripture off my mind
[1:22:06] i didn't put in my notes and i said i
[1:22:08] wasn't going to preach on it
[1:22:10] but i can't get it off my heart psalms
[1:22:13] 137
[1:22:14] verse 1 by the rivers of babylon
[1:22:18] there we sat down yea we wept when we
[1:22:20] remembered zion
[1:22:22] zion is the bride
[1:22:26] we hanged our harps upon the willows in
[1:22:28] the midst thereof
[1:22:30] for there they that carried us away
[1:22:32] captive required of us a song
[1:22:35] and that they that wasted us required of
[1:22:37] us mirth saying sing us one of the songs
[1:22:39] of zion
[1:22:40] listen friends listen put your spiritual
[1:22:44] jacket on amen
[1:22:45] amen we were carried away into babylon
[1:22:48] into this babylonian religion into this
[1:22:50] denominational system we were carried
[1:22:52] away into it
[1:22:54] and we didn't mourn and weep when we
[1:22:55] thought about what the bride was meant
[1:22:57] to be what she was supposed to be versus
[1:22:59] what she is
[1:22:59] in this denominational debauchery
[1:23:03] and we begin to weep amen and we took
[1:23:06] our harp
[1:23:07] we couldn't even sing the songs of zion
[1:23:09] with joy anymore because
[1:23:10] everything was in ruin we hung our harp
[1:23:13] on the willows
[1:23:13] but those that had taken us captive
[1:23:16] under the and the heartless
[1:23:17] they demanded of us a song
[1:23:23] how can i sing when the bride's out of
[1:23:26] place
[1:23:27] how can i sing when the brides in room
[1:23:29] in jerusalem and zions
[1:23:31] how can i sing but they demanded of us a
[1:23:33] song
[1:23:35] oh praise god and they that wasted us
[1:23:38] required of us
[1:23:39] mirth saying sing us one of the songs of
[1:23:42] zion
[1:23:43] how shall we sing the lord's song in a
[1:23:46] strange
[1:23:46] land if i forget the old jerusalem let
[1:23:51] my right hand forget her cunning
[1:23:52] if i do not remember thee let my tongue
[1:23:54] cleave to the roof of my mouth
[1:23:56] if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief
[1:24:00] joy god was accomplishing his purpose
[1:24:05] when they were separated
[1:24:08] and god was accomplishing his purpose
[1:24:11] through this denominational system when
[1:24:12] he had us separated
[1:24:14] from what the bride was supposed to be
[1:24:18] we hung our harp on the willows
[1:24:22] how can i sing the songs of zion
[1:24:26] when i'm separated from what i'm
[1:24:28] supposed to be
[1:24:31] but god sent a prophet in this day to
[1:24:34] show us the way back
[1:24:36] to bring back and return our captivity
[1:24:38] to come back to zion
[1:24:40] to come back to the church that she was
[1:24:42] meant to be at pentecost
[1:24:43] to come back to be the bride that he had
[1:24:46] four
[1:24:46] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:24:48] world when his heart's purpose was to
[1:24:50] have a bride of his own choosing
[1:24:52] now he's brought her out of captivity
[1:24:54] he's brought her out of babylon
[1:24:56] out of the denominations out of their
[1:24:57] own thinking out of traditionalism out
[1:24:59] of formalism
[1:25:00] and brought them back and i say it's
[1:25:03] time to take our harps down and sing a
[1:25:05] song amen
[1:25:06] to rejoice and sing with a full heart
[1:25:09] amen
[1:25:09] not because they required of us a song
[1:25:11] not because they require within earth
[1:25:13] but we're back in zion friends
[1:25:17] it's time to sing to rejoice
[1:25:20] to make our heart connected with what
[1:25:22] we're saying amen
[1:25:23] to let our heart connect with what's
[1:25:25] being preached connect with what the
[1:25:27] prophet said
[1:25:28] amen connect with our bridegroom
[1:25:33] what a day we live in friends there's no
[1:25:36] day for formalism no day for tradition
[1:25:38] this is the day for the reality of all
[1:25:41] things
[1:25:42] zion has come back amen he's brought her
[1:25:46] out of her captivity he's washed her
[1:25:48] with clean water
[1:25:49] he sprinkled her he set her in place
[1:25:53] now he's whispering love secrets in her
[1:25:55] ear
[1:25:56] and she's singing with mirth and joy and
[1:25:59] gladness
[1:26:01] and thanksgiving
[1:26:04] he broke the system to scatter the elect
[1:26:09] to bring them back so that we won't
[1:26:12] repeat the process
[1:26:14] let's not let formalism creep around us
[1:26:17] friends let's be guarded against
[1:26:18] it he peeled the seals back so we could
[1:26:22] see what that spirit was
[1:26:24] and how that spirit operated so that we
[1:26:26] wouldn't fall prey to the same spirit
[1:26:30] this is not the day to repeat the
[1:26:33] process this is the day to go free amen
[1:26:36] this is the day you prophesied let's all
[1:26:38] stand
[1:26:40] and when we sing let's sing with mirth
[1:26:43] and joy in our heart
[1:26:46] for there's never been a day like this
[1:26:49] day
[1:26:51] man brother ben you got a song brother
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:17] make me more likely
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:27] break
[1:27:29] and bless
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:40] let me be
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:58] by the fire of your spirit
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:11] and make
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:23] and bless the broken
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] let me be
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:46] how many of you happy that he broke the
[1:28:48] system
[1:28:50] and he exposed it through a prophet in
[1:28:52] this day that exposed it like isaiah
[1:28:54] didn't like jeremiah did
[1:28:56] and explained to us what happened so
[1:28:58] that we wouldn't repeat i'm so glad he
[1:29:00] broke the system
[1:29:02] i'd like to say many many here
[1:29:05] many have been through all kinds of
[1:29:08] different trials and
[1:29:10] church fellowships and things that have
[1:29:12] broke up and
[1:29:13] maybe even family situations that have
[1:29:15] broke up or friendship
[1:29:16] and you wonder why did that ever happen
[1:29:19] it might have been for your good
[1:29:21] right it just might have been
[1:29:24] to free us so that we wouldn't get
[1:29:27] caught in something that
[1:29:28] that would become a tradition or a habit
[1:29:30] or a ritual
[1:29:33] and many things have happened and
[1:29:35] disappointing and discouraging things
[1:29:37] and
[1:29:38] many things we thought would last
[1:29:39] forever are broken
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:43] but it's not like god hasn't worked like
[1:29:44] that before
[1:29:47] people we love broken and separated from
[1:29:51] zion
[1:29:53] maybe that's for their good
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:56] maybe we would look at what happened to
[1:29:59] israel
[1:30:00] as they get carried away captive babylon
[1:30:02] say oh that's bad but god said i did it
[1:30:04] for their good
[1:30:06] they said it's bad but if you knew the
[1:30:08] prophecy you'd say it's good
[1:30:11] many times there's loved ones and young
[1:30:13] people and other ones that
[1:30:15] that have gotten carried away
[1:30:18] been broken away and separated away
[1:30:22] oh if we just knew the predestinated
[1:30:24] plan of god
[1:30:26] if we could just see what he's already
[1:30:28] prophesied over them
[1:30:30] if we could see the plan that he had to
[1:30:33] give them a heart that would cry unto
[1:30:35] him
[1:30:37] maybe that was the only way and if that
[1:30:40] was the only way
[1:30:41] then that's the perfect way
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:46] i'm sure that day in jerusalem when
[1:30:49] they were all being gathered up on ox
[1:30:51] carts and whatever else and forced to
[1:30:53] walk and
[1:30:54] being led away i'm sure they all felt
[1:30:56] like it was a bad day
[1:30:59] but oh if they just believe the prophecy
[1:31:03] they would know that all things work
[1:31:05] together for good
[1:31:07] that it's good when we look back and we
[1:31:11] look on the relationships that are
[1:31:12] broken up and the
[1:31:13] fellowships of believers that were
[1:31:15] broken up and the movements and the
[1:31:16] church systems and the
[1:31:18] whatever else families you know what
[1:31:21] let's just say
[1:31:22] it had to be that way so that i would
[1:31:25] have a heart that was connected only to
[1:31:27] him
[1:31:29] so that i would call and he would answer
[1:31:32] he had a plan of good and not evil to
[1:31:35] bring me to an expected end
[1:31:37] and if all of that was required to get
[1:31:39] my heart dialed into him to on the same
[1:31:41] frequency
[1:31:42] where i would love him and him only then
[1:31:44] i say thank you lord
[1:31:46] it's what i needed
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:50] god breaks so that he can free
[1:31:54] and he brings back together with a
[1:31:56] prophecy
[1:31:57] it'll be different this time and that's
[1:32:00] the age that we live in friends the end
[1:32:03] of all cycles the
[1:32:04] end of this cycle he's coming back for a
[1:32:07] permanent
[1:32:08] healing i thank god for that
[1:32:13] are you glad that he's freed you
[1:32:16] let's rejoice in our freedom this is bow
[1:32:19] our heads and praise we
[1:32:21] dismiss lord jesus we thank you father

[1:33:12] a family tradition
