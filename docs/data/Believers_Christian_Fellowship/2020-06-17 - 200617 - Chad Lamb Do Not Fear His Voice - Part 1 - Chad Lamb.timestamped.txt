[0:54] it's chains that were holding
[1:01] [Music]
[1:10] again is restored to me because the
[1:14] truth is revealed
[1:17] he's opened the season
[1:26] [Music]
[1:32] there's never been a day
[1:36] like this
[1:40] [Music]
[1:44] [Applause]
[1:52] there's never been a light
[1:57] that shines so
[2:01] bright as this day
[2:05] this glory
[2:13] [Music]
[2:21] jesus christ
[2:38] [Music]
[2:48] my
[2:51] lord
[2:56] even so
[3:05] [Music]
[3:15] let's just sing the song as brother chad
[3:17] comes where he leads me
[3:18] you know he can he can come for us but
[3:20] we have to follow him
[3:32] [Music]
[3:39] behind we'll follow
[3:46] [Music]
[3:59] i'll go with him
[4:03] with him
[4:07] all the way
[4:10] where he leads me
[4:14] and where he lives
[4:35] [Music]
[4:37] where he leads
[4:48] [Music]
[4:54] with
[5:02] praise the lord man we'll go with him
[5:06] because we're predestinated to not
[5:09] because of
[5:10] our willpower or the strength in our
[5:12] resolve
[5:13] but the only way we're going to go with
[5:14] him all the way is because he determined
[5:16] before the foundation of the world
[5:18] that this bride won't fall she's
[5:21] predestinated not to
[5:23] all praise be to god and then while
[5:26] we're standing let's
[5:27] turn to the book of exodus and we'll go
[5:29] straight to the word
[5:30] exodus 34. i'll return there i just want
[5:33] to let you know that the new missions
[5:35] newsletter is out and available
[5:37] we've got it printed and it should be on
[5:38] the welcome desk and in the hallway
[5:41] so if you want to grab one of those
[5:44] that'd be great
[5:45] also want to thank brother kyle for last
[5:48] wednesday and brother ben for this past
[5:50] sunday they were wonderful services
[5:52] i enjoyed sitting in the service and
[5:54] feeding on the word so
[5:56] we're very privileged i'm very
[5:57] privileged to be able to
[5:59] sit and enjoy just like everybody else
[6:00] amen so we thank them for that
[6:04] let's look here at exodus 34 we're going
[6:06] to kind of pick up some things we talked
[6:07] about last time and move from there
[6:10] exodus 34 verse 1
[6:14] and the lord said unto moses
[6:17] hew thee two tables of stone like unto
[6:19] the first and i will write upon these
[6:21] tables the words
[6:22] that were in the first tables which thou
[6:24] breakest
[6:25] and be ready in the morning and come up
[6:27] in the morning unto mount sinai and
[6:29] present thyself there to me in the top
[6:30] of the mountain
[6:32] and no man shall come up with thee
[6:33] neither let any man be seen throughout
[6:35] all the mount
[6:36] neither let the flock nor the herds feed
[6:38] before the mount
[6:40] and he hewed two tables of stone like
[6:41] unto the first and moses rose up early
[6:43] in the morning and
[6:44] went up into the mount sinai as the lord
[6:46] had commanded him
[6:48] and took in his hand the two tables of
[6:50] stone
[6:51] and the lord descended in the cloud and
[6:54] stood with him there and proclaimed
[6:56] the name of the lord man let's just pray
[6:59] lord jesus we just ask god that you
[7:01] would feed us on your word
[7:03] lord as we've come tonight lord to sing
[7:05] your praises to worship your name
[7:08] god we do so with a heart of joy lord
[7:10] and gratitude for all you've given to us
[7:13] all that you're speaking to us in this
[7:15] hour lord to awaken something inside
[7:18] to a greater realization lord a
[7:20] realization of
[7:22] a truth that we knew before the
[7:23] foundation of the world
[7:25] you're bringing us back to that truth
[7:27] lord we just pray tonight lord that you
[7:29] would move all carnality out of the way
[7:32] all flesh lord let it be laid aside and
[7:35] may you come and speak lord in the way
[7:37] that you provided
[7:38] god that you would speak your word and
[7:40] and draw us nearer to you
[7:42] we ask you to break the bread of life
[7:44] for us tonight
[7:45] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[7:49] you can all be seated so we find moses
[7:52] goes up
[7:53] unto the mountain because god had given
[7:56] him
[7:57] two tables of stone where god had
[7:59] written cut the stone out of the
[8:00] mountain
[8:01] and he had written on the stone and and
[8:03] as moses is walking down
[8:05] he finds that uh israel had already
[8:08] slipped into idolatry and
[8:09] he broke the tables of stone because
[8:11] this is exactly what is going to happen
[8:13] in the beginning of the church ages
[8:15] because the word is going to come
[8:17] through a prophet through a messenger
[8:19] through through the apostle paul
[8:21] amen and right in the first church age
[8:23] they're going to slip into idolatry and
[8:25] the word is going to be
[8:26] fragmented and broken through seven
[8:28] church ages
[8:29] but at the end of seven church ages
[8:31] there's going to be a revelation
[8:33] that there's a white stone with nothing
[8:35] written on it amen so
[8:37] the prophet of god is going to go to
[8:38] mount sunset amen with the revelation of
[8:41] a white stone
[8:42] unwritten stone nothing written on the
[8:44] stone in his heart
[8:46] and he's going to get caught up into the
[8:47] constellation of seven angels to go back
[8:50] amen to find out what is the
[8:52] interpretation of the unwritten word
[8:55] amen
[8:56] and so now we see the same thing played
[8:58] out in moses amen and it's interesting
[9:01] everything that is has been before there
[9:03] is nothing new under the sun
[9:04] i mean the things they're going through
[9:06] now were there and and and all of that
[9:08] and i would even venture to say this is
[9:10] just me i don't have the authority to
[9:12] say but this is just the way i think
[9:15] everything that we're seeing amen right
[9:17] in genesis and exodus we see it again
[9:20] amen but but i don't know if that's the
[9:23] first time it's played out in genesis
[9:25] maybe the first time it played out was
[9:26] in heaven
[9:27] through a great battle and a falling
[9:29] away and to to a kingdom divided amen
[9:32] and then it spills down
[9:33] so everything that we see has been
[9:35] before all the way back
[9:38] because it's an old battle that started
[9:40] in heaven amen way back
[9:41] and it continues on and what started his
[9:43] angels has now fallen into human beings
[9:46] and so now we're here continuing on the
[9:48] same thing that's been
[9:50] so when we look back at this with eyes
[9:52] of understanding god
[9:54] taking the scale off of our eyes we can
[9:56] now begin to see
[9:57] amen he laid down patterns and those
[9:59] patterns continue
[10:01] and so now moses is going to the
[10:03] mountain the first word has been lost
[10:05] amen but now he's coming back to a
[10:07] mountain
[10:08] amen to get the writing for the for the
[10:11] unwritten word the stones with no
[10:13] writing on them
[10:15] praise be to god so we find out that god
[10:18] gives him that interpretation and
[10:19] actually commands him to write on the
[10:21] stone
[10:22] because the sword was given into the
[10:24] prophet's hand amen so he could carve
[10:26] out of the rock of revelation the hidden
[10:30] mystery that was contained in the bible
[10:32] amen praise god did we really think that
[10:36] was new
[10:37] when that happened when a sharp tool
[10:39] struck his hand and he peeled the top
[10:41] off revealing
[10:42] a stone with nothing written on it
[10:44] because moses had to take a sharp tool
[10:46] and cut out two tables of stone
[10:48] to restore the word and go into the
[10:50] mountain so god could give him the word
[10:52] amen because god says i'll write on
[10:54] those stones
[10:56] but but the prophet of god goes in
[10:59] january 1963 and sabino kenny's holding
[11:01] up his hand
[11:02] and a sword hits his hand and it's the
[11:05] sword
[11:05] of the lord and he said the lord only
[11:07] has one sword and that's his word
[11:09] amen so he takes a sharp instrument to
[11:12] cut
[11:12] out of that stone the interpretation of
[11:15] the unwritten word
[11:18] praise god amen first time we heard that
[11:20] we thought
[11:21] that's new where's that in the bible
[11:23] it's right here
[11:24] in moses but when the scale falls off of
[11:27] the eyes then we can see it
[11:29] everything brother branham did was
[11:31] scriptural
[11:32] it wasn't new this is scriptural this
[11:34] has been done before
[11:36] we just have to have eyes to see
[11:39] so now we look in verse five and it said
[11:40] and the lord descended in the cloud and
[11:42] stood with him there
[11:44] and proclaimed the name of the lord amen
[11:47] but he proclaimed the name of the lord
[11:50] but he didn't come down off of that
[11:52] mountain with a new spelling for a new
[11:54] name
[11:55] so to proclaim the name of the lord may
[11:58] be different than what we think
[12:00] brother brahm said in the message is
[12:03] this the sign of the answer
[12:05] he said when the world is so confused
[12:07] and do not know where they are
[12:08] standing we are glad that the name of
[12:10] the lord is a mighty tower
[12:12] and the righteous run into it and are
[12:14] safe
[12:16] just not so many words but a revelation
[12:20] just not words just not spelling but a
[12:22] revelation
[12:24] because the name of the lord is a strong
[12:26] tower that the righteous run into
[12:28] it's not like you can take and and do
[12:31] paper mache
[12:32] uh a carving of the name jesus and climb
[12:35] inside the name
[12:38] it's the revelation of who that person
[12:40] is in this day
[12:42] is the strong tower that the righteous
[12:43] run into amen not who jesus was but who
[12:46] jesus
[12:47] is is the revelation of his name
[12:50] and it is the strong tower that the
[12:52] righteous run into
[12:54] and are saved not just so many words but
[12:56] a revelation
[12:57] he goes on to saying god's only provided
[12:59] place of worship
[13:01] so then the name is the word because he
[13:03] is the word
[13:05] amen what is he then the word
[13:08] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[13:10] name of god
[13:12] the word interpret is the manifestation
[13:14] of the name of god
[13:16] and he didn't change the english
[13:18] spelling
[13:21] not a new name but a further revelation
[13:24] of who that person is that carries that
[13:27] name
[13:28] the word interpret is the manifestation
[13:30] of the name of god
[13:32] no wonder flesh and blood has not
[13:33] revealed this to you but my father which
[13:35] is in heaven
[13:36] has revealed this to you who i am
[13:39] and upon this rock i'll build my place
[13:42] of worship
[13:43] and the gates of hell can't shake it
[13:45] down
[13:46] man so it's important to know that name
[13:50] but there's billions who know that the
[13:53] name
[13:54] jesus christ amen and evoke that name
[13:57] jesus christ but if we do so without the
[14:00] knowledge of who he
[14:02] is today it doesn't bring the same
[14:05] strength that's not the same strong
[14:07] tower
[14:08] in fact there's much deception going out
[14:11] among the land
[14:12] in that name so how do you know if what
[14:15] you're receiving
[14:16] in that name is a tower of deception or
[14:19] a strong tower for the day of battle
[14:21] amen you only know by the revelation of
[14:23] who that person
[14:24] is now and only that revelation amen
[14:28] will
[14:28] will cut away all deception
[14:31] so there's billions millions being
[14:33] deceived in the name of jesus
[14:36] but there's an elect group who's caught
[14:38] the manifestation the word interpreted
[14:40] is the manifestation of the name of god
[14:42] and they've caught it and to them it's a
[14:44] strong tower
[14:46] and now they have his name man let's
[14:49] look at exodus 34
[14:52] 29. i'm gonna move on a little bit
[15:02] 29 exodus 34 and 29 and it came to pass
[15:06] when moses came down from mount sinai
[15:08] with the two tables of testimony
[15:10] in moses hand when he came down from the
[15:12] mount
[15:13] that moses was not that the skin of his
[15:15] face shone
[15:16] while he talked with him and when aaron
[15:19] and all the children of israel saw moses
[15:21] behold the skin of his face shone
[15:23] and they were afraid to come nigh unto
[15:25] him and moses called unto them and aaron
[15:27] and all the rulers of
[15:29] of the congregation returned unto him
[15:31] and moses talked with them
[15:33] and afterward all the children of israel
[15:35] came nigh and gave
[15:37] and he gave them in commandment all that
[15:40] the lord had spoken with him in mount
[15:42] sinai
[15:43] until moses had done speaking with them
[15:45] he put a veil on his face
[15:47] but when moses went in before the lord
[15:49] to speak with him
[15:50] he took the veil off until he came out
[15:53] and he came out
[15:54] and spake unto the children of israel
[15:56] that which he was commanded
[15:57] and the children of israel saw the face
[15:59] of moses and the skin of moses face
[16:01] shone
[16:01] and moses put the veil upon his face
[16:04] again until he went in to speak with him
[16:07] so now we find this is a interesting and
[16:10] i want to elaborate on this
[16:12] a little bit but moses he goes and
[16:14] receives the word of god
[16:16] and he goes upon the mount amen and up
[16:18] upon the mount he receives a revelation
[16:21] from god himself
[16:22] and when he comes down he doesn't even
[16:24] realize he's shining his face is shining
[16:26] so bright
[16:27] that it's scaring amen the rest of the
[16:30] congregation
[16:31] until he has to veil his face
[16:35] uh now we realize the illumination by
[16:38] revelation is
[16:39] a scary thing
[16:42] to those who haven't caught the
[16:44] revelation
[16:46] we see it all the way back amen what
[16:48] we're going through now
[16:49] is nothing new it has been before and
[16:52] when moses comes down off the mount
[16:54] and what did he receive the true word of
[16:56] god the true revelation of god the
[16:58] judgments and commandments of god
[17:00] and he came down because now he carries
[17:03] carrying
[17:04] the word and the word is the light of
[17:06] the lord
[17:08] and when he's carrying the word now he's
[17:11] a word bearer
[17:12] and with the word bearer now he's a
[17:14] light emanator
[17:15] amen in the lightest show bright shining
[17:17] off of his face
[17:18] and brother remember said off his face
[17:20] because the words were coming out of his
[17:22] mouth
[17:22] amen shining out of his face that it was
[17:24] frightening to the congregation
[17:28] oh praise be to god amen and today
[17:31] amen the revelation of the mystery
[17:33] that's being revealed right now on his
[17:35] bride
[17:36] can be frightening amen to the rest of
[17:38] the congregation
[17:39] until they catch the mystery themselves
[17:44] praise be to god so moses did him a
[17:48] favor and covered his face with the veil
[17:52] let's go to second corinthians
[17:57] second corinthians and we're going to
[17:58] come back to exodus but let's go to
[18:00] second corinthians
[18:04] chapter 3.
[18:13] second corinthians chapter 3
[18:17] and verse 12. now now you'll see
[18:20] friends if you've if you've ever been on
[18:24] that
[18:24] mountaintop yourself
[18:28] and caught the revelation from god
[18:30] himself
[18:32] now you know why some people that you
[18:34] were friends with
[18:36] begin to run away from you when you come
[18:38] down from the mountain
[18:40] because even moses brother aaron was
[18:42] afraid of him
[18:44] even his family and his friends the rest
[18:47] of the congregation had no problem with
[18:48] moses
[18:49] amen until moses had been on the
[18:51] mountain caught the revelation and when
[18:52] he come down the revelation
[18:54] the light that was coming from him was
[18:56] so bright amen that they stood afar off
[18:58] they were afraid of him
[19:01] now we understand praise god
[19:06] second corinthians 3 verse 12.
[19:11] seeing seeing then that we have such
[19:13] hope we use great plainness of speech
[19:16] and not as moses which put a veil over
[19:18] his face that the children of israel
[19:19] could not steadfastly look to the end
[19:21] of that which is abolished but their
[19:23] minds were blinded for until this day
[19:25] remain at the same veil untaken away
[19:28] in the reading of the old testament
[19:30] which veil is done away
[19:31] in christ but even unto this day when
[19:34] moses is read the veil is upon their
[19:36] heart
[19:37] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[19:39] lord the veil shall be taken away
[19:42] now the lord is that spirit and where
[19:44] the spirit of the lord is there is
[19:45] liberty
[19:46] but we all with open face beholding as
[19:49] in the glass the glory of the lord
[19:51] are changed into the same image from
[19:53] glory to glory
[19:55] even as by the spirit of the lord so now
[19:58] moses wearing a veil was very symbolic
[20:02] because moses came down and he gave
[20:05] commandments it gave
[20:06] he gave verbal dialogue and he even
[20:08] wrote the commandments and the judgments
[20:10] in a book and even had two tables of
[20:12] stone
[20:13] and they they coming down would receive
[20:16] the written word now catch this closely
[20:20] they would receive the written word they
[20:22] would receive
[20:23] the words that that he spoke and they
[20:26] would receive the words that were
[20:28] written down
[20:29] and the words that were chiseled in the
[20:30] stone but because
[20:32] they hadn't been on the mountain
[20:34] themselves and gotten it from god they
[20:36] got it second
[20:37] hand and when it came second hand
[20:40] moses had it firsthand and firsthand he
[20:43] was the illumination
[20:45] but when it came secondhand into their
[20:47] hands now the veil
[20:49] moved from moses face to their heart
[20:52] because now the word couldn't come into
[20:54] the heart because they didn't go to the
[20:56] mountain themselves and get the word
[20:58] they were trying to get the word second
[21:00] hand
[21:03] this is really important because what is
[21:05] the new birth brother branham
[21:07] it's jesus christ revealed personally
[21:10] to you amen matthew 16
[21:13] who do men say that i am some say this
[21:16] and say who do you
[21:17] say that i am he said thou art christ
[21:19] the son of the living god
[21:20] said blessed art thou because flesh and
[21:23] blood hath not revealed to you you did
[21:25] not get this revelation
[21:26] second hand because somebody said it and
[21:29] you could read it
[21:30] and you nodded your head in agreement
[21:32] amen that will put a veil
[21:34] over your heart
[21:37] if it happened in exodus it'll happen
[21:40] today being able to open a message book
[21:44] and read a message book and not our head
[21:46] does not mean that there's not a veil on
[21:48] our heart
[21:50] amen how do we get the veil off of our
[21:53] heart
[21:54] listen this is what he said he said
[21:57] verse 14 but their minds were blinded
[21:59] for unto this day remain at the same
[22:01] veil
[22:01] untaken away in the reading of the old
[22:03] testament which
[22:04] veil is done away in christ
[22:08] how do i get the veil removed when i get
[22:10] in christ
[22:11] amen by a revelation and a new birth
[22:14] amen then the veil is taken away
[22:16] and now it's not secondhand revelation
[22:19] it is direct because now i've united
[22:21] with christ
[22:22] i'm a part of him i'm in him and the
[22:25] revelations come direct
[22:26] to rent the veil of my heart amen so
[22:29] that
[22:30] now i can see
[22:35] oh there's nothing new under the sun
[22:38] what has been
[22:39] is again so now
[22:44] verse 15 but even unto this day when
[22:46] moses read the veil is upon their heart
[22:48] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[22:50] lord the veil shall be taken away
[22:53] now the lord is that spirit and where
[22:54] the spirit of the lord is there is
[22:56] liberty or freedom but we all with open
[23:01] face
[23:02] we all with open face what's he saying
[23:04] we have come into christ
[23:06] the veil is off of our heart the veil is
[23:08] off of our face
[23:09] now with the unveiled face amen
[23:12] we're looking directly amen not second
[23:14] hand
[23:15] amen not looking we're not looking at
[23:18] print on paper we're looking at jesus
[23:20] christ himself
[23:21] with an open face face to face with him
[23:26] praise be to god now we all with open
[23:29] face be holding
[23:30] as in a glass as in a mirror
[23:36] as in the glass the glory of the lord
[23:38] are changed into the same image
[23:40] from glory to glory even by the spirit
[23:42] of the lord
[23:44] so now i mean this gets more and more
[23:46] interesting all the time
[23:47] so now with an unveiled face because
[23:49] i've united
[23:50] christ whatever i'm looking at in the uh
[23:53] with an unveiled face
[23:55] with a revelation that comes from god
[23:57] i'm being changed into that image and if
[23:59] i'm looking at christ
[24:00] i'm being changed into christ from glory
[24:04] unto glory unto glory i'm being changed
[24:08] into the image of the thing i'm looking
[24:10] at with an
[24:10] unveiled face because the veil has been
[24:12] taken away
[24:13] by a revelation that came from the
[24:15] father himself
[24:16] to remove the veil off of my face to
[24:18] remove the veil off of my heart
[24:20] and whatever i see with an unveiled face
[24:23] is what i
[24:24] am becoming
[24:27] but you cannot become christ with a
[24:30] veiled face
[24:34] praise god it doesn't matter
[24:40] i'm going to go slow it doesn't matter
[24:46] how much we repeat the phrases
[24:51] this is really important repeating the
[24:55] phrases
[24:56] will not take the veil away because
[24:59] through all the
[25:00] old testament the priests were repeating
[25:02] the phrases
[25:03] and all the ceremonial worship and all
[25:06] the reading of the law
[25:07] they were repeating the phrases but
[25:09] repeating the phrases
[25:11] didn't take the veil away they had to
[25:14] come into christ
[25:15] and when they came into christ it took
[25:17] the veil then is rent it's removed
[25:20] it's parted
[25:25] it's not new words
[25:29] this is what's interesting when the veil
[25:31] was taken away
[25:35] the apostle paul is on a journey to
[25:38] damascus
[25:40] and the apostle paul is veiled to the
[25:42] truth
[25:44] when paul preaches this he knows what
[25:46] he's talking about because he had the
[25:47] veil on his heart
[25:50] he was persecuting christ amen christ
[25:53] spoke to him
[25:54] out of a pillar of fire and said saul
[25:56] saul why does thou
[25:58] kick against the priest he says
[26:01] he says who are you lord he said i'm
[26:03] jesus whom you persecute
[26:05] and he was persecuting the children of
[26:08] god he was persecuting the christians
[26:10] amen and they were christ they were
[26:12] jesus christ he was persecuting jesus
[26:14] christ
[26:15] because jesus christ was behind the veil
[26:17] of their flesh
[26:18] and he couldn't see behind the veil of
[26:20] flesh to find out who was there because
[26:22] he had a veil on his heart
[26:24] and because he had the veil in his heart
[26:25] he couldn't see what was behind the veil
[26:26] of their flesh
[26:29] but if god removes the veil off your
[26:31] heart you'll see what's behind the veil
[26:33] of flesh of your brother and sister
[26:36] so paul he's he's going down and he
[26:39] knows the words he knows the law
[26:41] he's read he can repeat he can probably
[26:45] quote verbatim the message
[26:49] but there's a veil on his heart and
[26:51] because there's a veil in his heart
[26:52] he'll persecute
[26:54] christ in flesh
[26:59] and when god gets a hold of paul amen
[27:02] and paul catches a revelation it's
[27:05] amazing
[27:06] the first thing that happens to paul is
[27:08] his natural eyesight
[27:09] goes black because paul
[27:13] was viewing the word through natural
[27:15] intellectual
[27:16] understanding so god symbolically
[27:19] smashes his natural ability to see
[27:25] you see the word is so perfect why did
[27:27] he smite him blind
[27:28] why did he have to smite him blind what
[27:30] was the point of smiting blind
[27:31] because he thought he could see and god
[27:33] had to say you can't see
[27:36] because his intellectual understanding
[27:38] was natural carnal
[27:39] understanding of words that were written
[27:41] and put in the book and copied by
[27:43] scribes
[27:44] so god smote him blind so he would see
[27:46] and told him that now
[27:48] you're going to be a light to the
[27:50] gentiles i'm going to send you forth to
[27:52] preach of the gentiles this is going to
[27:54] be your commission
[27:55] amen and now he against come not
[27:58] it wasn't agabus it was ananias i
[28:02] believe anyways you know who i'm talking
[28:03] about
[28:04] comes and he lays hands on him he
[28:05] receives the holy ghost scales for all
[28:07] of his eyes
[28:08] and now he can see and now it's not
[28:10] natural vision
[28:11] but now it's supernatural vision by
[28:14] revelation
[28:15] and he goes into the desert of arabia
[28:17] for three and a half years
[28:18] and is taught by christ the word
[28:21] now here's the amazing part paul with a
[28:24] veil over his heart
[28:25] cannot recognize christ in his day
[28:30] he cannot recognize the word he cannot
[28:32] see the fulfillment of prophecy
[28:34] he cannot even understand what moses
[28:36] wrote but as soon as god
[28:38] takes the scale off of his eyes not
[28:40] natural but the heart
[28:42] amen now he can teach him amen
[28:45] he can teach him the revelation of
[28:47] christ and how does
[28:48] jesus teach him the revelation of christ
[28:51] he takes him right back to the same
[28:53] books he's been reading
[28:54] all of his life and with the veil off of
[28:57] his heart
[28:57] he sees christ
[28:59] [Applause]
[29:01] and then paul goes from city to city
[29:05] going into the synagogue preaching
[29:07] christ
[29:08] from the scriptures the same
[29:12] scriptures he read that caused him to
[29:14] disbelieve
[29:15] now he reads the same scriptures that
[29:17] cause him to believe
[29:20] i just want to tell you friends the the
[29:22] message can be
[29:24] read the same exact way
[29:27] you can read quotes that cause you to
[29:30] disbelieve the revelation of christ in
[29:32] this day
[29:34] but when the veil is taken off of your
[29:36] heart you go back to the same quotes
[29:39] amen and now all of a sudden you you see
[29:41] the revelation of christ in your day
[29:44] because god did not give paul a new
[29:47] bible
[29:48] paul's bible became a new book amen
[29:53] oh this is why brother abraham said pray
[29:55] for revelation
[29:56] above everything else pray for
[29:58] revelation because the intellect's
[30:00] never going to get it amen years of
[30:02] service are never going to get it
[30:04] listening to it a thousand times is
[30:06] never going to get it amen if
[30:08] you're not in christ the veil is not
[30:10] taken away
[30:13] but in christ the veil is taken away and
[30:16] now the same tapes we've listened to
[30:18] become
[30:19] new tapes how many has experienced that
[30:23] the same books we read become new books
[30:25] the same bible becomes
[30:27] a new bible i don't read it the same way
[30:29] i've read it before
[30:30] now when i read it it's different but
[30:33] it's the same words
[30:36] why because the veil has to be taken
[30:37] away
[30:39] let's go back to exodus 19.
[30:42] let's take a look here at a couple
[30:45] things
[30:48] a lot of this is review i just wanted to
[30:50] slow down
[30:52] and catch up and review
[30:56] exodus 19 and 10.
[31:04] exodus 19 and 10 and the lord said unto
[31:07] moses
[31:07] go into the people and sanctify them
[31:09] today and tomorrow
[31:11] and let them wash their clothes and be
[31:12] ready against the third day
[31:14] for the third day the lord will come
[31:16] down in the sight of all the people
[31:18] upon mount sinai and thou shalt set
[31:20] bounds
[31:22] unto the people round about saying take
[31:24] heed to yourselves that you go not up
[31:26] into the mount or touch the border of it
[31:28] whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
[31:30] surely put to death
[31:32] there shall not be a hand touch it but
[31:34] he
[31:35] shall surely be stoned or shot through
[31:37] whether it be beast or man
[31:39] it shall not live when the trumpet
[31:41] soundeth long
[31:42] then shall thou come up to the mountain
[31:45] so
[31:46] now this is interesting we've talked
[31:48] about this before
[31:49] a couple years ago maybe but but he
[31:52] tells him don't come up to the mountain
[31:54] stay away from the mountain but when the
[31:57] trumpet soundeth long
[31:58] then come to the mountain and that long
[32:01] trumpet sound
[32:02] amen is going to be the voice of god
[32:04] speaking directly from heaven to the
[32:06] people
[32:06] and when they hear that trumpet sound
[32:08] long they're supposed to come up to the
[32:10] mountain
[32:12] let's keep your place in exodus let's go
[32:14] to deuteronomy 5.
[32:22] we're going to take our time here but
[32:23] there's a reason for it
[32:25] i trust i pray
[32:30] deuteronomy 5 verse 2
[32:34] the lord our god made a covenant with us
[32:36] in horeb horeb and sinai are the same
[32:38] place
[32:39] the lord made not this covenant with our
[32:41] fathers but with us even
[32:43] us who are all of us here alive this day
[32:46] the lord talked with you face to face in
[32:48] the mount out of the midst of the fire
[32:51] i stood between the lord and you at that
[32:53] time to show you the word of the lord
[32:55] for ye were afraid by reason of the fire
[32:57] and went
[32:58] not up into the mount
[33:01] now he's saying now god had sent
[33:05] a prophet to go gather his people out of
[33:07] bondage out of egypt
[33:09] out of the church ages and he sent a
[33:12] prophet to gather them
[33:13] out of bondage and for us the church
[33:16] ages represent
[33:17] bondage bondage by the chains
[33:20] of men's doctrines and creeds and their
[33:22] own intellectual ideas
[33:24] had bound the holy ghost if the holy
[33:26] ghost is bound friends you're bound
[33:28] [Music]
[33:30] because we can only do move breathe we
[33:32] can only do what we can do by the spirit
[33:34] of god and if the spirit of god is bound
[33:36] we're bound
[33:38] so this holy ghost was bound by the
[33:40] rivers of denomination and creeds and
[33:42] ideas of man and all of these factions
[33:45] amen so for us the denominations as our
[33:47] is our egypt is our bondage amen and god
[33:50] sent a prophet moses
[33:52] down to gather them through many signs
[33:54] and wonders to gather the people
[33:56] and bring them out of bondage to bring
[33:58] them to mount sinai
[33:59] and he was going to meet them on mount
[34:01] sinai and he was going to give them a
[34:03] marriage covenant and they were going to
[34:04] be united there
[34:07] why it was all about marriage he was
[34:10] sending
[34:10] eliezer to fetch a bride
[34:14] but he told her when you hear that
[34:17] trumpet sound long
[34:18] when you hear my voice amen when you
[34:20] hear the voice of the seven thunders
[34:22] thundering
[34:25] what was the long trumpet if you read
[34:27] through we won't take time to read
[34:28] through
[34:29] that long trumpet sound was him
[34:30] thundering out the ten commandments
[34:32] the ten commandments was the only law he
[34:35] was going to give them and it was a
[34:36] marriage covenant between him and them
[34:39] if you'll do this i will be your husband
[34:41] you will be my bride
[34:44] that's it the voice of god him speaking
[34:46] directly to them the 10 commandments was
[34:48] going to be
[34:49] it he was going to add no more to it
[34:52] amen
[34:52] but they refused and when they heard
[34:54] that long voice
[34:56] thundering out what was the thundering
[34:58] what was the long trumpet sound
[35:00] what was the long blast that went forth
[35:03] it was the ten commandments
[35:06] and in our day what was the long trumpet
[35:08] sound what was the long
[35:10] gospel trumpet that sounded it was the
[35:12] seven thunders
[35:14] yes so under the long trumpet
[35:17] was ten commandments and for us under
[35:20] the long trumpet
[35:22] was seven thunders
[35:27] when they heard it they were supposed to
[35:29] come up to god
[35:31] to come up to the mountain and moses
[35:34] said
[35:34] when you heard it i stood between you
[35:37] now because you refuse
[35:39] you need an intercessor you need a
[35:41] go-between now you cry out for a prophet
[35:44] and god said that's good that's what
[35:45] i'll do that's the way i'll do it from
[35:47] now on
[35:47] amen but it wasn't his original idea
[35:51] his original ideas i speak the thunders
[35:54] to you
[35:55] and you come to me
[35:59] hey amen let's go back to exodus 20
[36:06] and verse 18.
[36:14] and all the people saw the thunderings
[36:18] all the people saw the thunderings and
[36:20] the lightnings and the noise of the
[36:22] trumpet
[36:23] and the mountain smoking and when the
[36:25] people saw it they removed and stood
[36:27] afar off
[36:28] what were they supposed to do come up to
[36:30] the mountain what did they do
[36:32] ran away
[36:35] this is important we understand this
[36:37] because when we get to another passage
[36:38] of scripture we have to understand what
[36:39] happened
[36:40] they did the opposite what god told them
[36:42] to do
[36:44] they removed and stood afar off and they
[36:46] said unto moses speak thou with us and
[36:48] we will hear
[36:49] but let not god speak with us lest we
[36:52] die
[36:55] god wanted to marry them
[36:58] and god wanted to speak to them and
[37:02] they refused to hear from their husband
[37:04] and they wanted another man
[37:06] in between this is where brother branham
[37:10] said they made their fatal mistake in
[37:12] exodus 19. this
[37:13] is the fatal mistake when he said when
[37:16] you hear that trumpet sound
[37:17] come unto me and they ran away and said
[37:20] moses you go to him
[37:21] amen we want you to go we don't want to
[37:24] have to go
[37:24] but you come back tell us what we said
[37:26] and we'll do all that he said
[37:28] that wasn't the original plan or the
[37:30] original idea
[37:31] and that's where he didn't just give him
[37:33] the ten commandments now
[37:35] now he gave him a whole set of statutes
[37:37] and judgments and a law
[37:38] amen because now they couldn't accept
[37:40] grace
[37:41] and grace was the ability to hear from
[37:43] god
[37:46] what is grace to you and i the ability
[37:48] to hear from god personally
[37:50] a revelation in this day amen he may
[37:52] have used the voice of a prophet on a
[37:54] tape but amen that was not the voice of
[37:56] a prophet that
[37:57] wrote the veil in my heart that was the
[37:59] voice of god thundering out inside of me
[38:02] that rent the veil in my heart and took
[38:03] the veil away of denominationalism that
[38:06] had veiled me from
[38:07] understanding my bible
[38:12] amen because what have we done we've
[38:14] come right back to where we were
[38:16] amen amen everything that is has been
[38:18] before
[38:22] and so now they they ran away
[38:26] verse 19 and they said moses speak thou
[38:28] with us and we will hear
[38:29] but let not god speak with us lest
[38:33] we die and they chose
[38:36] law over grace
[38:43] they chose a system over
[38:46] direct contact with god
[38:51] i'm telling you well you know
[38:55] the scripture says that the sight of the
[38:59] the fire coming down and the roaring of
[39:01] the thunder and the lightning and the
[39:02] great smoke
[39:03] it was so fearful that moses said he
[39:06] exceedingly feared and quaked
[39:09] right he was exceedingly fearful it was
[39:12] a scary thing
[39:13] because now when when you hear from god
[39:16] directly
[39:17] and you go to god yourself amen
[39:20] there is no room for margin
[39:23] of error there is no room for sin
[39:27] in our life amen they could not endure
[39:30] the commandment is what the scripture
[39:32] says
[39:32] what was the commandment the commandment
[39:34] was come to me come to the burning fire
[39:37] come to the thunder come to the
[39:38] lightning come to the judge
[39:40] come to the judgment seat
[39:44] and they couldn't endure the commandment
[39:45] they couldn't obey amen but it's funny
[39:48] they couldn't do it but moses although
[39:50] he exceedingly feared
[39:52] he trembled he went into that cloud
[39:55] he went to the judgment seat he went to
[39:57] the smoke and the fire and the thunder
[39:59] and lightning
[40:00] proving that they could have went too
[40:02] they could have went but they were too
[40:03] afraid to face god themselves
[40:05] they wanted a mediator in between
[40:10] why because when you have a personal
[40:12] relationship with god you get away with
[40:14] nothing
[40:15] he reveals to the thunders and the
[40:16] lightnings and the smoke and the fire
[40:18] and he rips you wide open and he looks
[40:20] at every crack and crevice in your life
[40:22] and you get away with nothing but under
[40:24] the system all you got to do is keep the
[40:26] systems protocols
[40:28] and if you keep the systems protocols
[40:30] then your stamped is fine
[40:32] amen but if you go to god yourself
[40:34] through smoke and fire and lightning and
[40:36] voices and thunderings
[40:38] amen there's nothing between you and god
[40:40] and god will
[40:41] judge your life to purge it of sin so
[40:44] that he can dwell inside
[40:46] what did god want to do he didn't want
[40:48] to destroy them he wanted to become one
[40:50] with them but in order to become one
[40:52] with them
[40:53] they had to go to the judgment seat and
[40:55] let the thunder and lightning purge them
[40:59] purge them of what purged them of egypt
[41:02] and we've come to the same thing at the
[41:05] end of time
[41:06] amen we've come to the voices and
[41:08] thunderings and lightning
[41:09] go to revelation 4 and in revelation 4
[41:11] when john is caught up after the church
[41:13] ages and he sees one sitting on the
[41:15] throne
[41:15] and there's thunderings and lightnings
[41:18] and voices
[41:19] what is that he's coming to the judgment
[41:21] seat
[41:24] praise god that's what people don't want
[41:28] that's what we fear that's what makes us
[41:31] exceedingly fear and quake and if it
[41:33] doesn't make you exceedingly fair and
[41:35] quake there's something wrong in your
[41:36] mind
[41:38] because this is a real god
[41:41] amen but he doesn't just
[41:44] want he's not looking for another
[41:48] system another denomination another
[41:50] church
[41:51] he's looking for a wife somebody
[41:54] that'll pass through the fire of his
[41:56] word and unite with him
[42:01] but i go trembling of course you go
[42:03] trembling you should go trembling
[42:05] but let that fire and smoke and
[42:07] lightning burn it out
[42:11] where else will they be purged
[42:14] where else would they be purged but on
[42:17] top the mountain
[42:20] and they ran from the very thing that
[42:22] would have purged them from egypt and
[42:24] made them fit to unite with him
[42:28] i don't want to run from the very thing
[42:31] that god has sent in this day
[42:33] to purge me from egypt so that i can
[42:36] unite with him
[42:41] you see we're a man
[42:46] verse 19 and they said unto moses speak
[42:49] thou with us
[42:50] and we will hear but let not god speak
[42:53] with us
[42:54] lest we die
[42:58] you're supposed to die that's
[43:01] the whole point let god speak to you
[43:05] and die
[43:09] ah i can't live the message has anybody
[43:12] ever heard that before
[43:14] i love the lord but i can't live the
[43:15] message i just can't do it
[43:17] i did what's happening somebody's
[43:20] refusing to climb the mountain
[43:22] and get to the top because they're
[43:24] afraid they'll die
[43:26] when that's the very thing that's
[43:27] supposed to happen we're supposed to die
[43:30] because you can't live the message the
[43:32] way you are you have to die
[43:35] and be born again to live the message
[43:37] and so many people have run away from
[43:40] the mountain which is the message amen
[43:42] and who's at the top of the message it's
[43:44] god himself
[43:45] amen come down at the top to cap it off
[43:47] the capping stone the headstone
[43:49] jesus christ himself is there and we're
[43:51] supposed to go up to him
[43:52] but many people have run away because i
[43:55] can't live this message
[43:59] you go to god don't let him speak to us
[44:01] anymore lest we die
[44:03] and that was the whole point friends is
[44:05] to die
[44:10] so we run away from the very thing
[44:14] that we're supposed to be running to
[44:18] and blaming the word for our rebellion
[44:25] blaming god for our rebellious spirit
[44:29] i can't live that standard i can't do
[44:31] that whose standard is it
[44:34] whose word is it who gave the word who
[44:37] gave the commandment
[44:38] it's god's word god's commandment god's
[44:40] standard and now i'm blaming god for not
[44:42] serving god it's god's fault
[44:44] because he has too many standards he's
[44:46] got too many
[44:51] don't let that deceiving devil ever
[44:53] deceive you
[44:54] amen if you're a mom and a dad or a
[44:56] friend or a brother or sister or
[44:58] somebody who's running away
[44:59] saying i can't let this out it's just
[45:00] too hard don't you show pity and feel
[45:02] sorry for them
[45:03] they need to run right back up into the
[45:05] face of christ
[45:06] and say christ kill me slay me let the
[45:09] thunder slay me
[45:10] let the lightning slay me let the fire
[45:12] burn me up
[45:13] because i can't live this word i can't
[45:16] perform the word i can't
[45:18] live the message but don't pet him and
[45:21] say it's okay
[45:22] it's all right i know it's hard
[45:27] don't be deceived by that that's a lying
[45:30] devil
[45:30] trying to blame god for their rebellion
[45:36] that's the truth friends the devil's a
[45:39] slick tongue and he's always trying to
[45:41] get somebody to feel sorry for him
[45:42] it's nothing but the devil amen because
[45:44] the word will slay
[45:46] you and the word will raise you up again
[45:49] but we want to be raised up before we're
[45:51] slain
[45:54] we want to climb the mountain without it
[45:56] being scary
[45:59] or we want somebody else to climb the
[46:00] mountain for us pass us down a few
[46:02] tidbits
[46:04] to keep us alive and keep us strong on
[46:10] amen we use parents we use spouses we
[46:12] use preachers we use the prophet
[46:15] to do that very thing
[46:19] oh yeah many times people will ask a
[46:22] preacher
[46:23] what do you think about this you know
[46:24] this marriage situation what do you
[46:26] think about
[46:27] you know if you trim your hair a little
[46:28] bit what do you think about this what do
[46:29] you think about that
[46:30] you know what they're trying to do
[46:31] they're trying to avoid going to the top
[46:33] of the mountain
[46:37] or instead of praying we'll hit a quote
[46:39] list
[46:41] i got 400 quotes on this and uh
[46:44] oh yeah yeah yeah i like this quote
[46:48] right why do you pick that quote out of
[46:50] the 30 you pulled up
[46:53] on whatever subject be it trimming the
[46:55] hair be a dress
[46:56] be it whatever you want to pull up
[46:58] whatever subject you feel like pulling
[47:00] up
[47:00] entertainment or whatever and then you
[47:02] hit a you hit a quote list
[47:04] amen what made you pick that one or
[47:07] those two or those three you're
[47:10] trying to use brother branham just the
[47:12] same way they used moses back then
[47:14] you talk to god you tell me i'll do it
[47:17] then i can blame you for the rebellion
[47:19] that's in my heart
[47:20] because i want to do what i want to do
[47:22] anyways so i search to find a quote that
[47:24] tells me i can do what i want to do so
[47:26] that when i face god
[47:27] i can say brother branham said and it's
[47:29] his fault because we
[47:31] don't want to stand in the face of god
[47:34] this true word in this day
[47:35] and say judge me burn me shine the
[47:37] lightning expose me
[47:39] and let me be a real christian a real
[47:42] genuine christian
[47:43] not a message believer not a church goer
[47:45] not a bcf yet
[47:47] but i want to be a son or daughter of
[47:49] god and i want to be united in a holy
[47:51] union
[47:52] visible you with him with nothing in
[47:54] between not a spouse not a parent not a
[47:56] preacher not a church
[47:58] nothing burn me out god slay me
[48:01] dead then raise me up the way you want
[48:03] me to be
[48:07] see what i'm doing today is exposing the
[48:09] devil
[48:10] because he tries all of these little
[48:12] tactics
[48:18] you get a man who wants to be remarried
[48:20] and he's got no scriptural right to be
[48:21] remarried
[48:23] he'll go to church to church to church
[48:25] until they find a preacher that'll agree
[48:27] with him
[48:27] because he didn't want to go to the top
[48:29] of the mountain and let those seven
[48:31] thunders judge him
[48:34] it happens over and over and over again
[48:40] a lot of church switching is just so we
[48:42] don't have to go to the mountain
[48:43] ourselves
[48:45] and die and be judged
[48:50] praise be to god once you go to the top
[48:53] of that mountain
[48:53] once you're caught up into that cloud
[48:55] once you've been slain and resurrected
[48:58] it don't matter what the preacher says
[49:00] it matters what your father says
[49:02] [Applause]
[49:05] do you understand what i'm saying and it
[49:07] doesn't even matter
[49:08] what brother branham permits and the
[49:10] questions and answers when they're asked
[49:11] a question a certain way
[49:12] your heart tells you no even though the
[49:15] prophet said it would be
[49:16] okay something in you says no because
[49:18] you've been to the top of the mountain
[49:19] you've met with him directly and now
[49:22] you're not going to do it because your
[49:23] father said
[49:24] no so now you don't need a preacher's
[49:27] opinion
[49:28] you don't need to go around and get a
[49:29] consensus from the church talking to all
[49:31] the brothers what do you think about
[49:32] this what you think about that
[49:37] what we need is more people who will
[49:39] hear the trumpet blast
[49:40] and go up the mountain to meet him
[49:44] praise be to god you know how little
[49:47] trouble we'd have in the church
[49:49] how little trouble we'd have in our
[49:50] homes in our lives if we would just
[49:53] let the word slay us
[49:57] if we would just climb the mountain for
[49:59] ourselves and not be content that
[50:01] brother branham was there
[50:08] oh praise god praise god praise god
[50:13] 3 verse 19 again and they said unto
[50:17] moses speak thou with us and we will
[50:19] hear
[50:20] but let not god speak with us lest we
[50:22] die
[50:24] and moses said unto the people fear not
[50:26] for god has come to prove you
[50:28] and that his fear may be before your
[50:30] faces that you sin not
[50:33] and the people stood afar off and moses
[50:35] drew near
[50:36] unto the thick darkness where god was
[50:42] this is why moses could come down with
[50:45] an illuminated face
[50:46] and this is why the veil would go over
[50:48] their hearts they couldn't even accept
[50:51] what god had spoke through moses because
[50:53] the veil
[50:54] moved from his face to their heart
[50:56] because he's the only one
[50:58] that went up when they were all told to
[51:00] go up
[51:04] let's not live in the day where brother
[51:06] brenham's the only one who got caught
[51:08] into that cloud
[51:12] let's not live like they lived back here
[51:16] and moses you go up brother brandon you
[51:18] go up
[51:19] you get the revelation of the seven
[51:21] thunders you come preach the seals
[51:23] i'll read it and that's fine with me
[51:27] no friends i want to go up to you
[51:31] i want to go wherever he went i want to
[51:33] go if
[51:34] moses couldn't make it i can make it to
[51:39] do you understand if brother branham can
[51:41] make it i can make it too
[51:43] why because he was the wave chief
[51:45] offering
[51:46] in him was the first part of the word
[51:48] bride word to come to full harvest
[51:50] maturity
[51:51] amen showing what would happen to the
[51:53] rest of the congregation
[51:54] if he made the journey if i come to
[51:56] maturity i can make the journey too
[52:01] praise be to god let's go to hebrews
[52:05] 12 together
[52:23] hebrews 12 verse 18
[52:30] for year not come to the mount that
[52:31] might be touched
[52:33] what is the apostle paul doing he's
[52:36] taking this church
[52:37] right back to mount sinai
[52:42] you know because when paul caught the
[52:45] revelation
[52:47] what book did he read
[52:51] when paul caught the revelation for his
[52:53] day
[52:55] where did he find the prophecies in the
[52:58] revelation for his day
[53:00] he found it in the old testament
[53:04] so so paul extracted from the old
[53:07] testament
[53:08] the revelation of christ and wrote the
[53:10] new testament
[53:11] where did all the material for the new
[53:12] testament come from the old testament
[53:16] but paul had the veil removed so that he
[53:19] could read the book correctly now
[53:21] and when he read the book correctly he
[53:23] could see the mystery coming all the way
[53:26] through
[53:26] and that mystery was christ
[53:30] and now he could lay the foundation now
[53:32] paul is
[53:33] he he's caught the capping of the old
[53:36] testament
[53:37] and that image of the old testament was
[53:39] a man god in flesh
[53:41] amen amen and he caught that mystery
[53:44] amen when he caught that mystery paul
[53:46] amen he now he laid the cornerstone in
[53:49] the foundation
[53:50] for what for the bride now he realizes
[53:54] in laying
[53:55] and down jesus christ being the chief
[53:57] cornerstone built upon the foundation of
[53:59] the apostles and prophets
[54:01] and paul says i as a master a wise
[54:04] master builder has laid the foundation
[54:07] so now we realize if paul lays the
[54:10] foundation
[54:12] who's going to finish it
[54:17] paul lays the foundation where does he
[54:19] get the foundation
[54:20] where does he get the dimensions for the
[54:22] drawing he gets it out of the old
[54:23] testament
[54:25] and he brings it right up and now he
[54:26] says it's christ in you the hope of
[54:28] glory what's he doing he's laying the
[54:30] foundation that the rest of the church
[54:32] is going to be built on
[54:34] amen because the stone that he laid as
[54:35] the cornerstone is going to become the
[54:37] same as the head of the corner as the
[54:39] headstone
[54:40] which was christ the revelation of
[54:42] christ the revelation of the entire old
[54:44] testament now
[54:45] brought into the church as the
[54:46] cornerstone that the church is built on
[54:48] and every church age builds on top of
[54:50] this foundation until we come to the top
[54:53] and the same thing that started it is
[54:54] now the thing that captures it
[54:57] and so now there was a wise master
[55:00] builder that laid
[55:00] a cornerstone and a foundation and that
[55:04] master builder amen got
[55:06] all the uh the drawings and the plans
[55:08] out of the old testament and brought it
[55:10] over
[55:11] and now we come to the end of the
[55:13] building
[55:14] the capping off of the church at the end
[55:16] of the laodicean church age
[55:18] and there has to be another master
[55:20] builder because the cornerstone
[55:22] has to now fit as the headstone
[55:26] so god sends another prophet and he
[55:29] caps off what the old testament
[55:33] where does brother branham get his
[55:34] message
[55:37] he said i preached what paul preached
[55:39] what did paul preach paul preached what
[55:41] moses preached
[55:44] so that's why you know this is why
[55:46] friends brother branham could go
[55:48] all the way back to exodus and show a
[55:50] first exodus and a second exodus
[55:52] and a third exodus amen because moses he
[55:55] were here
[55:56] where moses amen had laid down the
[55:59] pattern in the word
[56:00] paul had continued the pattern in the
[56:02] word and brother branham sees the
[56:04] pattern
[56:05] and reveals the entire pattern from the
[56:07] word nothing
[56:08] has changed when the veil is taken away
[56:11] amen you could look all the way
[56:12] back from genesis to revelation and find
[56:15] us the same
[56:16] thing happening throughout the entire
[56:18] book
[56:18] [Music]
[56:21] so paul gets his message from the old
[56:24] testament
[56:25] brother branham gets his message from
[56:26] the whole bible
[56:28] why because when he preaches the seven
[56:30] seals he says and when he comes to
[56:31] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[56:33] amen when he's really breaking down the
[56:34] seventh seal he said i want to take from
[56:36] my text the entire
[56:38] bible not a new book not a new
[56:41] revelation
[56:42] amen but a veil that through the seven
[56:45] thunders a veil
[56:46] that has been taken away amen from the
[56:48] heart of a human being
[56:50] to where now he can look back and say
[56:52] i'm going to preach a message
[56:53] that's going to require the
[56:55] understanding of the entire bible
[56:58] to understand to preach this message i
[57:00] need the context of the
[57:02] whole of written scriptures
[57:05] [Music]
[57:07] we've not followed cunningly devised
[57:09] fables
[57:11] enticing words of man's wisdom but this
[57:13] is the word friends
[57:15] this is the word made manifest in our
[57:17] day
[57:18] [Music]
[57:20] let's keep reading here in hebrews
[57:22] hebrews 12
[57:24] and 18 for you're not coming to the
[57:26] mount that might be touched
[57:28] that burn with fire nor into blackness
[57:30] and darkness and tempest
[57:32] and the sound of a trumpet in the voice
[57:33] of words which voice that they heard
[57:36] entreated that the word should not be
[57:37] spoken to them anymore
[57:39] for they not could not endure that which
[57:41] was commanded
[57:42] you know it wasn't the ten commandments
[57:44] they couldn't endure because they kept
[57:46] the ten commandments
[57:48] right it wasn't the ten commandments
[57:50] because then those ten commandments were
[57:51] written on tables of stone they had them
[57:53] they copied them
[57:54] they studied them they tried to live
[57:55] them that wasn't what they couldn't
[57:57] endure
[57:57] it wasn't those ten commandments they
[57:59] couldn't endure it was the commandment
[58:01] to come up to the mountain when you hear
[58:02] the trumpet
[58:03] that's the commandment they couldn't
[58:04] endure because they were so afraid to
[58:07] face god
[58:08] one on one
[58:11] and i don't blame them because there had
[58:12] been no bloodshed for their sins yet
[58:16] but we stand in a different place seeing
[58:18] redemption cycle completed
[58:19] and we realize that there was a lamb god
[58:22] provided the lamb
[58:23] and that lamb shed his blood to cover my
[58:25] sins and now i should have no
[58:27] fear to go into the presence of god i
[58:29] can't hardly blame them back there
[58:31] because they had no shedding of blood
[58:33] for the remission of their sins but we
[58:35] have the shedding of blood
[58:37] amen we have the life of god amen on
[58:40] display
[58:41] amen we should be running up that
[58:43] mountain through the thunders and the
[58:44] lightnings and the quakes
[58:48] hallelujah hallelujah
[58:53] hallelujah
[58:56] verse 20 again for they could not endure
[58:58] that which was commanded
[59:00] and if so much as a beast touched the
[59:01] mountain it shall be stoned or thrust
[59:03] through with a dart
[59:05] and so terrible was the sight that moses
[59:07] said i exceedingly fear and quake
[59:10] but you are coming to mount zion and to
[59:12] the city of the living god the heavenly
[59:14] jerusalem
[59:15] to an innumerable company of angels to
[59:18] the general assembly in the church of
[59:19] the firstborn which are written in
[59:21] heaven
[59:21] and to god the judge of all and to the
[59:24] spirits of just men made perfect
[59:27] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[59:29] covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[59:31] that speaketh better things than that of
[59:32] abel
[59:33] see that you refuse not him that
[59:35] speaketh
[59:37] see what he's tying them to he's tying
[59:39] them to a marriage covenant and a
[59:41] marriage union
[59:42] and when it came time for the marriage
[59:44] ceremony they refused
[59:46] and they were a runaway bride
[59:49] and now he's coming here and he's
[59:51] telling this church he said don't refuse
[59:53] him that speaketh don't repeat the same
[59:56] thing
[59:58] he said now
[1:00:01] see that you refuse not him that
[1:00:03] speaketh for if they escape not who
[1:00:05] refused him that spake on earth much
[1:00:07] more shall not we escape
[1:00:08] if we turn away from him that speaketh
[1:00:10] from heaven whose voice then shook the
[1:00:12] earth but now he hath promised saying
[1:00:14] yet once more i shake not earth only but
[1:00:16] also heaven
[1:00:18] in this word yet once more signifying
[1:00:20] the removing of those things that are
[1:00:22] shaken as of those things that are made
[1:00:24] that those things which cannot be shaken
[1:00:26] may remain
[1:00:27] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:00:29] cannot be moved
[1:00:31] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[1:00:33] god acceptably
[1:00:34] with reverence and godly fear for our
[1:00:37] god
[1:00:37] is a consuming fire you realize he said
[1:00:41] you've come to the mountain but the fire
[1:00:43] of god has not
[1:00:44] changed the power and demonstration of
[1:00:47] god has not
[1:00:48] changed our god is a consuming fire
[1:00:50] approaching with fear
[1:00:51] amen approaching reverently with fear
[1:00:53] because he's still a god who wants to
[1:00:55] judge and he's still a consuming fire
[1:00:58] and i say friends that's the very reason
[1:01:00] we should run to him
[1:01:02] and let the fire of god burn all the
[1:01:04] dross out
[1:01:06] not cause us to run from him but cause
[1:01:09] us to run to him
[1:01:14] moses received the revelation of the
[1:01:17] word
[1:01:18] and he became the light so much so that
[1:01:21] a veil had to be
[1:01:22] over his face because
[1:01:28] i don't know how to say this because in
[1:01:31] their condition
[1:01:32] they cannot handle the light of god
[1:01:36] so the veil was put over their face not
[1:01:38] for moses
[1:01:40] but for the unbelievers
[1:01:43] then god from then on says i will veil
[1:01:47] myself behind human flesh i'll send the
[1:01:49] prophet
[1:01:50] and god in his mercy sent a veiled
[1:01:53] uh his light and a veil
[1:01:57] all the way down to paul paul now as
[1:02:00] is going to fulfill the prophecy that
[1:02:02] he's going to be a light to lighten the
[1:02:04] gentiles from isaiah 49
[1:02:06] and now he's going to be the one
[1:02:07] commissioned to fulfill that he's the
[1:02:09] light bearer
[1:02:10] he's carrying the light he's the prophet
[1:02:11] of god and it's still behind the veil
[1:02:21] and today the light is still behind the
[1:02:23] veil
[1:02:26] a veil on earth
[1:02:29] not one that died 50 years ago
[1:02:33] but the light of god has hid behind a
[1:02:35] veil today
[1:02:37] of vessels of clay on earth today
[1:02:41] and you can never see it till the veil
[1:02:43] is taken off of your heart
[1:02:48] so god has still veiled his word but
[1:02:51] it's not
[1:02:51] veiled to his bride
[1:02:54] brother benham referring to paul
[1:02:58] in his road to damascus experience he
[1:03:00] says paul
[1:03:01] has something greater than any of the
[1:03:03] apostles did see
[1:03:05] they said well i've got more of a
[1:03:07] revelation than you paul
[1:03:09] because you know i walked with him i
[1:03:10] went fishing with him one day i heard
[1:03:12] him talk
[1:03:13] he sat in a boat with me and actually
[1:03:15] told me let's go over here and fish in
[1:03:16] this place and
[1:03:17] we'll get more fish and we did it see
[1:03:20] see we seen him do those things
[1:03:23] but so but paul saw him after he was
[1:03:25] dead buried rose again and expressed
[1:03:27] himself in the pillar of fire
[1:03:29] that led the children of israel so paul
[1:03:32] sees him converted back to what he was
[1:03:34] in moses day
[1:03:36] and moses message and he recognizes when
[1:03:39] he sees the pillar of fire
[1:03:40] he says he knows this lord he says lord
[1:03:42] who are you says i'm jesus whom you
[1:03:44] persecuted mean the pillar of fire had
[1:03:46] now moved into the people
[1:03:47] that paul was persecuting now when he
[1:03:49] saw it as a pillar of fire he knew it
[1:03:51] was the same pillar of fire that led the
[1:03:52] children out of israel
[1:03:54] so the same one that let them are out of
[1:03:57] egypt the same one that led him out of
[1:03:58] egypt
[1:03:59] was now abiding in a people and paul was
[1:04:02] persecuting those people
[1:04:03] so he showed himself to paul in his
[1:04:05] original form of a pillar of fire
[1:04:07] and paul knew that was the lord and then
[1:04:09] he identified himself
[1:04:11] as jesus what was he doing paul did not
[1:04:14] see the man who had been
[1:04:15] pierced but he saw jesus
[1:04:21] do we understand paul did not see the
[1:04:24] man who was in peers but when he saw the
[1:04:26] light he asked the light who are you
[1:04:28] he's communicating with the light
[1:04:30] because the light is a person
[1:04:34] oh just let our carnal mind melt down to
[1:04:36] oblivion right now
[1:04:37] but the light is a person the person of
[1:04:40] the word was speaking to paul
[1:04:41] and say paul why do you persecute me he
[1:04:44] said who are you
[1:04:45] what is now now what is paul going to
[1:04:47] receive paul is going to receive the
[1:04:49] interpretation
[1:04:50] of the word will become the
[1:04:51] manifestation of god
[1:04:53] because the interpretation of the word
[1:04:56] is i'm not
[1:04:57] jesus who was pierced and then say i'm
[1:04:59] jesus who hung on a cross
[1:05:01] he said i am jesus whom you persecute
[1:05:04] present tense jesus in the people today
[1:05:07] so the manifestation of the name of god
[1:05:10] is the interpretation of the word
[1:05:12] present tense and paul did not get
[1:05:15] an old image of jesus paul got a present
[1:05:18] tense image of jesus
[1:05:20] and the present tense image of jesus
[1:05:22] revealed the revelation of the hour to
[1:05:25] paul
[1:05:25] and positionally placed paul in the
[1:05:28] program
[1:05:28] and if we want to get positionally
[1:05:30] placed in the program we can't keep
[1:05:32] looking back to the man
[1:05:34] who walked the sea of galilee we've got
[1:05:36] to find the strong tower today
[1:05:38] because the word interpreted today is
[1:05:41] the manifestation of the name
[1:05:43] i can be saying the name and get no
[1:05:45] benefit of the name
[1:05:46] because i don't know who's carrying the
[1:05:48] name now
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:53] oh you're a mature people you understand
[1:05:55] what i'm talking we're not taking away
[1:05:57] from the manifestation of god and flesh
[1:06:00] amen guess what we're going to enjoy
[1:06:02] worshiping jesus
[1:06:04] christ in the flesh seeing his nail
[1:06:06] scars at some point
[1:06:07] and we will bow before that vessel and
[1:06:09] we will worship and enjoy it
[1:06:12] he'll sit as a king of the whole world
[1:06:15] on the throne of david
[1:06:16] and he will get worship from the whole
[1:06:17] world including his bride and we will
[1:06:19] worship him and enjoy that
[1:06:21] not diminishing from that but if we go
[1:06:23] back we're going to miss what paul got
[1:06:25] what paul got was a present tense jesus
[1:06:28] and the present chance jesus was the
[1:06:30] only thing that can cure his blindness
[1:06:33] he had a veil over his heart amen and
[1:06:35] looking back was not going to cure the
[1:06:37] veil in his heart
[1:06:38] he had to meet jesus christ for his day
[1:06:43] oh praise god we shouldn't be afraid of
[1:06:47] that that's the one of the most powerful
[1:06:49] revelations that we can ever give to
[1:06:50] somebody
[1:06:51] is that jesus christ is alive and well
[1:06:53] today behind the veil
[1:06:55] the same one that led him out of egypt
[1:06:57] as a pillar of fire
[1:06:58] the same one paul met on the road to
[1:07:00] damascus the same one that appeared in a
[1:07:03] cloud
[1:07:03] is still here inside his bride
[1:07:06] [Applause]
[1:07:09] praise be the god where is that cloud
[1:07:16] they realize i wish i could have seen
[1:07:18] the cloud
[1:07:24] if you can't see it now
[1:07:28] you need to go yourself into the cloud
[1:07:32] so the veil can be taken over your heart
[1:07:35] because the cloud is here
[1:07:38] the cloud is still here
[1:07:44] brother branham when he looked at that
[1:07:45] cloud
[1:07:48] he saw a pyramid a white pyramid
[1:07:52] reflecting back to judeo-jackson's dream
[1:07:55] because inside
[1:07:57] that pyramid of stone which represented
[1:07:59] the word of god had funny writing all
[1:08:01] over the outside
[1:08:02] brother had to go around amen and what
[1:08:04] carved the writing
[1:08:05] the word that had been washing down over
[1:08:06] it had carved this funny writing
[1:08:08] oh the word had made a writing in our
[1:08:10] bible
[1:08:13] and nobody could interpret it but
[1:08:15] brother branham he was the only one who
[1:08:16] could interpret it so now he comes as
[1:08:18] the seventh church age messenger to
[1:08:20] interpret the writing on the outside
[1:08:26] and then he took a sharp instrument and
[1:08:28] peeled the top off and showed that
[1:08:29] there's another pyramid within the
[1:08:31] pyramid
[1:08:33] there's unwritten word inside the
[1:08:34] written word
[1:08:36] and inside the written word is the
[1:08:38] mystery of what this is all about
[1:08:42] so when brother branham sees that
[1:08:43] pyramid of a cloud he's tying it right
[1:08:45] back to junior jackson's stream
[1:08:47] and here comes a white pyramid cloud
[1:08:53] and he gets caught up into the midst of
[1:08:55] that pyramid
[1:08:57] because in the white rock is the
[1:09:00] revelation
[1:09:01] of the unwritten word or the seven
[1:09:03] thunders that takes the mystery off the
[1:09:05] whole bible
[1:09:08] and so brother bread and where does
[1:09:10] brother branham go when the cloud
[1:09:12] appears where does he go
[1:09:13] he goes into the midst into the middle
[1:09:16] of the pyramid
[1:09:21] because you've got to find yourself in
[1:09:24] that pyramid
[1:09:28] oh i hope it's not too mysterious
[1:09:32] brother i was talking symbols and he's
[1:09:34] using types and shadows and
[1:09:36] pyramids this and pyramids that
[1:09:39] but the pyramid coming out of the earth
[1:09:41] where the water had washed it away and
[1:09:43] exposed that there was a pyramid
[1:09:44] amen and the words on it brother rims
[1:09:47] tying together
[1:09:48] the loose sins from the seven church
[1:09:49] ages and revealing serpent seed water
[1:09:51] baptism
[1:09:52] godhead he's revealing all that and when
[1:09:54] he's done revealing all of that
[1:09:55] after he ties together all the loose
[1:09:57] sins he pops the top off and reveals
[1:10:00] that within the bible just take the
[1:10:02] pyramid as the bible
[1:10:04] with the ink blots you can read but he
[1:10:07] pops the top off and shows there's white
[1:10:08] stone with nothing written on it
[1:10:10] showing that there's something else in
[1:10:13] this bible
[1:10:14] in the same shape and form of the bible
[1:10:17] amen but
[1:10:18] light has never shown on this before
[1:10:21] meaning it's a revelation that no one's
[1:10:23] ever looked at before because brother
[1:10:25] branham said
[1:10:26] they were probing at the seals what the
[1:10:29] white horse meant what the red horse
[1:10:30] meant
[1:10:31] but nobody ever knew there were seven
[1:10:33] thunders to be revealed
[1:10:37] light's never shown on this before what
[1:10:40] is it
[1:10:40] a mystery inside the word that's the
[1:10:43] same
[1:10:44] shape of the word
[1:10:48] but it's going to take an encounter with
[1:10:51] jesus christ
[1:10:52] himself for him to be able to interpret
[1:10:56] the unwritten word which is what what's
[1:11:00] the unwritten word
[1:11:01] what the white horse is what the red no
[1:11:03] friends
[1:11:04] the unwritten word is the mystery that's
[1:11:07] been laying all through the bible
[1:11:08] that he showed all the way back in
[1:11:10] genesis when he made a man and out of
[1:11:11] the man he took a woman and he put the
[1:11:13] two together in a garden of eden and
[1:11:15] there it is right there
[1:11:16] and the whole bible has been god getting
[1:11:18] back to that
[1:11:21] and that's the pyramid inside the
[1:11:23] pyramid what's the whole bible been
[1:11:25] about the whole bible has been about
[1:11:27] that
[1:11:27] the whole bible is a love story the
[1:11:30] whole bible is christ the mystery of god
[1:11:32] revealed and
[1:11:33] christ is just like adam he's the last
[1:11:35] adam the first adam had a bride the last
[1:11:37] adam has a bride
[1:11:38] the first adam and his bride ruled over
[1:11:41] the earth in a perfect condition called
[1:11:43] an eden
[1:11:43] amen and the the last adam with his
[1:11:46] bride is going to rule over the earth in
[1:11:47] a perfect condition like in eden
[1:11:49] what is it it's the mystery within the
[1:11:52] word
[1:11:54] and brother and and the word is christ
[1:11:58] jesus christ christ christ is the
[1:12:01] mystery of god revealed
[1:12:02] so when he sees that when he sees that
[1:12:04] pyramid coming down
[1:12:06] that cloud pyramid coming down he gets
[1:12:08] caught up into the middle of that
[1:12:10] and all brother branham knows at that
[1:12:11] time is that seven angels
[1:12:14] representing the mystery through the
[1:12:16] seven church ages and the seven angels
[1:12:18] making up a pyramid
[1:12:19] and he gets caught into that and they
[1:12:21] bring him back east for the
[1:12:22] interpretation of the seven thunders
[1:12:26] and he doesn't even know where he was
[1:12:28] just in the constellation of angels
[1:12:32] until a little bit later after he
[1:12:33] preaches the seals he's looking at the
[1:12:35] picture
[1:12:36] and a voice says turn it right
[1:12:40] and he says it is right like he can see
[1:12:43] the horizon the grounds here the
[1:12:45] pictures there
[1:12:46] and he was then i thought they said turn
[1:12:48] it right and i thought maybe meant to
[1:12:50] the right
[1:12:50] and we turned it right he said there it
[1:12:52] was
[1:12:54] hoffman's head of christ the headship
[1:12:58] the pyramid the capping stone the great
[1:13:00] revelation that's going to cap
[1:13:02] off the whole bible to reveal what the
[1:13:04] whole bible's been about
[1:13:06] that great capstone was the headship of
[1:13:09] christ himself
[1:13:10] the mind of christ amen the headship the
[1:13:12] husband coming to the bride
[1:13:14] all of these terms that he used it all
[1:13:16] means the same thing
[1:13:19] and when it comes down it caps off the
[1:13:22] bride
[1:13:22] and when brother branham turns that
[1:13:24] capping stone he realizes
[1:13:27] it is the headstone because he sees the
[1:13:30] head of christ hoffman's head of christ
[1:13:32] at 33.
[1:13:33] showing who this revelation is all about
[1:13:38] the bride is his body he's the head the
[1:13:40] two have united back together in an
[1:13:42] invisible union
[1:13:46] that's a wonderful story it's an amazing
[1:13:49] story
[1:13:52] but if we let brother brandon be the
[1:13:54] only one who got caught up in that cloud
[1:13:57] we've done no different than the
[1:13:59] israelites did standing at mount zion
[1:14:04] because brother didn't get caught in
[1:14:05] that cloud just so he can continue to be
[1:14:07] a mediator between us
[1:14:08] and god he got caught in that cloud to
[1:14:12] show us
[1:14:13] that now you can go into the mind of
[1:14:16] christ
[1:14:18] what is it it's the head where did he go
[1:14:20] into the head he went into the mind of
[1:14:23] christ
[1:14:23] the mysteries revealed the mystery the
[1:14:26] seals that had sealed up the entire
[1:14:28] book being loosed opening up the entire
[1:14:30] bible the mind of christ is now
[1:14:32] available
[1:14:33] and you yourself can go into the mind of
[1:14:35] christ
[1:14:37] because if we just let brother branham
[1:14:38] go there
[1:14:40] just like moses going to the top of the
[1:14:41] mountain and coming out and brother bam
[1:14:43] tells us all about it
[1:14:44] that is the reason for 50 some years
[1:14:47] amen we've been fussing and fighting
[1:14:49] over quotes
[1:14:50] is because we let brother branham go up
[1:14:51] into the mind of christ
[1:14:53] come out and give us a tapes and put it
[1:14:56] in a book and we tape the books
[1:14:57] and we start fighting each other on the
[1:14:59] quotes and then why are we fighting over
[1:15:01] the quotes the same reason the sadducees
[1:15:03] and the pharisees
[1:15:04] and the herodians and all of them were
[1:15:06] fighting over the quotes
[1:15:07] because they didn't go to the mountain
[1:15:09] themselves to get the revelation from
[1:15:11] god
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:15] but what is it we're supposed to do get
[1:15:18] caught up
[1:15:20] get caught up and go into the mind of
[1:15:22] christ go
[1:15:24] into the cloud ourselves to do what
[1:15:27] to be resurrected to go
[1:15:30] in the rapture amen what do you mean go
[1:15:32] in the rest of the church
[1:15:33] brother branham said when you heard that
[1:15:35] eagle scream when you recognize what it
[1:15:36] was you were raptured right up right
[1:15:38] then
[1:15:39] i've been raptured up where did you get
[1:15:41] raptured to i
[1:15:42] raptured right up into that cloud right
[1:15:44] into the mind of christ and god told me
[1:15:46] who i was and he told me who he was amen
[1:15:49] and now i can come back down and we can
[1:15:51] talk about those things and we read our
[1:15:53] book and the book becomes a new book
[1:15:56] christ as the mystery of god revealed
[1:15:57] becomes a new book amen
[1:15:59] the book of revelation becomes a new
[1:16:00] book why because we
[1:16:02] ourselves went to the same place the
[1:16:04] prophet went
[1:16:08] see the israelites were afraid to go
[1:16:12] there
[1:16:14] it was scary to go there because there
[1:16:17] was
[1:16:17] huge consequences for going there
[1:16:22] and i'll say the same thing there's huge
[1:16:25] consequences for getting caught up into
[1:16:26] that cloud
[1:16:29] huge because you can't hide your life
[1:16:31] you can't play pretend
[1:16:32] and you can't play church anymore now
[1:16:35] it's you and christ and nobody in
[1:16:37] between
[1:16:38] and there's no games there's no
[1:16:39] churchianity there's no looking nice for
[1:16:41] the
[1:16:42] for the people and the pews next to me
[1:16:44] none of that counts anymore
[1:16:49] it's risky business man
[1:16:52] you know what else happens
[1:16:56] you take on the mind of christ you take
[1:16:57] on the nature of christ
[1:16:59] and anybody who's ever taken on the
[1:17:01] nature of christ has been rejected
[1:17:03] and hated and stoned and beheaded
[1:17:07] amen everyone look at noah look at
[1:17:11] isaiah look at jeremiah look at dave
[1:17:13] look at them all
[1:17:14] everyone who's went and caught a
[1:17:16] revelation a man of their day
[1:17:18] and then got a portion of the mind of
[1:17:20] christ and began to express that
[1:17:21] everyone was rejected and hated of men
[1:17:26] it's risky to go to that it's risky to
[1:17:29] go to the top of mount
[1:17:30] zion but where did he come he come to
[1:17:33] the top of mount zion the cat
[1:17:35] mount zion and that's the only place to
[1:17:37] be in an
[1:17:38] individual personal revelation of who
[1:17:41] jesus christ is today i want to send
[1:17:45] notice
[1:17:46] the group thing is done
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:50] the group message walk is done
[1:17:53] finished won't work
[1:17:57] all of us being together
[1:18:01] done i want to be together we love to be
[1:18:04] together
[1:18:06] but all of us being comfortable because
[1:18:08] we're together that's finished that
[1:18:10] won't work no more
[1:18:12] we got to get down to the fact if i'm by
[1:18:15] myself
[1:18:16] all alone with not another believer
[1:18:18] around i
[1:18:19] still know who i am and who he is i know
[1:18:22] what happened today i know what that
[1:18:23] cloud was
[1:18:24] i know what the revelation of the
[1:18:25] mystery of christ i can't explain it
[1:18:27] thoroughly
[1:18:28] i may not be able to diagram it for you
[1:18:30] but i know
[1:18:31] inside of me the veil has been taken
[1:18:33] over my heart
[1:18:34] and i behold him as in the glass and i'm
[1:18:37] being changed into the thing i'm looking
[1:18:39] at
[1:18:39] he's chained he's absolutely changing me
[1:18:42] amen i'm already
[1:18:44] resurrected in christ jesus i'm my
[1:18:46] brother brethren said the quickening
[1:18:47] power
[1:18:48] which is this revelation friends don't
[1:18:50] kid yourself
[1:18:51] not a sensation not an emotion but this
[1:18:54] revelation
[1:18:55] of you getting caught up into the mind
[1:18:57] of christ it is the quickening power
[1:18:59] that comes that'll quicken your mortal
[1:19:02] body
[1:19:02] into a raptured condition now
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:06] brother branham said so the easter seal
[1:19:09] go read it amen you used to smoke you
[1:19:12] used to drink you used to do this hey
[1:19:13] i think friends we should still be
[1:19:15] saying i used to and you say when you
[1:19:18] say last week
[1:19:19] because that quickening power is working
[1:19:20] in me every day to change me for what i
[1:19:23] was to what i am
[1:19:24] rapturing and rapturing and rapturing
[1:19:26] and rapturing until this body's done
[1:19:29] rapturing amen
[1:19:32] because i'm in the rapture and the word
[1:19:34] is taking effect and it is lifting me
[1:19:36] higher
[1:19:36] i'm not in the world anymore i don't
[1:19:39] live like the world anymore
[1:19:40] the things that used to hold me don't
[1:19:42] hold me anymore
[1:19:46] i've been resurrected out of the church
[1:19:48] ages brought out a denominationalism
[1:19:51] amen lifted onto a higher plane raptured
[1:19:53] where raptured into that cloud
[1:19:57] bringing this body into a raptured
[1:19:58] condition
[1:20:00] oh praise be to god it's
[1:20:04] not it's not good enough that moses went
[1:20:07] to the mountain
[1:20:11] where did that leave israel
[1:20:16] i say it's not good enough that brother
[1:20:18] branham got caught into the cloud
[1:20:21] the constellation of angels
[1:20:25] i've got to be caught into the
[1:20:26] constellation
[1:20:28] constellation of angels into the mind of
[1:20:31] christ
[1:20:32] connected to my headship my
[1:20:36] headship my personal
[1:20:40] headship the person of the word
[1:20:43] the lord jesus christ today
[1:20:48] what paul got in his day i've got to
[1:20:51] have in my day
[1:20:53] i've got to have an encounter with the
[1:20:55] pillar of fire
[1:20:57] that i know is the lord god almighty
[1:20:59] when i ask him who
[1:21:00] am i he says i am christ
[1:21:04] the message that you're believing i am
[1:21:08] christ the word that you're feeding on
[1:21:10] i'm christ
[1:21:11] the bride that you're dwelling with i am
[1:21:13] christ
[1:21:17] amen that's the only way to make it in
[1:21:20] this day
[1:21:21] is to get caught into that cloud
[1:21:26] ourselves
[1:21:28] brother branham was the tool that god
[1:21:29] used to show that there was a
[1:21:31] white rock under the rock he's the tool
[1:21:34] that god used to show what would happen
[1:21:36] in the wave chief when
[1:21:38] when when he gets caught up but he was
[1:21:40] demonstrating for you and i
[1:21:44] and i want to go to the top of this
[1:21:46] mount zion i don't want to stand here at
[1:21:48] the bottom and say
[1:21:48] i've come to mount zion i've come to
[1:21:50] mount zion it's like coming to mount
[1:21:52] sinai i'm at mount sinai i'm outside
[1:21:54] that
[1:21:55] god didn't want them at mount sinai god
[1:21:57] wanted them to him
[1:22:00] i've come to the word i've come to the
[1:22:02] word but have you united with the person
[1:22:04] of the word
[1:22:06] if we unite with the person of the word
[1:22:09] we get caught into the mind of christ he
[1:22:12] takes the veil over our hearts
[1:22:15] and every time we pick up a message book
[1:22:18] it's a new book every time we read our
[1:22:21] bible
[1:22:23] it's a new bible there's a quote here i
[1:22:27] want to read
[1:22:28] i'm so far away from where i thought i'd
[1:22:30] be but praise be to god
[1:22:31] anyhow
[1:22:35] the seventh seal he says i was standing
[1:22:38] right there and this explosion left and
[1:22:40] i was looking this way towards the west
[1:22:41] and they come and just pick me up
[1:22:43] and there and i went plum out of my
[1:22:45] knowing
[1:22:50] that's the key he just gave us the key
[1:22:53] when you get caught up into this
[1:22:55] constellation of angels you're going to
[1:22:56] get plumb out of your knowing
[1:22:58] i thought i knew the message i thought i
[1:23:00] knew the bible i thought i knew that
[1:23:02] but i got plumb out of my knowing and i
[1:23:04] realized i've been missing the whole
[1:23:06] thing
[1:23:10] praise be to god i say god
[1:23:14] catch me up till i go plum out of my
[1:23:15] knowing and then you inject your life
[1:23:18] your mind right into my heart tear the
[1:23:21] veil away
[1:23:21] amen and let me see the light for this
[1:23:24] day you realize
[1:23:25] it was the setting of the sun amen when
[1:23:27] that cloud appeared it appeared wind
[1:23:29] at the setting of the sun i enjoyed that
[1:23:32] song
[1:23:33] and it was saying i didn't even know we
[1:23:35] were going to sing it tonight but man it
[1:23:36] was good
[1:23:37] and the setting of the sun and the
[1:23:39] setting of the sun
[1:23:40] the only thing that was still
[1:23:42] illuminated was that cloud
[1:23:44] and brother branham called that cloud a
[1:23:46] light
[1:23:47] so the only light left when the sun goes
[1:23:50] down on civilization in laodicea in the
[1:23:52] church ages
[1:23:53] the only light left is that cloud
[1:23:57] and that cloud is the headship that's in
[1:24:00] the bride
[1:24:01] and now that light is in you and i amen
[1:24:04] and the same thing that struck down paul
[1:24:06] is in you amen
[1:24:09] and i pray to god that it strikes down
[1:24:11] somebody else on the road
[1:24:13] and they say god what is that and it'll
[1:24:15] say this is me
[1:24:16] amen this is me in that person and this
[1:24:19] person and that person it's
[1:24:20] me paul in that bride
[1:24:23] praise god then somebody else
[1:24:27] will get caught up into the cloud
[1:24:30] i in you you and me where am i supposed
[1:24:34] to be
[1:24:34] in the cloud where's the cloud supposed
[1:24:36] to be in me
[1:24:40] when paul when when when brother branham
[1:24:42] got caught into the cloud he got
[1:24:43] raptured
[1:24:48] and if you're going to get called to the
[1:24:49] cloud you're going to get raptured
[1:24:52] lifted off the earth and off the
[1:24:54] cardinal
[1:24:56] and lifted into the heavenly realm
[1:24:59] so we can see what's going on all around
[1:25:02] us
[1:25:05] say god don't let me be an israelite
[1:25:08] standing
[1:25:09] the side of cyanide don't let me keep
[1:25:13] saying
[1:25:13] brother branham went to that cloud and
[1:25:15] brother branham got caught up in the
[1:25:16] constellation and brother branham got
[1:25:17] the revelation of the thunders and
[1:25:19] brother brandon preached the thunders
[1:25:20] and brother branham and brother branham
[1:25:21] and brother branham and brother branham
[1:25:24] what does that make us israelites
[1:25:32] paul brought us back to another mountain
[1:25:34] mount zion
[1:25:36] the heavenly city an innumerable company
[1:25:38] of angels he brought us
[1:25:41] but we got to go to the top of that
[1:25:43] mountain where the headstones come down
[1:25:46] and go into that cloud and let it
[1:25:49] thunder
[1:25:51] and lightning and quake
[1:25:54] and let the consuming fire burn all the
[1:25:57] world out
[1:25:58] and be united in a married union with
[1:26:01] him
[1:26:03] oh i want it more than anything in the
[1:26:05] world i want it for
[1:26:06] everybody more than anything in the
[1:26:08] world the church disappears but if
[1:26:11] you've been in that cloud
[1:26:12] everything's going to be fine everybody
[1:26:15] you love you and you love
[1:26:16] vanishes off the face of the earth if
[1:26:18] you've been in that cloud and that cloud
[1:26:19] is new everything will be fine
[1:26:22] because you've connected to the headship
[1:26:25] i
[1:26:25] and you you and me declaring they're all
[1:26:28] one
[1:26:30] where was the pillar of fire in paul's
[1:26:31] day and the believer where's the cloud
[1:26:33] today
[1:26:34] and the believer why because we've been
[1:26:37] caught into the cloud and the clouds
[1:26:38] come alive in us
[1:26:40] the only light left was that cloud and
[1:26:43] now that cloud that pillar of fire is in
[1:26:45] us
[1:26:46] and it's the only light left on this
[1:26:48] earth friends
[1:26:50] and it's veiled behind a veil of human
[1:26:53] flesh
[1:26:54] but let god rip the veil of our hearts
[1:26:57] so we can see it
[1:26:59] in the holy place
[1:27:02] before we close i want to look at two
[1:27:04] scriptures
[1:27:06] turn with me to revelation 21.
[1:27:10] there's a reason i want to look at this
[1:27:17] i want to show you the effect of going
[1:27:19] into that cloud
[1:27:26] revelations revelation 21
[1:27:30] 15.
[1:27:34] and he that talked with me had a golden
[1:27:36] read
[1:27:38] who was it that was talking to him
[1:27:41] who is me me is john
[1:27:44] john's a type of who the bride
[1:27:47] who's talking to john the angel
[1:27:50] which angel well let's go back to verse
[1:27:53] one
[1:27:54] or verse nine revelation 21 9.
[1:27:58] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:27:59] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:28:01] the seven last plagues
[1:28:02] and talked with me saying come hither i
[1:28:05] will show thee the bride
[1:28:06] the lamb's wife this is one of the seven
[1:28:09] angels with the seven last plagues
[1:28:10] this happens to be the scripture brother
[1:28:12] branham used at the beginning
[1:28:14] of choosing of a bride
[1:28:20] this is the angel one of the seven
[1:28:24] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:28:26] the seven last plagues
[1:28:27] that's the angel we're talking about
[1:28:29] he's the angel talking to john
[1:28:31] i don't believe that there's a bunch of
[1:28:33] different angels talking to john
[1:28:34] i think it's one angel that jesus christ
[1:28:37] sent and signified his revelation to
[1:28:39] by to his to john same angel
[1:28:43] all the way through
[1:28:47] verse 15 and he that talked with me had
[1:28:50] a golden read to measure the city and
[1:28:51] the gates thereof and the wall thereof
[1:28:53] and the city lies four square and the
[1:28:55] length is as large as the
[1:28:56] breath and he measured the city he
[1:28:59] measured the city with the reed twelve
[1:29:01] thousand furlongs
[1:29:02] the length and the breath and the height
[1:29:04] of it are equal and he measured the wall
[1:29:06] there of 144 cubits according to the
[1:29:08] measure of a man
[1:29:09] which is of the angel
[1:29:13] who in our day was an angel
[1:29:16] that gave us the dimensions of the city
[1:29:20] and the measurement of the city and the
[1:29:22] shape of the city
[1:29:25] the same angel that brought the
[1:29:27] revelation of jesus christ to john
[1:29:32] so we know who this is and he was given
[1:29:34] a golden read amen a golden read
[1:29:36] and speaking deity the pure word he was
[1:29:38] given a golden reed by which he could
[1:29:40] measure this city
[1:29:42] now go with me to revelation 11.
[1:29:51] revelation let's go to revelation 10.
[1:29:56] revelation 10 and 7 but in the days of
[1:29:59] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:30:00] shall begin to sound
[1:30:02] the mystery of god should be finished as
[1:30:03] he had declared to his servants the
[1:30:05] prophets
[1:30:07] verse 8 and the voice which i heard from
[1:30:08] heaven spaking to me again and said go
[1:30:10] and take the little book
[1:30:11] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:30:13] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:30:15] earth
[1:30:15] and i went into the angel and said unto
[1:30:17] him give me the little book
[1:30:18] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:30:20] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:30:22] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:30:24] honey
[1:30:25] and i took the little book out of the
[1:30:26] angel's hand and ate it up
[1:30:28] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[1:30:30] and as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[1:30:31] was bitter
[1:30:33] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:30:35] again before many peoples
[1:30:37] nations and tongues and kings
[1:30:41] now the question is where is the voice
[1:30:48] thou must prophesy again brother brenham
[1:30:51] said she will be the final voice to the
[1:30:52] final age
[1:30:53] his voice will be in the bride
[1:30:57] because we see it right here in the
[1:30:59] scriptures
[1:31:01] now let's go to chapter 11.
[1:31:05] and there was given me a read who's me
[1:31:10] john the bride
[1:31:13] now after she eats the book
[1:31:17] and becomes one with the word and is
[1:31:20] commanded to prophesy again
[1:31:22] now it says and there was given me a
[1:31:24] reed like unto a rod
[1:31:26] and the angel stood saying arise and
[1:31:28] measure the temple of god
[1:31:30] what's the temple of god the dwelling
[1:31:32] place of god the only provided place of
[1:31:35] worship
[1:31:37] measure the temple of god in the altar
[1:31:41] where's the altar he had three
[1:31:46] the first one was in heaven then in
[1:31:48] christ and the third is in man
[1:31:52] and the altar and them that worship
[1:31:54] thereon
[1:31:55] the true worshipers but the courtroom
[1:31:57] which is without the temple leave out
[1:31:59] and measure it not
[1:32:00] for it is given unto the gentiles and
[1:32:02] the holy city shall be tread underfoot
[1:32:04] forty in two months
[1:32:08] you realize friends something
[1:32:10] transitioned
[1:32:13] in revelation 10 8-11 that now
[1:32:16] the reed is not given to the seventh
[1:32:19] angel but the measuring reed has now
[1:32:21] been given to john
[1:32:24] and the angel tells john to take the
[1:32:27] reed
[1:32:28] and measure the temple and the altar
[1:32:32] and them that worship thereon because
[1:32:34] now the bride
[1:32:35] knows the proper place of worship and
[1:32:37] now she knows the truth
[1:32:39] and now she can take the word and she
[1:32:42] can measure out
[1:32:43] the proper place where the temple and
[1:32:45] the altar and them that worship there
[1:32:47] and she knows about the gentiles that
[1:32:48] will be on the outside
[1:32:52] do you understand friends you can keep
[1:32:54] saying brother brandon brother brandon
[1:32:56] brother ben and brother branham
[1:32:57] but god wants the bride to prophesy
[1:32:59] again
[1:33:00] god has given us the measuring tool god
[1:33:03] has said
[1:33:04] now now the angel says now you take the
[1:33:07] same tool
[1:33:08] and measure it out
[1:33:11] not a new word not new prophecies not
[1:33:14] new this but take the same thing that's
[1:33:17] been given
[1:33:18] amen and prophesy again take the same
[1:33:20] thing that's been given to us
[1:33:22] the angel showed us how to measure with
[1:33:24] this golden reed now there's a reed
[1:33:25] given to john
[1:33:26] that john can go and measure
[1:33:31] and when is he measuring
[1:33:34] he's measuring just before the two
[1:33:37] witnesses come on the scene
[1:33:41] see in order to do this we've got to get
[1:33:44] caught up
[1:33:46] into the mind of christ we've got to
[1:33:48] catch the same revelation brother
[1:33:51] branham caught
[1:33:52] you know the apostle paul
[1:33:56] preached what moses wrote
[1:33:59] is that right but the apostle paul
[1:34:03] didn't just come and read genesis
[1:34:06] chapter 1. we'll start at verse 1. we'll
[1:34:08] read to 27 close your book
[1:34:10] okay because i'm just going to preach
[1:34:11] what moses wrote that's right
[1:34:14] amen everything paul preached
[1:34:17] he caught by revelation of christ out in
[1:34:19] the wilderness for three and a half
[1:34:21] years
[1:34:21] and he come and he took that word and he
[1:34:23] placed it and he took the word and
[1:34:24] placed it
[1:34:25] and took the word and placed it
[1:34:29] and then brother branham comes along
[1:34:33] and he says i preached what paul
[1:34:34] preached
[1:34:36] but brother bram didn't come to the
[1:34:38] service one night and say okay
[1:34:40] open the book amen
[1:34:43] all right romans chapter one let's read
[1:34:45] through chapter 1. close the book
[1:34:46] let's go home because i only want to
[1:34:48] preach what paul preached
[1:34:52] do you understand what i'm saying he
[1:34:55] caught the revelation of what paul
[1:34:57] preached and when he caught the paul
[1:34:59] revelation
[1:35:00] he could preach everything paul preached
[1:35:01] and he could go into the old testament
[1:35:03] and pull out types that paul didn't
[1:35:05] talk about he could use scriptures that
[1:35:08] paul didn't use
[1:35:09] your scriptures that jesus didn't use
[1:35:11] paul could use scriptures that jesus
[1:35:12] didn't refer to
[1:35:14] why because it's one revelation one
[1:35:16] mystery
[1:35:17] one goal that god won't achieve in all
[1:35:19] of the bible amen and when we get caught
[1:35:21] up into the mind of christ and he
[1:35:23] reveals to us that one mystery
[1:35:25] that one goal that one purpose in a
[1:35:27] threefold manner then we can go back
[1:35:29] and we can see it here and here and here
[1:35:31] and here and here
[1:35:34] guess what brother branham never
[1:35:36] preached at a song of solomon
[1:35:39] are we allowed to work preach out a song
[1:35:41] of solomon
[1:35:44] how can we preach out a song of solomon
[1:35:47] because there's been given to you a read
[1:35:51] where do we get the read from the
[1:35:53] prophet
[1:35:55] and who told us to measure the angel
[1:35:59] brother brandon said if i preach this
[1:36:01] i'd go around and around that clock
[1:36:03] if i preach this i could preach a month
[1:36:04] of services on this and never touch it
[1:36:06] but when you go home you go study it and
[1:36:08] god will reveal it to you
[1:36:11] when god when when he opened the seals
[1:36:14] he
[1:36:15] tore open the whole bible the bible's
[1:36:17] loose to us
[1:36:18] and we've been given a read to measure
[1:36:20] it by and what's that read it's the
[1:36:22] message of the hour
[1:36:23] is the true interpretation of the word
[1:36:27] and how do you get it by getting caught
[1:36:30] up in a rapture
[1:36:32] into the mind of christ until he can
[1:36:34] reveal to you the threefold plan
[1:36:37] when you come down all of a sudden
[1:36:41] everything's different the veil is taken
[1:36:44] away from the heart
[1:36:46] and i see the word differently here in
[1:36:48] here and he keeps taking away the veil
[1:36:51] it keeps taking away the veil and we
[1:36:53] keep seeing christ
[1:36:54] more clearly than we've ever seen him
[1:36:56] before
[1:36:59] see going to the mountain was risky
[1:37:04] going to the cloud is risky
[1:37:07] but if we don't go
[1:37:11] we become a pharisee or a sadducee
[1:37:16] or a herodian because if we're not
[1:37:19] willing to go
[1:37:20] into that cloud and get a revelation of
[1:37:23] this mystery of god ourselves
[1:37:26] we'll gather safety quotes
[1:37:31] and safety scriptures and
[1:37:34] and hide behind the wall we built
[1:37:37] of our safety quotes and safety
[1:37:39] scriptures
[1:37:41] and will start to fight anybody else
[1:37:47] that contradicts our safety quotes or
[1:37:49] our safety scriptures
[1:37:54] what's the cure
[1:37:57] when you hear the trumpet go to the top
[1:37:59] of the mountain amen
[1:38:02] what's the cure get caught up into the
[1:38:04] heavenlies and into the mind of christ
[1:38:06] and say jesus christ reveal this message
[1:38:08] to me personally
[1:38:09] i don't want another quote book from a
[1:38:11] human being i don't want to just repeat
[1:38:14] my pastor
[1:38:15] i don't want to have to find the best
[1:38:17] church that teaches it just right so
[1:38:19] that i know i'm safe and will make it in
[1:38:20] the rapture
[1:38:21] friends god will never let there be a
[1:38:22] perfect church that always teaches it
[1:38:24] right
[1:38:24] he will allow error he will allow me to
[1:38:27] get it wrong
[1:38:28] just so you cannot rest
[1:38:32] i'm telling your friends this is why he
[1:38:34] uses human beings do you think me
[1:38:36] or any of the other brothers here are
[1:38:38] always going to say everything right
[1:38:40] i don't even reference the right
[1:38:41] scriptures and have you turned to the
[1:38:42] right place in the bible
[1:38:46] not not in preaching error that's not
[1:38:48] what we're talking about
[1:38:49] but you cannot say they got it right
[1:38:52] i'll go over here
[1:38:53] i'm right god's not going to let that
[1:38:55] happen friends he's going to make sure
[1:38:57] the only place of safety is
[1:38:58] in christ amen with the veil taken away
[1:39:01] with my own revelation
[1:39:02] so i see it myself
[1:39:07] well you know i'm not so sure about this
[1:39:09] i'm going to find another church and
[1:39:10] this church is right there's no right
[1:39:12] church god doesn't want a right church
[1:39:15] you see what i mean i don't mean every
[1:39:16] church is in error that's not what i'm
[1:39:18] talking about but god doesn't want the
[1:39:20] church to be so right you can't be wrong
[1:39:22] amen god will leave something there amen
[1:39:25] so that
[1:39:26] everybody's got to take the same journey
[1:39:28] and they've got to rapture off of this
[1:39:30] earth and out of their mind
[1:39:31] into the mind of christ and catch the
[1:39:33] revelation themselves and say i know the
[1:39:35] truth and i know who i
[1:39:36] am i know who christ is in this day
[1:39:40] and i'm not looking for safety quotes in
[1:39:42] a quote book and put together right
[1:39:43] and somebody else to put the puzzle
[1:39:45] together for me so that i can stand on
[1:39:47] the puzzle and say i got the picture
[1:39:49] what's going to happen if somebody comes
[1:39:51] along and shuffles your puzzle pieces up
[1:39:53] you got to go back to the same preacher
[1:39:55] put it together to you for you the first
[1:39:56] time
[1:39:56] to put it back together but if you ever
[1:39:59] catch the vision that's on the outside
[1:40:00] of the box
[1:40:01] if somebody comes and stirs up your
[1:40:03] puzzle you can put it back together
[1:40:06] yourself
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:12] what about if somebody's preaching and
[1:40:13] they take your puzzle piece and say it
[1:40:15] goes right here
[1:40:16] and watch them while they're preaching
[1:40:18] just
[1:40:20] and you know it's not fitting
[1:40:26] i'm preaching to real people right
[1:40:30] and you're watching this guy he's
[1:40:32] preaching he's wiggling his puzzle feed
[1:40:33] back and forth
[1:40:36] and your heart's saying i know that'll
[1:40:39] fit there
[1:40:42] see when you've caught the vision
[1:40:44] yourself when you've seen the picture on
[1:40:46] the outside of the box
[1:40:50] you don't even get mad at that guy when
[1:40:53] he's done
[1:40:53] and he leaves you just go over and you
[1:40:55] pick up that piece and you put it over
[1:40:56] there
[1:41:01] why because you went the same place
[1:41:03] brother branham
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:07] god's going to allow all of us to have
[1:41:10] different pictures in different places
[1:41:12] and different understanding of different
[1:41:14] quotes and different scriptures
[1:41:17] why so none of us lean on one another
[1:41:21] so that we all are required to take the
[1:41:23] same trip
[1:41:25] off the earth into the mind of christ
[1:41:28] to catch the revelation of the white
[1:41:29] stone
[1:41:31] so that we can come back down and
[1:41:33] everything's fine with me
[1:41:36] well i think it means that that's okay
[1:41:37] i'm fine with that
[1:41:39] i don't have to shoot you
[1:41:44] i don't have to be angry at you because
[1:41:46] you think this means that and you think
[1:41:48] this is that and this is time for this
[1:41:49] and not time
[1:41:50] that's fine but he showed me
[1:41:54] and this is the way i see it and i'm
[1:41:57] okay with that
[1:41:59] and i'm okay with the fact that he's
[1:42:01] still showing me
[1:42:03] and the picture keeps getting clear and
[1:42:05] clear and clear
[1:42:06] and i'm okay with that i'm okay with it
[1:42:08] getting clear for you
[1:42:09] and i'm okay with it getting clear for
[1:42:11] me
[1:42:13] why because i took my own trip to the
[1:42:15] top of the mountain
[1:42:17] i didn't have to come down and take
[1:42:19] moses's quote book
[1:42:22] and try my hardest to understand it
[1:42:26] and shoot everybody else who had a
[1:42:27] different understanding
[1:42:31] i went up there myself said oh
[1:42:34] now i know what moses is talking about
[1:42:38] paul went himself and when paul went
[1:42:40] himself he didn't need to be a pharisee
[1:42:42] of the pharisees anymore
[1:42:44] he didn't need to be taught in the best
[1:42:45] school of gamaliel to feel secure
[1:42:47] anymore
[1:42:48] he counted all of that as dung
[1:42:51] he cast it all behind him and he moved
[1:42:53] forward why
[1:42:54] because now he experienced the same
[1:42:56] thing moses experienced on the top of
[1:42:58] that mountain he met
[1:42:59] god himself and realized who he was in
[1:43:02] that day
[1:43:02] and he was able to throw away all the
[1:43:04] security of being a pharisee
[1:43:06] all the security of being taught by
[1:43:07] gamalia and now he had the security
[1:43:10] of the revelation of jesus christ in his
[1:43:13] day
[1:43:13] and if you want a security for the bride
[1:43:15] in this day her security is the
[1:43:17] revelation of jesus christ in this day
[1:43:21] and with that secure in our hearts
[1:43:24] everything else is fine
[1:43:27] i believe it this way that's okay
[1:43:29] brother do you see it that way i don't
[1:43:31] see it that way but that's okay
[1:43:33] because i'm so happy with what i see i
[1:43:36] don't need you to see what i see to make
[1:43:38] me happy i'm happy anyways
[1:43:43] do you understand what's the secret
[1:43:47] when you hear the long blast climb to
[1:43:50] the top of the mountain
[1:43:54] is it risky yeah you know why
[1:43:57] because you'll see something nobody else
[1:43:59] sees
[1:44:01] and you'll say something out of the word
[1:44:03] nobody else has ever said before
[1:44:06] and what's going to happen the first
[1:44:08] time you say something nobody else has
[1:44:09] said before
[1:44:10] a pharisee will pick up a rock
[1:44:15] and say that's not what brother branham
[1:44:16] taught
[1:44:19] trust me it'll happen
[1:44:24] i don't want to be a pharisee i don't
[1:44:27] want to be a sadducee
[1:44:29] i want to be a son of god who's made my
[1:44:33] own journey to
[1:44:34] the top of the mountain and went in the
[1:44:36] presence of the consuming fire
[1:44:38] and let him undress me
[1:44:41] and slay me and raise me back up
[1:44:46] and that he can give me the revelation
[1:44:48] that i need for the journey i'm in now
[1:44:51] and he can take the scripture and reveal
[1:44:54] it to me in a way
[1:44:55] that i've never heard anybody else talk
[1:44:57] about or anybody else teach about
[1:44:59] and i can be happy with that are you
[1:45:02] happy with that
[1:45:03] amen god bless you let's stand
[1:45:09] praise be to god musicians if you make
[1:45:11] your way up
[1:45:16] well i made a powerpoint we never got to
[1:45:19] it
[1:45:21] i like it that way i pray god made a
[1:45:24] power point
[1:45:25] in our hearts don't be afraid of
[1:45:29] revelation
[1:45:31] don't be afraid you know there's so much
[1:45:34] confusion out there
[1:45:36] they're saying this and they're saying
[1:45:38] this and they say the thunders mean this
[1:45:41] and
[1:45:41] somebody else says you know bright age
[1:45:43] or seven later seeing age and
[1:45:45] confusion confusion confusion
[1:45:49] i'll tell you the cure for the confusion
[1:45:53] get away from the base of the mountain
[1:45:56] and start climbing to the consuming fire
[1:46:00] get to the scary part where was it that
[1:46:03] moses went when he climbed that mountain
[1:46:05] when they said we can't go you go
[1:46:06] he went in to the blackness and darkness
[1:46:13] what is the blackness in darkness it's
[1:46:15] the deep
[1:46:16] mysteries of the word of god
[1:46:19] and everybody's so afraid that if you go
[1:46:21] into that blackness in darkness you'll
[1:46:23] lose your way
[1:46:24] but i'd like to say the only place to
[1:46:27] find your way
[1:46:28] is in the blackness and darkness of the
[1:46:30] mysteries of god
[1:46:32] that is where at the top of the mountain
[1:46:35] cloaked in darkness only the people who
[1:46:38] go to him
[1:46:39] see what's in the darkness we stay at
[1:46:42] the base
[1:46:43] we never see it what happens
[1:46:47] i saw somebody else go that way and they
[1:46:48] never come back
[1:46:51] what's that got to do with me
[1:46:54] they got off on this thing they got off
[1:46:56] on that tangent
[1:46:58] when you hear the long blast come up
[1:47:01] into the mountain
[1:47:03] we've heard the long blast of the
[1:47:05] seventh unders calling us
[1:47:07] up let's go up into him
[1:47:11] and let him take the veil off of our
[1:47:14] hearts
[1:47:15] and let our bibles keep becoming a new
[1:47:18] book
[1:47:19] let's pray lord jesus we thank you

[1:47:25] our hearts you know our weaknesses and
[1:47:27] our failures
