[0:00] Amen. I'm so thankful that God's called
[0:02] me to be a calf of the stall.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Not a wandering, aimless, needy,
[0:10] starving. Hey, listen. Remember remember
[0:12] uh Pharaoh's dream when Joseph was in
[0:14] captivity and Pharaoh had a dream that
[0:16] none of the wise men could tell him. And
[0:17] he saw seven fat kind cows.
[0:23] Seven fat and healthy. Fat was the word
[0:25] for healthy.
[0:27] And and and then coming up out of the
[0:30] river was was seven spindly Amen. weak.
[0:34] Amen. Uh uh uh uh uh emaciated cattle.
[0:38] And the seven emaciated cattle ate the
[0:41] fat cattle. And he he wanted an
[0:43] interpretation for the dream and didn't
[0:44] have it. But but then Joseph come along
[0:47] and Joseph said, "This is the
[0:48] interpretation. You're going to have
[0:49] seven good years of harvest where you
[0:52] got good food and have plenty." That's
[0:54] what the seven fat kind represented. But
[0:56] then you're going to have seven years of
[0:57] famine. And the seven years of famine
[0:59] are going to eat up the seven good years
[1:00] because all those skinny cows ate the
[1:02] fat cows.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; And after they ate the fat cows, they
[1:05] were just as skinny as ever.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09] &gt;&gt; It didn't help them any
[1:11] &gt;&gt; and everything would be lost. But what
[1:14] was his advice? His advice was store up
[1:17] the grain in the good years. Amen. To
[1:20] sustain you through the bad years. Amen.
[1:22] That's what God told Brother Brandham to
[1:23] do. Store up these vegetables. You're
[1:25] going to need it in the future. Amen.
[1:27] Our Joseph is Christ. Amen. And he's the
[1:30] one who controls the grain. And now in
[1:32] that day when you go to get grain, you
[1:34] had to go to Joseph. And Joseph is
[1:36] Christ. And Joseph is sitting on the
[1:39] grainery. And he's GOT ALL THE GRAIN.
[1:41] AMEN. OF THE SEVEN CHURCHES, ALL THE
[1:43] ORIGINAL teaching of the seven thunders.
[1:45] AND HE'S READY TO DISH IT OUT TO WHOEVER
[1:47] will come to him to receive it.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; And remember his brethren tried to come
[1:52] and buy it. AMEN. HE WOULD SELL IT TO
[1:54] EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT EVERY TIME HIS
[1:56] BRETHREN TRIED TO BUY IT, HE PUT THEIR
[1:57] MONEY BACK in their sack. HE SAID,
[1:59] "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR THIS. THIS
[2:00] IS FREE FOR YOU." And then he said, "YOU
[2:02] COME DOWN TO GOAN. I'M GOING TO FEED
[2:04] YOU. I'M GOING TO SUSTAIN YOU. I'M GOING
[2:07] TO keep you healthy." OH, PRAISE GOD.
[2:09] JOSEPH HAS BROUGHT US INTO GO AND HE HAS
[2:12] THE STOREHOUSE and he's sustaining us.
[2:14] He's keeping us. He's feeding us out of
[2:16] the grainery. Amen. Amen.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Just eat
[2:23] &gt;&gt; and live, my friends.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Eat and have life and strength and
[2:28] vitality and be all that we're supposed
[2:30] to be by eating the message. All our
[2:32] efforts are going to fail. All of our
[2:34] attempts, all of our trying, it'll come
[2:36] to not. But if we just keep eating the
[2:39] word, the word will produce its own
[2:41] life. It'll bring it'll bring life out
[2:44] of the seed that's in the soul. Amen.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Just keep eating, receiving, and it'll
[2:50] become all it was meant to be.
