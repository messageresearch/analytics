we're so thankful you brought us together for this evening that we might come together Lord and gather around the revealed word of the hour which we know is you revealing yourself to us your bride God I pray that you'd give us the isav this evening as we listen to the preaching lord of the word I pray that you would give us the isav that would clear all the crusted away Lord that would remove anything that would inhibit us Lord that we might see clearly what it is you want us to see in this hour I pray God that you would bless us Lord that we'd walk out of here Lord with a Clear Vision we'd walk out of here Lord excited about what you're doing and singing your praises and glorifying your name take each one of us in your control Lord and mold us Lord into your image and make of us Lord what you've predetermined for us to be in this end time we love you we ask you to bless us Lord tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen may God bless you you can have your seats for a little while thank you musicians God bless you as you know we're going to uh start our tape service every winter we like to uh do a tape together we do at least one in a year there's been years we've done more than one and uh a few Wednesdays back we got to listen to the life story brother brandom and I certainly enjoyed that there's something really special about listening together we listen to tapes all the time and we read books all the time but there's something about an atmosphere that you just can't change and and it's so exciting to come together to be in this atmosphere of worship and to listen to The Prophet's voice together for we know that that mouthpiece with the mouthpiece God used to bring the message in the end time and we thank God for that um I want to pull up the PowerPoint and we'll get started with this uh I want to do just a little bit of review every year when we go through this we come to this time we've always got new people who have been added amongst us in Fellowship so I want to do just a little bit of review for their sake and we always got youngsters coming up and now now the those who are starting to get older their light bulbs are coming on and they're starting to get interested in other things and and we always want to review for their sakes as well and so if you if you know about I think it been about 7 years ago the trustees hung this rack they built it brother Elmer built it for us and they hung it in the in the out in the for you here as you go out the doors and on this rack there's uh 12 spots for books the the top section never changes it's the same set of six books that hasn't changed in seven years and there's a reason for that these are the titles on that top section the spoken word is the Original Seed the present stage of my Ministry is this the sign of the end sir the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals the seventh seal and Christ is the mystery of God revealed the reason we leave those up there all the time is because back when we first put the rack up I asked everybody in the church to read through these six titles and read through them in this order because if you watch this order it takes you from it takes you from 1962 all the way to July of 1963 and if you follow those sermons through you see the transition in brother bram's Ministry and you see amen him move into that that what God called him for to be the seventh Church age messenger and to fulfill Mal Revelation 10 1:7 and so it's a very very important transition and so that's why we have those titles so if if you're new or if you're a young person or you're here fellow shipping you've never read through those one by one in that order I encourage you to do so it's uh it's very encouraging to do so it's very eye openening to to go through that in that order and if you haven't done it for 7 years it might be a good idea to do it again amen I love it I love doing that and then on the bottom rack on the bottom section of this rack we have six titles that change every so often periodically they changed for the next few months they're going to remain the same because every year I get six new titles to fill this so we've ordered six new titles brother uh John pittsenbarger helps me and he's ordered the books and and put them in there and those in the library keep them full so for several months we'll have six new titles this will be the new titles the restoration of the brid tree wisdom versus Faith the flashing red light of his coming the Third Exodus Harvest Time and Easter seal now like I've said several times I encourage everyone to get these books it's been interesting now over the last six or seven years however long it's been we've been we've been bringing these titles in every year we bring in more and it's amazing if you've been here from the beginning and followed along you now have a nice library of these message books all of your own so if you're a young person who started years ago now every young person in the church and every young adult has their own library of message books but remember I made a stipulation I have a request I request that you only take one or two at a time don't go get all six new ones we'll keep it full we'll make sure we order as long as voice of God has them we'll order them you're not going to run out but just take one or two and when you're done reading those get one or two more when you're done reading those get one or or two more cuz the problem is if you go and grab 10 titles you may have a title in there for two or three years that you never read but now if you do it this way by the time you can look over at at your bookshelf and you've read every title every book you've had you've read yourself I think that's Paramount and now as we add these six new titles we now have 53 titles that we keep here all the time in the library so by the grace of God we built that from year to year uh and so we know that there's an electronic form of everything you can go on the uh on the website and listen you can download on your phone tablets computer there's a there's a myriad of ways to listen to the message and to read it but there's something about a book I like a book and so I'm happy that we're still able to have them and still able to have them here for anybody who would like to have one as well all the rest of those titles are in the library so if you walk in the door this is the the shelving uh system right there in front of you you to the right uh all the books are there and if you turn around look behind the door there's been some more added to this since this picture and that's where you'll find all those titles that aren't out on the rack so if you're looking for a book we've got 53 titles here hopefully we've got something that you're looking for and that you can have you're also welcome to take these anytime along with anything else in the library if you want to share a book with somebody you want to share it with a friend a coworker somebody you're witnessing to or somebody that you know just would benefit from that feel free to grab one and just give it to them that we don't we don't uh we don't sell anything out of the library it's just there for you to take take the book witness pass it out use it amen all the funds for these books come from the general fund so if you want to make a contribution if you take several books just drop it in the offering in the general fund and that'll cover it but we want there there's no it's no good having thousands of books sit on a shelf they're there to be read to be fed upon so that we all can grow so we have them there to be used so take advantage of that uh so tonight we're going to go into the Masterpiece this is actually a book that we got several years ago we've had the book here for a while but we've never used it in a tape service so we're going to go through the Masterpiece if everybody who has a book grab your book we're going to we're going to look at this book now um uh the deacons told me that we ran out of books and I'm very sorry for that but uh brother John said he can have some here by next Wednesday so if you weren't able to grab a book we will have physical books here uh by next Wednesday so that everybody can have one so if you look at the front of the book it's got the title which is the Masterpiece up in the upper leftand corner it says 64705 that means this was preached in 1964 July 5th 0705 July 5th 1964 I as I say every year I'm going to repeat myself for many of you but for some this will be new first time that you hear this whenever I grab a book and pick it up I don't just want to just grab and start reading but I want to know where this is placed in the sequence of events where it falls into the timeline of the message is this pre seals is this during the first pool or second pool or after the third pool is where where are we at where is brother brandom at in his ministry and what is he trying what what is God trying to tell me in this book I just don't want to read it so I can check it off my list I've checked that book off and read it now I can put it on my shelf but I want to know what God's trying to tell me in this message and so then we look at the title the title is the Masterpiece and I hold that in my heart the whole time I'm reading this book and in my mind because that's what brother brandom is preaching about the Masterpiece and if you look at the title it says the Masterpiece it doesn't say the masterpieces it's singular the masterpiece piece and it's important that you grab this and hold this in your mind because you know that he's going to be talking to about more than one image one more than one H uh I don't know how to say so I don't want to spill the beans but the the Masterpiece isn't just one vessel but he shows that there's more than one vessel in the Masterpiece but it's still one Masterpiece one work of art that he's working on so that's important so if we open up the just turn the cover you have the cover page turn that one once more and look on the inside onto the left and once again you'll have the title The Masterpiece you have the date then also it'll it'll say here that this message by Brother William BR Mariam brandham was delivered on Sunday morning July 5th 1964 at branam Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana USA the tape number 64705 is 2 hours and 18 minutes so I always look at this I always flip it open and look at this because I want to know also where he preached it because many times brother bham will use terminology and he will use phrases to relate to the people he's preaching to is he at a Full Gospel businessman association meeting is a Pentecostal church is he in a big Gathering of different churches is where where is he at or is he at his home Church in Jeffersonville and many times you'll notice that brother Brenham will tailor his message and use certain terminology and phrases to relate to the people that he's preaching to so I always want to know where he's preaching it where it falls in the timeline of the ministry where it's at and it's always nice to know how long it is amen so it's going to take us three services to get through uh today will just be an introduction we'll get just we'll just start getting into the meat of it and then we'll have to stop but it'll lay a foundation so they come along the next two times and and really pour into it and pour over it um see what else I want to say we are going to begin at page one paragraph one we're going to listen to the tape in its entirety and we're going to go to page to the bottom of page 11 all the way to the very last word in page 11 is where we're the what we hope to cover today and what we intend to cover today all right let me see here if there's anything else I want to cover okay I'm going to go over questions now uh those of you are new our our habit here our tradition and custom here is that I will ask questions and I'm I'm going to ask four questions here and those questions brother Brenham will answer in the segment that we're going to listen to they're not trick questions they're not they're not there to stumble you it it's just a a question I'm going to ask the question and as we follow through and the reason I initially started doing this is really for the young people who just started feeding on the message themselves I want them to learn how to get the answers to the questions out of the message I want them to to know learn how to feed not to read like we're reading a newspaper but really feed on what God is telling us and really take it in and let it shape our understanding and let it reveal to us the word of God and so I'm going to ask these questions and we'll all be listening carefully and even you youngsters you those of you are Sunday school age amen you can answer these questions too and you might find the answer faster than mom or dad so you might just win so that'll be good you'll have bragging rights when you get home tonight so let's go to the questions now question number one where did Michelangelo get the image of Moses where did he get the image of Moses the one he used to make the Masterpiece where did Michelangelo get the image of Moses number two why did he strike the sculpture why did he strike the sculpture some of you you've listened to several times you you already know the answer but hey praise the Lord thank God we can hear it again amen number three what made it a masterpiece to brother brandham what was it that made it a masterpiece to brother brandham and number four what was wrong with God's first Masterpiece that's an odd question I'm not saying that it was wrong but you'll understand as we get into the message I didn't know how else to word it what was wrong with God's first masterpiece all right many of you remember that there's been um a few times here that we've read through uh and listened to or read through a private interview that brother bandham did and I just used it I don't know maybe a month ago or month and a half ago in services and it's the private interview with sister Bruce sister uh Georgia Bruce I believe or yeah I believe that's her name and sister Bruce and it's about she has a questions about uh having the baptism of Holy Ghost and she needs healing for her heart if you'll remember that and and so sister Bruce actually met brother brandom in his office right before he came out to preach this message and he's going to refer to that so it's really interesting to know what brother Brenham said in that private interview because you're going to hear what he says he'll say I just had that on a private interview a little bit ago a Godly little sister had this question and he's going to talk to the congregation about it and it's really nice to know who that is and what he said to her in the private interview and it makes it gives you so much uh more depth of understanding when you hear him say it so he's going to reference it right here in the beginning as he's greeting the people and talking to the people and so that's who he's referring to Sister Bruce it's the it's the private interview that we have on tape and that was her question she needed to be healed but her her main question was that she had never had uh an experience of being baptized in the Holy Ghost that she could put her foot on and brother brandom helped her find the one she could put her foot on Amen praise God all right uh let's all stand together and let's read the scripture that brother Bam's going to open with in Isaiah 53 I like to do this because as we're going through our book and have our Books open and our pens and all of these things taking notes sometimes it's hard to flip open your Bible and the text is in the uh Masterpiece book but I'd like for us to see it in our Bibles as we begin so Isaiah 53 and this is Brother benham's this is the scripture he's going to open with and use for the uh context Isaiah chap 53 verse 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he ha no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from the prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in death in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him Heath put Heath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because Heath poured out his soul unto death and he has number and he was numbered with the transgressors and he Beed the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors what an opening scripture for the Masterpiece a work of art God bless you as you take your seats Amen brother Franco if you can bring up the Masterpiece we'll begin on page one paragraph 1 let's bow our heads now for prayer while our heads and hearts are bowed before God I I wonder how many in here has a request that they'd like God to remember but just lifting up your hand now hold your request in your heart now as we pray Lord Jesus th the the fountain an exhaustible Fountain of Life flow through us today Lord and cleanse us from all unbelief all sin that we might stand in thy presence now Hallelujah knowing that there is need Among Us that we know that we are sinners and not not worthy of any blessing but then when we think of him who came and took our sins then when his blood's there it's not it's not us in the presence of God it's him just our Voice through his blood is blood speaking oh God then cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief give to us the desires of our heart or we truly have these desires to serve you and in these weakening conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put up on us sometime to perfect us we've been told that that he said think it not strange that these trials come they're only working out for our good and to perfect us and bring us into that place these great deserts of experience or a righteous man are molded into Saints yes we we thank thee for these experiences Lord we would no mean no wise want to uh do anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this we be brought closer to you and when the burdens are so heavy we can't go no farther than we raise our hands and scream to our father then hear from Heaven Lord heal us make us well for the kingdom of God's sake bless Thy word this morning Lord Thy word is the truth we've assembled here now in the church we pray for brother Neville and for brother caps and brother Collins and all the rest of the ministers and the and the trustees deacons and all the leoty and the strangers in our gates oh God may this be a day that we long remember because of your presence we're here under great expectation this morning Lord just momentarily notice called together we feel that it's for our purpose may your purpose be achieved Lord for we ask it in Jesus name as we submit ourselves amen glory to God it's Grand to be here and to uh be assembled with this church full of people I wasn't expecting to be hardly anyone here this morning because I didn't hardly know myself I was going to be here we just got in from Philadelphia and so I come in thinking I was going to have to go to Arizona right quick for have a funeral service for a friend of mine uh a uh Captain Jim Mosley a very precious Godly boy led to Christ not long ago three Mosley brothers and um one of them fell was in the plane the other day and was killed instantly lady to fire for 10 hours before they got to him so Lee is 28 years old his wife 26 and and leave three little children the oldest seven very sad and uh they when they got him in then they had to bring him the next day so I just I didn't get to go and I just wrote out or sent a telegram what I was going to say what I would have said at brother Mosley's funeral and some these things we can't understand but yet uh he makes everything work just right right we are here in service of the Lord this morning knowing that that that we believe God that we believe that he'll make everything just exactly right regardless of what it is and how it works out we know it's got to work for good he promise that it's just got to be that way sometimes we can't understand that gets very complicated at times but yet we know it is the truth because the Bible says it's a truth and the Bible to us is God and letter form amen now we got to place our faith somewhere and if if I or any of us in life tried to make a success in life and become many times a multi-millionaire but what do we going to do with that we got to come down at the end of the road and what what good is it to us thing and money is a a script it's an exchange but you can't exchange it for life only God has life so we we realize that we're here in a netive form and as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive see because it's because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or it to strike the Light Strike that lens or there wouldn't be any any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflected something here on Earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't I'm the worst deceived man in the world I spent my life in vain but I know beyond a shadow of doubt that it's there that's why we're here when I see you people come across the country on a few moments noce and sometime presuming then it makes me feel real little when I come into a meeting like this to think that I know people here travel for hundreds of miles just to be here for a few minutes of service just to set here some woman just made a remark come in the other day and said show me where the man is walking let me walk behind him upon the ground so I'll get well now if people believes you like that and you're representative of Christ then what should we do we should be very careful because you're not only destroying yourself as wrong you're destroying others who are following you so I know no denomination or nothing to take you to the only one thing I had my my faith and if you believe me follow what I tell you because I believe the Bible That's the word of godall other things fail glory amen um he is life he is the word now I know that you when I come here I keep you long I prayed to God when I felt like I want to come here today I've had so many interviews and calls and so forth I had to meet some of them this morning and I said 'w brother Neville no doubt asked me to speak and that was Friday and I said brother Neville will probably ask me to speak and when I do then I pray God so hot been so hot and he was good to send us the rain and break the real extreme heat give us a good morning this morning I pray that his goodness will shower each one of you all that you'll ever remember being here this morning may his grace and blessings be upon you let not to visit a friend sick brother Bill da I don't see him here this morning somehow oh here he is he's yeah I thinking an old man of 901 years old and still storing across the the country through the deserts and over the snowy mountains and slick roads you don't have to do that God has been good to him you don't have to do that he could sit home and have servant of fan if he wanted to but something happened to build out he was born again and when it was something come into his heart that all he lives for is to attend these services and then if I'm to be the mouthpiece of God would I deceive a friend I'd rather die and let me tell him exactly what's the truth out of this Bible then that's God's word I'm just repeating what he said now I want to read some out of the Bible before we U read I i' like to to say that I believe tonight is a communion night and uh you who are here locally of course the other people will probably be going back to their homes CU they have to go to work you who are locally here in the assembly remember the brother will be giv communion tonight now I'm waiting for a a the final call for Africa uh they would won't let me in as a missionary so the only way I can go in uh down I'm going to Kenya Uganda and tanzan and the only way I can go in first the churches won't let you in cuz they want me to preach something on this side and that side down in Africa I won't go in like that I wouldn't be hypocrite enough to do that so I either tell no sir I'll just preach just what God puts on my heart and that's all see and I'm sure it won't be what they're trying to get me to teach so uh Triune baptisms and so forth like that and fussing with him no but I've been asked to a big convention by Brother Bose just on the verge of coming to seeing some daylight of what we believe and so uh I've asked to come in like I was going on a hunting trip if they let me in like going in hunting if I get somebody say they take me hunting then when I get in there the doctor the doctor's there at the ambassy is a personal friend of mine out of Chicago and as soon as I get in there he say well here's brother Ren over here let's have a meeting so I there the ambassy can't turn me down if a so they're trying to work it through now so I trust that it if it's God's will it'll work out that way see if it's just committed to him if not then I'll notify you I want if it be the will of God then I want to speak on the seven trumpets and that'll be about an 8 day service and we won't be here at the Tabernacle perhaps we try to get an auditorium here I never thought of this new Auditorium just being built up here it's exactly where I saw Jesus the first time in Vision out it's aor built right over the same spot I went right there to the day to L when I looked and see him looking towards the east you remember hearing me tell it when I was out there praying for my father um a little boy it's a boy preacher that's where I saw him stepped looking at him he had his head turned sideways from me I kept walking around clearing my throat in a broom Sage field I kept watching and he never turn I called his name Jesus and he turned around held his arms out and that's all I remembered until daylight and so I come back out of the field on towards daylight so maybe the Lord let me preach those trumpets there wherever it is God's will be done turn in your Bibles now uh to Isaiah the 50 um 53rd chapter of Isaiah now we trust that God will bless our feeble efforts of coming together this morning we just come down from Philadelphia where is at the Full Gospel businessman's convention and um listening to their different testimonies and so forth up there then I on the road down I was Billy Paul and I and Rebecca and little Collins girl little Betty Collins and Billy is a very good sleeper and Becky's better and so uh Betty and I talked and she was sitting back with Becky in the back seat and uh I seen something on the road happen and when I did something struck me and Betty if she's here she noticed I quit talking started writing something down that's where I got this text for this morning now let us stand to our feet if [Music] we how we stand in honor of God's word as I read Isaiah the 53rd chapter who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed notice it's a question to begin with for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and has a root out of dry ground he has no Farm nor commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrow acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our grief and has carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the Chast of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed all we like sheep have gone astray we've turned everyone to his own way and the lord has laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people he was stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he has done no violence neither was there deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall seiz seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand and he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall many righteous servants be justified many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore I will divide him a portion with the great and shall divide the spars with the strong because he has poured out his soul unto to death and was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sins of many and made intercessions for the transgressors father God Thy word is a lamp uh the light that lights the path of every believer into the presence of God as it carries us like a lantern in our hand You' have not provided enough that we should see the end from the beginning and but walk with faith but as a man would travel through a dark forest at night and that's where we are the light that he holds only provides step by step but the path though leading upward just walk with the light and may the light shine today upon the word to lead us one step further to the kingdom of God for we ask it in Jesus name amen the subject that I feel to speak to the congregation today is the Masterpiece it may seem rather strange to take a a scripture reading like this of a of one of the most bruised and mous of pictures of the Bible that when the Bible says that this perfect servant that was afflicted and bruised and torn and yet take a text from that as Masterpiece very strange but I'm my mind is thinking this morning as uh we journey back I do for a few years I was in invited up to far Sal and and California above Los Angeles my first purpose for going up there was to visit the the grave of of Amy simple mcferson the founder of the four square movement and I went to her her tomb and uh although I I differ with the woman as a minister but yet I in my heart I give admiration and respect for for what she stood for and the the hour and the persecution things she had to go through with and um in time of her being here on the earth and then for her her beloved Son which is a bosom friend of mine Roth mcferson and a group of ministers we went up there and they we didn't have time to go in uh to the uh into the the the place where they have the cremation and put the the bodies in a a little box on the side of the wall and in there they have some outstanding uh things such as the last supper and it's lighted by the actual light of the Sun and they have a shutter that it gives them when they go in it's light and then as as they begin to speak it darkens up and after a while it all becomes dark and then the people go out and they have all the supper and the woman that helped the secret of how to beat this glass into this place while I make these pictures while they come to a family for many years back and the art was just give to the children and the last one was a woman and there was uh fixing this picture and uh when you went to mold and burn the the glass BAC it of Judas iscar it busted so then they tried it again and it busted again and she said maybe our Lord doesn't want his enemy picture by his side and said if it burst again we'll not complete the picture but it help that time then of course that was a striking thing in how that such things would happen but then one of the main things that interest me in forlon was Michelangelo's uh the great sculpture the the Monument of Moses it's a A reproduction there of course it isn't the original but it was such a a Great Masterpiece and as I stood and looked at I I like that something it looks like it's represents got something to it I like art real well I believe God is in art I believe God is in music I believe God is in nature God's everywhere and anything that's contrary to the original is a perversion God is in dancing not the kind of dancing you do here but when the Sons and Daughters of God are in the spirit of God and that's dancing but uh like I had to contend with at 2:00 this morning up there in the lane uh that's the perversion of it but this masterpiece that Michelangelo had had made it uh it cost him something to do that that he was a great man and it cost a big part of his life because he was many many years and carving out just take a rock and a Marvel and keep carving it and to see only the man the sculpture himself has in his mind what he's trying to do he he's the one you might walk up and say to him what are you pecking on that rock for to The Outsider who doesn't know what's in his heart uh it's nonsense but the the man the sculpture himself he he's got a A Vision in his mind what he's trying to make and he's trying to reproduce what he has on his mind in the form of a of a monument that's reason he's digging it out all the rocks and this to do you have to start off right at the beginning and you have to follow the pattern see you can't get a little piece start off we'll make it this way no I believe no he's got to have a exact pattern and in his mind he's got that pattern and he cannot vary from that pattern now in order to do this he had to draw in his mind because we have no real pictures of Moses but he had to get a mental picture in his mind of exactly what Moses was now a genuine sculpture is inspired like a genuine poet or any genuine singer musician whatever it might be all real has to come by inspiration Michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what Moses really looked like and he caught it in his mind what Moses must have been so he set forth on this great piece of marble The Cutting to the pattern and bringing down and honing down uh to he got to the real picture of what uh uh it must have been in his mind and then when he got all so perfect every corner off and every place rubbed and the eyes just right every hair and beard all just the way it was you he stood off and looked at it I I think of of many many hard years of Labor and how he had to hold that same vision all the time in his mind of what he was going to do and this think that Vision on his mind for so many years to make it look just exactly to what it was he caught the vision first and how he had to work to that Vision cutting off and making down and when he got it to where he perfected it till it really got perfect he stood and looked at it when he finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand and he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision of his mind was standing before him in reality what he had seen and his conception of What mo Moses was there was figured before him what he had in his heart all these years and toils and hours of sorrow and distress and critics and everything else but yet he stayed right with the vision until it was completed and then when it was completed he stood back with the hammer sculptures hammer in his hand and he looked at that monument and the inspiration of the vision that he had seen of how to do it inspired him so much till he the inspiration struck him till he got beside himself and struck it across the knee and said speak now there's a flaw on that great image on the knee on the right knee just above the knee about 6 in is a place I put my hand on it about that deep after he had spent all that time for years and years to make this then under the the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart in his vision and desire to see it was completed and when it was completed he was so inspired by it till he thought his own Masterpiece just speak back to and he struck it across the leg and speak and it made a flaw on it it put a flaw on the image to me the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece now maybe to the the mind that might think different you think that spoiled it no to me it it made it what it was it it it because after so many years of careful work and TOs and inspiration and so forth of making it his Torah had proved not in vain it was perfect and that's why he cried out speak because he' seen before him that he was been able to achieve to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind and therefore under inspiration he done something out of the reason out of the ordinary he struck it and holled speak see he wouldn't have done that if he have thought but he didn't think it was inspiration of seeing what he had in his mind setting there perfectly before him his toils and wearies and long nights and housed away from the world for days and maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it and get back and oh that's just not the way it was I just got to come down to this and rub it and then when he saw it just perfect then he saw in reality the negative of the what was in his mind had become real it become positive therefore it sprung into him it was so real that he must cry out speak to me it was a reflection it was it was a compliment to his work that his own work so inspired him that he would be beside himself to Smite it and say speak I stood there and looked at the monument I thought of the hours that the man must have put and making that they said how many years it was but it it was a reflection to him because it was a contribution to his uh uh to his great art his great work of what he was doing and when he finally was able to achieve it it was so great now let us turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book let's open another book and read of the great sculpture the almighty who before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something and and reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking now to Michelangelo that was an attribute of his thought and God wanted to make a man after his image the great sculpture and he went to work on him and we notice as he brought up from the materials the first perhaps this fishes and then the birds and and then the creeping things upon the Earth and and many things that he brought but finally as he brewed being Creator he had he was like a man now a sculpture that has to take something that's been created a human an image he was the sculpture of Eternal things he was a sculpture that could create and bring into existence that which he has in his mind to do or otherwise he can make material what his attributes desired and as he begin to work upon uh creeping things like upon the the the little animals upon the Earth and then he began to bring it from that into something else higher then finally he brought it into the larger animals such as the lion tiger bear then he brought it into the the the life of maybe of monkeys and apes and so forth now not an evolution as we think that one came from the e that was a complete creation God working in a pattern but finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own in and then I might say to this that uh when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was uh the Eternal and the man now in the image of God also existed on the Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took that piece that struck off of it and made him a helpmate a wife then he wasn't by himself he was uh he was he had somebody with him and uh that's his great work any is any great sculpture would take his uh his his Masterpiece now first he had a masterpiece of himself but now he seen that the Masterpiece was lome like he was so he divided the Masterpiece by striking it in the side and brought forth a helpmate and now to make the two one he put them like any great sculpture in a place that it's beautiful a a sculpture wouldn't make a Great Masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings as our Lord told us a man doesn't lie at a canle and put it under a bushel when we become God's masterpieces we're not hid in an alley somewhere we we must give life so we see that that he actually made this master piece he placed it up here on the earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the Garden of Eden he placed his Masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden how it must have pleased him that he saw this masterpiece was well he after that we find out that he rested he was so well pleased with his work I remember that my opinion the Masterpiece is the stroke that marged St Angelo's uh Moses Masterpiece in the monument and it was a stroke that cut the side of his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see them as a masterpiece family of in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him till he he took rest then he said I I'll rest but while he was resting and trusting to his Masterpiece his enemy uh come in and found this Great Masterpiece and he by deceit he he crawls under the the garden walls and then uh he he mared this beautiful uh Masterpiece he he admired it so that it it fell now I'm trying to watch that clock and I ask Mike my nephew to ring that Bell in 30 minutes but uh uh he's not done it and I've already been 30 minutes but lord it's uh we uh continue on a little bit now I don't want to to break these rules I I made these rules see and I I and here's breaking your own Rule now notice then this masterpiece when Satan got a hold of the deceiver broke through the walls and uh and he mired this masterpiece uh because that the way he did it why how did he do it I'll go more detail of it how he done it was this masterpiece was walled by the word God's word and the Masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by this word but the broken part that was broke off of the original went out beyond that wall and give Satan a chance to Mar and now as you know what I believe on those things so I won't have to say that but the Masterpiece was broke but the great sculpture when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image a man amen praise God see I told you we're just starting to get into the meat of it and we have to stop for tonight but but uh it'll set a good foundation for next time and next time we'll launch into the deep amen when we get we're go into these questions now um we'll get started on that uh and I want to apologize the part where he refers to the interview with sister uh Bruce comes next time sorry I thought it was in this time but it'll be next time so maybe I'll remind you of that again next time all right the first question that we had was why did Michelangelo where where did Michelangelo get the image of Moses so let's turn to um and look at paragraph 33 which will be at the bottom of page seven bottom of page seven paragraph 33 says but this and the Masterpiece that Michelangelo had made it cost him something to do that he was a great man and it cost a big part of his life because he was many many years carving out just take a rock and of marble and keep carving it and see that only the man the sculptor himself has in his mind what he's trying to do and he's the one you might walk up to say to him what are you pecking on that rock for to The Outsider he doesn't know what's in his heart it's nonsense but to the man the sculptor himself he's got a vision in his mind that he's trying to make and he's trying to reproduce what he has on his mind and in the form of a monument that's the reason he's digging out of that rock and let's read on a little further and this to do you have to start off right at the beginning and you have to follow the pattern you can't get a little piece to start off and we'll make it this way no I believe no he's got to have an exact pattern and in his mind he's got the pattern and he cannot vary from that pattern now in order to do this he had to draw in his mind because we have no real pictures of Moses but he had to get the mental picture in his mind of exactly what Moses was now a genuine sculptor is inspired like a genuine poet or any genuine singer musician whatever it might be all real has to come by inspiration Michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what Moses really looked like and he caught it in his mind what Moses must have been so he set forth in his great piece of marble The Cutting to the pattern and bringing down and honing down until he got to the real picture of what it must have been in his mind so now we know where did where did Michael Ang get this image that he was going to model this this sculpture after it came by inspiration and it came as an image by inspiration in his mind of what Moses looked like it's important brother Brandon he's trying to show us a type he's using this as a type so if we go to paragraph 44 at the bottom of page nine says now let us turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book and let's open another book and read of the great sculpter the almighty who before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something in reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking so brother renom is just tying the two together and he's showing where did Michelangelo get the image that he was going to make the sculpt the the sculpture of Moses he got it from inspiration from his own mind where did God get the image of the great work he was doing it was in his mind so let's turn back to the beginning here on uh paragraph 33 page 7 bottom of page 7 there's something he says that I just want to reference we'll start right in the middle this paragraph where it says and see and see only the man the sculptor himself has in his mind what he's trying to do he is the one you might walk up and say to him what are you pecking on that rock for to The Outsider who doesn't know what's in his heart it's nonsense but to the man the sculptor himself he's got a vision in his mind of what he's trying to make amen I love that God already has in his mind the image of you and I he knows what he's trying to do with his bride he knows what he's been doing over seven Church ages he knows what it's going to look like at the End Amen and and along the way it may not be clear and we may question why this age and why did this happen and why did this go right and why did this go wrong through the seven Church ages we look at it that way but the sculptor has in his mind by inspiration by a vision he already knows what he's going to produce and every every stroke has the one object in mind to bring it to this conclusion and the same thing in our life God already has a design in his mind for the way we're going to look at the end of our life's journey and we may not understand every stroke and sometimes we've asked God what why why did you do that why the Chisel right there and why so deep why did you cut so deep and why did you knock such a big chunk off but he already has the vision in his mind and every stroke every stroke has that vision in mind and he's working it to one goal and that's so he gets you and I in the image he had of us before the foundation of the world praise God what's so beautiful about that is we have trials we have tribulations we have difficulties but he saw me finished before the foundation of the world there's no fear in me not finishing because the master the master Craftsman the master artist is on the job and he knows how hard to strike where to strike where to polish when to beat and when to rub and there's no chance that I won't come into that image because he's working by inspiration praise God Amen the second question why did he strike the sculpture let's go to paragraph 36 on page 8 page8 let's go to the middle of page8 in paragraph 36 and then when he got to all it all perfect every corner off every place rubbed and the eyes just right every hair and beard and all just the way it was he stood off and looked at it I think of many many hard years of Labor and how he had to hold that same vision all the time in his mind of what he was going to do and just think that Vision in his mind for so many years to make it look just exactly what it was he caught the vision first and how he had to work to that Vision cutting off and making down and when he got to where where the where he perfected it till it really got perfect he stood and looked at it when he finished up there up that morning with a hammer in his hand and he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision of his mind was standing before him in reality what he had seen in his conception of what Moses was there it was figured before him what he had had in his heart all these years and the toils and the hours of sorrow and distress and critics and everything else but he stayed right with the vision until it was completed and then when it was completed he stood back with the hammer the sculptor's hammer in his hand and he looked at the monument and the inspiration of the vision that he had seen of how to do it inspired him so much till the inspiration struck him till he got beside himself and he struck it across the knee and he said speak now there's a flaw on that great image on the knee on the right knee just above the knee about 6 Ines is a place I put my hand on it about that deep and after he had spent all that time for years and years to make this then under the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart and his vision and desired to see it was completed when it was completed he was so inspired by it till he he thought his own Masterpiece should speak back to him and he struck it across the leg and hollered speak and it made a flaw on it it put a flaw on the image man why did he strike it he struck it because he was so inspired that what was in his mind was now in reality that he thought that His Image should speak back to him amen we know God has done the same thing Amen to Jesus Christ he was so inspired by seeing a man completely in His image and the fullness of God that he struck him and he struck him for a purpose and we'll get to that in future question number three what made it the Masterpiece to brother Brandon let's pick it up right here paragraph 40 where we're at to me the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece now maybe to the mind that might think different you think that spoiled it no to me it made it what it was because after so many years of careful work and toils and inspiration and so forth of making it his toil had proved not in vain it was perfect and that's why he cried out speak let's go to paragraph 52 paragraph 52 on page 11 now remember that my opinion the Masterpiece is the stroke that marred St Angelo's Moses Masterpiece in the monument it was the stroke that cut the side of his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see him as a masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him till he took rest and he said I'll rest so what made it the Masterpiece to brother bandam it was the stroke it was a man who was so inspired that he would strike his own creation and and Christ speak and it reminded him of Christ God was so pleased with the image so pleased with with Christ that he would strike a little blow down on his left side and now we think when you see a body that's so perfect and the resurrected Jesus Christ and a scar think oh my there's something so imperfect no that's what makes it the Masterpiece amen when he told Thomas Thomas take take thy finger and thrust it into my hands and take thy hand and thrust it into my side and Thomas said oh my Lord and my God what was it that's what made it the Masterpiece praise God uh question number four what was wrong with God's first Masterpiece let's go to paragraph 45 right here at the bottom of page nine now to Michel Angelo that was an attribute of his thought and God wanted to make a man after his image the great sculptor and he and he went to work on it let's skip down to paragraph 47 but finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and then he he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was and God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image and when I might and I might say to say to this that when he had made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he was by himself that's what was wrong with the Masterpiece there was nothing wrong with the Masterpiece Adam was perfect but to God it didn't look just right because that he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was the Eternal and the man now in the image of God also existed on the Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took the piece that struck off of it and made him a help meat a wife then he wasn't by himself he was uh he he he had somebody with him and that's his great work and he has any great sculptor would take his Masterpiece now first he had a masterpiece of himself but now he's seen that that Masterpiece was lonesome like he was so he divided the Masterpiece by striking it in the side and brought forth a help meat so what was wrong with the Masterpiece the problem was it was alone and that wasn't the finished work of what God had in his mind there was something more cuz remember after God United the two together and set them in the most perfect setting you could set them in the Garden of Eden then he took his rest amen and Michelangelo never took his rest till he was finished and God never took his rest because he was the great Al artist The Great sculptor and he never finished until he would he never rested until he was finished and he wasn't finished until he brought forth the bride now let's look at a couple more places here now let's back up to the bottom of uh paragraph 48 I want to read just the last line he was he had somebody with him and that's his great work so what's his great work is when he struck the man and he pulled out of him the woman and United them together that's his great work now let's go over to paragraph 51 I'm going to pick it up in the second sentence in paragraph 51 he placed his Masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden what was his Masterpiece the two being one all right let's go down to paragraph 52 let's go to the second uh part of paragraph 52 and it was the stroke that cut the side of his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see him as a Masterpiece family in the Garden of Eden What's the Masterpiece a masterpiece family praise God let's go down to paragraph 55 I'm going to pick it up in the second sentence I'll go I'll go in more detail of it how he done it this masterpiece was walled by the word God God's word and the Masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by the word so what's the Masterpiece itself the family so now we get the Masterpiece the title is the Masterpiece not masterpieces am and when God took his Great Masterpiece he saw that there was something not quite right about it because it was by himself like God was by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on the left side and took a piece from that he formed the the second part of the Masterpiece and United together amen and and that was his great work what the two being one and where did he put it he put it in Eden and when he had completed his masterpiece which was a masterpiece family then he could take his rest praise God now let's go down to paragraph 56 but the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruined he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and begin to build again unto his own image a man and that was Jesus Christ and through the Old Testament he built back the man he brought back the last Adam which was Jesus Christ and when Jesus Christ had come and proved that he was a perfect Masterpiece there wasn't a flaw in him he kept all the word he fully obeyed the will of God Amen what did God do he was so pleased with him he smoted him so that he would speak amen and he took from him the the elements necessary to to make a bride what's he been doing he's rebuilding the Masterpiece family he's re rebuilding his great work he's rebuilding what had fallen and what had fallen was not just a man singular what had fallen was the Masterpiece family and so now for 4,000 years he come to the last Adam but then now for the last 2,000 years he's been restoring the last part of the Masterpiece which is the bride and now in this end time he's putting them together in the invisible Union of the bride and what's he going to do he's going to place them again in a beautiful setting and a restoration to Eden once more and what will he do when he places them there he will take his rest because his rest was interrupted by the fall but he will finish his rest cuz God will never be defeated in his purposes so what does that make us part of the Masterpiece not Masterpiece is part of the Masterpiece the image God had in in his mind before the foundation of the world the great work that he's doing to display himself on the earth and we find ourselves part of that work praise be to God I'd like to just if I could just point out a few other things that weren't questions there some things I want to highlight there's so much more when we read a message than just just Doctrine but there's also the life of brother brandham on display and I always love to highlight that and I think we're so privileged as a people to have the life of a prophet on display not just the teaching so in the Bible we have the teachings of the prophets and we have certain aspects of their life and certain things that we see but never before has the life of a prophet been so on display for us to read and so that's that's a benefit we have in the message so let's go to if you could go with me to paragraph 27 at the bottom of page six page six paragraph 27 I'd like to to read this my mind is thinking this morning as we journey back I do for a few years I was invited up to Forest Lawn in California up above Los Angeles my first purpose for going up there was to visit the grave of Amy simple mcferson the founder the four square movement I went to her tomb and although I different with the woman as a minister but yet in my heart I give admiration and respect for what she stood for and the hour and the persecution and things she had to go through with and the time of her being here on the earth I Marvel at this cuz brother brandham does not believe in women preachers he teaches out of the Bible that it's against the word contrary to the word of God it is not the will of God it is not the word of God and is wrong so was Amy simple mcferson wrong for preaching yes she was off the word but yet brother bandham so understands the church ages and then that portion of the word had not come in Clarity she was wrong but yet he respected her for what she stood for and for holding to the truth that she knew and doing all she could and he could have respect and he went to Forest Lawn to honor Amy simple mcferson I say praise God if the prophet of God can do that I can do that amen I can just honor and respect people maybe they're off the word maybe they're wrong and that's fine maybe they'll never understand and they'll never get right but I can respect somebody for doing whatever they can do and whatever portion whatever respect they show and whatever they can they can do and give I just respect them for that what they're blind to they're blind to if I can share it with them I'll share with them I'll tell them the truth but if I can't just thank God that there's those who are trying to do something right so I just love the attitude of the Prophet I think we get a whole lot more than just doctorine we get life the life of Christ on display through our brotherr let's go go all the way back to the first page and look at paragraph three this is in brother brenham's prayer and It just strikes me I love brother brenham's prayers and in paragraph three he says give us give to us the desires of our heart for we truly have these desires to serve you in these weakened conditions and afflictions and things of the world that's put Upon Us sometimes to perfect as we've been told that when he said think it not strange that these trials come they're only working out for our good to perfect us and bring us into the that place these great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into into Saints we thank thee for these experiences Lord we would we would no mean no wise want to do anything contrary to your will but we pray father that in this we'll be brought closer to you and when the burdens are so heavy we can't go no further than we raise our hands and scream to our father then hear from Heaven Lord Heal us make us well for the kingdom of God's sake I just love this prayer brother B he he may have been going through a tough time himself he may have been referring to what others were going through in the in the interviews but he he's telling us in these weakened conditions and afflictions and things that have to be put on us sometime for our Perfection oh God help us in these great deserts of experiences where righteous men are molded we thank thee for these experience he's thanking God for the troubles and then he's saying Lord may it bring us closer to you and then he goes on to say but when it becomes too heavy we can't bear it anymore we just throw our hands and say father scream to our father then you hear from Heaven Lord and heal us and make us well I I love that prayer that's just the way we live isn't it friends that's just the reality Thank God now let's go to paragraph 11 on the next page this is one more point that he made that I I really like paragraph 11 says so we realize that we're here in a negative form and as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive because it's because of the positive that makes the negative amen how many of you believe that your life here is a negative form emphasis on negative but the the negative is only to reflect that there's a positive somewhere else that's what gives us so much courage because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there had to be an object somewhere or to strike the Light Strike the lens or there would be there wouldn't be any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and know that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflecting something here on Earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't I'm the wor worst deceived man in the world I've spent my life in vain but I know beyond a shadow shadow of a doubt that it's there that's why we're here oh what courage that gives us friends what is that that's that image he had before the foundation of the world and he knows every stroke in our life what's he doing he the negative is going to reflect the positive and he's going to bring it from negative back to positive let's go to paragraph 41 over on page eight I'm sorry page nine right in the middle of page nine his toils and wearies and long nights and housed away from the world for days and maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it and get back and no that's just not the way it was now it's got to come down to this and rubbing it then when he saw it just perfect then he saw in reality the negative of what was in his mind had become real it became positive therefore it sprung into him and it was so real that he must cry speak praise God brother benam starts using this negative and positive and back in the day brother Brenham was preaching it wasn't like the day we're in now with digital photography but back in the day uh he was speaking of he was speaking of old photography where you take a picture and on the picture it imposes an image on the negative then you take the negative and you take it through a process of development and through development you bring back the image of the positive I know my kids don't know anything about what I'm talking about Blake might remember a negative he may have seen one in his lifetime but the rest of us remember that amen that that the light would come onto a piece of film and and it would impose a negative image on a piece of film and then it would have to go they take that piece of film which became a negative of the of the real object and it would have to go through a process in a dark room and in the dark room it would go through different different processes of chemicals and it would go from tray to tray and Washings and chemical dips and all kinds of things and drying amen and then it would have to it would have to come back into the image of the the reality and then it could be taken out of the dark room and now you have the image from the positive yeah well that's very much like our life because before there was ever this negative life down here there was the positive in the mind of God there's already the positive image that the negative's taken off and what are we doing now we're in the dark room right now coming back to the image of the positive what's all the chemical dipping and the washing and the drying and the proc what's this whole process this whole process is to take the negative form of this life back to reflect the perfect image of the positive that was in God's mind because the reality is in God's mind that's the real that's the true and now we're being brought back into the image of that now remember when your picture is developed you take the picture and you say that's Chad no that's a picture of Chad that's Chad in another form the original was the reality amen the original was the thought amen and that will always be the original but now God's going to take that thought and bring it into a triun being which will be a perfect reflection of that thought and we're developing back into that perfect image of the thought amen it's already there friends yeah it's finished brother R said if it's not I'm the most deceived man on the earth said I've lived my life in vain but he said I know I'm positive sure that it's there how could he be so sure cuz he went beyond the curtain of time and he's seen praise God all right I want to look at one more thing in paragraph 50 on page uh 10 paragraph 50 on the bottom of page 10 and now to make the two one he put them like any great sculptor in the place that's beautiful a sculptor wouldn't make excuse me wouldn't make a Great Masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings as the Lord told us a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel when we become God's masterpieces we're not hidden an alley somewhere we must give light that's our job now on the earth when God's molding us into his masterpieces into the image of what was in his mind we're not to live in an alley somewhere he's not putting us back behind the house but he's going to set us on the Candlestick for the light to shine God will put our life on display how will he do it all kinds of different situations hardship difficulty he'll he'll he'll put you in the different groups in different settings what's he trying to do he's trying to put that Masterpiece on display so his handiwork can be seen amen and when he finishes his work and he finally has a bride that's standing complete in the image he had of bride before the foundational world the end time bride that represents the entire seven Church ages in Perfection now perfectly reflecting the image of Jesus Christ I don't know how he'll put it on display but he's going to put it on display I don't know by what measures and I don't know by what mechanism but he'll put it on display he's not going to hide it under a bushel basket praise God let us be prepared for that time God bless you let's all Stand Together musicians if you'll come and Blake if you'll come I love listening to these messages together I enjoy it so much every time I do it I'm going to like we're going to do that more often but I don't know what happens time goes fleeing away so fast but I'm thankful for these times that we've got to do this and I'm thankful for this time and I'm looking forward to next Wednesday already I wanted to make an announcement here I forgot to announce earlier this Sunday brother Jean kadema will be here ministering for us so we're excited to have him back and maybe he can give us an update of how things are going there and so I'm really pleased that he's able to come and join us for the service this Sunday so be praying for him and be praying for that amen let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for the privilege of being here God the privilege of having ears to hear a heart to perceive God when we hear that voice Lord it does something to the inside of us and we know it's not it's not just vocal cords over Airwaves lord it's not just that but there's something behind it Lord there's a reality there's a truth to your word God I so thank you for giving us a heart a desire a longing to hear that word so thankful that you brought us together with like-minded believers who you've drawn together with the same desire Desire with the same Purpose with the same heart and that we can join together and listen to this voice you've given us because your prophecy is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God shall be finished oh God we believe that that's this day and we're hearing the voice of the seventh angel and we are in Prophecy we're right in the middle of Prophecy it's being fulfilled right now right here tonight right inside of us Lord God I know there must be some more Hammer marks there must be some more rubbing that's needed on this part of the Masterpiece but oh God I surrender to it Lord I just yield to your hand because you're the master Craftsman you already know what you want you already know the part the portion of this image that I'll fulfill and you know how to get me Lord to reflect what you had in your mind before the foundation of the world and I just yield to your hand and say God you're the master I trust in you if you have to beat if you have to polish whatever you have to do I'm surrendering to you oh God God I thank you for this word I thank you to be alive in this day I thank you that you've brought us to this truth and I thank you Lord that you're allowing us to hear it again and again may it be a molding force a shaping force in our lives may you draw out of your seed that's in us that life Lord may it be a perfect reflection of your desire for the end time God we love you we thank you for this time we ask that you bless us as we go from here and may we all go as lights in a dark World by your grace we love you we ask your blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all brother Blake well he is able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today he is able more than aable to handle anything that comes my way he is able more than aable to do much more than I could could ever dream he is able more than able to make me what he wants stop for a minute amen it was just on my heart to have special prayer for our brother Daniel Aaron as you know many of you know Daniel was struggling years ago he had a really struggle with depression and anxiety and it got really bad and then by the grace of God God delivered him amen we went to prayer and God supernaturally delivered him and he's had a a relapse over the last two weeks and he thinks maybe it's related to some medication he was taking but he wasn't sleeping his anxiety went off the charts and and the devil's really jumped on that old weakness that's in him but I want to stand together with a brother amen I you know if I was laying unconscious somewhere I couldn't pray for myself but I would expect all my brothers and sisters to join and pray with me and I just think it's a privilege that we can stand in the gap for our brother when he's struggling so bad right now when there's confusion and anxiety and we can stand in the Gap and we believe we know beyond a shadow of a doubt God hears our prayers that'll answer and he said if there's other two or three Gather in my name and that whatever they ask whenever they pray touching Heaven I'll hear from heaven and I'll answer so let's just bow our heads and pray together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord first of all we want to thank you for your great power for your mercy which is new every morning for all the wonderful works that you've done God we glorify your name for you have healed us time and time again you have delivered us from every trapping of the enemy Lord we can stand from now for hours and hours days and days for weeks as we come one by one and testify of your delivering power of how faithful you are to keep your word the times you healed us the times you delivered us the times you rescued us and God we could testify to you and remind you Lord of your word for you promised us Lord that by your stripes we are already healed you went to Calvary and shed your blood for our salvation but also for every Redemptive promise lord it's ours you already put it in our hands you already gave it to us and you've given us you've given us the gift of faith to to reach out and grab it Lord you've given us the checkbook but you've also given us the faith and the understanding to write out the check and to sign your name because you put your name Upon Us Lord God we thank you for healing our brother Daniel so many years ago Lord you rescued him when it was so Troublesome and he was so confused and so hurt and God he's been so blessed Lord these last few years and God the enemy would try to take advantage of a weakened State Lord and and jump on an old wound a weakened spot Lord in his mind but God we're standing here as his brothers Lord as your attributes upon this Earth Lord we're standing here representing you for you told us Lord to ask Lord we have not because we ask not so we're coming and asking that you would deliver our brother in the name of Jesus Christ according to the stripes that you bore and the blood that you shed we're claiming the promise for our brother Daniel God I pray Lord that you would go to him that you would give him rest for his mind rest for his Spirit Lord that you would calm all the agitation and all the anxiety that you would draw it out and
