[14:08] and god bless you while you're standing
[14:09] if you want to turn to the book of
[14:10] genesis we'll turn there together and
[14:13] begin in genesis i'll just give you a
[14:15] quick update on brother juan he is doing
[14:17] better and improving day by day they
[14:19] thought that he would get to go home by
[14:21] yesterday but the doctor kept him and i
[14:24] asked brother juan he wasn't sure why
[14:25] but he's improving greatly he's feeling
[14:28] better getting stronger and and so we
[14:31] appreciate your prayers and just be
[14:32] praying for him i assume he'll get to go
[14:34] home after the weekend
[14:36] and it won't be long until we'll see him
[14:38] here because that brother loves to be in
[14:39] church so
[14:40] it'll be soon so just keep him in prayer
[14:43] and that he can get released soon
[14:45] also i forgot to mention on wednesday at
[14:47] the end of service but brother emmanuel
[14:49] and sister mimi sabasu are in oregon
[14:51] right now with brother rich cobb in the
[14:52] assembly there and he's sharing some
[14:55] testimony about the work he's doing in
[14:56] congo and ministering there so
[14:58] he'll be doing that yes last evening and
[15:01] today so just remember him in prayer and
[15:04] give that god give them traveling
[15:06] mercies on their way home
[15:07] amen
[15:08] let's look at genesis chapter 1
[15:11] verse 1.
[15:16] in the beginning god created the heaven
[15:19] and the earth
[15:20] and the earth was without form and void
[15:22] and darkness was upon the face of the
[15:24] deep and the spirit of god moved
[15:27] upon the face of the waters man god
[15:29] bless you as you're seated
[15:31] and may the lord bless us as we look
[15:33] into his word and may he give us the
[15:35] spirit of revelation amen
[15:38] amen i want to look at the the this uh
[15:41] phrase the spirit of god moved upon the
[15:43] face of the waters and look at some
[15:45] things that brother branham said this
[15:47] word moved means one of the definitions
[15:49] is to hover amen so the holy
[15:53] the holy ghost the spirit of god was
[15:55] hovering over the waters and we know
[15:58] that uh by the message that we find the
[16:00] earth was in a state of judgment from
[16:02] something that happened before so
[16:05] something previously happened causing
[16:07] the earth to be found now in the state
[16:09] of judgment where it's just death all
[16:11] over it's shrouded in darkness amen
[16:14] and there's no form and it's void and
[16:17] there's just nothing there amen but the
[16:19] holy ghost is hovering the spirit of god
[16:22] hovering over over the over the waters
[16:25] amen and brother bam says in the message
[16:28] conference and see when god made man he
[16:31] began to brood over the earth up come
[16:34] like easter flowers upcome grass
[16:36] upcoming species rising higher and
[16:38] higher
[16:39] the great holy spirit brooding amen so
[16:42] the bible says the spirit of god hovered
[16:44] but brother bannon begins to attach it
[16:46] to brooding amen the spirit of god is
[16:49] moving over the waters amen because he
[16:51] does not intend for it to stay in a form
[16:53] of judgment he does not intend for it to
[16:56] stay shrouded in darkness and void amen
[16:59] but god has a purpose for this creation
[17:01] and whatever happened before amen caused
[17:04] it to fall into this state amen but god
[17:06] is not finished with the earth and he's
[17:08] not finished with his creation amen so
[17:11] the spirit of god begins to hover over
[17:13] it amen and begins to brood over it
[17:16] because he's going to bring it into a
[17:18] form of usefulness bring it back into
[17:21] what is in god's mind amen
[17:23] so the spirit of god moved or hovered
[17:26] upon the face of the waters back to the
[17:28] quote where brother brahma says the
[17:29] great holy spirit brooding brooding
[17:31] means to be mothering cooing
[17:34] coo the flowers come up the father said
[17:37] that's wonderful just keep it up and he
[17:39] brooded and after a while outcome birds
[17:41] and the next thing outcome animals he
[17:43] kept getting greater and greater and
[17:46] greater amen let's turn to deuteronomy
[17:48] chapter 32 real quick i want to catch
[17:51] one more verse while we're on this
[17:54] word brooding
[18:00] verse 32 sorry deuteronomy verse 32.
[18:08] and for a title this morning i'd like to
[18:10] talk about the conditions for life
[18:12] the conditions for life and this is not
[18:15] going to be anything that we haven't
[18:17] heard before it's very simple but very
[18:19] profound amen it's the conditions for
[18:21] life deuteronomy 32
[18:24] and verse
[18:26] 9.
[18:28] and the lord's portion is his people
[18:30] jacob is the lot of his inheritance and
[18:33] he found him in the desert land and in
[18:35] the waste howling wilderness he led him
[18:38] about he instructed him he kept him as
[18:40] the apple of his eye as an eagle stirth
[18:43] up her nest fluttereth over her young
[18:46] spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them
[18:48] bareth them on her wings so the lord
[18:50] alone did lead him and there was no
[18:52] strange god with him
[18:54] and god is speaking about choosing jacob
[18:57] amen and out of jacob would come the
[18:59] nation of israel and he he begins to
[19:02] describe how he nurtured jacob and how
[19:05] he brought him out of a barren
[19:07] wilderness into a fruitful land and
[19:09] verse 11 says as an eagle stir the
[19:10] burnest fluttereth over her young this
[19:13] word fluttereth is the same word as move
[19:17] when the spirit of god moved upon the
[19:18] face of the waters it hovers over so
[19:21] this is how god cared for jacob he
[19:24] fluttered over him as an eagle flood
[19:26] earth over her young amen and was cooing
[19:28] over them and and encouraging them to
[19:31] grow and to fly so this is how god amen
[19:34] brought up jacob so as the eagle stir
[19:37] that bernath fluttered over her young
[19:39] that means hover over or as the spirit
[19:42] of god moved upon the face of the waters
[19:45] so god amen was over the face of the
[19:48] waters amen to flutter over it or to
[19:50] hover over it to bring it back to life
[19:53] amen and he was fluttering over or
[19:55] hovering over jacob to bring him from a
[19:58] desolate land into that which was in
[20:00] god's mind from before the foundation of
[20:01] the world to bring him into life to
[20:03] bring him into his position amen so it's
[20:06] the hovering or the moving of the holy
[20:08] spirit amen that's drawing life
[20:11] brother man explains this in in a couple
[20:14] of places here in the identified
[20:16] masterpiece of god from 1964 he says now
[20:19] and when he made adam the first man
[20:22] how perfect it was he looked like god
[20:25] god the great holy spirit brooding over
[20:27] the earth the birds come out maybe in
[20:30] the animals and different things and
[20:31] kept coming more in the form of the one
[20:34] that was brooding until finally there
[20:36] came a specie just exactly like the one
[20:38] that was doing the brooding
[20:40] god who was doing the brooding god what
[20:43] was he doing amen he was hovering over
[20:46] his young he was bringing them into a
[20:48] position amen and god by the spoken word
[20:51] amen was setting the earth in order so
[20:53] god would speak to the word and the
[20:55] spirit would move over and draw out the
[20:58] flowers and draw out the plants and draw
[21:00] out all of these things amen and what
[21:03] was the purpose amen he was trying to
[21:05] bring a specie out of the earth that
[21:07] would be exactly the mirror image that
[21:10] reflect the one that was doing the
[21:11] brooding amen and when adam come forth
[21:14] he was in the reflection of god amen
[21:17] i'll read that again until finally there
[21:18] came a species just exactly like the one
[21:20] that was doing the brooding god god was
[21:23] man was made in the image of god then
[21:26] when he placed him in this great garden
[21:27] like michelangelo has placed his great
[21:29] life's work and all great sculptures god
[21:32] placed his handiwork in the garden of
[21:33] eden
[21:34] and made him a help me
[21:36] what a complete satisfaction it was to
[21:38] god till even he rested it was just at
[21:41] rest his work had been finished
[21:44] the holy ghost was was hovering over or
[21:47] or brooding over this great creation
[21:50] bringing the word of god to pass amen
[21:53] bringing the word into a manifestation
[21:55] until it built one thing upon another
[21:57] amen and it was bringing things into the
[21:59] right atmosphere to the right setting
[22:01] amen to the right position amen until
[22:04] the the very image of the one that was
[22:06] brooding could now stand upon the earth
[22:08] and god was so satisfied amen that he
[22:11] completed his work that he can now take
[22:13] his rest
[22:14] praise god he was brooding and working
[22:16] and bringing it up until he got to this
[22:18] accomplishment and after he met this
[22:20] accomplishment now god could rest
[22:22] because he had brought up what he had
[22:24] desired to bring up upon the earth
[22:27] praise be to god
[22:29] amen i want to read a quote out of this
[22:32] seed shall not be heir with the shock
[22:34] he was god the logos the word that went
[22:36] out of god
[22:38] when he began to brood upon the earth
[22:40] and brought forth marine life when the
[22:42] spirit of god the logos the word which
[22:44] god said let there be and there went the
[22:46] logos which is the word
[22:49] and god because all this was in the
[22:51] logos the whole word of god the whole
[22:53] bible for every age and as the logos
[22:56] began to breathe upon the earth there
[22:58] came marine life and building up the
[23:00] bird life and on up to animal life and
[23:02] finally there comes something in the
[23:04] representation or looked like the thing
[23:07] that was brewing it brooding over it god
[23:10] a man in the very image of gone
[23:12] that man fell like the seed has to fall
[23:15] and then god began to brood over that
[23:17] after the fall he brought up enoch he
[23:20] brought up elijah he brought up moses he
[23:22] brought up prophet after prophet trying
[23:24] to restore that image again
[23:27] and finally upon the earth came the
[23:28] genuine image of god himself again which
[23:31] was god the logos made flesh and dwelt
[23:34] among us
[23:35] amen so god was brooding until he got
[23:38] this image just right amen and he took
[23:40] his rest but then after the fall amen
[23:43] the spirit of god goes right back to
[23:45] brooding again because now this fallen
[23:48] image is just like the fallen earth in
[23:50] genesis 1 1 and the brooding of god is
[23:53] going to bring it back to what it was in
[23:55] his mind before the foundation of the
[23:57] world and now as man fell god goes back
[24:00] to brooding again so he can bring back
[24:02] another manifestation of himself so he
[24:05] brooded over the patriarchs over the old
[24:08] testament until he got finally again
[24:10] upon the earth another man in his image
[24:13] and that was christ jesus
[24:16] now he doesn't stop there
[24:19] he says now that same logos has a part
[24:23] he has got a bride
[24:26] oh my
[24:28] that same logos has a part he has a
[24:31] bride amen the work wasn't complete
[24:33] because god he kept brooding and working
[24:36] until he brought up the man but he
[24:37] didn't take his rest till the man had a
[24:39] help meet amen because out of the man
[24:42] came his help me when they united back
[24:44] together god then entrusted the care of
[24:47] his creation to them and took his rest
[24:49] but what brought him out of his rest is
[24:51] when they fell and he says i will
[24:53] restore and he begins to restore the
[24:55] masterpiece again and he's brooding and
[24:58] brooding and brooding until he brings
[25:00] back the man amen but there's a logos
[25:03] has another part there's a part of that
[25:05] logos that's his bride
[25:08] so he's got to keep brooding
[25:10] till he brings her out
[25:13] amen
[25:15] so we see
[25:18] uh in the creation story let's go back
[25:20] to genesis chapter one
[25:24] we see that there's conditions for life
[25:32] and i want to that's what i want to talk
[25:34] about
[25:35] now we we looked at the big picture what
[25:37] god is doing in creation
[25:40] than what god's been doing through the
[25:42] the the old testament and the new
[25:44] testament how that holy ghost has been
[25:46] brooding to bring that life up but now i
[25:49] want to break it down individually to
[25:51] the individual so we have the what god
[25:53] does i've said this many times what god
[25:55] does in the macrocosm he does in the
[25:57] microcosm what god does on the grand
[25:59] scale he does in our lives
[26:01] what god does in his life he does in the
[26:03] grand picture amen it's all the same
[26:05] thing the same prophecies the same word
[26:07] rolling on and on what works for the
[26:10] whole bride works for us
[26:12] individually amen
[26:14] so in the
[26:16] in the smyrna church age out of the
[26:18] church age book it says now
[26:20] there here we come to a conclusion
[26:23] as the eternal logos god was manifest in
[26:26] the sun and in jesus do what all the
[26:28] fullness of the godhead bodily
[26:30] and that eternal one was the father
[26:32] manifest in flesh and thereby gain the
[26:35] title of son
[26:36] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[26:39] our turn become the many members spoken
[26:42] word seed
[26:43] manifest in flesh
[26:45] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[26:47] in flesh are the sons of god
[26:50] even as we are so called we did not
[26:52] become seed by the rebirth
[26:54] this is important
[26:56] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[26:59] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[27:02] for only the elect can be reborn
[27:06] because we were seed is the reason we
[27:09] could be quickened in non-seed there is
[27:11] nothing to quicken
[27:14] this is an important principle amen this
[27:16] is a this is a principle that gives us
[27:19] so much uh satisfaction so much
[27:22] confidence amen that if i ever if i ever
[27:25] am a child of god i've always been a
[27:27] child of god
[27:29] amen and this is going to tie right into
[27:32] genesis 1 as we keep going on
[27:35] he says uh further down and are in the
[27:38] same message actually no just uh
[27:40] uh two pages before in the smyrna church
[27:42] age it says now it says that he has
[27:45] chosen us in him jesus before the
[27:47] foundation of the world that means that
[27:50] we were right there with him in the mind
[27:52] and thoughts of god before the
[27:54] foundation of the world
[27:55] that gives an eternal quality to the
[27:58] elect
[28:00] don't ever forget that
[28:02] an eternal quality what's that quality
[28:05] that thought that is expressed in you
[28:07] that thought amen that is the seed gene
[28:10] of god that's in you amen that thought
[28:13] it gives an eternal quality to the elect
[28:16] you can't get away from that
[28:19] now here's where i want to spend a
[28:20] little bit of time in the fourth seal
[28:24] the prophet of god says they didn't have
[28:26] anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 it
[28:29] said in the beginning god created
[28:31] heavens and earth period see that's all
[28:33] now the world without form and void and
[28:35] said i believe every seed was laying
[28:38] right there from some other civilization
[28:40] or something
[28:42] and as soon as the water lifted off and
[28:44] the light struck it upon up come the
[28:46] trees and everything the same thing with
[28:49] the human being it's a type
[28:52] when all the mist is moved away and the
[28:54] revealed truth to that real seed laying
[28:56] there still germatized and the light of
[28:58] the gospel can strike it
[29:00] by a true vindication of the word it'll
[29:03] live it's got life in it outside of that
[29:06] it can't live it has got no life in it
[29:10] amen
[29:11] so so brother branham is showing us amen
[29:14] that in the creation story the earth is
[29:16] void and without form but brother
[29:18] branham said down below those waters
[29:21] were seeds from some other civilization
[29:23] or something amen somehow there was
[29:26] already seeds and those seeds that were
[29:28] laying under the water are already
[29:30] germatized they already had life inside
[29:34] amen but the condition that they were
[29:36] under was not conducive to life amen
[29:38] they could not come forth in that
[29:40] condition amen so the holy ghost began
[29:43] to brood upon the earth and change the
[29:46] condition and the reason he's changing
[29:48] to condition is because he knows the
[29:50] seeds laying there so he's changing the
[29:53] condition to bring out the life of the
[29:54] seed
[29:57] because he already knows the seeds there
[29:59] he already has a plan for that seed and
[30:02] the destruction the the judgment that
[30:05] that seed is under now does not change
[30:08] the fact that god knows it's there and
[30:10] still has a purpose for it and wants to
[30:13] bring it forth to manifest what was in
[30:14] his mind
[30:17] amen
[30:18] so we see we see our life laying in
[30:22] genesis chapter one
[30:24] we see ourselves from the very beginning
[30:27] of the bible we see the mystery of the
[30:29] seventh seal and we see ourselves amen
[30:32] right in the word of god because when we
[30:34] were born in this earth we came shrouded
[30:37] in darkness amen we came covered over
[30:40] amen there was a seed buried in this
[30:42] earth amen but our minds were dark into
[30:44] that we had absolutely no uh we were in
[30:46] spiritual amnesia we had no remembrance
[30:49] of anything we recovered over with an
[30:51] earthly spirit
[30:54] but god was going as god if he's going
[30:56] to bring that seed to life he has got to
[30:59] change the conditions around that amen
[31:02] to bring out what's already there
[31:07] in the message one in a million said did
[31:08] you ever notice a seed as reverend pitts
[31:10] was speaking a few moments ago
[31:12] and how a seed goes into the ground many
[31:15] seeds are there in the ground when god
[31:17] moved upon the water with the light and
[31:19] the light brought forth the first
[31:21] presence of god spoke spoken light came
[31:24] by god's word
[31:25] and god's word is the only thing that
[31:27] still brings light
[31:29] and when the waters went back the seed
[31:32] was already in the earth and the light
[31:34] only brought forth the seeds that
[31:35] remained with german them coming forth
[31:38] god making his creation
[31:41] and now on easter morning there was
[31:42] another light struck the earth when the
[31:44] holy spirit was given and it's given to
[31:47] bring life to those seeds that god by
[31:49] his foreknowledge knew that would be
[31:51] here on the earth as he knew the first
[31:53] natural seed he knows where the
[31:55] spiritual seed is
[31:57] so
[31:58] let's look at genesis 1 again
[32:01] we've we read genesis verse 1 verse 1
[32:04] and 2 and the spirit of god moved upon
[32:07] the face of the earth hovered over and
[32:09] brother venom said
[32:10] brooded over
[32:12] mothered over bringing up amen the word
[32:15] of god
[32:16] and look let's look at verse 3 now
[32:19] and god said let there be light and
[32:22] there was light
[32:23] and god saw the light that it was good
[32:26] and god divided the light from the
[32:28] darkness and god called the light day in
[32:31] the darkness he called night in the
[32:33] evening in the morning or the first day
[32:36] amen so this is uh
[32:39] what i want to begin talking about here
[32:41] brother franco if you could bring up the
[32:42] whiteboard for me i'm going to draw
[32:44] something out
[32:47] he says
[32:48] first thing
[32:49] that we have
[32:51] is we have a seed
[32:53] buried in earth under a state of
[32:55] judgment
[32:57] that's what we begin with
[32:59] there is not going to be any
[33:01] manifestation whatsoever on the face of
[33:03] the earth unless there's a germatic seed
[33:06] under the waters
[33:09] so the moving of the holy spirit the
[33:12] hovering the cooing of the dove of the
[33:15] holy ghost amen is there to bring about
[33:19] the word of god and move the conditions
[33:21] into such a way that what's already down
[33:24] there with life in it will come forth
[33:27] and manifest what's on the inside amen
[33:30] the holy ghost is not able to change
[33:33] what that seed is
[33:36] it's there to bring out the life that's
[33:38] in the seed
[33:41] amen
[33:43] this is important to know because this
[33:45] is how god brings us to life amen
[33:49] amen praise god so the first thing i
[33:53] want to write
[33:54] is the first thing you start with
[33:57] you must
[34:02] have
[34:03] a
[34:04] seed
[34:09] if there is no seed down under the
[34:12] waters
[34:13] all the movement of the word
[34:16] will not bring anything into
[34:18] manifestation
[34:20] because everything the holy ghost is
[34:23] moving and brooding in the spirit of god
[34:26] is taking the word of god and making a
[34:28] condition and moving things around so
[34:31] that it can cou to or draw the seed
[34:34] that's already there which germatized
[34:37] amen from some previous civilization and
[34:40] i want to tell you that if you're a
[34:41] child of god you've got a germination
[34:44] from a previous civilization amen
[34:47] from the faith civilization amen you've
[34:49] come from the mind of god amen and so
[34:52] now the most important thing to start
[34:54] with is a seed there must be a germatic
[34:58] seed and brother branham said under the
[35:00] flood there was probably other seeds
[35:02] amen that didn't have life in them they
[35:04] weren't germatized and they were just
[35:06] burned out by the floods
[35:08] but the the holy ghost is moving over
[35:12] the waters and moving uh upon this earth
[35:16] to bring the life that's in the seed
[35:19] into manifestation this is so important
[35:21] you must have a seed
[35:26] how did it get there
[35:27] it had to get there before genesis
[35:30] 1 2. amen
[35:34] how when you come into this story
[35:37] the seed had already needed to be sown
[35:41] before you get to genesis 1 2. by the
[35:44] time you get to genesis 1 2 amen
[35:47] the seed is already there and already
[35:51] buried in the earth under judgment
[35:54] it was already there
[35:56] it wasn't put there
[35:58] in genesis 1 2 it was already there
[36:02] brother mum says
[36:04] in the message there's a man here that
[36:05] can turn on the light he said it takes
[36:08] the light of god to strike the word to
[36:10] make it live here's what he spoke
[36:13] brother brandon pat's his bible oh i'm
[36:15] sorry
[36:16] brother random patch's bible
[36:18] now let this now let the light shine
[36:21] amen let the light shine and the light
[36:24] will bring every word to its right
[36:25] position in its season amen you see when
[36:28] it comes time
[36:30] this is really important the word in its
[36:32] right position in its season amen you
[36:35] see when it comes when it comes time
[36:38] sometimes that grain lays in the earth
[36:40] dormant all through the winter like seed
[36:42] winter wheat sowed in the ground but
[36:44] when the sun gets just right oh it's got
[36:47] to live and it can't live without the
[36:49] sun and god has made promises for every
[36:52] age and every day and when the light
[36:55] gets right and the shines upon that
[36:57] it'll produce just exactly what the word
[36:59] said because he is the light and the
[37:01] life
[37:03] so the first thing you need you must
[37:04] have a seed then once you have a seed
[37:09] then
[37:10] you must have light
[37:15] and we're going to follow the
[37:17] the the creation story here in genesis
[37:19] 1.
[37:20] the first thing that god does the first
[37:23] thing he speaks is let there be light
[37:25] amen because the first thing you need to
[37:27] make a seed live is light so god brings
[37:31] the word first amen
[37:33] that's why amen this this bible was
[37:36] written before the foundation of the
[37:37] world
[37:38] the word has been around amen the word
[37:40] is part of god the word is god amen the
[37:43] the the the seals were sealed before the
[37:46] foundation of the world god had light
[37:48] and then he began to let the light shine
[37:50] amen
[37:51] but you have to have light first
[37:53] now in the message god's only provided
[37:55] place of worship he said now think these
[37:57] men why was they called and was put in a
[37:59] condition these pharisees by jesus said
[38:02] in vain you worship me worship him
[38:04] genuine worship true worship from their
[38:06] hearts
[38:07] in vain you worship me why
[38:09] teaching for doctrine the tradition of
[38:12] man therefore you make the commandments
[38:14] of god of no effect to the people
[38:16] if i taught you a methodist message it
[38:19] would take no effect on you
[38:21] this is bride time
[38:23] [Music]
[38:26] so
[38:27] you must have light
[38:30] but you must have the right light for
[38:33] the right season
[38:37] there's a light that shines all year
[38:39] long but throughout the year there's
[38:42] certain seasons for growth of certain
[38:45] seeds
[38:46] brother baby explains this and makes it
[38:48] so simple that you don't sow your seed
[38:51] amen in the wrong when the sun is in the
[38:53] wrong position because as it travels
[38:55] amen from the north to the south it's
[38:58] not the right time amen for that for the
[39:00] sun is not in the right position the
[39:02] light is not right to bring forth that
[39:04] seed amen but when the sun moves back to
[39:06] the north again it's time to plant the
[39:08] seed it'll bring forth but there's some
[39:10] seeds you plant in the fall there's some
[39:12] seeds you plant in the spring there's
[39:14] some seeds you plant early there's some
[39:16] seeds you plant late
[39:18] but there's got to be the right light
[39:20] for the right seed and when the light
[39:22] right hits the right seed in the right
[39:24] season it brings it to life because that
[39:27] seed is meant for that light and for
[39:29] that condition and under that condition
[39:31] it springs forth to life
[39:34] and that's why brother venom is telling
[39:36] us here
[39:37] that sometimes the grain lays door and
[39:39] the earth dormant
[39:40] all through the winter like seed winter
[39:42] wheat sowed in the ground but when the
[39:44] sun gets just right it's got to live
[39:47] it can't live without that sun
[39:50] so every age
[39:53] has to produce the right light we know
[39:55] that we're in the bright age amen
[39:58] so brother braham was explaining this
[40:00] and
[40:01] god's only provided place of worship
[40:03] this is bride time
[40:05] if moses taught the message of noah it
[40:07] would take no effect
[40:09] because it was the light for a different
[40:11] season amen so now there has to be a
[40:14] different light with a different
[40:16] strength with a different manifestation
[40:18] for a different seed
[40:20] if jesus thought moses message would
[40:22] take no effect because the predestinated
[40:24] seeds are laying there that will only be
[40:27] watered by that type of water that's
[40:29] given for that seed
[40:30] it won't grow any other condition it
[40:32] must be the condition that grows it
[40:36] so now we see that that
[40:39] in order for the seed to come to life
[40:41] first there has to be light but there's
[40:43] got to be a specific light for a
[40:45] specific seed and a specific season
[40:48] that's why you weren't alive 2 000 years
[40:51] ago that's why you weren't alive 200
[40:53] years ago but god ordained that the seed
[40:56] in you would come forth in a certain
[40:57] season and god would make sure there's a
[40:59] certain light shining in this season
[41:02] because there's a seed laying down
[41:03] inside of you from a previous
[41:05] civilization or something
[41:08] that's waiting to come in contact with a
[41:10] certain line and when that light hits
[41:13] that seed it'll spring forth the life
[41:15] and manifest what is locked inside that
[41:17] seed and that seed that is locked in you
[41:20] and i in this time is not a seed
[41:22] predestinated for luther's age amen it's
[41:24] beyond that it's not predestinated for
[41:26] wesley's age it's beyond that this is
[41:28] bride time amen there's a bride seed
[41:30] that has been planted deep down in the
[41:33] earth of you amen waiting to come in
[41:35] contact with a certain light and that
[41:38] light will bring it to life
[41:41] amen i'm preaching this for many of us
[41:43] amen this is an encouragement because
[41:44] we've gone through this process the holy
[41:46] ghost is brooded over us brought us into
[41:48] a condition to bring that seed to life
[41:51] and now that seed is living in us and
[41:53] manifesting amen but there's people
[41:55] among us who still need the brooding of
[41:57] the holy ghost to bring that seed to
[42:00] life amen and there's going to be no
[42:02] life in this place if we don't get the
[42:05] right light
[42:08] amen
[42:10] this is what this is what i want to talk
[42:12] about in the conditions for life amen
[42:14] we've got young people that are coming
[42:16] up we've got people who are new people
[42:18] are coming in whatever condition it is
[42:21] maybe people been here for a while amen
[42:23] and the condition has never gotten right
[42:25] for that seed to strike amen but in
[42:28] order for that to come to life first
[42:30] there must be a seed there
[42:34] and the seed can lay dormant for a long
[42:36] time
[42:39] it can lay dormant for a long time amen
[42:42] but the only way that that bride seed
[42:45] and this bright time will come manifest
[42:48] bride life is if we have the bride
[42:50] message amen in the bright age
[42:54] if we don't have the right light and we
[42:56] don't preach the right light we will
[42:58] never bring life to the seeds that are
[43:00] predestinated to manifest in this day
[43:03] that's why we cannot preach
[43:04] denominational life we cannot preach
[43:07] previous age life everything we preach
[43:10] amen must be filtered through the
[43:12] message that god has given us in this
[43:13] day with the full revelation of the word
[43:17] amen it doesn't mean that we don't
[43:19] preach justification because luther
[43:20] preached justification justification is
[43:22] part of the word amen but when you
[43:24] filter that through the message amen
[43:26] brother branham brought us perfect
[43:28] justification pure justification true
[43:30] justification to where you're not
[43:32] justified now by the choice you made
[43:35] amen you're justified by what christ did
[43:37] for you amen and now you're just
[43:40] not forgiven
[43:44] brother brother brother branham and the
[43:46] message he shined the light on the
[43:48] gospel to show us true justification not
[43:52] that you've now been forgiven amen it's
[43:54] just as if you never did it in the first
[43:57] place because that seed is your ought to
[44:00] be conditioned it's the true you and in
[44:02] that seed never disbelieve the word of
[44:04] god one day
[44:07] so true justification under the light of
[44:10] this day brings us to the realization
[44:12] that the real genuine me down on the
[44:14] inside this flesh has done all kinds of
[44:16] horrible things and suffered many
[44:18] consequences for it but thank god he's
[44:20] going to change this flesh
[44:23] but that soul that's been born again
[44:27] amen that seed that sprung to life
[44:30] that's the real me
[44:35] and justificat we preach justification
[44:38] but we don't preach luther's
[44:40] justification
[44:43] we preach what luther taught
[44:45] under the bright light of this age
[44:50] sanctification the same way
[44:52] sanctification by the spirit we must
[44:54] live a sanctified life but it's going to
[44:56] take the power of the holy ghost to live
[44:58] through us to bring us to true
[44:59] sanctification
[45:01] because if not we just take our own idea
[45:03] about sanctification and create another
[45:06] church order and another coat of rules
[45:08] and to cover conduct and consider that
[45:10] true sanctification true sanctification
[45:12] is when the holy ghost comes and burns
[45:15] out any desire for the world are the
[45:17] things of the world and begins to bring
[45:19] a natural life that's flowing out from
[45:21] you
[45:22] that no longer wants the things of the
[45:23] world not abstinence
[45:26] because it's wrong but abstinence
[45:28] because i don't want it anymore
[45:32] so in order to bring a seed for this age
[45:35] of life we must preach the full power of
[45:39] the light word for this day
[45:42] that's why we cannot compromise on the
[45:45] word we cannot uh water down the word we
[45:48] cannot uh uh change what the prophet
[45:51] said or or somehow uh
[45:54] if it's too hard or too harsh make it a
[45:56] little softer we must preach it in the
[45:58] power that it was given to us because
[46:00] that is the light to bring the word
[46:02] to life in this day to bring these seeds
[46:05] to life
[46:07] that's why for me i said god help me
[46:09] never to back down on anything the
[46:11] prophet of god ever taught
[46:14] never
[46:16] no matter how harsh it sounds or how
[46:18] extreme it sounds amen that is the light
[46:21] that will bring the seed to life
[46:24] help me never amen try to to
[46:28] to deaden the effect by softening it
[46:30] because it's not palatable hey there's a
[46:33] people on the earth that can eat that
[46:34] word amen
[46:36] there's a people on the earth that wants
[46:37] it amen
[46:39] we must preach it in the full power it's
[46:41] given and preached the word with the
[46:42] full revelation that's been given to us
[46:47] amen
[46:50] now in the message god hiding himself in
[46:52] simplicity he says now in the old
[46:55] testament there might not be one person
[46:57] present this morning that was there the
[46:59] day of dedication
[47:02] when major ulrich played the music
[47:05] and i stood behind the three crosses
[47:06] here to dedicate the place
[47:09] amen i want to read one more scripture
[47:11] let's go over here to genesis 1 again
[47:15] let's read verse 6. i want to read this
[47:17] before i finish this quote
[47:22] genesis 1 6
[47:24] and god said let there be a firmament in
[47:27] the midst of the waters and let it
[47:28] divide the waters from the waters
[47:31] and god made the firmament and divided
[47:33] the waters which were under the
[47:34] firmament from the waters which were
[47:36] above the firmament and it was so
[47:39] and god called the firmament heaven
[47:41] and the evening and the morning were the
[47:43] second day
[47:45] so we're talking about the spring forth
[47:47] of seed
[47:48] this seed is going to come forth in the
[47:50] third day but he started with light the
[47:54] the spirit of god began to move upon the
[47:56] face of the waters and as it began to
[47:58] move then god spoke let there be light
[48:00] and there was light amen in the holy
[48:02] ghost all the time was brooding over the
[48:05] over the earth
[48:06] and then he he created the atmosphere
[48:09] and that's what i want to talk about
[48:11] next is atmosphere and then he separated
[48:13] the firmament and he created an
[48:15] atmosphere so the first thing he needed
[48:18] was light the second thing was
[48:21] atmosphere
[48:32] all right atmosphere
[48:34] and now brother branham is he's here and
[48:36] got him hiding himself in simplicity and
[48:38] he's talking about the old days in the
[48:40] tabernacle because they've just
[48:41] remodeled it and he's talking about uh
[48:43] the renovation and he goes back to the
[48:45] old times and he says i would not permit
[48:48] anybody the usher stood at the door to
[48:50] see that nobody talked when you're done
[48:52] you're talking outside you come in if
[48:54] you desire to silently you come to the
[48:56] altar and prayed silently you walk back
[48:58] to your seat open up the bible what your
[49:01] neighbor done that was up to him you had
[49:02] nothing to say
[49:04] if you want to talk to him say i'll see
[49:06] him outside i'm in here to worship the
[49:08] lord you read his word or sit quietly
[49:11] and then the music sister gertie i don't
[49:14] know whether she's here this morning or
[49:15] not sister gibbs the old piano i believe
[49:18] set back in this corner the best of my
[49:19] remembrance and she would play softly
[49:21] down at the cross where my savior died
[49:24] some real sweet soft music and then
[49:26] until it come time for the service and
[49:28] the song leader got up and led a couple
[49:30] of congregational songs and then if they
[49:32] had some outstanding solo they sang it
[49:35] but never just a bunch of carrying on
[49:37] and then the music continued played and
[49:39] then when i heard that i know it was my
[49:42] time to come out when a minister walks
[49:44] into a congregation of people praying in
[49:46] the anointing of the spirit you're bound
[49:49] to hear from heaven
[49:51] that's just all there's no way to keep
[49:53] from it but if you walk into confusion
[49:56] then you're so confused the spirits
[49:58] grieved
[50:00] but it was talking about how he set the
[50:02] church in order years ago
[50:05] and the reason he said it in order was
[50:07] to create an atmosphere
[50:10] amen and there's a reason that we have a
[50:12] church order that that's been taught to
[50:14] us from the by the prophet there's a
[50:16] reason that he told us to come to church
[50:18] early amen and he'd come to tell us to
[50:21] come to church early in one place he
[50:22] said 30 minutes early you can come to
[50:24] the altar and pray pray at your seat
[50:26] amen open your bible read amen pray
[50:30] meditate amen because we're here to
[50:32] create an atmosphere amen because before
[50:35] these seeds in genesis 1 begin to spring
[50:38] up and manifest first there was light
[50:40] then there was an atmosphere
[50:43] and so we want to create an atmosphere
[50:46] and that's what brother bannon's
[50:47] referring to and we want to constantly
[50:50] be conscious of this as believers that
[50:52] we create the right kind of atmosphere
[50:54] in here and it's not just an atmosphere
[50:56] of quiet
[50:58] that's important because we don't want
[50:59] confusion we don't want distraction but
[51:02] you can be dead silent amen and not
[51:05] prayerful and not with expectation and
[51:07] not focusing your mind on the service
[51:09] just sitting there silent amen and
[51:11] that's not creating the right atmosphere
[51:13] it's not the silence it's the meditation
[51:16] it's not the silence it's the focused
[51:18] attention it's not the silence but it's
[51:20] coming here preparing ourselves amen to
[51:23] create an atmosphere where the the
[51:26] spirit of god can take that word and
[51:27] plant it to somebody's heart create a a
[51:32] springing forth of life a quickening of
[51:33] the seed
[51:36] brother let's go to acts chapter 2.
[51:45] book of acts chapter 2.
[51:52] and i'm going to read it verse 4.
[51:55] i'm sorry verse 1 acts chapter 2 verse
[51:58] 1.
[52:06] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[52:08] come they were all with one accord in
[52:11] one place
[52:12] and suddenly there came a sound from
[52:14] heaven as a as of a rushing mighty wind
[52:16] and it filled all the house where they
[52:18] were sitting
[52:19] and there appeared unto them cloven
[52:21] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[52:24] each of them and they were all filled
[52:25] with the holy ghost
[52:27] and began to speak with other tongues as
[52:28] the spirit gave them
[52:30] utterance
[52:31] this word for the the translation for
[52:33] with one accord
[52:35] they were all
[52:36] amen with one accord and in one place
[52:41] and that this word means with one mind
[52:44] with one accord with one passion
[52:46] a unique greek word used ten of its
[52:49] twelve new testament occurrences in the
[52:51] book of acts
[52:52] helps us understand the uniqueness of
[52:54] the christian community this is out of
[52:55] the strongest concordance
[52:57] it says this word is a compound of two
[52:59] words meaning to rush along and in
[53:02] unison
[53:03] the image is almost musical a number of
[53:05] notes are sounded which while different
[53:07] harmonize and pitch and tone as the
[53:10] instruments of the great concert under
[53:11] the direction of the concert master so
[53:13] the holy ghost blends together the lives
[53:15] of the members of christ's church
[53:18] i love this when they were there when
[53:20] the holy ghost fell they were there in
[53:22] one accord
[53:24] and in one place
[53:26] amen one of the things that's most
[53:28] grieving to the holy ghost is discord
[53:30] among brethren
[53:32] when there's little ought and feelings
[53:34] and disagreements that's one of the most
[53:36] grieving things to the holy ghost amen
[53:39] the grieving to the spirit of god is
[53:41] discord among brothers it's actually an
[53:43] abomination in the eyes of god as he who
[53:45] was so discord among brethren
[53:47] and on the day of pentecost there's no
[53:49] accident that they were with one accord
[53:51] amen they were in one accord and in one
[53:53] place amen when the spirit of god fell
[53:56] they had gotten into a harmony with one
[53:59] another they were with one passion with
[54:02] one desire amen and i'll say it this way
[54:05] this is just me i doubt they were all of
[54:07] one opinion on all things
[54:11] i'm sure that and it was expressed later
[54:13] in different ideas about different
[54:15] things in the new testament church i
[54:17] doubt they were all of the same opinion
[54:19] but the thing that mattered most they
[54:21] were all unified around that they were
[54:23] they had one desire and that one desire
[54:25] was to seek god for the promise to
[54:27] follow amen to stay and wait for the
[54:30] promise that he gave the promise to the
[54:32] fathers to come to them amen and they
[54:35] were in one mind one heart one accord in
[54:38] one place with one passion with one
[54:41] desire and that's when the spirit of god
[54:43] fell upon them and god brought the
[54:45] promise to pass
[54:46] and i said when we come here amen let's
[54:49] come with one focus with one desire amen
[54:52] we can have different opinions about
[54:54] things and that's fine but when we come
[54:56] into this place let's set our heart on
[54:58] the word of god and say i want all that
[55:00] god has for me i'm here to hear this
[55:02] word for my day that will change my life
[55:05] and bring me into the very reflection of
[55:08] jesus christ on this earth
[55:10] let that be our focus amen each of us as
[55:13] an individual may we individually come
[55:15] with this mind and collectively as a
[55:18] church may we get in one accord so when
[55:20] we come to the service we are not here
[55:23] amen for we're not here to see one
[55:25] another although we love to see one
[55:27] another we're not here so we can get
[55:29] together and meet up and go do something
[55:31] after church that's not why we're here
[55:33] that gets everybody's mind in the wrong
[55:35] place we are here to worship god
[55:37] together to serve him as his bride and
[55:40] to feed from his hand the portion of
[55:42] manna that we need so that we might
[55:44] manifest his life on this earth
[55:48] we need to we need to come with one
[55:50] accord
[55:52] into one place
[55:54] amen will we always agree on everything
[55:56] absolutely not
[55:59] maybe someday we will i don't know
[56:01] that'll be a great day
[56:04] but when we come to the service let's
[56:06] come to the service
[56:08] to worship god
[56:10] and to hear from him
[56:12] every other agenda every thought let's
[56:15] put it aside
[56:17] but let's come
[56:19] in one accord
[56:21] and create the right kind of atmosphere
[56:24] where the holy ghost can move among us
[56:26] and drop into hearts and their
[56:28] lives brother ben has a lot to say about
[56:31] this i want to read several quotes on
[56:32] the subject
[56:34] he says in the message identified christ
[56:36] of all ages he said the holy spirit is
[56:38] timid very very timid
[56:41] where you have just one unbeliever or
[56:43] skeptic sitting around the holy spirit
[56:45] just can't work hardly
[56:48] listen to that i'm telling you
[56:51] just one unbeliever or skeptic sitting
[56:53] around
[56:55] now now you can say well i'm not a
[56:58] skeptic i'm not i'm not an unbeliever of
[57:00] the message i'm not a skeptic but if
[57:02] you're an unbeliever of the one
[57:04] ministering or a skeptic of the one
[57:05] who's ministering it's still going to
[57:06] create that atmosphere
[57:08] if you're skeptical of your brother here
[57:10] and you're skeptical of your brother
[57:12] there it's still going to create that
[57:13] atmosphere we've got to come into this
[57:15] place and say you know what these are my
[57:17] brothers and i'm going to worship god
[57:19] together any difference i have we'll
[57:21] talk about it
[57:23] we'll settle it but don't bring a
[57:25] critical skeptical spirit into here
[57:28] we have children that need to be born
[57:29] again
[57:31] we have young people that need an
[57:32] experience with god that will change
[57:34] them
[57:35] where the seed that's in their soul will
[57:36] quicken the life
[57:38] we need we need to all get on board with
[57:40] the same focus and the same goal in the
[57:42] same mind god is moving this bride
[57:44] forward and we want god to move freely
[57:46] among us
[57:48] this doesn't mean that if there's issues
[57:50] we ignore them there's issues deal with
[57:51] them
[57:52] but deal with them the scriptural way
[57:55] but don't let that critical skeptical
[57:57] nature float around in your mind and
[58:00] don't bring it into the fellowship of
[58:01] believers it'll create the wrong
[58:03] atmosphere
[58:06] and if and if somebody's got sucked into
[58:09] that spirit of criticism they've spread
[58:11] that through three or four or five and
[58:13] they've talked about it and all of a
[58:14] sudden they come in here with that same
[58:16] attitude listen it's like ice water and
[58:18] a service
[58:20] it grieves the spirit of god
[58:23] when there's issues to take care of
[58:25] take care of them
[58:26] but don't let them affect our atmosphere
[58:30] let's come together and say god i am
[58:32] here to worship you i'm here to put my
[58:34] shoulder to the wheel i'm here to be
[58:37] involved i am here brother venom said
[58:40] put your shoulder to the wheel wherever
[58:41] you go i am here to throw my lick of
[58:44] fire in with theirs i am i'm here to do
[58:46] my part i'm here to create an atmosphere
[58:49] and god help me to create that
[58:50] atmosphere
[58:53] one thing we learned is that the church
[58:56] is not a spectator sport
[58:59] this is not somebody play somebody sings
[59:01] somebody preaches everybody else watches
[59:03] and we go home no every individual is
[59:06] part of this amen this is a genuine
[59:09] worship of the children of god to god
[59:11] and god communicating back to his
[59:12] children each one of us have a role to
[59:14] play there is nobody here just watching
[59:18] and if there is somebody here just
[59:20] watching maybe they're a visitor and
[59:21] maybe we need to create an atmosphere
[59:23] for the visitor
[59:26] so that they can observe and that god
[59:28] can move in their heart
[59:29] but we're not here to observe we're here
[59:32] to participate
[59:36] amen
[59:38] let's look at mark chapter 5 together
[59:57] mark chapter 5.
[1:00:03] verse 38
[1:00:09] mark chapter 5 verse 38
[1:00:13] and he cometh to the house
[1:00:15] of the ruler of the synagogue and see at
[1:00:17] the tumult and them that wept and wailed
[1:00:19] greatly and when he was come in he saith
[1:00:21] unto them why make you this ado and weep
[1:00:24] the damsel is not dead but sleepeth and
[1:00:26] they laughed him to scorn but when he
[1:00:28] had put them all out
[1:00:30] he had to change the atmosphere
[1:00:33] when he put them all out he taketh the
[1:00:36] father and the mother of the damsel in
[1:00:38] them that were with him and then entered
[1:00:40] in there with the where the damsel was
[1:00:42] laying and he took the damsel by the
[1:00:45] hand and said unto her talithakumi which
[1:00:47] is being interpreted damsel i say to the
[1:00:50] arise and straightway the dams would
[1:00:52] arose and walked for she was of the age
[1:00:54] of 12 years and they were astonished
[1:00:56] with great astonishment
[1:00:58] amen jesus now he does this several
[1:01:00] times and brother brahma explains this
[1:01:02] to us he comes into this place and the
[1:01:04] atmosphere was not right there was no
[1:01:06] faith they didn't believe his words so
[1:01:08] he put them all out and he brought with
[1:01:10] him peter james and john himself the
[1:01:13] father and the mother and the damsel and
[1:01:15] it's amazing that that they walked in
[1:01:17] there there was there was six that that
[1:01:19] were in the room that were alive there
[1:01:21] was one that was laying there asleep
[1:01:24] so the one that laying there asleep was
[1:01:26] the seventh amen and jesus come and woke
[1:01:28] her up so the in the room there was as
[1:01:30] far as everybody else saw there was six
[1:01:32] but jesus knew there was seven the one
[1:01:34] just needed waking up
[1:01:36] and to wake her up he had to create the
[1:01:38] right atmosphere he had to get the
[1:01:40] unbelief out of the room amen he had to
[1:01:42] get the those who that were lamenting
[1:01:44] and wailing and disbelieving what he
[1:01:46] said he had to push them out of the room
[1:01:48] and he had to come in here and now with
[1:01:50] faith amen he had to wake up this one
[1:01:53] who was asleep and when they saw him
[1:01:54] come out there were seven alive that
[1:01:56] came out
[1:01:58] praise be to god amen somebody needs
[1:02:01] woke up this morning
[1:02:03] there's a there's a child of god laying
[1:02:05] asleep the seed is laying dormant
[1:02:07] somebody needs woke up amen let's create
[1:02:10] the right atmosphere let's push all the
[1:02:11] unbelief out and all the doubts and all
[1:02:14] the worries and all the anxiety about
[1:02:16] our problems let's push them out and
[1:02:18] let's all work to create an atmosphere
[1:02:20] of faith because god's going to wake
[1:02:22] somebody up amen somebody's going to
[1:02:24] wake up and there's going to be a damsel
[1:02:26] there's going to be a lad there's going
[1:02:28] to be somebody that is going to wake up
[1:02:30] when christ comes and touches them and
[1:02:32] says arise how's he going to do that
[1:02:35] he's going to call with his voice which
[1:02:37] is his word and he's going to wake them
[1:02:39] up
[1:02:41] jesus led one man outside the city
[1:02:44] brother branham said because of the
[1:02:46] unbelief the spiritual atmosphere of the
[1:02:47] city led him outside of the city to heal
[1:02:49] him
[1:02:50] amen there was one woman a woman of
[1:02:53] samaria he had to meet her alone
[1:02:56] because of the condition of her life and
[1:02:58] because you know even when his disciples
[1:03:00] showed up they had a little bit of an
[1:03:02] attitude
[1:03:04] even when his disciples finally showed
[1:03:05] up to the scene they wondered why he was
[1:03:07] talking to her
[1:03:11] right and here she is an outcast in
[1:03:14] society coming to the well at the wrong
[1:03:15] time of day amen and she probably
[1:03:18] grieves that she always has to go to the
[1:03:20] well alone
[1:03:22] for years it was probably everybody else
[1:03:24] visits at the well and they talk but
[1:03:26] because of my status i've got to come to
[1:03:28] the well alone amen but god needed her
[1:03:31] alone amen so jesus sent his disciples
[1:03:33] away on an errand because he didn't want
[1:03:36] any wrong attitudes about this woman
[1:03:38] amen she couldn't be in the city they
[1:03:39] had the wrong attitude about her he even
[1:03:41] sent his disciples away because they
[1:03:43] would have the wrong attitude about her
[1:03:44] but he created an atmosphere of faith so
[1:03:47] that he can wake up the seed that's
[1:03:48] laying inside of me
[1:03:51] amen sometimes we find ourselves alone
[1:03:54] and lonely amen don't worry about it
[1:03:56] amen maybe god wants you to be in a
[1:03:57] certain atmosphere so he can do a work
[1:03:59] in your life and if you find yourself
[1:04:01] alone for a season just look up and say
[1:04:03] god what is it you want to do in my life
[1:04:07] don't get in that atmosphere of gloom
[1:04:09] don't get in that atmosphere of
[1:04:11] depression don't give that atmosphere
[1:04:13] where you begin to feel sorry for
[1:04:14] yourself because of your condition
[1:04:16] you're gonna miss what god's doing
[1:04:19] keep the right atmosphere
[1:04:22] always believe
[1:04:24] in the face of every circumstance is
[1:04:26] always belief
[1:04:29] in 1956 brother brand preached the
[1:04:31] message to supernatural and in it he
[1:04:32] said but if we could ever get a group of
[1:04:35] people together
[1:04:36] where was genuine holy spirit atmosphere
[1:04:40] a sacredness and a sincerity in worship
[1:04:43] and men and women sitting in there are
[1:04:45] god-conscious and know that the great
[1:04:47] omnipotence of god is present ready to
[1:04:49] do all things without one shadow of a
[1:04:51] doubt it'll even have an effect upon the
[1:04:54] unbelievers
[1:04:56] that's sitting in this evening
[1:04:58] you can never come into that atmosphere
[1:05:00] without something happening
[1:05:03] praise be to god
[1:05:04] i like this quote because i read the one
[1:05:06] before that one skeptic one unbeliever
[1:05:08] amen can change the atmosphere but now
[1:05:11] brother branham's saying if everybody
[1:05:12] would get in the right atmosphere then
[1:05:14] it could affect the unbeliever
[1:05:18] and i hope
[1:05:20] i hope i hope i hope that in this
[1:05:23] building tonight is more believers than
[1:05:25] unbelievers i hope we can tilt the
[1:05:27] atmosphere
[1:05:28] i hope we have amen enough believers to
[1:05:32] to create the atmosphere that will
[1:05:33] affect the unbeliever not the unbeliever
[1:05:35] affect the believers
[1:05:38] but it's not going to happen amen
[1:05:40] without a conscious effort without
[1:05:42] deliberate effort amen we can't
[1:05:44] we we we we have to take the things the
[1:05:47] prophet gave us and the understanding
[1:05:49] that he taught us and we have to
[1:05:51] actually apply it
[1:05:54] amen we still fall back into traps
[1:05:57] and ourselves of thinking well you know
[1:06:00] god will take care of everything
[1:06:02] god will take care of everything but he
[1:06:04] gave us instructions for a reason
[1:06:07] he told us what to do and how to create
[1:06:09] an atmosphere and how to structure the
[1:06:11] church and what to do and what not to do
[1:06:13] he told us that for a reason
[1:06:17] we we think
[1:06:18] this is one thing that uh an
[1:06:20] understanding that i think is flawed and
[1:06:22] i want to i want to i'm going to put in
[1:06:24] a disclaimer i'm going to enter
[1:06:25] disclaimer right here i'm not preaching
[1:06:27] this because we have any problem i'm not
[1:06:29] dealing with a problem god laid it on my
[1:06:31] heart to deal with it
[1:06:32] so if i'm hitting a problem i'm doing it
[1:06:34] ignorantly praise be to god
[1:06:36] so pay attention
[1:06:39] as far as i know everything's fine
[1:06:43] but we cannot
[1:06:45] uh
[1:06:47] forsake
[1:06:48] the instructions that we have
[1:06:50] when god has told us what to do
[1:06:53] how to enter the church how to be sacred
[1:06:55] how to be prayerful how to come early
[1:06:58] we forsake that and don't do what he
[1:07:00] told us to do
[1:07:01] and think that somehow
[1:07:03] god will overlook our lack of obedience
[1:07:08] and he'll make everything work out
[1:07:09] anyhow
[1:07:11] this is what christians have done for
[1:07:13] generations
[1:07:15] when god comes and shows us how to
[1:07:17] overcome he teaches us how to create an
[1:07:20] atmosphere he shows us how to structure
[1:07:22] our church service and shows us how to
[1:07:24] come into the sanctuary and how to make
[1:07:26] it sacred and holy and how to be
[1:07:28] prayerful and he recommend coming 30
[1:07:31] minutes early and all of these things
[1:07:32] that he did if we want to still stand in
[1:07:34] the foyer and talk to everybody until we
[1:07:36] hear the first song played and run in
[1:07:39] and we expect god to cover for that
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:44] see we've got to take the right approach
[1:07:47] to what he gave us and if we go the
[1:07:49] right approach to what he gave us amen
[1:07:51] god is going to do what he promised to
[1:07:53] do
[1:07:55] amen but we have we have to do our part
[1:07:57] we have to believe what he gave us and
[1:07:59] apply it by faith and watch what god
[1:08:02] will do
[1:08:04] we can't take things trivial and lightly
[1:08:07] and expect the great power of god to
[1:08:09] overcome all my failings
[1:08:12] that's the wrong approach and the wrong
[1:08:14] attitude
[1:08:15] we think well you know
[1:08:17] what
[1:08:18] what will happen god forbid the day
[1:08:21] everybody forgets to pray for me and
[1:08:22] pray for the preaching
[1:08:25] and you just think well brother chad
[1:08:26] he's done it a couple hundred times
[1:08:28] it'll be fine
[1:08:29] god forbid
[1:08:31] i would ever have to stand here without
[1:08:33] a couple hundred people asking god to
[1:08:35] speak today
[1:08:38] please don't ever do that to me
[1:08:40] and please that's why i pray for the
[1:08:42] song leader i pray for the musicians i
[1:08:44] know what it's like i'm supporting them
[1:08:46] i'm praying that god will move through
[1:08:47] them amen oh god and put a right
[1:08:49] atmosphere in them that all the troubles
[1:08:51] of the day will vanish away and god will
[1:08:53] come on the scene and take i'm praying
[1:08:55] for them because i know what it's like
[1:08:56] we all need to be praying for them we
[1:08:58] need to pray for every part of the
[1:08:59] service everybody that's coming we need
[1:09:01] to pray for the young that's not born
[1:09:03] again we need to pray for those that
[1:09:04] need encourage we need to pray for the
[1:09:06] sick that will be healed we need to pray
[1:09:08] for the musicians and the song leader
[1:09:09] the sunday school teachers we need to
[1:09:11] pray for the minister behind the pulpit
[1:09:13] we need to pray for the deacons and
[1:09:14] trustees that god will get this thing
[1:09:16] right and god will move amongst us and
[1:09:19] god the the atmosphere will be right
[1:09:21] where seeds can spring to life
[1:09:25] we can't just constantly say well they
[1:09:27] got a gift it'll be fine
[1:09:30] now we're in this thing together let's
[1:09:32] create an atmosphere
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:40] so brother branham said
[1:09:42] one unbeliever skeptic can change the
[1:09:45] atmosphere but he said if everybody will
[1:09:47] get into a holy ghost atmosphere it'll
[1:09:49] have an effect on the unbeliever
[1:09:52] that's the story that i'm looking for
[1:09:54] that's the goal i've got not that we are
[1:09:56] so weak in our atmosphere that one
[1:09:58] unbeliever coming in amen we'll
[1:10:01] ruin it for all of us but that we are so
[1:10:03] heavenly minded and we come here with
[1:10:05] such a definite purpose amen and we we
[1:10:07] come in the atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:10:09] that that unbeliever will be affected by
[1:10:11] the atmosphere
[1:10:13] and affected by the atmosphere before
[1:10:15] the song ever starts
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:21] brother bram said
[1:10:22] you can't
[1:10:24] put genuine corn in something that won't
[1:10:26] unless it's earth and it won't grow you
[1:10:28] can lay it in the sun and keep it warm
[1:10:30] you can do what you want but it takes a
[1:10:32] certain kind of earth it must be there
[1:10:34] it must be buried it must be under the
[1:10:36] right atmosphere to make it bring forth
[1:10:39] you can have a good seed but it's got to
[1:10:40] be in the right atmosphere in the right
[1:10:42] place amen
[1:10:44] we can have good word but we have to
[1:10:46] have the right atmosphere
[1:10:52] let's look at ephesians chapter four
[1:10:54] together
[1:11:05] ephesians chapter 4
[1:11:11] verse 29
[1:11:20] ephesians chapter 4 verse 29 let no
[1:11:22] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:11:24] your mouth but that which is good to the
[1:11:27] use of edifying that it may minister
[1:11:29] grace into the hearers
[1:11:31] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:11:33] whereby ye are sealed into the day of
[1:11:35] redemption
[1:11:36] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:11:38] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:11:40] from you with all malice and be you kind
[1:11:44] one to another tender heart of forgiving
[1:11:45] one another even as god for christ's
[1:11:48] sake hath forgiven you
[1:11:51] i say praise god
[1:11:52] let's not grieve the holy spirit of god
[1:11:56] let's not take any wrong attitudes or
[1:11:58] wrong speech or do things the wrong way
[1:12:01] and treat others the wrong way and
[1:12:03] create the wrong kind of atmosphere but
[1:12:05] let's not grieve the holy spirit but
[1:12:06] let's create an atmosphere that's
[1:12:08] welcoming and inviting to the holy
[1:12:09] spirit
[1:12:12] brother branham he begins to talk about
[1:12:15] us as individuals i've been talking
[1:12:17] about the atmosphere in the church but
[1:12:20] in the sanctuary but the the atmosphere
[1:12:22] amongst us as an individual he says i
[1:12:25] believe in heartfelt religion
[1:12:27] i believe that you feel it that god
[1:12:29] gives you something inside of you that
[1:12:31] changes you it makes the atmosphere
[1:12:32] around you different i've tried that i
[1:12:35] know it's the truth that man create in
[1:12:37] himself the atmosphere that he lives in
[1:12:40] and around him
[1:12:41] is anointed with a spirit
[1:12:44] i've seen people you just couldn't get
[1:12:45] away from them you just love them
[1:12:48] there's something drawing about them
[1:12:50] it's because they live in that
[1:12:51] atmosphere they live under the power of
[1:12:53] the holy spirit
[1:12:55] and another message he said did you ever
[1:12:57] get around anybody you've seen nice
[1:12:59] people that you couldn't hardly stand to
[1:13:01] be around them
[1:13:02] brother graham's just being honest
[1:13:04] they're nice people but you just
[1:13:05] couldn't hardly stand to be around them
[1:13:07] now you know that's right isn't it and
[1:13:09] i've seen people that maybe that you
[1:13:11] just love to be in their presence
[1:13:12] haven't you seen people like that
[1:13:14] do you realize that you're sons of god
[1:13:17] the atmosphere and the air that you live
[1:13:19] in you create a situation around you
[1:13:22] that either draws or pushes away
[1:13:26] you see
[1:13:28] we create an
[1:13:30] atmosphere and if we're conscious of the
[1:13:33] atmosphere we're creating we can be
[1:13:35] yielded to the word of god into the life
[1:13:37] of god and create the right kind of
[1:13:40] atmosphere around us or we can yield to
[1:13:42] the negative that is around us and begin
[1:13:44] to speak negative and talk negative and
[1:13:46] we will create a negative atmosphere
[1:13:50] i've been with people they they believe
[1:13:52] the message people who believe the
[1:13:53] message believe god sent a prophet
[1:13:55] believe they're part of the bride but
[1:13:57] they are constantly in a realm of
[1:13:59] negative amen and negative things are
[1:14:02] always happening to them
[1:14:06] and you think
[1:14:07] it's almost like
[1:14:09] it's almost like
[1:14:11] every day something bad happens
[1:14:14] because they were just waiting for
[1:14:15] something bad to happen
[1:14:18] they expected something bad to happen so
[1:14:20] something bad happened
[1:14:22] they created the atmosphere for
[1:14:24] negativity
[1:14:25] they created the atmosphere that drew
[1:14:28] negativity to them and they become
[1:14:30] victims of their own atmosphere thinking
[1:14:34] it's everybody else around them all the
[1:14:36] co-workers at work they all have an
[1:14:38] attitude
[1:14:41] everybody i work with has a bad attitude
[1:14:47] and i haven't met one nice person today
[1:14:52] did you see one when you brushed your
[1:14:54] teeth because that's where it all
[1:14:55] started
[1:15:00] see
[1:15:00] we we get confused by things that are
[1:15:02] around us but brother brenham told us
[1:15:04] being sons of god we have the power to
[1:15:06] create atmospheres and we can create an
[1:15:09] atmosphere around us we need to be
[1:15:10] speaking the word of god confessing by
[1:15:13] faith amen what god has done for us we
[1:15:15] need to be happy and positive and joyful
[1:15:17] in the midst of trials and we will
[1:15:19] create an overcoming atmosphere around
[1:15:22] us amen an inviting atmosphere that
[1:15:24] people want to come in contact with not
[1:15:26] a negative pessimistic the world is
[1:15:28] black everything's wrong
[1:15:32] listen
[1:15:33] if that's the kind of religion you
[1:15:34] propagate nobody wants it
[1:15:38] but if you can have joy when everybody
[1:15:40] else is is is is in remorse when you can
[1:15:44] be positive when everybody else is
[1:15:46] negative when you see what god is doing
[1:15:48] and it's a blessing in your life when
[1:15:50] everybody else feels cursed amen they're
[1:15:52] creating an atmosphere that will draw
[1:15:57] amen
[1:15:58] brother i'm in the message when divine
[1:16:00] love is projected sovereign grace takes
[1:16:02] its place he says this
[1:16:04] then when you become a son or daughter
[1:16:05] of god
[1:16:06] your disposition changes your attitude
[1:16:09] changes your your your look towards life
[1:16:12] and towards others changes
[1:16:15] it doesn't mean that you just have
[1:16:16] joined church it means that you have
[1:16:18] been regenerated you have become a new
[1:16:20] creation in christ jesus the old things
[1:16:22] have passed away and god has spoken to
[1:16:24] you and you have become a new creature i
[1:16:26] want this to go way down even into the
[1:16:29] church members then as you would love to
[1:16:31] be in the presence of christ and you
[1:16:33] become part of christ
[1:16:34] then people love to become in your
[1:16:36] presence because you become a part of
[1:16:38] god son and daughter of god
[1:16:40] did you ever see people that you just
[1:16:42] love to be in their presence there's
[1:16:44] just something about them that just
[1:16:45] radiates that you just love to talk to
[1:16:47] them and other people who are nice
[1:16:49] people yet we don't say this unkindly
[1:16:52] but you just can't hardly stay around
[1:16:54] them it is because of the atmosphere
[1:16:56] that you create for you as a son of god
[1:16:59] or a miniature creator
[1:17:01] because you are a part of god
[1:17:05] remember brother burleigh wednesday was
[1:17:06] talking about the world that we could
[1:17:08] create
[1:17:10] but we also create an atmosphere around
[1:17:12] us we are a miniature creator and if we
[1:17:15] and brother ben said each one of us are
[1:17:17] a little dynamo we put off a little
[1:17:18] atmosphere around us and if we could be
[1:17:20] conscious of that we could use that
[1:17:23] power that god's placed in us to create
[1:17:25] for good and not for evil we can do it
[1:17:27] to change the atmosphere amen not make
[1:17:30] it worse amen remember when brother
[1:17:32] branham amen had a lot of visitors to
[1:17:34] his house one day and his wife got upset
[1:17:36] and the kids were fussing on the floor
[1:17:38] and everything was a little bit out of
[1:17:40] kilter in his home amen and his wife was
[1:17:43] upset because she hadn't even fed the
[1:17:45] kids the house has been full of visitors
[1:17:47] the atmosphere wasn't right amen brother
[1:17:49] branham walked in there and he says now
[1:17:52] he goes i put on my apron and i began to
[1:17:54] help washing dishes and he said i'd walk
[1:17:56] past my wife and i just touched her on
[1:17:58] the back and i was silently praying
[1:18:01] this is important
[1:18:02] because he wasn't casting the demon of
[1:18:05] frustration off of his wife
[1:18:07] verbally
[1:18:08] that would not have changed the
[1:18:09] atmosphere
[1:18:13] he silently said lord help her
[1:18:16] lord help her
[1:18:17] then he began to change the atmosphere
[1:18:20] and he started talking about a dress
[1:18:22] that he saw on the window and like to
[1:18:24] buy it for so after a few minutes she
[1:18:26] was smiling everything was fine and
[1:18:28] here's my favorite part
[1:18:30] she said i'll finish these dishes you go
[1:18:32] on
[1:18:38] see if you do it right there's rewards
[1:18:43] but see he had the power to change that
[1:18:45] whole environment in his home
[1:18:48] but he could have come in and hushed up
[1:18:50] and snapped at the kids and told his
[1:18:52] wife don't you know i'm serving god's
[1:18:54] people what's this bad attitude
[1:18:59] he would have created
[1:19:01] the atmosphere would have gotten worse
[1:19:04] more frustrated more depressed
[1:19:07] it would take a long time to come out of
[1:19:08] that
[1:19:10] and
[1:19:10] we can create
[1:19:12] we are let's just say this way we are
[1:19:15] creating an atmosphere
[1:19:16] around us all the time
[1:19:19] because we are miniature creators
[1:19:21] not that we can create we are creating
[1:19:24] the question that we have to ask
[1:19:25] ourselves is what atmosphere am i
[1:19:27] creating now
[1:19:29] and we could ask ourselves that question
[1:19:32] amen it would give us the the right
[1:19:34] understanding i need to change what's
[1:19:36] coming out of my mouth i need to change
[1:19:38] my
[1:19:38] my i need to think on the things that
[1:19:41] are righteous and pure and holy and just
[1:19:44] i need to think on these things
[1:19:46] because the things that i'm thinking on
[1:19:47] are changing my attitude i need to go
[1:19:49] back to thinking on the things that are
[1:19:51] lovely the things that are just the
[1:19:52] things that be of good character
[1:19:55] of value that's what i need to think on
[1:19:57] because you realize i'm projecting the
[1:19:58] wrong atmosphere but i've got the power
[1:20:00] to direct project the right atmosphere
[1:20:03] because atmosphere is so necessary for
[1:20:06] the seed coming to life because in
[1:20:08] creation first he brought the light
[1:20:10] which is the word then he brought the
[1:20:12] atmosphere and after he brought the
[1:20:14] atmosphere then he exposed the seed to
[1:20:17] the light and it germinated and it
[1:20:19] brought life
[1:20:22] amen
[1:20:24] i want to read that let's go back to
[1:20:25] genesis chapter 1.
[1:20:35] genesis chapter 1 verse 9.
[1:20:43] and god said let the waters under heaven
[1:20:45] be gathered together into one place
[1:20:47] and let the dry land appear
[1:20:50] and it was so
[1:20:51] and god called the dry land earth and
[1:20:53] the gathering together of waters called
[1:20:54] he sees and god saw that it was good
[1:20:57] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:20:59] grass and the herb yielding seed in the
[1:21:01] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[1:21:03] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[1:21:05] and it was so
[1:21:06] and the earth brought forth grass and
[1:21:08] herb yielding seed after its kind and
[1:21:10] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[1:21:11] in itself after its kind and god saw
[1:21:14] that it was good and the evening and the
[1:21:16] morning were the third day
[1:21:19] see
[1:21:22] god in order to bring the seeds that he
[1:21:25] knew were there
[1:21:26] he knew they were there
[1:21:28] so the spirit of god began to move to
[1:21:31] brood and god began to speak the word
[1:21:33] and the when the holy ghost began to
[1:21:35] brood amen and bring the conditions
[1:21:38] right to bring the seed out of the
[1:21:39] ground and first he brought the light
[1:21:42] which was the right light for the season
[1:21:45] and then he created the right atmosphere
[1:21:48] and then finally he parted the water and
[1:21:51] exposed the seed to the light
[1:21:55] and when the seed was finally exposed to
[1:21:57] the light because the light was already
[1:21:59] there and the atmosphere was right when
[1:22:01] he parted the waters amen it sprung to
[1:22:04] life and began to bear fruit
[1:22:07] and sometimes we're shrouded we come
[1:22:09] into this earth shrouded we're under the
[1:22:11] i would say it this way
[1:22:13] we're under the flood of our spirit
[1:22:15] realm of our own mind of our own
[1:22:17] humanity but somehow god will part the
[1:22:20] water amen to let the seed get exposed
[1:22:23] to the light but the light must already
[1:22:25] be there and the atmosphere must be
[1:22:27] right for when god depart the water for
[1:22:30] the light to strike the seed and bring
[1:22:31] it to life
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:34] i believe our children and men and our
[1:22:37] young people have seeds laying there
[1:22:39] that have to come to life
[1:22:42] we must never forget that that that we
[1:22:45] are growing in christ amen and that our
[1:22:48] children coming up amen they need they
[1:22:51] need to have a light god's provided the
[1:22:54] light we must preach the light
[1:22:56] they need the right atmosphere we must
[1:22:58] create the atmosphere in here but we
[1:23:00] must create the atmosphere in our homes
[1:23:02] as well
[1:23:03] because you can erase what we're doing
[1:23:06] here in your home with the wrong
[1:23:07] attitude in your home
[1:23:09] and then that seed is walking around
[1:23:11] constantly in the wrong atmosphere amen
[1:23:15] and and god's going to have to do some
[1:23:17] great work amen to bring the right
[1:23:19] atmosphere to bring the right life to
[1:23:20] that seed amen but in our homes amen if
[1:23:23] god has given us children we need to
[1:23:25] create the right atmosphere in our home
[1:23:27] and keep that atmosphere godly and keep
[1:23:29] it god centered and keep it focused on
[1:23:31] the word of god amen so that god when he
[1:23:34] wants he can part the water of that
[1:23:36] spirit realm and let the light strike
[1:23:38] that seed and bring forth amen what he
[1:23:41] has always intended to bring forth
[1:23:44] god knows the seed's there amen we gotta
[1:23:47] we gotta keep preaching the word that is
[1:23:50] the light for our day we have to keep it
[1:23:52] constantly amen constantly in the open
[1:23:55] constantly shining brighter and brighter
[1:23:57] and brighter and then we need to create
[1:23:58] the right atmosphere amen by the
[1:24:00] brooding of the holy ghost by the holy
[1:24:02] spirit working in our lives creating the
[1:24:04] right atmosphere that god can part the
[1:24:07] waters and let the light strike the seed
[1:24:11] amen we can't i tell you it'd be a shame
[1:24:15] an absolute shame
[1:24:17] to have a home
[1:24:19] that's contrary to the word
[1:24:22] and expect our kids to be born again in
[1:24:25] the church service or at a camp
[1:24:31] when we have a we have kept them in the
[1:24:33] wrong atmosphere for how many years
[1:24:36] kept them in the wrong atmosphere
[1:24:38] entertained by the wrong things with the
[1:24:41] wrong kinds of discussion going on in
[1:24:43] the wrong attitudes
[1:24:45] and we expect that they can get
[1:24:48] a two-hour exposure to the right
[1:24:50] atmosphere that will wash out the weeks
[1:24:53] of bad atmosphere that we have in our
[1:24:55] home
[1:24:57] see we deceive ourselves by not getting
[1:24:59] in god's program we think god's just
[1:25:02] always going to cover it it's always no
[1:25:04] god has told us what to do and god is on
[1:25:06] partnership with man and he's given us
[1:25:08] instructions if we'll just do what he
[1:25:10] told us to do he'll do the part that we
[1:25:12] can't do
[1:25:15] what a shame it is the thing that we can
[1:25:17] send our kids to a youth meeting
[1:25:20] and that there the seed will come to
[1:25:21] life but at home we have arguing we're
[1:25:24] fussing we have criticism about amen
[1:25:27] others in the church
[1:25:29] amen we don't fully apply the token in
[1:25:31] our home we don't take what the prophet
[1:25:33] taught us but we mingle we mix
[1:25:36] we allow things he told us to throw out
[1:25:38] of our house we bring in things that he
[1:25:41] told us not to have
[1:25:43] we discuss things that are not godly
[1:25:46] and that's the atmosphere that that
[1:25:48] little seed has to sit in all the time
[1:25:50] and we wonder why sometimes they
[1:25:52] struggle and they struggle and they
[1:25:53] struggle i said god help us to create
[1:25:55] the right atmosphere at least help us to
[1:25:58] do our part if i've got the holy ghost
[1:26:00] in me i should be able to create a holy
[1:26:02] ghost environment in my house
[1:26:06] we should be able to create the right
[1:26:07] environment in our fellowships we should
[1:26:09] be able to create the right environment
[1:26:10] in our church services we should be able
[1:26:12] to create the right environment in our
[1:26:14] homes
[1:26:16] and if we can then we trust god to do
[1:26:18] the part that we can't do
[1:26:22] i i believe we need to be conscious of
[1:26:24] these things
[1:26:26] so much we just keep
[1:26:28] putting stuff over on god
[1:26:31] god you do this and you do this and you
[1:26:34] do that and god says but i sent a
[1:26:36] prophet in this day to teach you how to
[1:26:37] do that
[1:26:39] i taught you how to talk to your
[1:26:41] children i taught you how to have family
[1:26:43] devotions that family alter i taught you
[1:26:45] how to come into the church and create
[1:26:47] an atmosphere i taught you why do we
[1:26:49] keep shoveling off on god when god so
[1:26:51] graciously brought a prophet in our day
[1:26:53] to give it to us
[1:26:57] i say god
[1:26:58] teach me
[1:27:01] teach me god
[1:27:03] forgive me
[1:27:04] lord and teach me
[1:27:06] teach me how to let that spirit flow
[1:27:08] through me
[1:27:10] teach me how to change the atmosphere in
[1:27:13] my home teaching me how to speak
[1:27:16] positive instead of negative how to
[1:27:18] speak the word and display the word
[1:27:20] instead of allowing the world and the
[1:27:22] corruption of the world to constantly
[1:27:24] take over in my home
[1:27:26] help us god
[1:27:29] tell your friends
[1:27:31] god has given us so much
[1:27:35] but to whom much is given
[1:27:37] much is required
[1:27:39] there's never been an age that has as
[1:27:41] much light as we have or has been given
[1:27:43] such clear instruction from god on how
[1:27:45] to conduct almost every facet of our
[1:27:48] life
[1:27:50] how to conduct ourselves at work how to
[1:27:52] conduct ourselves between husband and
[1:27:53] wife how to conduct ourselves between
[1:27:55] parents and children how to act in the
[1:27:56] church how to treat believers we have
[1:27:59] been given so much instruction and
[1:28:01] demonstration in this age
[1:28:04] but too much is given much is required
[1:28:07] i think we can all say god help us
[1:28:10] help us do better lord help us to
[1:28:12] surrender help us to yield to your
[1:28:14] spirit
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:16] i want to see genuine new births taking
[1:28:19] place
[1:28:20] i want to see those seeds that are
[1:28:21] buried under the earth i want to see him
[1:28:22] come to life and i want to see him grow
[1:28:24] and i want to see him bearing fruit amen
[1:28:27] because that's what god had in his mind
[1:28:28] before the foundational world that's why
[1:28:30] they're sowed in this generation they're
[1:28:32] here to bring forth bride fruit amen
[1:28:34] fruit like unto jesus christ that's why
[1:28:36] they're here i want to see it in all of
[1:28:38] our young people all of our children all
[1:28:40] of our visitors everyone that comes in i
[1:28:42] want to see that seed come to life and i
[1:28:45] want to see it bear fruit amen
[1:28:48] we must keep it in the right atmosphere
[1:28:51] i remember it says something
[1:28:54] based off revelation chapter one let's
[1:28:56] turn there
[1:28:57] he says something in the church age book
[1:29:00] that i really enjoy
[1:29:03] and i've been meditating on it a lot
[1:29:06] and he takes it from
[1:29:08] revelation chapter 1. so turn there
[1:29:10] together
[1:29:16] revelation chapter 1
[1:29:19] verse 9.
[1:29:24] i john who also am your brother and
[1:29:26] companion in tribulation in in the
[1:29:28] kingdom and patience of jesus christ
[1:29:31] was in the aisle that has called patmos
[1:29:32] for the word of the lord and for the
[1:29:34] testimony of jesus christ
[1:29:36] and i was in the spirit on the lord's
[1:29:38] day and i heard behind me a great voice
[1:29:41] as of a trumpet
[1:29:43] and brother branham's going to refer to
[1:29:44] verse 10 here and he says i was in the
[1:29:47] spirit
[1:29:48] isn't that just beautiful
[1:29:51] my i love that you could just call those
[1:29:53] words the whole of the christian life
[1:29:57] i was in the spirit
[1:29:58] that's the phrase he's pointing out but
[1:30:01] john was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:30:03] but he says he just takes the phrase i
[1:30:05] was in the spirit and he said that could
[1:30:08] just
[1:30:09] we you could just call those words the
[1:30:11] whole of the christian life
[1:30:14] so what is the whole of the christian
[1:30:15] life supposed to be to be in the spirit
[1:30:19] if we are going to live as christians we
[1:30:21] have to be in his spirit
[1:30:24] john was not talking about being in his
[1:30:25] own spirit that would not have brought
[1:30:27] these visions it had to be the spirit of
[1:30:29] god it has to be the spirit of god with
[1:30:32] us too or all of our efforts are in vain
[1:30:35] paul said i will pray in the spirit i
[1:30:37] will sing in the spirit i will live in
[1:30:39] the spirit if there is anything good
[1:30:41] that will come to me it has to be
[1:30:43] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[1:30:45] word and made manifest by the results it
[1:30:48] bears
[1:30:49] as surely as john needed to be in the
[1:30:51] spirit to receive these tremendous
[1:30:52] revelations fresh from jesus we need to
[1:30:55] be in the spirit to understand the
[1:30:57] revelations that god has given to us to
[1:30:59] live by in his word for it is the same
[1:31:03] spirit
[1:31:06] we have to get in the spirit
[1:31:08] we have to live in the spirit
[1:31:11] but there's there's
[1:31:14] so many things have a spirit to it
[1:31:17] brother branham was talking here just
[1:31:19] past this in the church age book he says
[1:31:21] you see people go to a ball game or they
[1:31:23] go to a dance he says they can never
[1:31:25] enjoy it unless they get in the spirit
[1:31:27] of it
[1:31:29] you get in the spirit of the ball game
[1:31:30] you get in the spirit of the dance you
[1:31:32] get spirit of the race or you get in the
[1:31:33] spirit of whatever and when they get
[1:31:35] into the spirit of it amen they get
[1:31:37] caught up in it and they begin to enjoy
[1:31:39] it they become part of it amen and it
[1:31:41] brings them great joy and great pleasure
[1:31:43] because they got in the spirit of it
[1:31:46] but is it just like that we have to get
[1:31:48] into the spirit of this word amen we
[1:31:50] must get in the spirit which means how
[1:31:53] many how do you get into the spirit of
[1:31:54] the ball game amen you know what if
[1:31:57] somebody has zero interest in baseball
[1:31:59] they don't know who the players are they
[1:32:01] don't know who the teams are they don't
[1:32:02] know how to keep score they don't know
[1:32:04] what's happening they mean they show up
[1:32:06] at a ball game and they're gonna be like
[1:32:10] everybody's cheering what are you
[1:32:12] cheering for
[1:32:13] that was a home run
[1:32:15] is that a good thing
[1:32:20] i mean he just struck out the whole side
[1:32:22] on the inning is that that's good right
[1:32:24] that's good
[1:32:27] you don't you're not in the spirit of it
[1:32:29] you don't know what's going on you don't
[1:32:31] know what everybody's rejoicing about i
[1:32:33] mean you've got to get in the spirit of
[1:32:35] it and if we want to get in the spirit
[1:32:36] this day we've got to get into the
[1:32:38] message of the hour we've got to know
[1:32:40] what everybody's cheering about we got
[1:32:42] to be in prayer we got to ask god to
[1:32:44] change us change our mind change our
[1:32:46] thoughts change our desires get us lined
[1:32:48] up with this bride word for this day
[1:32:51] amen or else everybody else is talking
[1:32:52] about the message and talking about the
[1:32:54] bride amen and you're trying to cheer
[1:32:56] when others are cheering but you don't
[1:32:57] always know what others are cheering
[1:32:59] about
[1:33:04] you've got to get in the spirit
[1:33:07] we got to get in the spirit of this word
[1:33:10] we got to spend time we have to know who
[1:33:13] the players are
[1:33:16] we have to know uh
[1:33:18] how long has this rivalry been going on
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:26] we have to know who the players are we
[1:33:28] have to know amen what's happened before
[1:33:31] and what's going on and
[1:33:33] and how god has brought the word through
[1:33:35] seven church ages but now in this day he
[1:33:37] has unlocked the mystery that's been in
[1:33:39] the back of his mind and what does that
[1:33:41] even mean amen he's brought to us the
[1:33:43] fullness of redemption what does that
[1:33:44] even mean amen we're
[1:33:46] what are we excited about amen what is
[1:33:49] happening what's going on all around us
[1:33:51] amen we've got to get into the spirit of
[1:33:53] this thing we've got to say god show me
[1:33:55] your word reveal it to me we got to read
[1:33:58] the message we got to listen to the
[1:34:00] prophet's voice we got to fellowship
[1:34:01] about these things and when we get into
[1:34:03] the spirit of it amen it begins to
[1:34:05] manifest in our life and we have
[1:34:07] tremendous joy about the word of god
[1:34:10] we're no longer the outsider trying to
[1:34:12] fit in amen but we're right in we've got
[1:34:15] into the spirit of it amen when they go
[1:34:17] to the dance amen they let the music
[1:34:19] start to move them they get out on the
[1:34:20] dance floor they they get into the
[1:34:22] rhythm of it and they begin to enjoy it
[1:34:24] amen there's a symphony going on now and
[1:34:26] there's a rhythm to the music that god
[1:34:28] is playing because god is he has
[1:34:30] promised to restore all that those uh
[1:34:33] those four creatures ate to restore the
[1:34:35] bride back it fell almost in ruin amen
[1:34:39] all the way back in the dark ages amen
[1:34:41] what god brought forth at pentecost was
[1:34:44] supposed to grow into the perfect church
[1:34:46] but it began to decline amen and almost
[1:34:49] was wiped out in the dark ages but there
[1:34:51] was a prophecy i will restore saith the
[1:34:54] lord what's he restoring he's bringing
[1:34:57] back the bride tree
[1:35:01] is that something to get excited about
[1:35:02] brother chad
[1:35:04] it just depends on if you're in the
[1:35:05] spirit or not
[1:35:06] right
[1:35:09] what does that mean for me get in the
[1:35:11] spirit and you'll find out
[1:35:14] we've got to
[1:35:15] give ourselves
[1:35:17] to this word
[1:35:20] give ourselves to this message
[1:35:23] and quit giving ourselves to everything
[1:35:25] else that's coming down the pike we give
[1:35:28] ourselves to every other fad and and
[1:35:30] every other thing that's going around we
[1:35:33] need to give ourselves to this message
[1:35:35] to the word of god for our day and say
[1:35:38] lord let your spirit let me get into the
[1:35:40] spirit of this word
[1:35:42] to where i can be that bride that you're
[1:35:45] looking for
[1:35:47] the holy ghost has been brooding
[1:35:50] over the last
[1:35:51] the last church ages he's been brooding
[1:35:53] what's he been brooding for what's the
[1:35:55] holy ghost brooding what's it cooing
[1:35:56] what's it hovering over the church for
[1:35:59] it's trying to bring back the second
[1:36:01] part of the masterpiece
[1:36:04] it was brooding over the old testaments
[1:36:05] to bring back another son of god in the
[1:36:08] image of god and it brought jesus christ
[1:36:10] the perfect reflection of god
[1:36:12] the last adam the son of god restored
[1:36:16] but there was another part to that logos
[1:36:19] there was a bride
[1:36:21] and now he's been brooding brooding watt
[1:36:24] creating bringing the word creating the
[1:36:26] atmosphere amen parting the waters
[1:36:29] bringing up life what's he bringing he's
[1:36:31] bringing back the other part of the he's
[1:36:33] bringing back the bride tree he's
[1:36:35] bringing back the other part of the tree
[1:36:37] of life
[1:36:39] because they're male and female
[1:36:44] and he's brooding and bringing back
[1:36:46] what's he doing the same thing he did in
[1:36:48] genesis he brewed it and brooded and
[1:36:50] brewed it till he brought something up
[1:36:52] that reflected his very image
[1:36:54] and now the holy ghost is brooding over
[1:36:57] the bride over the church to bring a
[1:36:59] bride that'll be in his very image
[1:37:02] a perfect reflection of jesus christ
[1:37:05] and the formation of a bride
[1:37:09] and we have to get in that spirit
[1:37:12] and the spirit of that revelation
[1:37:15] and create that atmosphere around us
[1:37:18] and watch it change our lives
[1:37:20] and not just ours
[1:37:22] watch it change other people's lives
[1:37:26] i want to get in the spirit of this word
[1:37:29] means that i must surrender myself to it
[1:37:34] i must spend time seeking the lord
[1:37:38] i can't just live life running from
[1:37:40] pillar to post i've got to stop and
[1:37:43] spend time with god
[1:37:44] i got to get into the spirit of things
[1:37:47] this is a busy world
[1:37:49] and we all feel the time constraints and
[1:37:51] crunch of a busy world but if i'm going
[1:37:53] to get into the spirit of this i've got
[1:37:55] to have time
[1:37:57] to get into the spirit
[1:38:00] i've got to have time to pray
[1:38:03] and seek god's face
[1:38:05] i have to have time to spend seeking
[1:38:08] after the lord
[1:38:10] and letting him change me
[1:38:12] we have to have time to pray
[1:38:14] friends it seems like such an odd thing
[1:38:17] to have to say to christian people but
[1:38:19] the world we live in is trying to steal
[1:38:21] every spare moment we have
[1:38:24] and trying to strip us from the very
[1:38:26] things that gives us the most strength
[1:38:30] to chase after things that never yield
[1:38:32] strength
[1:38:35] chasing after another accomplishment or
[1:38:37] finishing another task or getting
[1:38:39] something else done or another project
[1:38:41] and we always think after this i mean
[1:38:43] how many times have i told myself after
[1:38:45] this i'll slow down
[1:38:47] after this i'll get in a better routine
[1:38:49] after this after this guess what what
[1:38:52] comes after this another thing
[1:38:56] until we've got to get to the place and
[1:38:57] says i am not giving myself to this i'm
[1:39:01] yielding myself to the spirit of god i'm
[1:39:03] going to stop and say god i'm taking
[1:39:05] this time and i'm seeking your face
[1:39:08] because i need a strength and i need to
[1:39:11] create an atmosphere
[1:39:12] that i can't do running all over the
[1:39:14] place
[1:39:16] and i need time listen friends we need
[1:39:19] time to read this bible
[1:39:24] it seems odd that we're the bride of
[1:39:27] jesus christ we have to tell ourselves
[1:39:29] this but this is the life that we live
[1:39:31] in we have to dedicate time to read this
[1:39:34] bible
[1:39:35] we have to read the message we have to
[1:39:37] hear the voice of the prophet and we
[1:39:39] can't always do it when we're on the run
[1:39:42] sometimes we need to sit down and spend
[1:39:45] time with the word
[1:39:49] get into the spirit of it because i
[1:39:51] promise you it's the only thing that's
[1:39:53] going to keep us in this day
[1:39:57] we all get too busy we all
[1:40:00] i mean maybe some of you are blessed in
[1:40:03] a position of life where you can have a
[1:40:04] little more time if you do use it for
[1:40:07] the kingdom of god
[1:40:09] use it be in prayer for your brothers
[1:40:11] and sisters intercede for them spend
[1:40:13] time praying for the services amen
[1:40:15] reaching out to others those that life
[1:40:17] is full have children have work and have
[1:40:19] all that you must diligently carve out
[1:40:22] some time and say i'm not giving this
[1:40:24] time away anymore i must seek his face i
[1:40:28] must get into the spirits amen
[1:40:31] and be diligent about it
[1:40:34] this is an evil wicked world we live in
[1:40:38] and we must be constantly surrendered to
[1:40:42] the word
[1:40:43] we must get in the spirit
[1:40:45] and let the spirit of god brood over us
[1:40:49] in drawing us
[1:40:51] to a higher life
[1:40:53] to a higher life
[1:40:54] to a higher life
[1:40:56] until we can bring to us into the very
[1:40:58] reflection
[1:41:00] of jesus christ himself
[1:41:03] that's the day and age we live in
[1:41:06] we must
[1:41:07] create an atmosphere

[1:41:10] surrender all
[1:41:13] i say go on
[1:41:15] help me
[1:41:17] help me god
[1:41:20] we're not a people who want to have the
[1:41:22] wrong atmosphere
[1:41:25] we're not a people who want to be
[1:41:27] chasing the world
[1:41:29] this is the devil's satan's eden
[1:41:33] but we're a people who say god
[1:41:36] come and take this vessel
[1:41:38] under your control
[1:41:42] how many just want to say god
[1:41:44] i need help

[1:41:57] given us and instructed us in this
[1:41:58] message
[1:42:00] and i don't want to be dilatory but i
[1:42:02] want to be diligent
[1:42:05] i want to be found faithful
[1:42:08] brother branham he comes to the book of
[1:42:09] revelations and he talks about the one
[1:42:12] riding on the white horse and he says
[1:42:14] behind him follow those the army of god
[1:42:17] who are uh called
[1:42:20] faithful and chosen
[1:42:22] he said they're called he said they're
[1:42:25] chosen by god you didn't do that
[1:42:27] yourself
[1:42:28] but he said they're faithful by their
[1:42:31] own choosing
[1:42:33] i said god that's who i want to be i
[1:42:35] want to be faithful by my own choosing
[1:42:39] the day is wicked and i believe the day
[1:42:41] is short
[1:42:43] and i want to create such an atmosphere
[1:42:46] around me
[1:42:47] and an atmosphere in this place
[1:42:49] that'll have an effect on unbelievers
[1:42:54] amen god has been so
[1:42:56] good to us
[1:42:58] he has been so faithful especially in
[1:43:01] this assembly he's been so good to us
[1:43:02] he's rescued for us from where we were
[1:43:04] and brought us into a different place
[1:43:06] than where we were
[1:43:07] and we've we've we've we've went through
[1:43:10] a revival back to the word back reviving
[1:43:13] the life within us amen but there's
[1:43:16] always a cycle of revival and death that
[1:43:18] has to be broken in the end time
[1:43:21] and there's got to be a revival unto
[1:43:23] life not unto another denominational
[1:43:25] revival but one that will go from life
[1:43:27] into life and the life and the life from
[1:43:29] word and to word unto word from
[1:43:31] manifestation unto manifestation until
[1:43:33] the final manifestation and there's a
[1:43:35] change of the body
[1:43:37] this is not time to slip back into a
[1:43:39] relaxed state and it's not time amen to
[1:43:42] to stop laboring in the word and
[1:43:45] creating an atmosphere getting in the

[1:44:07] people to float along in a good church
