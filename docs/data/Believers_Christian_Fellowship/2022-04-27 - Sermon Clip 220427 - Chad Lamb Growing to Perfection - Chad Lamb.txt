TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it helps to know what we're here for it helps to know what god's doing in our lives why the tribe without this kind of understanding that the prophet gave us then our life is just a bunch of difficult circumstances string together amen we can't wait to get out of here i just want to die and go to the sixth dimension because we don't understand what god is doing the father wants to bring us into a position amen he wants to place us in the inheritance in the kingdom and he wants us to speak like he would speak on this earth he wants us to lay hands on the sick and pray for him he wants us to speak he wants us to share the word he wants us to give the revelation he wants us to prophesy again he wants us to speak but if you don't know what's going on you say well i believe the message i receive the baptism the holy ghost praise god and then the rest of our life is is aimless the rest of our life is confusion the rest of our life is we have good days and then we have bad days and we don't understand the bad days but we thank god for the good days and we always pray for another good day and then something bad happens and we're like why is all this bad stuff happening to me because we don't realize that you've been ordained predestinated unto adoption you've been predestined to have every virtue of christ flowing in your life and flowing out from you and he's got to put it to the test so that you learn the lesson so that he can draw out the virtue and without this teaching our life becomes just life just routine broke up by a few highlights and some difficult things we cry sometimes and we laugh sometimes and not in the understanding that god wants a people on this earth that'll speak like he speaks act like he lacks be whatever he is she will be him amen this is the age of adoption and he has brought the church unto adoption under this ministry now as individuals he wants us to come to the same place but we have to know what's going on what did he save me for why did i receive the holy ghost what was my experience with him even about it's because he wants another messiah on this earth
