our lives as we surrender completely to you open our eyes of understanding open our hearts to receive all that you have for us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you it's good to be together this evening while we're standing let's look at John chapter 1 together in our Bibles and as we do I just want to remind you that not this Sunday but the following Sunday will be watch night we'll be uh we'll have a watch Night Service in the evening we'll have our regular morning service in the morning and then we'll come back at 8:30 p.m. for the watch Night Service so if you have a special for us it's our it's our tradition to have a lot of specials and testimonies and a good time together so if you've got a special amen please get with brother Mike and let him know so he can get that to the song leader amen uh also I walked by the welcome desk and saw that there's still some candy left over from India so hey you got another chance if you missed out on Sunday you got another chance to grab some before it's gone amen let's read from John chapter 1 this evening John chapter 1 verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not amen God bless you as you have your seats amen there's some scriptures we just read again and again and I don't think we could ever exhaust them there's depths here that we have not yet explored there there's the the word of God is eternal and and every verse can be a portal into the Eternal thoughts of God amen and as we look here I want to focus on um verse four in him was life and the life was the light of men and who was life this we know this is speaking of Christ but it's saying the word in the beginning amen was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so we know we're speaking of Christ Christ the word amen is the Son of God Amen and in him was life in who in the word was life and the life was the light of men amen so I want to speak this evening I just want to do some teaching on a subject of true life and true death amen true life and true death amen we talk about life and death all the time but what we speak of of life and death is not true life and true death there only semblances or Shadows or types of life and death so we we we refer to life we refer to death but actually I want to look at what is true life and what is true death amen uh when we look at the the message brother B says and sir we would see Jesus said God is life life eternal in the beginning was God he wasn't God at that time because God the English word god means object of worship and there wasn't nothing but him he was the Eternal just the Eternal one so when God was alone we know God dwelt Alone with his thoughts and before there was anything there was God Amen and he didn't even have the title of God cuz there's nothing to worship him he was Elohim he was the great self-existing one I mean nothing kept him he he was everything amen before there was anything it was God or what we call God Elohim and that is life amen that that is the origination of everything everything comes out of Elohim there's nothing before him but everything is after him he doesn't come from anything but everything comes from him so when you go all the way back to the origin you go back to Elohim we go back to God and that is eternal life that is life that's why brother Benham said God is life amen so we want to know what life is we just go all the way back to the origin and you go back to the origin it's God God is life amen and we want to know what true life is that's it amen and so uh brother Ram says and who is this melkisedek he said notice now his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us St John the first chapter in the first verse notice it said in the beginning but before the Eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word amen just to just to review this and just to talk about it before we move on Amen when God was alone he brother B said he was alone with his thoughts amen uh God consisted of his thoughts and he was alone with the thoughts about himself about how he would Express himself amen and how that expression would become material so that that thought was God the Eternal amen when God began to express himself amen the first thing that came forth from him brother B said was the logos amen and the form of a a great light that light began to move out and it came from the Father the logos and which that word logos is just the Greek word of word when we said in the beginning was the word the Greek word is logos so out from the expression the first expression from God is word because a thought expressed his word amen so when God began to express himself the first thing that came forth was the word his thought expressed amen and that word he called son because it came from the father so out from the originator the father comes the word and when it comes forth or its birth or or it comes from the father he calls it son and in him is life amen why is life in him because this word logos means the word with the concept or the thought amen it's not just a word that you just pick up and read amen but this word is attached back to the thought it contains within it the concept or thought of that word so if the thought is in the word then life is in the word because the thought was God and is eternal so when the thoughts expressed and now the thought comes with the the word amen then there's life in that word I hope I hope that's understandable amen I'm not trying to get it too deep or too complicated just so that we understand amen these things that the prophet of God taught us that is life because life is God and God was before anything when he was alone with his thoughts God consisted of his thoughts now when God wants to express that thought has to move from the invisible from the unknown from the darkness of mystery and when it first begins to form brother why does brother say it forms as a light amen because all through the Bible light means illumination means understanding amen understanding of what understanding what's back here in the darkness in the mind of God that nobody understood so as God begins to express himself amen it's typed with light amen because light has to do with understanding when you're enlightened you understand something so we've used this analogy before if we go into a dark room pitch black dark no light whatsoever not even a sliver of light so dark you can't see anything amen you have absolutely no understanding or no knowledge of the room you're standing in you don't know where the pieces of furniture are you don't know where the doors or the windows are you don't know anything you're just standing in a darkened room you don't know if there's other people in the room you don't know anything about the you don't know the dimensions you don't know the height you know nothing you're an absolute ignorance and total darkness yeah but the minute somebody flips on the switch the very fraction of a second in less than a second you know all things I mean the the second the light hit your eyes you know how many people in the room you know how high it is you know how wide it is you know the color of paint you know the furniture that's there you know where the door is you know so much information the moment you receive that Revelation all of a sudden so much comes to your understanding that's the difference between light and dark amen this is a theme that runs through the Bible amen and and when we think of light and dark the natural light and dark that we understand is only a type so that we can begin to understand what light and dark actually is amen light and dark actually is understanding of God and no understanding of God that's the reality what we have now is a reflection of that down into this Dimension so that we have terms that we can use to understand these things it's a way God teaches us through the natural world but this natural world we know is just a vapor this is the negative this isn't the reality this is the Mist amen so now as that great darkness of no understanding of God God dwelling alone when he begins to express so that he can be known what we see is we see a light because light is illumination light is understanding God begins to move as a light and this is the sun this is the word and because it contains the thought of God it has life in it let's turn to John chapter 6 I want to read through quite a few scriptures as we move forward John 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen the words that Jesus was speaking why because those words contain the thought of God he says I speak nothing but what the father tells me amen he got the Revelation from the Father the thought of God and he went to speak that and when he spoke that word that was spirit and that was life it had the life of God in the spoken word because it was the thought of God being expressed let's let's flip over to First John all the way over near Revelation over to First John chapter 5 1 John chapter 5 and verse 11 and this is the record that God has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son why is that because his son is the word amen Jesus Christ is the word the word made manifest is Christ the anointed word and in him is life amen he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life am remember we want to talk about what is true life and what is true death let's while we're back here let's go to James James chap 4:14 James 4 And1 14 James 4:14 says whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanisheth away James is speaking of your natural life what is your life it's just a fleeting moment it's just a vapor that that vanishes away that's what this natural life is that's not true life that's our Natural Life brother Brenham says this is the negative the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there's a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come oh praise be to God that what is your life it's the vapor of a Mist but there's more to life than this amen this can't be all there is to life amen you live 80 90 years you pass away you go into the grave this is what job was struggling with what is the life of a man what is a man what is this cycle of life this is just the vapor this is just the shadow this isn't real life amen breathing oxygen in and out of your lungs that's not life that's a type of life so you can understand what life is but that's not actual life life is God Amen God is life Amen brother fro if we could pull up the Whiteboard I'm going to uh jot a few things down here as we as we move forward but let's turn to John chap 11 as we do that John chap 11 John 11:1 these things said he after that they saith in him our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he doeth he shall do well how be Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest and sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead amen when brother bam comes to this section of scripture brother bam says uh Jesus spoke right he said Lazarus sleepeth but they misunderstood what he meant and they thought oh well if Lazarus is sleeping he's recovering he's doing well he's no longer suffering everything's fine and then and he can't get them to understand because they're trapped in this carnal world Amen dark to the things of God to the actual realities they think that this Dimension is the reality amen and they're not understanding brother bram's language so brother Jesus's language so brother bam said Jesus had to put it in languages and terms they would understand and he said Lazarus is dead amen but Jesus already said Lazarus sleep cuz Lazarus not dead Lazarus is a Son of God he's an eternal Gene of God Lazarus cannot die amen so so when we start writing this down here we want to write God is life so we want to start talking about true life we got to go all the way back here amen amen and wherever God is is life so when the word came forth amen when the thought of God was in that word then life was in him when Jesus spoke the thoughts of God became the spoken word of God life was there Jesus said the word I speak unto you there spirit and there are life amen so God is life so now we come to death what is death amen and and Jesus he begins to speak about Lazarus Lazarus is sick and and and his sister sin for Jesus the one you love is is sick and he's going to come and they want him to come and and and heal his body and now Jesus delays and he waits because God's got another purpose in all of this amen and he waits till Lazarus quits breathing oxygen in and out and his body is no longer animate and they take the body and they lay it in a grave but Jesus doesn't consider that death right amen Jesus has a different perspective than an Earthly perspective he's got a Heavenly perspective and my goodness the message is coming our day to change our perspective from the Earthly perspective to the Heavenly perspective so that we begin to to treat these things differently and have a different understanding because we've been brought up On Eagle's Wings and lifted above the Earth so that give an eyesight that we can see that we're not trapped in this Vapor trapped in this mist and stuck in the in the boundaries of this physical but we can escape the boundaries of this physical and move into the Supernatural and say hey they're not dead they're asleep slint Saints don't die they can't die amen so what we call death isn't true death that's right what we call death is a semblance of death or a type of death or a shadow of death but it's not really death amen amen so Jesus had to start speaking their language hey I don't want to live in the day where Jesus has to come down to my Earthly language but I want to start speaking his language right amen let's look at Luke 8 together Luke 8 verse 49 Luke 8:49 he says well he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master but when Jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maiden and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth the servant already come and says she's dead trouble not the master Jesus says no she's she sleepeth she's not dead and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead W they thought they knew more than the Son of God they laugh here comes the word made flesh amen God in flesh the word amen the fullness of the word made flesh embodied in flesh is standing on the earth and the word says she's not dead but sleepeth and they laughed the word to scorn knowing that she was dead what did they know they knew nothing amen they were their minds were darkened they were alienated from the things of God their mind were totally blackened to the realities and their mind was only open to this Dimension which was Darkness compared to the reality and they laughed him the scar knowing she was dead they didn't know nothing oh I don't want to have this kind of knowledge I want to have a Heavenly knowledge praise be to God and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead and he put put them all out and took her by the hand and called her saying made arise and her spirit came again and she arose straight way and he commanded to give her meat and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done oh praise be to God he knew that she wasn't dead amen although that body was laying there lifeless there was no more breath no more what humans call life was there he me she was not dead he knew knew where her spirit was he knew he could call that Spirit back to that body and when that Spirit come back to that body that she would raise again he knew where she was he knew how to find her and he knew how to call her back amen so we know that death is not what we think death is amen amen let's go let's let's now look at Mark chap 12 I just want to grab these places in scripture and lay a scriptural principle down and keep moving from there we find it's it's so amazing that that in the message brother brandham says some things that are so odd and so contrary to our natural intellect so odd and contrary to our human reasoning but that's exactly how Jesus spoke he said things that were so unusual so different than the regular dialogue of that day he he people who they knew we dead he said we're not dead they're sleeping right amen and we find that the prophet is so scriptural in his approach and in his style amen because we know that it was God working through that prophet and so Mark 12 verse 26 he says there Jesus was asked a question by the Sadducees about a a man you know they didn't believe in the resurrection so they asked him a hard question I love this they come to Jesus to ask him a stumper I mean we're going to floor him with this one and here again they're so darkened amen their understanding so darkened here is the word the word made flesh is standing there the word is there and they're challenging the word with their own stomping questions amen I got a tough one for him how can you have a tough question for the word I said okay speaking of the Resurrection now there was a man he had a wife and before that she had a child he died but the law says that her her brother shouldn't go in unto her to raise up seed for the dead now she has the brother now before there's a seed raised up that brother dies and another one another one until all seven brothers had her to wife no seed was raised up all seven die and I said in the resurrection answer this one yeah Mr Jesus see the foolishness of man's thinking you know so many times we've got tough questions for the message tough questions like if that's right then what about this and what about that listen we don't know nothing there's no tough question for the message amen this message came from God it is the word of God it is the true revelation of the true word of God and you think your tough questions is going to stump God the problem is between the ears amen not with the message and not with the Bible their problem was not with the resurrection their problem was the the gray matter between their ears and the Sadducees couldn't figure it out and because they couldn't figure it out they're looking completely with a natural Earthly perspective and that's so many times why we get stumped in the message is because we're thinking low thinking Earthly thinking time matter space sequence of events all the things we understand and the natural and we're not thinking from ahead Heavenly perspective but this message came to lift us out of Leo deia Lift Us above the carnality and bring us back into the mind of God so that the mind of Christ would be in you amen not the carnal Mind of a man but the mind of Christ will be in you with the true interpretation and revelation of the word where we don't have to ask these stumping questions of the message so here the Sadducees had one that was going to stump the word so now in the resurrection amen if you believe in in the resurrection how is she going to have seven husbands in the resurrection and look at what Jesus does he knows the real problem listen the real problem is not the husbands the real problem is they don't believe in the resurrection amen so they're trying to disprove the resurrection with a difficult question about all of these circumstances that don't matter at all amen he says in verse 24 and then Jesus answered and said them do you not therefore he because you know not the scriptures neither the power of God Amen for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the Angels which are in heaven when Jesus he says when they resurrect they're not going to resurrect with carnal bodies to bring forth a carnal seed like they did in this it's all together different you don't even understand the scriptures or the power of God Amen you're asking a question from down here but there's a whole another understanding up here amen so now he he dealt with that question easily they've got a different kind of body all together and they have a different kind of Desire all together and it's not like what you think then he goes to verse 26 and as touching the Dead that they rise have you not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spake unto him saying I am the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly he what's he saying he's saying didn't you even read your Bible yeah right don't you even know the scriptures amen he says did Moses didn't he say to Moses in the burning bush I am present tense I am present tense the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob amen if Jesus says I am he's speaking present tense that means he said he didn't say I was the god of Abraham because if Abraham was dead he would have said I was the god of Abraham Jacob's dead I was the god of Jacob but Abraham was very much alive when he was speaking to Moses and he said I am present tense right now the god of Abraham who is alive somewhere else he may not be breathing oxygen in and out he may not have amen this body animate and moving it may be turning to dust somewhere in a cave and and and a cave in in Hein but it doesn't change anything about whether or not Abraham's alive or not and when he said I am the god of Abraham he was saying I am the god of a living Abraham who's living right now that was Jesus's answer to the Sadducees so simple he could take the simplest scripture they all knew and probably learned as a memory verse at Sunday school all these great theologians and Sadducees they probably knew the story of Moses and the burning bush I mean even those who are in Israel who probably were illiterate knew that story yeah yeah amen and he goes right to a scripture they all know and proves that the dead are alive so what's the problem with the resurrection if they're not actually dead oh I love it when people think they're going to stump the word ah now I've got a question for you listen you may stump me but you never stump this word amen and your questions will never stop this message it's the word of God am man you remember when Saul King Saul got in trouble and he he was worried about his future he went to the winch of indor and the winch did what she called up Samuel Samuel wasn't dead Samuel had departed this Earth this Dimension he had left his body was rotting away he had no more breath in his lungs he he had no more animation in this body but Samuel was every bit alive as he has always been Samuel was no more dead than anything he was very much alive and his character was the same his temperament was the same and his office by God was the same he was still a prophet nothing had changed with Samuel except his Dwelling Place nothing else had changed what we call life is not life and we call death is not death amen I just love I love the word of God I love it because amen we have to stop for a minute and let the word reshape our thinking amen it says in the fourth seal brother BM says death is eternal separation so remember Saints don't die they sleep not die he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life that's that's right shall not come into the Judgment but pass from death into life I am the resurrection and the life said Jesus he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen says Lazarus dead he sleepeth fear not the girl is not dead but sleepeth they laugh him the scorn is that right oh my Saints don't die separation from God is death Eternal death and this fellow is called death so keep away from him and which my brother R referring to he's in the fourth seal and he's referring to the Antichrist he's referring to the fourth horse rider amen and the fourth horse rider riding the Pale Horse finally got a name it was the same horse rider all the way through he was changing his horses amen from a white horse to a black horse to a red horse now he's riding the Pale Horse and his name is death and what is he he's the Antichrist yeah is that right so the anti christ name is death and Christ is life cuz in in him is life amen and brother B said in the same in the same seal in the fourth seal he says now Jesus comes and and referring to Revelations 19 riding on a white horse and he said he's got a name that's life but if you go and read Revelations 19 amen there never says that his name is life in Revelations 19 it says his name is the word of God because in the word is life according to John 1:1 or John 13 or 4 whichever one it is so brother banham when he reads that and says on his thigh and on his vesture is a name written and on his thigh and his name is called the word of God brother Brenham says he comes with the name of life amen the Antichrist has the name of death but Christ has the name of Life why because he's the word and the word came from God and the Word was God Amen the word contained the thought of God so there was life life there amen but anything contrary to the word is death so Antichrist is death because death is anti- word right amen so what is life and death life is to align with the word death is to separate from the word it becomes so simple so let's let's write this down God is life and we know that life is in the word because he said in him was life so the word brings life Jesus said that his words were spirit and life so now we see what life is yeah amen life the original is God himself God is eternal life Zoey life is God's own life and as that life comes down into expression whatever contains the original thought of God also contains life all the attributes that were in God's thinking which is his family which are his children they also are part of eternal life and they are life they have life and life is in them because they're part of God now let's go over here to death brother brandom says death is separation this is the definition that he gives us and it's really interesting how he gives it to us so now we speak of when when this body fails to exist we stop breathing oxygen we're no longer animated amen the the soul leaves the body the spirit leaves the body and we say that's dead that's not a that's not a bad term it's not wrong to use that the Bible even uses that term because if you take death as separation then if you go to look at let's look at physical death physical death is when your soul is separated from the body got that yeah so death is separation So Physical death is when your soul separates from your body now that's physical death right that's not real death because that Soul's still alive right yeah just because the soul separated from the body doesn't mean the soul died yeah the soul is still alive amen so that's not true death that's not Ultimate Death death that's not the end of death so that means physical death is a shadow of death or a type of death right now let's go to spiritual death and we're going to explain all of these spiritual death is when your soul is separated from God you know we're born spiritually dead yeah amen we'll look at the scriptures that show us that why cuz our soul has to come in contact with God to Quicken the life amen now let's look at Eternal death so brother B says was our soul is destroyed in the Lake of Fire Eternal death is when our soul is destroyed and that's eternally separated from God what is death death is separation from Life the Antichrist is death because the Antichrist is to separate you from Christ whose life amen Christ is life Antichrist is death amen let's look at 1 Timothy 56 1 Timothy Chapter 5 in verse 6 says but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth so she's very much alive but she's dead is she alive or dead amen you see the Dilemma she's living in pleasure but she's dead while she's alive amen what's she dead to she's spiritually dead she may have life in this Dimension she may be breathing amen she may be animated but but God says she's dead amen the woman that liveth in she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth amen now let's go to Matthew 8 Matthew chapter 8 and verse 21 Matthew 8:21 says and another of his disciples said unto himl suffer me first to go bury my father but Jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead Let the dead bury their dead right that's interesting if you do from a carnal understanding amen I can hear somebody just hearing Jesus say Let the dead bury the dead how are dead people going to take shovels and dig a hole amen they're dead how will they dig the hole to bury the dead how can the dead bury the dead so there must be some dead people who can dig holes still amen if any if if Jesus if he says what he says and means what he means and what he means makes sense we have to have another understanding other than the carnal understanding of what he's talking about because there have to be dead people that are able to bury dead people there's a dead man amen that can dig a shovel amen he looks alive he's breathing Amen in one sense of the word he's alive but in the truest sense of the word he's dead amen and he says just follow me Let the dead bury the dead and what is he speaking of he's speaking of those spiritually dead because their soul is separated from God let those that are dead bury those that aren't breathing anymore right Let the dead bury the dead see our whole understanding of life and death is so much more Superior than it used to be amen God brother bam says in the message pardon now the word death means separation when we die this way it does not mean our physical death does not mean that we are dead Jesus said he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die now that death speaking of here is separation from the presence of God but the physical death that we have to go through here yet is not death we're still in the presence of God we've moved from this place to a closer place with him in his presence it isn't the death that we call death what we call it here amen now let's go to Luke 16 Luke 16 and 22 we we know these scriptures we all know them so well but I want to go through each one of us because I want us to have a scriptural understanding of what we're talking about because this is so solid through the scriptures Luke 16:22 sorry I'm in Matthew that doesn't work Luke 16 and 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom and the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torment and seeth Abram Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and saith Father Abraham have Merc mercy on me and send Lazarus that he might dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great Gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from then so here we have two men that die but they're not dead listen I I love oh my goodness let's read verse 22 again and it came to pass that the beggar died which is Lazarus amen and the rich man also died next verse and hell he lifted up his eyes and started talking he could see he could hear he could talk he wasn't dead he only left this Dimension amen he was still moving his body lay dead but he himself was very much alive and he was in one place and Lazarus was in another place and he could lift up his eyes being in torment and he could see Lazarus in Abraham's bosom and he could have a dialogue with Abraham he had reasoning he had eyesight he had sense of hearing amen he he he could speak he could feel torment he was hot Lazarus was comforted they weren't dead they were alive so this life after death is not just for the saints of God it's not just like the children of God are alive when they leave this earth everyone's still alive when they leave this earth some are alive some are dead alive and some are dead dead and while we're in this life amen some some are alive alive and some are dead dead and some are Dead Alive I don't I can't figure it all out in this life they're alive in this life and alive in the spirit some are alive in this life and dead in the spirit then when they both die you have one that's dead in the flesh but alive in the spirit you have another one that's dead in the flesh and still dead in the spirit but can talk and see and hear God amen amen am men things are not what they appear this is so much more than what we realize amen we could be alive we could be dead and it doesn't look any different then both are dead two caskets but they could be having a dialogue yeah right in another dimension amen praise God brother B said death means separation he only separates from our seeing but he's always alive he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into condemnation but is passed from death into life oh I believe that we can't die got eternal life eternal anything's Eternal never had a beginning or an end so that's God's own life eternal life comes from the Greek word Zoey which means God's own life and when we come Sons and Daughters of God the we live just as God Lives can no more die than he can die so we're part of him part of his life because we were part of the thought of god let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians chapter 2 Ephesians 2 and 1 Ephesians 2 And1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins amen what kind of dead was that that's when your soul was separated from the life of God you were dead in sins and trespasses you were walking on the earth you were breathing you were eating your meals you were talking to everybody but you were dead in sins and trespasses but he has quickened you amen amen and you have the quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and ha raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Hey listen friends I was dead but now I'm alive amen and not just alive but I want to confess to you now that I'm not just standing here behind this Pulpit but I'm seated in Heavenly place in Christ Jesus amen made so alive I've been quickened together with Christ it's far beyond what we see amen amen we we've come to life we were born in sin we were born dead through the things of God we were born with our mind darken to the things of God but by the grace of God he would come and he would flip on the switch there was a man that could turn on the light and when he turned on the light all of a sudden we could see and he quickened us who were dead in trespasses and and quickened us to life and we were alive and caught up and seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you can never die you were already dead but men Made Alive let's go to chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 verse 17 Ephesians 4:17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart what were they they were blind they were darkened they were darkened in their mind they were alien what were they alienated from they were alienated from the life of God so what were they they were dead because they were SE their soul was separated from the life of Goden but oh if your soul with a siede of of God and it ever comes in contact with that life of God again it'll Quicken you to life who were dead in trespasses and sin that's real life after that it doesn't matter anymore that happens to this life once we understand what life and death really is amen the devil can no more torment you with the fear of death which was the strength of sin which tormented men all their Liv it was job's torment it was his question it was it was a fear that was cast Over mankind but fear has been eliminated by genuine Life coming to us and now the devil can't torment us with death if you if you cause this body to die you only set my life free to live the better life you freed me from my chains of flash you got me out of the bondage amen of this fleshly body that was born in hybridization death can't hurt me death can only transfer me to where I long to be anyway the life in me continues in the life of God hallelujah there's no more fear in death amen there's no more fear that the de devil can hold over us because we were already dead remember the Antichrist is death death is not a heart attack right death is not when you quit breathing death is not drowning death is not a car that's not death death is the Antichrist who moves you away from the life of God Amen who will separate you from Christ that's death amen life is not enjoying the pleasures of this world life is coming in contact with God remember brother Bram said he was in the hotel one time and those women were drinking and they're going down and that one woman said whoopee this is living brother brandham said that's death and he quoted the scripture she that liveth in pleasure is dead yet while she liveth right a woman thought she had life she was in the midst of death praise God let's look at Ephesians chapter 5 now verse 8 for ye were sometimes Darkness but now are you light in the Lord walk as children of the light you were sometimes Darkness why because your mind was dark to the things of God you were alienated from the life of God because the ignorance that was in you you were Darkness but now are you light why because in him was life and that life was the light of men and in that word was Life Zoey life and that life come to us when we received the word and that life was the light of men we were sometimes Darkness but now are we light in the the Lord let's go to John chapter 5 John chapter 5: 24 John 5 and 24 says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life see that word haath hath already in possession of he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live for as the father have life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself praise be to God you know what I love says I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of God and those that hear the voice of God the dead shall hear the voice of go of the Son of God and they that hear shall live amen oh praise God I was dead the time was coming but now is now in this generation amen there was death there was spiritual death there was religious death but we have heard the voice of the Son of God and they that were dead are alive amen hey praise be to God Amen they that dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live how do you hear you have to have ears toar he and that's the grace of God brother B says in questions and answerers he says that is a beautiful type to show that through the woman through natural birth we all have to die because we're dead to begin with and only through the man Christ Jesus can we live why because he has life in himself amen so now when we receive Christ we receive life amen we were dead we were born dead we come into the world in a hybrid condition our minds darkened to the things of God under spiritual Amnesia alienated from the life of God separated by the ignorance that was in us but then the light of Life comes and quickens the seed to life and we were dead and sin trespasses has he quickened brother R says it this way in thinking man's filter he says notice the word cannot die deny itself when then it's satisfied or it's the it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there what was in that Cene of God eternal life where was it it was in the C Gene of God in your soul when was put there brother BR said before the foundation of the world Amen and the thought of God is the gene of God is the seed of God and the thought is eternal that's eternal life and it's laying in the seed but it's it's in a dead condition the seed is dormant it's not active it's laying there it's waiting to come to life it's got to be quickened by what it must come in contact with the life of God and when it comes in contact with the life of God the life on the inside will Spring forth the life life must connect with life word must connect with word eagle has to come to Eagle Hallelujah to Quicken it to life so where is the eternal life it's in the seed what comes to the seed eternal life amen the life of God where was the word it was in you a thought of God an attribute of God that part of the word was already in you waiting to be expressed but the word was there had to come into expression so it took the word to bring the word into expression am that's how we were dead because our soul was separated from God Amen but when it comes back in contact with God it Springs to life let's go to Romans chapter 6 therefore we are buried with him by baptism un death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died and sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed into sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so now we who are dead in sins and trespasses as he quickened the life now he's telling us that we need to reckon ourselves dead to be alive in Christ now there has to be an we were already dead but he made alive but to be alive we have to make ourselves dead what is death separation so now what do we need to reckon ourselves we are dead to our old life we are dead to the Natural men we are dead to what we were born at we are dead to the world we are dead to the things of the world we have to separate from our old life and consider the old man now dead to be entered into life life we have to separate from the old and reckon ourselves now dead crucified with Christ dead and buried in the waters of baptism and come forth a new creature because I in order to resurrect I have to die and so now I have to separate from my old life and that is a form of death bringing forth life Colossians 3:3 says ye for ye are dead and your life life is hid with Christ and God I thought brother Chad you said if you're hid with Christ you're alive no my soul's alive I'm alive amen but this man I reckon dead amen I'm separating from the flesh to have life this to me is dead my old nature my old life I'm dying to that to have the real life amen amen and the Rapture brother B says then how do we get into this body 1 Corinthians by one Spirit we're all baptized into this body by one Holy Spirit baptism that if you want to put that down it's 1 Corinthians 12:13 and by one Spirit we're all baptized and the spirit is the Life of Christ is that right the Life of Christ and the life of any seed which he was the word seed brings the seed to life you get it if the that life is laying in the seed and the baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's bound to bring that Seed Life where was the life laying in the seed what came to this life life yeah and it quickened me from Death unto life now beat me burn me drag me behind horses you can't kill me right you can take breath out of my body you can take this body and lay it down with no more animation and no more seemingly life in it but you can't kill me because my life is hid in Christ I've already reckoned myself Dead Brother BR said in the rising of the sun he said this real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word why he's an eagle an eagle to an eagle amen what was it that woke up the eagle in the chicken yard it was an eagle that woke up the eagle it took an eagle to wake up an eagle amen what does it do to take up the word it takes the word to wake up the word it takes life to come to life Amen to wake it up the eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word the word predestinated that's in my soul to the word written for the hour what brings you to life the word predestinated amen in the word written for that hour when the word written for that hour comes in contact with the word predestinated it quickens it to life like the eagle to the eagle that's why this message brings a seed for this day it brings it to life amen amen cuz it's not an antichrist death it's Christ the word of God which is life amen this word that's been given in this generation is life this message is life because this message is Christ it's not Antichrist the denominations are Antichrist all the ideas and Creeds of man are Antichrist that's all death but Christ the word of God is life amen and that word of God in this age amen the word written for this age brings the predestinated seed for this age to life and that's real life when our babies are born we hold them in our arms they've come into this world they're they're a living Soul they they've got breath in their bodies and we say you were just born they're alive the sad part is they were born dead yeah right that's the real tragedy of life amen the little children that we hold and we CLE they were born Dead with their mind darkened to the things of God alienated from the life of God but oh we have a hope that by the mercy of God that they can come to life amen because that birth is not real life the new birth is real life that's why they have to have a new birth that's why you must be born again your first birth birthed you into death your new birth birthed you into life amen that's true life amen so what is life connecting with God what is death separation from God brother B says in Jehovah Gyra he says this isn't for unbeliever they never will see it they are dead to begin with they're already dead we were already dead but he quickened us he says but unbelievers receive nothing it's not for them they're dead to begin with they never was even represented there is nothing in them they're dead holes there's not even a predestinated seed on the inside to receive it by oh that's why if we can receive this word we should rejoiced more than anybody else on this Earth rejoices because we weren't a dead hole amen we were we were in deadness we were in the darkness we were dead in sins and trespasses but oh praise God there was life down on the inside amen it was laying there dark and dormant and separated from the life of God but God in his great Mercy amen would send the light our way would send the word would send the life and when those two made contact with one another it quickened us from death unto life amen never to die [Music] God but it's not so with the rest of the world we were we were part of the first death but we will never be part of the second death that's why the Bible talks about a second death yes remember death is separation we were born dead then brought to life and if we were born dead and brought to life we could never be in the second death because we've already received life let's look at Revelation chap 20 together we're going to close with this with this thought Revelations 20 we're coming to the white Throne judgment in this part of the scriptures Revelation 20:4 says and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the w of Jesus for the word of God which had not worshiped the Beast neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years that's the Millennium but the rest of the Dead live not again under the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection then it says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so those are already those who came to life they'll be in the first resurrection they'll Rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years and the second death has no power on them because they've already passed from Death unto life amen and then further down let's let's go continue down a little bit further and this is where we come to the white Throne judgment and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the Earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead that was in them and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire now we come to the white Throne judgment and it says of the white Throne judgment I saw the dead small and great stand before God they were standing before God they're not what we could consider dead dead means laid flat no breathing you know no no they were standing they were animated they were moving but they were dead this was all the dead these are all those who haven't been born again amen they were like we were before the New Birth came amen all the rest of the Dead were standing there before God and now this is the Judgment of the dead and the Sea gave up the dead and everything gave up the dead and the dead are here to judge but praise God some of them will go into the second death some of the Dead will enter into life at the white Throne judgment amen praise be to God hallelujah why because of the works that they did according to what was written in the books and here's what brother BR says about this in the samon church age from the church age book he said the question now arises why are these righteous ones in judgment because we know some are judged righteous in this judging of the Dead why are they dead because they weren't born again they didn't receive the life of God Amen he said there is no other place that they can come up why are they here there's no other place they can come up they couldn't be in the first Resurrection because that's the resurrection of life but for they are but two resurrections and since they could not qualify for the first resurrection they must come up in the second which is a resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify for the first resurrection the bride are not in the Judgment John 5:24 says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life that is the believer is already the recipient of eternal life which he has in his possession now and shall not come into condemnation and brother B says again shall not come into the Judgment it is what it really says but is pasted and then he interjects permanently from Death unto life but notice carefully Jesus must have yet another group in mind who at a certain Resurrection will receive eternal life they will receive it at the resurrection not not having previously received it as a member of the Bride amen he says he goes on down a little further says but it says in John 5:28-29 that all are going to come forth from the grave said that's not the first resurrection because the first resurrection only the seed of God comes out of the Grave so this is the second Resurrection this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in Revelation 20 11 to5 where the dead were brought before the Lord and judged according to their works and all those names were not in the Book of Life were then cast into the Lake of Fire he goes on further down in the sardan church age he said thus the grain of wheat that became a plant for the Harvest is the record of the church and even as not all of the wheat plant is wheat seed is not all of the plant is used in the Harvest so the church all the church is not the bride and neither is it all given eternal life but part of it is gathered into the Garner and part of it is kept that it might enter into eternal life in the second resurrection and part of it which is a count of chaff is burned in the Lake of Fire death is not what we think death is and life is not what we call Life Death is separation from God life is entering into God here we we see a great mystery brother R teaches us in the church age a great mystery about those who are granted life at the white Throne judgment they're not the seed of God they're not like you and I who already have eternal life in the SE genene they're considered dead because we were considered dead but we had something in us that could receive the word and because of that we were born again none of these in the second re Resurrection were born again but some of them are in the Book of Life yes is that right amen some of them are in the Book of Life not part of the Bride but they're there as an aid and a help Amen in working with the word and working for God and working conjunction with the life of God and because they worked to support the life of God and worked with the word of God and worked with the people of God God though they don't previously have life in themselves like the bride did amen they're granted to enter into life now they can come into the realm of God into the realm of eternals and enjoy life what is death separation from God what is life connection with God now these get to enter into life not previously having had it as a member of the Bride oh life is wonderful not this life life when we look around friends this world is falling apart what we've we we could say that we've had a good life we lived in America we've had jobs we've we've had trials we've had difficulties but we could say we've had a good life hey but it's not always going to stay this way it's getting worse and worse and harder and harder but this isn't life amen this is not life this is death all around us we're immersed in death but life is the life of God that's the reality that we hold in our heart we've already entered into life we've already entered into Heavenly places and Inter seated with Christ Jesus we're in life and life is in us what happens in this world is not our life our life is hid in Christ that's life that's why we don't get disappointed with life we get so discouraged and disappointed with life I say God help me to get my eyes off of this realm and think eternally cuz I still get so disappointed in life discouraged I want a good life I want an easy life this life is not life it's a reflection of life it's a type of life but I want to live for the real life we fear death but if you've had life you can't die there's no death to fear remember when brother bam went to the side of his dying wife amen he he had to struggle through the flood to find his way to a hospital she had been transported and moved and and he found her just as she had passed away she walks up to her and she's already she's already dead hope is already gone and he calls her back you know she died for what we call death but brother Brenham calls her back and the first thing she says to him is oh thank you for saving me thank you for bringing me back to life no the first thing she says this why did you call me back oh praise God I love these things Amen to me this is becoming the reality more and more in my life I'm not afraid to die death is a release I'm living here to serve God's purpose not for my own pleasure not to soak up all I can out of this life and have fun and run around to amusement parks that's not why I'm here I am here to serve God's purpose but when I escape this life I enter into a greater life amen the real life what I've longed to enter into all my life this is a dim reflection of life life is beyond this here comes a woman amen and when she died she's leaving back in this Dimension an 8-month-old baby and an baby girl and an 18month old baby boy can you imagine being a mother a mother who's nursing a baby an 8-month old baby amen girl and and 18-month old with a husband that she loves dearly amen and when she dies and she goes on beyond the Mortal realm and her husband calls her back she doesn't say oh thank you you saved me I was dead and you brought me back she said why did you bring me back she tells brother B she says you know that life that Holy Ghost you preach about it's real it's more real than your real lifee and she said I'm going now amen and she wasn't she wasn't sad she wasn't upset she said you know I'm going she goes that Holy Ghost you preached stick with it amen promise me you won't leave it it's more real than you realize amen cuz she was entering in to the word amen she was entering into the promise she was entering into what was preached and it was more glorious than anything she had ever experienced in this life the final thing she says she says Bill she said now look honey said I'm going fast but remember that Wonder ful holy spirit that we received she said it's taking me through she said promise me this honey that you'll never cease you'll never let up you'll always stand true to that then she said she said it's wonderful in death Hallelujah this great Holy Ghost this real life it's wonderful in death when you're passing from this side to the next it's wonderful in death the Holy Ghost is what was carrying her through amen I'm so thankful for a message amen that'll break us out of carnality and stop the depression and stop the disappointment and stop the discouragement because you know what this depression and disappointment discouragement is it's because we don't have the kind of life we want to have we're trying to make a better life and we get discouraged CU I didn't get what I wanted and I don't feel good in this life and my goodness we got to say I'm not here for that purpose that's it's not real life the best that we have here is nothing compared to life in the fifth seal brother Brenham is telling us about going beyond the curtain of time and he goes into the sixth Dimension and he looks back at his body and his body's laying on the bed he's standing on green grass somewhere in the vicinity of his house he's entered into another dimension he's entered into life beyond life amen and he's very much alive he's hugging people talking to them shaking their hands embracing them they're alive they're very real he can handle them and talk to them he can feel the feelings amen he can sense the senses and he looks back at his body laying there and he says huh I must have had a heart attack he's not disappointed he's not upset he's not saying oh I feel feel so sorry that I had a heart attack he just says oh I must have had a heart attack or something and listen the the the thing that's mysterious to me about all of this when he looks back at that what he assumes is a dead body laying on that it's laying next to his wife that he loves so much and he's not saying God send me back let me go back there's something so much more real in this Dimension that he's not begging to go back to an inferior life he's entered into life amen he has dialogue and discussions and then all the sudden he feels a funny feeling and when he feels that feeling he looks back and he sees his body moving on the bed and he says I don't have to go back do I I wonder how his wife felt about this whole experience because when he looked back and he saw his body moving on the bed just next to him was his wife and he says oh good I'm going back to my wife no he says I don't have to go back do I it's far beyond what we've ever imagined friends it's far what life really is is far beyond what we have here by breathing and seeing and hearing and it's far beyond this friends let's let the word of God take us Beyond this Natural Life Death what we call death is nothing it cannot hurt us and it should not scare us what we call life in this life is death yeah it should not bind us it should not disappoint us it should not discourage us it should not depress us because we have real life amen say God please open my eyes God take the isav yeah and rub it in my eyes Lord you know why because I still cry when I get disappointed and I still I I still want a better life I still want more pleasure and more enjoyment in life I mean just being honest I want I want an easy life I want to soak up the best in this life I get disappointed when things don't work out the way I want them when I try something fails I'm disappointed when when I want more and I don't get what I want I feel disappointment I said God put the isav in my eyes and wake me up to the reality of what Hope was saying when she says you know that glorious gospel You Preach it's more glorious than you ever imagined it's the thing that was carrying me through stick with it don't compromise on it don't seee stay with it it's wonderful in death oh it's wonderful in death I said I'll quote it here he says I don't have to go back surely don't let me go tell you what if God allows me to pass beyond the curtain of time please don't call me back Amen brother says in the Easter seal R my redeemer is living now and someday when he comes those bones shall rise again to go to meet him in the air you may bury me in the sea burn it up whatever you want to that quickening power is eternal he says woo I feel Easter right now amen yes sir I've had it for years it's in me it's in you if you the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in your Mor body mortal bodies it's quickened you from the the from the things of the world to the word of God only it's quickened you from this life to life eternal amen you who were once dead in sin and trespasses has now been quickened together to set in heaven places with Christ Jesus feasting on the Mana from above seeing the hand of God made manifested prove the promise of this day oh friends we have life God is life what has been handed to us today the word of God what word the logos not just words on paper not just words that are spoke of a mouth but words that contain the thought of God the perfect interpretation of the word amen the Mysteries revealed the mystery that was in the back of God the back part of God's mind it's in this word so what's come to us in to day the very thoughts of God which is what eternal life the real life the reality has come to us in this day and we have received the life of God by receiving the word of God we have entered into life anything that would SE separate us from that is death any pleasure of this world any relationship in this life is Antichrist anything that we says whoopee this is life if it separates us from this life from this word it's Antichrist it's death death is separation from God separation from the word of God separation from the life of God separation from the spirit of God but what is Life coming back to God because God is life what came to us in this day life what have we received life what is it to reject us death I thank God for life let's all stand together so I hope now we see what true life is yes and what true death is I say I want the life that is life no matter what happens to this body and on my worst day I have life on my best day I have life amen when life disappoints me I live in life amen I have eternal life I thank God for that I want to stop striving to have a life that fails and I want all my striving to go towards a life that will remain I want to live for the Eternal not for the temporal you know that's the challenge of our hour We're Not challenged maybe necessarily with severe persecution we're not challenged with arrest and imprisonment we're not challenged sometimes with the things that previous ages have been challenged with here in America we're not even challenged with poverty and hardship that way you know we're challenged with Easy Living that's our challenge our challenge is a lay to see and condition our challenge is we get everything we want that's our Challenge and can we forsake that to have life you know why the rest of the world wants to come to America because they want a better life CU they think a car and a house and medical coverage and clean clean environment that's a better life that may be a better natural life but this isn't life friends if we want a better life we'll find a better life right here in the word of God that's the better life and those of us who are here in America we're still trying to have a better life and a better life and a better life but my better life is found in the message of the hour and the word of God that's given me a better life and that's real life and that's what I want to put all my effort into and all I say is God help me I'm not yet where I want to be but God help me give me the eyes have to see the reality and strive for thaten God bless you let's bow our heads and pray together Lord Jesus we thank you Father for your goodness to us God your word has Stripped Away all the false realities that are around us God what we thought was real we found out wasn't real what we thought was stable isn't stable God what we've touched and held and the air that we've breathed and the life that we supposedly lived in the flesh none of that was the reality Lord all of this has proved to be a shadow a vapor a Mist that quickly Fades away God I pray that you'd help us to move out from this Shadow from the negative and help us to move into the positive God you sent a message in our day you brought a prophet to come and bring us back in contact with the reality of your word God so that we would know what the truth really is that you've presented to us in this day true life genuine life to save us from true death God I pray that you would save your children God awaken us to a greater reality bring us from more from Darkness into light God all those false ideas and false Notions the fears that still grip us the troubles that we still have in this life I pray God that your illumination of your word would Lift Us above those things to where they wouldn't have such a grip on us Lord but this world will fade into the dimness as the bright light of your reality grows and grows in US we thank you for life you came that we might have life and to have it more abundantly God you come and brought us the reality of life which is yourself God help us to partake of more of that life day by day help us to grow into that light into that life and leave the Dismal World Behind Lord help us to reckon ourselves now dead to reckon ourselves dead dead to the flesh dead to the world dead to what we used to call reality and life help us to be dead to that but alive in Christ Jesus God your word is so good to us God we're so thankful that we are candidates for the first resurrection because it's a resurrection of life and we have received your life you've taken away everything that would frighten us Lord and brought us into the reality we love you for it Lord God I pray if there's any of your seed laying out there with life in them but is dead in trespasses and sin I pray you would go to them Lord you'd bring the illumination of your word over them and Lord would you be a man here that can turn on the lights and flip on the light in their soul and bring illumination and awaken that seed and Quicken it to life that they might understand the reality of Life Lord would you do the work I pray God Lord forgive us for our nearsight inness forgive us Lord for holding on to the rudiments of this world but help us God to break free completely God as soon as hope saw the other side she was ready to let go of everything over here she was ready to let go of relationships let go of Earthly loves the let go of a husband and children things that are the dearest things in our life we can't even comprehend how we could turn loose of them but God as soon as she stepped into a greater reality of life she was willing to give it all up God help us not wait till we die in this life to come into that greater reality but help us Lord to take our hands off of everything and let go of everything in this world and let you lead us and have us and guide us and use us for we're striving for the greater life that our sister already entered into we love you Lord let this become a reality in US day by day we want to give you glory and we want to live for you we want the reality to be in Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen man God bless you brother Ben I live for Jes Jesus and let the world go [Music] by oh
