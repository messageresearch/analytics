[0:00] when the son of man cometh will he
[0:03] find faith
[0:07] that's what the most important what
[0:09] faith now we know
[0:10] is the fate of god
[0:14] and that's what matters because you will
[0:18] see as we reading
[0:19] that everyone had a doctrine
[0:25] and jesus when he came he was not he was
[0:27] not like
[0:28] what is your doctrine are you a
[0:32] what if i say this in
[0:35] it never ask that
[0:38] is the problem is to recognize him
[0:42] recognize when he comes so today
[0:45] let me just say if you recognize him
[0:49] in the formation of his bride
[0:52] and you start manifesting his attribute
[0:56] there will be no fight about doctrines
[1:02] amen there will be no fight
[1:05] because he's going to adjust that fight
[1:08] he's going to adjust that doctrine i
[1:10] mean
[1:11] yeah you will tell me oh no brother when
[1:14] the squeeze
[1:15] comes and then we will have the same
[1:18] doctrine
[1:19] because brethren say that yeah in some
[1:22] way
[1:23] but you can be squeezed only if you
[1:27] are squeezable you gotta
[1:30] be in that fight
[1:34] you gotta be in the body to be squeezed
[1:38] out
[1:40] is that right yeah so therefore
[1:44] i this is the end of the dying world
[1:49] the end of the seals the end of the ages
[1:53] the end of everything a rocket has been
[1:57] blown out and a rocket opened another
[2:01] rocket and another rocket than that
[2:03] and there is the ushering of the
[2:06] millennium
[2:08] where are the doctrines it's the end
[2:12] we used to have we used to have we
[2:15] we used to but we come to the end
[2:19] now we gotta recognize him
[2:22] if you recognize him that he came and he
[2:26] is in the body that i have to manifest
[2:30] him i'm telling you there'll be no
[2:34] doctrines
