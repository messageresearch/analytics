========================================

Amen. But I've had I've heard people say, "Brother Brandon only said that one time and you don't find it in the New Testament." MY GOODNESS. BROTHER BRANDHAM ONLY SAID IT ONE TIME. You don't find in DO WE BELIEVE WE GOT A PROPHET OF GOD OR DO WE NOT HAVE A PROPHET OF GOD? AND IF YOU SAY WE HAVE A PROPHET OF GOD, DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT A PROPHET OF GOD IS? &gt;&gt; Look through the LOOK THROUGH THE BIBLE AND FIND OUT WHAT A PROPHET IS. AMEN. A PROPHET IS NOT A SUPER EXTRA-GIFTED PREACHER. A PROPHET IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. HE BRINGS YOU THE WORD of God. HE HANDLES THE WORD OF GOD. HE IS THE MOUTHPIECE OF GOD. HE IS THE VOICE OF GOD ON EARTH. AND I DON'T CARE IF HE ONLY SAID IT ONE TIME. HE TOOK YOU RIGHT TO THE SCRIPTURES TO BACK UP WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; AND TO REJECT THAT FOR WHATEVER REASONING you want to reject it to me is foolish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I DEALT WITH THIS OVERSEAS BEFORE. I WENT TO A PLACE OVERSEAS AND THEY WERE TELLING ME THIS WAS GOING ON IN THE CHURCH and the church was splitting. Amen. Because there was ministers sitting there who wanted to preach. But they WERE NOT MARRIED TO VIRGINS. AND THEY SAID, "WELL, IT HAPPENED BEFORE WE were converted." Brother Brandham DIDN'T SAY WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER YOU WERE CONVERTED. BROTHER BRENHAM SAID, "IF GOD CALLS A MAN, HE CALLS HIS WIFE, TOO." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WANTED YOU TO PREACH THIS MESSAGE, HE WOULD HAVE PRESERVED YOUR SPOUSE. GOD CAN WORK EVERYTHING OUT. DON'T YOU THINK GOD COULD HAVE WATCHED OVER YOU AND WATCHED OVER HER AND BROUGHT YOU TOGETHER TO PREACH THIS GOSPEL CLEAN AND PURE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU UPHOLD SOMETHING YOU DENY? &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I was dealing with this OVER THERE, AMEN. THE STATEMENT WAS, "BUT I have a gift and the people need it." &gt;&gt; BUT THE GIFTS AND CALLINGS OF GOD ARE WITHOUT REPENTANCE. I YOU SAY, "I HAVE A GIFT." I DON'T DOUBT THAT ONE BIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm not going TO ARGUE WITH YOU. YOU HAVE A GIFT. YOU MAY BE GOOD. MY MY ONE TIME I HAD SOMEBODY IN MY FAMILY, they handed me a cassette TAPE OF A WOMAN PREACHER. SHE SAID, "PLEASE listen to this." This is when we first come to the message and they were trying to persuade me otherwise. I played it. This was after I started preaching. I'd just been called to preach. I was nervous behind the pullpit. I was insecure. I was, you know, all those things. [laughter] I listened to this woman preach and she was marvelous. And I got back to the family said, "What do you think?" I said, "She's good. She's far better than I am, but she's got no right behind the pull pit because the word of God SAYS &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT ABILITY. IT'S NOT ABOUT EFFECT. YOU CAN'T SAY, "WELL, I'VE GOT A GIFT AND THEY NEED ME AND IT'S EFFECTIVE." WHAT DID GOD SAY? &gt;&gt; AS IF GOD CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT YOU AND WITHOUT YOUR GIFT AND GOD NEEDS YOU. LISTEN, GOD CAN RAISE UP STONES. &gt;&gt; He can raise UP CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM OUT OF STONES. DON'T YOU THINK THAT GOD NEEDS you &gt;&gt; because you're a good aator because you have a clear mind and you can put TOGETHER A THOUGHT. YOU MAY HAVE A GIFT, BUT THAT doesn't mean you're called to it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we have nobody ELSE TO DO IT." I'D RATHER GO WITH NOBODY ELSE THAN TO GO CONTRARY TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY DO WE DO THIS? BECAUSE OF REASONINGS. WHAT WAS THE TEMPTATION? THE TEMPTATION WAS NOT TO BE EVIL. THE TEMPTATION, AMEN, WAS TO DO SOMETHING GOOD, BUT NOT ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO PREACH THE MESSAGE. AMEN. AND I'VE GOT A GIFT AND THE PEOPLE NEED ME. THAT'S THE PRIDE OF LIFE, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; I said, God, help us to stick with the word. &gt;&gt; I took two examples, BUT WE CAN APPLY THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE. The thing that brother Brandham taught us about, HE TAUGHT US ABOUT INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. HE TAUGHT US ABOUT ELIGIBILITY to marriage. HE TAUGHT US ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS FOR MINISTRY. HE TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS. AND THE QUESTION IS, IS HE A PROPHET OF GOD? DID HE BRING US BACK TO THIS WORD? IS IT THE WILL AND WORD OF GOD? ARE WE going to reason it away? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we going to go down the line of every other denomination who takes a reason? ARE WE GOING TO STICK WITH THE WORD that's been restored to us? &gt;&gt; I say, God, let's stick with the word.
