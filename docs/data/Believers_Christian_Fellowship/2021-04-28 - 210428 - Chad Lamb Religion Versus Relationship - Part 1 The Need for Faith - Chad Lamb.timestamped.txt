[4:23] god bless you this evening it's good to
[4:25] be here together
[4:26] amen how many just want to please the
[4:28] lord
[4:30] praise god i thank god that he's given
[4:32] us a word
[4:34] and a revelation on that word so that we
[4:35] know how to please him
[4:37] we don't have to come up with our own
[4:39] way or make up our own idea but
[4:41] he has told us the revelation of the
[4:43] word how to please him
[4:44] and how is it we please him by believing
[4:47] his word amen
[4:48] by believing whom he sent let's turn to
[4:51] the book of hebrews chapter 11 when
[4:53] we're standing
[4:54] and read this portion of scripture
[4:55] together
[4:57] i just want to give you an update on
[4:58] brother manuel i was able to text with
[5:00] him just a little bit before service
[5:02] and he said he's still improving and
[5:04] still recovering
[5:05] and he wanted me to give you greetings
[5:07] from him so
[5:09] god bless him as he recovers and makes a
[5:11] full recovery
[5:13] and let's look at hebrews chapter 11 and
[5:16] i'm going to begin reading in verse 1.
[5:20] now faith is the substance of things
[5:22] hoped for the evidence of things not
[5:24] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[5:27] good report
[5:28] through faith we understand that the
[5:30] worlds were framed by the word of god
[5:32] so that the things which are seen were
[5:34] not made of things which do appear
[5:36] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[5:38] excellent sacrifice than cain
[5:41] by which he obtained witness that he was
[5:43] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[5:45] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[5:49] by faith enoch was translated that he
[5:51] should not see death
[5:53] and was not found because god had
[5:54] translated him for before his
[5:56] translation he had this testimony
[5:58] that he pleased god but without faith
[6:01] it is impossible to please him for he
[6:05] that cometh to god
[6:06] must believe that he is and that he is a
[6:08] rewarder
[6:09] of them that diligently seek him
[6:12] let's bow our heads lord jesus we thank
[6:14] you for the privilege lord of coming
[6:16] here
[6:18] lord the privilege of being able to
[6:19] raise our hands and raise our voices to
[6:21] sing your praises
[6:23] i'm glad to hear your word as it's been
[6:25] revealed in this last days
[6:27] god it's a privilege lord many prophets
[6:30] and many godly men have
[6:32] have desired to see this day but lord
[6:34] you've chosen us to be
[6:35] here let it not pass by us lord let it
[6:38] not
[6:39] move over us and let us catch it lord
[6:41] let it not slip through our fingers but
[6:43] may we beware
[6:44] totally aware of what's going on in this
[6:46] day give us a fresh
[6:48] revelation lord i pray that you speak
[6:50] your word through these lips of clay
[6:52] and may you speak the eternal word lord
[6:54] that would forever bring
[6:56] changes to us to lift us higher and
[6:57] higher in the revelation of yourself
[7:00] god we pray you would have preeminence
[7:02] lord among us and that you would speak
[7:04] and that no one else would speak we ask
[7:06] your blessings in jesus christ's name we
[7:09] pray
[7:10] amen you can have your seats
[7:14] i mean i i'd like to take for a subject
[7:17] uh a topic that i i believe i'm going to
[7:19] spend some time on because it's hit me
[7:21] with great impact here recently
[7:23] and that's the subject religion versus
[7:25] relationship
[7:26] so i'm gonna i believe i'm going to be
[7:29] preaching on this maybe for several
[7:30] services
[7:31] i'll be preaching religion versus
[7:33] relationship
[7:35] and and as a subtitle for today
[7:38] i want to talk about the need for faith
[7:40] the need for faith so religion versus
[7:42] relationship
[7:43] the need for faith and i'd like to start
[7:45] off with a disclaimer at the very
[7:47] beginning of this
[7:48] and say when i'm when i use the term
[7:50] religion
[7:51] i know that there's a true religion but
[7:53] i'm referring to man-made religion
[7:56] i'm referring to a religious order in
[7:57] the same way brother branham does many
[7:59] times
[8:00] so so don't be bothered in your mind
[8:02] whenever i use the term religion
[8:04] i'm always i'm i'm through this series
[8:06] i'm looking at the man-made religion
[8:08] man's own religion
[8:09] and his own religious order and his own
[8:11] religious ideas
[8:13] amen so when we look at hebrews chapter
[8:17] 11 here
[8:18] it tells us that by faith abel offered
[8:22] unto god a more excellent sacrifice
[8:24] than cain and we know that brother
[8:26] branham told us faith is a revelation
[8:29] so abel had a revelation so that by
[8:32] faith he offered unto god a more
[8:34] excellent sacrifice
[8:36] than cain by which he obtained witness
[8:38] that he was righteous
[8:40] so now because he had a revelation from
[8:43] god
[8:44] amen in that revelation was his faith
[8:47] in order to act upon the revelation and
[8:49] bring the right sacrifice
[8:51] when he did that it obtained witness
[8:54] that he
[8:55] was righteous amen he did not become
[8:58] righteous he was righteous and because
[9:02] he was righteous he had the capacity to
[9:04] get a revelation from god
[9:06] which was his faith and when he offered
[9:09] the right offering
[9:10] amen it witnessed to him that he was
[9:13] righteous amen
[9:15] praise god so this is really important
[9:20] amen so then we go on down to enoch is
[9:23] it by faith enoch was translated that he
[9:25] should not see death
[9:26] it was not found because god had
[9:27] translated him for before his
[9:29] translation he had this testimony
[9:31] that he pleased god amen how could enoch
[9:34] please god without a revelation
[9:37] i want to ask you how is it how could we
[9:38] please god without a revelation i mean
[9:41] what work before the revelation of the
[9:43] hour came to us
[9:44] what did we do that was pleasing to god
[9:46] amen some of us were in different
[9:48] churches and various forms of belief
[9:50] amen
[9:51] and we we were we were doing whatever we
[9:54] felt like god wanted we chose uh uh
[9:57] we chose the mode of worship they meant
[10:00] according to
[10:00] what we thought was pleasing to god
[10:03] whether we were pentecostal or a
[10:04] catholic or baptist
[10:06] amen some of us were that because we
[10:07] were raised that way and we assumed it
[10:09] was correct and we maintained that
[10:11] some of us had even switched from one to
[10:13] the other amen trying to find the one
[10:15] that would be most pleasing to god
[10:17] but there was no way we could please god
[10:19] until we had a revelation
[10:22] and when we got the revelation we
[10:23] realized that our life was not pleasing
[10:25] to god
[10:26] no matter how religious we were we were
[10:28] not pleasing to god because in our
[10:30] religion we were rejecting his word
[10:32] amen we were taking false titles and
[10:35] baptized and we were
[10:36] we were we were cutting god into three
[10:38] pieces and amen and we were
[10:40] dressing him morally and living
[10:41] immorally amen so there's no way without
[10:44] revelation that we were actually
[10:46] pleasing to god so in order for enoch to
[10:49] have a testimony
[10:51] that he pleased god he had to have a
[10:54] revelation
[10:55] of that word for his day what god was
[10:58] looking for in that day
[10:59] and when he had that revelation and was
[11:01] able because of that faith produced in
[11:03] him in action
[11:04] amen he had a testimony that he pleased
[11:07] god
[11:09] remember this is this is hebrews 11 it's
[11:12] all about faith
[11:14] so the testimony did he please god so
[11:17] you see
[11:18] enoch could have never done enough good
[11:20] works to please god
[11:24] there was other people in that day doing
[11:26] works enoch wasn't the only one
[11:29] trying to serve god through works cain's
[11:33] line was also very religious
[11:34] cain went out from the presence of god
[11:36] but brother bram said he never stopped
[11:38] being religious and cain's children were
[11:40] religious they didn't stop the religious
[11:43] practices
[11:44] just because they went out from the
[11:45] presence of god they maintained the
[11:47] religious practices and they were doing
[11:49] works
[11:50] amen but but enoch was not able to
[11:53] please god
[11:54] by matching them work for work amen he
[11:56] was only able to please god
[11:58] when he caught a revelation of what god
[12:00] was doing in that hour
[12:02] and when he gave himself over to that
[12:04] revelation
[12:05] amen then he could please god but then
[12:10] verse 6
[12:11] but without faith it is impossible
[12:15] to please him no matter how much
[12:18] effort we put into it without faith
[12:21] which is a revelation
[12:22] without faith it is impossible to please
[12:25] him
[12:26] for he that cometh to god must believe
[12:28] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[12:31] them that
[12:31] diligently seek him
[12:35] that phrase we're going to come back to
[12:38] those who diligently seek him
[12:40] let's turn if you would with me to
[12:42] genesis chapter 3
[12:47] i found that as i was looking at this
[12:50] subject it really just
[12:52] exploded for me
[12:55] and i was just seeking where to start
[12:58] because i've got so much
[12:59] more on my heart to say than i can
[13:01] possibly say in one service
[13:03] maybe possibly say in three or four
[13:05] services i don't know
[13:06] just as the lord leads but i thought
[13:08] where do we start
[13:09] and the only place to start is genesis
[13:12] amen
[13:13] you might as well go all the way back to
[13:14] the beginning because brother venom told
[13:16] us
[13:16] everything started in genesis and you
[13:19] know i was discussing
[13:20] with the brother the other day or to
[13:21] even today as everything started in
[13:24] genesis and we've said amen to that for
[13:26] years i believe it brother branham said
[13:28] it i believe everything started in
[13:29] genesis
[13:30] but more and more as he lifts us in
[13:31] revelation i
[13:33] i'm not only agreeing with the prophet
[13:35] said i am seeing with my own very eyes
[13:37] that have been opened by revelation that
[13:39] everything started in
[13:41] genesis everything that we're dealing
[13:43] with today the battle that we're in now
[13:45] amen we can trace it back to genesis
[13:49] so genesis chapter 3 we're going to look
[13:52] at verse 6.
[13:56] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[13:58] good for food and that it was pleasant
[14:00] to the eyes and a tree to be desired
[14:02] to make one wise she took the fruit
[14:04] thereof and did eat and gave also into
[14:06] her husband with her and he did eat
[14:08] and the eyes of them both were open and
[14:10] they knew that they were naked and they
[14:11] sewed fig leaves together
[14:13] and made themselves aprons and they
[14:15] heard the voice of the lord god walking
[14:17] in the garden in the cool of the day
[14:20] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[14:22] from the presence of the lord god
[14:23] amongst the trees of the garden
[14:26] and the lord god called unto adam and
[14:27] said unto him where art thou
[14:29] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[14:31] garden and i was afraid because i was
[14:33] naked
[14:34] and i hid myself and he said who told
[14:37] thee
[14:37] that thou was naked hast thou eaten of
[14:39] the tree where have i commanded thee
[14:41] that thou should
[14:42] not eat. so we know this we know the
[14:45] story really well but i want to begin
[14:47] here
[14:48] and i want to lay a foundation amen that
[14:51] we pray that the lord will build on
[14:53] in the message conference from 1963 he
[14:56] says
[14:56] oh the hour the tremendous time that
[14:59] we're living
[15:00] when men is told of their error instead
[15:02] of trying to come back and say father
[15:04] i'm wrong forgive me
[15:05] they still hide behind fig leaves fig
[15:08] leaves is what they sowed together
[15:10] themselves
[15:11] and they tried the word religion means a
[15:13] covering
[15:14] so i want you to get a hold of that and
[15:16] this is the this is the
[15:18] the this is the reference that i'm using
[15:20] when i discuss religion when i talk
[15:21] about religion versus relationship
[15:24] amen the word religion means a covering
[15:26] and they tried to make themselves a
[15:28] handmade covering
[15:29] and man hasn't changed yet today amen
[15:33] so you don't walk around anywhere and
[15:35] see people amen trying to
[15:37] uh uh make an atonement for themselves
[15:40] by sowing fig leaves together but what
[15:42] they've done is made a man-made religion
[15:44] and in their man-made religion they made
[15:47] their own covering
[15:48] amen and the covering was to cover their
[15:50] sin so when adam and eve fell in the
[15:53] garden of eden
[15:54] they made themselves aprons and aprons
[15:56] was a covering for their sin
[15:58] because the apron was covering the
[16:00] affected area of the sin
[16:03] all right and so this was this was why
[16:06] brother said religion is a covering in
[16:08] the fig leaves was what they made
[16:09] themselves
[16:10] it was a self-made amen covering
[16:13] and the word covering is the same word
[16:15] as the word atonement
[16:17] the word atonement means a covering god
[16:20] made an atonement to cover their sins
[16:22] but adam amen we did not have an
[16:25] atonement he had a religion without an
[16:27] atonement
[16:28] and he made for himself a covering amen
[16:30] but the covering did not possess an
[16:32] atonement
[16:35] it was his covering not god's covering
[16:39] so the word religion means a covering
[16:42] let's look at chapter 3 verse 21
[16:48] unto adam also and to his wife did the
[16:51] lord god make
[16:52] coats of skins and clothed them
[16:55] so this is the first instance we have of
[16:58] of of killing in the bible when god now
[17:01] would kill
[17:02] an animal and we know it's a lamb the
[17:04] prophet told us it's a lamb it's
[17:06] typed all the way through the bible as a
[17:08] lamb but god now would come and he would
[17:10] take
[17:11] an innocent lamb and by the shedding of
[17:14] blood he wouldn't make an atonement
[17:16] or a covering for his children that
[17:18] would fallen
[17:19] and and he would take the skins of that
[17:22] animal whose blood was shed as a
[17:23] substitute for them
[17:25] and now he would cover them so god made
[17:28] a covering
[17:29] god made an atonement and the covering
[17:32] spoke of the atonement
[17:34] so the covering that they were in
[17:36] testified
[17:38] amen that when i'm covered with the life
[17:41] amen of my covering was shed the blood
[17:44] was shed
[17:44] as a substitute offering because now
[17:47] i've polluted blood and i should die
[17:49] i mean but there's a substitute that
[17:51] shed its blood in my place
[17:53] and now the very covering that i'm
[17:55] wearing is testifying
[17:57] of the atonement that god made
[18:00] that is why the bride has to be clothed
[18:03] in the word amen
[18:04] that is why the prophet has to take the
[18:07] clothing of the word
[18:08] amen has to clothe the bride in the word
[18:10] amen because that is
[18:12] that is the word and the word was made
[18:14] flesh and dwelt among us and now
[18:16] the bride is clothed in the word and
[18:17] what if she is clothed then
[18:19] amen is is depicting the blood that was
[18:22] shed the life of the word went out for
[18:24] her
[18:25] as a substitute for her atonement and
[18:27] now the fact that she is clothed in that
[18:30] word
[18:30] is testifying that there was the right
[18:32] atonement that there was shedding of
[18:34] blood
[18:36] amen that's why she must live in the
[18:39] word she must be in christ
[18:40] she must portray the word she must live
[18:42] the life of the word it must be the word
[18:44] upon her amen
[18:45] the word reflected off of her and amen
[18:47] that's her covering now
[18:49] amen it's it's the word amen in the life
[18:52] of the word
[18:53] the word was made flesh amen and the
[18:55] word bled for us the word died for us
[18:58] and that blood amen was the was the
[19:00] price of our atonement
[19:01] and now we're clothed in the word so god
[19:05] was typing it all the way
[19:06] back here and in the message
[19:10] fellowship from 1960 brother said then
[19:13] god made a remedy for that
[19:15] in closing i might say this in the
[19:18] garden of eden when god saw that his
[19:19] children had sinned and had gone from
[19:21] him
[19:22] god himself who is the supreme judge
[19:25] made a reconciliation so he could
[19:27] restore that fellowship
[19:29] to his creatures by the shed blood of an
[19:31] animal
[19:34] and that shed blood lasted for many
[19:36] years speaking of the coming of christ
[19:39] so now what the brother brain was
[19:42] telling us
[19:43] he said god himself
[19:46] who is the supreme judge made a
[19:50] reconciliation so that he could restore
[19:53] that fellowship to his creature by the
[19:55] shedding of blood
[19:57] so when god came he found
[20:01] he found his son and his son's wife he
[20:04] found them
[20:04] fallen now and they had made their own
[20:08] covering
[20:09] tried to cover their sins their own way
[20:11] and by their own religion
[20:14] and god was going to come down and he
[20:17] was going to place
[20:18] judgment upon them now i want you to
[20:21] catch this
[20:23] because there's a lot of things i want
[20:25] to say and i don't know how to say it
[20:27] but just stay tuned in and pull because
[20:29] it's going to take god amen to bring it
[20:31] out
[20:33] because man he was making a covering and
[20:37] what he was trying to do
[20:39] is he was trying to cover his sin
[20:43] and he was trying and cut and covering
[20:45] us and i want you to think of religion
[20:47] religion in our day
[20:48] and covering his sin he was trying to
[20:51] prevent judgment
[20:55] if you just catch this and just stick
[20:57] with me he was trying to
[20:59] cover his nakedness or cover his sin
[21:02] because he wanted to prevent judgment
[21:05] amen
[21:06] but the covering then if there was no
[21:08] judgment
[21:10] then there would be no shedding of blood
[21:12] if there was no shedding of blood there
[21:13] was no proper covering
[21:14] without shedding of blood there was no
[21:16] restoration of fellowship
[21:19] so man in his own covering amen
[21:23] with his own religion now i'm going to
[21:25] say something that's a contrast to what
[21:27] the world believes but
[21:28] it's absolutely the truth and we can see
[21:30] it here in genesis
[21:32] that man's covering was not to bring him
[21:35] into restored fellowship with god but
[21:38] man's covering was to keep him
[21:40] separated from god because man was
[21:43] trying to prevent
[21:44] judgment from taking place but judgment
[21:46] was the very thing that would restore
[21:48] fellowship because
[21:52] god came down as the supreme judge but
[21:55] the supreme judge was a father amen
[21:58] and what the father wanted to do was to
[22:00] judge the sin of his children
[22:02] and in judging the sin of his children
[22:04] he would provide
[22:06] an atonement because he's not just
[22:09] judged he's father also amen
[22:13] if we have a god who's not a father amen
[22:15] then we just have a judge
[22:17] and we want to have a religion to
[22:18] prevent us from coming
[22:20] in contact with that judge because we
[22:22] fear judge
[22:23] unless your judge is also your father
[22:26] and then you're not afraid to come into
[22:28] judgment because it's the father's
[22:30] responsibility
[22:31] after judgment to restore fellowship
[22:35] so the purpose of judgment was restored
[22:38] fellowship amen
[22:40] and the same thing happens with a father
[22:42] today who's raising a little toddler
[22:44] when that toddler begins to become
[22:46] become rebellious and
[22:47] and starts to throw a temper tantrum and
[22:49] they start to fight against mom and dad
[22:51] and they don't want to put their clothes
[22:52] and don't want to eat their food
[22:53] and then they and their actions are
[22:55] breaking fellowship
[22:58] so dad will become the judge and dad
[23:01] will
[23:02] execute the chastisement amen but the
[23:04] chastisement is not just
[23:06] judgment it's judgment with a goal for
[23:09] reconciliation
[23:11] because he's not just a judge he's a
[23:14] father amen
[23:15] so he will judge the error and he will
[23:18] bring
[23:18] the correction amen so that so that he
[23:21] will be
[23:22] able to restore the fellowship
[23:25] so god in the garden of eden amen he
[23:28] would now
[23:29] come down and he would begin to
[23:32] to to know that his children were fallen
[23:35] and as children had made their own
[23:37] covering
[23:38] but when they heard the voice of god
[23:42] walking in the garden in the cool the
[23:44] evening they hid from god
[23:49] because your religion now see
[23:52] their religion or their covering was fig
[23:54] leaves what they had made
[23:56] their religion was it was possible that
[23:59] their religion
[24:01] would satisfy the ideas of one another
[24:07] because they knew where the sin was and
[24:09] they knew what had went wrong adam and
[24:11] eve so
[24:12] they could make for themselves fig
[24:13] leaves a covering
[24:16] and adam could look at his wife and he
[24:17] could say how do i look and she goes
[24:19] i don't see any sin
[24:22] you're covered you understand
[24:27] and eve could say how do i look and he
[24:29] says you're covered i don't see any sin
[24:33] because the physical area that committed
[24:35] the
[24:36] the sin was covered amen so in the eyes
[24:39] of one another
[24:40] intellectually speaking with carnality
[24:43] they could
[24:43] fool one another into believing that
[24:46] their sin was covered
[24:49] but when they heard the voice of god
[24:51] amen
[24:52] and the voice of god amen denotes the
[24:55] presence of god
[24:56] because it says in the scripture that
[24:58] they hid themselves
[25:00] from the presence of god let's read that
[25:04] let's read that
[25:07] chapter 3. let's go back
[25:11] verse 7 and the eyes of them both were
[25:13] open and they knew that they were
[25:15] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[25:17] and made themselves aprons
[25:18] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[25:20] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[25:22] day
[25:22] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[25:24] from the presence of the lord
[25:26] amen the voice and then be spoken of his
[25:30] bespoke of his presence amen and they
[25:32] hid from his presence
[25:34] because under the voice of god when the
[25:37] presence of god comes
[25:38] now there's a realization that although
[25:41] you're covered you're naked
[25:43] [Music]
[25:45] they were hiding from god and they said
[25:48] and they hid themselves from the
[25:50] presence of god amongst the trees of the
[25:52] garden and the lord god called unto adam
[25:53] and said unto him where art thou
[25:55] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[25:56] garden and i was afraid because i was
[25:58] naked
[25:59] and i hid myself amen technically he was
[26:02] not naked
[26:03] technically he had an apron of fig
[26:06] leaves
[26:08] but but his religion crumbled to pieces
[26:11] amen
[26:12] he was still covered in his own religion
[26:15] but when he heard the voice of god
[26:17] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[26:19] evening amen there was the presence of
[26:21] god that had come into the garden
[26:23] and he hid from the presence of god
[26:25] because he knew that he was naked
[26:26] his religion would not allow him to
[26:29] enter into the presence of god
[26:32] so religion listen friends this kind of
[26:35] religion
[26:36] religion has never been intended
[26:40] to bring somebody closer to god
[26:45] religion is actually a barrier
[26:49] to prevent reconciliation and restored
[26:52] fellowship with god
[26:55] now i made my disclaimer you know what
[26:56] i'm talking about there's a true
[26:58] religion but i'm talking about this kind
[26:59] of religion
[27:01] religion is not intended to bring
[27:04] somebody closer to god
[27:06] that is not satan's purpose in religion
[27:13] it is intended to make somebody
[27:16] feel covered
[27:20] and in their covering they're trying to
[27:22] prevent judgment
[27:25] and in the attempt to prevent judgment
[27:28] they have
[27:29] they have separated themselves from
[27:31] reconciliation because reconciliation
[27:33] can only come through judgment
[27:37] praise god that's why when jesus was
[27:41] hanging on the cross that was the
[27:42] judgment of the father
[27:44] that was the judgment of the supreme
[27:46] judge but the judgment of the supreme
[27:48] judge had an intent to reconciliation
[27:52] to restore fellowship with his lost
[27:54] children
[27:57] but they didn't want to come to judgment
[27:59] they wanted to cover their sin
[28:02] but this is the very reason that the
[28:04] jews tried to kill jesus when he came
[28:06] because when jesus came
[28:08] he was the voice of god
[28:11] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[28:13] evening
[28:15] it was the presence of god unrecognized
[28:18] and in their presence they were naked in
[28:20] in that voice in the presence of that
[28:22] voice because he was speaking on behalf
[28:24] of god
[28:25] and reflecting the very life of god and
[28:27] when jesus was speaking
[28:29] what jesus was doing was making them
[28:32] naked because jesus said if i had not
[28:36] come and done the works that no other
[28:37] man did
[28:38] you you would have a covering for your
[28:40] sin but now you have no cloak
[28:44] because now the presence of god had come
[28:46] and declared that the presence of god
[28:48] was here the voice of god
[28:49] was again on earth amen and what did
[28:52] they do they
[28:53] tried to stop the voice because the
[28:55] voice amen was
[28:56] cutting through the fig leaves
[28:59] and they were feeling naked and instead
[29:03] of coming to
[29:04] judgment they stopped the voice
[29:07] so that they could stay covered and stay
[29:09] separated from god
[29:13] so religion is intended
[29:16] to keep man separated from god religion
[29:19] is
[29:19] not to bring man into the presence of
[29:21] god
[29:25] praise god in the message the super sign
[29:29] he says adam
[29:30] he tried to make a super religion
[29:32] without an atonement
[29:34] they're still trying to do it a super
[29:36] religion make a religion so he could
[29:38] live any way he wanted to without an
[29:40] atonement
[29:41] and still have a covering he tried to do
[29:44] it in the beginning and he is still
[29:45] trying to do it
[29:46] but god's provided way was an atonement
[29:48] and it will never work
[29:49] no other way it has to come back to an
[29:52] atonement
[29:54] praise god and god hiding himself in
[29:57] simplicity he says in the beginning
[29:59] when man sinned it showed the nature of
[30:01] man
[30:02] he always trying to hide from god
[30:06] and make himself a way that he can feel
[30:08] justified
[30:09] a religion i understand what we're
[30:12] saying now
[30:13] man's religion is a way for him to hide
[30:16] from the judgment of god
[30:18] and hide himself from the presence of
[30:20] god so that he can feel
[30:22] justified because
[30:25] i went to church and i paid my tithe and
[30:28] and i took the sacraments
[30:30] and and i and i sang the songs and i did
[30:33] everything that i was supposed to do in
[30:34] religion
[30:35] now i feel covered
[30:39] because man is born with a guilty
[30:40] conscience he knows he's wrong and he
[30:42] knows there's a god no matter what he
[30:43] says he knows he's wrong and he knows
[30:44] there's a god
[30:45] that's why religion is so prevalent amen
[30:48] no matter how advanced science get
[30:50] religion remains prevalent
[30:53] no matter how how they they try to
[30:55] disprove god
[30:56] and how they try to prove it's a myth
[30:58] and say but religion remains prevalent
[31:00] because god that
[31:01] man knows that he's guilty and he knows
[31:03] that there's a god
[31:06] and so they make a covering
[31:09] he's always trying to hide from god and
[31:12] make himself a way that he can feel
[31:14] justified a religion so he's trying
[31:18] to cover for his own guilt and trying to
[31:20] cover for his own
[31:21] guilt amen and it's amazing that this
[31:24] religion
[31:25] can become so complicated
[31:30] because man will do anything
[31:34] to stay out of the presence of god
[31:39] he'll take any religious form in any
[31:42] religious order
[31:43] to stay out of the presence of god when
[31:46] god
[31:46] brought his children as a nation his
[31:48] chosen nation elect nation out of egypt
[31:51] and brought him to sinai
[31:52] he wanted to unite with them in marriage
[31:54] and he wanted them to come into his
[31:56] presence
[31:56] but when he came down in thunder and
[31:58] lightning and fire upon the mountain
[32:00] when he spoke they were supposed to come
[32:02] into the mountain but when he spoke
[32:04] they ran away because
[32:07] man amen is afraid to come into the
[32:09] presence of god
[32:10] because when he comes into the presence
[32:11] of god he's laid bare he's naked
[32:14] there's no hiding and he must come to
[32:16] some form of judgment
[32:19] so they could not bear the commandment
[32:21] to come up unto him
[32:22] so they ran away and they told moses you
[32:25] go
[32:26] up and you get all the commandments and
[32:29] all the orders
[32:30] and whatever he says to do will do
[32:32] because they would rather
[32:34] keep an order than have a relationship
[32:37] with that god of fire and lightning
[32:39] and thunder and judgment
[32:42] and the same thing is true today friends
[32:44] they would rather have a religious order
[32:46] no matter how
[32:47] complex it is no matter how many beads
[32:50] you do and how much you kneel
[32:52] how many times you have to follow this
[32:53] order in that order it doesn't matter
[32:55] how complicated you got it
[32:57] man is trying to avoid coming into the
[33:00] presence of that judge
[33:02] because they don't know that that judge
[33:04] is their father
[33:07] he's just the judge and so man will keep
[33:11] creating his religion and evolving his
[33:13] religion
[33:14] making his religion more complex or or
[33:17] more frivolous however he wants to make
[33:18] his religion
[33:19] and what he's trying to do is man is
[33:21] trying to hide from god
[33:23] but find a way that he can feel
[33:25] justified
[33:28] to cover his guilty conscience so he'll
[33:31] come up with all kinds of rituals and
[33:33] acts and
[33:34] services and things that he must do and
[33:36] church attendance and tithe paying
[33:38] and and taking sacraments and taking
[33:41] orders and
[33:42] praying to gods and bring the statues
[33:44] and
[33:45] saints and doing beads and blah blah
[33:48] blah blah blah
[33:50] because he's trying to find a way to
[33:52] feel justified
[33:55] a religion that's been a religion means
[33:57] a covering so he tried to make his own
[33:59] religion we're still in god hiding
[34:00] himself in simplicity
[34:02] but god made his decision on how that he
[34:04] would meet man
[34:05] that was upon the shed blood and that's
[34:06] the only way no matter how much we try
[34:09] any other way
[34:10] that's the only place that god will meet
[34:12] man for fellowship
[34:13] is under the shed blood
[34:16] that's important the only place he'll
[34:19] meet for fellowship
[34:20] is under the atonement
[34:23] let's look at genesis chapter 4.
[34:31] i'm going to look at verse 3.
[34:35] and in process of time it came to pass
[34:37] that cain brought of the fruit of the
[34:38] ground an
[34:39] offering unto the lord and abel he also
[34:41] brought of the first things of his flock
[34:43] of the fat thereof
[34:45] and the lord had respect unto abel into
[34:47] his offering
[34:48] but in decaying and to his offering he
[34:50] had not respect
[34:51] and cain was very roth
[34:55] and his countenance fell
[34:58] i just i can't hardly believe what i'm
[35:00] reading
[35:04] cain brought his offering of the fruit
[35:07] of the ground and offering to the lord
[35:09] and abel also brought
[35:10] the first things of his flock and of the
[35:12] fat thereof and the lord had respect
[35:14] unto abe and his offering
[35:15] but in decaying into his offering he had
[35:17] not respect and cain was very roth he
[35:20] was very frustrated and very angry
[35:24] who was he angry at he was angry at god
[35:28] why because god didn't accept his
[35:31] idea of worship
[35:35] and his countenance fell brother bam
[35:38] says in the message the odd boy said a
[35:40] human
[35:40] has to worship you have to worship
[35:43] something
[35:44] it's just in you to worship so a human
[35:47] has to worship
[35:48] something so we have to understand that
[35:50] this is in humanity
[35:52] amen even the atheist will worship
[35:54] science or or some
[35:56] something but a
[35:58] human has to worship something and in
[36:01] the message spiritual amnesia he says
[36:03] did you know cain offered as good
[36:04] as cain offered as a good sacrifice to
[36:08] he was sincere build an altar knelt down
[36:11] in worship and offered a sacrifice and
[36:13] prayed to god
[36:14] and if god that's all god requires for
[36:16] you to belong to a church and have an
[36:17] altar and pay your tithe
[36:19] and go to church and to live a good life
[36:21] if that's all he requires he was
[36:23] unjust to condemn cain because he did
[36:26] the same thing yes sir that's exactly
[36:28] but religion means a covering and you
[36:31] can't be covered by your own good works
[36:34] there's only one thing that god will
[36:36] accept and that's the blood of jesus
[36:38] christ
[36:40] praise god let's go back here to genesis
[36:42] chapter 4 and pick it up in verse 6
[36:44] and the lord said unto cain why art thou
[36:46] wroth
[36:47] why are you so angry and why is thy
[36:50] countenance fallen
[36:52] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[36:54] accepted
[36:55] and if thou doest not well send life at
[36:58] the door and unto thee shall
[36:59] be his desire and thou shalt rule over
[37:02] him
[37:06] see
[37:10] he came to cain
[37:13] and he accepted one form of worship
[37:16] and he rejected another
[37:20] and cain became angry
[37:23] and so these little these scriptures
[37:25] though they're not
[37:26] they're not many words they're deep rich
[37:29] in meaning
[37:32] why was cain angry amen if he came to
[37:35] god and god with his father
[37:36] amen and he if he had a desire to please
[37:40] god why would he not become curious
[37:44] instead of angry like
[37:47] if his only motivation was to please god
[37:51] with his sacrifice
[37:54] then when god was not pleased with his
[37:56] sacrifice
[37:57] why did he become angry why was he full
[38:00] of wrath amen
[38:01] why was he angry towards god when god
[38:04] didn't accept his sacrifice
[38:06] if he wanted to please god amen and then
[38:09] now god in his mercy he comes to cain
[38:12] and say
[38:13] cain why are you roth and why has that
[38:14] countenance fallen if thou
[38:16] do good amen and brother branham
[38:18] explains this to us
[38:21] he says he tells him if you'll just do
[38:23] like your brother abel
[38:26] and his mercy now now look at the
[38:28] picture
[38:29] cain and abel they both had a desire to
[38:32] worship amen
[38:33] they both wanted to offer worship
[38:35] because it's in man to worship
[38:36] so cain he works out the best form of
[38:39] worship that he can think of
[38:42] because it was not offered by faith it
[38:45] was offered by
[38:46] wisdom by intellectualism
[38:49] so he gave the very best that he had he
[38:51] put his work and he put his effort into
[38:53] it
[38:53] and he worshipped god according to the
[38:55] best of his understanding
[38:57] and the best of his thinking but abel
[38:59] abel did not offer according to his own
[39:01] thinking
[39:02] because abel offered by faith a more
[39:04] excellent sacrifice
[39:05] that means by revelation so abel never
[39:08] offered of his own thinking
[39:10] he offered by a revelation that god gave
[39:13] him
[39:13] of what would be pleasing to the lord
[39:15] and he brought a sacrifice
[39:17] no matter how simple or how ugly or how
[39:20] bloody
[39:20] he brought a sacrifice that was pleasing
[39:23] to the lord
[39:24] not one that was pleasing to himself
[39:27] but cain brought an offering that
[39:29] satisfied his desire
[39:30] and satisfied his understanding abel
[39:33] brought one that he may not have even
[39:35] understood until the revelation clicked
[39:37] amen and then he understood why
[39:39] and he brought it and he pleased god
[39:43] because without faith it is impossible
[39:44] to please god
[39:47] so abel pleased god and god accepted his
[39:50] sacrifice
[39:51] cain pleased himself and god did not
[39:54] accept the sacrifice
[39:55] and then cain became angry and i think
[39:58] if all i wanted to do was please my
[40:00] father
[40:00] and he was pleased with this and not
[40:03] with that why wouldn't you just
[40:04] replicate the same action if the only
[40:07] thing you're interested in doing is
[40:08] pleasing god
[40:10] even when god comes along and gives you
[40:12] the opportunity
[40:13] and says if you'll do good will you not
[40:15] be accepted
[40:17] if you just repeat just watch and repeat
[40:19] amen won't you be accepted
[40:21] but he was so angry amen he would not it
[40:24] didn't it didn't stop his wrath he was
[40:26] still
[40:26] angry because god wouldn't accept it his
[40:29] way
[40:30] and he wanted to worship god his way
[40:32] because he was not
[40:33] interested in pleasing god he was
[40:36] interested in satisfying his own
[40:38] desire to worship
[40:41] we just peeled the mask off all religion
[40:44] in the world
[40:45] amen
[40:51] cain he came
[40:54] god came to him what mercy
[41:00] god came to him and asked him why he's
[41:04] the wrath
[41:05] if you'll do good just just do what able
[41:08] does
[41:09] it'll be fine with you just do it want
[41:11] mercy amen
[41:13] and it just goes to show that cain did
[41:16] not want to please
[41:17] god cain had no faith so he had no
[41:19] capacity to please god
[41:21] but neither did cain have a desire to
[41:23] please god
[41:26] because god made it so simple all you
[41:29] have to do is repeat what you saw
[41:33] and he wouldn't even do it
[41:36] the reason he wouldn't do it is because
[41:39] cain would not come to judgment
[41:43] abel was willing to come to judgment
[41:47] and by faith abel realized i was born
[41:50] wrong
[41:53] i am wrong
[41:58] in abel's revelation brought him to
[42:01] judgment to where now abel
[42:05] needed god
[42:08] and he needed god to accept his
[42:11] sacrifice
[42:12] so that he could have atonement so that
[42:14] he could be brought back into
[42:15] relationship
[42:16] with god abe
[42:20] cain was not interested in having a
[42:22] relationship with god
[42:24] so he was trying to avoid the judgment
[42:26] because he didn't need the atonement
[42:28] because he did not want the relationship
[42:32] but you and i we don't want religion
[42:34] amen we don't want
[42:36] just our own covering we want a
[42:38] relationship with our father
[42:39] and because we want a relationship with
[42:41] our father when the voice of god makes
[42:43] us naked we don't hide we run
[42:45] naked and open amen and say god help me
[42:48] i need you you've got to save me amen
[42:50] you've got to wash me with your blood
[42:52] you've got to cleanse me because i'm
[42:54] wrong
[42:55] by revelation i'm wrong i was born wrong
[42:57] i'll always be wrong
[42:59] unless you judge me unless you come as a
[43:02] father
[43:03] amen and you accept my worship you
[43:05] accept my sacrifice
[43:06] and atone for me through the blood of
[43:08] jesus christ
[43:11] i will forever be lost there's nothing i
[43:14] can do to
[43:15] fix this problem there's nothing i can
[43:17] do to make this right
[43:18] i have to have a blood atonement amen
[43:21] and i have to have a sacrifice that's
[43:23] accepted by you
[43:24] and this is the only one oh god save me
[43:30] first corinthians 11 we read this at
[43:32] communion amen but it says
[43:34] for if we would judge ourselves we
[43:36] should not be judged
[43:38] but when we are judged now i want to
[43:40] look at judgment
[43:41] a judgment coming from a father now
[43:45] if we would judge ourselves we wouldn't
[43:46] mean to be judged that goes the same
[43:48] thing for our children if our children
[43:49] would just judge their own actions
[43:51] there's no reason for dad to be judged
[43:53] if they would just say you know what
[43:54] that's not mine i shouldn't take it i
[43:56] shouldn't take it from my brother
[43:59] that would be wrong for me to do that
[44:00] then no need for dad to judge
[44:03] if they would say you know really it's
[44:05] not right for me to punch my
[44:08] brother or sister but when they fail to
[44:11] judge themselves
[44:13] then there has to be a judge that will
[44:16] bring them back into fellowship
[44:20] and the scripture says but when we are
[44:23] judged
[44:24] we are chastened of the lord that we
[44:26] should not be condemned with the world
[44:28] amen
[44:29] that's a father amen that's when we fail
[44:32] to judge ourselves
[44:33] he will judge us amen to so he we won't
[44:36] be lost with the world
[44:37] he wants us to be his and with him and
[44:40] in fellowship with him
[44:42] so judgment serves a totally different
[44:44] purpose for the children of god
[44:47] in the message three kinds of believers
[44:49] the prophet said just like eve was
[44:50] she was very religious of course but she
[44:53] did not believe the true word and she
[44:55] had to make herself a religion
[44:56] so she made some fig leaves see but it
[44:59] wouldn't work
[45:00] religion means a covering cain did the
[45:03] same thing
[45:04] cain couldn't believe that that was
[45:06] right he said god is holy
[45:07] god is pure god is beautiful so i will
[45:10] get me some flowers and
[45:11] i'll make the flowers and i'll make a
[45:13] fine great altar and i'll show my
[45:14] reverence to him
[45:15] i'll get up before it and i'll bow down
[45:17] before him and worship that god and
[45:19] i'll put flowers on the altar because
[45:21] you know my father and mother eat some
[45:22] apples
[45:23] some fruit in the garden of eden and
[45:25] that's the thing that brought me out and
[45:26] so
[45:27] that's i will go back because i'll make
[45:29] it beautiful
[45:30] god just can't turn my big cathedral
[45:33] down why
[45:34] it'll be too big of a cathedral i'll
[45:35] make it so pretty till it'll track
[45:37] god's attention satan is the one that
[45:40] dwells in beauty
[45:42] that's exactly what the scripture says
[45:44] notice satan dwells in beauty
[45:46] what did he try to do in the beginning
[45:47] make a more beautiful kingdom than
[45:49] michael's was
[45:50] moved over in the north took two-thirds
[45:51] of the angels with him
[45:53] whose son that was then had that nature
[45:56] in him
[45:57] satan's son it was
[46:00] now he built the altar and he knelt down
[46:02] and he worshipped
[46:04] he went through everything that abel did
[46:06] but abel knew
[46:08] that it was blood that took him out he
[46:10] knew
[46:11] that was it it was sex blood so he took
[46:14] a little animal and offered it upon a
[46:15] rock and chopped its neck
[46:17] notice cain god told him said why don't
[46:19] you worship like your brother
[46:21] and you'll do all right you'll do well
[46:23] if you do that but no
[46:24] he know too much about it see
[46:28] he rejected the original a vindicated
[46:30] word
[46:32] if that ain't his children today
[46:35] now look god had testified the bible
[46:38] said the hebrews to chapter 4 chapter 11
[46:41] 11 chapter god testifying of his gift
[46:43] that he was righteous god vindicating
[46:45] his offering
[46:46] god made proof that that was what what
[46:48] he accepted
[46:50] that was his word his plan
[46:54] so when when abel had caught the
[46:56] revelation
[46:57] he had caught the mind of god he had
[46:59] caught the word of god
[47:01] he had caught the plan of god and now
[47:04] abel was working according to the plan
[47:07] of god
[47:08] god's plan of redemption and that was
[47:12] the word for his day
[47:15] that god made proof that that what he
[47:19] accepted that was his word his plan and
[47:21] told cain do the same thing and live
[47:23] but do you think he would he would
[47:25] forfeit his idea
[47:26] no sir let's look at genesis chapter
[47:30] four verse eight
[47:32] and cain talked with abel his brother
[47:35] and they came to pass
[47:37] when they were in the field that cain
[47:38] rose up against abel his brother
[47:41] and slew him now hold your finger right
[47:44] here and go with me to first john
[47:46] chapter 3.
[47:48] first john chapter 3.
[47:53] and pick up one other scripture here
[48:00] first john chapter 3
[48:04] and verse 11.
[48:08] for this is the message that you heard
[48:10] from the beginning that we should love
[48:11] one another
[48:12] not as cain who was of that wicked one
[48:15] and slew his brother
[48:16] and wherefore slew he him because his
[48:19] own works were
[48:20] evil and his brother's righteous
[48:24] marvel not my brethren if the world
[48:26] hates you
[48:30] so cain talked with abram
[48:36] his brother and it came to pass when
[48:37] they were in the field that cain rose up
[48:39] against abel's brother and slew him
[48:42] so it makes you wonder what they talked
[48:43] about
[48:45] because the question was proper worship
[48:49] and abel had a revelation of what the
[48:51] proper worship was
[48:52] and abel's revelation uncovered the fall
[48:57] and the need for an atonement for the
[48:59] shed blood of an innocent one
[49:01] and abel's revelation
[49:04] required a judgment
[49:09] cain did not like what he heard i don't
[49:13] know exactly what was said
[49:15] the bible doesn't tell us you can only
[49:17] imagine
[49:18] whatever the discussion was it made cain
[49:21] desired to kill abel and why did he why
[49:24] did he slay his brother why slew him
[49:27] because his works were evil
[49:30] and his brothers were good we're
[49:32] righteous and so you have to ask
[49:34] yourself
[49:34] what were his evil works was it drinking
[49:37] was it smoking
[49:38] was it womanizing what was cain doing
[49:41] that was so
[49:41] evil amen cain's evil works was
[49:44] trying to make his own atonement
[49:48] avoiding judgment and creating his
[49:51] own religion so that he could justify
[49:53] himself
[49:56] this is why he was so angry when god
[49:58] would not accept
[49:59] his sacrifice because cain felt
[50:02] justified
[50:05] in his sacrifice because when he was
[50:07] wrath he was angry
[50:08] why do you get angry you only get angry
[50:10] when you feel like you've been
[50:12] unfairly treated so cain
[50:15] amen he was self-righteous and he felt
[50:18] like
[50:19] he he had achieved it was good enough
[50:22] amen and god said it's not
[50:24] good amen and then he became angry
[50:27] because he had his own form of
[50:29] righteousness
[50:33] but abel just waited on the lord and
[50:36] found out what god wanted
[50:37] and when he caught the revelation for
[50:39] his day
[50:41] he acted upon that revelation and god
[50:44] testified
[50:44] that is that he was righteous testifying
[50:47] by his works that he was righteous amen
[50:49] he was righteous because he was able to
[50:52] receive the revelation for the word of
[50:54] that day
[50:55] and he could believe it and he could act
[50:57] upon him
[50:58] but cain's works were evil in his evil
[51:01] works
[51:02] amen it says why slew he his brother
[51:05] because his works were evil so it wasn't
[51:08] the slaying of his brother that was his
[51:09] evil works he had evil works before he
[51:11] slew his brother
[51:15] and what did cain do that was so evil i
[51:18] mean
[51:18] he worked really hard to give a
[51:20] sacrifice to god he planted he tilled
[51:23] he weeded he protected he built an altar
[51:26] he brought flowers he brought fruits he
[51:28] gave a beautiful offering his works
[51:31] his works if you put the works the labor
[51:33] the effort
[51:34] of cain against the labor and effort of
[51:37] abel
[51:38] cain's works far outweighed the works of
[51:41] abel
[51:42] his effort and the beauty and all that
[51:44] he put into his sacrifice
[51:46] far outweighed that of abel but in god's
[51:49] scale
[51:50] when he saw faith amen when he saw faith
[51:52] in the word for the hour
[51:54] god saw it this way amen
[51:58] and cain felt justified in his own
[52:02] actions and when god would not accept it
[52:05] instead of humbling himself and being
[52:07] judged
[52:08] he became angry with god and when god
[52:11] told him just to do like abel does he
[52:13] goes and he has a conversation with
[52:14] abel and after he has that conversation
[52:16] with abel he decided to
[52:18] kill abel and why did he kill abel
[52:20] because when there was a voice of god
[52:24] cable abel had the revelation he had the
[52:27] word
[52:28] he had the path back to god amen he knew
[52:30] what the atonement was
[52:33] he knew what needed to be judged he knew
[52:35] how to come to the judgment
[52:37] and when he had the revelation he was
[52:39] the voice of god to cain
[52:42] amen and cain could not endure that
[52:44] voice amen and he wanted to
[52:46] hide from the voice and the only way to
[52:48] hide from the voice
[52:49] was to stop the voice amen and to kill
[52:51] his brother because his own works were
[52:53] evil
[52:56] and that's why john says marvel not when
[52:59] the world hates you amen
[53:01] because you're testifying amen there's a
[53:04] path back to god
[53:05] and all these other paths are wrong amen
[53:08] they're a man's own doing
[53:09] man's own achievement man's own covering
[53:12] he is
[53:12] there's no atonement in it amen there's
[53:15] no covering but you have to come to the
[53:17] judgment to recognize
[53:19] what went wrong in the garden what's
[53:21] wrong with religion what was wrong with
[53:22] the church ages why we need a judgment
[53:26] today
[53:28] when you begin to become that voice of
[53:30] revelation
[53:31] amen now the voice is in you amen the
[53:34] voice of god is in the bride
[53:35] and it's the voice of god walking in the
[53:38] garden of his bride
[53:40] in the cool of the evening amen and it's
[53:42] testify
[53:43] your very life amen your very confession
[53:46] what
[53:47] by revelation you understand is
[53:49] testifying
[53:50] that the works of religion are evil
[53:55] what's evil feeding the poor feeding the
[53:57] poor is not evil
[53:59] going to church amen giving tithe
[54:02] supporting missionaries
[54:03] printing bibles it means what's evil
[54:06] is rejecting the judgment and the true
[54:08] atonement amen and not coming through
[54:10] the judgment in this hour
[54:12] to have your father make an atonement
[54:14] for you then feeling
[54:16] self-justified by your own works and
[54:18] your own covering
[54:20] those works are evil
[54:23] because those works
[54:26] do not bring you into the presence of
[54:30] god
[54:32] but that religious order keeps you
[54:35] from the presence of god because the
[54:39] presence of god
[54:40] would expose the religious order as
[54:43] false
[54:48] and so there's no denomination
[54:51] no religion that is out there
[54:55] bringing people to god
[54:58] they it's all inspired by cain
[55:02] who's of the wicked one and it is all in
[55:05] an effort to
[55:06] keep people from the presence of god
[55:11] you may think what i'm saying is extreme
[55:13] but it's the truth
[55:16] it is the truth
[55:21] because if it was bringing them to the
[55:23] presence of god
[55:24] it would destroy the very system that's
[55:26] supposed to be bringing them to the
[55:27] presence of god
[55:30] and no man is not going to allow his
[55:32] system to be destroyed
[55:34] so he'll protect his system and
[55:37] protecting his system
[55:39] he'll kill the voice when jesus came in
[55:42] jerusalem they were in the system
[55:45] they were part of the system they were
[55:47] entrenched in the system and in order to
[55:49] protect the system
[55:50] which gave them a false covering
[55:54] they would not come to a true atonement
[55:56] for their day
[55:57] they had a false covering amen but jesus
[56:00] was there
[56:01] he was the voice of god walking in the
[56:03] in the garden in the cool of the evening
[56:05] and he was there amen to bring them the
[56:07] voice of god
[56:08] and instead of running to god their
[56:10] religion had them running away from god
[56:13] and hiding from the presence of god
[56:15] until they could not resist that voice
[56:17] and they could not hide
[56:18] and when they heard that voice and they
[56:20] knew the presence of the lord was there
[56:22] they realized they were naked and
[56:24] instead of repentance
[56:28] they desired murder
[56:32] and when cain realized he was naked
[56:36] he desired murder over repentance
[56:43] praise god
[56:48] and the message now actually i want to i
[56:51] want to read another passage of
[56:52] scripture
[56:54] let's go back to genesis chapter 4. pick
[56:56] it up at verse 9.
[57:00] oh praise god
[57:07] the seals have been open the cover has
[57:11] been taken off
[57:14] this bride is not going to fall into the
[57:16] same trap
[57:17] [Music]
[57:19] because the seals have been open these
[57:21] things have been exposed
[57:26] chapter 4 verse 9 and the lord said unto
[57:29] cain where is abel thy brother
[57:31] and he said i know not am i my brother's
[57:33] keeper look at the rebellion in the face
[57:36] of god there is zero repentance
[57:37] zero remorse
[57:42] and the lord said unto cain where's the
[57:43] able thy brother and he said i
[57:45] i know not am i my brother's keeper and
[57:47] he said what hast thou
[57:48] done the voice of thy brother's blood
[57:50] crieth unto me from the ground
[57:52] and now art thou cursed from the earth
[57:54] which has opened her mouth to receive
[57:56] thy brother's blood from thy hand
[57:58] when thou tilted the ground and shall
[57:59] not henceforth yield unto thee
[58:01] her strength a fugitive and a vagabond
[58:03] shall thou be in the earth
[58:05] and cain said unto the lord my
[58:07] punishment is greater than i can bear
[58:10] and now god finally comes with the
[58:12] judgment he refused god's judgment he
[58:14] refused god's way
[58:15] he even refused god's voice in the
[58:17] living vessel in that day
[58:20] and so now there's no recompense but god
[58:22] to bring judgment and god's judgment is
[58:24] righteous
[58:25] and cain is still disputing with god
[58:28] that god is not fair
[58:33] my my my look at the pride and arrogancy
[58:36] of cain with cain's worship and his
[58:37] religion
[58:38] he could in in cain's religious desire
[58:42] in cain's worship no matter how
[58:43] beautiful and religious and pious it was
[58:46] that that spirit within him that would
[58:49] make him worship
[58:50] in such a beautiful pious sacrificial
[58:53] way
[58:53] is the same spirit that will reject the
[58:56] word of god
[58:56] and call what is good evil
[59:00] and say it's not right and it's not fair
[59:03] like somebody in the denomination
[59:04] it's not fair that god has an elect who
[59:06] are you telling that it's not fair
[59:09] are you telling god it's not fair that
[59:11] he made a choice
[59:13] and that he chose it he made his
[59:14] election before the foundation of the
[59:16] world
[59:16] what do you mean the same spirit lives
[59:18] today amen when they come into the face
[59:20] of judgment amen and god begins to break
[59:23] down the word and say god has an elect
[59:25] in this day and he come for his elect
[59:27] he say that's not fair it's not fair
[59:29] that god would choose some
[59:30] come it's the same spirit that lives
[59:34] today
[59:38] it's a religious spirit
[59:43] he says now cain said unto the lord
[59:46] verse 13 my punishment is greater than i
[59:47] can bear
[59:48] behold thou has driven me out this day
[59:50] from the face of the earth and from thy
[59:52] face shall i be hid
[59:54] and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
[59:56] in the earth and it shall come to pass
[59:57] that everyone that findeth me shall slay
[59:59] me
[1:00:01] now listen i just want to stop here for
[1:00:04] a second
[1:00:06] he is being sent out from the face of
[1:00:08] the earth in the face of god
[1:00:10] and he is not remorseful that he
[1:00:14] is going to be out of the presence of
[1:00:15] god from the face of god
[1:00:18] he is sad that somebody's going to kill
[1:00:20] him
[1:00:23] i tell you if i had to live without the
[1:00:26] presence of god i'd rather somebody
[1:00:28] kill me he was going to move into hell
[1:00:31] because there's no god in hell hell is
[1:00:34] uh opposite devoid
[1:00:35] of the face of god of the presence of
[1:00:37] god and he was going to move into his
[1:00:39] hell
[1:00:39] amen and he wanted to live there
[1:00:43] he wanted to preserve his life
[1:00:46] separate from the presence of god
[1:00:52] cain was not interested in pleasing god
[1:00:54] one drop amen
[1:00:55] he was not interested in a relationship
[1:00:57] with god all cain wanted to do was play
[1:00:59] please himself promote himself preserve
[1:01:02] himself
[1:01:06] and now he's sad because somebody's
[1:01:08] going to kill him everyone that finds me
[1:01:10] shall slay me
[1:01:12] and the lord said unto him therefore
[1:01:14] whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall
[1:01:16] be taken on him sevenfold
[1:01:17] and the lord set a mark upon cain lest
[1:01:19] any find him
[1:01:20] should kill him this is the first mark
[1:01:23] of the beast
[1:01:26] and cain went out from the presence of
[1:01:28] the lord
[1:01:30] and dwelt in the land of nod on the east
[1:01:32] of eden
[1:01:34] and came to his wife and she conceived
[1:01:37] and bear enoch and he builded a city and
[1:01:40] called the name of the city after the
[1:01:41] name of his son
[1:01:43] enoch oh there's so much there but we're
[1:01:46] gonna
[1:01:47] get into that later but he goes out and
[1:01:50] his whole desire
[1:01:51] was to preserve himself to promote
[1:01:54] himself
[1:01:55] so he goes out from the presence of the
[1:01:56] lord and he's fearful that somebody will
[1:01:58] slay him
[1:01:58] because he wants to perpetuate his life
[1:02:01] devoid of god
[1:02:05] and god puts a mark on him that nobody
[1:02:07] should kill him and he goes out and he
[1:02:08] takes a wife
[1:02:09] and he goes out and he has a son and he
[1:02:11] builds a city because
[1:02:13] cain is satisfied with a life outside
[1:02:16] the presence of god
[1:02:20] oh praise god
[1:02:24] brother said in the message take on the
[1:02:26] whole arm of god he said but hurry up
[1:02:27] these intellectual giants are too much
[1:02:29] for god's humble people
[1:02:31] god's people has always been uneducated
[1:02:33] and humble just tell me one time it was
[1:02:34] any other way
[1:02:35] watch the two sons watch cain and cess
[1:02:38] children abel was killed
[1:02:40] which was a type of death burial
[1:02:41] resurrection of christ
[1:02:43] seth took his place now cain's children
[1:02:45] become intellectual religious
[1:02:47] because their father was intellectual
[1:02:49] cain religious
[1:02:51] and cain built an altar able built an
[1:02:53] altar
[1:02:54] so you see now i want you to catch they
[1:02:57] they have gone
[1:02:58] out from the presence of god
[1:03:02] they are separate from the presence of
[1:03:04] god
[1:03:06] separated from the face of god which
[1:03:07] brings us presence
[1:03:10] but they are still just as religious
[1:03:16] the form of worship didn't change the
[1:03:19] bringing of a sacrifice
[1:03:21] the making of an altar the bringing of
[1:03:24] first fruits to
[1:03:26] you realize it didn't change
[1:03:29] they continued to be religious and they
[1:03:32] continued to worship
[1:03:33] because in the original cain desired to
[1:03:36] worship and he wanted to worship
[1:03:40] but i want to ask you a question was
[1:03:43] cain worshipping god
[1:03:45] or was cain worshipping himself
[1:03:50] who was cain pleasing with his worship
[1:03:54] they go out and they continue to worship
[1:03:57] just as like before
[1:03:58] they were intellectual they were
[1:03:59] religious is what he said
[1:04:03] he said it came build an altar abel
[1:04:04] built an altar cain made an offering
[1:04:06] abel made an offering cain worshipped
[1:04:08] abel worshipped
[1:04:09] and if god only respects a church its
[1:04:11] order its worship its offerings and so
[1:04:12] forth
[1:04:13] if that's all god respects he was unjust
[1:04:16] for condemning
[1:04:17] cain because he was just as religious as
[1:04:19] abel was but he didn't come the right
[1:04:21] way
[1:04:22] how about moab there was israel there
[1:04:24] was moab who worshiped the same god we
[1:04:26] do what was it it was lot's daughter's
[1:04:28] child and there they was they went out
[1:04:30] and brought bishop
[1:04:31] balaam in and he made seven altars just
[1:04:33] like they was down in israel
[1:04:35] now israel was an undenominational had
[1:04:37] no nation to go to
[1:04:38] but it was going to one amen here we
[1:04:41] have no continuing a city but we're
[1:04:43] seeking one to come
[1:04:44] watch balaam offered seven clean
[1:04:46] sacrifices bulldogs just like they had
[1:04:48] down in israel
[1:04:49] and balaam offered seven rams speaking
[1:04:51] of the coming of christ
[1:04:53] so did israel now there's a mirror image
[1:04:56] of worship taking place
[1:04:57] in moab under a prophet balaam and in
[1:05:00] israel under a prophet moses
[1:05:02] there's a mere reflection of worship in
[1:05:04] the sacrifices of seven rams
[1:05:08] but one is right and one is wrong
[1:05:13] praise god then if fundamentalism is all
[1:05:16] that god requires both places was
[1:05:18] justified
[1:05:20] but what was it what was it that balaam
[1:05:22] failed to see
[1:05:23] he failed to see that pillar of fire he
[1:05:25] failed to see the smitten rock that
[1:05:27] brass servant going before israel for an
[1:05:29] atonement
[1:05:31] israel had an atonement with their
[1:05:32] worship
[1:05:34] he failed to hear the shout out of the
[1:05:36] camp the king among them he
[1:05:38] judged him by their works god don't
[1:05:40] judge no one by their works
[1:05:43] judge you he judge you by your faith
[1:05:47] notice i want to clear that up about the
[1:05:49] little woman last night too it wasn't
[1:05:50] her works of washing his feet
[1:05:52] he justified her then before simon by
[1:05:55] saying
[1:05:55] what she had done he justified her by
[1:05:57] her works what she was doing
[1:05:59] but when he justified her in her own
[1:06:01] side he said thy faith have saved thee
[1:06:04] because no man is justified by works by
[1:06:06] her faith
[1:06:07] in him being the son of god not what she
[1:06:09] was doing but her faith in him
[1:06:11] and your faith always tells your works
[1:06:13] that's right
[1:06:16] i want to go back to genesis chapter 4.
[1:06:18] let's go all the way down to verse 25.
[1:06:23] and adam knew his wife again and she
[1:06:25] bear a son
[1:06:26] and called his name seth for god said
[1:06:29] she hath appointed me another seed
[1:06:30] instead of abel whom cain slew
[1:06:33] and to seth to him also was born a son
[1:06:36] and he called his name
[1:06:37] enos then began men to call upon the
[1:06:41] name of the lord
[1:06:43] i want to contrast this with cain when
[1:06:45] cain went out of the presence of the
[1:06:47] lord
[1:06:47] he took a wife he had a son he named his
[1:06:50] son enoch
[1:06:50] and then he built a city
[1:06:54] and he named the city after her son
[1:06:56] enoch seth goes out and takes a wife
[1:06:58] and has a son and a son named enos and
[1:07:01] after he has a son
[1:07:02] then began men to call upon the name of
[1:07:04] the lord
[1:07:06] so you have two lines here you have a
[1:07:09] the false
[1:07:09] vine and you have the righteous vine and
[1:07:11] these two vines begin
[1:07:13] all the way back here and genesis both
[1:07:15] of them
[1:07:16] worship both of them sacrifice
[1:07:20] both of them build altars both of them
[1:07:22] have religious ceremonies do you
[1:07:24] understand what i'm saying
[1:07:26] but cain amen was was perpetuating his
[1:07:29] own life
[1:07:30] in his own desire because he no longer
[1:07:33] was in the presence of god
[1:07:34] he was separated from the presence of
[1:07:36] god but he was satisfied to continue
[1:07:39] worship without the presence of god
[1:07:45] but seth now wasn't going to build a
[1:07:48] city
[1:07:50] he wasn't interested in
[1:07:51] self-preservation he wasn't interested
[1:07:53] in making a name for himself
[1:07:55] he wasn't interested in establishing
[1:07:57] himself because
[1:07:58] seth had one interest amen when his son
[1:08:00] was born
[1:08:01] this line had one interest and that
[1:08:03] interest was to call upon the name of
[1:08:05] the lord
[1:08:06] they wanted a relationship with god
[1:08:10] amen cain did not want a relationship
[1:08:12] with god
[1:08:13] cain wanted to perpetuate his own life
[1:08:16] and make his own name and establish
[1:08:17] himself
[1:08:18] as a mighty man upon the earth but seth
[1:08:21] in his lineage were calling what were
[1:08:23] they calling upon the name of the lord
[1:08:25] they were seeking his face they were
[1:08:27] looking for his presence
[1:08:28] they were trying to get back into
[1:08:30] fellowship with god
[1:08:31] amen they wanted to be in fellowship
[1:08:34] with god
[1:08:35] cain could care less if he was in
[1:08:36] fellowship with god because in order for
[1:08:38] him to come to fellowship with god
[1:08:40] he would have to get rid of all his own
[1:08:41] ideas and be judged
[1:08:50] so then began men to call upon the name
[1:08:53] of the lord
[1:08:55] proverbs 18 10 says the name of the lord
[1:08:57] is a strong tower
[1:08:59] the righteous runs into it and is safe
[1:09:03] and god's only provided places of
[1:09:05] worship he says and the name
[1:09:06] is in the word because he is the word
[1:09:10] i want to ask is there a righteous line
[1:09:12] here that's not interested in their own
[1:09:13] form of worship or they're
[1:09:15] perpetuating their own life upon the
[1:09:16] earth is there a line here that's not
[1:09:18] satisfied
[1:09:19] living a life void and separated from
[1:09:21] the presence of god
[1:09:22] but is there a line a righteous line a
[1:09:25] vine that's still on the earth today
[1:09:27] that's looking amen
[1:09:29] seeking after the name of the lord
[1:09:32] well he said his name is in the word
[1:09:37] because he is the word what is he then
[1:09:41] the word interpreted is the
[1:09:44] manifestation
[1:09:45] of the name of god if there's a line
[1:09:48] here amen that is calling on the name of
[1:09:51] the lord
[1:09:51] then they have to come to the word
[1:09:53] interpreted because the word interpreted
[1:09:56] in this day
[1:09:56] is the manifestation of that name that
[1:09:58] you're looking for
[1:10:00] because that name speaks of his presence
[1:10:03] it speaks of a person with a presence
[1:10:05] and that personal presence can come
[1:10:09] it's seeking restored fellowship it's
[1:10:11] seeking
[1:10:12] not just the name so that i can say the
[1:10:14] name jesus christ billions can say the
[1:10:16] name jesus christ
[1:10:18] but i'm looking for the person of that
[1:10:20] name i'm looking for the presence of
[1:10:22] that person
[1:10:22] here and where will i find that name
[1:10:25] that name is in the word
[1:10:26] and the word interpreted is a
[1:10:28] manifestation of that
[1:10:30] name and if i'm calling on the name of
[1:10:32] the lord
[1:10:33] i better find where the word is
[1:10:35] interpreted
[1:10:38] no wonder flesh and blood has not
[1:10:39] revealed this to you but my father which
[1:10:41] is in heaven has revealed this to you
[1:10:43] who i am and upon this rock i'll build
[1:10:47] my place of worship and the gates of
[1:10:48] hell can't shake it down
[1:10:49] amen a living church of god standing
[1:10:52] firm
[1:10:53] and firm foundation on jesus christ
[1:10:55] alone you can sing the song
[1:10:57] but if you're not on christ the word
[1:11:00] you're on teetering faltering sand
[1:11:02] but upon this rock christ my word
[1:11:07] and the message the conflict between god
[1:11:08] and satan to satan had
[1:11:10] has his system of work again to get
[1:11:14] people to misbelieve the word of god
[1:11:17] satan's wrong way of worship
[1:11:21] like cain and like balaam they're very
[1:11:24] religious
[1:11:26] cain was religious he brought an altar
[1:11:28] made an altar frankly
[1:11:29] cain was more religious than abel
[1:11:34] that should make you feel good because
[1:11:36] you'll never out do a real sincere
[1:11:38] catholic
[1:11:40] in one of these third world countries
[1:11:42] who really do it all
[1:11:43] right cain was more religious than abel
[1:11:46] sure was
[1:11:47] he done more for the lord than abel did
[1:11:49] but abel came
[1:11:50] in the way of the word that's
[1:11:54] all he done more he built a great
[1:11:57] denomination he built a great thing a
[1:11:59] great christian heritage
[1:12:00] but you see he come in the wrong way
[1:12:05] it wasn't received now wrong for it was
[1:12:08] contrary
[1:12:09] to the word balaam was just as religious
[1:12:12] as moses he came with the same sacrifice
[1:12:14] the same lambs the same clean animals
[1:12:16] everything
[1:12:17] and prayed to the same god and offered
[1:12:19] sacrifice to the same god that moses did
[1:12:21] though he came in the wrong way see it
[1:12:23] was contrary to the word
[1:12:25] like it was in eden
[1:12:29] then when we get to the message the
[1:12:31] indictment he says that's the only place
[1:12:33] he meets with man today
[1:12:35] is under the shed blood of the sacrifice
[1:12:39] i don't care if you're methodist baptist
[1:12:41] presbyterian
[1:12:42] if you can forget your differences roman
[1:12:44] catholic whatever you might be
[1:12:45] and will come under the shed blood god
[1:12:47] will meet with both of us
[1:12:48] there
[1:12:52] that's where we can all meet and
[1:12:53] fellowship on the same grounds but
[1:12:55] otherwise he will not meet just because
[1:12:57] you're a methodist
[1:12:58] he will not meet just because you're a
[1:12:59] pentecostal he will meet with you under
[1:13:01] one condition that's under the shed
[1:13:03] blood when your sins
[1:13:04] has been confessed and expelled in his
[1:13:06] presence then by the blood and the blood
[1:13:08] is always before him
[1:13:10] and therefore he only can see you
[1:13:11] through that shed blood
[1:13:13] and your white as snow see when you
[1:13:14] confess your sins otherwise you're not
[1:13:16] there you cannot fellowship
[1:13:18] that's the reason that you don't see
[1:13:20] things happening in the churches
[1:13:22] they confess that they believe the blood
[1:13:25] they reject the very plan
[1:13:27] to get to the blood the word
[1:13:30] think about this brother i'm saying you
[1:13:32] have to come whether your method is
[1:13:34] catholic
[1:13:34] presbyterian pentecost it doesn't matter
[1:13:36] you've got to come under the shed blood
[1:13:38] of the lamb the shed blood of the
[1:13:40] sacrifice to have fellowship again
[1:13:42] amen but he says they confess that they
[1:13:45] believe the blood
[1:13:47] but they reject the very plan to get to
[1:13:50] the blood
[1:13:51] which is the word so how do you get to
[1:13:54] the blood
[1:13:55] through the word and the word is his
[1:13:58] name
[1:13:59] amen is the manifest the word
[1:14:00] interpreted is the manifestation of his
[1:14:02] name
[1:14:05] let's go to revelation 19. i want to
[1:14:07] read one more scripture
[1:14:15] revelation 19
[1:14:23] and 11 revelation 19 11 and i saw heaven
[1:14:26] opened
[1:14:27] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:14:29] upon him was called faithful and true
[1:14:31] and in righteousness he does judge and
[1:14:33] make war his eyes was a flame of fire
[1:14:35] and on his head were many crowns
[1:14:37] and he had a name written that no man
[1:14:39] knew but he himself and he was clothed
[1:14:41] with a vesture dipped in blood
[1:14:42] and his name is called the word of god
[1:14:47] if you're seeking his name his name is
[1:14:51] in his word
[1:14:53] because when the word came when the word
[1:14:56] was restored
[1:14:58] our bridegroom came the revealed word
[1:15:02] his presence is here his name is here in
[1:15:05] the revealed word
[1:15:07] and under that revealed word is also the
[1:15:11] atonement
[1:15:13] the shed blood in the message the
[1:15:16] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:15:18] he says what is sin
[1:15:19] sin is unbelief unbelief in what the
[1:15:22] word
[1:15:22] unbelief in god which is the word
[1:15:26] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving
[1:15:29] soon for the skies amen standing ready
[1:15:31] think your garments washed by the water
[1:15:34] of the bleeding
[1:15:35] word we've come
[1:15:38] to the atonement how have we come to the
[1:15:41] atonement
[1:15:42] because we waited for revelation of who
[1:15:44] he is in this hour
[1:15:46] by the revelation of god we see him as
[1:15:49] he is in this day
[1:15:50] and he is the word that has been
[1:15:51] restored and that word has come and
[1:15:54] judged
[1:15:54] every other system false
[1:15:58] and when the when the word came the life
[1:16:00] was here amen
[1:16:02] the blood life was here the life that
[1:16:04] was in the blood and now we're
[1:16:06] washed listen friends we're washed
[1:16:08] there's an atonement being made when we
[1:16:11] come in the right form of worship
[1:16:12] when we come by revelation amen to be
[1:16:16] judged so that we can be restored in
[1:16:18] fellowship with god
[1:16:19] when we only desire to please him we
[1:16:21] come by the word and then when we desire
[1:16:23] to be restored in fellowship we come by
[1:16:25] the word
[1:16:26] when we desire to seek his name we come
[1:16:28] by the word when we seek his face we
[1:16:30] come by the word because he is the word
[1:16:33] it was the word that was made flesh it
[1:16:35] was the word that bled it was the word
[1:16:36] that died amen and now we're washed in
[1:16:39] the bleeding
[1:16:40] word
[1:16:43] washed by the water of the bleeding word
[1:16:44] the word became blood the word bled for
[1:16:46] you
[1:16:46] and you are washed in bleeding word the
[1:16:50] word bleeding the life of god in the
[1:16:51] word and the word was bled for you
[1:16:53] that you might be washed from the filth
[1:16:55] of these prostitutes
[1:16:56] and be cleansed and sanctified by the
[1:16:58] washing of water
[1:17:00] of the word and makes your mind and
[1:17:02] heart stayed on god
[1:17:04] and on his word and he anoint the ones
[1:17:08] at the end time he says
[1:17:09] where the carcass is the eagles will
[1:17:12] gather eagles
[1:17:13] the fresh kill of the word
[1:17:17] the word that's raised up in fat and
[1:17:19] been made manifest
[1:17:20] and give out to the food for the
[1:17:23] children
[1:17:26] i want to end with this quote brahm said
[1:17:32] in the message the god of this evil age
[1:17:35] said notice what he will do his thoughts
[1:17:37] he thought god dwelled in worldly beauty
[1:17:40] he did that in heaven
[1:17:42] sin never began in the garden of eden it
[1:17:43] began in heaven when lucifer the son of
[1:17:45] the morning exalted himself in beauty
[1:17:47] and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than
[1:17:49] that of michael and he thought that god
[1:17:51] dwelt in beauty
[1:17:52] and noticed cain he he didn't want no
[1:17:55] blood sacrifice he come down and offered
[1:17:57] the fruit
[1:17:58] or the fields of beauty upon his altar
[1:18:00] very religious done everything
[1:18:02] just exactly like abel done offered a
[1:18:04] sacrifice fell down before god in
[1:18:05] worship
[1:18:06] obedient in every way but without the
[1:18:08] revelation of the word
[1:18:11] and the word was from the beginning
[1:18:13] god's plan
[1:18:15] god's plan of what god's plan of
[1:18:17] redemption god's plan to restore
[1:18:19] fellowship
[1:18:20] the word was god's plan from the
[1:18:21] beginning and today
[1:18:24] god's plan is his word
[1:18:27] and the way to seek his name the way to
[1:18:29] find him
[1:18:30] is in the word amen and the way to be
[1:18:33] atoned for
[1:18:34] is to come by the way of the revealed
[1:18:36] word and be washed in the bleeding word
[1:18:39] the fresh kill today the fountain that
[1:18:41] is flowing today
[1:18:43] the atonement that is today amen friends
[1:18:45] everybody's thinking they're getting
[1:18:46] people to the blood but they've rejected
[1:18:48] the path to the blood
[1:18:50] and they rejected the word how are they
[1:18:52] getting people to the fresh
[1:18:53] kill today how are they getting them to
[1:18:55] the bleeding word the fountain that's
[1:18:57] open and bleeding today
[1:18:58] when you very reject the word and by
[1:19:00] religion
[1:19:01] move people away in fear from the word
[1:19:06] the religious order of the day in
[1:19:09] religion the spirit of religion
[1:19:11] is to keep man from god and to keep from
[1:19:14] restoring the relationship but god sent
[1:19:16] a prophet in this day
[1:19:18] amen to judge the entire system
[1:19:21] to judge the religious order the judge
[1:19:24] what came from
[1:19:25] cain has been perpetuated through the
[1:19:27] whole earth and now has taken over the
[1:19:29] whole earth
[1:19:30] god came to judge that by opening his
[1:19:32] word by opening the seals
[1:19:34] and revealed the whole thing
[1:19:38] and what did they do when they heard the
[1:19:40] voice say man did they run
[1:19:41] to it and fall in repentance and find a
[1:19:43] fresh atonement for this day
[1:19:46] no they shut the doors to it they pushed
[1:19:49] it out they rejected it amen they killed
[1:19:51] the voice by killing the influence of
[1:19:53] the messenger
[1:19:56] so that they could have their religion
[1:19:58] and the religion would
[1:19:59] keep them from coming to god's judgment
[1:20:02] and if they don't come to god's judgment
[1:20:04] they don't come to restore fellowship so
[1:20:06] the religion was there to prevent
[1:20:08] fellowship with god
[1:20:11] telling people this is the way to god
[1:20:17] but there's a voice in his bride today
[1:20:20] that's saying there's a fresh atonement
[1:20:24] there's a bleeding word there's a place
[1:20:27] to come
[1:20:27] and worship that has an atonement
[1:20:31] not dead forms of religion not old
[1:20:34] orders pointing back to another day
[1:20:36] but there's a path to get to the blood
[1:20:38] today and the path to the blood today
[1:20:41] is the revealed word of the hour
[1:20:46] every other way has shut their doors to
[1:20:49] him
[1:20:50] but there is a way and that way is
[1:20:53] through the word
[1:20:56] the word was from the beginning god's
[1:20:57] plan but god revealed
[1:21:00] by revelation the very thing that he
[1:21:02] vindicated and punctuated that was right
[1:21:05] not religion not an altar not belonging
[1:21:08] to church
[1:21:09] not making a sacrifice not being sincere
[1:21:13] but by the revelation of the word of god
[1:21:18] abel by faith revelation
[1:21:22] offered a more excellent sacrifice and
[1:21:25] by it he was declared righteous
[1:21:30] not a religion not an altar
[1:21:34] not belonging to church not making a
[1:21:37] sacrifice
[1:21:38] not being sincere but by the revelation
[1:21:43] of the word of god brings you into god's
[1:21:46] plan
[1:21:47] and in god's plan there is a sacrifice
[1:21:51] there is an atonement there is a
[1:21:54] restoration of fellowship
[1:21:56] with the father
[1:21:59] the question is
[1:22:02] is seth's line here
[1:22:06] is the vine that come from seth is it
[1:22:08] here
[1:22:10] those that are calling on the name of
[1:22:12] the lord
[1:22:14] not a religion not a sacrifice not even
[1:22:17] a sincerity
[1:22:19] but by revelation of the word of god
[1:22:22] there's a way back
[1:22:24] there's a restoration through the blood
[1:22:27] there's an atonement that'll bring us
[1:22:29] back into fellowship with god
[1:22:31] because the whole purpose was to bring
[1:22:34] us back in fellowship with god
[1:22:37] what the devil has been fighting from
[1:22:39] cain's time all the way down through
[1:22:42] he's been fighting a restoration back to
[1:22:45] fellowship with god
[1:22:46] and how does he fight the restoration of
[1:22:48] fellowship back to god
[1:22:50] he fights it with religion
[1:22:54] he doesn't fight it with the bar and the
[1:22:56] prostitute
[1:22:59] he fights the restoration of the
[1:23:01] children of god the attributes of god
[1:23:02] back to restoration with their father he
[1:23:04] fights it with
[1:23:06] religion
[1:23:09] it's time to shake off the religion
[1:23:12] and come back to the relationship and
[1:23:16] let's all stand
[1:23:17] musicians if you could come
[1:23:23] listen without faith it's impossible to
[1:23:25] please god
[1:23:27] faith and want faith in something that
[1:23:29] was done ages and ages and ages ago
[1:23:31] are faith in the god who's present today
[1:23:35] i say it's faith in the god who's
[1:23:37] present today and the word that's
[1:23:39] revealed today
[1:23:40] without that revelation it's impossible
[1:23:43] to please god
[1:23:44] all of our works and all of our efforts
[1:23:46] will not please him
[1:23:47] he can only be pleased when by faith
[1:23:51] we come to him
[1:23:54] praise god
[1:23:58] i tell you friends the voice of god
[1:24:01] today does the same thing it's always
[1:24:02] done
[1:24:05] it makes you naked
[1:24:08] if you're stuck in religion you could be
[1:24:11] stuck in religion in this church don't
[1:24:13] put it
[1:24:14] don't put it off on a pentecostal you
[1:24:16] could be stuck in a religious order by
[1:24:18] dressing right and believing god sent a
[1:24:20] prophet you could be in religion right
[1:24:22] here tonight
[1:24:24] but you know what the voice of god does
[1:24:26] it makes your religion
[1:24:28] nakedness and when our religion becomes
[1:24:32] nakedness amen that's a good thing not a
[1:24:35] bad things friends and don't
[1:24:36] don't look at that as a bad thing but
[1:24:38] when there's a minister at the pulpit
[1:24:39] that will start to strip away
[1:24:41] amen feeling safe because i grew up in
[1:24:43] the message feeling safe because i
[1:24:44] believe
[1:24:45] god sent a prophet i'm only safe when
[1:24:47] i've come through the revealed word
[1:24:49] and i've come to the fresh blood the
[1:24:51] bleeding word and i can only come by
[1:24:53] revelation in this hour
[1:24:55] and when i've been united back to god
[1:24:57] that's my only place of security
[1:24:59] it's not in coming to the right church
[1:25:01] sitting under the right ministry
[1:25:02] paying tithes keeping the orders not
[1:25:04] cutting hair wearing dresses
[1:25:06] you can do all of that you can sit in
[1:25:07] this pew every day of your life and be
[1:25:09] lost as lost can be
[1:25:11] but there's only one path back and
[1:25:13] that's by revelation of the word
[1:25:16] now revelation of the word will bring us
[1:25:19] amen into that bleeding bloody word
[1:25:21] amen the fresh blood for today that'll
[1:25:24] wash away our sins
[1:25:27] everything else will fail all the
[1:25:31] efforts will fail
[1:25:32] and all the making it to church every
[1:25:34] time the doors are open and always
[1:25:35] paying my tithe and confessing that god
[1:25:37] sent a prophet
[1:25:38] without the revelation of the word that
[1:25:40] restores you
[1:25:42] into fellowship through judgment you're
[1:25:44] lost
[1:25:48] there's no there's no grandchildren
[1:25:52] our great-grandchildren there's only
[1:25:56] children who just
[1:26:00] want to get back in fellowship
[1:26:03] with god
[1:26:06] there's just there's no more orders and
[1:26:09] there's no more religion and
[1:26:10] there's no more correct churches and
[1:26:12] correct this and
[1:26:14] there's only one thing there's got to be
[1:26:17] a people on the earth
[1:26:18] that are calling on the name of the lord
[1:26:21] there's got to be a people that are
[1:26:22] seeking
[1:26:23] if it strips me naked if it takes my fig
[1:26:26] leaves and punches holes through them
[1:26:27] and i have to stand naked in the
[1:26:29] presence of god amen he's got a clothing
[1:26:31] that he can clothe me with amen
[1:26:33] there is a covering for my sin there is
[1:26:36] a blood that will wash me white as snow
[1:26:38] and there's a wedding garment of the
[1:26:40] word that he can place upon me
[1:26:43] to cover my shame but i've got to come
[1:26:46] god's provided way and that's by
[1:26:49] personal
[1:26:50] individual revelation of who jesus
[1:26:53] christ
[1:26:53] is and he is the word
[1:26:57] and he is the word made manifest today
[1:27:01] it's the only place of security friends
[1:27:05] religion is here to prevent you
[1:27:09] from getting close to god
[1:27:13] but god's voice is bidding you come
[1:27:17] forget your fig leaf forget your church
[1:27:20] orders
[1:27:21] forget you're always doing it right and
[1:27:24] just come to the voice
[1:27:26] and let the voice cleanse you and let
[1:27:29] the revelation
[1:27:31] wash you white as snow let the word
[1:27:33] purify you
[1:27:34] and then let the word clothe you and
[1:27:37] then let the word present you to your
[1:27:38] mate
[1:27:39] and then be united to him forevermore
[1:27:43] that is salvation today

[1:27:52] you father for your word
