[0:00] oh i tell you friends the the hardest
[0:03] person in the world to overcome is
[0:05] ourselves the one that we look at in the
[0:06] mirror and if we're ever going to
[0:08] overcome cells we have to start being
[0:10] really honest with ourselves we got to
[0:12] get down to nitty gritty and say you
[0:14] know what that's just me because that's
[0:16] what i want to do i'm trying to make it
[0:18] work out for me i'm interpreting all the
[0:21] little signs you know i want to go do
[0:23] this thing and and i've got a little bit
[0:25] of a check in my heart a little bit of
[0:27] conviction about wasting that money or
[0:29] wasting that time or doing this so i'm
[0:31] going to watch for god to give a sign
[0:33] all of a sudden somebody else said that
[0:35] and look at this it connects with this
[0:37] and i walked through the store and i saw
[0:38] in the newspaper that same word
[0:44] it sounds ridiculous but that's exactly
[0:46] what we do
[0:49] it's exactly what we do
[0:52] instead of just saying god
[0:54] this is what i want
[0:56] but i don't know that it's what you want
[1:00] i need a real answer
[1:04] it's amazing how dishonest we are with
[1:07] ourselves
[1:11] but the the funny part is
[1:13] deep down we know
[1:17] but up here we convince ourselves
[1:20] when down here we're not sold
[1:24] or maybe i'm the only one who does that
[1:28] but i can explain it thoroughly to you
[1:30] because i've been through it numerous
[1:32] times
[1:35] down here there's a little check
[1:38] a little no
[1:40] but up here in the reasoning realm
[1:43] i want to
[1:45] it's not sin
[1:49] right
[1:50] you can't say it's sin
[1:52] i want to do this but down here there's
[1:54] a little no but i will reason and reason
[1:57] and then all if i can find where the
[1:59] prophet did it
[2:02] where
[2:03] see he went fishing
[2:05] i can abandon these duties and go
[2:07] fishing
[2:09] if i can find where the prophet did it
[2:11] or i can find some some some something
[2:15] to give me just that little edge that
[2:18] little push in my reasoning mind amen to
[2:21] get over this nagging feeling i'll go
[2:23] down that path and then think that i've
[2:25] got an answer from the lord but deep
[2:27] down in your heart you already know
[2:32] i don't know how we can go on being the
[2:33] bride of jesus christ unless we start
[2:35] being really real
[2:37] really real all the way down to the core
[2:39] of our persons and stop playing games in
[2:41] our mind and stop playing games with the
[2:43] word and stop playing games with
[2:44] ourselves but get down to the
[2:46] nitty-gritty and say this is here i am
[2:48] lord this is what i've done god forgive
[2:51] me
[2:53] and lead me and let me stay in your word
[2:55] because he'll try to give you a word
[2:57] that will allow you to do what you
[2:59] already want to do
[3:02] and you know what god will let him
[3:05] to prove what's in our hearts
[3:08] and every once in a while we need to
[3:10] fall and bump our nose real hard to
[3:12] realize that i still need god and i
[3:14] still need to be honest with god
[3:17] and i'm still in fallen flesh and i'm
[3:19] still in a corruptable body with a
[3:20] corruptable mind and i need to feed the
[3:24] white dog and i need to stay close to
[3:26] christ and i need to line to this word
[3:28] if i ever hope to overcome in this world
