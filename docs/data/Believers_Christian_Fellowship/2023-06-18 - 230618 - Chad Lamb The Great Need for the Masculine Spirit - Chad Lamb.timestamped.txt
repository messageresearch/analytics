[15:48] thank you for that Lord and Lord we ask
[15:51] that you would take control of the

[15:57] and we come to the preaching of the word
[15:58] we do so all that we've done we've done
[16:01] at your word according to your
[16:03] commandment what you've instructed us in

[16:10] you'll meet us in this way and speak to
[16:12] us you'll Feed Us by your hand and

[16:20] your control and give us all ears to
[16:22] hear and a heart to perceive all that
[16:24] you have for us this day
[16:26] and God may you take the preeminence
[16:28] that we give to you may you instruct
[16:30] your children we love you father and we
[16:33] ask your blessing over the preaching of
[16:34] the word in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[16:37] amen
[16:39] and God bless you we're going to ask you
[16:40] to take a seat just for a moment
[16:43] let's start off by saying Happy Father's
[16:45] Day God bless all the fathers that are
[16:48] here and
[16:49] amen we appreciate you and the
[16:51] sacrifices you make and and the
[16:53] leadership that you give and uh I'm so
[16:56] thankful that we have a Heavenly Father
[16:58] amen
[16:59] who takes responsibility for us and
[17:01] Leadership for us and is set an example
[17:03] for us Earthly fathers to look after to
[17:07] take as our example amen I want to start
[17:09] off with an announcement we had a
[17:11] surprise Joseph and Rebecca Benjamin had
[17:15] their baby already come about a month
[17:17] early I think we've got a picture that
[17:18] we can pull up here
[17:22] yeah Jonathan Jason Benjamin he was born
[17:25] Friday about a month early so praise God
[17:28] they're excited he's doing well he was
[17:30] born just a little bit early and they
[17:31] had to check him out make sure his lungs
[17:33] are developed but he's doing good so
[17:35] just be praying that they all can go
[17:36] home soon and uh pray that we can get
[17:39] they can get down here so we can see
[17:40] this little guy here soon so that was
[17:42] quite a good surprise amen
[17:44] [Music]
[17:48] thank you
[17:49] so we thank God for that amen Lord has
[17:52] certainly been good and gracious and his
[17:54] gifts are wonderful amen I also want to
[17:57] say thank you to the trustees they were
[17:59] out here yesterday had a little bit of a
[18:00] work day with the trustees and a few of
[18:02] the young men and you'll see we have no
[18:04] front road sign because well you may not
[18:06] have noticed if you didn't notice I'm
[18:07] letting you know now they tore it out in
[18:09] preparation to set the new one and that
[18:11] should be done here in a couple weeks
[18:13] we're going to pour some concrete coming
[18:14] up this week and they also all along
[18:16] this front edge they cleaned up that
[18:18] flower bed and redid it and I just want
[18:20] to give a big thanks to the trustees and
[18:22] those that helped them
[18:25] and then
[18:27] they're always doing something amen and
[18:30] sometimes it's notice and sometimes it's
[18:32] unnoticed but they're always working
[18:33] they're always taking care of things and
[18:35] I really appreciate that it means a lot
[18:36] and they're always looking out for the
[18:38] best interest of all of us so we're
[18:40] thankful for that God bless you let's
[18:43] stand
[18:44] together and go to the Book of Genesis
[18:48] chapter one
[18:50] then there's a scripture that I read so
[18:52] often sometimes I get embarrassed I'm
[18:53] going to read it again at the beginning
[18:55] of service but sometimes you just can't
[18:57] help it I don't know so I just ask you
[18:59] to bear with me amen we probably we
[19:02] probably should just put down our Bibles
[19:03] and try to quote it by heart we probably
[19:05] could do it but but let's just start
[19:07] here in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26.
[19:11] and God said let us make man in our
[19:14] image after our likeness and let them
[19:16] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[19:18] and over the fowl of the air and over
[19:20] the cattle and over all the Earth give
[19:22] me all the Earth and over every creeping
[19:24] thing that creepeth upon the Earth so
[19:26] God created man in his own image in the
[19:28] image of God created he him male and
[19:31] female created he them and God bless you
[19:34] as you take your seeds
[19:38] praise the Lord this morning I'd like to
[19:40] preach on the subject the great need for
[19:43] the masculine spirit
[19:45] the great need for the masculine spirit
[19:51] brother bam says in the message marriage
[19:54] of the Lamb he says do you ever read in
[19:56] the scripture how the first man God made
[19:58] was a dual person
[20:00] Adam was both Adam and Eve spiritually
[20:02] speaking but when he made the first man
[20:04] in his own image and God is a spirit but
[20:06] when he put them in flesh he separated
[20:08] them he'd taken the masculine spirit and
[20:10] put into man and taken the feminist
[20:12] spirit and put it into a woman
[20:14] so we realized that man was made in
[20:16] God's Own image and he was made male and
[20:18] female amen so there's a masculine and a
[20:21] feminist part all of that was together
[20:23] and Adam when Adam was made in God's
[20:25] image we know originally in spirit form
[20:27] then in flesh form then from the
[20:29] singular flesh form amen he he split a
[20:33] rim took a rib off of Adam split the
[20:36] spirit between maskin and feminist put
[20:38] it in the woman and put them back
[20:39] together as one
[20:41] and so that was God's handiwork that was
[20:43] God's Great Masterpiece and so we see
[20:46] now when God split the masculine from
[20:48] the feminist Spirit now he made a
[20:50] division and he and he made the
[20:52] masculine one way in the feminist
[20:54] another way and he didn't he didn't have
[20:57] them together any longer he had them
[20:59] separated and one was in what they call
[21:01] a woman and the others was called man
[21:03] and now in order to put these together
[21:05] you must unite the two together in
[21:07] marriage as one
[21:09] amen is that right so God made a
[21:13] distinction and a separation and he
[21:15] separated and whenever God does
[21:17] something that's the way he wants it
[21:19] so God's divided out the masculine and
[21:22] the feminist and he wants it separated
[21:24] he doesn't want it together in one
[21:25] vessel anymore so the only way to have
[21:28] masculine and feminist is to bring them
[21:29] together in holy Union
[21:32] you can no longer mix them together in
[21:35] one vessel any mixing in one vessel is
[21:37] now perversion because God separated it
[21:41] amen
[21:42] so now we see the whole fallacy of the
[21:45] homosexual movement and all these things
[21:46] is because it is contrary to the very
[21:50] nature of God and the Very work that God
[21:52] did and what he wants and how he wants
[21:55] to display himself in this day
[21:58] amen a month ago at Mother's Day we
[22:02] preached on the feminine attribute
[22:05] and the Great Value in the feminine
[22:07] attribute and now we want to look at the
[22:08] other sign the great need for the
[22:10] masculine spirit because really when
[22:12] when it comes down to it you cannot you
[22:15] cannot have one without the other and
[22:17] stay correct in your vision and
[22:18] understanding of God
[22:20] we cannot have just a feminine attribute
[22:23] and allow that to to be everything but
[22:25] then we have an unbalanced view of God
[22:27] Amen neither can we go to the masculine
[22:29] side and ignore the feminine side we
[22:31] once again will have an unbalanced view
[22:33] but these two things must be working and
[22:36] and and and Unison together to display
[22:39] the actual picture that God wants us to
[22:41] see in this day to display the very
[22:43] nature of God it must come together with
[22:45] masculine and feminist
[22:47] amen and so brother Ram says here uh
[22:51] when Adam looked Lonesome so he took a
[22:53] rib from his side and made Eve a
[22:54] byproduct for him he'd taken the
[22:56] feminist Spirit out of Adam and put it
[22:58] in the woman he the love Spirit feminist
[23:00] kind gentle and he left the masculine
[23:03] spear in Adam now if there's anything
[23:04] different there's a perversion somewhere
[23:07] and and then they too was one
[23:10] so now how did God put him back together
[23:12] he put him back together through
[23:13] marriage
[23:15] that's the only way God puts them back
[23:17] together
[23:18] all right
[23:20] we understand
[23:21] God sets principles down and when we
[23:24] stick with those principles they work
[23:25] they bring Health they bring security
[23:27] amen they bring the image of God they
[23:29] bring the word of God the minute we
[23:31] start mixing these things and get off of
[23:34] what God designed we bring death amen we
[23:36] bring destruction we bring insecurity we
[23:39] bring all kinds of problems
[23:41] amen uh I'm just going to read a few
[23:44] quotes here together where brother bam
[23:45] starts talking about the male and the
[23:47] female the masculine feminist is to see
[23:49] some of the the descriptions that he put
[23:52] first of all we'll go to this quote and
[23:54] Satan's in he said God made a man of man
[23:56] he made a woman a woman and he dressed
[23:58] him different and he meant for them to
[24:00] stay that way and to act that way one is
[24:03] finished the other is masculine and he
[24:05] separated Adam in the Garden of Eden and
[24:07] did this separated Eve from him and God
[24:09] wants him to stay that way
[24:11] that's God's desire you go to
[24:13] Deuteronomy 22 this is a scripture that
[24:16] he just referred to there but I'd like
[24:18] to read it together Deuteronomy 22
[24:27] and verse 5 Deuteronomy 22 and verse 5.
[24:35] in Deuteronomy 22 5 he says the woman
[24:37] shall not wear that which pertaineth
[24:39] unto a man neither shall a man put on a
[24:41] woman's garment for all that do so are
[24:43] Abomination unto the Lord thy God
[24:47] God wanted not just a separation in
[24:50] vessels but he wanted a clear
[24:52] distinction even in the way they were
[24:54] dressed
[24:56] that's why it's wrong for a woman to
[24:58] wear pants it's wrong for a man to wear
[25:00] a dress
[25:01] and it used to be that used to be
[25:03] intuitive
[25:04] everybody used to understand that you
[25:06] used to say and even now we live in a
[25:08] conservative area in the United States
[25:09] and in most circles you say it's wrong
[25:12] for a man to wear a dress and most
[25:13] people are like yeah obviously
[25:15] but then you say it's wrong for a woman
[25:16] to wear a pants no no that's fine no if
[25:19] it's wrong for what why is it wrong for
[25:20] one and not for the other but the world
[25:22] has become so perverted you say it's
[25:24] wrong for men to wear a dress and
[25:26] somebody will say well what's wrong with
[25:27] that
[25:29] we've gotten so far away from the image
[25:32] of God Amen and you say how did this
[25:36] happen how did we get to this place it's
[25:37] because the feminist movement and the
[25:39] feminist agenda has neutered the
[25:42] masculine Spirit as neutered men and
[25:44] when you neuter men and you quiet men
[25:45] and you move it all to the feminine
[25:47] attribute amen now all of a sudden
[25:49] you've got chaos breaking out everywhere
[25:51] because what you've done is devalued the
[25:54] masculine spirit
[25:58] that masculine spirit is there for
[26:00] protection
[26:01] for authority
[26:03] and it's needful
[26:05] but as soon as we go and and as soon as
[26:08] we begin to to make men feel guilty for
[26:11] being authoritative
[26:13] then we're wrong
[26:16] make men feel guilty for being leaders
[26:18] we're wrong
[26:20] because that's what God's called them to
[26:22] do
[26:24] brother man says in the message Shalom
[26:26] he says no more than see the young man
[26:29] out there find big fine-built fella with
[26:31] his hair what he curl it up like a woman
[26:33] and do and leotards on and big long
[26:36] sweater hanging down and purple shoes on
[26:39] masculine oh my what a horrible thing to
[26:42] call a man what a thing to call a man
[26:44] that's right
[26:45] see some woman supposed to be daintish
[26:48] lovely come out with a pair of men's
[26:50] trousers on a cigarette in her mouth and
[26:52] bobbed hair what a thing to call a woman
[26:55] remember he's laying it straight because
[26:57] the culture he was in the beatnik
[27:00] movement was moving in and that's how
[27:01] they were dressing with these like tight
[27:03] pants leggings and these long sweaters
[27:05] and the bangs hanging in their face amen
[27:08] and all that that came through the 60s
[27:09] through the Beatles and that whole
[27:11] beatnik movement and brother Branham is
[27:13] man enough to say it's wrong
[27:16] and I'm glad he did
[27:18] I'm not I'm not offended that he said
[27:21] that's wrong why because it's mixing and
[27:23] blending what God didn't want mixed amen
[27:25] he wanted separate vessel for masculine
[27:28] a separate vessel for feminine want them
[27:30] to express masculine and feminine and
[27:32] the only time they're to come together
[27:33] is through marriage
[27:37] not mixed in one vessel again
[27:41] again in the message Shalom he says
[27:42] there seems to be something among men
[27:44] don't seem to be have that masculine
[27:47] touch that he used to have women don't
[27:49] have that feminist touch she used to
[27:51] have you take man today man don't seem
[27:53] to be Burly like they used to be it's
[27:55] all some sort of they want to wear suede
[27:57] shoes with purple and they want to act
[28:00] like women now that is true it seems to
[28:02] be more or less like a perversion a
[28:05] woman wants to cut off her hair and act
[28:06] like a man and a man wants to act like a
[28:09] woman and yet you can talk to them and
[28:11] they're nice people to talk to nice
[28:13] people friendly sociable people what
[28:15] caused this it's that gross Darkness
[28:18] upon the people it's something that's
[28:20] pressed them into it so brother man once
[28:24] again he starts saying a man that wants
[28:27] to wear suede shoes with purple and you
[28:29] begin to say well I can wear any shoes I
[28:32] want and be a man this is what the
[28:33] prophet of God's telling us
[28:35] because you realize amen there's been a
[28:38] feminization of the world and certainly
[28:41] of our culture in America
[28:43] and the fashion has followed suits
[28:47] amen where they make men look feminine
[28:51] where they make men I mean they do these
[28:54] silly things with they slim down their
[28:56] pants so their little pencil legs and
[28:58] then they take and now they cut the
[29:00] shirts different from in than they used
[29:01] to cut them and now they cut them down
[29:03] tight to where it looks like they have a
[29:05] waist and then they they lay their pants
[29:07] low on their hips and and they're
[29:09] actually changing the way men's clothes
[29:11] are even made and making them look
[29:12] feminine
[29:14] to where if you're not careful and you
[29:16] and you begin to take a fashion and you
[29:20] begin to take fashion statements and
[29:21] fashion trends and just accept
[29:22] everything that's hanging on the rack in
[29:24] the store you don't realize what Spirit
[29:26] created those clothes
[29:31] you said I can wear any color I want and
[29:33] be a man
[29:34] go ahead
[29:36] go ahead
[29:38] but God wants a separation
[29:40] God wants a clear separation
[29:43] amen
[29:45] I wear any shoes I want my brother man
[29:47] was pointing to the shoes he's pointing
[29:48] to the clothes
[29:50] he's pointing to the hair styles
[29:53] I mean since when did Men stop cutting
[29:56] their hair like men
[29:58] amen
[30:00] now a man wants to go to a fashion salon
[30:03] and get his hair done up
[30:05] I don't mean you've been here my
[30:07] goodness but we're talking about the
[30:08] culture
[30:09] my hair is pretty good
[30:12] I don't have to worry about slipping
[30:13] into kind of the wrong thing there
[30:17] but you see it all matters because
[30:19] there's Spirits Behind these things
[30:23] it's a culture that's pressing in and
[30:25] creating chaos in the world that's all
[30:28] around us
[30:30] I thank God I thank God that there's men
[30:33] that'll still put on a suit and tie and
[30:35] come to church
[30:36] regardless of what the fashion trends
[30:38] are and regardless of what's going on
[30:40] they'll show their respect to God
[30:42] and say I'm going to hear the word of
[30:44] God and I'm going to address myself in a
[30:47] way that's appropriate and masculine and
[30:49] go face my God and hear his word
[30:51] remember the word is a person
[30:55] we're not coming here to hear a lecture
[30:56] and hear a speech amen we're coming to
[30:59] hear the word of God through the method
[31:00] that God has laid down for us in this
[31:02] day and when coming so we're coming to
[31:04] meet God
[31:08] it's still worth getting dressed up for
[31:11] it's still an event worth putting on our
[31:14] best
[31:17] amen
[31:18] it's still worth coming like a lady and
[31:21] coming like a man to present ourselves
[31:23] to the Lord
[31:25] amen doesn't mean you have to wear
[31:28] certain that's not what we're saying we
[31:30] should just take effort to present
[31:32] ourselves to God
[31:35] nobody's going to chastise you if you
[31:37] don't wear a tie to church that's not
[31:38] the point the point is that we care
[31:42] that we're coming ready
[31:46] diligent respectful honoring God
[31:49] honoring his word
[31:51] these things matter friends
[31:53] we can say they don't matter but they do
[31:55] matter
[31:57] we can act like they don't and we can be
[31:59] come like a church that anything goes
[32:01] and everything's easy and everything's
[32:02] fine and God loves you and God loves
[32:04] everything you do and you come any way
[32:06] you want and you just come and you sing
[32:08] a nice song to God and accept it that's
[32:10] not the case
[32:12] that's the modern idea of worshiping God
[32:15] Amen but but just because that's the way
[32:17] you want to worship God doesn't mean
[32:18] that's the way God wants to be worshiped
[32:22] amen
[32:24] amen
[32:27] brother member says when you see a man
[32:28] acts like a there's something
[32:30] wrong
[32:31] when you see a woman that wants to act
[32:33] like a man there's something wrong see
[32:34] there's something wrong they are two
[32:36] different Spirits all together but
[32:38] together they make one unit these two
[32:40] are one
[32:43] when God made a man first he made him
[32:46] both male and female in spirit he made
[32:48] him in his own image and God is a spirit
[32:51] when he separated him and put him in
[32:52] flesh he put the masculine Spirit on a
[32:54] man in the feminist spirit and a woman
[32:56] and if anything's contrary to that
[32:58] there's a bit of perversion there
[32:59] exactly you see a woman trying to act
[33:02] like a man there's a little something
[33:03] wrong there
[33:05] the cells crossed up somewhere that's
[33:07] right you see a man so sisified that he
[33:09] won't preach against sin or nothing else
[33:11] like that to hurt somebody's feelings
[33:13] there's a cross up there somewhere too
[33:15] not only is natural birth but a
[33:17] spiritual birth
[33:19] oh we need today is that a man be a man
[33:22] a woman a lady God intend them to be
[33:24] that way dressed different he says you
[33:27] say you're hammering on us women now I'm
[33:29] going to tell you about the man
[33:31] any man that will let his wife smoke
[33:34] cigarettes and wear them shorts and act
[33:35] like that there's very little man in him
[33:37] to my opinion
[33:39] that's right I've got my opinion of a
[33:41] man that'll let his wife do that I sure
[33:43] have well he just told us his opinion
[33:47] and he wasn't afraid to because brother
[33:48] Venom was a man
[33:51] he was masculine he was a man he was
[33:53] authoritative he could speak his mind he
[33:55] told you what his convictions were
[33:57] he wasn't always waffling and and in the
[34:00] middle of the road and sparing
[34:01] everybody's feelings
[34:03] he was a man
[34:05] he was a man's man
[34:08] and we responded to that
[34:11] it drew us it called us
[34:14] it captivated us
[34:18] amen
[34:21] but I want you to see what brother
[34:22] Brown's looking at as a man
[34:25] I mean being a man is not just taking a
[34:28] gun and shooting game and going and
[34:30] eating raw meat in the wilderness
[34:33] that's not what he's talking about he's
[34:34] not talking about things that a man can
[34:37] be soft he doesn't have to be hard a man
[34:39] amen a man a man can work in business
[34:42] and be a man or he can be a lumberjack
[34:44] and be a man and they can have the same
[34:45] quality of manhood
[34:47] that's what we're talking about but
[34:49] brother Ben's talking about a man who
[34:50] will take responsibility and Authority
[34:52] for his household and stand and not
[34:54] allow sin to come in and brother bear
[34:57] said a man that will let his wife do
[34:58] this and a man that will let his wife do
[35:00] that I've gotta I I have not got too
[35:02] much of opinion of that man
[35:05] why it doesn't matter what his
[35:07] occupation is it doesn't matter what his
[35:09] hobbies are that's not what we're
[35:10] looking at as masculinity that's not
[35:12] what we're looking at as manhood we're
[35:13] looking at a man that will take his
[35:15] god-given position as the authority and
[35:17] ruler over the woman
[35:19] and not give it up and not be passive
[35:22] about it
[35:24] he said there's very little man in him
[35:26] to my opinion
[35:28] he said well what's the matter you say
[35:29] well brother Madam here's what it is man
[35:31] is not measured by strength this way
[35:34] oh you say that guy's a man he's six
[35:37] foot tall got muscles that big I've seen
[35:39] many of them weigh 200 pounds six foot
[35:41] and a half tall and not one ounce of man
[35:44] in them throw a baby out of a mother's
[35:46] arms and ravish her man's not measured
[35:48] that's Brute
[35:50] that's brute strength as man's measured
[35:52] by character
[35:53] there never was a man like Jesus Christ
[35:56] never measured up to him and the Bible
[35:58] said there's no Beauty we should desire
[35:59] him didn't look like a king he was a
[36:01] little bitty fellow probably stoop
[36:04] little small and stature but there never
[36:06] was a man like him man is measured by
[36:09] character not by brutal strength
[36:11] [Music]
[36:13] you don't have to be mean and arrogant
[36:15] and harsh and Brash to be a man
[36:18] but you are going to have to stand
[36:21] and when nobody else stands and you're
[36:23] going to have to be straight and you're
[36:24] going to have to be firm and you're
[36:25] going to have to have a backbone to be a
[36:27] man
[36:29] you don't have to be loud you don't have
[36:30] to be aggressive
[36:32] but you must be authoritative
[36:34] you must be firm in your convictions you
[36:37] must be honest in your approach you must
[36:39] not be wishy-washy
[36:44] this is what the prophet lays out for us
[36:48] men will get into sports to feel like a
[36:51] man
[36:51] and won't rule their own house and turn
[36:53] that over to their wife and there's no
[36:55] man in that man
[36:57] you can dunk a basketball run the
[36:59] 40-yard dash faster than anybody he can
[37:01] he can do more than any other man do it
[37:03] longer do it harder do it faster and
[37:05] he's not even a man
[37:07] because he's not in his position as a
[37:09] man
[37:10] he's letting his wife take that position
[37:12] and now he's not a man
[37:16] he's male
[37:18] not a man
[37:23] sometimes the truth is just the truth
[37:26] it's not always Pleasant it's not always
[37:28] feeling good but it's just the truth
[37:32] when we go back to Genesis chapter 3
[37:35] well find where God lays this out
[37:40] Genesis chapter 3 verse 16.
[37:45] and he says here unto the woman he said
[37:47] I will greatly multiply and thy sorrow
[37:49] and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[37:52] bring forth children and thy desire
[37:54] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[37:57] rule over thee
[37:59] this was the order that God set down
[38:01] this is the pattern that God fixed
[38:04] and this is the one that God wants
[38:06] he wanted the masculine Spirit to rule
[38:09] over the feminist spirit and that was
[38:11] for protection because God when he
[38:12] separated them out he separated the
[38:14] masculine from the feminist he knew in
[38:17] the way that he was created being a
[38:18] byproduct amen that there was a
[38:20] susceptibility there and he allowed it
[38:22] to go because then there was a fall and
[38:24] it gave God the opportunity to express
[38:25] all of his attributes but after that
[38:28] fall he took that feminist nature that
[38:30] had been separated out and placed it
[38:31] under the rulership of the male of the
[38:33] masculine and he said he shall have rule
[38:36] over thee and that's the way God wants
[38:38] it to this day
[38:40] it may have been approximately six
[38:41] thousand years since he said this but
[38:43] that's still how he wants it to be
[38:47] that's still how the role should be
[38:48] played
[38:49] brother random said and some of you men
[38:52] will get that Wishbone out of you and
[38:54] get a real and get a real be a man
[38:58] Backbone in you
[39:01] say God help me
[39:03] and make your wife straighten up spank
[39:05] that little daughter of yours running
[39:07] around there on the street and some man
[39:08] insult her and then you go around and
[39:10] want to have the man arrested you ought
[39:12] to have a whipping you're the guy you
[39:14] brother that's right you're the one you
[39:16] ought to be the ruler of your house
[39:18] God's holding you responsible the way
[39:20] you're letting that girl do let her come
[39:22] in of a nighttime her hair all must up
[39:24] in a cigarette and pain all over her
[39:25] face I got two I don't know what they'll
[39:28] do but one thing brother as long as I
[39:30] got life and a barrel slots laying close
[39:32] I'll do my part
[39:36] I love reading these quotes
[39:39] because if I say those things
[39:41] it's like ah brother Chad's being harmed
[39:43] today no I'm just reading what the
[39:45] prophet said amen
[39:47] but what brother man was saying is he
[39:50] said you're the man be a man have a
[39:51] backbone you make things right you stand
[39:54] in the game you be the Watchman on the
[39:56] wall you make sure the house is lined up
[39:58] don't leave that to other people and
[40:00] don't turn that over to your woman and
[40:01] don't turn your wife and don't turn it
[40:03] over to your children you take position
[40:04] that's what it is to be a man
[40:08] that's what he's talking about be Burly
[40:11] he's not talking about you know grow out
[40:13] a great big beard and let your hair go
[40:15] and beeper he's talking about have some
[40:17] grit about you when it comes to
[40:19] leadership
[40:23] amen you know why because not
[40:25] everybody's going to agree with every
[40:27] decision you make
[40:29] and not every decision you make will be
[40:31] right either
[40:32] we just lay that out here right from the
[40:34] beginning
[40:36] just because you're masculine doesn't
[40:38] mean you're right
[40:41] amen
[40:43] all of us men will make a heap of
[40:45] mistakes and that's why I mean Jesus
[40:47] Christ is perfect amen God is perfect
[40:49] he's perfect in every way but we're not
[40:52] and so to take our positions sometimes
[40:54] we'll get it right sometimes we'll get
[40:55] it wrong and it's going to require a
[40:57] whole lot of humility to stand in your
[40:59] place when you failed to be able to come
[41:01] back and say that was me
[41:03] I was wrong I made the wrong decision
[41:05] there I shouldn't have done that
[41:06] amen that's what it's going to require
[41:08] as long as we live in flesh
[41:10] but just because you've made a heap of
[41:12] mistakes amen does not take away your
[41:15] responsibility to be the ruler
[41:19] it's almost like three strikes you're
[41:21] out turn it over to the woman
[41:24] that doesn't work
[41:26] that will never work it can never be
[41:28] that way and be God's way
[41:31] it must be we must have the humility as
[41:33] brothers as men amen the backbone in
[41:36] ourselves to say I was wrong
[41:39] I thought that was right wrong decision
[41:41] poor decision that was a selfish move
[41:42] I'm sorry for saying that I'm sorry for
[41:44] do that that was too rough that was too
[41:46] this we need to come back to our
[41:48] families we need to come back and say I
[41:49] was wrong
[41:51] I was wrong and there's nothing wrong
[41:53] with saying I was wrong amen but don't
[41:55] ever let that cause you to lose your
[41:58] position because the minute you do you
[41:59] subject the whole household amen and you
[42:02] open the door and open the gate for
[42:04] troubles to begin
[42:08] let's go to First Peter chapter three
[42:24] First Peter chapter 3.
[42:33] praise God First Peter chapter 3 verse
[42:35] 1. likewise your wives be in subjection
[42:38] to your own husbands to have any obey
[42:41] not the word they also May without the
[42:43] word be won by the conversation of the
[42:45] wise
[42:46] while they behold your Chase
[42:47] conversation coupled with fear
[42:51] amen how was the woman supposed to save
[42:53] her unbelieving husband
[42:56] by a tongue lashing by preaching to him
[42:58] by telling them how wrong he is
[43:01] with her chaste conversation coupled
[43:04] with fear
[43:05] that word fear is reverence
[43:08] it's her Chastity her chaste lifestyle
[43:11] coupled with her reverence for God in
[43:13] reverence her husband that might win her
[43:15] husband
[43:17] not when she becomes spiritually
[43:18] dominant because she's spiritual and
[43:20] he's not
[43:22] that'll not work
[43:25] not because she preaches at him because
[43:26] she's spiritual and he's not that won't
[43:28] work either
[43:30] how can she win the unbelieving Heaven
[43:32] by her chaste conversation that's her
[43:34] lifestyle coupled with her fear her
[43:37] reverence her respect
[43:39] that's how she'll do it
[43:41] if everybody stays in their Lane it
[43:43] works
[43:45] when we start getting out of our lane
[43:46] then we start bringing chaos and things
[43:49] begin to fall apart but if we stay in
[43:51] our lanes no matter where we are God
[43:53] will bless it and it begins to have the
[43:55] affected result
[43:59] it goes on in verse three who's adorning
[44:01] let it not be that outward adorning of
[44:04] plaiting of the hair and of wearing of
[44:05] gold or putting on of apparel
[44:08] but let it be the hidden man of the
[44:09] heart and that which is not corruptable
[44:11] even the ornament of a Meek and quiet
[44:13] Spirit which is in the sight of God
[44:15] great price for after this manner in the
[44:19] old time the holy women also who trusted
[44:21] in God Adorn themselves being in
[44:23] subjection unto their own husbands even
[44:26] as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[44:28] whose daughters ye are as long as you do
[44:30] well and are not afraid with any
[44:33] amazement likewise ye husbands dwell
[44:36] with them according to knowledge giving
[44:38] honor unto the wife is unto the weaker
[44:40] vessel and is being heirs together of
[44:42] the grace of life that your prayers be
[44:44] not hindered
[44:47] this way of always keeping everything in
[44:49] balance
[44:50] through the masculine the feminist he
[44:53] sits here and he begins through Peter he
[44:55] begins to lay down that a woman is to be
[44:57] subjected to her husband like the Holy
[44:59] Women of old were subjected to their
[45:01] husband amen and and and how to do that
[45:04] and he begins to tell them but then he
[45:06] turns right around he comes to the man
[45:07] he says now dwell with your wives
[45:09] according to knowledge you need to
[45:10] understand she's different than you
[45:13] and respect the feminine nature in her
[45:16] he says he says it this way
[45:19] you need to dwell with them according to
[45:21] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[45:23] unto the weaker vessel and being heirs
[45:25] together the grace of life that your
[45:27] prayers be not hindered
[45:29] you need so badly to understand this and
[45:31] get this that it doesn't hinder your
[45:32] prayer life
[45:35] and that God can continue to answer your
[45:36] prayers
[45:38] why because the woman is the weaker
[45:40] vessel is not the less valuable vessel
[45:43] the woman is the weaker vessel is the
[45:44] one that's more fragile more tender more
[45:46] gentle and she needs shelter and she
[45:49] needs care
[45:50] she needs a man to dwell with her
[45:52] according to knowledge
[45:53] and give honor to her as a weaker vessel
[45:55] amen that's part of leadership
[45:58] that's part of being a ruler So Gone
[46:00] amen he never comes along and says you
[46:03] be subject you be subject you be subject
[46:05] amen and the man can just act anyway
[46:07] once he turns right around and says now
[46:09] you dwell with her according to
[46:10] knowledge and give honor as a weaker
[46:12] vessel that your prayers aren't hindered
[46:16] amen because any time we remove one of
[46:20] these attributes we're starting to blur
[46:22] the image of God anytime we disrespect
[46:24] the feminine attribute we blur the image
[46:26] of God we disrespect the masculine we
[46:28] blur the image of God these two must be
[46:30] here in their positions in their place
[46:33] working in Harmony and unity to display
[46:35] what God wants displayed in this hour
[46:39] amen the world needs men
[46:46] let's go to Ephesians chapter 5.
[47:03] Ephesians chapter 5.
[47:05] and we'll go to verse 21.
[47:13] submitting yourselves one to another in
[47:15] the fear of God wives submit yourselves
[47:17] into your own husbands as unto the Lord
[47:19] for the husband is head of the wife even
[47:21] as Christ is head of the church and he
[47:23] is the savior of the body therefore as
[47:25] the church is subject into Christ so let
[47:27] wives be to their own husbands in
[47:28] everything
[47:29] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[47:32] also loved the church and gave himself
[47:34] for it
[47:35] you see God bring the balance between
[47:37] the two attributes once again
[47:39] there's no way around it the man must
[47:41] rule his home
[47:42] no question without questioning I know
[47:45] none of you have that question because
[47:46] we have Godly sisters and godly brothers
[47:48] who believe the word of God but just
[47:50] rehearsing that there must be the
[47:52] masculine Spirit there must be the
[47:53] masculine nature and he must take
[47:54] dominion and rulership over his home
[47:56] because that's what it means when God
[47:58] told the man or told the woman The man
[48:00] shall rule over you it means to have
[48:02] dominion or rulership
[48:04] and so man must take that but he also
[48:07] must love his wife as Christ loved the
[48:09] church
[48:12] so how should I love my wife the same
[48:13] way Christ loved the church how did
[48:15] Christ love the church he gave himself
[48:16] for it Christ did not become effeminate
[48:19] for his wife he didn't become overly
[48:22] emotional and he didn't go to his wife
[48:23] and say now okay I understand that that
[48:26] this is hard for you we're just going to
[48:28] change this Rule and go with your
[48:30] emotions and this is no he stayed true
[48:32] to the word of God in all ways amen but
[48:35] he gave himself to shelter and protect
[48:37] his wife
[48:39] amen
[48:41] amen and loved her as his own body
[48:43] because that's what she is
[48:46] amen many times when I do pre-marital
[48:48] counseling with those who are going to
[48:49] get married I go to this and I go to
[48:51] verse Ephesians
[48:53] 5 32 let's skip over to 32. and I and I
[48:57] want to go through this because I want
[48:58] to show some of the things that I do
[49:00] when I begin to teach them in verse 32
[49:02] it says this is a great mystery but I
[49:04] speak concerning Christ in the church
[49:06] nevertheless let every one of you in
[49:09] particular so love his wife even as
[49:10] himself
[49:11] and the wife see that she reverends her
[49:13] husband
[49:15] when I get down to this scripture I tell
[49:17] them many times I said if there's one
[49:18] thing you get out of our talks here
[49:20] today when we meet together before
[49:22] you're married there's one scripture you
[49:24] remember if there's one verse you put on
[49:25] your refrigerator to have a successful
[49:27] marriage it'll be verse 33.
[49:30] And if every married couple of every
[49:32] family can operate in verse 33 there
[49:35] will never be a problem
[49:38] because it's the key it says
[49:39] nevertheless let every one of you in
[49:41] particular so love his wife even as
[49:43] himself
[49:44] you love her and prefer her and care for
[49:47] her and be tender with her amen love her
[49:50] and the wife see that she reverence our
[49:53] respects and honors her husband
[49:55] why is this key because this is the way
[49:58] God set it up and this is the way that
[50:00] it actually works
[50:02] I do a little exercise sometimes when I
[50:04] have a a young couple ready to get
[50:06] married and they're sitting in my office
[50:08] we're talking and I say listen and I I
[50:12] start to I start to uh make some phrases
[50:14] I say okay let's say this young man
[50:16] looks at you and he says you know what
[50:19] you are so precious and dear to me I
[50:22] love you I love everything about you
[50:23] when you walk by my heart skips a beat I
[50:26] can't stop thinking about you and you're
[50:28] the sweetest thing God ever made and I
[50:29] asked the sister I said does that kind
[50:31] of talk feel good she said oh yeah
[50:33] that feels good
[50:35] then I say I go to the young man I say
[50:37] okay now this sister looks at you and
[50:39] says you are such a sweetie you're a
[50:41] sweetie pie
[50:42] you're so gentle and sweet and tender
[50:44] and everything about you
[50:47] I told the brother I said I mean it's
[50:49] not bad
[50:51] I mean it's not bad it's okay
[50:54] but what if she looks at you and says
[50:55] you know what I really respect you for
[50:57] the kind of man you are
[50:59] I look up to you and admire you for the
[51:01] standard taken the life that you live
[51:03] and and I could place myself under your
[51:06] headship because I respect and honor you
[51:08] now you guys tell me which one do you
[51:10] want to hear on a regular basis
[51:13] do you want to be the sweetest guy at
[51:15] work
[51:16] you're in the weld shop
[51:19] and all the other welders look at you
[51:20] and says he is the sweetest guy in this
[51:24] show
[51:26] it doesn't move the men it doesn't move
[51:29] because that's not the way they're made
[51:31] that's not their position there's
[51:33] nothing wrong with being sweet and if
[51:34] your wife looks at you and say you're
[51:35] being so sweet that feels good too but
[51:37] that I mean that can't be all there is
[51:39] to it amen there's got to be some more
[51:41] but when your wife looks at you and says
[51:43] you know I really respect you for what
[51:44] you just did
[51:46] I'm telling you you're going to make a
[51:48] man out of that man by the way you speak
[51:50] to him
[51:51] and if you want a man to be your
[51:52] Defender and your protector and stand on
[51:54] the front line and shield you from dark
[51:56] you keep talking to that man that way
[51:58] and that man will go slay a dragon for
[52:00] you
[52:01] is that right
[52:03] he'll give his whole life to you why
[52:04] because that's what God called him for
[52:07] and if you love him that way you Empower
[52:09] him to be what God called him to be but
[52:12] if you look at your wife and say you
[52:13] know I really respect the way you work
[52:15] around here
[52:19] you put in a good day's work like a man
[52:22] you're not lounging around
[52:27] something about is not working
[52:30] and if you're just now realizing today
[52:32] that that's not good
[52:35] Take Your Wife by the hand and come see
[52:37] me
[52:38] we'll make an appointment
[52:42] because we have to respect the nature
[52:44] that God made in each one
[52:46] amen and we have to know what God's
[52:48] wanting to do through the man and what
[52:49] God's doing to the woman and when we
[52:51] understand that and Empower that and
[52:52] respect that
[52:55] then all of a sudden you have a marriage
[52:56] that moves into harmony into unity and
[52:58] everything's operating the way God wants
[53:00] it to operate and we begin to move
[53:01] forward that way
[53:03] and so if we can get this verse right in
[53:07] our homes then a man love his wife even
[53:10] as himself and see that the wife
[53:11] reverends her husband you're going to
[53:12] have success after success in every
[53:14] trouble do this in every difficulty do
[53:17] this every day do this and you're going
[53:19] to have a successful marriage
[53:21] it will work because that's the way God
[53:23] intended for it to work
[53:26] amen
[53:27] but see what happens in our culture the
[53:30] culture now has feminized men and the
[53:33] culture has made masculinity negative or
[53:36] they've made masculinity brutality
[53:39] they've done one or the other they've
[53:41] made it brutality or they they've made
[53:43] it uh they made it brutal or cruel and
[53:46] now you're not supposed to be a man and
[53:48] stand for convictions and take
[53:49] leadership and tell your wife no and
[53:51] tell your children no and say stop that
[53:53] you're not allowed to do that I I'm not
[53:55] allowing this in my home and all of a
[53:57] sudden the culture all of a sudden
[53:58] flares up and says what gives you the
[53:59] right to say that and I say God gives me
[54:01] the right to say that
[54:03] not just the right but the
[54:05] responsibility and I'll answer to God if
[54:07] I don't take my position
[54:09] it's not an ego trip it's a fear of God
[54:12] it's a respect and reverence for God
[54:17] my goodness where is the man where are
[54:21] the men that can be men where are the
[54:22] men that can go to work you go to work
[54:24] and you have a discussion and now the
[54:26] men have to talk like women
[54:28] because of feelings and and there's
[54:30] women mixed into the workplace and now
[54:33] you get into a work setting and the men
[54:35] have to be so careful and you know you
[54:37] got to phrase it this way and be
[54:38] respectful and we have equality and
[54:40] inclusion and diversity and all of these
[54:42] things and you have to watch your speech
[54:44] and nobody can be wrong and no idea is
[54:46] stupid and the way it used to work with
[54:48] men is they could go to work and
[54:50] somebody says I think I'm going to
[54:51] change this chain around this log and
[54:53] you say if you do that you'll be dead
[54:54] that's a stupid idea
[54:57] and the man says what do you mean it
[54:58] makes sense to me and you say no
[54:59] knucklehead look at this and they battle
[55:01] it out and come together and at the end
[55:03] they're like oh yeah you're right or I
[55:05] see what you know okay all right thanks
[55:06] and they take it and they do it and they
[55:08] why they're men
[55:12] now men sit around in the room what do
[55:15] you think
[55:16] well what do you think well what do you
[55:18] think
[55:19] well I think well let's go with what you
[55:21] think
[55:23] so that I don't hurt your feelings
[55:26] yes sir
[55:28] that's how we get into a world that's so
[55:30] upside down and backwards
[55:33] it's so crazy amen you you've heard in
[55:36] the news what the schools are dealing
[55:38] with we talked about it for dealing with
[55:40] boys wanting to go in the girls
[55:41] bathrooms girls in the boys bathrooms
[55:43] they're wanting to put litter boxes into
[55:45] the bathroom because they want to be
[55:46] dogs and they want to be cats and the
[55:48] school board having special meetings to
[55:50] try to figure out how to handle this
[55:52] I'll tell you to handle this they need
[55:53] one man to stand up in that school board
[55:55] and said this is ridiculous we educate
[55:58] human beings that were born male or
[56:00] female if you want to go home and you
[56:02] want to use a litter box have at it if
[56:04] you want to go home and dress like a
[56:06] girl have at it but when you come
[56:07] through those doors we've got rules here
[56:09] and for the sake of everybody else a boy
[56:12] that's born a boy is a boy a girl that's
[56:14] born a girl is a girl and you're not a
[56:16] dog or a cat you don't even belong in
[56:18] school you need to go to obedience class
[56:25] if we would have men who would be men I
[56:29] mean they might get voted off for the
[56:30] next school board but everybody in that
[56:32] room would know he's right and they're
[56:33] wrong
[56:36] but instead of that they have to say
[56:38] well I think the general feeling is and
[56:41] the parents have told me
[56:47] why the culture has become feminine
[56:51] and the only expression of masculinity
[56:53] is now in brutality
[56:56] and they wonder why boys are blowing
[56:57] stuff up on video games
[57:01] why they're shooting stuff up and
[57:03] blowing stuff up with War Games what's
[57:04] the attraction because they're still
[57:06] Male inside
[57:09] and you're forcing them to act like a
[57:11] girl
[57:14] it's not working
[57:16] we need men who will be men we need
[57:18] women who will be ladies
[57:21] and the whole thing if we respect one
[57:23] another
[57:24] in reverence one another in their
[57:26] position it will work
[57:30] there is no problem in schools when men
[57:33] were in charge
[57:36] but most of the schools now are run by
[57:38] women most of the teachers became women
[57:43] it began to change
[57:45] right
[57:46] and they become feminine
[57:48] and now nobody can stand up and say
[57:50] what's right is right what's wrong is
[57:52] wrong
[57:55] I may be on the school board one day but
[57:58] if I was there one day
[58:01] somebody would know what was right and
[58:03] what was wrong
[58:03] [Music]
[58:05] and I wouldn't be mean about it
[58:07] that's not manhood
[58:09] you don't have to be rough
[58:11] you have to be truthful and honest
[58:16] we had a prophet in our day who said
[58:18] some rough things
[58:20] and I'm not ashamed of those rough
[58:22] things some people are ashamed of them
[58:24] and tried to overlook them and say well
[58:26] he had a in his childhood if you
[58:28] understood how he grew up and his dad
[58:29] drinking and
[58:31] listen he went through what God wanted
[58:33] him to go through to get trained the way
[58:34] God wanted me to be trained God was with
[58:36] him in his temperament because there's a
[58:38] certain way the gospel had to be
[58:40] preached in this generation to call for
[58:43] a certain people
[58:45] [Music]
[58:48] and brother Branham said and he's
[58:49] preaching in The Invisible Union of the
[58:51] bride of Christ he says now real quietly
[58:53] I'm going to ask consecrated men and
[58:55] women who really know God most of them
[58:58] it's very strange it seems like it's
[59:00] that way altar calls that I make is
[59:02] mostly men
[59:04] he mentioned this is a couple places in
[59:05] the message
[59:06] you know in the regular run it's women
[59:09] but it's all men here I think there's
[59:12] one woman at the altar maybe two It's
[59:14] usually the women
[59:16] and brother bear mentions this in
[59:18] another place or two one or two other
[59:19] places that it seems like at his altar
[59:23] calls it's mostly men
[59:25] and even goes on to say I think the
[59:27] women think I'm a little rough on them
[59:28] or a little against them but in my
[59:30] opinion I don't think that was it at all
[59:32] I think the men could respond to its
[59:35] preaching
[59:36] I think his preaching may have been a
[59:39] little straight it may have been a
[59:40] little cutting it may have been firm
[59:41] amen but that was a message I could
[59:44] respond to
[59:46] I listened all my life to a feminine
[59:49] message I listened to all my be nice be
[59:51] sweet be kind don't say nothing bad be
[59:53] good to this and do this and do all that
[59:55] and as a boy amen there is nothing there
[59:58] was no attraction I wanted to serve God
[1:00:00] absolutely wanted to be a Christian
[1:00:01] wanted to serve God but there was no
[1:00:03] attraction to that kind of gospel
[1:00:05] because there was nothing being preached
[1:00:06] that was drawing me into my position as
[1:00:09] a man
[1:00:11] but when brother Branham priests all of
[1:00:13] a sudden and what is he doing it's like
[1:00:15] he's taking a hickory switch and
[1:00:17] switching the entire generation and
[1:00:19] switching all the Pentecostals and all
[1:00:21] of a sudden the men under that kind of
[1:00:23] talking Straight Talk amen under honest
[1:00:26] honest conviction honest true manhood
[1:00:29] amen the men could respond to that kind
[1:00:32] of preaching
[1:00:34] he said in my meetings it's mostly men
[1:00:38] well I say praise God because if you get
[1:00:40] the man right and in his position it'll
[1:00:42] bless the whole home
[1:00:46] that's why God made him in such a way
[1:00:48] amen because
[1:00:50] because that nature must be displayed
[1:00:52] and that nature it was drawing men
[1:00:56] it was pulling preachers back out of
[1:00:58] denomination it was bringing people out
[1:01:01] of systems and out of this whole thing
[1:01:03] that's moving feminine
[1:01:05] amen and it becomes so dangerous
[1:01:09] in the Book of Job I'm just going to
[1:01:10] read this to you quickly Job 38 go going
[1:01:14] through all of his trials and he's got
[1:01:15] all this hardship and and all these
[1:01:18] things have happened to him and then all
[1:01:19] of it his three friends come and and
[1:01:21] they're accusing him the fourth one
[1:01:24] Ellie who was in the place of God he
[1:01:26] begins to correct him
[1:01:27] then after that says then the Lord
[1:01:29] answered job out of a whirlwind and said
[1:01:30] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[1:01:33] words without knowledge gird up now thy
[1:01:35] loins like a man for I will demand a
[1:01:37] thee and answer thou me
[1:01:40] what did God say he told job I'm going
[1:01:42] to talk to you like a man
[1:01:45] gird up your loins get up get dressed
[1:01:48] I'm going to talk to you and I'm going
[1:01:49] to demand of you an answer
[1:01:51] and he begins I love the way God talks
[1:01:53] to him he says where was thou when I
[1:01:55] laid the foundation of the Earth
[1:01:57] you're here groveling you're here
[1:01:59] whining amen you're here thinking you
[1:02:01] know something amen but listen I'm gonna
[1:02:03] you you gird up your loins like a man
[1:02:06] I'm coming down to talk to you like a
[1:02:08] man and you answer me where were you
[1:02:10] when we drew the foundation where where
[1:02:12] were you what have you done who Do You
[1:02:14] Think You Are
[1:02:20] oh praise the Lord
[1:02:23] something in me says that's right
[1:02:28] that's right
[1:02:30] when the angel Lord comes to Zach
[1:02:32] Zacchaeus not Zacchaeus Zacharias
[1:02:36] in Elizabeth Zacharias was in the temple
[1:02:39] and and the angel comes and presents
[1:02:40] himself it's time for the promise to be
[1:02:42] fulfilled
[1:02:44] and he questions how could this be
[1:02:46] well he's a man and he's a priest and
[1:02:49] he's got a Bible example
[1:02:51] so what is God what does the angel said
[1:02:53] to you because you doubted you'll not
[1:02:55] speak until the baby's born
[1:02:59] I mean
[1:03:01] really that's harsh but he should have
[1:03:04] known better
[1:03:06] he comes to Mary now the same Angel
[1:03:08] comes to Mary and Mary does the same
[1:03:10] thing how can this be sing I know no man
[1:03:12] but she's a woman she's not a priest she
[1:03:14] doesn't have authority she's of a
[1:03:15] different nature and there's no example
[1:03:17] in the Bible and he never smites her
[1:03:20] dumb never punishes or never does
[1:03:21] anything just goes ahead and answers her
[1:03:23] question
[1:03:27] you don't deal with men and women the
[1:03:29] same
[1:03:30] you don't raise boys and girls the same
[1:03:35] me and the boys were one day sitting
[1:03:36] down trying to figure out how to do
[1:03:37] something I don't know what it was
[1:03:39] it could have been anything from throw a
[1:03:41] ball to build a deck
[1:03:43] but we're hashing it out this long and
[1:03:45] this this and that and these material
[1:03:47] and all that I don't remember what it
[1:03:48] was but we're hashing it out and we're
[1:03:50] going at the table back and forth back
[1:03:52] and forth and my wife goes why are you
[1:03:54] guys arguing
[1:03:55] and we all stopped and we're like we're
[1:03:57] not arguing
[1:04:03] no
[1:04:07] we're fine
[1:04:10] I'd never catch her and the girls
[1:04:11] talking that way
[1:04:13] the conversation would be completely
[1:04:14] different it's a different nature
[1:04:18] that's why in the home you must have a
[1:04:21] father and a mother
[1:04:22] both in position with the freedom to
[1:04:25] express their nature
[1:04:27] we start to distort that and things
[1:04:28] start to get
[1:04:30] ah they start to fall out of place
[1:04:34] God can come down to his son job and
[1:04:36] said
[1:04:37] gird thy loins like a man I'm going to
[1:04:40] talk to you
[1:04:44] what was he doing
[1:04:46] God was bringing job back into a
[1:04:49] position of respect
[1:04:52] and God was about to take his position
[1:04:55] and keep job in his position
[1:04:59] and did job respond well to that
[1:05:02] yes
[1:05:04] he said I spoke once I'll never speak
[1:05:06] again I open my mouth twice I'll put my
[1:05:08] hand over my mouth lest I speak again
[1:05:10] for now I know I'm just a man and you're
[1:05:12] a God
[1:05:13] God put him in his position
[1:05:16] and it was good for job
[1:05:19] when we paint the picture like if we
[1:05:22] make God like we make the modern Church
[1:05:25] or like the modern man just sweet and
[1:05:28] just gentle and he's syrupy sweet and
[1:05:29] sugar and he he's this and he's that and
[1:05:32] he loves you so much and never but God
[1:05:34] can come to you anytime and say Gert
[1:05:35] your loins like a man I'm going to ask
[1:05:37] you some questions
[1:05:39] who Do You Think You Are
[1:05:41] talking to me like that
[1:05:48] this is where the modern church has
[1:05:50] failed
[1:05:52] that's why they don't have men in
[1:05:53] leadership anymore that's why when their
[1:05:55] boys get to be 13 14 they take off
[1:05:57] they're gone because they're preached a
[1:05:59] feminist message
[1:06:01] they're preached a feminine Christ only
[1:06:03] not balanced but just one-sided
[1:06:08] I'm so glad God sent a man to be the
[1:06:10] prophet
[1:06:11] in this day
[1:06:13] he could draw masculinity back in place
[1:06:16] and in that man who is so Burly and so
[1:06:20] strong with his conviction is so honest
[1:06:22] and straight was super tender with
[1:06:24] sisters
[1:06:25] very respectful and a gentleman at all
[1:06:28] times
[1:06:32] you don't have to be rough you certainly
[1:06:35] shouldn't be rough with women or
[1:06:36] children
[1:06:38] to be a man
[1:06:40] but you've got to take your position
[1:06:43] I remember I mean there's times
[1:06:45] sometimes I have old terms I picked up I
[1:06:47] don't know for my dad or where
[1:06:50] but every once in a while sometimes you
[1:06:52] just have to Rack somebody's Jaws you
[1:06:54] know
[1:06:56] I mean that may sound rough but my dad
[1:06:58] did it to me
[1:07:00] my dad would say boy what do you think
[1:07:02] you're doing no you're not doing that
[1:07:03] that's that's crazy and he'll say stuff
[1:07:05] like Over My Dead Body you'll never do
[1:07:07] that
[1:07:09] and you know what
[1:07:11] I stand here today and thank God for a
[1:07:14] dad
[1:07:16] who wouldn't be wishy-washy with me
[1:07:19] but would be honest with me and I look
[1:07:21] back and he was right I was about to do
[1:07:24] something very very foolish
[1:07:26] at the time I didn't know it I thought
[1:07:27] my dad was just rough and half blind and
[1:07:30] didn't understand nothing and I look
[1:07:32] back and he was dead on the money
[1:07:34] I could respond to that
[1:07:37] and something in me knew not to push
[1:07:39] against that
[1:07:42] now on mom the other hand
[1:07:44] mom would say no I don't think so
[1:07:47] but Mom Mom I really want to Mom all the
[1:07:52] other guys are doing it and all of a
[1:07:53] sudden Mom's heart
[1:07:55] is beginning to melt
[1:07:58] Mom I'm the only one oh my goodness now
[1:08:01] she's almost caved in
[1:08:04] my my little boy is going to be made fun
[1:08:07] of his feelings are going to be heard
[1:08:09] he's going to feel like he's different
[1:08:10] than all the other little boys
[1:08:13] and that boy will push moan
[1:08:16] and what is he doing he's he's
[1:08:18] manipulating her emotions he doesn't may
[1:08:20] not understand that but he's
[1:08:22] manipulating her emotions amen and if
[1:08:24] she's not careful she's going to get
[1:08:26] hooked in emotionally and this boy's
[1:08:28] going to run the show amen and now amen
[1:08:31] she's going to agree to something at
[1:08:33] first she did not want to agree to
[1:08:35] and didn't feel comfortable agreeing to
[1:08:38] and that's where it's nice when Mom can
[1:08:40] say I see what you're saying honey go
[1:08:42] ask your dad
[1:08:49] and dad says what planet did you just
[1:08:51] show up from there's no way that's ever
[1:08:53] going to work in a million years
[1:08:55] and you know what that young man can
[1:08:57] respond to that and know not to push
[1:08:59] anymore and stop right there and say
[1:09:00] that's it that's final
[1:09:02] why can't he with Mom but why can't he
[1:09:04] with Dad because it's a masculine Spirit
[1:09:06] speaking to a masculine spirit and
[1:09:08] what's happening is he's drawing
[1:09:09] masculinity out of that boy by the way
[1:09:11] he talks to him
[1:09:14] to others it may look rough it may look
[1:09:16] why it should be but what he's doing is
[1:09:18] he's drawing a boy to come back into
[1:09:20] respect and a boy can respect respect
[1:09:24] he can understand reverence and respect
[1:09:26] in manhood amen and when a man will
[1:09:29] speak to his son not mean not calling
[1:09:31] him names not not any of that but say
[1:09:33] there ain't no way that's not a good
[1:09:34] idea and this is not going to happen and
[1:09:36] I'm not going to allow it and I don't
[1:09:37] stand for that amen and when that boy
[1:09:39] all of a sudden he can respect that
[1:09:43] and you're drawing masculinity out of a
[1:09:45] boy
[1:09:48] that's why it's good to have a father
[1:09:51] a Godly Daddy
[1:09:53] who will take his position and stand and
[1:09:56] represent that nature of God to you
[1:10:00] and it's good to have a mother who'll
[1:10:01] stay in her position and represent that
[1:10:03] nature of God
[1:10:04] because we need both
[1:10:07] I remember one of our boys I'm telling
[1:10:09] all now this is a book I mean sorry kids
[1:10:12] I love you all
[1:10:13] it's Father's Day you have to forgive me
[1:10:14] and love me anyhow
[1:10:16] it'd be nice I already got my Father's
[1:10:18] Day present so I can say whatever I want
[1:10:19] now
[1:10:21] so
[1:10:26] but when a boy gets to be a certain age
[1:10:29] he starts to this is naturally creeping
[1:10:32] up in him especially if he's had Godly
[1:10:33] examples
[1:10:35] and he'll start to test his authority
[1:10:37] with his mother
[1:10:39] that's normal
[1:10:42] don't lose your mind
[1:10:44] that's normal
[1:10:45] he'll start to contradict her he'll
[1:10:47] start to correct her and tell her where
[1:10:48] she's wrong especially when it comes to
[1:10:50] driving
[1:10:52] or fixing things
[1:10:55] and all of a sudden mom doesn't know
[1:10:57] anything about cars nothing about
[1:10:59] driving what she never claimed to
[1:11:01] but all sudden he starts to usurp a bit
[1:11:04] of authority he tries to correct and he
[1:11:05] tries to tell her what's right and and
[1:11:07] mom's gonna have to endure that because
[1:11:09] she wants him to be a little man and a
[1:11:11] father of a household
[1:11:13] she can't Crush that if she crushes that
[1:11:15] then you got a female Spirit dominating
[1:11:18] that little male Spirit that's trying to
[1:11:19] express you got to let it express a
[1:11:22] little bit but that's where Dad has to
[1:11:24] take control not Mom Dad
[1:11:27] and we had a situation in our house
[1:11:28] where one of the boys I won't tell you
[1:11:30] which one I won't call names but it was
[1:11:32] the oldest one
[1:11:33] and they were
[1:11:37] and he come into this position now where
[1:11:40] he's just challenging challenging
[1:11:41] challenging not in a bad way and not
[1:11:44] horrible but challenging and and the
[1:11:46] challenge sometimes with borderline on
[1:11:47] disrespect there's times it could be
[1:11:49] disrespectful
[1:11:50] and that's where I come to him I say
[1:11:52] listen
[1:11:53] that woman you're talking to is your
[1:11:55] mother
[1:11:56] but she's not just your mother she's my
[1:11:58] wife
[1:11:59] and I will not let any man on this
[1:12:02] planet speak to my wife in a
[1:12:03] disrespectful way and if you dishonor
[1:12:05] your mother you have me to deal with
[1:12:09] you know what there's no problem then
[1:12:11] the problem went away
[1:12:13] why because now I drew out of him
[1:12:16] masculinity I didn't say you stopped
[1:12:19] being so rough you'd be a sweet boy and
[1:12:20] listen to your mom she could sweeten you
[1:12:22] up and really teach you how to be
[1:12:23] tenderhearted
[1:12:25] that boy's going to be like my goodness
[1:12:27] can't wait till I'm 18.
[1:12:31] true mom can't do that Dad can
[1:12:35] if Mom does it she's hurting masculinity
[1:12:37] if Dad does it he's drawing masculinity
[1:12:39] because he's he's putting the household
[1:12:41] back in respect
[1:12:44] because now it's not about Mom it's
[1:12:46] about Dad
[1:12:48] and Dad's value for Mom and I won't
[1:12:50] cross that line
[1:12:55] why because this is God's picture that's
[1:12:58] why it works
[1:12:59] it works every time we must keep our
[1:13:02] homes in order
[1:13:04] we must we must operate the way God
[1:13:07] designed it for the benefit and those
[1:13:09] kids who grew up there hey you know what
[1:13:11] and that Dad better never talk to his
[1:13:13] daughter like that
[1:13:17] takes a different approach
[1:13:19] amen but if that father
[1:13:22] is If he if he honors his wife as the
[1:13:25] weaker vessel then he'll honor his
[1:13:26] daughter as a weaker vessel and he
[1:13:28] begins more tender with her and explains
[1:13:30] things the shelters and protects her and
[1:13:31] says don't worry Daddy will take care of
[1:13:33] it I'm watching over it you're going to
[1:13:35] train up a girl that is comfortable
[1:13:37] under male Authority
[1:13:40] if you're harsh and dominant and
[1:13:42] critical and you talk to her like you
[1:13:43] talk to another man you're going to have
[1:13:45] a woman that recoils from male Authority
[1:13:50] but if you handle or like you're
[1:13:51] supposed to handle your wife amen then
[1:13:53] all of a sudden she will grow up
[1:13:55] understanding male Authority and be
[1:13:56] comfortable under that and your men will
[1:13:58] be brought into a level of respect where
[1:14:00] they understand masculinity and they
[1:14:02] will be fathers in their homes
[1:14:04] you have fathers and mothers now working
[1:14:06] in harmony that's why I thank God for
[1:14:08] this message look at what it has done
[1:14:10] look around and look at what it has done
[1:14:11] for us
[1:14:13] the world's in absolute chaos and
[1:14:15] doesn't understand even where they're at
[1:14:17] they don't know what their gender is
[1:14:18] they don't know what the roles are they
[1:14:19] don't know who's allowed to do what amen
[1:14:21] look around and see Godly men Godly
[1:14:24] fathers Godly mothers boys who are
[1:14:26] acting like boys and girls who act like
[1:14:28] little ladies how is that happening it's
[1:14:31] happening because the word has been put
[1:14:32] in position the word is the headship the
[1:14:35] word is the male and we as a bride have
[1:14:37] come under that headship and lined up
[1:14:39] and respected the word
[1:14:42] and the word is put dad in place in the
[1:14:44] words put Mom in place and the word is
[1:14:46] put the house in place and the word is
[1:14:48] put the church in place
[1:14:51] amen it's not magic amen it's not a
[1:14:53] certain personality it's not any of this
[1:14:55] what's happening is the word amen is put
[1:14:58] in respect and honor and puts everything
[1:15:00] in order
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:08] women thrive on love men thrive on
[1:15:10] respect and honor
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] goddess
[1:15:16] super good
[1:15:18] sometimes I just don't know where to go
[1:15:20] I'm not where I plan to be and I don't
[1:15:22] know where to go
[1:15:24] let's look at let's look at Second Kings
[1:15:45] second Kings chapter 2 verse 23.
[1:15:57] second Kings chapter 2 verse 23.
[1:16:01] this is when we get down to verse or the
[1:16:05] first part of chapter two is when
[1:16:06] Elijah's caught up in a whirlwind of
[1:16:08] fire the mantle falls on Elisha Elisha
[1:16:11] begins to move out into his ministry
[1:16:14] in verse 23 it says and he went up from
[1:16:17] thence unto Bethel
[1:16:19] and as he was going up by that way there
[1:16:22] came forth little children out of the
[1:16:23] city and mocked him and said unto him go
[1:16:26] up thou bald head go up thou bald head
[1:16:28] and he turned back and looked on them
[1:16:30] and cursed them in the name of the Lord
[1:16:32] and there came forth two she Bears out
[1:16:34] of the wood and tear 40 and two children
[1:16:36] to them
[1:16:37] brother man refers to the story many
[1:16:39] times
[1:16:41] and he talks about how Elisha was an
[1:16:43] angered prophet he said that wasn't the
[1:16:45] spirit of Christ that wasn't the holy
[1:16:47] ghost that was an anchored prophet and
[1:16:49] that was a mistake he shouldn't have
[1:16:50] done that
[1:16:52] Elisha was wrong because he let the
[1:16:54] little children who were mocking him
[1:16:56] anger him and in his anger he cursed
[1:16:59] them and that was not the spirit of
[1:17:00] Christ that was himself that was wrong
[1:17:02] and we know that brother Branham faced a
[1:17:04] similar test when the couple was being
[1:17:05] irreverent in the front seat and he was
[1:17:07] told they're in your hands whatever you
[1:17:09] say and he said I forgive you
[1:17:11] he passed the test
[1:17:14] but both tests had to do with
[1:17:16] irreverence
[1:17:17] and it's amazing when brother man in one
[1:17:19] quote many times he just says that's not
[1:17:22] the holy ghost that wasn't Christ but
[1:17:24] here he says in Elisha the prophet from
[1:17:26] 1956 he says now remember he had a
[1:17:29] temper too and some children begin to
[1:17:31] make fun of him because he was
[1:17:32] bald-headed and he cursed those children
[1:17:35] and that wasn't so much for the
[1:17:37] children's sake it was for the parents
[1:17:38] that didn't raise up their children to
[1:17:40] respect God
[1:17:44] that's what it was the parents lost
[1:17:47] their children because two she Bears
[1:17:49] killed 42 of them
[1:17:53] he goes on a little later he said but do
[1:17:55] you see something it was the people's
[1:17:57] attitude towards God's messenger
[1:18:04] brother Brown says Elisha was wrong
[1:18:05] Elisha was wrong there's no way around
[1:18:07] it he was wrong
[1:18:09] but he says the reason the parents lost
[1:18:12] their children
[1:18:13] is because they disrespected God's
[1:18:15] prophet
[1:18:20] when they disrespected and Dishonored
[1:18:22] The Prophet they disrespected God
[1:18:25] and they so disrespect unto God's
[1:18:28] servant Into the Heart of their children
[1:18:30] and it brought a curse and it brought
[1:18:33] death
[1:18:34] I can tell you the same thing will
[1:18:35] happen today
[1:18:38] it may not be she bears
[1:18:40] amen but we don't disrespect God we
[1:18:43] don't disrespect God's way we don't
[1:18:45] disrespect God's prophet
[1:18:48] I want to look at a few scriptures
[1:18:49] together let's go to Psalms 111. I want
[1:18:52] to lay out a little pattern here
[1:19:00] Psalms 111
[1:19:08] .
[1:19:17] 11 and 10.
[1:19:20] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:19:23] wisdom and good understanding have all
[1:19:26] they that do his Commandments his praise
[1:19:28] endureth forever
[1:19:31] this word fear can be to be afraid of
[1:19:34] Terror are also deep reverence
[1:19:37] respect
[1:19:39] and the reverence and fear of God is the
[1:19:41] beginning of wisdom
[1:19:44] God
[1:19:45] in modern culture God is preached as
[1:19:48] though he's a woman
[1:19:50] and though he's always loved you and
[1:19:52] always come to Mama and he overlooks
[1:19:54] everything you do and
[1:19:57] but God has to be respected
[1:20:00] he's also a judge
[1:20:01] and he brings chastisement he's also a
[1:20:03] father
[1:20:05] so we have to be careful that we don't
[1:20:07] lean so one way on the aspect of God
[1:20:09] that we forget that God is a righteous
[1:20:11] God and he's to be respected in fact God
[1:20:14] demands respect
[1:20:17] he's not wishy-washy about it he demands
[1:20:19] respect
[1:20:21] uh let's go to Psalms 103 let's go back
[1:20:23] just a couple chapters here Psalms 103.
[1:20:28] verse 8.
[1:20:34] verse 8 the Lord is merciful and
[1:20:36] gracious slow to anger and plenteous and
[1:20:38] mercy he will not always chide neither
[1:20:40] will he keep his anger forever
[1:20:43] he has not dealt with us after our sins
[1:20:46] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:20:47] iniquities for as the heaven is high
[1:20:49] above the Earth is great his Mercy is
[1:20:52] towards them that fear Him now I want to
[1:20:54] lock in on that statement that fear Him
[1:20:57] because he says the Lord is merciful
[1:21:00] gracious slow to anger plenteous and
[1:21:03] mercy
[1:21:04] he won't always tide neither would keep
[1:21:06] anger forever
[1:21:08] he will not deal with us after our sins
[1:21:10] the reward us according to our
[1:21:11] iniquities I mean this is great God will
[1:21:13] forgive us God overlook God will have
[1:21:15] mercy but look at the requirements he
[1:21:18] says so the great is his Mercy toward
[1:21:21] them that fear Him
[1:21:23] great is his Mercy towards them that
[1:21:25] respect him honor and deeply reference
[1:21:27] him
[1:21:28] that's who he shows Mercy to
[1:21:33] verse 12 as far as the East is from the
[1:21:35] West so far hath he removed our
[1:21:37] transgression from us like as a father
[1:21:39] pitieth his children so the Lord pityth
[1:21:41] them that fear Him
[1:21:44] who's immersive for the ones that fear
[1:21:46] Him who does he pityth the ones that
[1:21:48] fear Him
[1:21:50] that respect him
[1:21:52] for he knoweth our frame he remembers
[1:21:54] that we are dust
[1:21:56] so he knows we're going to make mistakes
[1:21:57] he knows we're going to fail he knows he
[1:22:00] knows what happened in the Garden of
[1:22:01] Eden and he knows what's what situation
[1:22:03] we're stuck with in our flesh so he's
[1:22:05] merciful and piteous who those that
[1:22:07] respect him if you respect and honor God
[1:22:09] his mercies are new every morning he
[1:22:11] pityth you as a father pityth his
[1:22:13] children amen who be why because he
[1:22:15] knows that you're but dust
[1:22:19] but what if you're not fearing the Lord
[1:22:23] he goes on and he says
[1:22:26] verse 14 again for he knoweth our frame
[1:22:28] he remembered that we are dust as for
[1:22:31] man his days are his grass as a flower
[1:22:33] of the field so he flourishes for the
[1:22:35] wind passes over and it is gone and the
[1:22:37] place thereof shall know shall know it
[1:22:39] no more but the mercy of the Lord is
[1:22:41] from Everlasting to Everlasting upon
[1:22:44] them that fear Him
[1:22:46] and his righteousness unto his
[1:22:48] children's children to such as keep his
[1:22:51] Covenant and to those that remember his
[1:22:53] Commandments to do them
[1:22:56] who gets this Mercy who gets this un
[1:23:01] unstopping undenying mercy and Grace and
[1:23:04] love who gets this the ones that respect
[1:23:06] and honor him as a father and keep his
[1:23:09] Covenant and look after his Commandments
[1:23:10] they're the ones who receive these
[1:23:12] benefits
[1:23:14] when we preach it is this you can do
[1:23:16] whatever you want but God loves you and
[1:23:18] God overlooks it and Jesus died for all
[1:23:20] of your mistakes those statements are
[1:23:22] true they're true in a way
[1:23:25] but in a way they're false
[1:23:29] they're true in a way absolutely for the
[1:23:31] elect of God and for the children of God
[1:23:33] God is merciful god knows you're but
[1:23:36] dust he is tender in his Mercy he
[1:23:37] overlooks your iniquity he pityth you to
[1:23:40] those that fear him there must be a
[1:23:43] reverential fear of respect towards God
[1:23:45] into his word
[1:23:47] and then all of these benefits come it's
[1:23:50] not just like you can live laodicean and
[1:23:52] be anything that you want to be come to
[1:23:54] church and sing a nice song that says I
[1:23:56] love you I love you and then God
[1:23:57] overlooks all the sin in our lives and
[1:23:59] the the deformity of humanity and how
[1:24:03] Grievous the our actions are
[1:24:05] and I know chastisement will come and no
[1:24:08] correction my goodness we've got a
[1:24:10] complete perverted image of who God is
[1:24:17] in Proverbs chapter 1
[1:24:19] . let's go over to Proverbs we're going
[1:24:20] to read a few scriptures back to back
[1:24:21] here Proverbs chapter 1.
[1:24:25] verse 7.
[1:24:29] Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7 the fear of
[1:24:31] the Lord is the beginning of knowledge
[1:24:33] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[1:24:37] chapter 14 proverbs 14.
[1:24:42] and 27.
[1:24:45] the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of
[1:24:46] Life to depart from it to depart from
[1:24:49] the snares of death so the fear of the
[1:24:51] Lord is not just wisdom and not just
[1:24:53] knowledge it is a Fountain of Life
[1:24:57] to reverence God and fear Him and
[1:24:59] respect him is a fountain of life
[1:25:01] because it keeps you subject to his word
[1:25:05] and that brings you into life
[1:25:09] chapter 15 verse 33.
[1:25:14] the fear of the Lord is is the
[1:25:16] instruction of wisdom and before honor
[1:25:19] is humility
[1:25:21] let's go to John 14.
[1:25:32] John 14.
[1:25:34] verse 15.
[1:25:42] Jesus looks at his disciples and says if
[1:25:44] you love me
[1:25:45] sing a nice song in church
[1:25:53] you love me
[1:25:55] reverence me
[1:25:57] respect and honor me
[1:26:00] a man can say the same thing in his
[1:26:02] family
[1:26:04] you can bake me pies every day but if
[1:26:07] you disrespect and dishonor me it's not
[1:26:10] love amen to a man it's not love
[1:26:14] you can say nice things about me but if
[1:26:16] every time I say this is what we need to
[1:26:18] do and you do the opposite that's not
[1:26:20] love
[1:26:21] amen it doesn't come across his love it
[1:26:22] doesn't feel like love to a man you can
[1:26:24] say nice things you can make a good
[1:26:25] dinner but if you don't reference and
[1:26:28] respect it's not love
[1:26:31] and Jesus says if you love me
[1:26:34] keep my Commandments
[1:26:36] if you love me respect me if you love me
[1:26:39] honor me if you love me fear me
[1:26:44] amen
[1:26:48] and like I said before God demands
[1:26:51] respect
[1:26:54] I mean this world is an absolute
[1:26:56] disrespect of God
[1:26:58] but is God going to do nothing about it
[1:27:00] no he's given him space to repent
[1:27:02] and the long sufferings of the Lord are
[1:27:04] for salvation to those who will turn he
[1:27:06] sent a prophet to declare but that
[1:27:09] Prophet didn't just declare the goodness
[1:27:11] of God he also began the judgments of
[1:27:13] the Earth
[1:27:14] because God will chase in this world for
[1:27:17] their sin he will burn it with fire he
[1:27:19] will Stone them with stones
[1:27:24] as he demands respect
[1:27:28] let's look at First Corinthians 11.
[1:27:36] First Corinthians 11.
[1:27:38] and 31.
[1:27:44] First Corinthians 11 and 31.
[1:27:48] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:27:50] should not be judged but when we are
[1:27:52] judged we are chastened to the Lord that
[1:27:54] we should not be condemned with the
[1:27:56] world
[1:27:58] if we fail to judge ourselves guess what
[1:28:01] he'll judge us
[1:28:03] not look over it
[1:28:05] not act like it didn't happen not that
[1:28:07] you're going on or but he'll chasten you
[1:28:10] chasing is a spanking amen a correction
[1:28:13] he will correct you why so that you
[1:28:15] won't be condemned with the world you're
[1:28:16] his child he'll take care of you it's
[1:28:18] for your good but he's not just going to
[1:28:20] pass it off and let it go God has to
[1:28:23] restore respect in his own household
[1:28:28] that's what he was doing through a
[1:28:29] prophet he was restoring respect in his
[1:28:31] own household
[1:28:33] the church had got out of respects of
[1:28:35] God got off of the word amen and no
[1:28:37] longer made the the word the head and
[1:28:38] made the church the head
[1:28:40] made a committee of men deciding factors
[1:28:42] over the word and God sends a prophet
[1:28:45] along and that Prophet is a man's man
[1:28:47] and what's he doing he's calling it all
[1:28:49] wrong and he's pointing out amen the
[1:28:50] error of the church and the fallacy of
[1:28:53] men and he's bringing God's house back
[1:28:55] in respect
[1:28:59] amen and it's a good thing
[1:29:02] so as some of that was rough it needed
[1:29:04] to be rough it was a chastening
[1:29:07] a chastening
[1:29:09] is not supposed to feel good
[1:29:11] I don't I mean
[1:29:14] I gave him a spank and he was laughing
[1:29:16] the whole time said it tickle thank you
[1:29:18] Mommy
[1:29:19] no it's supposed to be a shaking amen
[1:29:22] get us back in position get us out of
[1:29:24] our position and bring us back into
[1:29:25] respect for God and this message brought
[1:29:28] the church back in respects to God
[1:29:31] because God demands respect and he says
[1:29:34] if you love me keep my Commandments
[1:29:37] you'll see people who will transgress
[1:29:39] the Commandments of God and pay no more
[1:29:41] attention to the word of God Amen pay no
[1:29:44] more attention to what Paul wrote than
[1:29:45] anybody they'll change it they'll say it
[1:29:47] doesn't matter amen the churches of the
[1:29:49] world Amen they'll Overlook all of that
[1:29:51] and say you just come and you love God
[1:29:53] God loves you that's all you need and
[1:29:54] they come and sing a love song to God
[1:29:57] hmm
[1:29:58] and go home thinking that God received
[1:30:01] their love
[1:30:03] he said if you love me keep my
[1:30:04] Commandments
[1:30:13] sometimes the judgments of God are harsh
[1:30:16] harsh
[1:30:19] sometimes the spankings are hard
[1:30:23] look at what he did to the nation of
[1:30:24] Israel and to Judah
[1:30:26] first he promised I'm bringing you into
[1:30:28] a land I'm giving this land for you and
[1:30:30] your Generations forever I have given
[1:30:31] this inherent I'll drive out the
[1:30:33] inhabitants I'll do this and I'll do
[1:30:35] that he tells David there'll not be one
[1:30:37] to cease from your lineage to sit upon
[1:30:40] your throne amen and so he he gives all
[1:30:43] these promises but what did Jude and
[1:30:45] Israel do they relaxed under the promise
[1:30:47] of God
[1:30:49] and they begin to lose respect for God
[1:30:53] and they begin to transgress his
[1:30:55] Commandments they begin to trample upon
[1:30:57] his word they begin to ignore his
[1:30:59] worship and ignore his Temple until many
[1:31:01] times the temple would fall into ruin
[1:31:03] amen disrepair amen the priests would
[1:31:05] start mixing the religion of Baal in
[1:31:07] with the religion of Jehovah doing
[1:31:09] things that they were absolutely
[1:31:10] commanded not to do amen they were under
[1:31:13] the promise of God and they felt content
[1:31:15] we're the children of God he brought us
[1:31:17] out of Egypt he told us he gave us his
[1:31:19] land he'll drive out the inhabitants
[1:31:21] he'll be a wall around us and we're here
[1:31:22] to be perpetually for Generations this
[1:31:25] is always our land and there'll always
[1:31:27] be a king on the throne of David
[1:31:30] and they forgot back in Deuteronomy he
[1:31:34] said if they will keep my ways
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:42] the modern churches amen are preaching
[1:31:46] the blessing
[1:31:48] but bringing people into disrespect of
[1:31:50] God
[1:31:54] but the message snapped us out of that
[1:31:58] and I want to say stay snapped out
[1:32:02] see the church is the woman
[1:32:05] is the mother time
[1:32:06] and the word is the husband is Christ
[1:32:09] is the man
[1:32:12] and so in order for the whole household
[1:32:15] to be right amen the woman must and her
[1:32:19] children must come subject to the
[1:32:21] headship of the word
[1:32:23] and must reverence the word because
[1:32:25] Jesus says if you love me keep my
[1:32:27] Commandments
[1:32:28] so now in order for the church to be
[1:32:31] right and the children to be blessed and
[1:32:33] for everything to go well
[1:32:35] the word has to stay headship as the
[1:32:38] masculine and the church listen the
[1:32:41] church is supposed to be nurturing
[1:32:43] they're feminine in designation the
[1:32:46] church should be nurturing the church
[1:32:47] should be gentle the church should be
[1:32:48] loving the church should be the one that
[1:32:50] gathers around in a wounded time they
[1:32:52] gather to help they gather to support
[1:32:54] that's the church
[1:32:55] and that's a good function for the
[1:32:57] church but the problem is that coddling
[1:33:00] nurturing spirit amen in the church now
[1:33:03] when things begin to go wrong and now
[1:33:05] someone's off the word amen if there's
[1:33:07] too much of that feminine nature not
[1:33:09] checked by the masculine then the church
[1:33:12] now begins to say I I know that Paul
[1:33:16] said
[1:33:17] but
[1:33:22] I I know the Bible says but but listen
[1:33:25] there's more you need to understand and
[1:33:27] our church fathers and our elders and we
[1:33:29] as a church we we interpret it this way
[1:33:31] and yeah you can get married again I
[1:33:33] understand you didn't mean it
[1:33:37] I know that you don't quite meet the
[1:33:40] qualifications but you can take this
[1:33:41] office or this position I mean because
[1:33:43] we see you love him we love you so much
[1:33:44] and we see you're really trying
[1:33:49] you see how the woman can fail
[1:33:52] and what she is what the the church has
[1:33:55] done in her love
[1:33:57] has brought a curse upon the very
[1:34:01] children she claims to love
[1:34:04] just as much as those children and those
[1:34:07] children in Samaria were cursed because
[1:34:08] of what their parents their parents
[1:34:10] disrespect for the prophet amen LED down
[1:34:13] to their disrespect that brought them
[1:34:14] under a curse and Damnation the church
[1:34:16] has done the same thing when by love and
[1:34:19] so much tenderness and love and
[1:34:21] affection and nurturing and coddling
[1:34:23] amen until all of a sudden they'll
[1:34:25] Overlook sin
[1:34:29] and say that's okay you stay right here
[1:34:32] we understand you didn't mean to I know
[1:34:35] you didn't mean it and God understands
[1:34:41] yeah God understands
[1:34:43] that's the truth God understands
[1:34:46] he knows when he's being disrespected
[1:34:49] he knows when the woman is usurping
[1:34:51] authority over the man and now for that
[1:34:54] nature listen we don't want the church
[1:34:56] to become rough and we don't if the
[1:34:59] whole church became an evangelist I
[1:35:01] would find a new church
[1:35:03] we want the church to be gentle we want
[1:35:05] to gather around the Saints we want to
[1:35:07] be nurturing but what gives the freedom
[1:35:09] for the woman to take her role is that
[1:35:11] there's a male standing at the gate
[1:35:13] saying we will and we won't we will and
[1:35:14] we won't setting the boundaries keeping
[1:35:16] things in check so that the woman has
[1:35:18] the freedom to express the feminine
[1:35:20] nature so that the church can be
[1:35:23] nurturing the church can be calling the
[1:35:24] church can gather around in times of
[1:35:26] discomfort and Times of distress amen
[1:35:28] but but that church can never begin to
[1:35:31] take the children's heart away from the
[1:35:33] authority of the word
[1:35:36] that's where the church fails and that's
[1:35:38] where it brings a curse upon the very
[1:35:40] children that's supposed to be loved
[1:35:45] same thing's true in the home
[1:35:47] if a mother if a father lays down a rule
[1:35:50] amen but when father's at work and
[1:35:52] mother says now listen I know Dad said
[1:35:55] but
[1:35:56] but I know I know really what you want I
[1:36:00] know it's okay let's just do this and
[1:36:02] not say anything to Dad
[1:36:05] I know dad doesn't want this but it's
[1:36:08] okay this time
[1:36:12] you have no idea what damage
[1:36:15] is being done to that child
[1:36:19] that's what's wrong with the entire
[1:36:21] country
[1:36:23] because the church has started that
[1:36:25] attitude
[1:36:27] spilled into the culture
[1:36:29] and now the world is in chaos
[1:36:35] yeah well I mean it was only about
[1:36:37] whether they can ride their bike on the
[1:36:39] road or not or whether they can eat ice
[1:36:40] cream no listen it's not about that
[1:36:44] it's about training those children to
[1:36:46] give reverence
[1:36:48] to the masculine spirit
[1:36:50] because if you teach them to disrespect
[1:36:52] their dad it will be nothing for them to
[1:36:54] disrespect God's word
[1:36:57] it'll be so easy that's what's happened
[1:37:00] to our culture
[1:37:02] men used to be respected men used to be
[1:37:05] authorities men used to have power to
[1:37:07] rule their own house
[1:37:09] and when that got Stripped Away
[1:37:12] why because of the church
[1:37:14] when that got Stripped Away we see the
[1:37:16] chaos we're in now amen what a mother
[1:37:20] needs to do is constantly uphold the
[1:37:22] authority of that father
[1:37:24] she needs to tell the children let's ask
[1:37:27] Dad
[1:37:28] no dad said dad said no we shouldn't do
[1:37:31] that
[1:37:33] dad said yes this is okay what's she
[1:37:35] doing she's training her children to
[1:37:38] come under the authority of the
[1:37:39] masculine spirit amen
[1:37:42] healthy
[1:37:44] it's good the opposite is damaging
[1:37:48] very damaging and it may seem like love
[1:37:51] but it's not love because now you're
[1:37:53] setting up a struggle within your
[1:37:55] children when you just want them to
[1:37:57] respect does that means every one of
[1:37:58] dad's decisions is right no
[1:38:01] it does not mean that dad's decisions
[1:38:02] are right but Dad has the right to make
[1:38:05] a wrong decision
[1:38:09] and I'm sorry if that rubs somebody the
[1:38:11] wrong way but it's absolutely the way it
[1:38:13] has to be dad has the right to make the
[1:38:16] wrong decision but Dad must bear the
[1:38:18] consequences for that wrong decision
[1:38:21] he's got to take responsibility if he's
[1:38:23] going to take the privilege he's going
[1:38:24] to take the responsibility as well
[1:38:27] but he's the one with the right and you
[1:38:29] say but it's wrong but I feel it's this
[1:38:31] you and listen you've got a right to ask
[1:38:33] him about it
[1:38:34] you've got a right to have a
[1:38:35] conversation but don't you do it in
[1:38:37] front of your children
[1:38:40] don't you question his authority don't
[1:38:42] you question his decisions don't you
[1:38:44] question his soundness
[1:38:46] and making decisions in front of his
[1:38:48] children if you do you're setting up
[1:38:50] trouble
[1:38:51] amen because why he has the right as the
[1:38:56] man as the father as the husband to set
[1:38:58] the rules to set everything he has the
[1:39:00] right
[1:39:01] yes and and if we take away that right
[1:39:04] it brings a danger to the whole family
[1:39:09] it's like taking a wall that God built
[1:39:11] for protection and start just
[1:39:12] willy-nilly knocking holes in it
[1:39:14] anywhere that you want to knock holes in
[1:39:15] now there's no more protection
[1:39:18] but when we begin to do that we get out
[1:39:20] of our lane we begin to hinder the whole
[1:39:22] work and actually the the very the very
[1:39:26] mother who will take a tender heart and
[1:39:28] do those things is actually going to do
[1:39:30] more damage than good to her children
[1:39:32] because she wanted to give the popsicle
[1:39:34] or let him ride the bike or whatever it
[1:39:35] was she thinks it's nothing but she
[1:39:37] doesn't realize that if you continue to
[1:39:39] do that and continue to be little that
[1:39:41] and continue to make dad look like he
[1:39:42] doesn't know doesn't understand doesn't
[1:39:44] have a big enough heart then what you're
[1:39:46] going to do is destroy that child
[1:39:49] because now they're thinking dad doesn't
[1:39:51] make good decisions mom does
[1:39:54] dad doesn't understand Mom does
[1:39:57] that doesn't feel for me mom does
[1:40:04] ruining the very thing that God put in
[1:40:07] place to protect the family
[1:40:10] oh listen like I said is Dad right every
[1:40:13] time absolutely not
[1:40:15] doesn't mean his idea is better than
[1:40:17] moms absolutely not sometimes moms is
[1:40:19] way better than dads
[1:40:21] but you better wait and ask him
[1:40:24] privately about that
[1:40:27] and let him come back around and say you
[1:40:30] know what I had the wrong idea I talked
[1:40:32] to Mom and she gave me this is a better
[1:40:34] idea we're going to switch that so the
[1:40:35] man is always in his position
[1:40:39] he doesn't have to claim to know
[1:40:40] everything he can claim to be a
[1:40:41] knucklehead sometimes say listen guys
[1:40:42] that was a knucklehead move I should
[1:40:44] have never done that I talked to your
[1:40:46] mom and I realized that there was
[1:40:47] something else going on here I missed it
[1:40:49] I'm sorry we're going to switch to this
[1:40:51] but he has to do it
[1:40:54] he has to do it to keep everything in
[1:40:57] this right place
[1:40:59] not her coming and saying now you're
[1:41:02] sitting at the dinner table
[1:41:04] and all of a sudden dad says we're not
[1:41:06] going to do but you told him two days
[1:41:08] ago they couldn't I don't think that's
[1:41:09] fair and I agree with the kids
[1:41:15] you're tearing down your own house
[1:41:18] you're destroying your own children
[1:41:23] now you can talk to him privately and
[1:41:25] tell him I think that's a foolish
[1:41:26] mistake I don't think that's right
[1:41:27] whatever you say goes but I think you're
[1:41:29] missing something that's fine
[1:41:31] but don't do it in front of those kids
[1:41:34] don't don't go and undermine the the
[1:41:38] faith they have in the masculine Spirit
[1:41:40] and the ability for that man to rule his
[1:41:42] house don't do that
[1:41:44] you'll regret it
[1:41:46] the whole family will suffer
[1:41:48] what's happened the church has done that
[1:41:50] very same thing
[1:41:52] they've come along and say Paul wasn't
[1:41:55] married he doesn't understand and Paul's
[1:41:57] too hard on women
[1:42:00] do you know what that statement does
[1:42:04] Paul the whole statement Paul was too
[1:42:06] hard on women he didn't understand and
[1:42:08] Paul was never married so Paul really he
[1:42:11] shouldn't have said that and
[1:42:12] do you know what you have just done to a
[1:42:14] whole group of people that you you've
[1:42:16] poisoned with that garbage
[1:42:20] you know we can do the same thing in the
[1:42:22] message when brother Branham teaches
[1:42:23] marriage and divorce and we go around
[1:42:25] and say he didn't mean it that way we
[1:42:27] can do it this way you've done the same
[1:42:28] exact thing
[1:42:31] we've done the same thing amen why
[1:42:34] because God put us under the headship of
[1:42:36] a messenger in this day and we must
[1:42:37] honor that Prophet we honor the prophet
[1:42:39] we reverence God
[1:42:40] because he's the one who sent the
[1:42:41] prophet he's the one who Vindicated the
[1:42:43] prophet he's the one who gave the
[1:42:44] prophet what to preach
[1:42:47] and bringing us back into respect of God
[1:42:52] amen
[1:42:55] amen what's happened in our culture in
[1:42:57] our society is men have been publicly
[1:43:00] derided
[1:43:02] they've been chastised by their wives
[1:43:04] they've been shamed
[1:43:06] and you know what men have an ego
[1:43:09] it's not right but it's there
[1:43:12] I admit to it
[1:43:14] a man's problem is his ego
[1:43:17] and that's what trip up a man every time
[1:43:20] but you go publicly
[1:43:22] you start challenging his authority you
[1:43:25] start making him look like a fool or
[1:43:27] insensitive or not knowing better in
[1:43:29] front of his children in front of his
[1:43:30] family that man that man many times if
[1:43:33] he doesn't have the right understanding
[1:43:34] Authority he'll go silent
[1:43:38] because he's not going to go through the
[1:43:39] pain of that again
[1:43:41] and now you've got a man who won't take
[1:43:43] his position but now he'll just defer
[1:43:46] everything to his wife why because he's
[1:43:48] a weak man well maybe maybe you should
[1:43:50] take his position but maybe because she
[1:43:52] destroyed his manhood
[1:43:54] when she should have been elevating it
[1:43:56] for her own protection
[1:44:00] we have to say God
[1:44:02] I want to live the way you want me
[1:44:05] I want my family to be structured the
[1:44:08] way your family is structured I want to
[1:44:10] recognize your ways and I want to live
[1:44:12] your ways
[1:44:14] amen
[1:44:16] the church has destroyed her own
[1:44:17] children
[1:44:19] by getting them to lose reverence for
[1:44:22] the word
[1:44:24] the best way that we can protect the
[1:44:26] people is to show them reverence to the
[1:44:28] word
[1:44:29] you respect God you reverence God when
[1:44:32] the word says this but don't you think
[1:44:34] yeah sometimes it's hard sometimes I
[1:44:36] don't understand my feeling is for you
[1:44:38] and I I don't want this to happen but
[1:44:40] the word says
[1:44:43] it doesn't mean you don't feel sometimes
[1:44:45] sometimes you don't even question
[1:44:46] sometimes you don't even understand amen
[1:44:48] but the word says amen that's the right
[1:44:51] Authority that's the right position and
[1:44:54] then the church comes under that
[1:44:56] that's the way we need to be
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:02] I'm going to skip ahead a little bit
[1:45:04] I want to go to First Chronicles 13.
[1:45:17] First Chronicles 13.
[1:45:30] First Chronicles 13.
[1:45:33] and 10.
[1:45:35] this is when David is bringing the ark
[1:45:37] to himself and they put the Ark on an ox
[1:45:39] cart and they begin to bring it to
[1:45:41] himself
[1:45:42] and it says here and the anger of the
[1:45:43] Lord was kindled against uzum and he
[1:45:45] smote him because he put his hand to the
[1:45:47] ark and there he died before God
[1:45:50] and David was displeased because the
[1:45:52] Lord had made a breach upon uza
[1:45:54] therefore that place is called
[1:45:57] to this day and David was afraid of God
[1:46:00] that day
[1:46:04] David was afraid of God
[1:46:07] that day
[1:46:09] This Modern teaching on God is that
[1:46:11] don't fear God don't be afraid of God
[1:46:15] but David was afraid of God that day
[1:46:18] and guess what David should have been
[1:46:20] afraid of God
[1:46:22] because David transgressed God's law and
[1:46:25] by his transgression God smote a man
[1:46:28] dead
[1:46:31] should he have been afraid of that yeah
[1:46:33] he should have been afraid of God
[1:46:33] because God demands respect
[1:46:38] he doesn't give up his vision he demands
[1:46:39] respect he may be long-suffering and
[1:46:41] bringing the chastisement he may let
[1:46:43] something go on to fully manifest
[1:46:45] himself like he let the the cup of the
[1:46:47] amorites become full before he brought
[1:46:49] destruction but God will not let it pass
[1:46:51] it may pass for a decade it may pass for
[1:46:53] a generation but God will not let it
[1:46:55] pass he demands respect
[1:46:58] and when he brought judgment on David on
[1:47:00] that situation A man was laying dead and
[1:47:02] David went to his house afraid of God
[1:47:03] and he should have been afraid of God
[1:47:06] just like you know when you have a
[1:47:08] little Todd at home and he's not
[1:47:09] listening not doing well and mother
[1:47:11] looks at him and says I'm I'm going to
[1:47:13] talk to Dad and when Dad gets home he's
[1:47:15] going to deal with that
[1:47:17] should that little boy girl be afraid of
[1:47:19] dad yes they should be afraid of dad not
[1:47:22] afraid that dad's going to be violent
[1:47:24] not afraid of their daddy that he's
[1:47:25] going to be a brood but they should have
[1:47:27] a good healthy reverential fear that
[1:47:30] what they did is going to meet with a
[1:47:31] judgment by a judge who's able to
[1:47:33] Institute the judgment
[1:47:36] and that fear of dad keeps that child in
[1:47:40] check amen so that he doesn't allow his
[1:47:43] own little Fallen Spirit to take him too
[1:47:45] far one way or the other
[1:47:48] David was afraid of God he should have
[1:47:51] been
[1:47:52] amen well I don't want to be afraid of
[1:47:55] God then you stay under his Commandments
[1:47:58] reverence him respect him in his mercies
[1:48:00] are new for you
[1:48:01] his rights is unto you is for
[1:48:03] Everlasting to Everlasting amen as long
[1:48:05] as you are in the fear of God you don't
[1:48:08] have to be afraid because God knows
[1:48:10] you're but dust and God will forgive you
[1:48:11] God will correct you and forgive you and
[1:48:13] his mercies are new every morning but if
[1:48:16] you are disrespecting God and you're
[1:48:18] afraid you ought to be afraid because
[1:48:20] the hand of chastisements coming
[1:48:23] and it needs to come because God has to
[1:48:25] restore respect in his house
[1:48:28] that's why a man has to stay in his
[1:48:31] position and bring correction and he
[1:48:32] must restore respect and reverence in
[1:48:34] his house it's his job to do it
[1:48:37] amen amen it may be hard you may be
[1:48:39] misunderstood but it's the very
[1:48:40] protection for everybody that's under
[1:48:42] your leadership
[1:48:43] you must stay true to your position
[1:48:47] brother Branham says one time
[1:48:49] said in the message God doesn't call man
[1:48:51] the Judgment without first warning him
[1:48:53] says I don't know what caused me to do
[1:48:55] it but I said Lord God you owe me an
[1:48:57] understanding
[1:48:59] this is when the woman he had prayed for
[1:49:01] she was healed he declared or healed
[1:49:03] amen and just shortly after I think the
[1:49:05] next day she died
[1:49:07] he said Lord you owe me an understanding
[1:49:09] see after we going out there and telling
[1:49:11] that husband and him coming to the Lord
[1:49:13] after you've done those things for him
[1:49:14] and all that life and then taking that
[1:49:16] girl's life like that I said you owe me
[1:49:19] an understanding
[1:49:22] when you tell God something like that
[1:49:24] he'll leave you sit alone
[1:49:28] brother bam goes on to say he don't owe
[1:49:31] me nothing I'm in debt to him
[1:49:34] well he just let me pout it out for a
[1:49:36] few days you know and after about three
[1:49:38] or four months
[1:49:40] brother but I'm saying that you know
[1:49:42] what God had a relationship with his
[1:49:44] Prophet where he's constantly in
[1:49:45] continual communion with the prophet
[1:49:47] amen but when he says God you owe me an
[1:49:49] explanation God said that's it I'm
[1:49:51] pulling away from this communion
[1:49:54] amen and brother Branham found out he
[1:49:57] couldn't control God
[1:50:03] didn't owe him nothing no matter who he
[1:50:05] was who was he the seventh angel the
[1:50:08] prophet of the age The Chosen before the
[1:50:09] foundation of the world
[1:50:12] who was he but God didn't know him
[1:50:14] nothing what was God doing God was
[1:50:16] bringing that Prophet back into proper
[1:50:18] respect
[1:50:19] you can't talk to God any way you want
[1:50:21] you can't make demands of God God can
[1:50:23] just pull away from you and if you want
[1:50:24] to do it on your own you do it on your
[1:50:26] own
[1:50:28] he let him pound it out for a few days
[1:50:30] then after about three or four months
[1:50:32] one day I was out on the creek bank and
[1:50:34] the Lord spoke to me in a vision and
[1:50:35] said now go to her mother and say this
[1:50:37] to her mother did not her time come the
[1:50:39] year before when she was drowning in the
[1:50:41] creek on a picnic she should have went
[1:50:43] at that time but I had to take her when
[1:50:45] she was ready to go and that's what all
[1:50:47] this has happened and why you went out
[1:50:49] there then I got down and I cried and I
[1:50:52] said Lord Jesus forgive me your poor
[1:50:54] stupid servant I should have never said
[1:50:56] that Lord
[1:50:58] amen
[1:51:00] I mean sometimes we talk about the
[1:51:03] goodness of God and the love of God and
[1:51:05] the good but we need to keep that in
[1:51:07] check with the Judgment of God and the
[1:51:08] chastisement of God and the reverence
[1:51:10] for God
[1:51:11] because God demands reverence
[1:51:14] amen you can't live any way you want and
[1:51:16] command him and demand him and say you
[1:51:18] have to forgive me you have to overlook
[1:51:20] this you have to bless me he doesn't
[1:51:22] have to do anything that he doesn't want
[1:51:24] to do
[1:51:26] and he's got the right to say yes and he
[1:51:28] has the right to say no
[1:51:30] and as long as we stay in that kind of
[1:51:32] reverence amen we're going to find
[1:51:34] ourselves in a good position because
[1:51:36] we're going to have a father God who is
[1:51:37] watching out for us and protecting us
[1:51:39] and nurturing us and caring for us and
[1:51:41] shielding us from all the storms of life
[1:51:45] that's right that's the proper respect
[1:51:47] we want
[1:51:49] brother Branham says it in the message
[1:51:51] and knoweth it not he says I'm not a
[1:51:53] politician I don't neither I don't
[1:51:55] neither democrat or republican they're
[1:51:57] all Filthy I'm for one Kingdom and
[1:51:59] that's the kingdom of Jesus Christ
[1:52:00] that's all
[1:52:01] but how in the world did you ever see a
[1:52:03] bunch of Puppets like we got up there
[1:52:05] now like that bunch of Texans we got in
[1:52:07] there
[1:52:12] he's a man
[1:52:14] he can say what he thinks praise God
[1:52:17] now listen
[1:52:19] he says why they say whatever the people
[1:52:21] want if they want communism we'll give
[1:52:23] them communism if they want integration
[1:52:25] we'll give them integration we want
[1:52:27] segregation we'll give them whatever
[1:52:30] where is a man this is what brother bear
[1:52:32] said where is a man
[1:52:34] the men sitting up there saying well if
[1:52:36] that's what the people want that's what
[1:52:37] we'll give them the politicians they
[1:52:39] want communism if they want segregation
[1:52:40] whatever they want we'll give them and
[1:52:42] brother banham says the statement where
[1:52:44] is man
[1:52:45] he says oh God that's like the pulpit
[1:52:48] where is a man a man that's a man that
[1:52:51] stands for a principle
[1:52:53] where is women that stands for a
[1:52:55] principle where is a church that stands
[1:52:56] for a principle I ain't got a nickel's
[1:52:58] worth of time for a wishy-washy given
[1:53:00] compromising spirit
[1:53:02] a woman is a woman let her be a lady if
[1:53:04] a man is a man let him be a man if he's
[1:53:07] president where is our John Quincy Adams
[1:53:09] is where are Abraham Lincoln's man of
[1:53:11] principle where is our Patrick Henry
[1:53:13] said Give me liberty or give me death
[1:53:15] where is a man that stands for what's
[1:53:17] right where is the man that's not afraid
[1:53:19] to speak out regardless the whole
[1:53:21] world's against him speak out for what's
[1:53:23] right and stand for it and die for it
[1:53:25] where is our Arnold Van Winkle Reed
[1:53:27] again today where is Men of Integrity
[1:53:30] where is men with Spirit they are so
[1:53:32] wishy-washy and gummed up until they
[1:53:34] don't know where they stand
[1:53:36] God let me stand with the principles of
[1:53:38] a man as a minister the word of Jesus
[1:53:40] Christ
[1:53:41] praise God
[1:53:43] for heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:53:45] it'll never fail on this rock I'll build
[1:53:47] my church The Gates of Hell shall not
[1:53:49] Prevail against him
[1:53:52] oh praise God I like a man who will talk
[1:53:54] like that
[1:53:55] I got an argument we'll point that out
[1:53:57] where's the man that'll stand for
[1:53:59] convictions where is man that'll take
[1:54:00] the hit where's man that's willing to
[1:54:02] say what's right and take the
[1:54:04] repercussions that come from it where is
[1:54:05] a man that will defend his family and
[1:54:07] stay in position and say we won't
[1:54:09] because the word says even if his own
[1:54:11] family misunderstands him where's the
[1:54:13] man that's willing to do what's best for
[1:54:15] them
[1:54:16] not what's easiest for himself
[1:54:19] where is the man willing to get shot at
[1:54:21] rocks thrown at him Amen to do what is
[1:54:24] right that's man
[1:54:27] doesn't matter if he's loud or if he's
[1:54:29] soft-spoken
[1:54:30] doesn't matter if he's got hair all over
[1:54:33] him or he's smooth skinned
[1:54:35] you see that's not what man is man is
[1:54:37] the character to stay in his position
[1:54:39] and say I have a responsibility to take
[1:54:42] care of these that are under me
[1:54:44] and in order to do that I can't always
[1:54:46] be popular and I can't always be smooth
[1:54:48] and I can't always be sweet
[1:54:50] but this is love
[1:54:53] This Is Love from a masculine nature
[1:54:59] brother remember says and the message
[1:55:01] have not I seen Cynthia so sometimes I
[1:55:04] preach pretty rough
[1:55:06] because see that because somebody's
[1:55:09] getting out of line
[1:55:10] you see you're supposed to do that
[1:55:13] a real daddy will
[1:55:16] why he'd shake you and say here get back
[1:55:18] here in line if he's a real true father
[1:55:20] so sometimes your pastor has to weigh
[1:55:22] down on something just love him that
[1:55:24] much more because he's a real father to
[1:55:25] you see trying to keep you lined up
[1:55:28] because he's watching over your soul
[1:55:29] which the Holy Ghost has made him the
[1:55:31] overseer of the church and you must
[1:55:32] always watch that
[1:55:34] so brother Branham said sometimes I
[1:55:36] preach pretty rough because somebody's
[1:55:39] getting out of line he says you're
[1:55:40] supposed to do that
[1:55:42] this world's been so feminized that
[1:55:44] we're not allowed to speak rough anymore
[1:55:46] and speaking rough somehow is mean since
[1:55:48] when is talking like a man mean
[1:55:54] but I mean the whole culture has got to
[1:55:57] a certain way that we all recoil at that
[1:56:01] but my goodness listen to a few tapes
[1:56:06] listen to the message and listen to who
[1:56:08] God chose Amen to be the messenger's age
[1:56:11] to take the masculine side to dispense
[1:56:13] the word why because when The Minister's
[1:56:16] ministering he's taking the masculine
[1:56:17] role because he's giving out the word
[1:56:20] amen so there's a masculine row and a
[1:56:23] feminine role to receive the word and
[1:56:25] brother Branham came in a masculine role
[1:56:27] amen he was also part of the Bride
[1:56:29] that's feminine but when he was
[1:56:30] delivering the word as the prophet of
[1:56:32] the age he took on a masculine role
[1:56:36] and he says sometimes you shake people
[1:56:37] you need to do that amen sometimes a man
[1:56:40] needs to shake his house shake his
[1:56:41] children sometimes he needs to bring
[1:56:43] correction sometimes it needs to come
[1:56:44] from the pulpit amen we don't need to
[1:56:46] turn into the culture whenever that
[1:56:48] happens we need to sit down and say God
[1:56:50] what are you trying to teach me
[1:56:52] not he's not allowed to talk that way
[1:56:56] well forget about the way he's talking
[1:56:58] what's he saying
[1:57:03] he said the culture sometimes can creep
[1:57:05] in the churches creep into message
[1:57:07] churches where it's surrounded we have
[1:57:09] to push it out
[1:57:11] we have to constantly resist it it's in
[1:57:13] our workplace it's in our schools it's
[1:57:15] all around us
[1:57:17] we've got to constantly put that out or
[1:57:19] else every time you hear Brother Bear
[1:57:20] say something on tape you're like oh I
[1:57:22] wish he wouldn't have said that that way
[1:57:25] I want to give this tape to my friend
[1:57:29] maybe what your friend needs is to hear
[1:57:31] a masculine voice tell the truth
[1:57:34] something different than what they're
[1:57:35] hearing all the time
[1:57:37] amen
[1:57:39] one of the first tapes I listened to is
[1:57:41] marriage and divorce
[1:57:42] you want to talk about rough
[1:57:44] there were some rough statements in
[1:57:46] marriage and divorce and it was in the
[1:57:47] first block of tapes that I listened to
[1:57:49] but my goodness something inside of me
[1:57:51] came alive when a man was a man and said
[1:57:54] what was true and something in me knew
[1:57:55] that he was right
[1:57:57] I didn't I mean I thought it was a
[1:57:59] little hard there was times I was like
[1:58:00] oh that's too far that's too much but my
[1:58:03] goodness he was drawing something out of
[1:58:04] me
[1:58:05] pulling me back into respect to God
[1:58:10] you know we got to be careful as
[1:58:11] brothers and sisters too how we talk
[1:58:14] about the ministry of God
[1:58:16] because we can do the same thing in a
[1:58:18] church that a mother can do in her home
[1:58:22] amen is a preacher always right no is
[1:58:24] everything he says right is the fivefold
[1:58:26] ministry and foundable absolutely not
[1:58:29] but if you go home and start criticizing
[1:58:32] that Minister and he said
[1:58:34] he's standing there in a male role
[1:58:37] dispensing the word and what you're
[1:58:39] sowing into the heart of your children
[1:58:41] is wrong
[1:58:44] now there may be mistakes made in the
[1:58:46] Pulpit there has been and there will be
[1:58:49] but that's when you can do like Mom does
[1:58:52] Dad you go to that man and you say
[1:58:53] listen I didn't understand what you said
[1:58:55] it seemed a little bit that the man
[1:58:57] correct it and let the man come back and
[1:58:58] say I shouldn't have done that
[1:59:00] but don't you dare go amongst yourself
[1:59:02] start saying do you think that was right
[1:59:03] do you think this we think he should
[1:59:04] have done that I didn't like the way
[1:59:06] what seed is being sown what damage is
[1:59:10] being done amen you can ruin a man's
[1:59:13] influence and ruin his ministry and that
[1:59:14] may be the ministry that God will use to
[1:59:16] save your child
[1:59:20] summer rougher summer softer summer are
[1:59:23] bold some are all over the place some
[1:59:25] stand at the platform amen don't worry
[1:59:27] about your favorite style and don't
[1:59:29] criticize everything that's not your
[1:59:30] favorite Style Just Hold Steady and let
[1:59:32] go and if there's something wrong let's
[1:59:34] make it right let's have a conversation
[1:59:35] but don't sow evil seeds
[1:59:39] seeds of discrepancy seeds that cost
[1:59:41] somebody to maybe doubt in their mind
[1:59:42] and the next time that man's preaching
[1:59:44] they're a little closed up because
[1:59:45] they're not so sure because this brother
[1:59:47] who's a good brother he said something
[1:59:48] and made me wonder
[1:59:50] okay
[1:59:52] amen help us we all have to be careful
[1:59:56] I stand here this morning regretting
[1:59:58] things I said about other ministers I
[2:00:00] have regrets
[2:00:01] I regret being critical
[2:00:04] I regret that I let that come out of my
[2:00:07] mouth and my family heard or another
[2:00:08] Brotherhood
[2:00:11] I said God help us
[2:00:13] help us to show you respect
[2:00:16] if you called that man
[2:00:18] and you allowed the circumstances to
[2:00:20] work where he was in the Pulpit that day
[2:00:22] then I want to show you respect by
[2:00:24] showing respect to that office and if
[2:00:25] he's wrong I'll talk to him if he needs
[2:00:27] to be corrected he'll get corrected but
[2:00:28] I'm not going to put myself in a
[2:00:30] position position to disrespect because
[2:00:32] you called the man and you allowed him
[2:00:33] to stand here
[2:00:35] amen you may disagree with who's behind
[2:00:38] the pulpit amen but it's not your
[2:00:40] decision it's the pastor's decision and
[2:00:42] the pastor's the head of the church by
[2:00:44] God's ordination
[2:00:46] so when you start showing disrespect for
[2:00:48] that you're showing disrespect for God
[2:00:50] if there's a problem there's places to
[2:00:53] talk
[2:00:55] but not around dinner tables and
[2:00:57] fellowships
[2:00:59] that doesn't solve the problem that
[2:01:01] creates a bigger problem
[2:01:03] we cannot undermine God's way we cannot
[2:01:07] begin to to lose reverence and respect
[2:01:10] above everything God give me reverence
[2:01:12] and respect because God will honor my
[2:01:14] reverence and respect even to a man
[2:01:16] who's wrong if he's wrong God will deal
[2:01:18] with him but God will not if I lose
[2:01:20] respect for a god-given position then
[2:01:22] I'm in trouble with God
[2:01:24] yeah now it's not about whether the
[2:01:26] man's right or wrong it's about me being
[2:01:28] respectful to God
[2:01:31] right that doesn't give a minister a
[2:01:32] license to say whatever he wants he'll
[2:01:34] be corrected by the word too
[2:01:36] he'll get his chastisement and everybody
[2:01:38] has a right to ask any Minister why he
[2:01:40] said what he said
[2:01:42] everybody has that right just like Mom
[2:01:44] has a right to ask Dad
[2:01:46] you better do it respectfully
[2:01:48] you better show honor to God
[2:01:51] and one of the worst things you can say
[2:01:53] is that man's not even called to preach
[2:02:01] you may feel every wave that's wrong and
[2:02:04] it doesn't connect or whatever
[2:02:05] but what if God did call that man to
[2:02:07] preach
[2:02:09] what if he did for the what if reason I
[2:02:12] won't say that
[2:02:14] because if God did but I don't think he
[2:02:16] did and I don't feel well maybe your
[2:02:19] feelings are off that day maybe you're
[2:02:21] not 100 in your discernment
[2:02:24] but to let that come out of your mouth
[2:02:25] and to say that to another person
[2:02:28] that was sitting in the congregation
[2:02:30] that day
[2:02:35] that man has not even called he
[2:02:37] shouldn't even be in the pulpit
[2:02:38] then how did he get there
[2:02:42] was it through God's provided way or not
[2:02:44] if it was wrong it'll be corrected
[2:02:46] if he doesn't have a Ministry God will
[2:02:48] expose it if it's not right but for the
[2:02:51] chance that maybe he is he just had an
[2:02:53] off day or he is and maybe he hasn't
[2:02:55] come into his gift yet maybe he is and
[2:02:57] he can't get past himself for the chance
[2:02:58] that maybe he is I won't say that
[2:03:01] because if the man believes he was
[2:03:03] called and he says God called me who am
[2:03:05] I to say God didn't I wasn't there I
[2:03:07] didn't hear the conversation I don't
[2:03:09] perfectly know what's in God's mind just
[2:03:12] because I feel one way or the other
[2:03:17] we're going to have our children
[2:03:19] destroyed by she bears
[2:03:22] if we don't properly respect God
[2:03:28] amen
[2:03:31] it's not easy but it's true
[2:03:34] and we're all guilty
[2:03:36] I'm guilty I'm ashamed of things that
[2:03:39] I've said and I've asked God to forgive
[2:03:41] me
[2:03:42] because you can ruin a man's reputation
[2:03:45] and use it ruin his ability to help
[2:03:47] somebody else
[2:03:48] and he might just be just the tool God
[2:03:50] was going to use
[2:03:52] but because you put a doubt in
[2:03:54] somebody's mind
[2:03:59] I said God help us all
[2:04:01] I want to stay in respect
[2:04:03] I want the word to be masculine I want
[2:04:06] God offices to be masculine I want I
[2:04:09] want to respect that and if it's wrong
[2:04:11] I'll go talk to the brother I'll ask him
[2:04:13] if and if he doesn't listen I'll ask God
[2:04:15] to take care of it because God's
[2:04:16] responsible for that because God put
[2:04:17] that over me
[2:04:22] please help me God never to find myself
[2:04:25] being the wrong kind of woman
[2:04:27] and undermining what God is doing
[2:04:31] help us we should have enough we should
[2:04:34] have enough teaching by now enough
[2:04:36] respect for God's way because the
[2:04:39] prophet taught us this way
[2:04:41] that if there's something that's wrong
[2:04:42] or needs to address that we can go to
[2:04:44] that individual and talk to them and not
[2:04:45] have already talked to five people
[2:04:53] because it might have been a situation
[2:04:55] easily resolved
[2:04:57] maybe there's something you didn't
[2:04:58] understand or maybe there's something
[2:05:00] the minister actually had wrong said
[2:05:02] wrong or even misunderstood and he can
[2:05:04] come back next time and say listen I was
[2:05:06] wrong on that a brother come and talk to
[2:05:08] me and show me a better way and I'm
[2:05:09] sorry but this is the right way and then
[2:05:11] nobody in that room has lost respect for
[2:05:13] that Ministry
[2:05:16] amen but if you do it the other way over
[2:05:18] the fellowship after church
[2:05:22] and then it gets around to that man
[2:05:26] what have we done
[2:05:29] what evil
[2:05:31] evil I'm gonna call it evil it's evil
[2:05:33] what evil have we done
[2:05:37] and we think we're so spiritual while
[2:05:39] we're doing it because we know he's not
[2:05:41] a call man he should have said that I
[2:05:42] know the message what you're doing is
[2:05:44] you're putting yourself over God's
[2:05:46] offices
[2:05:48] because you're too proud of yourself
[2:05:50] and you think you know something that
[2:05:52] man doesn't know
[2:05:54] I say God help us
[2:05:57] this Prophet came and was a manly man
[2:06:01] to put us back in respect to God
[2:06:03] and it's going to take men standing
[2:06:05] behind the pulpit to keep us in respect
[2:06:07] to God so that we don't find ourselves
[2:06:10] being a foolish woman and tearing down
[2:06:12] our own house
[2:06:15] God help us all
[2:06:17] we all need a good switching for the
[2:06:20] things that we've said about brothers
[2:06:21] and sisters and Things We Said about
[2:06:22] ministers every one of us need it
[2:06:25] we need to keep our line lined up the
[2:06:29] word is over the church
[2:06:32] and the church is subject to the word
[2:06:35] the father is over his wife in his home
[2:06:37] and they're all subject to the father
[2:06:40] the the fifo ministry is over the church
[2:06:42] the pastors over a local church and
[2:06:44] that's the way God wants it and we have
[2:06:46] to stay reverent to that and if we stay
[2:06:49] reverent to that God will bless us and
[2:06:51] if it's wrong rest assured God will take
[2:06:53] care of it
[2:06:54] he still has a switch and he still knows
[2:06:57] how to use it
[2:06:59] nobody's getting away with anything
[2:07:02] we may think but because God is
[2:07:04] long-suffering that's so you have a
[2:07:06] chance to repent amen when you don't
[2:07:07] repent sometimes God sits back and lets
[2:07:10] Hey listen sometimes we think well
[2:07:12] nothing was correct nothing happened
[2:07:14] it's okay with God just because nothing
[2:07:16] happens quickly when you fall and you
[2:07:18] fail doesn't mean nothing happened with
[2:07:19] God maybe he's going to let you get a
[2:07:21] little comfortable and give the cow a
[2:07:23] little bit of rope
[2:07:25] God must not mind it's okay all right do
[2:07:27] it again until all of a sudden that
[2:07:30] little Spirit of rebellion comes into
[2:07:31] full opening rebellion and God will take
[2:07:33] care of it once
[2:07:36] not as a seed but when it bears fruit
[2:07:40] yeah amen
[2:07:42] God doesn't miss anything
[2:07:45] don't think you're getting away with
[2:07:47] anything we're not getting away with
[2:07:48] nothing
[2:07:50] God will take care of it and God will
[2:07:52] straighten us back out
[2:07:54] we've all been wrong
[2:07:57] but God
[2:07:59] calling us back to reverence
[2:08:02] back to respect for his word and
[2:08:05] everything his word calls for
[2:08:08] if you have doubts about anything I said
[2:08:10] read the message brother bear I
[2:08:12] mentioned all of this
[2:08:15] order is God's plan and if we honor it
[2:08:18] God will honor us
[2:08:20] God will do whatever needs to be done to
[2:08:24] bring his word to pass and to take care
[2:08:26] of his wife and his children
[2:08:29] amen
[2:08:30] why is the church in chaos why is the
[2:08:32] world in chaos
[2:08:34] because the church left the headship of
[2:08:36] the word
[2:08:38] why are families in chaos because the
[2:08:41] man is no longer the head of his home
[2:08:43] he has to be equal with his wife and she
[2:08:46] has to have just as much say as him
[2:08:48] where is that in the Bible
[2:08:53] see the culture's ruined because we left
[2:08:56] the word
[2:08:58] the families are ruined because we left
[2:09:00] the word
[2:09:01] Our Lives will be ruined if we leave the
[2:09:03] word and instead of a blessing on our
[2:09:05] children we'll put a curse upon them
[2:09:09] God help us not to bring a curse
[2:09:13] help us not to teach others to
[2:09:15] disrespect first God correct me
[2:09:18] and bring me in line and then God help
[2:09:21] me not to wrongly influence others
[2:09:24] so that we stay in respect
[2:09:26] to God
[2:09:28] and we have to have respect
[2:09:30] for the masculine spirit
[2:09:34] says I'm going to read this last quote
[2:09:36] and we'll close
[2:09:38] he says you say you're always talking on
[2:09:40] our women about our women all right men
[2:09:42] I will comb you down once then let me
[2:09:45] tell you something any man that will let
[2:09:47] his wife smoke cigarettes and wear
[2:09:48] shorts I got little respect of him even
[2:09:50] being a man
[2:09:55] well you can say all you want what I'm
[2:09:57] supposed to be nice and I have to be
[2:09:58] brother bam said I doubt you even being
[2:10:01] a man
[2:10:05] you know sometimes people say well I
[2:10:07] can't control my children I can't
[2:10:08] control they can do whatever they want
[2:10:11] listen I don't know about you
[2:10:13] but
[2:10:15] I fund everything that happens in my
[2:10:17] house
[2:10:22] I fund everything that happens in my
[2:10:24] house
[2:10:25] and I can whine and say they won't
[2:10:27] listen to me they won't do anything and
[2:10:28] they keep drawing money out of my bank
[2:10:30] to go do what I told them not to do
[2:10:33] be a man and shut it off and say if you
[2:10:36] disrespect me I'm not going to be able
[2:10:37] to bless you
[2:10:40] my goodness be a man take your position
[2:10:43] it's your position amen you're the one
[2:10:47] who's facilitating the whole life of
[2:10:48] your family you've got the you're
[2:10:51] funding it you're giving the money
[2:10:52] you've got the bank account you make
[2:10:54] decisions you own the cars your name's
[2:10:56] on the title my goodness why are you
[2:10:58] standing by as if you can do nothing
[2:11:00] it's your responsibility brother Branham
[2:11:02] said as long as I'm alive and have a
[2:11:04] slat of wood I won't allow that to
[2:11:06] happen
[2:11:08] well sometimes you can't take a old
[2:11:10] Barrel slot and nothing but sometimes
[2:11:12] you can just say all right but that's it
[2:11:14] no more I'm done
[2:11:19] that's so mean there's nothing mean
[2:11:21] about it that's love
[2:11:24] because that has to bring everything
[2:11:26] back into God's order
[2:11:29] that's real love
[2:11:31] showing respect and showing reverence
[2:11:35] was Moses a perfect man
[2:11:38] not in any way shape or form was he
[2:11:40] chosen of God to be the deliverer and
[2:11:42] Lead his Nation yes did he have faults
[2:11:45] yes did he make mistakes yes but when
[2:11:48] his sister and brother disrespected him
[2:11:50] God slowed her with leprosy
[2:11:53] it wasn't about Moses it was about the
[2:11:55] office that God put him in
[2:11:57] it was about disrespecting God
[2:12:01] amen when they wanted a king amen and
[2:12:03] Samuel was the prophet Samuel comes in
[2:12:05] Christ the god they rejected me and God
[2:12:07] says they haven't rejected you they've
[2:12:08] rejected me
[2:12:10] by rejecting you they rejected me
[2:12:13] when we reject the headship of the male
[2:12:15] we're the headship of a husband amen you
[2:12:17] rejected God because that's God's word
[2:12:22] when we reject the prophet of the age
[2:12:24] we've rejected God
[2:12:26] because that's God's word
[2:12:28] I said God keep me keep me Keep Me
[2:12:32] in respect
[2:12:35] brother Brown goes on to say
[2:12:37] I just want to read this the way he says
[2:12:39] it
[2:12:40] says I got little respect of him even
[2:12:44] being a man he's so sisified he don't
[2:12:46] even know what he belongs to he ain't
[2:12:48] man that's right that's right he's a
[2:12:50] poor excuse for a man oh he may be six
[2:12:52] foot tall weigh 200 pound but that don't
[2:12:55] look like a man to me that shows whose
[2:12:57] boss around your house
[2:12:59] she will stomp her foot I'll tell you
[2:13:01] right now and you'll bow down like you
[2:13:04] was a sick kitten what's the matter
[2:13:08] oh lordy
[2:13:10] he knows what he's talking about
[2:13:13] what we need today is men we need gospel
[2:13:16] preachers any preacher that will stand
[2:13:18] in the pulpit and hold back on these
[2:13:19] things I got little respect of him being
[2:13:21] called of God
[2:13:22] a man that's ashamed to stand in the
[2:13:24] pulpit and tell the God's truth when he
[2:13:26] knows it's an immoral thing for a woman
[2:13:28] to cut her hair a man's got a right to
[2:13:30] leave his wife and give her a divorce
[2:13:32] when she cuts her hair
[2:13:34] listen this is what brother Brandon's
[2:13:36] saying
[2:13:39] the Bible said who's the head of the
[2:13:40] woman
[2:13:41] her husband in the Bible said If a woman
[2:13:43] cuts her hair she dishonors her head no
[2:13:45] dishonorable woman should be lived with
[2:13:47] amen she cuts off her glory and so does
[2:13:49] the church when she does the same thing
[2:13:51] she cuts her glory stream off oh God why
[2:13:53] do I say these things but it's the truth
[2:13:55] we don't need compromises we need men
[2:13:58] and women who will stand for justice and
[2:14:00] right and tell the truth regardless of
[2:14:01] what it is
[2:14:03] but the man says if a woman will cut off
[2:14:05] her hair because her hair shows that
[2:14:07] she's under the headship of her husband
[2:14:09] and if she dishonors her head by shaving
[2:14:12] or cutting her hair then he has a right
[2:14:14] to put her away in divorcement she's
[2:14:16] dishonorable woman and brother Benham
[2:14:17] said a dishonorable woman shouldn't even
[2:14:19] be lived with
[2:14:21] amen amen
[2:14:25] how many men have I talked to
[2:14:28] that told me when their families were
[2:14:31] struggling with the message
[2:14:33] struggling to believe and struggling
[2:14:34] with the standard and they says you know
[2:14:37] what I'm going to back off a little bit
[2:14:38] and stay close to my wife and my
[2:14:40] children and help them through this
[2:14:43] friends they lost their entire family
[2:14:50] they had a wife and children who begin
[2:14:51] to disbelieve the message and struggle
[2:14:53] when brother Ben said this and don't cut
[2:14:55] your hair and women can't dress this and
[2:14:57] they started and they started bickering
[2:14:58] at him and bickering around him
[2:14:59] bickering at him and so he was going to
[2:15:01] do the nice thing the cultural thing
[2:15:03] amen what Society tells us the laodicean
[2:15:06] attitude is okay I'm not going to be too
[2:15:08] firm that I'm not going to take my stand
[2:15:09] and I'm not going to push too hard what
[2:15:11] I'm going to do is back down and I'm
[2:15:13] going to get close and I'm just going to
[2:15:15] show love
[2:15:16] and as I show love to them I'll pull
[2:15:19] them back in amen that brother I had
[2:15:21] that conversation with he lost his
[2:15:23] entire family and he's alone now
[2:15:34] it doesn't work
[2:15:37] what he should have said that's for me
[2:15:40] and my house will serve the Lord
[2:15:42] this is the way it'll be here
[2:15:45] if you can't live here I can't force you
[2:15:47] to but this is the way it will be here
[2:15:50] I love you I want you to be here I
[2:15:52] always take care of you I always take
[2:15:54] responsibility for you but this I have
[2:15:56] to serve God
[2:15:59] and I have to stay in respect to God
[2:16:02] regardless of what you choose to do I
[2:16:04] don't want you to go and I don't want
[2:16:05] anything to happen but I have to serve
[2:16:08] God and this man had to dishonor God to
[2:16:11] love his family and now he stands in
[2:16:13] dishonor
[2:16:16] at least he would have been an honor
[2:16:18] with God even if we'd have been alone
[2:16:23] that that doesn't work
[2:16:26] I had another one of my children this is
[2:16:28] tell all day we won't do this very often
[2:16:30] so you better soak it up it's just today
[2:16:34] I had another one start to question why
[2:16:36] this and why that and is this right and
[2:16:38] this right and there wasn't anything bad
[2:16:39] it wasn't rebellious it was just
[2:16:41] questioning but the question would get
[2:16:42] to be a little bit more of a pushback
[2:16:44] and I said listen let me say something
[2:16:46] to you
[2:16:48] I said I'm responsible for this house
[2:16:51] and everybody under my care
[2:16:53] and as long as you live here this is the
[2:16:56] way it will be and I'm not even asking
[2:16:58] you to believe it
[2:16:59] you don't have to believe it you can
[2:17:02] disagree and that's fine you're a free
[2:17:04] moral agent and I said one day you're
[2:17:06] going to be old enough to have your own
[2:17:07] home and in your own home you're going
[2:17:09] to have to make your decision on how you
[2:17:10] want to serve God whether or not you
[2:17:12] want to serve God and how you want to
[2:17:14] serve God and you have every right and
[2:17:16] freedom to make that choice
[2:17:18] but until then this is the way it'll be
[2:17:20] you know what I just drew out of that
[2:17:23] child of respect and honor and
[2:17:25] masculinity you know what happened the
[2:17:27] troubles went completely away and I
[2:17:29] never had one more discussion and one
[2:17:31] more trouble why because I wasn't
[2:17:32] forcing him to be religious
[2:17:35] I wasn't forcing him to pretend to be a
[2:17:37] Christian I was just telling the way I
[2:17:40] was going to serve my God and everything
[2:17:41] under me was going to lie into this
[2:17:43] because I love God and I will serve God
[2:17:46] regardless of what you think
[2:17:49] sometimes your children need to know
[2:17:51] that they're not that big a deal
[2:17:54] so how can you say that listen if it's
[2:17:57] if it comes down to me or you or God I'm
[2:17:59] taking God
[2:18:00] I have no option
[2:18:02] I can't save you by leaving God I can
[2:18:05] only Save You by staying with God
[2:18:09] and so sometimes we you just need to we
[2:18:12] need to just be a man
[2:18:14] and just say listen I love you I love
[2:18:17] you to pieces
[2:18:19] but I can't leave this word this is my
[2:18:22] husband this is my mate this is my
[2:18:23] headship
[2:18:25] I can't forsake it
[2:18:27] you can believe what you want to believe
[2:18:29] and that's okay for me
[2:18:31] you can make decisions when you're old
[2:18:32] enough and free you can make decisions
[2:18:34] you want to make and that's okay with me
[2:18:35] I'll still love you
[2:18:37] I'm not forcing you to be a believer
[2:18:40] but I am going to have respect for God
[2:18:43] and the home that he's given me
[2:18:45] and if I'm using the money he's given me
[2:18:48] to make the payments and we're paying
[2:18:49] for a phone and we're paying for
[2:18:51] internet and we're paying by the money
[2:18:53] that God gives me I'm not going to allow
[2:18:54] any of that money to be used for evil
[2:19:00] and this home is consecrated to God and
[2:19:03] none of it I'm gonna I'm not giving your
[2:19:05] space over in the corner for you to live
[2:19:06] evil
[2:19:10] because I respect God
[2:19:16] I don't know
[2:19:18] maybe I'm a million ways from wrong
[2:19:20] but I believe it's right
[2:19:23] and I believe it will be the salvation
[2:19:25] of our families when men act like men
[2:19:27] and women act like ladies and everybody
[2:19:29] stays in their Lane and shows respect
[2:19:31] and allows the feminine attribute to be
[2:19:33] on display and allows the masculine to
[2:19:36] be on display and they come into harmony
[2:19:37] one with another I believe that'll be
[2:19:39] salvation and Redemption
[2:19:42] and Holiness and perfection in a home
[2:19:45] where boys can grow up to be men and
[2:19:48] where girls can grow up to be Godly
[2:19:49] ladies and women
[2:19:52] praise God
[2:19:54] his word is always right
[2:19:57] the culture is wrong my ideas if they're
[2:20:00] contrary to the word is wrong the word
[2:20:02] is always right and God demands respect
[2:20:06] and if God has to rock your jaw rock
[2:20:09] your jaws every once in a while to bring
[2:20:10] you back in respect that's the best
[2:20:12] thing that ever happened to you enough
[2:20:14] would God do that read the Bible
[2:20:17] look at brother Branham how many times
[2:20:20] did God talk to him like a man
[2:20:24] remember standing in the Gap he's weary
[2:20:26] from the ministry he wants to leave
[2:20:27] wants to run him and brother Benham says
[2:20:29] all right God comes and says you go on
[2:20:31] with your plans
[2:20:33] and you'll be a bum like that and your
[2:20:34] wife will leave she won't stay up there
[2:20:38] hey guess what brother Branham could
[2:20:40] take the Straight Talk from God
[2:20:42] he didn't come wishy-washy gobbled up
[2:20:45] footing he just came and he said
[2:20:46] what was going to happen this is what
[2:20:48] will happen this is why if you do that
[2:20:50] if you make that choice he didn't say
[2:20:52] you're not allowed to make that choice
[2:20:52] but he said if you make that choice
[2:20:55] this is what's going to happen these are
[2:20:57] the consequences and brother Branham
[2:20:59] could respond to that
[2:21:04] I know it's that Ministry that called me
[2:21:07] back into respect for them it was
[2:21:10] straight it was hard it was sometimes
[2:21:12] culturally unfitting sometimes it was
[2:21:15] shocking to my system having grown up in
[2:21:16] laodicea through the 80s and 90s amen
[2:21:19] and all of a sudden I would hear that
[2:21:21] and I say can he say that
[2:21:24] can a preacher say that
[2:21:27] but he was drawing me he was drawing
[2:21:29] masculinity out of me and he was drawing
[2:21:31] me back into respect for God
[2:21:34] and I'm so thankful because I would not
[2:21:36] have the family I have today if that man
[2:21:38] didn't preach the way he preached
[2:21:40] [Music]
[2:21:46] I wouldn't be where I was I'd be in
[2:21:47] disrespect or Dishonored to God
[2:21:49] somewhere
[2:21:50] not knowing my position being influenced
[2:21:53] by the culture and a home would be a
[2:21:55] mess
[2:21:56] but I thank God that he sent the right
[2:21:58] Ministry with the right temperament at
[2:22:01] the right time to say the right thing to
[2:22:03] draw me back into respect for God
[2:22:05] because God demands respect
[2:22:08] and I don't want to be found
[2:22:09] disrespecting
[2:22:12] I mean let's all stand
[2:22:19] musicians if you'll come
[2:22:24] we'll pray
[2:22:26] I just want to say I love you
[2:22:28] I love you everyone
[2:22:31] and I never intended to preach like this
[2:22:33] today it wasn't my plan
[2:22:36] but you know what
[2:22:39] God is an honest God
[2:22:44] he's not influenced by the culture
[2:22:46] and neither is he bending and changing
[2:22:48] his nature because of our culture
[2:22:52] we don't have to change because of the
[2:22:55] culture
[2:22:56] we can stay with what God called us to
[2:22:58] be
[2:22:59] and find that their safety protection
[2:23:02] love there's nurture there's safety in
[2:23:05] our home safety in our churches safety
[2:23:07] in the message safety in the bride
[2:23:09] because we have respect for God
[2:23:12] and everything's come back with
[2:23:14] masculine and feminist in the right
[2:23:16] place in the right order and brought
[2:23:18] about the right Unity to display the
[2:23:20] very attributes
[2:23:23] I say thank God for this message
[2:23:26] let's bow our heads and pray
[2:23:29] their Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[2:23:31] for your goodness to us
[2:23:34] Lord I I stand corrected this morning
[2:23:39] God you've dealt with me on things I've
[2:23:41] said and things I've done that I
[2:23:43] shouldn't have said
[2:23:44] and I shouldn't have done
[2:23:46] and Lord I realize now more than ever
[2:23:50] that when I disrespected your ministry I
[2:23:52] disrespected you
[2:23:56] God when I
[2:23:58] shirked my responsibility
[2:24:00] stand like a man I failed you
[2:24:03] I failed to display part of your
[2:24:05] character and part of your nature
[2:24:07] when I failed in my home to take my
[2:24:09] place
[2:24:12] Lord that was my fault
[2:24:15] Forgive Me Lord
[2:24:17] God if you'll help me
[2:24:19] I want to stay in respect to you
[2:24:22] in everything Lord in every way under
[2:24:25] every word
[2:24:27] I want to stand Lord and face you one
[2:24:29] day knowing regardless of what happened
[2:24:31] around me I honored you in your word
[2:24:35] I didn't put my feelings above your word
[2:24:37] I didn't put my ideas above your word
[2:24:40] I didn't put the feelings of other
[2:24:41] people above your word
[2:24:43] but God by your help and your grace
[2:24:45] would you help me Lord to surrender
[2:24:48] myself to all those things and allow you
[2:24:51] to be Lord Of My Life
[2:24:53] King over me in every area of my life
[2:24:58] I love you Lord
[2:25:00] I ask that you help us as a people
[2:25:02] may we as families
[2:25:05] stay in a healthy order
[2:25:07] that'll be healthy for our children
[2:25:10] that will give our sisters freedom to be
[2:25:12] nurturing and loving and sweet and
[2:25:14] tender that they won't have to be hard
[2:25:16] they don't have to be Burly they won't
[2:25:18] have to take responsibility because
[2:25:20] their husbands do for them
[2:25:22] and they can be nurturing and sweet and
[2:25:24] gentle with their children with others
[2:25:27] May men take the responsibility Lord to
[2:25:30] stand in the front line and be a
[2:25:32] Watchman at the wall and the gatekeeper
[2:25:34] of their home
[2:25:36] may they stay true to your word and keep
[2:25:38] their homes lined up to your word that
[2:25:40] your blessings might continue to flow
[2:25:42] that little boys and girls might grow up
[2:25:44] to be Godly men and women
[2:25:46] God may we as an assembly stay in the
[2:25:49] right order lord always giving reverence
[2:25:51] to your word above everything else
[2:25:53] May the messenger that you sent Lord be
[2:25:56] a voice of Authority for us
[2:25:58] may we recognize you and your attributes
[2:26:00] Lord and may we surrender as a body of
[2:26:03] Believers as a bride to those attributes
[2:26:07] we love you God
[2:26:08] may ask God for your help
[2:26:11] Lord may you keep us
[2:26:14] Lord we know that we can't keep
[2:26:15] ourselves
[2:26:17] it's going to be you Lord
[2:26:18] but all your correction is good
[2:26:22] it cleanses the soul it purges us from
[2:26:26] traps and snares that we didn't see and
[2:26:29] we didn't recognize
[2:26:30] it keeps us from going further down the
[2:26:32] wrong road your mercy and your grace
[2:26:35] will bring correction in a different
[2:26:36] understanding so that we might snap out
[2:26:39] of these things and come back and level
[2:26:41] with your word in reverence to your word
[2:26:43] that you might bless us
[2:26:45] God we thank you
[2:26:48] let your word
[2:26:49] be preeminent
[2:26:53] we love you gone we thank you for the
[2:26:56] way you do things we declare that they
[2:26:58] are right and that they are good
[2:27:01] love you Lord I ask you bless us as we
[2:27:04] part
[2:27:04] bless the fathers that are among us on
[2:27:07] this remembrance of Father's Day
[2:27:09] God may they continually take the
[2:27:11] responsibility that you've handed to
[2:27:12] them
[2:27:13] to Shepherd a wife and to Shepherd a
[2:27:15] flock
[2:27:16] God would you give them wisdom to do so
[2:27:19] give them understanding Lord that they
[2:27:21] might stay in the right place in the
[2:27:24] right vein
[2:27:25] so the whole family that's under them
[2:27:28] can be blessed
[2:27:30] pray God that you would bless our
[2:27:31] fathers for their Godly men
[2:27:34] there are Godly influence doing what
[2:27:36] you've called them to do I'm so proud of
[2:27:37] them and thankful for the fellowship
[2:27:39] with men like these
[2:27:40] I pray you'd bless them today and may
[2:27:42] their wives and their children show them
[2:27:43] reverence and respect that is due
[2:27:46] and God and may they know that they're
[2:27:48] loved and respected and may you know
[2:27:52] Lord that you're loved and you are
[2:27:54] respected we ask these things and you're
[2:27:56] helping these things in Jesus Christ's
