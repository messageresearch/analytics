[0:00] we believe we've seen the wave Chief in
[0:02] our day amen the same son of man was
[0:04] waved again
[0:05] it wasn't brother random wasn't the son
[0:08] of man he was a son of man revealing the
[0:10] son of man so where was the son of man
[0:12] he was being revealed in a son of man
[0:14] amen and that a son of man was being
[0:16] waved over because the son of man had
[0:18] come to maturity in a son of man
[0:21] amen
[0:23] and so now we saw it I mean we saw it
[0:25] clearly on display without mistake I
[0:28] mean so Vindicated and so proven by God
[0:30] so now we've seen that so what does that
[0:33] mean what is that what does that
[0:35] actually mean it means thank God it's
[0:38] Harvest Time thank God whatever happened
[0:41] to that first part is happening to the
[0:45] rest of us
[0:46] the every other part of the Bride field
[0:49] that's laying there this wheat plant
[0:52] this field that's got to come to harvest
[0:54] maturity at the end time whatever
[0:56] happened to that first part is the same
[0:58] thing that's happening to us that was a
[1:01] sign that the whole field is coming to
[1:03] harvest maturity not maybe not hope so
[1:07] but it's a sign that whatever brought
[1:09] this to maturity is going to bring the
[1:11] rest of it to maturity
[1:14] it's it's a Thanksgiving amen and so now
[1:18] when we see that Ministry when we see
[1:20] that life when we see that level of
[1:22] consecration that level of obedience
[1:24] that that manifestation uh of the word
[1:27] and the gifts of the Spirit and the the
[1:30] life of the spirit amen operating in
[1:32] that man it's not so that we can stand
[1:34] there and say oh what a man that was I
[1:37] mean that's our that's our reaction we
[1:39] appreciate and value what that was but
[1:41] if we just fixate on what was being
[1:43] waived we missed the whole point of it
[1:46] being waived
[1:48] because the whole point of the waving
[1:50] was that I can have absolute confidence
[1:53] in God that if God could take that part
[1:56] to maturity he can take me to maturity
[1:59] amen and he's already working the
[2:01] process because this is Harvest Time
[2:04] [Music]
[2:05] this is the the whole point of the sign
[2:09] that's been waived at the end time and
[2:11] the Messianic sign that's been shown in
[2:13] the Life of Christ on display through
[2:15] human flesh the whole point of that was
[2:17] not so that we can memorialize that and
[2:20] remember what was done so but that would
[2:22] give us Faith to recognize that all I
[2:25] need to do is lay in the presence of
[2:27] this Jesus Christ that has returned to
[2:29] his church and it'll bring me to the
[2:31] same Harvest maturity I'm on that same
[2:34] road I'm to that same destination that
[2:37] is my goal
[2:40] not not something I idolize but
[2:42] something I'm pointed to something that
[2:44] I'm that's showing me the way to walk in
[2:46] the direction I'm walking and the goal
[2:49] the place that I am coming to
[2:52] is that maturity
[2:55] how do you know there's already been a
[2:57] Thanksgiving wave
[2:59] and it's already been a sign
[3:02] believing that the rest of them is going
[3:04] to come
