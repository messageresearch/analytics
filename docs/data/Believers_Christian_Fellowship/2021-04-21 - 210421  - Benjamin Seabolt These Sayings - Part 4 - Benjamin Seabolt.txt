and believe [Applause] [Applause] just to hope will amen i'm so glad that i'm one of the few this evening lord prepare me is this your prayer this evening [Music] right i'll be for you oh lord pre-paid me to be a saint to [Music] where [Music] with [Music] thank you praise the lord let's just pray together precious lord jesus we just want to pause here a moment to thank you once again for this opportunity that you've given us lord what a privileged people we are father to be able to come and to assemble ourselves together and not just a social event or for fellowship lord but to come and to worship the one and true living god lord and to recognize what form that that god has chose to come in in our age that we could worship you the way that you desire to be worshiped lord and we could recognize you for who you are the revealed word of our hour lord i pray that we would just come and submit both speaker and hearer to you at this point lord for we know that the task at hand is not something a mortal man is capable of doing but only the lamb can come and to break the book lord and to feed his sheep father so we would just yield ourself to you that you would come that you would have the preeminence and you would do that which only you can do we surrender ourselves to you now for you to have the glory in jesus christ's name we pray the bride says amen god bless you if you have your bibles we'll go straight to the word the book of john chapter 10 and i'd like to pick up and lord willing finish on this topic of these sayings i believe we can wrap that up this evening if it be the will of the lord we're going to go to chapter 10 and verse 24. john chapter 10 verse 24 says then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him god bless you as you would have your seats i'm just going to do a very quick review as we would move forward and i want to read this quote again obviously very familiar but just in case somebody is here that doesn't know where we're coming from then they can have a little bit of a foundation and the seed is not here with the shock brother branham says luther had justification wesley had sanctification pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts but then i'm sorry but when the word come now they could produce that justification will save a man sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as i believe the stalk is part of the wheat sure it is but it's the carrier it ain't the life then along came sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the bible you have to so still that's not it but then came the pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues there they called that the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say i and my father are one and these other things then the shuck pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever so brother branham just in this small paragraph and in this small quote lays so many definitions and so many um generational dispensations here just in this one quote defining what luther was defining what wesley was defining what the pentecostal movement was and defining that movement as the shuck that the seed would then come out of and identifying the seed as the true word all of the word and that included a people that would have a faith and an understanding and a belief and a revelation to the point that they could unashamedly declare i and my father are one and this has to come with a proper revelation and i i so appreciated well i've appreciated all the messages that our pastor has brought here but just recently he's he he touched on this we have to make sure that our revelation of our manifestation does not overlap a manifestation of another so if we're bribed we need to be bribed we don't need to be the manifestation of another and brother branham says this he says when i teach the oneness of god he says i do not believe that god is one like your finger as one so here is jesus standing there saying i and my father are one but brother branham would say that he's not teaching a oneness of god that one as your finger is one so jesus could say when you've seen me you've seen the father but it's still not the same as your finger one being one and what he's saying is i and my father are one i and my father are the same spirit and when you've seen me you have seen the father you have seen the spirit of the father remember the father is the spirit form and that's what he's saying he's not remember brother branham says jesus could not be his own father so only revelation is going to give us the proper understanding and the proper positioning of that because if it's not by revelation you're not going to be you're not going to be firm enough but without revelation you're going to be too firm jesus could have not been firm enough and he could have said well maybe i'm a child of god maybe i'm the son or he could have been too firm and he could have said i i am my own father see there has to be and brother brandon says he clearly a son clearly can't be their own father that's the very definition of a son as something that comes out of the father so it has to come by revelation it has to come by the the spirit of revelation for us to be the proper manifestation of the bride to have the proper declaration that i and the father are one but i'm not the father i and the sun are one but i'm not the sun and he taught very clearly on that so i don't need to rehash that but i just really appreciated that because that matches what brother random was trying to tell us through the message on the on the godhead and on the oneness of god he said it is not one like your finger this finger can only have one manifestation but this finger is part of my hand that can have five manifestations and now there's another hand and it has five more manifestations but all five all ten of those are a manifestation of this one body if that makes sense so we have to stay within that position we have to stay within that understanding in order to manifest properly what we are to manifest so we want to manifest i and my father are one but we don't want to get to the point that we're trying to be our own father we're trying to be our own god let's look at a couple of these scenes right before we would move forward that we've already touched on we've learned that it's the father's business to destroy denominational thinking by explaining the scriptures with their true spiritual meaning and to fulfill the scriptures that is written of yourself and this goes right along with what i was just saying we don't want to be trying to fulfill a scripture that was written for somebody else or that was written for another manifestation or another dispensation so we want to have a true spiritual revelation of the scriptures that pertain to us and not back down on those not back down on those one iota but not overstep that either for the proper manifestation the true believer has the power to remit sin the sin of unbelief by presenting the living word for the day the same as jesus and any other true believer of the ages that have been passed we've learned that all hell is against the revelation of christ to the individual we've learned that the spirit of truth says jesus christ is come in the flesh not just he was or that he will be we've learned that the true bride doctrine is the spiritual bride is the word made flesh and blood again we've learned that her teaching is not wilt thou be reformed but rather wilt thou be made whole the believer does nothing but what the father shows them whosoever hears the words of the believer and believeth on him that sent him can pass from death unto life the believer contest can say search the scriptures for they testify of me he can also he can also say i am come in my father's name we've learned that the work of god is to believe on him whom he hath sent that should give anybody with a legalistic spirit following them around so much liberty not by works of this carnal flesh but the work of god as defined by the scripture by jesus himself is to simply believe on him that is sent of god and if you believe on him that is sent of god no doubt you're going to have works i am the bread of life i am the light of the world i have come down from heaven where i was taught of my father and i will return there the words that the believer speaks are spirit and they are life and probably as we said last time the most important thing that we have learned is that the antichrist denominational spirit is within our own framework that we carry around each and every day the antichrist spirit within the framework of the true christian church is not out there it's not even right beside of you it is right with you each and every day and that is the shock that we need to be worried about that is the shock that we need to pay attention to and that is the shock that we want to pull away because what good does it do if they all pull away or if the person sitting beside of you pulls away if you don't pull away from your own shock and have your atoms change does no good let's turn to john 7 as we would move forward and i don't intend to be very lengthy uh there was just a few things that i want to wrap up here obviously once you start laying down several of these other things they all start blending together so you just start saying the same thing over and over again and that's not exactly what i want to do i just want to reveal these things for what they are and no doubt in your own studies you can go back and pick these things up and more than anything i just wanted to draw attention to the fact that these are things that we have been preaching these are things that we are setting under but these are these are things that that have been being said and have been transpiring and maybe we just weren't privy to it maybe we just didn't recognize it for what it was as i and my father are one and these other things so when we look in john chapter 7 beginning at verse 14 now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught and the jews marveled saying how knoweth this man letters have he never learned they're saying how does this man know the scripture and he was not in school with us that's what they're saying jesus answered them and said my doctor doctrine is not mine but his that sent me here is the key that list that i just read you of the bride being the spiritual bride being the word made flesh and blood of her having the power to remit sins of her being the bread of life of her being the light of the world none of that is true you can say that you can declare that you can even declare it forcefully and boldly but none of that is actually true unless you also make this statement my doctrine's not my own it is his that sent me because at the end of the day it makes no difference and it doesn't amount to here's a good country term for you a hill of beans what i say or what you say unless that doctrine is not your own and it's his that sent you now if it is his that sent you it means a lot and you can say that unashamedly and unbashfully and stand on that with your life the same as jesus did my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself if any man will do the will of god if any man will seek the will of god he will know whether this doctrine that i speak is mine or if it is from my father watch this identification that he lays in here so simple but so profound it is so effective i would venture to say you could probably recognize 99 of false doctrine by this next statement he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him if a man is teaching something to draw you to him and for his own glory i'm venturing to say it's not the doctrine of the father it's that simple but when you see a man not concerned about his own glory or lifting himself up but simply pointing to the word and pointing to the truth and pointing to the father and trying to help the sheep i would be very careful i would be very careful to say well that's just what he thinks he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him such discernment that can come with that simple statement such discernment did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keep with the law why go ye about to kill me the people answered and said thou hast the devil who goeth about to kill thee jesus answered answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel this is a conversation that took place right after he made the man whole and they're still all upset about it says the people answering it said thou hast the devil who goeth about to kill thee jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man if a man on the sabbath day receives circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every wet hole on the sabbath day this doesn't even make good logical sense and that's all jesus is telling them you all just aren't even making any sense you'll circumcise a man so that you can keep the letter of the law god forbid you would break the letter of the law but here i will make a man whole completely circumcise him make him whole on the sabbath day and you're all up in arms about it and you want to kill me the letter killeth the spirit giveth life it's the same battle from the beginning a letter with no revelation a letter with no revelation jesus said judge not according to appearance to the appearance but judge righteous judgment jesus is telling them don't judge this by inkblots on paper what you can reason and prove out in your carnal mind that this is clearly thou shalt thou shalt not he said judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment righteous judgment will never go against the ink blots on paper but you can have the understanding thinking you have the understanding of the ink blots on paper and not have righteous judgment just in this case there is clearly a law here that nothing can be done on the sabbath day but there's an exemption to that law that a man can be circumcised on the sabbath day and without revelation they're wanting to kill jesus for making a man whole on the sabbath day because without revelation they cannot understand the spirit of circumcision they're just looking at a physical circumcision not catching the spiritual application so they're technically right but they're spiritually completely wrong to the point that they want to kill the man who's not even breaking the law because they think with their reasoning they can technically have him dead to rights judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill i find it comical that they just called him crazy a few a few verses up because he told them that they wanted to kill him but it's common knowledge the people was like well this is the god that they want to kill and jesus says you want to kill me because i've done this and they're like you're crazy you got a devil we never said that what are you talking about righteous judgment but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ how be it we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth once he is then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come so jesus is coming in and having a conversation he's like i've done this you want to kill me you're crazy we don't want to kill you why would we want to do something like that the common people say isn't this god that they want to kill i wonder if the rulers know that he's the christ and they're just not telling us but they still don't have that revelation that this is the christ and jesus comes and this is what they're hung up on they're hung up on the fact that they know this guy i know this guy he can't be the christ don't leave it back there saints i know where he come from i was his third grade teacher i know i know this guy this is not the christ jesus cried in the temple as he taught saying yes you know me you know where i've come from but do you really and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me it's too much for them it's too much for them then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come don't get hung up on the fact that you know that person don't get hung up on the facts that you can and they are facts of their bad spots they're good spots they're in between spots they're bad days they're good days their background the trial that they're going through right now the trial that they just went through don't get hung up on the fact that you know that person and you know the response and declare yourself into a position that you're not in a manifestation that you're not into a seed of judgment already judge not that ye be not judged they were standing there with factual data they knew him and they knew where he come from and jesus never denied it you do know me and you know where i come from but then he would turn right back around and say you don't know who that sent me help help me understand you just told me that i know you and i know where you come from but i don't know how you got here and i don't know who that sent you let the prophet bring some clarity to this or if you have no revelation more confusion to that in 1965 communion he said if somebody back there would say william branham he was a rank rascal see because i was born in charles of charles and ella branham in their nature i was a sinner i came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there two was another nature present see predestinate was in there by god in this same body see two natures in there well i only catered to one but down in there was a little speck of life all the time what was it there was another william branham a little spot of eternal life down in there from the genes of god the word of god that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working see there was something moving but yet all at once i looked up and i said i'm not the son of charles and elebrana i thought he just said that they that he was a ranked rascal from charles and alibranum is this not the same dialogue as this not the same uh verbiage that jesus christ himself used we're not disputing the fact that we're a rank rascal we're not disputing that you know where i come from and you know who i am but don't get so focused on that that you miss me i'm not the son of charles and ella branham then i was born again notice what he types the birth the rebirth to the recognition that he was not just the son of charles and alibranum don't get confused about the new birth when you get to the point that you have a proper understanding that you are not just the child of your earthly parents you were born again because the only way you could have that revelation is directly from god the word has got to come to the word in you and give you that proper understanding brother brano says that's what the new birth is he said is when the word comes to the word i'm not the son of charles and ella branham then i was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of god's forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more now we stand justified as though we never sinned in the presence of god that should bring some clarity to what jesus was trying to say the prophet laid it right out with the same verb verbiage same situation the real me the word me covered up by a rank rascal john 8 58 jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am this is after that he has told them you know where i come from you know who i am but you don't know of him that sent me and now he comes and says before abraham was i am john 16 28 i come forth from the father and i'm coming to the world again i leave the world and go to the father there is no way without spiritual revelation you can make heads or tales of what he is saying there is no way without spiritual revelation you could you could have ever recognized what he was trying to say and who he was and the same applies to each and every one of us without true spiritual revelation your hybrid mind and your hybrid flesh will not allow you to come to that understanding it will beat that revelation down the same the way the pharisees wanted to beat jesus down it takes a true and proper spiritual revelation from god himself to be able to declare those things and have that understanding you will never overcome that by willpower you will never overcome that by trying harder you will never overcome that by your mental prowess it is the sovereign grace of god the word coming to the word in you is the only thing that can spark and give you that revelation john 8 46 jesus speaking said which of you can convince me of sin this is another one of those other things which of you can convince me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god john 10 verse 7 then jesus said again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep if you weren't catching what jesus was saying back in chapter 7 when he comes and starts starts laying these things down to them it's no wonder they wanted to kill him because with when they missed that revelation there in chapter seven everything that he says after that is blasphemy and that's what they wanted to kill him for and they would have been correct in doing so if it wasn't blasphemy just like god would be correct enslain each and every one of us for even thinking let alone saying these other things unless it was true and unless a vindicated prophet came and exposed those mysteries to us they would have been correct in carrying out their punishment on him but it was true jesus said unto her chapter 11 verse 25 i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live are you the resurrection are you the life are you a part of that resurrection do you have the life of god in you don't leave it 2000 years ago john 15 verse 1 jesus said i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth forth that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you that's a big statement can you say it you can if your doctrine is not of your own and it's of him that sent you and you're not seeking your own glory you're seeking the glory of the father anything else is punishable by death anything short of that will only result in spiritual death verse 22 if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not sinned but now they have no cloak for their sin look at the position and the seriousness that we should take that with the word that has been delivered to us saints is not a light message it is not a light word it is it is not a frivolous thing our existence on this earth is not a frivolous helter skelter do what i want come as you go come and go whatever i feel like doing today this is the door to the sheep you're not the door to the sheep but this is the door to the sheep that the father will use in order to redeem those sheep he's got to get his word to them how else is he going to get his word to them jesus said if i had not come what was jesus the word if the word had not come and declared itself to them they would not be in sin if the word had not come in our day the baptist the methodists the denominational system would not be in sin but it has come and it has declared itself openly and therefore we now therefore they now have no cloak for their unbelief the same thing that transpired 2 000 years ago is the same thing that transpired in our age is the same position that we find ourselves in your co-worker may not have sin but when the word is presented to him in your life and gives him a proper understanding between right and wrong now he has no cloak for that sin don't live a life that they that they're they're going to have an argument at that day say well i don't want them to be condemned so you don't want them to have a chance at life because you can't have one without the other that's a hard saying but jesus himself said it he says the word of god comes to do two things it the word of god comes to bring out the believer and it comes to condemn the unbeliever he told the disciples go and baptize him that will be saved will be baptized him that will not be baptized they're damned the word of god has to go forth it has to go forth for life to come forth if it's rejected and there's judgment from that that's not your fault it happened in jesus day it happened when the prophet was here it's happened since the beginning of time the only way for somebody not to be condemned is for the word not to go forth the only way for all of us to be condemned is for the word not to go forth nobody can come to life without the word we have to present the word we leave the judgment to the father if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not sinned jesus did not say i wish i would have never come so that they could have went on in their sin don't live a life that way saints don't live a life that way that they had that excuse at that day i didn't know any better you never told me you never showed me you never did anything to make me ask a question you never made me think you were any different than anybody else how was i to know how can you condemn me i didn't know any better it's solemn i know it's it's serious but it's true the position that we find ourselves in john 8 28 then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that i am he jesus is not speaking to his disciples here he is not speaking to the unbeliever i'm sorry he is not speaking to the believer because the believer has the capability to recognize him for who he is prior to him being lifted up him being lifted up was him being lifted up and crucified and he's telling them the unbeliever when the son of man is lifted up then you're going to know then then ye shall know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things what did the roman soldier say after the crucifixion surely this was the son of god we want to look at this pattern here in the masterpiece brother branham says don't let anybody wait too long lord he's praying he says don't let anybody wait too long lord looks awful close the harvest is truly ripe the great combine of god will sw sweep through the land one of these days straws will fly every way but the weak shall be gathered to the garner taken up for it is life now as i read these next few quotes i want you to hold john 8 28 in your mind because this is the exact same thing i'm going to read it again then jesus said unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things we're going to focus and look at this great combine of god and i think you're probably going to have a different viewpoint of it when i get to the end of it how many want to go in the great combine of god i'll find out when i get when i get done reading how many have heard the prophet say i can hear the coming of the combine i can hear the coming of the combine like over and over he says this i can hear the coming of the combine he says it 11 times i can hear the coming of the combine but six of those times he gives us definitions of the process of the combine the identified masterpiece of god let me back up to this one that i just read in the masterpiece so this he says the great combine of god will sweep through the land one of these days now look at the process that he lays to the combine straws will fly every way the wheat will be gathered to the garner the identified masterpiece of god now lord when we see the shock now pulling away from the grain going worldly the shock has to pull away so that the grain can get in the presence of the sun i hear the coming of the combine lord it won't be long and then the great elevator will take up his bride into the glory in the presence of god he hears the coming of the combine the shock is pulling away from the grain and it has to pull away so that the grain can be in the presence of the sun it won't be long and then the great elevator will take his bride up into glory into the presence of god the elevator is part of the combine for those that aren't privy to that knowledge the elevator is a part of the combine that expels the grain into the garner into the truck into the safe place 1964 the harvest time but thank god the grain is going on then if that is true by the word this is in the message harvest time so brother branham just went through the whole teaching on typing the true word of god with the wheat plant and he's saying if it's true if this teaching if it's true by the word to where we're living and it's true by nature it's vindicated the corn of wheat every way how much longer do we have you know what i hear the coming of the combine the world council will separate it how many wants to go in the combine now i hear the coming of the combine the world council she'll separate it she'll separate what she'll separate the shuck from the wheat she'll separate the stalk from the grain 1965 the seed is not air with the shuck set here tonight and see what eagles really can eat the word and have a living christ living among them showing himself alive the same yesterday today and forever they don't want to be heirs with the shock they're to be burned all the straws and things is to be burned the combine is coming to beat the weed out you want to be weak how many wants to go into the combine to get beat 1965 the rapture we're right there ready now the only thing the church is coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen the great combine will come by after a while remember we know what the combine is now it will come by after a while the stalks will be burned but the grain will be gathered into the garner look at the process that he's now putting into this if you want to call it a parable or this type look at the definitions and the process and the verbiage that he's laying in there 1965 modern events are made clear by prophecy the grain is here it'll be gathered into the garner it was the bride that part of it but what did he say would happen to the stalk it'll be burned with unquestionable fire seek salvation now while you can be a grain not a stalk go into the life not the old dead form go into the life of christ the word made manifest and vindicated so this is the gathering time the combine is coming you'd better get into the grain because the shucks going to be left behind i found this extremely interesting because my view of the combine changed drastically when i read this the combine is the world council of churches that's going to beat the wheat away from the stalk that is not going to be a pleasant process but you want to know what the end result of that is it's the same thing that jesus said when ye have lifted up the son of man are we not in a son of man ministry then shall ye know that i am she that i am he and that i do nothing of myself now remember don't try to put yourself in one part of this phrase if you can't put yourself in all of it don't try to say that you are she if you cannot also say that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things so if you're teaching something other than what the father says don't try to put yourself in there but if you can align yourself and yield yourself and surrender yourself to all three of those things don't back up on it because that is the end of the process that the unbeliever is going to see that the foolish virgin and the lost are going to see when the son of man is lifted up the result is that the foolish virgin and the lost brother branham called him cannon fodder they will know as he said in christ is the mystery of god revealed he will take her he will set her up here and away he'll go with her she will go into that combine she will be beaten but she's going to go in an elevator and then we're done then we're done you see that sounds pretty dreary it's not a real good roses and flowery bed of each sermon no but it's real and it's what's coming here's the key it says the combine is going down through the field if it runs into a husk that is real real tight real real tight against a piece of an ear of corn that still has moisture in it that moisture will hold it together it's going to be a real rough process when it goes in that combine it's going to be a rough process anyhow but it's going to be real rough on that one that's why brother branham says i hear the coming of the combine the grain has got to pull away from the shuck lay in the these aren't just cliches saints it's not just message talk and write a song about it and whatever else this is real he's telling us these things to catch it it's not just a cliche lay in the presence of the sun what's he trying to tell us there's a combine coming that's going to strip the shuck off of the seed and what you can do to help yourself out right here and now is get rid of all the shuck on you that you can separate yourself from your hybrid spirit and your carnal desires as much as you can right now so that when that combine does come it's a lot easier process it's not going to be easy any way that you take it but what you don't want to be doing is having that combine rip step up stuff off of you that you could have laid down years ago it will if you need it to it's going to accomplish the purpose if you need it to but that's not the spirit that should be in the bride that is not the nature that we should be operating under brother branham says you say you'll wait until that time comes he says it will be too late then because you've already taken the spirit of it what is the spirit of it the spirit of his rebellion the spirit of it is not yielding the spirit of it is not giving him the preeminence but if your seed it'll take that off of you but why not lay it down now that we have a chance god has been so gracious to us and revealed himself to us so much to give us an opportunity to come willingly to come if we want to say easier not easily we know we're fighting hybrid flesh and a hybrid mind it's not easy it's a it's a it's a daily struggle it's a daily beating but why not you know what i would rather beat myself up than have somebody else beat me up i would rather hit myself in the stomach than have somebody else hit me in the stomach if there's a beating that's got to be given i would rather beat myself than have somebody beat me if there's things that need stripped off of me i would rather lay in the presence of the sun now and have that shuck dry up and peel back easily then i would have that shuck hanging on real tight and getting ripped off when i go through the combine if your seed you're going to end up in that elevator period that's not the question that's not what i'm preaching i'm not preaching if you don't do this you're going to be lost you're coming you're coming and i'm going to be there but i would much rather go through that smoothly than i would be screaming for dear life he's given us that opportunity he has given us insight of this process he's came and he's given definitions of what these things are and what these things are that's coming the same way that jesus told the disciples i've told you these things so that when they transpire you'll know what they are what we don't want to happen saints is the combine come which we now know is the world council of churches you say oh that's just a thing you know people saints it's real and it's working and you're going to be shocked how quickly it takes power and what you don't want to do is sit there with your head spinning what's going on what's going on ouch that hurt what's going on why are they taking this right away from me and why are they putting me over here and why can i not pray for that brother anymore what is going on help me no we want to prepare ourselves want to prepare ourselves so that when these things transpire we'll recognize them for what they are and when that combine starts ripping stuff off of us we don't start questioning our sonship or our position we simply recognize it for what it is and here's what i'll tell you is if you start going through that process of having stuff ripped off of you right now your confusion is going to be way less when that transpires because you're going to wake up and something's going to get ripped off of you and you'll be like oh well that felt like that thing that i ripped off yesterday maybe this is just the same process it's going to be less confusing and you know what maybe that being less confused isn't even for your benefit but maybe there'll be somebody a new believer right there beside of you who is seed who hasn't been exposed to all the teaching and and laid in the presence of the sun as long as we have that maybe we can be a benefit to them because we're not as confused it may not be may not even be for your benefit it may be you being in that position of being steady and as our pastor taught us sunday i've already been in a position of trusting the father to where when these things get starts getting stripped off left and right we can hold steady and we can say just trust the father are you his son are you his daughter just hold steady just let it go let it go it's hybrid you don't need it anyhow it's shock just let it go we've read those quotes now let's go back to chapter 8 28 then jesus said unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man do you think it was optional whether or not the son of man got lifted up it was not optional it was going to happen but jesus did not lift himself up what lifted jesus up civil and ecclesiastical powers chapter 19 then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him just stay with me a little bit longer we're finishing with this scripture then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him and the soldiers there's your two political powers civil powers we'll get to the religious few verses down but notice who is involved here then pilate therefore took jesus and scorched him and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put him on a purple robe and said hell king of the jews and they smote him with their hands pilate therefore went again and saith unto them unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him that's a life saints that's a life that's the testimony that i want the people surrounding my life to be able to say when that combine comes to start beating me out why are you all doing that i don't find any fault in him that's the life that i want to live then jesus came forth wearing the crown of thorns in the purple robe you think this was comfortable in his flesh at this point and pilate saith unto them behold the man when the chief priest therefore in the officer saw him there's your third one the chief priest there's your civil and ecclesiastical powers with the political leader of that day the army the political leader and the chief priest the religious sect therefore in the officer saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take him and crucify him for i find no fault in him this is shocking to me take him and crucify him but i don't find any fault in it why would a man having found no fault in somebody say crucify him is because the civil and ecclesiastical powers had something to say to pilate whenever he tried to talk him out of this they said if you don't go along with this scheme if you don't take our side you're an enemy to caesar see it's the same thing that's going to transpire in our day brother branham said sorry to get away from this but this is just fresh so take it brother branham said the image to the beast joins together to fight communism you don't want to fight communism you don't want to fight communism so you're for them you're you're against caesar see the trap see the spirits it's the same thing you're not against communism you don't you don't want to fight against communism you got to be for it you're an enemy against us see the image to the beast is its intention is not the message believers to begin with that's not the problem that's not what they're coming to fight they're coming brother branham says they join together to fight communism he did not say they joined together to fight the true bride they join together to fight communism but now here's a group of people that says if my subjects were of this world they would fight but they're not of this world so they're not going to take up arms they're not going to get into your fight you mean you're for liberalism you're not a conservative you're not a conservative you're for liberalism no i'm neither i'm neither no it's not a if you're not for conservatism you're you're against caesar it's the same thing you have to pick a side you have to pick a side if you're not for us you're against us they join together to fight communism and when the true bride says communism is not my fight no i'm not for communism but communism is not my fight i'm not of this world that's a worldly fight that's not my fight i don't my that's that's i don't have a horse in that race it's not for me they joined together to fight communism and now here's an outside people that won't join with them declaring themselves to be christians but they won't join with them to fight communism that's when they'll eat their own you may have the title or be under the title of christianity but if you are not willing to fight communism with us you are an enemy to seizure and we're going to go tell them that is why pilate could look at them and say i find no fault in them i find no fault in him but take him and crucify him because i i want to keep my church i don't want my doors closed i don't want my 501 exemption done away with the pattern is laying there saints it's not going anywhere we're not going to change it you sound boy this is dreary it is kind of dreary i admit let me give you something to lighten it up verse 7 the jews answered them him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god when pilate therefore therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid but yet he never did anything about it and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer then sayeth pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee here's the silver lining in your cloud and this is the last of these other things that jesus spake before he was transformed jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin that's your consultation saints not consultation consolation that is your revelation that is your keeping power just like a pastor was preaching sunday trust is what was lost in the beginning trust is what has to be restored at the end if you don't fully trust in your heavenly father to take care of you you're going to have a rough way coming you are going to be confused you are going to you're going to be dazed you are going to have a you're going to make it but you're going to have a tough time making it and you're sure not going to be a help to your brother and sister we've got to come to full trust in our father just in our daily lives right now right now before that pressure comes before that squeeze comes right now we have to trust him in carnal things let's just be real real about it for a second if your mortgage is not paid next month that has nothing to do with your spiritual outcome correct is that going to be a comfortable thing to deal with no but it's not going to affect your spiritual outcome if you don't eat tomorrow that's not going to affect your spiritual outcome you see what i'm getting at if you say i don't see any fault in her but go ahead and crucify her that is going to affect your spiritual outcome and if you don't come to a position of full trust in your heavenly father right now the pressure that is going to come from that civil and ecclesiastical squeeze is not going to be easy it's not going to be easy period but it is it is going to stand a lot a lot greater possibility of you doing something that you would not have normally done with a proper revelation it is going that pressure that is coming has one goal it is not for your torture it is not for your punishment it is not for anything else but to make sure you have full trust in your heavenly father that's all it is because brother branham says she's not going to be killed she's not just going to be manhandled and tortured and whatever else he says he's not going to put his bride through that he's not going to do that and i've heard this preach both ends of the spectrum i mean i've heard it preached where we're eating the bark off the trees because we don't have anything to eat and i've heard it to where we're not going to face one bit of trib of persecution but there's a middle of the road and i don't know what that middle of the road is i'm being honest with you i don't have a clue i'll put it this way one of you may be eating the bark off the trees and the other one has plenty to eat there is nothing that says god has to meet each and everyone's needs by the same manner he may let one of us be eating bark off of the trees just to have the other one make sure they have a proper revelation that my heavenly father can take care of them just as well as he can take care of me you know what that person may be eating bark off of the trees and it's the best bark they've ever had it has nutrients in it that they have to have it's it it makes them live it sustains them and this person over here that we've made fun of for the last three months of hoarding up food they're eating fine because god anointed them to hoard up food but god didn't anoint that person to hoard up food so don't try to preach at his doctor that you need to hoard up food you see what i mean god can answer each individual situation different ways and it can be right and it can be completely different you can have somebody eating bark off of the trees and it sustains them just fine you could have somebody that hoarded food for three months because god spoke to them and told them lay up food or you could have somebody that didn't either and god says just speak what you want to eat today see saints let's not put them in a box and say it's got to be this way this is the way it's coming this is what this is what's going to transpire this is how god's going to fix he can do any of that and he can i mean i'm sure there's a whole other list of other things that he can do to meet each and every individual's need he may be that you go on a three-month fast you don't even need to eat i don't know i don't know how it's going to be all i know is the purpose of all of it will be tailor-made to the individual that you trust your heavenly father and you will be able to say to whatever pressure and whatever squeeze and whatever demonic form comes against you in whatever manifestation that it comes against you you can look it dead in the eye and say you have no power over me unless my father and heaven gave it to you the lamb is on the throne and the lamb is the one that calls the shots touch not this touch not that you can touch this you can touch that we need to have that proper understanding i'm not preaching to you just now saints i'm preaching to myself we better come to that proper understanding here and now in the good and in the bad it's easy to trust them when you're flowing down the stream row row row your boat it's easy to trust him that everything will be just fine but when you don't see that rock and now you're upside down do you still trust him whose fault was it that you hit the rock it was your fault because you were row row rowing your boat gently down the stream he can still meet your need he can steal he is still on the throne and he still has the power and there is no harm that can come your way even if it was your fault that you hit the rock because you hadn't prepared like you should have this is the last thing that jesus says as the musicians come before he's crucified and before he's before he's translated this is if i would say it this way this is the this is the last thing that he says to the unbelievers this is the last thing that he says to the civil and the ecclesiastical forces that have joined against him this is the last thing that jesus has said after he's went through the combine after the shuck has been completely stripped away from him he just looks at it and says you have no power over me except my father in heaven give you power i don't know about you but just me saints i want to come to that proper understanding prior to that world council of churches beating me out is the world council of churches going to come and beat the weed out yes and we may not all take the same beating you may get a little beating i may get a big beating some may get in between but we're all going to go through that combine the combine is civil is a re is a politically backed religious persecution that's all the combine is call it world council of churches call it the image to the beast cause it call it the ecumenical council call it whatever you want but at the end of the day it is a politically backed persecution that joined together to fight communism but then there was a little group that wouldn't join with them and they turned on her that's the read the church book it's explicit it's very clear that is the process and there's nothing we can do about it i just i want to say this how is the wheat going to get beat out by the combine which is the world council of churches if the wheat isn't here don't tell me that there's not something coming and don't tell me that she goes before that the wheat cannot be beat out by the world council of churches if the wheat is not there it is to what did brother branham tell us it is to separate the shock and the seed the shucks going to be there the seed is going to be there and there's going to be a separating and he says that combine is the world council of churches and he says the bride goes through the combine up into the elevator into the garner don't be trying to get to the garner if you don't go through the combine it's not going to work tell yourself that fairy tale doctrine if you want to it's not going to happen and you're going to be surprised when something blindsides you i'm not preaching this to be a doomsday or a you know whatever preacher i'm just preaching to the facts saints we don't we don't leave under this preaching under this teaching so oh this is miserable you know i got i got nothing to look forward to you know what you have to look forward to is there's a process coming that is going to rid you of every hybrid fiber of your body you say well it's not going to be enjoyable would you rather continue as you are you know what i am i keep quoting brother john i love that statement that he made he said true maturity true spiritual maturity is when you get sick of yourself that is so true but saints i am so sick of myself that if i knew where the combine was at i would go jump in it because i am so hybrid minded and it is my hybrid mind and body is has such fallacy in it that it don't even have the ability to recognize when it's right and when it's wrong there is nothing good in it the scripture says he's the father of lies the author of lies he's the murderer there's nothing good in that hybridization but it's so bad that your mind it doesn't even know whether it's right or wrong it it takes only spiritual revelation to be able to discern that but i am so sick of trying to figure out whether i'm right or i'm wrong show me where the combine's at i'm not changing what the prophet said but i want to go through this combine before i go through that combine because if i can go through this combine and judge myself as the scripture says when that civil and ecclesiastical power comes and it will come to beat the wheat out i don't want to be surprised for that process and i don't want to be having to fight that process it's not going to be pleasant it's not going to be enjoyable but it has no power over you unless god allows it to do something and what he's allowing it to do is not for your punishment it's not for your chastisement it is for you to trust him and to get rid of every hybrid fiber in your body to go into the elevator and go into the glory and the presence of god that's what i desire that's what i want and if it's an uncomfortable process to get there i still want that process because the patterns in the scripture we're not going to change the pattern it's the same pattern jesus went through it's the same thing that we have to go through we're not going to change that pattern but what i want to do is i want to recognize the antichrist spirit within my own framework each and every day i want to discern that as much as he will sovereignly allow me and i want to give him the preeminence and i want to die to myself to where when that process comes it's not such a resistance and i'm going to close with this last thing the seed goes into the ground the seed comes up through a stalk goes into a shock comes out of seed again we know this process we've heard it hundreds probably thousands of times for you old-timers when that seed comes to seed you tell me one other way that it gets into the garner without a mechanical man-made process taking effect it can't when that wheat corn whatever it is comes back to seed if there is not a man-made mechanical intervention to cut that off and to put it into the father's house it falls off and it goes right back in starts the process over or it just hangs there and rots i don't want to rot and i don't want to fall over and have 6 000 more years of this hybrid process the mechanical process is not going to be comfortable it's going to cut you away from your your shuck but it's going to put you into the garner let's stand together but let's not move forward with this false thinking that there's not a squeeze coming that there's not a politically backed persecution coming i'm not here to tell you what form that's going to come in i don't know i know what the prophet taught we can see some things but i don't know and i don't to be honest with you i don't know that i even want to know because again the process you go through is probably going to be different than the process i go through it'll have different angles it's not just going to be a cookie cutter process and like i told you whenever i told you a while back i'm not here when that's when that religious when that politically backed religious persecution comes i am not going to be the one when they close the church doors to say well i can take i can take that i can handle that what else you got i'll stick around for more no saints when i see a politically backed persecution in the smallest form i'm looking for my atoms to change i'm not here to be a tough guy i'm not here to get stuck in the combine and get ground away to dust i'm not here to bounce around in a combine have you ever seen a corn of wheat go or a air corn go through a combine it is not a fun process it's bouncing around it's going up and down and sideways in every other way it's getting belts run all over top of it they're probably the most amazing machine ever invented just by the way but i'm not here to say that feels good or i can take some more or what else you got when i see a politically backed religious persecution against the true bride of christ i'll even say it this much i don't even have to have it come my way if i see it come your way that's good enough for me that's a that fulfills the scripture i'm good to go i'm good to go take me out of here so it's not about you know preaching this way so we get tough and we resist it and no saints i'm looking for the garner but i'm not going to defy prophecy and scripture to get there i want to have a proper understanding and i want to die daily and get my shock away from me i want to have a proper revelation and say these other things now to get my shock away from me not worried about the other shock i want to get my shock away from me by saying these things and repeating these things so that i can say my doctrine is not my own it is he that sent me i am who i am by the grace of god and i am willing to do what the scriptures say i must do for my hybridization to pass off the scene if you'll play something softly let's pray together precious heavenly father we just want to thank you once again for this time that you've given us lord i've been more lengthy than i intended to be but i pray that you would just take the things that have been spoken lord would you just come and give each and every one of us the proper understanding of what we have to look forward to lord we do not have a gloomy disposition moving forward we want to move forward with a trust in our heavenly father that whatsoever you see fit to bring by our way to bring an end to this hybrid process that we would not resist that that we would not cling to ourselves but we would lay our lives down daily and we would trust in you daily to take care of us and that we would recognize and have assurance that there is no power of evil civil or ecclesiastical that has any dominion over the true bride of christ except for what the father allows and we take comfort in that lord and we believe that and we want to live a life worthy of that we want to live a life worthy of the whole gospel that you've presented to us not just the good lord but everything we thank you for the truth that you have brought to us in this day in this age and lord there are many things that we look at and we don't understand there's many things that we don't know how they're going to transpire but lord we know who is in control and we rest in that and i pray that you would just grant to me and each and every one present here tonight a more thorough understanding and revelation of that we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ thanking you once again amen god bless you let's sing something as our pastor would come [Music] it's just [Music] [Music] [Music] lord hear my prayer of your lord [Music] [Music] i've had it all but what i need is just lord [Music] praise god men have you ever seen a combine in the field you go by and you've got that big wheel it's churning beans got that big wheel it's taking it all in and dust is rolling it's loud it's noisy lots happening and everything's coming in and getting all mixed up and but you ever seen it shooting out all of the shock and all the stalk out back it stays on earth all of that stays on earth but then all that wheat that was separated from one another all that wheat that stood and you know stood on the stalk and still stood in what dry part of the chuck remain and stood over here and stood over there it all gets brought together and all gets lifted to the same place amen and by the time you you start through the process there's all kinds of dirt and dust and shuck and stalk and all kinds of stuff mixed together but by the time you get to the process all the weed is gathered to one place in perfect fellowship perfect harmony perfect week together that's what i'm longing for friends that's what we long for to be gathered to the father's garner where you and i amen will have perfect fellowship because there's nothing else separating us have fellowship with all the other elect seed of god because there's nothing else separating us we've been all brought back home again to the father's house say praise god how many just want to surrender more have it in your heart just i want to surrender more lord i i want to lay in the presence of the son i want to bake all the greenness out i want to come to maturity i want to be able to say those other things and not say it in the flesh and not say it by repeating somebody else but i want your spirit speaking your word through me so there's no self-declaration but i'm only declaring your word amen until we can die to ourselves and only do the father's will we're we're not lifting up we're not declaring ourselves do we when you say what the word says it's not in a measure of self-declaration for self-glorification but all we're doing is exalting him because he has said and he has done he has declared by spiritual revelation i know this to be true amen because of the father it's not us we didn't do it he did it all i don't want by self-declaration to say these other things i just want to speak the word i want to speak it from a pure heart and i want that word to have life-giving power to some other seed that out there that's ready yet to come to life amen i think we can surrender i think we can surrender more i think we want to surrender more amen let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing over the word tonight as we go lord jesus we thank you god for the reminder you've given us tonight and we thank you for using lord the vessel of our brother to speak to us and god may we enjoy the word that you've given us the revelation the understanding may it take all fear away lord because it's an expression of your love your revelation by peeling back the mystery by telling us before when you told your disciples before so that when these things happen they would know it was an expression of your love for them and when you tell us before it's an expression of your love showing us who we are and that our destination is secure and that you've never lost sight of us and know there's no weapon formed against us that can destroy us nothing can have power over us unless you first approve it lord and you've told us this before to show your love so that love will have an effect because perfect love will cast out all fear and you've told us these things lord by identifying who we are in our position and the age we live in and what the prophet has told us about the end time events lord not to create fear but to show your love lord to bring us to an expected end amen to dispel all fear now we surrender to you in this perfect love that you already have a plan and your plan is perfect just as perfect as it was when any of your believers ever walked this earth is just as perfect today you have a plan and you have a purpose and we're yielding to that purpose lord and trusting in your plan we're declaring afresh tonight that we trust you lord i pray you take us and use us for your glory as we leave here tonight lord may the things we've heard not fade away but may they become more real to us day by day as we surrender lord and all of self is baked out and all the immaturity and selfishness is gone maybe just reflect your life more and more and trust you more carry us home safely lord use us for your glory we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen when jesus went through his trial and his persecution his crucifixion and his death he went through all that for redemption he went through all that for love [Music] and if we have to go through a little bit of a a trial a little squeeze what will it produce the fullness of redemption and that's what i'm looking for in this day is the fullness of redemption amen god bless you god be with you as you go amen let's sing brother ben here i am [Music] myself to the lord here i am [Music] let your spirit [Music] me [Music] i give all myself to the lord here i am [Music] let your spirit move
