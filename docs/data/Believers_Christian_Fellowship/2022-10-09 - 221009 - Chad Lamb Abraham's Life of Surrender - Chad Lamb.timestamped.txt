[19:24] I love doing baby dedications
[19:28] amen we've had plenty of practice lately
[19:31] praise the Lord I hope we keep the trend
[19:33] up so there's there's 12 months in the
[19:37] year there's no reason why we can't have
[19:38] 12 babies and 12 baby dedications
[19:41] so
[19:42] praise God let's turn to Romans 4 while
[19:44] we're standing
[19:49] Romans chapter 4.
[20:00] and I think we'll read just from verse
[20:02] three just one scripture
[20:05] Romans chapter 4 verse 3 for what saith
[20:08] the scripture Abraham believed God and
[20:11] was counted unto him for righteousness
[20:13] amen God bless you as you have your
[20:16] seats
[20:18] just like to draw there that Abraham
[20:20] believed God and that was so key because
[20:22] Abraham was the father of Faith amen he
[20:25] is the uh we are children of Abraham by
[20:28] faith he's father of the royal seed and
[20:31] and so Abraham believed God and was
[20:34] counted him for righteousness that's not
[20:36] the the main thrust of my subject but I
[20:39] want to start there with Abraham
[20:40] believing God because his actions were
[20:43] based on his faith and I want to talk
[20:45] this morning on Abraham's life of
[20:47] surrender the prophet of God says in the
[20:50] message Faith from 1956 he said now
[20:52] we're speaking tonight upon faith and I
[20:54] thought it would be nice maybe if we
[20:56] would use this great character of
[20:58] Abraham for an example of Faith because
[21:00] it was to Abraham the promise was given
[21:03] and we'll kind of review the life of
[21:05] Abraham just a little because he was an
[21:08] outstanding character and he was a man
[21:09] who believed God and now he had no great
[21:12] background to believe God because it's
[21:14] commonly believed that he was from a
[21:16] family of idolaters he came to down from
[21:18] Babylon his family dwelt in their land
[21:21] of chaudia the city of Earth the valley
[21:23] of shinar and was just an ordinary man
[21:26] he wasn't no angel he was just a man
[21:28] like you and I and God looking over the
[21:31] Earth to see for men that he could put
[21:33] confidence in that would believe him
[21:35] regardless of circumstances he found
[21:37] Abraham and called Abraham by election
[21:40] so brother Venom said that he wanted to
[21:43] use Abraham because Abraham was an
[21:44] outstanding character and and brother
[21:47] random preached a lot about Abraham and
[21:49] we've preached a lot about Abraham he's
[21:51] he's the father of Faith he is a an
[21:54] outstanding figure he received the
[21:57] promise of God without condition
[22:00] there was a covenant with Abraham the
[22:02] abrahamic Covenant was an unconditional
[22:04] Covenant where God wasn't going to say
[22:06] any longer if you'll do this I'll do
[22:08] this but he says I will I will make of
[22:11] you a great nation I will give you the
[22:12] land and so we we are by faith Abraham's
[22:16] seed and part of that unconditional
[22:18] Covenant so it means so much to us and
[22:21] so I've preached on Abraham before but I
[22:24] just love I love the life of Abraham and
[22:27] as we look into it it just struck me
[22:28] differently this time there was
[22:30] something I was mooling over in my heart
[22:32] and as I I read through his life again
[22:34] it just had impact on me if we could
[22:37] turn to Genesis 11 I just want to look
[22:40] at the life of Abraham in a few places
[22:48] Genesis chapter 11.
[22:56] in verse 31.
[23:03] we're going to bounce around from
[23:04] scriptures but we're going to follow the
[23:06] life of Abraham through Genesis here and
[23:08] in Genesis 11 31 it says and Tara took
[23:12] Abraham his son and lot his son the son
[23:15] of Heron his son's son son and Sarai his
[23:18] daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and
[23:21] they went forth with them from Irv the
[23:23] childish to go into the land of Canaan
[23:25] and they came unto Heron and dwelt there
[23:27] and the days of Terror were 205 years
[23:30] and Tara died in Heron let's go over to
[23:33] chapter 12 verse 1 now the Lord had said
[23:36] unto Abram get thee out of the country
[23:38] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[23:40] Father's House unto a land that I will
[23:42] show show thee and I will make of thee a
[23:45] great nation and I will bless thee and
[23:47] make thy name great and thou shalt be
[23:50] blessed and I will bless them that bless
[23:52] thee and curse them that curseth thee
[23:54] and indeed shall all families of the
[23:56] earth be blessed now if you go back to
[23:58] verse 1 it says and the Lord said unto
[24:00] Abram the Lord had said to Abram and
[24:04] brother Branham I love the way brother
[24:05] Branham reads the Bible amen he this is
[24:08] a man who who doesn't have a high level
[24:11] of Education no Seminary experience God
[24:14] called him amen and just a young man and
[24:16] he had very limited education in fact
[24:19] when he started off reading he couldn't
[24:21] even read his Bible in front of the
[24:22] congregation he would have he would have
[24:24] his fiancee read it or he'd have another
[24:26] Minister read it because he wasn't that
[24:28] much confident reading in public amen
[24:30] but he could read the Bible correctly
[24:33] even though he didn't have the education
[24:36] to read it smoothly amen he read it
[24:39] correctly and he could see here the Lord
[24:41] had said unto Abram he had said
[24:43] something to Abram previous to this he
[24:46] had already told him to leave his
[24:48] Kindred to leave his homeland and go
[24:50] into a land so if we back up to verse 31
[24:53] again we know that Abraham has already
[24:55] been instructed to leave his Kindred and
[24:58] leave his home but it says in 31 that
[25:00] Tara which is Abram's father
[25:03] took his son Abram and and lot the son
[25:06] of Heron his son son and Sarah his wife
[25:09] or his daughter-in-law the son of
[25:11] Abram's wife and they went forth with
[25:13] them from Ur of the childish to go into
[25:15] the land of Canaan look where they're
[25:17] going they're going to Canaan who got
[25:20] the Commandment to go to Canaan Abram
[25:22] got the Commandment to go to Canaan and
[25:24] he was told to leave his Kindred leave
[25:26] his home and go to Canaan so now you
[25:28] realize that that brother Ben was going
[25:31] to tell us that he took his daddy along
[25:33] he took a lot of long he didn't fully
[25:35] obey God because he was supposed to
[25:37] leave Kindred and supposed to leave land
[25:39] but when he got the commission to go to
[25:41] Canaan all of a sudden he must have
[25:43] expressed it somehow to his father and
[25:45] his father took over and it says Tara
[25:49] took Abram
[25:51] amen Tara took Abram and they they were
[25:55] going on their way to Canaan which isn't
[25:57] exactly what God had told him it's a
[26:00] little bit of a deviation from the truth
[26:03] but they're going to Canaan they're
[26:04] going in the right direction and you can
[26:06] see how Abram Abraham when we look at
[26:09] this life I want to look at how Abraham
[26:12] was learning and how Abraham taught him
[26:14] because in every Junction in life God
[26:17] confirms the promise to Abram even
[26:19] though Abram's not fully there yet
[26:23] amen and it so matches our life because
[26:25] we're learning as we go amen none of us
[26:28] want to go back and live the level we
[26:30] were at four or five years ago nobody
[26:32] wants to go back amen we we look back
[26:35] and we realize that wasn't exactly right
[26:37] I didn't have exactly the right attitude
[26:39] my motive was a little questionable on
[26:41] that and I don't want to go back to
[26:42] those days I want to keep pressing
[26:44] forward and be more christ-like and we
[26:46] can see the way God let Abraham it's
[26:49] very much the way God leads us amen
[26:51] although there was some mistakes
[26:53] although there were some wrong motives
[26:55] and maybe wrong desires or wrong
[26:57] attitudes God still dealt with us
[27:00] we were believing God Amen and and it
[27:04] says Abraham believed God he believed
[27:06] what God told him he believed it enough
[27:08] to share it with his family he believed
[27:10] it enough he had to go to Canaan but
[27:12] when he shared it with his father his
[27:14] father took over and Tara took Abram and
[27:18] law and come up to the land
[27:20] and and Abram was probably happy
[27:25] I don't know but happy that his dad had
[27:28] caught the same vision and lot had
[27:29] caught the same vision he was believing
[27:31] God but not fully realizing the extent
[27:34] of what God meant by leave thy Kindred
[27:36] and leave thy family
[27:39] and we know I love when brother bam says
[27:41] this in faith he was just an ordinary
[27:44] man
[27:45] he was just a man like you and I amen so
[27:49] it's so easy now to go back and place
[27:52] yourself in Abraham's shoes as he was
[27:54] Abram at this time to place yourself
[27:56] there amen and realize I I look back on
[28:00] the story and realize Abraham was wrong
[28:02] amen but maybe Abram didn't realize he
[28:04] was wrong or he didn't realize how wrong
[28:06] he was but he's just happy he heard from
[28:08] the Lord he's happy that he's going on
[28:10] with God
[28:12] so they travel they begin to leave their
[28:15] Homeland in the south of Mesopotamia and
[28:18] ER and they move north because they're
[28:21] following the Fertile Crescent they go
[28:22] north in Mesopotamia and curve around
[28:24] and come down into the land of Canaan
[28:27] and as they're moving North they go up
[28:29] to Heron which is very much North and
[28:31] towards the West they're moving to
[28:33] Canaan and when they get to Heron they
[28:36] stop there and that's where Tara dies
[28:40] and it says verse 32 and the days of
[28:43] Terror were 205 years and Tara died in
[28:47] Heron he didn't go all the way into
[28:49] Canaan he died along the journey and and
[28:52] when you look back at this you realize
[28:54] that was the grace of God
[28:58] maybe Abraham was devastated maybe
[29:00] Abraham was heartbroken I don't know
[29:01] what his response would have been but
[29:04] that was the grace of God because God
[29:06] needed Abraham separated unto himself to
[29:09] fulfill the promise in his life and when
[29:11] Abram decided to go along and take Dad
[29:14] and and others with them amen God had to
[29:17] begin to bring a separation because
[29:19] Abraham was still young Abraham was
[29:21] still immature Abraham was still
[29:22] learning so God in his mercy and Grace
[29:25] brought the separation and it was no
[29:28] doubt it was hurtful to Abram but it was
[29:30] needful for Abraham and then God Amen
[29:33] from here Abraham goes on without his
[29:36] father so we read that in in verse one
[29:39] so let's drop down to verse 4.
[29:44] verse 4 so Abram departed as the Lord
[29:47] had spoken unto him and lot went with
[29:49] him and Abram was 70 and 5 years old
[29:52] when he departed out of heron
[29:55] brother Ram said in Jehovah Jireh said
[29:58] now Abram started off he had trouble as
[30:00] long as his daddy was with him the old
[30:02] fellow died then he took his nephew and
[30:05] as long as lot was along there was
[30:06] trouble God said separate yourself walk
[30:09] alone with him that's the way God wants
[30:11] you to do separate yourself from all
[30:13] unbelief and walk alone with God
[30:17] so he goes now Tara's been separated he
[30:21] now he goes on with lot
[30:24] and it says in verse 5 and Abram took
[30:27] Sarah his wife and lot his brother's son
[30:29] and all their substance that they had
[30:31] gathered and the souls that they had
[30:33] gotten in heroin and they went forth to
[30:35] go into the land of Canaan into the land
[30:37] of Canaan they came and Abram passed
[30:40] through the land unto the place of
[30:42] psychum Unto the place of Mora and the
[30:45] Canaanite was then in the land and the
[30:48] Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto
[30:50] thy seed will I give this land and there
[30:53] build it he an altar unto the Lord who
[30:55] appeared unto him and he removed from
[30:57] thence into a mountain on the east of
[30:59] Bethel and pitched his tent having
[31:01] Bethel in the west and hay I own the
[31:03] East and there he builded an altar unto
[31:05] the Lord and called upon the name of the
[31:07] Lord and Abram journeyed going still
[31:09] toward the South
[31:11] so here
[31:12] Abram moves into the land and when he
[31:15] moves into the land he's still not in
[31:18] perfect obedience to the word is that
[31:20] right he still has a lot along with him
[31:23] he's still not made a total separation
[31:25] and as soon as he moves into the land
[31:27] God Appears to him and confirms a
[31:30] promise that he's going to give a seed
[31:31] and going to give the land to the seed
[31:33] and and and we think sometimes in our
[31:35] mind amen once we see somebody not in
[31:38] perfect submission not in a perfect walk
[31:40] not in a perfect way Hey listen God
[31:42] knows how to deal with his children amen
[31:44] and let God deal with his children
[31:46] because here Abram is not in a perfect
[31:48] submission he's not in complete
[31:50] obedience amen but because he's moving
[31:52] in the right direction we know that
[31:54] Abram believed God Amen he believed God
[31:57] but he didn't quite amen have a full
[31:59] comprehension he wasn't in full
[32:01] obedience but he believed God and as he
[32:04] moved God moved with him and when he
[32:06] made a step God met him in that step
[32:08] amen amen and the kid for us is just to
[32:11] keep moving obey gone but believe God
[32:13] and what you see and tell you to do do
[32:15] it amen and we look back and say I got
[32:18] it wrong there and I got it wrong there
[32:19] and I got it wrong there but when you
[32:21] were there you were doing the best you
[32:23] knew how to do
[32:24] you believed God and you were living for
[32:26] him and you realize now there was a
[32:28] little something wrong back there and
[32:30] there was a little something wrong in
[32:31] this situation amen but because you were
[32:34] a child of God and you believed God when
[32:36] you moved God met you amen God confirmed
[32:38] a promise he healed you he he did all
[32:41] kinds of things for us he worked in
[32:42] Supernatural ways amen so there's never
[32:45] a time to stop we must keep growing and
[32:48] keep going and come into perfect faith
[32:50] and perfect obedience into a perfect
[32:52] life
[32:53] but all along the way God is with us
[32:57] God called Abram he didn't call him to
[33:01] leave him he didn't call him to ditch
[33:03] him he didn't call him to say oh that's
[33:05] your first mistake strike one you're
[33:07] gone he called him because he had a
[33:09] purpose for Abram he knew what Abraham's
[33:11] destination was what his purpose was and
[33:14] and as Abram moved and grew and
[33:16] increased amen God was with him all
[33:18] along and God confirmed the promise and
[33:20] then confirmed it again and then
[33:22] confirmed it again
[33:24] I love looking at the life of Abram
[33:26] because all of a sudden our life begins
[33:28] to make sense
[33:30] if we look now
[33:33] I want to read to you uh out of Romans
[33:36] chapter four keep your place here in
[33:37] Genesis we'll come back but I want to
[33:39] look at two scriptures
[33:40] Romans chapter 4.
[33:47] and then we'll go to Hebrews 11 Romans
[33:49] chapter 4.
[33:51] verse 12.
[33:54] describing Abraham
[33:57] Romans 4 and 12 and the father of
[33:59] circumcision to them who are not of the
[34:01] circumcision only but who also walk on
[34:04] the steps of the Faith of Our Father
[34:05] Abraham which he had being yet
[34:08] uncircumcised So This Promise is not
[34:11] only for the Jew for the circumcised
[34:13] it's for the uncircumcision or the
[34:15] non-jew as well as long as they walk in
[34:17] the steps of the Faith of Our Father
[34:19] Abraham
[34:20] for the promise that he should be heir
[34:22] of the world was not to Abram or to his
[34:24] seed through the law but through the
[34:26] righteousness of faith for they which
[34:29] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[34:31] void in the promise made of non-effect
[34:33] because the law worketh wrath for there
[34:36] is no law there is no transgression
[34:38] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[34:40] by grace to the end the promise might be
[34:42] sure to all the seed not to that only
[34:45] which is of the law but that also which
[34:48] is of the faith of Abraham who is the
[34:50] father of us all
[34:52] Abraham is Our Father Abraham is our
[34:55] example of Faith amen and we see his
[34:57] walk of faith and you see him grow in
[35:00] his walk of faith and grow in his
[35:01] understanding that he is our father and
[35:04] we must walk in the footsteps of his
[35:05] faith let's look at Hebrews 11 together
[35:12] Hebrews 11 and 8.
[35:20] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[35:23] go out into a place which he should
[35:24] after receive for inheritance obeyed and
[35:27] he went out not knowing whether he went
[35:29] I love the scripture
[35:32] because the critical mind that amongst
[35:34] us would say well he didn't completely
[35:35] obey but what God saw what was in
[35:38] Abraham's heart he believed God and he
[35:40] obeyed did he get it partially wrong yes
[35:43] amen did it cause him trouble yes did
[35:45] there have to come a further separation
[35:47] absolutely but when Hebrews was looking
[35:49] at the faith of Abraham in the heart of
[35:51] Abraham it said when Abraham when he was
[35:54] called to go out into a place which he
[35:55] should have to receive for inheritance
[35:57] obeyed
[35:59] it didn't matter what anybody else
[36:01] thought about the way Abraham did it
[36:03] what matters is right here what God
[36:04] thinks Abraham obeyed God Amen and when
[36:07] God needed him to go a little further
[36:09] God knew how to take him a little bit
[36:11] further but Abraham believed God and he
[36:14] obeyed God and he was moving by faith
[36:19] amen amen amen
[36:22] in Colossians 3 1 it says if you then be
[36:25] risen with Christ seek those things
[36:27] which are above where Christ sitteth on
[36:29] the right hand of God set your
[36:31] affections on thing above not on things
[36:33] of the earth if you go back and read
[36:35] Hebrews 11 read the next scripture that
[36:38] we didn't read Hebrews 11 let's read
[36:41] verse 9 by faith he's sojourned in the
[36:43] land of promises in a strange country
[36:45] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[36:47] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[36:49] promise for he looked for a city which
[36:52] hath foundations whose Builder and maker
[36:54] is God
[36:56] now we know what Abraham was looking for
[36:59] he was looking for the Heavenly City
[37:02] he wasn't looking for Earthly things he
[37:04] wasn't lurking to established something
[37:05] on Earth an Earthly City an Earthly home
[37:08] he was looking for a Heavenly Home a
[37:10] city not made with hands that has
[37:12] foundations whose Builder and maker was
[37:14] gone amen and Paul tells us that if if
[37:17] we'd be risen with Christ we seek those
[37:19] things which are above amen not those
[37:22] things
[37:23] is that your affection on things above
[37:25] not things on the earth we're going to
[37:28] see this is Abraham's life
[37:30] and it needs to be let's go back to
[37:32] Genesis 13.
[37:37] so Hebrews 11 says Abraham when he was
[37:40] called out he obeyed
[37:43] we with uh the understanding we have
[37:46] will say well he obeyed but he kind of
[37:48] obeyed God said he obeyed
[37:51] he was be he was the father of Faith he
[37:54] was believing God and he was acting on
[37:56] his faith did he get a a little part
[37:58] wrong he got a little part wrong amen
[38:00] but we have a heavenly father who
[38:02] watches over us and he knows the
[38:04] destination and he will make sure we get
[38:07] there and we get there right amen
[38:10] and so he first God removes Terror from
[38:13] the equation amen and it wasn't it
[38:16] wasn't Abraham's free choice to separate
[38:18] from his father that was the mercy and
[38:20] grace of God Amen
[38:22] and I want to go back to that in a
[38:24] minute but let's read this first and
[38:25] we'll go to that
[38:27] Genesis 13 5.
[38:29] and lot also which went with Abram had
[38:32] flocks and herds and Tents and the land
[38:34] was not able to Bear them that they
[38:36] might dwell together for their substance
[38:38] was great so that they could not dwell
[38:40] together and there was a Strife between
[38:42] the Herdman Abram's cattle and the
[38:44] Herdman of lots cattle and the Canaanite
[38:46] and the parasite dwelt in the land and
[38:48] Abram said unto lot let there be no
[38:50] Strife I pray thee between me and thee
[38:53] and between my herdmen and thy Herdman
[38:54] for we be Brethren it's not the whole
[38:57] land before thee separate separate
[39:00] thyself I pray thee from me
[39:03] if that will take the left hand then I
[39:05] will go to the right or thou depart to
[39:07] the right then I will go to the left
[39:11] now God knows that Abraham needs a
[39:15] greater separation
[39:17] Abraham may not realize it amen but God
[39:21] realizes now Abraham's not walking in
[39:24] unbelief even though he's in partial
[39:25] Disobedience because he believed God he
[39:28] obeyed God but not fully but he's not
[39:30] not with a heart of unbelief but God
[39:33] knows there needs to be a greater
[39:35] separation amen and even allows Abraham
[39:38] to fail because when God told him to go
[39:40] to the land he wanted him to stay in the
[39:42] land of Canaan but where did they get so
[39:45] much substance and where did they get so
[39:47] rich that the land couldn't contain them
[39:49] they had to separate they got it down in
[39:51] Egypt how did they get to Egypt because
[39:53] a famine hit the land and Abraham did
[39:55] what God told him not to do he left
[39:57] Canaan and went down into Egypt
[40:01] is it wrong it was wrong was it right it
[40:04] worked out right
[40:05] because they were increased and he left
[40:07] Egypt exceedingly wealthy and golden and
[40:09] silver and servants and in cattle amen
[40:12] and lot had abundance too and now the
[40:14] land couldn't contain him what's God
[40:16] doing he now God is using Prosperity
[40:19] Amen to bring division
[40:22] God had allowed them to go and come back
[40:25] wealthy so that he can create a
[40:27] situation of tension amen and you think
[40:30] how it's so terrible that they love each
[40:32] other so much and now there's tension in
[40:34] their herdmen There's A disruption in
[40:36] the Harmony in the family and now
[40:38] Abraham's going to make a proposition to
[40:40] lot amen you separate from me Let there
[40:43] not be Strife you go one way I'll go the
[40:45] other way if you take the right I'll
[40:47] take the left and Abram's acting like a
[40:50] gentleman through it all amen and God is
[40:52] going to reward Abraham for his attitude
[40:54] but it's God who set up the situation
[40:56] because Abraham needed to more fully
[40:59] obey the word amen and whether he was
[41:01] blind or not I don't know but I know he
[41:04] believed God
[41:06] he believed God and God counted it to
[41:09] him for righteousness even when he was
[41:11] not completely obeying
[41:14] praise be to God
[41:16] I I look back on my life and say if God
[41:19] can do that for Abraham he's done it for
[41:20] me I know he's done it for me he blessed
[41:23] me in answering my prayers and I know
[41:25] that I wasn't fully lined up to the word
[41:27] there was things in my life that weren't
[41:29] right amen but I was believing God and
[41:31] doing what I believe to be right and God
[41:33] was dealing with me all along amen it's
[41:36] not like God just took a newborn baby
[41:38] Christian you come to the word and all
[41:40] of a sudden he's got these expectations
[41:42] that if you don't meet him all he won't
[41:43] deal with you anymore
[41:45] he's looking at your faith he's looking
[41:47] at what you believe and he's looking at
[41:48] what you're doing and why you're doing
[41:50] it
[41:51] I'm so thankful amen he creates
[41:54] situations that will cause growth
[41:57] and we look at these situations and
[42:00] sometimes these situations they cause
[42:02] turmoil within us and they we get upset
[42:04] and we get bent out of shape and we can
[42:07] even become offended amen we can get
[42:10] upset at people Abram could have easily
[42:13] got upset at the herdsmen of law then he
[42:15] could have got to say a lot for not
[42:16] dealing with this herd man he could have
[42:18] I there's all kinds of ways that Abram
[42:21] could react into the situation wrong
[42:23] amen but he just yielded to the
[42:25] situation and he said separate from me I
[42:28] pray you go one way I'll go the other
[42:30] let there not be Strife Among Us
[42:35] and Abraham was always willing to
[42:39] surrender this is what I want to start
[42:40] getting into
[42:42] Abraham was always willing to surrender
[42:45] God said leave the land he left the land
[42:49] when God took his father he moved on to
[42:52] the land without his father
[42:54] when the situation came up with lot and
[42:56] lot needed to separate he let lot go
[42:59] Abraham's Life we'll see we keep
[43:02] watching becomes a life of surrender
[43:05] to the will of God becomes a life of
[43:09] surrendering to the plan of God
[43:12] and
[43:13] and I want that to be my life
[43:19] I wrote down something
[43:21] that just struck me it said sometimes
[43:23] surrender is not a choice
[43:27] because Tara leaving was not Abraham's
[43:30] choice
[43:33] the situation that caused lot to
[43:35] separate it wasn't as if Abraham all of
[43:38] a sudden realized you know what I need a
[43:40] total separation I need to separate from
[43:43] a lot no God allowed circumstances to
[43:45] come to where they needed to separate
[43:49] so sometimes the surrender is not a
[43:52] premeditated choice not we see a
[43:54] situation and I make this Choice
[43:56] sometimes that's not the surrender
[43:58] sometimes it is you see the will of God
[44:00] you've got to make a choice you
[44:01] surrender and you make the choice but
[44:03] sometimes God has made the choice for
[44:06] you
[44:08] and we need to surrender to God's choice
[44:18] it's sometimes not a choice we make
[44:22] before
[44:24] a situation
[44:26] or a separation
[44:28] but surrender is a choice we make after
[44:34] it's a choice we make to yield to the
[44:37] circumstances
[44:40] not to become hurt or offended
[44:45] not and not to allow any bitterness in
[44:48] our heart
[44:51] see
[44:52] God was putting Abraham in a condition
[44:55] where he can bring about the promise in
[44:58] his life
[44:59] these things were for Abraham's good
[45:02] this was this was God fulfilling his
[45:04] purpose and planting Abraham but none of
[45:07] us want to lose a father there's there's
[45:10] no way that Abraham lost his father Tara
[45:12] and said well that's a good thing praise
[45:14] God I'm sure he was heartbroken I'm sure
[45:16] it hurt I'm sure he missed his father
[45:18] but he had to move on in the plan of God
[45:20] and bury him there inherent and he had
[45:22] to go on to Canaan without him and that
[45:24] was God's mercy to Abraham to get
[45:27] Abraham in a condition for the promise
[45:31] nobody wants to lose somebody nobody
[45:34] wants Strife nobody wants their herdsmen
[45:37] striving with their brethren
[45:39] right nobody wants difficult situations
[45:42] nobody wants fusses and fights nobody
[45:45] wants a hard situations the Apostle Paul
[45:48] did not want a thorn in his flesh
[45:51] that was not his choice that was the
[45:53] choice of God who knew what Paul needed
[45:55] so that he wouldn't become puffed up so
[45:57] they could in humility and Minister the
[45:58] word and God Did It for Paul and God Did
[46:01] It for the people that would hear Paul
[46:02] Paul didn't want it amen but once he
[46:05] realized it was the will of God he
[46:07] surrendered himself to it it was not
[46:09] angry about it was not bitter over it
[46:11] did not get hurt till God towards God
[46:13] Amen all of a sudden he began to glory
[46:16] in his he said now therefore glory in my
[46:18] infirmities for when I'm weak then am I
[46:21] made strong
[46:23] bomb began to learn to to to yield and
[46:26] even brother Benham he had a problem
[46:28] with tension all of his life amen and
[46:30] there towards the latter part of his
[46:32] ministry he said you know this tension's
[46:34] bothering me all of my life I get the
[46:36] blues I get the feeling like nobody
[46:38] loves me and I know that's not the truth
[46:40] that's just me doing that and he starts
[46:42] to describe the tension that he gets
[46:43] under and the anxiety and and the
[46:46] depression that he goes through and he
[46:48] starts to explain this amen and then he
[46:50] says but I got to thinking about this
[46:52] tension it's this tension that drove me
[46:54] to Christ
[46:56] he said what would I be without tension
[46:59] he said it's good for me
[47:02] instead of cursing the thing and getting
[47:05] upset about it and getting angry amen he
[47:08] began to realize that God was using this
[47:11] for me
[47:12] this is a blessing of God it drove me to
[47:15] Christ it keeps me dependent on Christ
[47:17] amen it keeps it keeps us in the right
[47:20] State of Mind many times and and I've
[47:22] seen so many times where people go
[47:24] through very difficult situations very
[47:27] difficult family situations difficult
[47:29] marriage situations a difficult work
[47:32] situation whatever kind of situation
[47:34] Church situations
[47:35] and you realize after talking to him for
[47:38] a little while they're hurt
[47:40] but they're hurt towards God
[47:44] because they said God could have
[47:45] prevented it God could have stopped it
[47:47] why could God allow it to happen why why
[47:50] am I going through this and why is this
[47:52] happening in my life and they're hurt
[47:54] over the situation but the more you talk
[47:56] to them to realize they're actually hurt
[47:58] at God Amen and there's a little bit of
[48:01] hurt they're harboring towards the
[48:03] almighty God because they know God could
[48:05] have stopped it God could have prevented
[48:07] it and I don't understand why God
[48:08] allowed it and I just want to I want to
[48:10] live the life of Abraham and say God
[48:12] allowed it for my purpose there's some
[48:15] benefit in it somewhere I'm not going to
[48:17] be hurt at God I'm not going to be
[48:18] offended at God I won't be a hurt or
[48:20] offended towards my brethren I'll just
[48:22] recognize that God is working something
[48:24] in my life and I needed another layer of
[48:27] separation
[48:31] man we have to be so careful about our
[48:34] attitude
[48:35] towards situations
[48:38] Abraham he in every will watch as we go
[48:43] but in every Junction he surrendered
[48:46] he surrendered he surrendered he
[48:49] surrendered and I want to surrender when
[48:52] things are happening I just want to
[48:54] yield to what God is allowing not
[48:56] accepting the devil's lie not except not
[48:59] living below my privileges and no way
[49:01] will I ever forsake or deny my Divine
[49:03] Healing my right to Healing that was
[49:05] purchased at Calvary I'll never deny
[49:07] amen that I have a deliverer that will
[49:09] deliver me from every situation but if
[49:12] God is allowing something and this is
[49:14] for His glory and for my benefit I don't
[49:16] want to take a wrong attitude towards
[49:18] people or a wrong attitude towards The
[49:21] God Who permitted it to happen
[49:24] I remember I've prayed before as a young
[49:26] Christian I would be sick or have a
[49:28] situation that was Troublesome and I
[49:31] said God why are you allowing this you
[49:33] could stop it so easy anybody else have
[49:36] those prayers I would even pray God one
[49:38] twitch of your finger I remember praying
[49:40] this one time one twitch of your finger
[49:42] be over why won't you twitch your finger
[49:47] I hope I'm not the only one who's prayed
[49:49] like that
[49:50] but I really heartfelt I knew it was
[49:54] this was a non-issue for God this was
[49:56] this was easy this was it could be
[49:59] resolved it could be over with and a
[50:01] fraction of a second and a moment of
[50:03] time but God was permitting it and I
[50:05] didn't understand why he was permitting
[50:06] it
[50:08] but now I look back and I thank God he
[50:10] permitted those things because I learned
[50:12] to trust him amen I learned to walk in
[50:14] his word I learned to have faith even
[50:16] when things didn't happen instantly I
[50:19] learned to trust in God and I learned
[50:21] that the word Works in every situation
[50:24] those things that I thought were killing
[50:25] me were setting me free
[50:29] the prophet of God says and the message
[50:31] shalom
[50:33] it says many people ask why
[50:35] they asked they asked sometimes they ask
[50:38] me why why must these things happen
[50:41] why why did this happen to me why did I
[50:44] start and this happened and had this
[50:46] trouble here
[50:47] and this upset me here
[50:49] and I lost this here
[50:51] sometimes I've asked why why when I was
[50:54] just a young Minister first started out
[50:56] did God take my wife right out from
[50:59] under me
[51:00] take my baby right from beneath me right
[51:03] beneath my heart
[51:06] why did he do that I didn't know I do
[51:09] now
[51:11] I just held my hand in his and kept
[51:14] trusting
[51:16] remember brother Venom his wife died
[51:19] young wife died of tuberculosis eighth
[51:21] month eight month old baby died of of
[51:24] meningitis I believe it was in the
[51:26] hospital he come to her crib suffering
[51:29] so bad her eyes were crossed and asking
[51:31] God and and just begging God for her
[51:34] healing is looking down at her begging
[51:37] of God he seen God at this point heal he
[51:39] knew God was a Healer he knew God could
[51:43] change the situation in a moment and he
[51:45] looked down at her suffering so bad her
[51:47] little eyes were crossed amen and he
[51:49] asked God to please heal her and he said
[51:51] like a black sheep come down he wouldn't
[51:53] hear my prayer
[51:56] he said I didn't understand it
[51:59] then he goes I do now
[52:04] and brother Brown tells his life story
[52:06] there's one version of the lifestyle I
[52:08] don't remember which one he tells it
[52:10] several places but there's one at the
[52:12] end he just starts crying and he and
[52:14] he's emotional he says I'm sorry I just
[52:16] can't go on that's all I can tell now
[52:18] and the man was heartbroken the man
[52:20] lived through tragedy through heartache
[52:23] amen but you never saw him get bitter
[52:26] towards God
[52:28] and you never saw him get upset towards
[52:31] other people amen even his mother-in-law
[52:33] amen his mother-in-law was the one who
[52:35] chastised him for wanting to go out
[52:37] amongst the Pentecostals and and she
[52:39] rebuked him and said you'll not drag my
[52:41] daughter out amongst that rubbish and
[52:43] and he hurricane hearkened under her
[52:45] voice and and he didn't go out amen and
[52:48] that's why all of these troubles came to
[52:50] him is because he refused to go out when
[52:52] God first called him out and God Amen
[52:54] allowed all of this stuff to happen into
[52:56] his life and he recognized it when he
[52:58] was in a boat Amen in a flood trying to
[53:00] rescue people and the engine wouldn't
[53:02] start and he's pulling and pulling and
[53:04] it won't start and he's heading for the
[53:06] falls and he said God whatever I've done
[53:08] I'll make it right and he realized it
[53:10] didn't go out and he let his
[53:11] mother-in-law persuade him away
[53:16] and finally he repented and said he'll
[53:18] make it right and the engine started and
[53:20] he went off but you never saw brother
[53:22] Branham get bitter towards his
[53:23] mother-in-law
[53:25] you never hear him speak evil about her
[53:27] amen was it her fault yeah it was
[53:30] partially her fault it was her influence
[53:32] it was her hard nature but brother Madam
[53:34] took the blame upon himself and then he
[53:37] even realized I didn't understand why
[53:39] but now I understand why it had to be
[53:42] this way it was needful that it would be
[53:45] this way and now there's no bitterness
[53:47] there's no anger there's nothing to be
[53:49] upset about
[53:53] he said I just put my hand in his and
[53:55] kept trusting
[53:57] he knows every Junction
[53:59] he knows the Rhythm when it must take
[54:02] place he knows what it takes to mold you
[54:05] he knows what kind of material he's
[54:07] going to use see the back side of the
[54:10] desert sometimes where God molds
[54:12] righteous men into sages and prophecy
[54:14] that's where men are beat out men are
[54:16] beat out in the in the word when they
[54:19] got all kind of creed and stuff in them
[54:21] let them come to the word and God beats
[54:23] it right out of them molds it right into
[54:25] this into the great Symphony with of his
[54:28] word see and then they see the word
[54:30] moving on
[54:32] God knows when the rhythm of it has got
[54:35] to change
[54:37] he's talking about a great Symphony and
[54:39] God is the great composer and and all of
[54:41] a sudden it's beating out a certain
[54:43] Rhythm and then there's a time for a
[54:45] change it's beginning to change it's
[54:47] changing into a new segment of the of
[54:49] the symphony it's it's changing the beat
[54:51] he said and God knows uh God God knows
[54:55] when the rhythm of it has got to change
[54:58] and in in Abram's life he knew that the
[55:01] rhythm of it had to change
[55:03] there needed to be a greater separation
[55:05] how am I going to be bring a greater
[55:07] separation amen all of a sudden I know
[55:10] well I'll give them so much stuff that
[55:12] they can't dwell together amen and allow
[55:15] this little Spirit of strife to come
[55:16] into the herdsmen and all of a sudden
[55:18] there's great tension around Abram
[55:20] tension between the herdsmen of him and
[55:22] the herdsmen of lot amen this is not the
[55:25] situation that Abram was asking for
[55:28] it wasn't the situation that he wanted
[55:30] but it was God knows that there's time
[55:32] for a change of Rhythm the beat has to
[55:35] change we've got to get to the next part
[55:37] of symphony and I've got to change some
[55:39] things here and God allow some things to
[55:41] happen that'll bring the change
[55:44] it says he knows how the Rhythm goes I
[55:48] don't know how it goes but he knows he
[55:50] knows how it goes I don't but I look at
[55:53] it here and say well it's just coming
[55:55] many are the afflictions of the
[55:57] righteous but God delivereth them out of
[55:58] them all God has moved through history
[56:01] with the rhythm of the promise of his
[56:04] word in each age
[56:05] and the same Rhythm making it his word
[56:08] that's how God moved down through
[56:10] history from all the way from Genesis to
[56:12] Revelation he has moved through history
[56:14] with his word that's right with the
[56:17] rhythm of the power of the Holy Spirit
[56:19] vindicating his word to the elect
[56:22] God has known every change of every beat
[56:26] down through time from Genesis to
[56:28] Revelation amen he's allowed Wars amen
[56:31] he's allowed all kinds of famine and
[56:34] circumstances all to do what all to
[56:36] change the rhythm of the beat Amen to
[56:38] bring them into a new measure to bring
[56:40] him into a new part of the symphony Amen
[56:42] to take it amen higher to take it to a
[56:44] climax to do whatever he's going to do
[56:46] he knows it's time for a change of beef
[56:48] and it brings the circumstances about to
[56:51] bring the change
[56:53] and how many people were were upset
[56:56] about wars and how many people were
[56:57] upset about famines and how many people
[56:59] were upset about the circumstances in
[57:02] all these circumstances was God changing
[57:04] the rhythm of the beat for his great
[57:05] plan for his great Symphony
[57:08] but what God does on a grand scale he
[57:10] does in our lives do what God does Amen
[57:12] on a global scale he does for us and the
[57:15] microcosm of our life he knows when
[57:17] there needs to be a change amen and you
[57:19] say why did the plant shut down why did
[57:21] I lose my job amen why did all of this
[57:24] happen amen there's a changing of a beat
[57:27] he knows the Rhythm that you're moving
[57:29] to and he knows when it's time for a
[57:31] change let him bring the change
[57:36] Abraham was learning to surrender to the
[57:39] changes
[57:41] not to fight
[57:43] but to surrender
[57:51] brother bam said in the message
[57:52] expectation
[57:54] God told him to separate himself from
[57:56] all of his Kindred and God never did
[57:58] bless him anymore till he obeyed him
[58:00] fully
[58:01] as long as his father hung along while
[58:03] the old fella caused trouble and then he
[58:05] got with lot and then lot caused trouble
[58:07] and until he separated himself and got
[58:10] away from all the unbelief shook away
[58:12] from him then God came down and talked
[58:14] to him and something happened
[58:16] he then the prophet goes on to say in
[58:18] Abraham's Covenant confirmed now we find
[58:21] out that God told him to separate
[58:22] himself last night and away from his
[58:24] Kindred away from his people but Abraham
[58:27] like an ordinary man now God never run
[58:29] him out back to his homeland for doing
[58:31] it
[58:33] right think about that God told him to
[58:35] completely separate and he didn't
[58:37] completely separate first he went along
[58:38] with Dad God took Dad went along with
[58:41] lot and until God created the
[58:43] circumstance where lot would separate
[58:44] amen he was impartial Disobedience to
[58:47] the word but we know Abraham believed
[58:49] God and that's why he went and so now
[58:51] God it says because he was in that
[58:53] condition God didn't run him back to his
[58:55] homeland and give up on Abraham and send
[58:57] him back to where he came from he chose
[59:00] Abraham he's going to work with Abraham
[59:02] he's got a he's got a definite purpose
[59:04] in Abraham's life so what's he going to
[59:06] do he's going to start changing the
[59:07] rhythm of the music
[59:12] he never run him on back to his homeland
[59:14] for doing it but Abraham never did get
[59:16] blessed of God until he separated
[59:18] himself from all of his people
[59:20] he took his father along he took some
[59:22] more along took his nephew and the old
[59:23] fella always was in the way until
[59:25] finally God called him off the scene and
[59:27] then Lotus nephew backslid and went down
[59:30] into Sodom and then when he got
[59:31] separated from him then God began to
[59:33] tell him about the blessing what he was
[59:35] going to bless him I like that
[59:39] God was not hurting Abraham
[59:43] God wanted to separate him out because
[59:45] he had something else he wanted to tell
[59:47] him
[59:47] he had another part of the plan he
[59:49] wanted to show him there was going to
[59:50] come another confirmation of his promise
[59:52] and his relationship with Abraham was
[59:55] going to go deeper amen but he needed
[59:57] him separated to himself and what looked
[59:59] like harm was the one of the greatest
[1:00:01] things that ever happened to him
[1:00:05] and brother remember says and the same
[1:00:07] thing today
[1:00:08] he'll try to tell you these trials and
[1:00:10] things as your God trying to put
[1:00:12] punishment upon you It Isn't So no sir
[1:00:16] it's Satan doing that and God permitting
[1:00:18] it to temper you to make you see if
[1:00:21] you're tied to this earth
[1:00:23] by the care Earth cares or whether your
[1:00:25] treasure is in heaven for wherever your
[1:00:27] treasure is there you are also that's
[1:00:29] right your heart is where your Treasures
[1:00:32] are
[1:00:33] that's why
[1:00:34] Abraham was looking for a city
[1:00:38] he wasn't looking for a place to
[1:00:40] establish a city he was looking for the
[1:00:42] city of God he became Heavenly minded
[1:00:45] and the Earthly things didn't have a
[1:00:47] pull on him
[1:00:49] and now if we're in Christ then we look
[1:00:52] to things that are above not things that
[1:00:54] are on the Earth
[1:00:55] if we lose temporal things let them go
[1:00:58] if if things on the earth don't work out
[1:01:01] Let It Go
[1:01:03] there's many things that have been taken
[1:01:06] from us and I'm thankful for it amen
[1:01:08] there's many ideas that have been
[1:01:10] Stripped Away From Me Hobbies
[1:01:11] friendships uh jobs careers there's many
[1:01:15] things that I have surrendered or have
[1:01:17] been taken out of my hands amen and now
[1:01:19] I look back and say it was every bit the
[1:01:22] grace of God I couldn't stay in that
[1:01:24] relationship and grow the way he wanted
[1:01:26] me to grow I couldn't stay in that
[1:01:28] fellowship and grow the way you wanted
[1:01:29] me to grow I couldn't stay in that
[1:01:31] career and grow the way he wanted me to
[1:01:33] grow
[1:01:34] so God would change the circumstances he
[1:01:36] would change the rhythm of the beat in
[1:01:38] my life amen and then you can become
[1:01:40] bitter over what you lost
[1:01:42] I had so much going for me than this
[1:01:44] event transpired and now I've lost my
[1:01:47] savings I've lost my retirement I've
[1:01:49] lost my good career amen when it comes
[1:01:51] to God Amen you've lost nothing because
[1:01:54] your treasure is in heaven amen not on
[1:01:56] Earth there is no losing to a child of
[1:01:58] God what there is is surrendering and
[1:02:01] these fiery afflictions are there to
[1:02:03] burn the bonds off of us that are tying
[1:02:05] us down and keeping us EarthBound
[1:02:09] foreign
[1:02:10] if you lose you haven't lost
[1:02:13] if you're believing God and following
[1:02:15] after him with all your heart and he
[1:02:18] allows something to happen amen just
[1:02:20] take it as God's and God's Great purpose
[1:02:22] amen something else will work out
[1:02:25] it always does
[1:02:27] let's look at Mark chapter 10 keep your
[1:02:29] place in Genesis but let's look together
[1:02:31] in Mark chapter 10.
[1:02:37] Mark 10 and 28.
[1:02:47] foreign
[1:02:51] then Peter began to sand him low we have
[1:02:54] left all and have followed thee
[1:02:57] and Jesus answered and said verily I say
[1:02:59] unto you there is no man that had left
[1:03:01] house or Brethren or sisters or father
[1:03:04] or mother or wife or children or lands
[1:03:06] for my sake in the gospels but he shall
[1:03:09] receive a hundredfold now and this time
[1:03:11] houses and Brethren and sisters and
[1:03:13] mothers and children and lands with
[1:03:15] persecutions and in the world to come
[1:03:19] eternal life
[1:03:20] you can't lose following God
[1:03:25] you can't lose surrendering to him can
[1:03:28] temporal Earthly Things Fall Away they
[1:03:30] can sometimes God Amen when we're
[1:03:33] missing something when we're blind to
[1:03:35] something believing God following him
[1:03:37] but blind to something God has ways of
[1:03:39] making things go away
[1:03:42] God God can shut down your place of
[1:03:45] business
[1:03:46] and now you've got to go look for
[1:03:47] another job
[1:03:49] God can create situations that you know
[1:03:52] you have to separate from or God can
[1:03:54] bring to your light a situation and ask
[1:03:56] you to surrender it
[1:03:58] he can do all of these he can do like he
[1:04:01] did with Tara just take him away he can
[1:04:03] do like he did with lot create the
[1:04:05] circumstance where where you know you
[1:04:07] can't go on this way or he can do like
[1:04:09] he's done in other places with Abraham
[1:04:11] he can ask him to surrender and and
[1:04:13] watch Abraham of his own choice
[1:04:14] surrender
[1:04:16] God has done this for me on a couple of
[1:04:18] occasions where I've had to give up uh
[1:04:21] there was one a job that I I absolutely
[1:04:23] love the job that I enjoyed very very
[1:04:25] much but it kept me away from home it
[1:04:27] kept me far away the the company I
[1:04:29] worked for was based out of Columbus and
[1:04:31] I was spending nights away
[1:04:33] and I was doing some training work that
[1:04:35] I loved on industrial equipment and I
[1:04:37] was getting more involved with that
[1:04:39] working for corporate and I could really
[1:04:40] see a future and I really really loved
[1:04:42] it but I was also working with the youth
[1:04:44] at the same time
[1:04:46] and it was becoming hard to have youth
[1:04:48] meetings and it was becoming hard on my
[1:04:50] young family me being away and one day
[1:04:52] it was it was just it was just eating at
[1:04:55] me I was gone from home a lot and I had
[1:04:57] all these responsibilities and
[1:04:59] and I went into a hotel
[1:05:02] and this hotel was one I stayed in every
[1:05:04] time I was down there and I checked in
[1:05:07] and and I knew what section of Hotel I
[1:05:09] liked and I knew what backside topped
[1:05:11] you know
[1:05:12] and I told him and the woman typed it up
[1:05:15] she's been in my name she goes you've
[1:05:17] stayed here more this year than anybody
[1:05:18] else
[1:05:20] and I said oh boy
[1:05:23] this is not what I want in life
[1:05:26] and I I was already dealing with me on
[1:05:28] that and when that happened I realized
[1:05:31] I've got to give this up
[1:05:34] and I went in and I turned in my two
[1:05:35] week notice and I found a job and I took
[1:05:39] a ten thousand dollar a year cut and pay
[1:05:40] and we were a single income family
[1:05:43] raising several little children
[1:05:46] but I knew it was what God was asking me
[1:05:48] to do I knew it was what God wanted
[1:05:52] and there was some I can't explain it
[1:05:55] but there was some Freedom inside of me
[1:05:59] when I went opposite to laodicea
[1:06:03] when I knew what God was asking and when
[1:06:05] I made the decision to surrender to him
[1:06:07] there was something that energized my
[1:06:10] soul and I ended up so happy to make
[1:06:12] that choice because I knew it was the
[1:06:15] right choice for the right reasons it
[1:06:16] was for my family and it was so I could
[1:06:18] help with the youth and minister to them
[1:06:20] and I I ended up so blessed and I looked
[1:06:23] back and there are zero regrets
[1:06:25] whatsoever for giving that up
[1:06:28] none whatsoever I didn't lose anything
[1:06:31] because God was wanting to take me to a
[1:06:33] higher level amen the corporate world
[1:06:35] would have taken me One Direction but
[1:06:36] God was wanting to take me another
[1:06:38] Direction
[1:06:39] I didn't know it then but God wanted me
[1:06:41] to stand here now and God wanted me to
[1:06:43] pastor at church I had no idea of that
[1:06:45] then I just thought I was going to help
[1:06:47] out a little bit in the youth and my
[1:06:49] family needed me I thought the decision
[1:06:50] then was for the circumstances I was
[1:06:52] looking at then but I didn't realize the
[1:06:54] decision then was for circumstances that
[1:06:56] was coming down the road
[1:07:00] God knows the Rhythm God knows the sheet
[1:07:04] music for your life and he knows exactly
[1:07:06] what it's going to take and he knows the
[1:07:08] Junctions of time and he knows how to
[1:07:10] change the beat and he knows how to get
[1:07:12] a a little lady standing behind a desk
[1:07:15] to say the right word to trigger
[1:07:17] something in your heart
[1:07:18] God knows the Junctions amen and God I
[1:07:21] didn't have to do that I could have
[1:07:23] stayed where I was at and managed
[1:07:24] everything and made it work but I knew
[1:07:26] in my heart what God wanted and I
[1:07:28] surrendered and it was the greatest
[1:07:30] thing that ever happened to me and I'm
[1:07:32] standing here now because God moved me
[1:07:34] down that road
[1:07:35] he knows the Junctions he knows the
[1:07:37] change of time amen you could say where
[1:07:40] would you have been I could have maybe
[1:07:41] this and could have maybe that and you
[1:07:43] know so many years in the company and
[1:07:45] this and pay and benefits and blah blah
[1:07:47] blah and I say I don't care I didn't
[1:07:50] lose anything my treasures are in heaven
[1:07:53] amen they're secure rust does not defile
[1:07:56] moth does not eat nothing can touch
[1:07:58] where my treasures are
[1:08:01] these things in life are temporal we
[1:08:03] need to make sure we keep them temporal
[1:08:07] and God knows how to change the
[1:08:09] Junctions
[1:08:10] he knows how to beat out the Rhythm and
[1:08:12] he knows how to create circumstances
[1:08:14] where you know that you it's it it won't
[1:08:18] go anymore this doesn't work anymore
[1:08:19] I've got to change
[1:08:23] let's look at verse 14 now back in
[1:08:26] Genesis 13. Genesis 13. in verse 14.
[1:08:33] and the Lord said unto Abram after that
[1:08:35] lot was separated from him lift up now
[1:08:37] nine eyes and look from the place where
[1:08:40] thou art northward and Southward and
[1:08:42] Eastward and Westward
[1:08:44] for all the land which thou sees to thee
[1:08:46] will I give it into thy seed forever and
[1:08:49] I will make thy seed as the dust of the
[1:08:52] earth so that if a man can number the
[1:08:54] dust of the earth then shall thy seed
[1:08:56] also be numbered arise walk through the
[1:08:59] land and length of it in the breath of
[1:09:00] it for I will give it unto thee
[1:09:04] this is another confirmation in a deeper
[1:09:06] revelation of the Covenant God has made
[1:09:09] with Abraham and the promise
[1:09:11] but it said in the Lord said verse 14
[1:09:13] the Lord said unto Abram after that lot
[1:09:16] was separated from him
[1:09:18] God knew there needed to be a change a
[1:09:21] junction a change in the Rhythm and the
[1:09:23] beat and as soon as there was here he
[1:09:25] come with a greater portion of himself
[1:09:28] a greater revelation of his purpose in
[1:09:30] Abraham's life amen that God Amen had to
[1:09:35] take him through the junction and
[1:09:36] through the junction he came in contact
[1:09:38] with a greater measure of the promise
[1:09:41] there's so many Junctions in life don't
[1:09:44] be afraid of them
[1:09:45] just beyond them may be a greater a
[1:09:49] greater revelation of Christ in our life
[1:09:53] there was as I was standing through this
[1:09:55] there was a side thought that
[1:09:58] hit me with impact and I want to read it
[1:10:00] to you verse 14 or I'm sorry Chapter 14
[1:10:03] verse 14. let's jump to the next chapter
[1:10:05] and I want to just take a little
[1:10:07] diversion for just a minute and get
[1:10:08] right back but it'll all play in
[1:10:12] to the same thought
[1:10:15] and when Abram heard this is Chapter 14
[1:10:17] verse 14 when Abram heard that his
[1:10:19] brother was taken captive he armed his
[1:10:22] trained servants born in his own house
[1:10:24] 318 and pursued them into Dan
[1:10:27] we know that Sodom and Gomorrah in the
[1:10:29] city's roundabout were taken captive by
[1:10:31] an alliance of of kings and they and lot
[1:10:34] was in the mix and when Abraham heard it
[1:10:37] he grabbed his soldiers and went for it
[1:10:39] and he divided himself against them and
[1:10:41] and his servant by night and smote them
[1:10:43] and pursued them unto hoba which is on
[1:10:45] the left hand of Damascus and he brought
[1:10:48] back all the goods and also brought
[1:10:50] again his brother lot and his goods and
[1:10:52] his women also and the people
[1:10:56] and the king of Sodom went out to meet
[1:10:58] him after his return from the slaughter
[1:10:59] of cheddar LaMore and of the kings that
[1:11:03] were with him in the valley of Sheva
[1:11:04] which is the King's Deo in Melchizedek
[1:11:07] king of Salem brought forth Bread and
[1:11:09] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[1:11:11] high God and he blessed him and said
[1:11:13] Blessed Be Abram of the most high god
[1:11:15] possessor of Heaven and Earth and
[1:11:17] blessed be the most high God which had
[1:11:19] delivered thine enemies into thine hand
[1:11:21] and he gave him tithes of all
[1:11:25] I think this is so striking
[1:11:28] because God wanted Abraham separated
[1:11:31] from lot
[1:11:34] but God never intended for Abram to turn
[1:11:38] his back on lot to despise lot or disown
[1:11:42] lot
[1:11:44] I think this is absolutely amazing he
[1:11:46] had to separate from lot amen and God
[1:11:49] saw to it that there was a separation
[1:11:51] and after he separated he reconfirmed
[1:11:53] the promise and gave more details amen
[1:11:56] but but when when lot his brother got
[1:11:58] into trouble Abraham went to rescue him
[1:12:01] and when he went to rescue him when he
[1:12:03] came back who does he meet none other
[1:12:05] but Melchizedek Melchizedek doesn't show
[1:12:07] up in any other time he shows up at the
[1:12:10] time that he comes back from delivering
[1:12:12] his brother the one he has to be
[1:12:14] separated from but yet God honored what
[1:12:18] Abram did to deliver his brother lot and
[1:12:20] when he come back he served in communion
[1:12:24] I think this is absolutely so telling
[1:12:26] because there has to be separation from
[1:12:29] unbelief but that doesn't mean there's
[1:12:31] no more care or concern for people we
[1:12:33] have to separate from
[1:12:37] and and God even rewards Abraham by
[1:12:41] coming in his theophany
[1:12:43] as Melchizedek and feeding him bread and
[1:12:47] wine after the victory
[1:12:50] here's what the prophet of God says in
[1:12:51] Jehovah Jireh and notice what a type we
[1:12:54] find here after the battle is over after
[1:12:57] the real believer has fought the enemy
[1:12:59] broke down the lines and tried to
[1:13:01] capture his brother the the real Seed of
[1:13:04] Abraham bringing back that Wayward
[1:13:05] brother Melchizedek came out and served
[1:13:08] wine and bread communion giving
[1:13:10] communion after the battle was over
[1:13:11] served the communion to them after the
[1:13:14] battle what was he doing going after a
[1:13:16] wayward brother one that he has to be
[1:13:18] separate from because of unbelief
[1:13:22] but he's not supposed to quit loving him
[1:13:25] in the time of trouble he went to rescue
[1:13:27] him
[1:13:29] when God was coming down and he was
[1:13:32] going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:13:34] he allowed Abraham to know and he told
[1:13:36] him Abraham then began to intercede for
[1:13:39] lot he began to intercede for Sodom and
[1:13:41] said would the righteous judge of all
[1:13:43] the Earth would he destroy it if there's
[1:13:44] righteous in the Earth or righteous in
[1:13:46] the city if there's 50 if there's 45
[1:13:48] there's 40 if there's 30 all the way
[1:13:51] down to 10. here Abraham is interceding
[1:13:54] on behalf of Sodom because lot's down
[1:13:57] there
[1:13:58] and God is not ever it it never appears
[1:14:02] that God is ever upset at Abraham for
[1:14:05] loving lot
[1:14:07] I don't see in this I don't see where he
[1:14:08] ever rebuked him for loving life I don't
[1:14:10] think he ever rebuked him for rescuing a
[1:14:12] lot and he didn't rebuke him for
[1:14:13] interceding for Lots
[1:14:17] act it looks to me like he rewarded him
[1:14:20] on every account because when he come
[1:14:22] back from the rescue he met milk as a
[1:14:24] dick
[1:14:26] when when it go when we follow the story
[1:14:29] of lot down in Sodom and the angels come
[1:14:31] to him they it says they took them by
[1:14:34] the hand they took lot when lot delayed
[1:14:36] to leave they took law and his wife and
[1:14:38] his daughters by the hand and they
[1:14:40] rushed them out of the city and when God
[1:14:43] was going to destroy Sodom he remembered
[1:14:45] Abraham he remembered lot for Abraham's
[1:14:47] sake you remembered Abraham and rescued
[1:14:49] lot
[1:14:52] God even honored Abraham's love
[1:14:56] for lot
[1:14:58] do we have to separate from unbelief
[1:15:00] absolutely
[1:15:02] we have to separate from unbelief but it
[1:15:04] doesn't mean that God doesn't want us to
[1:15:06] love people
[1:15:08] pray for them rescue them when they're
[1:15:10] in need and intercede on their behalf I
[1:15:13] think God likes it
[1:15:16] from what I can see in Abraham's life
[1:15:18] you never see God chasing him or get
[1:15:21] angry with him but God remembers him in
[1:15:24] his prayer and rescues lot because he
[1:15:26] remembered Abraham
[1:15:28] never said he rescued a lot of his own
[1:15:30] Merit he rescued lot because he
[1:15:31] remembered Abraham
[1:15:33] and God has separated us
[1:15:35] many of us are separated from family
[1:15:37] members
[1:15:38] it may not be that we never speak to him
[1:15:40] but we're just not in Fellowship because
[1:15:42] there's the word has brought us
[1:15:43] separation
[1:15:45] the word has brought a separation
[1:15:47] sometimes and where we're used to
[1:15:49] fellowship and where we used to go to
[1:15:50] church in the denominational church we
[1:15:52] attended there's been a separation there
[1:15:54] needed to be a separation many times God
[1:15:56] calls for a separation
[1:15:58] but it never means that that separation
[1:16:01] takes away love
[1:16:04] could never be what Abraham was Lot was
[1:16:07] a penny Abraham was a silver dollar lot
[1:16:10] could never be what Abraham was amen but
[1:16:13] Abraham never rejected lot he just
[1:16:16] separated from him
[1:16:18] so I think it's still we have to be
[1:16:20] careful in our attitudes in these things
[1:16:25] and then let's keep reading let's go to
[1:16:27] verse 21 now Chapter 14 verse 21.
[1:16:33] and the king of Sodom said unto Abram
[1:16:35] give me the persons and take the goods
[1:16:38] to thyself and Abram said unto the king
[1:16:40] of Sodom I have lift up my hand unto the
[1:16:42] Lord the most high God the possessor of
[1:16:44] Heaven and Earth that I will not take
[1:16:46] from a thread even to a shoe latched and
[1:16:49] that I will not take anything that is
[1:16:51] thine lest thou should say I have made
[1:16:54] Abram rich
[1:16:55] so that when they come back with the
[1:16:58] spoils of the War the King of Sodom and
[1:17:01] says you can take it all just give me
[1:17:03] the people but he had already made a
[1:17:05] promise to God that he wouldn't take it
[1:17:07] because he didn't want any man to make
[1:17:09] him Rich he wanted God to get all the
[1:17:11] glory and the victory for it all
[1:17:13] he didn't want anybody the wrong idea he
[1:17:16] wasn't bound to temporal Earthly things
[1:17:18] he wasn't hungry for more all he wanted
[1:17:21] was what God gave him amen he didn't
[1:17:23] want anything else and when he turned
[1:17:25] that down amen because of what he made a
[1:17:28] promise that he made to God look at
[1:17:30] verse 1 of chapter 15. after these
[1:17:32] things the word of the Lord came unto
[1:17:34] Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram
[1:17:36] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:17:39] reward
[1:17:41] God when when Abraham would surrender
[1:17:44] God would come on the scene
[1:17:46] Abraham would surrender God would come
[1:17:48] on the scene
[1:17:50] he lived a life learning to surrender
[1:17:52] let's go to Genesis 17.
[1:17:56] I want to look at just a couple more
[1:17:57] places
[1:18:06] Genesis 17 and verse 15.
[1:18:11] and God said unto Abraham ask for Sarai
[1:18:13] thy wife
[1:18:15] Thou shalt not call her Sarai but Sarah
[1:18:17] shall her name be
[1:18:19] and I will bless her and give thee a son
[1:18:21] also of her yea I will bless her and she
[1:18:24] shall be a mother of Nations Kings of
[1:18:26] people shall be of her the neighborhood
[1:18:29] fell upon his face and laughed and said
[1:18:31] in his heart shall a child be born into
[1:18:33] him that is a hundred years old just
[1:18:35] Sarah that is 90 years old bear
[1:18:37] and Abraham said unto God oh that
[1:18:40] Ishmael might live before thee
[1:18:43] and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear
[1:18:46] thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
[1:18:48] his name Isaac and I will establish my
[1:18:51] Covenant with him for an Everlasting
[1:18:52] Covenant and with his seat after him
[1:18:57] he
[1:18:58] Abraham loved Ishmael
[1:19:02] is there any doubt in your mind that
[1:19:03] Abraham loved Ishmael his son
[1:19:06] and when God gave a promise of the son
[1:19:08] his promised seed coming through Sarah
[1:19:09] he he mentions Ishmael all that Ishmael
[1:19:13] could live before thee and he says no
[1:19:15] it's going to be the child from Sarah
[1:19:17] but I've heard you and I'll take care of
[1:19:19] Ishmael
[1:19:20] but he had a love in his heart for for
[1:19:23] his son let's go over to chapter 21 now
[1:19:27] we picked this up after the birth of
[1:19:29] Isaac
[1:19:33] and Isaac was when he was weaned Abraham
[1:19:36] had a feast and and at the feast Sarah
[1:19:39] saw the the Ishmael mocking in verse
[1:19:43] verse 9 of chapter 21 says and Sarah saw
[1:19:45] the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she
[1:19:48] had borne unto Abraham mocking wherefore
[1:19:51] she said unto Abraham cast out this Bond
[1:19:53] woman and her son for the son of this
[1:19:55] Bond woman shall not be Heir with my son
[1:19:58] even with Isaac and the thing was very
[1:20:01] Grievous in Abraham's sight because of
[1:20:03] his son and God said unto Abram let it
[1:20:07] not be Grievous in thy sight because of
[1:20:09] the lad and because of the Bond woman
[1:20:11] and all that Sarah has said unto thee
[1:20:13] hearkened into her voice for an Isaac
[1:20:15] shall thy seed be called and also of the
[1:20:19] son of the Bond woman will I make a
[1:20:21] nation
[1:20:22] because he is thy seed
[1:20:24] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:20:27] and took bread and a bottle of water and
[1:20:30] gave it into haggar putting it on her
[1:20:32] shoulder and the child and sent her away
[1:20:34] and she departed and wandered in the
[1:20:37] wilderness of Beersheba
[1:20:40] when I look at this I thought to myself
[1:20:41] when I read this
[1:20:43] I thought that I had been tested
[1:20:48] but I've never been tested like this
[1:20:52] he loved Ishmael we know the story
[1:20:55] re-read the story re-read the end of it
[1:20:56] and we go back later but Ishmael wasn't
[1:20:58] the one but but in Abraham's life he had
[1:21:01] had about four at this point about 14
[1:21:03] years with Ishmael he's about a 13 or 14
[1:21:06] year old boy and he loves him and they
[1:21:08] spent time together and he's raised him
[1:21:10] as his son amen and all of a sudden now
[1:21:12] God is calling for another separation
[1:21:15] amen because the seed is going to be in
[1:21:17] Isaac and now the bond one the Bond
[1:21:20] woman son must be put away and God
[1:21:23] speaks the the the through Sarah through
[1:21:26] strives through contention through
[1:21:28] through Abraham's wife now there's
[1:21:30] another situation again attention in the
[1:21:32] home and now she sees this that this
[1:21:35] Ishmael mocking her son she goes to
[1:21:37] Abraham and there's more trouble in the
[1:21:39] home
[1:21:41] and he says and he's grieved over this
[1:21:44] he says send away the Bond woman and her
[1:21:46] son for the Bond woman son shall not be
[1:21:48] Heir with my son and and Abraham's
[1:21:50] grieved and God comes to him and says
[1:21:52] don't be grieved
[1:21:54] listen to her
[1:21:56] listen to her and I'll make a nation out
[1:21:59] of him
[1:22:01] and the next morning he gets up and gets
[1:22:03] bread and gets water
[1:22:06] and he puts it on at our shoulder and he
[1:22:10] sends away his 14 year old son into the
[1:22:12] wilderness
[1:22:14] away from me
[1:22:18] I don't know that any of us have ever
[1:22:20] been tested to this level
[1:22:23] but by the time Abraham comes to this
[1:22:25] spot
[1:22:27] he's learned to surrender to God
[1:22:29] he has learned to give in What God Says
[1:22:33] is best and though he's he wants Ishmael
[1:22:36] to serve God he wants things to work out
[1:22:39] when God said send him away he sent him
[1:22:42] away
[1:22:44] and God had promised that he would watch
[1:22:46] over and make a nation out of him and
[1:22:47] God did exactly what he promised to
[1:22:49] Abraham
[1:22:50] even when they went and the water run
[1:22:52] out in the bottle and they were in the
[1:22:54] wilderness and they were going to die
[1:22:55] and Ishmael was going to die and haggar
[1:22:58] went over a bow shot from him because
[1:22:59] she couldn't watch him die God's
[1:23:02] promised to Abraham was still in effect
[1:23:04] amen because as the boy was laying there
[1:23:06] dying he whispered a prayer and the
[1:23:08] angel of the Lord came to haggar and and
[1:23:11] said I've heard I've heard the lad
[1:23:16] and he opened her eyes and she saw a
[1:23:18] well of water because God said he would
[1:23:20] take care of Ishmael and that had to be
[1:23:22] good enough for Abraham
[1:23:24] he couldn't figure it out he couldn't
[1:23:26] understand it he didn't know how it all
[1:23:28] worked out but the rhythm of the
[1:23:30] symphony was changing again Isaac was on
[1:23:33] the scene now and the promised son was
[1:23:35] Isaac Ishmael had to go but there's a
[1:23:37] changing of the Rhythm and Abraham
[1:23:39] didn't understand it but he knew by now
[1:23:42] that what God says is true God will take
[1:23:45] care of it all amen and he could take a
[1:23:47] loaf of bread and a bottle of water and
[1:23:50] put it on the the the Bond woman and the
[1:23:53] son that he loved so much and send them
[1:23:54] out knowing if God said he's going to
[1:23:56] take care of him God's going to take
[1:23:58] care of him
[1:23:59] and God proved his word once again you
[1:24:02] could try to reason and think it out
[1:24:04] figure out another way make another
[1:24:06] preparation he sent him off amen with
[1:24:09] bread and water and God took him from
[1:24:10] there and raised him up to be a great
[1:24:12] nation
[1:24:13] we can trust the word of God it doesn't
[1:24:16] it's not reasonable sometimes it doesn't
[1:24:18] make sense sometimes to our reasoning we
[1:24:21] don't know how it would work out but the
[1:24:23] point is not to figure out how it will
[1:24:24] work out before we surrender but to
[1:24:26] surrender and watch it work out
[1:24:32] hey brother Ben said in perfect strength
[1:24:35] by Perfect weakness
[1:24:37] said and make a complete surrender
[1:24:39] we cannot use one ability
[1:24:42] we've got to make a complete surrender
[1:24:43] and to come to God you've got to
[1:24:45] surrender to him both soul body and
[1:24:48] spirit everything that you are has to be
[1:24:51] surrendered to God in order that he can
[1:24:53] work his will in you and in me now
[1:24:56] that's hard I know because we're always
[1:24:58] wanting to put our part in something
[1:25:00] that we know you know that we want to do
[1:25:03] it we say well I just know it should be
[1:25:05] done this way but as long as you're
[1:25:07] doing it that way it's going to be wrong
[1:25:09] and God will never use that effort
[1:25:14] Abraham just surrendered to what God
[1:25:18] asked him to do
[1:25:20] and he sent away Ishmael and the Bond
[1:25:22] woman
[1:25:23] and God took care of it
[1:25:25] then God's going to bring him to another
[1:25:27] test
[1:25:28] which we all so familiar with let's turn
[1:25:30] to chapter 22 and read the test of
[1:25:33] Abraham with Isaac
[1:25:39] one thing I want to mention is
[1:25:42] when God started when God called Abram
[1:25:46] and led him away from his home
[1:25:49] God didn't start with this test
[1:25:55] God started him out by just leaving his
[1:25:58] Brethren leaving his Kindred and leaving
[1:25:59] his homeland
[1:26:01] and even in that he didn't do it
[1:26:04] completely right
[1:26:06] but God dealt with him along the way and
[1:26:09] God confirmed his Covenant with him in
[1:26:11] God every step Abraham took God blessed
[1:26:13] him he took another step God blessed him
[1:26:15] he took another step God blessed him and
[1:26:18] all the way God was working on his will
[1:26:19] and working on his word but when Abraham
[1:26:22] as Abraham grows and matures his level
[1:26:24] of surrender comes to a level of
[1:26:26] perfection where he learns to surrender
[1:26:28] to the will of God Amen If Abraham could
[1:26:31] go back to the land of UR to the
[1:26:34] chaldeas after he gained all this
[1:26:36] understanding the way he left would have
[1:26:38] been much different
[1:26:39] he wouldn't have taken father along he
[1:26:42] wouldn't have taken a lot along amen but
[1:26:43] he was he was just beginning his journey
[1:26:46] with the Lord he was just beginning this
[1:26:48] walk of Faith amen and he believed God
[1:26:50] but in his immaturity he didn't realize
[1:26:52] and understand what it means to really
[1:26:55] surrender to the will of God
[1:26:58] but God trains Abraham through all these
[1:27:01] circumstances and all these Junctions of
[1:27:03] life and you wonder what is my life all
[1:27:05] about your life is about the same thing
[1:27:07] Abraham's life was about the Junctions
[1:27:10] that you've had in your life the
[1:27:11] transitions that you've had if you've
[1:27:13] been on this life any number of decades
[1:27:15] then you've seen God change you move
[1:27:19] views change circumstances change the
[1:27:21] rhythm of the beat in your life
[1:27:24] if I could go back
[1:27:26] 20 years
[1:27:30] is anybody if any of you could go back
[1:27:32] when you first started serving the lord
[1:27:33] would you do things differently
[1:27:35] would you surrender more quickly would
[1:27:37] you obey better absolutely amen but God
[1:27:40] dealt with us where we were what God was
[1:27:42] looking for was Faith amen do you
[1:27:44] believe my word are you moving in a pure
[1:27:46] heart with pure motives in my word he'll
[1:27:48] take care of everything else he knows
[1:27:49] the Junctions he knows how to train us
[1:27:51] he knows how to get us where we want to
[1:27:53] be but listen friends there's more for
[1:27:55] us to gain there's a greater surrender
[1:27:57] that needs to come into the heart of his
[1:27:59] bride and he knows the Junctions he
[1:28:01] knows the changing of time and he knows
[1:28:03] what it's going to take to get a
[1:28:05] surrender out of you and I
[1:28:08] we look back and we see that was good
[1:28:11] for me and that was good for me and I
[1:28:13] learned so much there I learned so much
[1:28:15] here hey guess what you're still
[1:28:17] learning and what's going on today and
[1:28:18] what will happen tomorrow and what's
[1:28:19] going to happen next week is part of the
[1:28:22] same sheet music and the conductor knows
[1:28:24] the changing of the Rhythm
[1:28:28] I said this before I want to get to the
[1:28:30] place where I don't lose my mind every
[1:28:31] time something goes wrong
[1:28:34] God help me
[1:28:36] help me not help me not to slip into the
[1:28:39] carnal
[1:28:40] when it's just time for a changing
[1:28:43] in the music
[1:28:45] when God wants to bring a separation or
[1:28:48] a greater Revelation or or build another
[1:28:51] bit of character in my life I don't want
[1:28:53] to lose my mind and I don't want to act
[1:28:55] like everything's out of control nothing
[1:28:57] is ever out of control no matter how
[1:28:59] much out of control it feels to you
[1:29:03] nothing is nothing is going the wrong
[1:29:05] direction everything is going God's
[1:29:07] direction if you're a child of God His
[1:29:09] Eye Is on you and he's moving you in the
[1:29:11] right direction
[1:29:13] don't get hurt towards the circumstances
[1:29:16] don't get bitter don't say I mean don't
[1:29:18] even take the attitude well God God took
[1:29:22] away this
[1:29:25] like it's some negative thing
[1:29:29] we were all so happy together and God
[1:29:31] broke up our fellowship
[1:29:33] listen if anything ever happened to you
[1:29:36] it was for you
[1:29:39] everything that happened to Abraham was
[1:29:41] for Abraham
[1:29:45] and we have to realize
[1:29:47] that if I believe that I'm a
[1:29:49] predestinated seed of God I'm a Child of
[1:29:51] God everything that happens to me is for
[1:29:54] me
[1:29:55] and God is the great conductor and he's
[1:29:57] he's wrote the sheet music of my life
[1:30:00] and I may not exactly know what's coming
[1:30:02] I may think it's going one way but he's
[1:30:04] got another way for it to go all
[1:30:06] together when it comes time to to make
[1:30:08] the junction and I see it turn I want to
[1:30:11] say God I surrender to you
[1:30:14] have your way in me
[1:30:16] when he asked something as hard as send
[1:30:19] Ishmael away
[1:30:21] can you imagine your 14 year old boy
[1:30:25] sending him away
[1:30:27] but God had brought him from one
[1:30:29] Junction to another to another
[1:30:33] until he could do what God told him to
[1:30:36] do
[1:30:39] let's look here at Genesis 22 verse 1.
[1:30:46] and it came to pass after these things
[1:30:48] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[1:30:51] Abraham and he he said behold here I am
[1:30:54] and he said take now thy son thine only
[1:30:57] son Isaac whom thou lovest
[1:30:59] I love that the scripture put this put
[1:31:02] this in here
[1:31:03] whom now lovest
[1:31:06] and get thee unto the land of Moriah and
[1:31:08] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:31:11] upon one of the mountains which I will
[1:31:13] tell thee of
[1:31:14] I love how real the prophet makes the
[1:31:17] Bible
[1:31:18] I love for years growing up as a child I
[1:31:21] read the Bible and when I read the Bible
[1:31:22] I was very sterile towards the Bible
[1:31:25] these are things that happened long ago
[1:31:27] to people I don't know it was very
[1:31:28] sterile there was no feeling there was
[1:31:30] no emotion there was no entering into
[1:31:32] the story but the prophet of God as a
[1:31:34] way of dramatizing something till you
[1:31:36] can enter right in and begin to feel the
[1:31:38] feelings
[1:31:39] and I love that the Bible said take thy
[1:31:41] son thine only son whom thou lovest
[1:31:45] that Abraham loved this boy
[1:31:48] and what God was going to ask him to do
[1:31:50] was going to be in such a violation of
[1:31:53] that affection
[1:31:54] that the scripture says to take thy son
[1:31:57] whom thou loveest
[1:31:59] in verse 3 it says
[1:32:02] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:32:05] and saddled his ass and took two of his
[1:32:07] young men with him Isaac's son enclaved
[1:32:10] the wood for a burnt offering and Rose
[1:32:12] up and went into the place which God had
[1:32:14] told him
[1:32:16] what I absolutely love about this
[1:32:19] scripture
[1:32:20] is Abram Abraham does not ask God if
[1:32:24] there's another way
[1:32:26] he does not pray
[1:32:28] he does not reason he does not come up
[1:32:31] with a plan
[1:32:32] he wakes up early in the morning and he
[1:32:36] starts doing exactly what God told him
[1:32:39] to do
[1:32:43] this is why Abraham is the father of
[1:32:45] faith
[1:32:47] he had learned to believe God
[1:32:50] he had learned to obey God
[1:32:52] he learned to trust in the Lord and we
[1:32:56] are children of Abraham I want to learn
[1:32:58] to trust in the Lord to this level that
[1:33:01] no matter what he asked or what the word
[1:33:03] says I will willingly surrender to it
[1:33:05] knowing that it will work out perfectly
[1:33:07] fine
[1:33:09] this is where Abraham had got to Abraham
[1:33:11] did not believe that he was going to
[1:33:13] kill his son and his son was going to
[1:33:15] remain dead Abraham believed he was
[1:33:17] going to kill his son but he believed
[1:33:19] God would raise him up because he
[1:33:20] already had a promise and by now he had
[1:33:22] learned that God's word doesn't change
[1:33:26] he had already tried to bring it to pass
[1:33:28] by his own effort through the Bond woman
[1:33:30] and he had tried this and he had tried
[1:33:32] that but by the time he's come to this
[1:33:34] part in his life he has learned that the
[1:33:36] word of word of God works under every
[1:33:39] circumstance
[1:33:41] and he knows that God said and Isaac
[1:33:45] shall thy seed be called and he knew
[1:33:47] that that was the only way that it could
[1:33:49] be and if God wanted Isaac dead then God
[1:33:51] was going to have to raise him back
[1:33:53] because God had already said in Isaac
[1:33:55] shall thy seed be called
[1:33:57] this was Abraham in perfect faith and
[1:34:01] perfect surrender and a perfect
[1:34:03] obedience
[1:34:05] prophet of God says in Jehovah Jireh and
[1:34:08] then one day God wanted to make it real
[1:34:09] plain to the people in Phoenix
[1:34:11] so how was he going to do it he was
[1:34:13] going to give this Abraham a double test
[1:34:16] so he said Abraham take thine son thine
[1:34:19] only son and take him to a certain
[1:34:20] Mountain where I'm going to show you in
[1:34:22] their sacrifice him
[1:34:24] now what if Abraham would have took the
[1:34:26] second thought
[1:34:27] how am I going to be the father of
[1:34:29] Nations when the when where here I am
[1:34:31] this old and you're asking me to kill
[1:34:33] and destroy the only evidence that I
[1:34:35] have that you'll keep your word and make
[1:34:37] me a father of Nations
[1:34:39] and God loves to test his people every
[1:34:42] child that comes to God must be tested
[1:34:44] child trained no exceptions everyone
[1:34:48] and maybe tonight you're you're you're
[1:34:49] sick maybe tonight that you're sick just
[1:34:52] to have a little child training just a
[1:34:55] little testing don't be discouraged
[1:34:57] God's on the throne he knows all things
[1:34:59] if you're truly born of the spirit of
[1:35:01] God everything's working together for
[1:35:03] our good he's going to make everything
[1:35:05] right he promised he would he swore he
[1:35:08] would and he's got to keep that word
[1:35:10] he's kept it now for oh thousands of
[1:35:13] years to every believer would you be any
[1:35:16] exception no sir we're no exception now
[1:35:19] watch him now
[1:35:22] God keeps his word
[1:35:25] God keeps his children God knows what
[1:35:28] he's doing
[1:35:30] if God has asked you for a greater
[1:35:33] separation give him a greater separation
[1:35:36] if he has asked you for more sincerity
[1:35:39] give him more sincerity
[1:35:41] if he's asked you to give up a job give
[1:35:43] it up if he's asked you to give up uh
[1:35:46] something a hobby whatever if he's
[1:35:49] asking and moving your heart surrender
[1:35:51] to him
[1:35:53] there's Junctions in time
[1:35:55] there's things as we grow and as we move
[1:35:58] God's got to bring us into another phase
[1:36:00] another step another a work and he
[1:36:04] brings these Junctions of time in these
[1:36:06] transition times amen it's not time to
[1:36:09] reason it's not time to figure out it's
[1:36:11] time just to submit
[1:36:13] and say God if that's what you want
[1:36:16] that's what I'll do
[1:36:19] verse 5.
[1:36:22] and Abraham said unto his young men
[1:36:24] abide ye here with the ass and I and the
[1:36:27] lad will go Yonder and worship and come
[1:36:30] again to you
[1:36:32] you know what I I absolutely love this
[1:36:35] story we've been through it we all know
[1:36:36] it it's super familiar but every time I
[1:36:38] read it I get excited because Abraham
[1:36:41] didn't have to go through a bunch of
[1:36:43] emotion and a bunch of show he didn't
[1:36:45] he'd have to do anything to prove his
[1:36:47] faith he just did what God told him to
[1:36:49] do and he knew it was going to work out
[1:36:50] and he told he he told the two servants
[1:36:53] that are with him he didn't have to
[1:36:55] explain anything all he said is we're
[1:36:57] going to go Yonder in worship and the
[1:36:58] lad and I will come back
[1:37:01] how did he know because the promise that
[1:37:03] God gave you did he know what was going
[1:37:06] to happen no he didn't know it was going
[1:37:07] to happen did he have his own idea he
[1:37:08] probably had his own idea according to
[1:37:10] the scripture but it didn't happen
[1:37:12] according to his own idea but one thing
[1:37:14] he knew is that promise that he gave me
[1:37:16] is sure it is true
[1:37:20] you can say I know God's dropped it in
[1:37:23] my heart that by his stripes I am healed
[1:37:25] this sickness won't take me out amen and
[1:37:27] you don't know if he's going to use
[1:37:28] surgery if he's going to use medicine if
[1:37:30] he's going to do something Supernatural
[1:37:31] you don't know what's going to happen
[1:37:32] when you go to that mountain and you
[1:37:34] come back but you know that there's a
[1:37:36] Divine promise and if God is quickened
[1:37:38] into your heart that it's not this time
[1:37:39] then you can say I'm going to go through
[1:37:42] whatever I'm going to go through and I'm
[1:37:43] going to come back amen and I'm going to
[1:37:45] be healed in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:48] I don't know how I don't know why but
[1:37:50] God dropped it in my heart that this
[1:37:52] isn't my time to go I'm going to get
[1:37:54] through this
[1:37:55] what will happen I don't know I'm just
[1:37:57] going to walk
[1:37:59] I'm going to walk and I'm going to go as
[1:38:01] he leads and and if he's going to if
[1:38:03] he's going to take me a third through a
[1:38:05] surgery say God this is how you're going
[1:38:06] to do it if he's going to take you amen
[1:38:08] through medicine God this is how you're
[1:38:10] going to do it if none of it works you
[1:38:12] say oh God this is how you're going to
[1:38:13] do it you're going to show that none of
[1:38:14] it works because you're going to heal me
[1:38:15] steal
[1:38:18] not the time to get excited it's time
[1:38:20] just to press on and believe the word
[1:38:24] Hebrews 11 17 says by faith Abraham when
[1:38:28] he was tried offered up Isaac
[1:38:31] and he that received the promises
[1:38:33] offered up his only begotten son of whom
[1:38:36] it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed
[1:38:37] be called accounting that God was able
[1:38:40] to raise him up even from the dead from
[1:38:43] whence also he received him in a figure
[1:38:46] Abraham believed that God could even
[1:38:47] raise him from the dead
[1:38:49] Abraham had every intention of doing
[1:38:52] what God asked him to do he took the
[1:38:53] knife he took the fire he claimed the
[1:38:55] wood for the sacrifice he had every
[1:38:57] intention of fully obeying God's word
[1:38:59] but in his heart he knew that God could
[1:39:01] raise him up because he received him as
[1:39:03] one from the dead God could raise him
[1:39:05] easily from the dead he didn't know how
[1:39:07] it was going to happen but one thing he
[1:39:08] knew is he was going to do what God Said
[1:39:10] do but believe that when God made the
[1:39:13] promise that in Isaac thy seed shall be
[1:39:14] called that that word cannot change
[1:39:19] foreign
[1:39:20] if God said he's going to have a bride
[1:39:21] without Sparta Rico he's going to have a
[1:39:24] bride without spot or wrinkle and if he
[1:39:26] come through a prophetic if you come as
[1:39:27] a son of man through a son of man this
[1:39:30] time and told us that that you were
[1:39:32] Washed by the washing of the water of
[1:39:34] the word and what we have now is a pure
[1:39:36] word for washing then I can believe with
[1:39:39] all of my heart that this message is
[1:39:41] going to make me fit that scripture and
[1:39:43] I'm going to be perfect amen
[1:39:45] by what by a perfect word is going to
[1:39:47] build me perfect faith and God is going
[1:39:49] to have perfect obedience how are you
[1:39:51] going to do it brother Ted I don't know
[1:39:52] I failed a thousand times before I may
[1:39:55] fail another thousand times but I know
[1:39:57] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:39:59] that we've been given he will have a
[1:40:00] bride without spotter wrinkle and I know
[1:40:03] I am part of that bride
[1:40:06] how are you going to get there I don't
[1:40:07] know he's going to show me he's going to
[1:40:09] teach me I don't know what it's going to
[1:40:10] look like I don't know all the steps
[1:40:12] that we're going to go through but I
[1:40:13] know the destination I know what he's
[1:40:15] called for he's called for a Perfect
[1:40:17] Bride standing there in the Splendor of
[1:40:19] him
[1:40:21] and I know I will be that
[1:40:24] how he knows the Junctions and he's
[1:40:26] training me just like he trained Abraham
[1:40:30] amen
[1:40:31] this bride is coming to perfect faith
[1:40:35] and a perfect word
[1:40:37] you believe that
[1:40:40] she'll be standing there
[1:40:42] in his glory
[1:40:44] perfect faith and a perfect word
[1:40:48] and shall be in perfect submission
[1:40:51] say we're far from it I don't know how
[1:40:54] far we are
[1:40:55] but when Abraham started it looked like
[1:40:57] he was far from it but by the time he
[1:40:58] got to the end of his journey he was
[1:41:00] there
[1:41:03] God led him through Junction after
[1:41:05] Junction after Junction until he can say
[1:41:08] take thy son and only son whom thou
[1:41:11] lovest and take him to the mountain I
[1:41:13] show you and there slay him and what
[1:41:15] Abraham will do is wake up in the
[1:41:16] morning and cleave the wood and saddle
[1:41:19] the ass and get the fire and grab his
[1:41:21] knife and take his son and go to the
[1:41:24] mountain
[1:41:27] this is what God is doing to you and I
[1:41:31] this is where God is bringing us
[1:41:34] to where we'll have the faith of Abraham
[1:41:36] and if the word says do this we'll do it
[1:41:40] if the word calls for this we'll do it
[1:41:43] I don't know how it will work but it
[1:41:46] will work
[1:41:47] I don't know I it looks like it'll have
[1:41:50] bad consequences but I know beyond a
[1:41:52] shadow of a doubt that God will work it
[1:41:54] for good
[1:41:56] again in Jehovah Jireh says how are you
[1:41:58] going to do it Abraham explain to me
[1:42:00] if you've got the knife and the sheath
[1:42:02] here and the vision from God telling you
[1:42:04] to go kill that boy how are you going to
[1:42:06] how how are you two going to return back
[1:42:09] but God but Abraham believed God and he
[1:42:13] didn't take no second thought the only
[1:42:15] thing he knowed God gave the promise and
[1:42:17] if Abraham had received Isaac as one
[1:42:19] from the dead he knew that God would
[1:42:21] raise him up from the dead again and if
[1:42:24] you being dead and sin and trespasses
[1:42:25] without any nature to serve God at all
[1:42:27] and God by election called you and gave
[1:42:30] you his Spirit without you making any
[1:42:32] choice
[1:42:34] he says nobody can come to me unless the
[1:42:37] father first draws him that's not your
[1:42:39] choice that's his choice
[1:42:41] he chose to draw you before you were
[1:42:43] drawn and you would have never come if
[1:42:45] he didn't draw you it wasn't your choice
[1:42:46] it was his choice
[1:42:51] and if God
[1:42:54] by election called you and gave you a
[1:42:56] spirit without you making any choice no
[1:42:58] man can come to me except my father
[1:42:59] draws him first and if God did that
[1:43:01] through you without you being able to
[1:43:03] make a choice
[1:43:04] how much more will he heal you and keep
[1:43:07] you when you've got a choice by a sworn
[1:43:09] effort of his what a marvelous thing how
[1:43:11] that God promised Abraham didn't take
[1:43:13] the second thought he said well God's
[1:43:15] been good he kept his promise I don't
[1:43:17] know how he's going to do it but he will
[1:43:20] do it
[1:43:24] we are in training
[1:43:26] you're in training
[1:43:29] how many junctions have you had in your
[1:43:31] life
[1:43:32] how many terms how how many of you never
[1:43:36] imagined you would be where you are now
[1:43:40] never dreamed that you would be here but
[1:43:42] what was it Junctions
[1:43:45] changes in the rhythm of the beat
[1:43:47] and it moved and what what were you
[1:43:50] learning all through it all to surrender
[1:43:52] to the will of God
[1:43:54] to give in to him that he knows best he
[1:43:57] can read the sheet music and he knows
[1:43:59] exactly what's going to happen we didn't
[1:44:01] plan on being here we didn't plan on
[1:44:03] being like this but God knew what he was
[1:44:05] bringing us to and I don't know for you
[1:44:07] but I can say for me I'm thankful for
[1:44:10] every hard thing I've ever went through
[1:44:11] I'm thankful for every seemingly
[1:44:13] negative thing that happened in my life
[1:44:15] because it all has brought me to the
[1:44:17] place I'm at now
[1:44:19] I've I've had hard things happen in life
[1:44:22] I've had difficult situations we've had
[1:44:24] loss and we've had we've had rejection
[1:44:26] we've had all kinds of difficulties some
[1:44:28] of it were things that happened to me
[1:44:29] some of it were brought on by my own
[1:44:31] disobedience
[1:44:33] but now I stand thankful for everything
[1:44:35] that's ever happened amen every negative
[1:44:38] thing that brought negative consequences
[1:44:40] because it's moved me into a greater
[1:44:42] faith in God a greater understanding of
[1:44:44] his word and I believe more now than
[1:44:47] I've ever believed in my life and I see
[1:44:49] more now than I've ever seen in my life
[1:44:51] and I've got a heart that wants to give
[1:44:53] him more than I've ever wanted in my
[1:44:54] life
[1:44:56] and what brought us here training just
[1:44:59] like he did Abraham he's doing to
[1:45:00] Abraham's seed
[1:45:02] your life is training you're in training
[1:45:05] now you'll be in training tomorrow
[1:45:07] you'll be in training next week amen and
[1:45:10] let that training let the junction bring
[1:45:12] you to another level in the sheet music
[1:45:17] in perfect Faith the prophet says when
[1:45:19] Satan tempts us we are to resist him in
[1:45:22] a perfect faith and a perfect word
[1:45:25] like Jesus did the word of God is
[1:45:27] perfect we're to have perfect faith in
[1:45:30] his perfect word and resist Satan
[1:45:33] not by yelling at him not by a bunch of
[1:45:36] actions but by just believing God's word
[1:45:40] resist the lies of the devil
[1:45:43] how do you drive him out believe the
[1:45:45] word
[1:45:45] resist everything contrary to the word
[1:45:48] resist everything that would move you
[1:45:50] contrary to the word resist it
[1:45:52] and that's how you resist the devil
[1:45:55] let's go to Genesis let's read Genesis
[1:45:57] 22 9 now
[1:46:01] and they came to the place which God had
[1:46:03] told him of neighborhood build an altar
[1:46:06] there and laid the wood in order and
[1:46:07] bound Isaac his son and laid him on the
[1:46:09] altar upon the wood
[1:46:11] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:46:13] took the knife to slay his son
[1:46:15] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:46:17] him out of heaven and said Abraham
[1:46:19] Abraham and he said here am I and he
[1:46:22] said lay not thine hand upon the light
[1:46:24] neither do thou do thou anything unto
[1:46:27] him for now I know that thou fearest God
[1:46:30] seeing that thou has not withheld thy
[1:46:33] son thine only son from me
[1:46:37] God was testing Abraham and God wanted
[1:46:40] him to pass the test
[1:46:43] when he saw that he fully obeyed and
[1:46:46] withheld nothing God stopped him and we
[1:46:48] know he gave him a substitute and it's
[1:46:50] all symbolic but I want to go over to
[1:46:52] verse 15.
[1:46:54] it says then the angel of the Lord
[1:46:55] called him to Abraham Out of Heaven the
[1:46:57] second time and he said by myself have I
[1:47:00] sworn saith the Lord
[1:47:02] for because thou has done this thing and
[1:47:04] has not withheld thy son thine only son
[1:47:06] that in blessing I Will Bless thee and
[1:47:10] in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[1:47:12] as the stars of heaven and as the sand
[1:47:14] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[1:47:17] shall possess the gates of his enemies
[1:47:20] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[1:47:23] the earth be blessed because thou Hast
[1:47:25] obeyed my voice
[1:47:31] once again
[1:47:33] Abraham obeys
[1:47:35] God brings another Revelation and
[1:47:37] another confirmation
[1:47:39] after The Obedience after the surrender
[1:47:42] God comes on the scene and he says I
[1:47:45] have sworn by myself
[1:47:48] this is an unconditional Covenant that
[1:47:50] I've put my reputation on the line I've
[1:47:53] sworn by my own person that I will bless
[1:47:55] you in the and thy seed shall possess
[1:47:59] the gates of his enemy so for the Seed
[1:48:02] of Abraham God promised and swore by
[1:48:05] himself that there'll be a Perpetual
[1:48:07] victory over the enemy's Gates
[1:48:10] and guess what you and I are still
[1:48:13] benefactors of that promise because we
[1:48:16] are Seed of Abraham by being in Christ
[1:48:18] and we are now possessors of the gates
[1:48:21] of our enemies why because God swore it
[1:48:24] by himself because Abraham obeyed him
[1:48:27] because Abraham had perfect faith and
[1:48:30] because Abraham had perfect submission
[1:48:32] because Abraham believed God God made a
[1:48:35] promise and swore by him own self that
[1:48:37] the Seed of Abraham shall possess the
[1:48:39] gate to their enemy and here you and I
[1:48:41] are and we should thank Abraham over and
[1:48:44] over that he obeyed God because we're
[1:48:46] the benefactors of that obedience
[1:48:48] God has made a promise to us because he
[1:48:51] had some man in his hand that would
[1:48:54] surrender all to God almighty
[1:48:57] what is it we're learning
[1:48:59] to surrender everything
[1:49:01] what is it the bride needs a greater
[1:49:04] surrender
[1:49:05] in Jehovah Jireh the prophet says a
[1:49:07] woman it's her nature of a woman to
[1:49:10] surrender to a man and it's the nature
[1:49:12] of the church to surrender to Christ
[1:49:14] surrender to his will Just Surrender she
[1:49:17] has no thinking of her own she takes his
[1:49:19] word not somebody else's if Eve would
[1:49:22] have done that we'd have never had to
[1:49:23] die but she listened to reasonings but
[1:49:27] the real bride of Christ takes the
[1:49:28] headship of Christ the word and only
[1:49:30] believes God's word that's the real the
[1:49:33] restored bride
[1:49:35] it should be the nature of the true
[1:49:37] church just to surrender to him
[1:49:39] and not to question and not to become
[1:49:41] bitter and not to become angry and not
[1:49:44] to get upset amen at all the seemingly
[1:49:47] negative things but it's so much better
[1:49:49] just to say God knows
[1:49:52] the sheet music's already been written
[1:49:55] we've come to another Junction
[1:49:57] you know we we ask why president many
[1:50:00] people and the quote I read many people
[1:50:02] have asked me why and the message Shalom
[1:50:04] many people ask me why why did this have
[1:50:06] to happen he goes I've asked myself why
[1:50:08] why did this have to happen why was it
[1:50:10] like this why when I was a young
[1:50:12] Minister God took my wife right out from
[1:50:13] under me took my baby right from under
[1:50:15] my heart because I didn't know then but
[1:50:17] I know now
[1:50:20] you know
[1:50:22] he could have gotten bitter
[1:50:25] he could have been upset
[1:50:27] you could have been angry but he
[1:50:29] realized that it was all his Perfection
[1:50:31] God molding him for the work that he had
[1:50:35] to do
[1:50:37] you see Paul is not bitter Abraham's not
[1:50:41] bitter neither should the Bride of Jesus
[1:50:43] Christ be bitter over any situation that
[1:50:45] has ever happened in our lives
[1:50:48] if you're struggling with offenses
[1:50:52] bitterness
[1:50:53] and you may not even realize it but you
[1:50:56] may be hurt towards God for allowing a
[1:50:59] horrible situation or allowing a bad
[1:51:01] situation to continue
[1:51:04] I would encourage you to repent and say
[1:51:06] God I'm sorry
[1:51:08] I'm sorry but I realized just as true as
[1:51:12] you were to Abraham you're that true to
[1:51:14] me
[1:51:16] and just as much as you were in favor of
[1:51:18] Abraham through every Junction and every
[1:51:20] difficult situation that's what you're
[1:51:22] doing in my life for I'm one of your
[1:51:24] children and I'm sorry for being
[1:51:26] offended and I'm sorry for harboring
[1:51:28] bitterness and I'm sorry Lord for having
[1:51:30] a poor attitude and I'm sorry for
[1:51:32] blaming you
[1:51:34] nobody ever wants to do that but I tell
[1:51:36] you if you do that it'll set you free
[1:51:39] he's saying God I'm sorry I've been
[1:51:41] blaming you for my troubles I'm sorry
[1:51:44] I've been offended at you for allowing
[1:51:47] tragedy in my life and allowing
[1:51:49] travesties all around me
[1:51:52] but listen
[1:51:53] it's the junction of our life
[1:51:56] it's the molding of our character it's
[1:51:58] the shaping of Our Lives it is it is in
[1:52:01] the sheet music or else God wouldn't
[1:52:03] allow it
[1:52:05] what what he's going to do and what he
[1:52:07] intends and the purpose and what will
[1:52:09] happen next none of us know
[1:52:12] but I know one thing his promise is true
[1:52:16] he will have a bride without spot or
[1:52:19] wrinkle
[1:52:20] she will be in perfect Faith walking in
[1:52:23] Perfect Harmony to her word what's it
[1:52:25] going to take probably more of the same
[1:52:29] training teaching more word training
[1:52:31] teaching more word training teaching
[1:52:33] greater Revelation training teaching
[1:52:35] greater revelation
[1:52:37] is that what your life has been like
[1:52:38] that's what my life's been like don't
[1:52:40] expect it to stop get more training
[1:52:42] teaching greater Revelation training
[1:52:45] teaching greater revelation
[1:52:47] and understand that God's ways are
[1:52:50] perfect
[1:52:53] in the choosing of a bride like Adam was
[1:52:56] at the beginning man and his wife are
[1:52:57] one
[1:52:58] now she the true bride so sold out to
[1:53:01] him that she uses no mind of her own his
[1:53:04] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:53:07] is his word
[1:53:10] say God
[1:53:11] that's what I want
[1:53:14] I'm not
[1:53:15] what I ought to be
[1:53:18] I'm not even what I want to be but thank
[1:53:21] God I'm not what I used to be
[1:53:23] and if God can move us along in the
[1:53:26] Junctions of time and creating us a
[1:53:28] desire to surrender if he's done that in
[1:53:30] the past he's still able to do it
[1:53:33] and I thank God that he knows the sheet
[1:53:37] music
[1:53:38] and he knows the junction and it begins
[1:53:40] to be and and brother bear starts
[1:53:42] talking about that he's talking about
[1:53:43] the Symphony of Peter and the Wolf and
[1:53:45] he's talking about how you can feel the
[1:53:47] change coming there's an intensity to
[1:53:49] the beat there's something coming and
[1:53:50] you can feel the change coming then all
[1:53:52] of a sudden next thing you know it
[1:53:53] switches over and it's to another phase
[1:53:55] of the symphony
[1:53:56] many times in our lives you can feel
[1:53:58] that pressure mounting there's a
[1:54:00] situation that's that's that's closing
[1:54:02] in and you can feel the beat of the
[1:54:03] drums don't get nervous
[1:54:06] a junction
[1:54:08] just keep walking keep surrendering God
[1:54:11] will bring you to another phase of the
[1:54:14] song of your life
[1:54:15] God is good in all of his ways and he
[1:54:18] can be trusted
[1:54:19] what I want more than anything is I want
[1:54:22] at the end of my life I want I want to
[1:54:24] grow to that place where Abraham was
[1:54:27] where God says and I do
[1:54:32] where God says move and I move and God
[1:54:36] says go and I go and God says stop and I
[1:54:38] stop I want so bad to get to that place
[1:54:41] where God says and I do
[1:54:43] until I can look on the things that are
[1:54:46] above not the things on the earth that
[1:54:47] I'm willing to separate from every
[1:54:49] Earthly thing amen and lay my treasures
[1:54:52] in heaven where they cannot be lost and
[1:54:54] they cannot be corrupted and to where
[1:54:56] that becomes the central focus of my
[1:54:57] life that's where I want to grow to
[1:55:00] I've seen what God done and I see what
[1:55:02] this word is doing and I can see that's
[1:55:04] the destination
[1:55:06] say thank you God
[1:55:08] let me live like Abraham was able to
[1:55:11] live
[1:55:12] man let's all stand
[1:55:14] musicians if you come and
[1:55:16] Blake if you'll come
[1:55:21] I certainly don't want to go back
[1:55:24] to what I was
[1:55:25] a handful of years ago
[1:55:28] I don't want to go back to that kind of
[1:55:29] faith that kind of obedience I I want to
[1:55:33] and I and I tell you this I don't want
[1:55:35] to stay where I'm at
[1:55:37] I'm not satisfied or content with where
[1:55:39] I'm at
[1:55:41] but I want to keep growing the way
[1:55:43] Abraham growed and I want to keep moving
[1:55:45] and I know God's been so merciful to me
[1:55:48] God's been so kind to me when I was
[1:55:51] wrong he still took care of me
[1:55:53] when I had things that shouldn't have
[1:55:55] been there he still loved me and he
[1:55:56] still cared for me and he still brought
[1:55:58] me through and I know he's not going to
[1:55:59] abandon me now and I'm just going to
[1:56:01] stay with him and yield to him all that
[1:56:03] I know to do and he's going to keep
[1:56:04] bringing me through
[1:56:06] and I believe with all my heart the
[1:56:08] bride is coming to this perfect faith
[1:56:10] where she'll stand on the word if the
[1:56:13] whole world turns against her she'll
[1:56:15] stand on the word
[1:56:16] not knowing what will happen next it may
[1:56:19] look like everything we thought was
[1:56:20] going to happen goes completely opposite
[1:56:22] to what we thought but that's no time to
[1:56:25] change from the word
[1:56:26] God will still do what he promised to do
[1:56:28] for you and I
[1:56:30] am man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:56:33] Lord Jesus I thank you Father
[1:56:36] I thank you God that you gave a life
[1:56:38] like Abraham's
[1:56:40] God that you called him chose him you
[1:56:45] molded him and shaped him
[1:56:48] you brought him through the Junctions of
[1:56:49] his own Symphony
[1:56:51] we can read it oh Lord on the pages of
[1:56:53] the Bible that you by your grace have
[1:56:55] given to us
[1:56:56] and it stands as an example to us of
[1:56:59] what you're doing in our lives
[1:57:01] God our life is not a mystery anymore
[1:57:03] you've taken the seals off of your word
[1:57:06] you've peeled back the layers of this
[1:57:08] book so that we can see that our lives
[1:57:11] are not a mystery our lives are laying
[1:57:13] right here in the word
[1:57:14] what you've done for others you're doing
[1:57:16] for us
[1:57:18] Lord I pray that you'd give us a greater
[1:57:20] surrender in our hearts
[1:57:22] Lord forgive me
[1:57:24] forgive me Lord for my wrong thoughts
[1:57:27] and ideas and attitudes and actions
[1:57:30] and take me from where I am
[1:57:32] through every Junction that you have for
[1:57:34] me
[1:57:35] Lord let me believe in a greater way
[1:57:38] than I've ever believed
[1:57:40] settle in my heart like never before the
[1:57:42] Perfection of your will and word
[1:57:44] may I walk with my hand and yours
[1:57:47] trusting that all things work together
[1:57:50] for good
[1:57:51] Lord I want to be pleasing to you I want
[1:57:54] to have a faith that pleases you I want
[1:57:56] to walk and talk in a way that brings
[1:57:58] honor to your name I I want you to be
[1:58:01] pleased with me like you were with
[1:58:03] Abraham when he offered up Isaac
[1:58:05] oh whatever is holding me back take it
[1:58:07] out of my life
[1:58:09] whatever Lord is is hindering me take it
[1:58:12] away from me Lord I might serve you with
[1:58:15] a free heart
[1:58:17] with a free will to give all my life to
[1:58:20] you
[1:58:21] bless this congregation bless your
[1:58:23] people
[1:58:24] God and all that we say and do
[1:58:28] what's done for you is the only thing
[1:58:30] that matters
[1:58:31] help us Lord to stay in your perfect
[1:58:33] will
[1:58:34] trusting in you and loving you through
[1:58:37] every Junction
[1:58:38] just want to say I Trust You Lord
[1:58:41] I trust you God you're so good to us
[1:58:44] take us as we leave from here
[1:58:46] move in us and through us
[1:58:48] Lord shine the light through these
[1:58:50] vessels to this dark world and may some
[1:58:52] find their way to you
[1:58:55] oh that's our great desire May our life
