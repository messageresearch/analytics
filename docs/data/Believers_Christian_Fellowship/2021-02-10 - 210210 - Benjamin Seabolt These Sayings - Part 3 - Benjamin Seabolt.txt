to us in this age that we live in we're so grateful number one to have a cup that can be filled and then no he which can fill it if you would just take your bibles we'll go straight into the word this evening go to john chapter 10. beginning in verse 24. we'll just read this portion of scripture very familiar i just want to continue with this topic of these sayings that jesus declared john chapter 10 verse 24 says then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly jesus answered them i told you and ye believe not the works that i do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him let's just pray together precious lord jesus we just want to thank you once again for this opportunity that you've given to us lord to gather together with your children father lord to gather again lord around you the revealed truth for our age lord not around a man's idea or just a good thought or some philosophy lord but to gather around a person god himself and i pray that you would just come this evening lord that you would do that which no man can do and that you would take the book you would loose the seals and that you would just speak to us and accomplish that which your divine purpose has purpose before the foundation of the world for this service we just submit ourselves to you both speaker and here in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride says amen god bless you as you would have your seats i want to go ahead and read this quote again that we've based this topic off of very familiar but in 1965 the sea does not air with the shuck brother random said luther had justification wesley had sanctification the pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts but when the word came now they could produce that justification will save a man speaking of luther sure it was a carrier of the word just the same as i believe the stalk is part of the wheat sure it is but it's a carrier it ain't the life then along comes sanctification how many believes in sanctification you believe the bible you have to so still that's not it but then came the pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues there they called that the initial evidence which brought forth what the shock but they denominated but when you come to say i and my father are one and these other things then the shuck pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever so it's very obvious here this is what we're drawing our context from when he says that when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things implying similarity you begin to say that the shock pulls away from it and i just want to to look at this before we would move forward as brother branham is breaking this down he says the lutheran produced justification wesley produced sanctification the pentecost produced the restoration of the gifts but when you come to say i and my father are one and these other things the shock pulls away from it well he just identified the pentecostal revival at the restoration of the gifts as the shock that would pull away from that so by default if you're not preaching i and my father are one and these other things call yourself what you want you're shuck that's per the prophet that's not me that's per the prophet and he note if you'll notice at the beginning of this statement he says luther had justification wesley had sanctification pentecostals had the restoration of the gifts but when the word came so he's he's laying another dispensation in there he's laying another age in there he's laying another turning of the corner in there and he's saying that that when the word come remember if you if you'll look at the beginning of that paragraph and then at the end of it he's putting those two together when the word comes it will declare i and my father are one and these other things and anything short of that is shock and as i've said before we we don't want to discount the shuck because without no shuck there's no seed so we we don't want to point fingers as this is shock and this is shuck and i'm better than that because i'm not shocked and so forth if there's no shock there's no seed and as i said before brother branham himself said leave that shuck alone it was a good shock but what i don't want to do is get confused and identify and try to identify something as seed that's not seed when it's really shock and we don't have to use our definitions for that or even our mind for that because the prophet has given us a clear definition that anything that's not preaching i and my father are one and these other things the shock pulls away from that don't get hung up on when i say preaching these other things is then it has to be a man behind a pulpit preaching these other things remember our lives preach the gospel that's what we're concerned about so we can call ourselves bride all we want we can call ourself message all we want but if we are not living epistles preaching i and my father are one and these other things we're still in a shuck face and that's what we want to get away from i'm going to do a really quick review for maybe somebody that wasn't here for the other services uh again this will be really quick but i want to lay this basis back in here so that you so that everybody understands where we're coming from we learned that one of these other things was to be about the father's business and we learned that the definition of the father's business was to destroy denominational thinking by explaining the scriptures with their true spiritual meaning and to fulfill the scriptures that are written of yourself we learned that the bride has power to remit sin of unbelief by presenting the living word for the day the same as jesus and any other true believer through the ages did we learn that all hell is against the revelation of christ to the individual the spirit of truth says jesus christ is come in the flesh which is the true bride doctrine that this spiritual bride is the word made flesh flesh and blood again jesus christ misses jesus christ come in the flesh you can take that with a superficial understanding and say okay i believe that anything that says jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god but look at the implications because if the spirit of truth says jesus christ is coming the flesh what does the spirit of falseness say i don't know if that's a word but i'm going to say it anyhow what does the spirit of falseness say what does the spirit of untruth say it's not going to come and say no jesus christ is not come in the flesh what it's going to do is it's going to say jesus christ was come in the flesh or jesus christ is coming in the flesh because this the antichrist spirit in the last days would be so close to deceive the very elect it's not going to if it was possible but it's not going to deceive the very elect if it was possible with just an utter declaration that no that's impossible jesus christ is not come in the flesh but it will say jesus christ was come in the flesh it will say he is coming in the flesh and they may even say that with the superficial understanding of he yes he's in he is in the flesh but then they won't admit what flesh he's in that's the revelation that all hell is against because that's the revelation that the spirit of truth brings anything other than that is antichrist when the spirit of truth comes one of the statements that he will make is wilt thou be made whole as we went over the situation with the lame man laying there beside the pool for 37 38 years whichever it was he did not the spirit of truth does not come and ask you if you will be reformed the spirit of truth comes and asks you will thou be made whole he is not into reformation anymore saints he's definitely not into self-reformation but he will come in this age and he will say i and my father are one and these other things and he will pose that question to you will thou be made whole not just reformed we learned that the son does nothing but what the father shows him we learn that whosoever would hear the words of the son and believed on him that sent him hath passed from death and to life we learned one of those other things was you could make a declaration to search the scriptures for they are they that testified me i am come in my father's name the work of god is to believe on him whom he hath sent and probably the most important thing that we learned is that antichrist denominational spirit is within our own framework of our soul our spirit and our body that's probably the most important thing it's not in the church down the road it's not in the church across the country it's not in the church across the world the antichrist spirit within the framework of the christian church walks around on our own two feet each and every day and we have to be able to discern that that hybrid spirit that intellectual spirit that would give a superficial understanding of the word and not a true revelation of the word that would declare anything but i am jesus christ come in the flesh and we have to discern that and we have to withstand that most importantly and again i just want to say that as we would move forward through this this is not these are not uh necessarily anything new that we're going to be preaching our pastor has been preaching this uh he's been preaching it good he's been preaching it thoroughly we've uh definitely enjoyed that um so like i said this is kind of just me coming behind all of that and saying this is that this that we have been hearing is these other things and like i said i'm the slow farmer who takes a long time to do that and lays a really wide foundation and so on and so forth but that's just me but we can relax and and these things are not just new to us these have been preached and they've been preached in depth but we want to give proper placement to these and truly recognize what is what exactly is happening because when because brother branham says when you come to say these things the shucks going to pull away when you come to say these things the shucks going to pull away so if we've already been saying these these things even if we haven't realized we've been saying these things it still doesn't change the process that the shuck is going to pull away so it gives us a proper understanding of what's going on in our lives and again we have to keep our focus where it is appropriate and the shock pulling away is nowhere else but right here right here with us if we put it anywhere else we're going to miss it saints as we gave the example it gave no it gave no benefit to peter and john to know judas was shocked it gave no benefit to them because when the squeeze came and the pressure came they deserted just like everybody else did but what changed that was when they got a proper revelation of the shock within themselves and then were able to withstand that that's what made the difference so we want to focus on what's worth focusing on so with that being said we're going to pick up where we left off in john chapter 6 and verse 31 this is after they chased him across the sea they came to him and was asking him how he got over to the other side without them knowing he got to the other side and he just confronted them and said look you're here for the fishes and the loaves i know i get it so he discerned their spirit told them what they was after but then he continues uh we continue with that story here in verse 31. jesus spoke to them they replied back our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven now this wouldn't mean too much if this was all that he said but if you'll go back to verse 27 let's go back to 627 he says labor not for the meat which peri perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you so he just told them just previous the son of man is going to give you the meat that you need but now he says my father will give you that meat he will give you that bread there was probably somebody in the crowd that caught that and began to have a question what exactly is he trying to say and who is he trying to make himself because here he's saying my father is going to do it but yet here he's saying i'm going to do it a little bit of confusion there 33 says for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world so now he said my father's going to give this to you i'm going to give this to you but actually it's he that's come down from heaven see how you can take a shallow superficial understanding of something that's being said and just clearly miss it they were just telling him tell us if thou be the christ quit making us doubt tell us plainly and he's like i told you my father was going to give you the bread i told you i was going to give you the bread now i've told you that i'm here giving you the bread i've told you and you won't believe me what do you want me to do and then they get mad at him and want to stone him he just did what they asked him to do he told them plainly and they want to kill him the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life this is one of the other things that we have to declare not just him i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst it's easy to vocalize that but as our life declaring that is our life declaring i am the bread of life and if you're seeking life and if you're hungry for life you can come to me and you can be filled if you're thirsty you can come to me and you can have drink when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shuck will pull away try waking up tomorrow morning looking yourself in the mirror and saying i am the bread of life and see what your hybrid spirit does see how badly it recoils see how hard it starts laughing but remember the hybrid spirit is from the father of lies and he does nothing but tell lies he can't recognize the truth because he has no capacity to recognize the truth so just because two-thirds of you will laugh hysterically and recoil when you say that doesn't change the fact that you're a carrier of the bread of life therefore making you the bread of life therefore enabling you to give to somebody who's hungry and in need when you begin to say these things the shuck will pull away we're going to go back to or skip forward to john 7 because this ties right in with this john 7 37 in the last days the great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst so he's he's told them if you're hungry you can come to me if you're seeking the bread of life you can come from me but now you can come to me but now here he stands up on the last day of the feast and he says if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shuffle rivers of living water well you say that's fine if you're thirsty go to jesus go to jesus he'll give you drink he'll give you bread he'll give you everything that you need where are they going to go saints where are they going to go they have to come to a dispenser of water they have to come with a dis to a dispenser of bread they have to come to the spirit of truth there is no other spirit of truth there is no other heavenly manner there is no heavenly water outside of the message for this hour is jesus going to come down a 40-foot jesus on a cloud and start passing out message books is he going to give them tapes how is that going to transpire saints it's going to be a living life living bread living water a dispenser of eternal life walking around in hybrid flesh that is the manner that he has chose to come in we cannot bypass that manner as paradoxical as that may be it's not going to change and we have to become comfortable with that we cannot point people anywhere else there's nowhere to point them and if you're in a position in your life that you can't point them to yourself you need to change i need to change because we have to declare this we have to declare this in order to get the shock to pull away we have to declare this with our life verse 39 he says but this he spake of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galilee hath not the scripture said that christ cometh out of this of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was so they had a problem with historical facts that spirit's not dead they couldn't find his birth certificate so that's going to change who he is and what he's doing that spirit's not dead how foolish hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was yes it did say that and that's where he came from but they couldn't prove it they didn't know it you follow me saints that has no bearing on the fact just because they can't prove it just because they don't have the documentation that would satisfy satisfy them that does not change the fact that he fulfilled the scriptures and he he was who he said he was and he was doing what was prophesied of him to do so there was a division among the people because of him and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto him why have ye not brought him the officers answered never a man spake like this man then answered they the pharisees are ye also deceived are you caught in this cult too are you worshiping that man too next question have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him have we had a council on this yet does does the majority approve of this teaching is the mainstream christian ranks okay with this that spirit's not dead but when you come to say i and the father are one and these other things that spirit will pull away [Music] john 8 12 then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true this is so comical because here they are in chapter whatever chapter i was just in demanding him tell us plainly who you are and he says okay i'm the bread of life i'm the water i'm the light you bear record of yourself you're wrong he can't do anything to please them saints they demand him to do something and he does it and they want to kill him he's already told them they demand for them for him to tell them again plainly and he does and they want to kill him how do you win that how how do you win that i have no idea i have no idea but jesus never backed up on this they said tell us he said i'm the bread they said tell us he said i'm the water he said tell us i'm the light i and my father are one my father gives you the bread i give you the bread plainly as explicit as he can and they can't receive it and want to kill him jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know once i came and whether i go but ye cannot tell once i come and whether i go there's the answer to the problem they didn't know who their father was he did they didn't know where they come from he did i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me then said now remember this is not just jesus speaking these are things that we have to declare so don't get lost don't get lost in the reading anything you see there in your bible that's read that's one of these other things sorry i wasn't supposed to tell you that to the end i just gave myself away that's one of the other things that we have to say that we have to declare don't leave this 2000 years ago i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me can we declare that saints can we declare that then said they unto him where is thy father and jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am she i mean i am he ye shall die in your sins jesus never backed up one iota never took a half a step back never even stumbled never even stuttered i am the bread i am the water i am the light i am the way i am the truth i am from above you're from beneath unless you believe this you will die in your sins but yet he was still the humblest man that ever walked the face of the earth knowing all things had been given to him he girded himself and washed his disciples feet see this revelation is never one that will puff you up but this revelation is one that you will never back away from either you can declare these same saints and you can do it with the right spirit the right attitude and the right humility and it will be one hundred percent truth but you can declare these things with the wrong attitude with the wrong spirit and be one hundred percent wrong we have to say the right thing with the right spirit but just because it raises us enough raises an offense does not mean it's wrong and does not mean that we should not declare it jesus never backed up in fact i would say that he laid it on thicker he had a chance when he declared that i am the bread that come down from heaven and they've resisted that he had a chance to back up and just say okay well i won't say anything else but he didn't he didn't because out of that crowd there might have been one who needed to know you know what he said he was the bread that came down from heaven but yet he said that the father would provide that and then he said he's here doing it now see there was there may have been just one to catch it and it was to him it was worth the offense to the rest to be like jesus just to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him it's more than a song that was in chapter 8 jesus comes to chapter 9 and just in case that wasn't enough he says as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world when the bride goes up where's the mercy at gone brother branham says when she goes up there is no more mercy so long as i am in this world there is mercy on the place on the planet earth you say well that's pretty bold can you say it why can't you say it if your life is not in compromise to this revealed word you can say that and you don't even have to blush and it's true you say well i'm bearing record of myself to be like jesus just to be like jesus jesus publicly declared okay i am bearing record of myself but it's true search the scriptures they are they that testify of me he did not back up on the word because of the effects on the unbeliever we cannot back up on the word because of the effects it has on our hybrid spirit in our hybrid flesh we have to declare it and that will bring it under subjection so we're going to go back now to john 6 verse 36. jesus said but i say unto you he's speaking to that same group that he just told that he was the bread that came down from heaven he says but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me let me ask you this why did you come down from heaven to work a job to have some hobbies to buy a new house buy a new car to get a promotion to raise children why did you come down from heaven please don't tell me you've never been in heaven because i got something i'm getting to here in a second it'll be really bad if you say that why did you come down from heaven for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me this one verse with a proper revelation will cause sanctification and worldly entertainment and worldly living to never have to be preached again i have come down from heaven to do that which my father has sent me to do i have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him that sent me that's a really hard statement to apply to any kind of worldly entertainment or worldly living in fact i would almost say it's impossible see i don't need a whole list of things to go down you should not do this you should not do this shame on you if you're on this shame on you if you're involved in that i don't need that list anymore all that i need is this for you have come down from heaven to do your not your own will but the will of him that has sent you get a revelation of that your vices your habits your bad habits i would say will go by the wayside saints because it is the word that sanctifieth this is the word that has come to heal our diseases this is the word that has come to heal our vices this is the word that has come to draw us out of the world you say well i can't say that yet okay okay the first step to fixing the problem is recognizing there's a problem let him fix the problem pray that he would give you this revelation that i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but to do the will of him that has sent me there is so many things that that will alleviate with a proper revelation that i don't have time to make a list for it but when you catch the first part of that that i am come down from heaven that should do something for you to take worldly entertainment away brother brandon says christians are entertained by the holy ghost i can be entertained on that for a little while in fact i might get a little carried away when i start getting entertained on that i am come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me let's just make it as simple as simple to as can be when you roll out of bed tomorrow and your feet hit the floor and you go do whatever you're getting ready to do can you take the father with you is that the father's business it's that simple saints the scripture says everything that we do we have to do in the name of the lord jesus christ everything our hobbies our habits our behavior everything you say well i can't do that you can do that because that's the position the word puts us in and if the word puts us in that position it has to make a way for that to happen he has to bring the spirit of truth for the truth he has to bring a spirit to manifest the truth he has to bring the spirit to put that into action it is possible don't put it out of reach we have to declare these things because this is one of the other things we have to declare to make the shuck pull away and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day that's pretty bold you're going to raise him up at the last day then the jews murmured against him because he had said i am the bread which came down from heaven they still haven't got over that and he's already said like four other things that's just totally blowing them out of the water they're still mad that he said he was the bread then jews the then the jews murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven and they said the exact same thing that your hybrid spirit says to you is this not jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother i know how is it then that he saith he is the bride of jesus christ how is it that he saith he is the dispenser of eternal life is this not sister karen that i know i know her mother i know her father i know her and she's declaring that is this not sister elsie that i know is this not brother mike that i know bring it home saints is that not what he tells you every time you look in the mirror that's benjamin that i know i know his daddy i know his mommy don't try to say that to me you're bearing record of yourself because i know you i've got the birth certificate you're right i am bearing record of myself but my record is true because he that has sent me bears record of me and you're the father of lies you're the author of lies you can do nothing but lie because you're hybrid and that's what hybrids do is they tell lies in spite of everything we must declare that revelation even when the response from two-thirds of us is this is this not put your name in there the son of joseph whose father and mother we know is this not the same guy that blew up three days ago that i know is this not the same mommy who lost her temper four days ago that i know she's the dispenser of eternal life she's the water she's the bread she's the light she's the truth she's the way and if i don't believe that i'm going to die in my sins once the word is spoken it's true conduct does not change that once he has chosen nothing will change that jesus therefore answered and said unto them i'll stop talking now seeing that you all have a problem you all just relax go to church sunday wednesday pay your tithes pray every once in a while it's okay everybody just chill out jesus said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the father father with which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up in the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up in the last days it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me this is the part where i told you all that i've shared this with before you have to act like you never heard it before not that any man hath seen the father save he everybody say save he save he which is of god he hath seen the father it is written in the prophets they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh to me see saints it can't deceive the very elect because she's already been taught before you say well i don't remember that neither do i but if you can receive truth now it's because you've already received truth before what chance of that what chance are you going to be deceived if you've already received truth before you've already been taught of the father before you say well what form was that in i don't know but it was a form that i could be taught in and it was a form that i could receive that teaching and know it was true to the point that i would resist the devil's lie in heaven and kick him out every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh to me not that any man hath seen the father but that's what save means but he which is of god he hath seen the father you say well i don't remember that neither do i what form was that in i don't know but i could be taught in that form i could resist the devil's lie in that form and i saw my father in that form and that's why i can be taught now why i can see him now and that's why let's go to john 3 13 don't turn there you don't have time and no man hath to send it up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven how many times we've read that and we said oh yeah the son of man was in heaven and now he's on earth no read it again no man no man nobody hath ascended to heaven remember this is an eternal word if it applied then it applies now so do you intend to go to heaven somebody say yes for goodness sakes if you intend to go to heaven you better have already been to heaven because you're not going to heaven if you haven't already been there this is an eternal word word this was not just applying in jesus's day he's not just saying that people that have died up to this point none of them have gone to heaven except they came down from heaven this is an eternal word this applies now so if you intend to go to heaven that means you've already been to heaven and if you haven't already been to heaven you're not going because if you weren't in heaven you were not taught of the father and there's no way for you to get back to heaven unless you are taught of the father here if you were not already in heaven there is no way for the for you to have seen the father and for the father to have seen you and to recognize you as his child if you had not been to heaven you cannot ascend to heaven per jesus no man hath ascended up to heaven but he which came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven the son of man does not just apply to jesus's corporal body who is vocalizing these words we're familiar with that teaching i hope brother random says what does the son of man ministry do what's its purpose to produce the son of man again the son of man is the fullness of the word in flesh jesus said that the son of man let me back up for a second because i want to lay a trap for you are you the word made flesh if you were the word made flesh you are the son of man and if you were the son of man you have been to heaven and you have descended from heaven and while you were in heaven you were taught of the father you saw him and he recognized you and that's why here even now in a hybrid condition you can receive this message you can recognize him you can see him in the form that he has chose to come in the revealed word the reason that people have such a problem recognizing 1963 as the coming of the father is because they hadn't seen the father before period because if you would have seen the father and been taught of the father and he would have recognized you as his child you would recognize that he said i'm going to come in the form of the revealed word and that is me nothing different if you can't recognize him now in the form that he chose to come in it's because you didn't recognize him then because you weren't there i am from above year from beneath there's still those classes of people your hybrid spirit did not see the father that's why it tells you every day that he didn't come that's why he tells you every day he's definitely not in you because he didn't come there's no way for him to be in you your hybrid spirit was never taught of the father that's why it lies to you every day and tells you that you can't be taught of the father that you're going to be lost that you're going to be deceived your hybrid spirit came from the father of lies that's why it lies to you because the father of lies got kicked out of heaven he was not properly taught by the father because he couldn't receive that teaching he resisted it that's why your hybrid spirit reacts to the word the same way today it's because it's what it did back then it's going to do the same thing today so when your hybrid spirit resists the word now recognize it for what it is it's your hybrid spirit it's not you because you were taught of the father you did see the father you were in heaven and you have descended from heaven and you're going back to heaven amen jesus told them murmur not among you among yourselves i'll say to you murmur not to yourself he has declared this of you he has declared this of us saints he is the one obligated to fulfill it in our lives there is no way that we can do these things that he's tasked us with doing but he can do them let's believe what he said let's not murmur let's not murmur up here well the word says this but i don't see how that's possible that can't be me okay maybe my pastor maybe the maybe the musicians maybe the song labor not me not me nope murmur not amongst yourself do you intend to go to heaven you've already been to heaven it's that simple and if you were in heaven you were in todd of the father can you receive the word for your day if you can receive the word of word for your day that means you were already taught of the father saints you say you keep saying the same thing over and over and over i know sorry but somebody's got to believe that somebody's having a hard time believing that it's true saints it's true i cannot mechanicalize it for you i am sorry maybe one day we'll be able to i cannot mechanicalize it for you i cannot draw you a picture i cannot tell you the terminology that fits that i don't know what form it was i just know it was a form that i could be taught by the father i could kick the devil out of heaven and that i could see the father you say well what if that was just a thought we've already had that discussion god's thoughts are real if it was just a thought i'm okay with that i don't need to mechanicalize it anymore i'm okay with that 47 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life your fathers did eat men in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that man may eat thereof and not die i am the living bread which came down from heaven saints he is not backing up on this if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him he that eateth my flesh the word and drinketh my blood revelation on the word dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven what is what is the bread that came down from heaven he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him that is the bread that's came down from heaven that is the bread that has still come down from heaven that is the bread that is on earth that came down from heaven that is the bread that you are that came down from heaven that is your life that came down from heaven walking on earth today the revealed word being manifested revelation to the revealed word that is the bread which came down from heaven not as your father's diddy manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread what bread the revelation that i and my father are one shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue synagogue as he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it in the scripture nobody answered that question but i can answer that question this is a hard saying who can hear it those that were taught of the father those that hath seen the father those that were in heaven with the father and now have descended to do the will of the father those can receive it 61 then when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offends you doth this offends you i and my father are one and these other things does this offend you okay let's argue about it let's debate about it let's build fences about it let me build myself up about it let me put you down about it it's not what he did does this offend you okay well what if you see the son of man ascend up where he was before what will you say about that well that offends you too you say well that was jesus remember john 3 13 no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven amen don't debate about it don't argue about it just keep giving the word just keep giving the word if there's a seed there it'll spring to life just keep giving the word does this offend you what will you do when you see the son of man ascend up into heaven where i was before 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life the words that i speak you speak the words you speak the words that i speak they are spirit and they are life saints if we have a problem with that we've got a problem with the message because if that's not true that means there is another option besides this message and if there is another option besides this message we're lost and foolish people there is not another way jesus said i am the way. the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life does that offend you i and my father are one and these other things the words that i speak you say you are a hybrid individual you're right and if it was the hybrid individual speaking those words we would have a major problem but the hybrid individual cannot speak those words saints when i say speak i don't mean vocalize the hybrid individual cannot live cannot speak those words there has to be something within to live those to speak those words to be a written epistle and i have no shame declaring to you that the words that the seed within me put whatever terminology you want to on it i don't care the seed within me the soul that came from god the words that it speak are spirit and they are life and if you do not believe them you will die in your sins it's a paradox we have to accept the paradox and i'm not so concerned about saying that to where somebody else believes it i'm concerned of saying that to where i believe it i'm not concerned if you can convince your co-worker of that i'm concerned if you can convince yourself of that does that offend you hybrid spirit good i'm going to say it again and if that offends you what are you going to do when you see me ascend back up into heaven to where i came down from you're probably going to have a major problem with that because there's no more mercy for you anymore and you're the father of lies and the author of lies i'm not concerned about convincing somebody else you should not be concerned about convincing somebody else convince yourself have the proper revelation yourself if you have the proper revelation yourself and you come across the seed of god and you say i my father are one and these other things quickly that seed will spring to life i assure you it's impossible for it not to spring to life it's impossible you cannot take a genuine seed and put it in the ground and put the proper water on it and the proper light on it and not have a response it has to respond but don't try to convince somebody else that they and their father are one and these other things if you don't even believe it yourself don't try it it won't work the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life matthew 10 backs this up behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves biggie therefore wisest serpent and harmless as doves verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me acts 2 6. and it came to pass that as i made my journey paul speaking and was come nigh into damascus about noon suddenly they're shown from heaven a great light round about me and i fell under the ground and i heard a voice saying to me saul saul why persecutest thou me this is one of my favorite scriptures in the whole bible and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth who thou persecute us and we all know paul never saw jesus paul was persecuting the early church he was persecuting people that had been in heaven and came down from heaven and were doing the work of god they were doing the will of the father and paul was persecuting them and god himself came and said i am jesus who you are persecuting see we're not out in left field when we preach these things saints they're all through the bible all through the bible she is him if we can't get comfortable with that you might as well eat drink and be merry you might as well just burn your bibles burn the churches shut everything down and just be happy and live whatever your hybrid spirit tells you to live because that is the message saints that is what we are returning back to we are returning back to genesis 5. he created man male and female created he them and called their name adam that is the message that is the message and that is what the prophet has came and in 1200 different ways tried to tell us i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest matthew 25 40 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily remember we're talking about the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life and the king shall answer and say unto them verily verily i say unto you in so much as ye have done unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done to me he's the one that's put in this in this position saints not ourselves we're coming to a close just hang with me i know it's a wednesday night we're right about the hour mark we're going to wind this up really quickly but just stay with me through the rest of this second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation who hath given it he gave it we may not even ask for it he gave it because he had seen us before he had taught us before and we came to do his will he has to give us the ministry of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us that's a mouthful god's going to beseech you by me god's going to beseech me by you you're in a hybrid condition yeah saul saul why persecutest thou me so were the early christians in a hybrid condition god had zero problem identifying himself as them i did not say with them i said as them big difference if he would identify with them he did not he identified as them now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be ye reconciled to god these other things are not just something we're pulling out of a hat somewhere saints these other things are not just things that brother brandon made up because it sounded good in fact these other things got him kicked out of churches he had no reason to say these other things unless they were true because the response that he got was the same response that jesus got unpopular take up stones to stone him he's possessed to the devil he's false we know him he's the son of charles and alibranum he had no other reason to teach these other things saints it benefited him nothing unless they were true and that there was somebody that needed to hear him verse 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him that's a mouthful the righteousness of god brother branham says in the church age book if you accept jesus christ as your savior and you must you automatically accept that you are the righteousness of god to reject one is to reject the other it's not optional and if you accept him as your personal savior just in christianity 101 as simple as it comes you automatically accept yourself as the righteousness of god tell me that the righteousness of god does not have the power to remit sins on earth tell me the righteousness of god is not the bread that has come down from heaven tell me that it is not the water that this world needs tell me that it is not the light that this darkness needs it is and it is the only bread it is the only water it is the only life and the righteousness of god is what it has been from now back to whenever time started the revealed word for that age when you take the revealed word for that age and you put it in flesh hybrid or not that is the righteousness of god tell yourself that when you wake up in the morning doesn't matter what your hybrid spirit says just tell it hybrid spirit hybrid spirit why persecutest thou me and if you're real lucky it will ask you the same question who art thou i am jesus whom thou persecutest as the musicians come john 10 jesus answered them verse 34 is it not written in your law ye are gods see jesus did not back up on this word in fact he had a problem that they did not believe it this wasn't just something he was throwing out there okay well if you believe it okay if not okay jesus had a problem that they did not believe what he was saying he said is it not written in your own law that i said ye are gods is it not written in your law that i said you're god's it's almost like he was saying he was the one that wrote the law nobody asked him a question about that they were too mad that he would he already said that he was the bread that came down from heaven they couldn't get over that if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came has the word of god came to you don't leave this on the paper saints don't leave this 2000 years ago if it applied then it applies now and if we reject the implications of receiving the revealed word for our age we are rejecting christ we cannot receive the word in a superficial intellectual understanding and accept christ we have to receive him in the trueness of the fullness of the word and we have to bear the implications and believe the implications that it comes with regardless if two-thirds doesn't believe it two-thirds didn't believe it in heaven what makes you think your two-thirds are going to believe it now not going to happen it doesn't change the fact that it's true and jesus is not going to be happy if you don't believe that is it not written that i said you're a gods if he called them gods and to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him who the father hath sanctified and sent into the world has he sanctified you has he sent you into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god if he sanctified you and he sent you into the world if you say anything other than you are the son of god or the daughter of god you're blaspheming if i do not the works of my father believe me not but if i do though ye believe me not believe the works remember what the works were not your conduct the works was to believe on he which god sent believe the works have you believed on who god has sent don't say amen to that thinking about brother branham do you believe on he who god has sent that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i am in him right back to square one jesus cried and said he that believeth on me this is chapter 12 believeth not on me but on him that sent me jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me i am a light unto the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness when you begin to say i and the father are one and these other things the shock will pull away he that seeth me seeth god for god has sent me and i'm here to do his will you say well kind of no not kind of he that seeth me seeth him that sent me you remember the little story that brother branham told about the woman that confronted him on this and he said she says you're preaching the oneness of god wrong jesus was saying that when you see him you've seen god like when you when i've seen you i've seen your wife he says oh no oh no or she said that it's the same as you and your wife are one and he said oh no he said jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father when you've seen me you do not see my wife see we just thought that was a little carnal story he dropped in there we didn't realize it was actually one of these other things that jesus had said i and my father are one and when you have seen me you have seen the father that's bold saints but don't back up on it because it's true the father consists of the word the father is the word and if we have received the word because we've see we've received he that he has sent and we believed on what he has said to be true if we have received that we have received the father and therefore if we have received the father jesus said he that seeth me seeth him that sent me and i am a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness two more scriptures then we'll close if you'll play something quietly please john 13 verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whosoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me saints he is saying the same thing so many different ways that we can't miss it they then ask him to say it plainly and he did and they still missed it we now through a vindicated messenger can see these things and he is saying them over and over this is in chapter 8 chapter 10 chapter 12 chapter 13 chapter 18 he is saying the same thing over and over and over because he knows that one day it will come to the point that we as hybrid individuals with 66 percent against us will have to say and believe these things i and my father are one john 18 pilate therefore said unto them art thou a king jesus answered thou sayest i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice brother branham says what we need today is thousands of lived voices thundering out not passing out matches message books saying read this there's nothing wrong with that we should do that not sending an mp3 file and saying tell me what you think of this we should do that we should do more of that that's not what he was after though he says what we need is thousands of lived voices declaring i and my father are one and these other things that's what we need thundering out but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given of him of my father we went back to chapter six i'm sorry i'm just going to finish this up this is the end of chapter 6. therefore i said unto you that no man can come unto me accept it given it was given unto him of my father from that time from what time from the time that he declared i am the bread i am the water i am the life i have descended out of heaven to do the will of thought of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with the message of the hour i find it coincidental that that's in chapter 6 verse 66 not a good verse to be found in then jesus said unto the twelve will thou will ye also go away then simon peter answered to him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered them thank you peter thank you i'm so glad you'll stick with me i love you all jesus answered them have not chosen you 12 and want to use the devil don't expect the message to get easier saints if you are having a tough time swallowing i and my father are one and these other things don't expect it to get easier [Music] don't expect it to get easier because it's at that time it's at that time that he declares i've chosen you and one of you is the devil it's at that time the antichrist spirit really starts being revealed and declared not out there saints in here have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil maybe he could say to us have not i chosen you 33 percent and 66 percent of you is a devil yea yea lord but where would i go thou alone has the words of eternal life he spake of judas as carrick the son of simon for he was that that should betray him being one of the twelve praise the lord i got through chapter six let's stand every man therefore that hath heard have you heard and hath learned have you learned of the father cometh to me not any man hath seen the father save he which is of god are you of god he hath seen the father the form that the father has come in saints is the revealed word let it teach you see it be lifted up in the heavenly places where you were before don't back up on it declare the word of god regardless if 66 of you doesn't believe it or not not concerned about that 66 percent it is going to one of them 133 percent is going to go and be no more the other 33 percent is going to have its dna changed it'll take care of itself i'm concerned with the seed my soul my heart my true desires whatever you want to call it and i accept what he has said about me i accept the fact that i and my father the word are one i hope you can accept that i believe you accept that it should change our life saints a true revelation of that should change our lives and put us in a place that we can then declare i will do nothing i will do nothing outside of what my father showed with me i will do nothing i will crucify myself each and every day i will crucify my will each and every day to only do that which is of the father's business that's the point of it saints it's not to get lifted up it's to be humbled down that's the point of that revelation let's pray together precious lord jesus we thank you for this time that you've given us lord we would just pray that you would come lord and take the words that have been spoken lord we know that they are true because you have declared them and you have re-declared them through your vindicated messenger and we are here testifying that we are demonstrating the works of god by believing on him who you have sent and we accept that which he has told us and he has told us that we and our father are one and these other things lord i pray that you would just make them a reality in our life i pray that you would just be with us as we would go from here lord we're still in a carnal hybrid world and there's snow on the roads and it's slick and it's icy and it's cold but we have a scripture that says that the angels of god are encamped about him that fear him lord so we're not scared of that we would just relax in knowing that you're guiding us you have safely got us here you will safely deliver us home and we pray that as we would go about from this time forward that you would allow us to be about your business we ask these things thanking you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you saints let's sing brother ben as our pastor would come o father [Music] oh father we are one [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] we [Music] we are [Music] we are praise the lord you know i was thinking right as brother ben was talking and he even made the statement but i wrote it on my paper before he said that he said your body and your mind cannot believe that you've been in heaven because it hasn't been there there's only one part of you and that was the part that was an attribute of the father and that's the part that brother brent is talking about not what you see not the mind that you think with but there's some part of god that god has chosen to distribute in the earth in this time and that part is in you and that's part of god that's part of the word that's part of his mind that's the part that he wants to take and he wants to finish his work with and what he's asking for us is to believe him and to surrender and to try to stay out of his way so that he can do it it's not what we're going to be able to do we will never be able to do anything to begin with but we've got to believe that god is chosen it's god's choosing it's a part of god's life and i've just got to get this hybrid self out of the way and die and let god do what god wants to do [Music] man i'd like to i was reading today and christ is the mystery of god revealed and brother benham said the bride becomes the word by letting the word flow through her you become the word by just letting the word flow from surrender surrendering and letting him have his way amen and when brother man's preaching christ is the mystery of god revealed i just so realized and i realized during the preaching tonight that preeminence is the key without his absolute total preeminence it's impossible [Music] because there's the hybrid self can do nothing i want to read a couple scriptures while we're standing i don't want to hold you longer just to hold you longer but i just want to read something out of uh john chapter 5. go back to john john chapter 5 [Music] i believe it's john 5. john 10. yeah john chapter 5 and let's go to verse 17. but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god they realized that if he said god with his father and he was the son of god then he made himself equal to god let me go over here to john chapter 10 what what our brother ben had just read he says verse 29 my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one then the jews took up stones again to stone him jesus answered many good works have i shown you from my father for which of these works do you stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy because thou being a man maketh thyself god jesus didn't say he was god he said god was his father but they drew the equal sign now let's go to john chapter 20. this is after jesus resurrection and he shows himself to mary verse 16 john chapter 20 verse 16. jesus said unto her mary she turneth herself in saith unto him rabboni which is to say master jesus says unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend to my father and your father and to my god and your god [Music] when jesus had died and he resurrected he didn't just leave it his father only he said i go to my father and your father meaning you have the same father you are brethren he calls you his brethren you've come from the same life amen you've come from the lame same life source you're part of the same word you're part of the same thing amen and it in and the message has come to awaken us to who we really are we can no longer identify with the outer man we have to identify with the reality of what's going on inside this message didn't come to quicken our minds it came to quicken the seed of god on the inside and the mind may never be able to fully comprehend it but there's another part of you that come from god that says i don't know how i don't understand why amen it's not reasonable always but i say that's true i come from god and i go to god and now if i could just surrender myself to this word and let this word flow through me i become the word by letting the word flow through me it's not what i do amen it's not it's not just words that come in on my mouth but it's what he does through me that's what all he wanted in this hour he's just asking me to believe him ender surrendered him these things are so hard because we realize we're not talking about this man i can't get anything right i can't say anything right i can't even think right we're not talking about this man we're talking about a portion of god that he placed down inside and he's quickened by the word and he wants to through that attribute of himself he wants to display himself if you can just die to self and say god i believe the word let the word flow through me let that light let the light that's inside come out let the life that's inside come out let the word that's inside come out but the reality that's trapped inside of this tabernacle let it come out lord rent the veil of my flesh let me die and surrender and show yourself mighty in this life praise be to god how many feels incapable [Music] but how many believes by the grace of god this is the hour for the manifestation of the sons of god we're not capable but he is and he didn't ask us to do it he asked us to believe and confess his word and watch him do it i mean let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we surrender ourselves afresh to you god you told us that you are the vine and we are the branches and the branch can do nothing without the vine and lord without you we can do nothing but lord we believe it is you we believe it's you you've been quickened within our hearts and we believe that's you lord wanting to manifest yourself through these tabernacles i pray god that you give us a greater surrender than we've ever had before that we could surrender to your word in everything and that we would know that everything we've heard in this message is what you've showed us father and we only do that which you show us and you've showed us your word in the message of the hour now may we confess it may we live it maybe more than words but may it be a manifested life god we surrender to you and ask that you would take complete control for without you we can do nothing god i pray that you'd give us the right confession the right words the right approach to you lord for god we're trusting in you lord you've called us to this hour you've sent an anointing in your word your spirit is here to quicken this word to life oh god we're just trusting in you to do it i pray that you take control as we go from here may we go knowing that these things are a living reality they're true you have no hands but our hands you have no mouth but our mouth lord all that you were you poured into christ amen and all was in christ is now poured into his body which is the bride on earth in this day god do you have a deity tabernacled in flesh once again oh god help us to realize how important it is that we just obey that we surrender that we humble ourselves we can't humble ourselves enough lord but if we could just lord to humble ourselves and stay out of the way that you can do what you've always intended to do in this hour through these vessels while we give you preeminence we pray you take a greater preeminence for that's what's necessary to manifest this life oh we pray that you bless our brother ben that you would continue to inspire him and anoint him that he might preach the word and god that you would bless him and his family bless us as we go from here may we shine the light of the gospel in every dark crevice in this world and may others see and come to life lord or we just
