TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what was the whole purpose of of chastisement in a church setting and church discipline was for the saving of the Soul the whole purpose is for a real genuine love it's not love to let the sin remain amen and think somebody think that they're okay they're destroying themselves and destroying the people around them but true love says no we can't do this we must deliver you if you won't repent we must deliver you unto Satan amen for the destruction of your flesh that's all harsh amen but that's what God did to his children in order to save them and so sometimes chastisement seems so harsh and so hard amen but true chastisement is an act of true love amen churches today won't call out any sin not just Grievous and no sin no allow adultery and fornication and and and and and multiple marriages and all of these things just continue on and on and on and on and on and then and then constantly amen they're told God loves you God who blesses you God is your servant he he he wants to take care of you and do everything for you and make your life easy and make your life good and no correction no correction no correction and the people are being destroyed from within all kinds of devils are permitted to operate in their lives and take over them and bring destruction and keep the promises of God everything that's promised from the pulpit is not coming to pass because because there's no sin being purged out of the camp and the devil is allowed to sit right there and take advantage of the open door that's not love but it's called love they'll call themselves a Grace Church we're a Grace Church not a law Church Well a true Grace Church will have Grace enough to tell the truth because that's love love is not going to let you sit there in your sin and be destroyed but tell you this is not the word of God and if you can't line up to the word of God you can't stay here because you have to go amen and get your chastisement so that your soul can be saved because we're not going to let your soul die in a pew [Applause] what's called love is promoting death in pews you die in the church because they love you too much to correct you that's not love that's promoting death spiritual death going on in churches while praises and blessings are being showered upon the congregation so God help us never to get down to this path to where we just want membership and we just want people and we don't want hard things we don't want to deal with hard things and we don't want to say hard things amen because that's not love that's only a selfish love that doesn't want to go through the difficulty of tackling a difficult situation but love will sacrifice self for the benefit of its recipient and sometimes it doesn't look like love but it's love because that's how God loves and if I want to be like God I'm going to have to act like God many times we have to do things we don't want to do
