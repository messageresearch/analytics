angie and i will be leaving tomorrow morning for our trip for our 25th anniversary so we cover your prayers we'll certainly be praying for you all and while i'm gone we have the brothers who will be ministering this coming sunday june 5th will be brother jean kadima and i want to remind you once more that there'll be no communion service no second service this sunday then wednesday the eighth will be brother rich cobb and june the 12th next sunday will be brother nathaniel sias and then june 15th that wednesday will be brother marcus becker and lord willing and i should be home tuesday evening the day before so we should be here for that service so be remembering those brothers in prayer remember the service is coming up and i'm excited to hear what they'll be preaching amen we look forward to hearing the word man let's read together hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 and 9 and then we'll let you have your seeds hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 and 9. the though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and to all them that obey him amen you can be seated we'll ask the lord to bless us as we look into his word and the lord will open his word unto us in this scripture i just wanted to point out in verse 8 that he learned obedience so we have here that though he were a son yet he learned so there was something that he was learning and i want to highlight that because of this this quote that i want to go into out of who is this melchizedek from 1965 and i was uh i was either reading or listening to this and i and it sent me down a path i was thinking and the lord just began to deal with me in a certain way and it's a simple thought but it became very profound to me and uh and the message was this melchizedek starting in paragraph 67 he said now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany this body is subject to the word in earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and morphy body he came and lived in that in the person of melchizedek then later we never heard no more melchizedek because he became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ now you bypassed that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet so i started looking that in that form he knowed all things and jesus didn't bypass this theophany but he came with his theophany so jesus knew all things and i started looking at that and so i wanted to title this this evening all things and and then it goes on to say you come like adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but and look clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning remember goes from thought to word word made manifest word expressed you never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of god see you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in his thinking first but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and i'll raise him up at the last day see you had to be first amen so now he's telling us we had to bypass our theophany because in that form he knowed all things so we couldn't come knowing all things because we had to come to be tempted by sin amen we're on the same page so we had to come to be tempted by sin but jesus didn't bypasses the often he came with us theophany in that form he knowed all things but there was two other scriptures that i looked at and a quote that caused me to ask this question and i'm going to ask in a minute let's turn to matthew chapter 24 together matthew chapter 24. in matthew chapter 24 they asked jesus uh um three questions and he begins to answer them but when he gets to this one he says in verse 36 matthew 24 36 he says but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only and brother branham he refers to this scripture and christ is the mystery of god revealed and he says god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed anything about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and i listened that quote and i read that verse and i thought but he didn't bypass this theophany he came with his theophany and he knows all things but brother brahm said he didn't know this and the scripture says he learned obedience and i thought what does it mean to know all things maybe to know all things doesn't mean what i think it means maybe to know all things could mean something different than what i think to know all things means because brother branham said he didn't know this the son didn't know that's just the father and let's go to one more scripture in luke 2 luke chapter 2. luke chapter 2 and verse 41. luke chapter 2 verse 41 now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus teared behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee with sorrow i sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wished you not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom there's another one of those statements and he increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man so now we know from who is this melchizedek that jesus christ he did not bypass his theophany but he came with his theophany and we couldn't come that way because in that form we would know all things and so jesus christ comes but we know that that at 12 he went down to nazars with them and subjected himself to his earthly parents and and it says he increased in wisdom we know that he learned obedience and we know that that brother branham said that there was something that the son did not know only the father but we know that he knew all things did he believe that he knew all things i say he knew all things and if i could say it this way he knew everything that he needed to know amen he knew all the important things and he may not have known every single detail and all the facts and all the figures and all the information but he knew all things because when you look at him in the temple at 12 years old jesus now knows who his father is amen he knows who his father is we have no there's no scripture there's no indication of scripture that jesus ever received an angelic visitation of a messenger that would tell him who he is amen he just knew who he was amen he knew who his father was if he knew who his father was then he knew who he was he was the son of god and he knew he knew what his father's business was because he said i must be about my father's business so he knew who his father was he knew who he was he knew what the father's business was and he knew how to rightly divide the word because when he was talking with the doctors amen and the and all the theologians they were astonished at his understanding he was they were asking him questions he was listening to them and he was asking them questions and they were astonished at his understanding and we know for for sure that jesus was the word and jesus knew the word amen when he was 12 years old he knew the word amen but two taught it to him which messenger came to him who was jesus who was he taught by who was he listening to amen he knew all things he didn't bypass his theophany do you believe that so now when i look at that i realize when he knew who he was and he knew who his father was and he knew what his father's business was and he knew the word he knew all things amen and if you know that you don't need all the facts you know all things amen you don't need to know if it's going to rain tomorrow amen you don't need to know amen what's going to happen in your bank account tomorrow you don't need to know everything that's going to happen in your life all you need to know is the all things amen and if you know that everything is fine because the the one if you know who you are who your father is if you know what the father's business is and what your purpose in life is and you know that word for your day you know all things too amen and you don't need to know amen lord what will happen tomorrow in this situation what will happen tomorrow and this is which situation you don't need to know that you know all things because the all things that you know tell you that you're serving god's purpose and you have a father who's watching over you and the word has given you promises that you can apply and you know when i get to tomorrow tomorrow will be fine amen when i get to any situation every situation will be fine i don't need to know all the details i just need to know all things i just need to know where i came from who my father is who i am where i'm going and what what's the purpose for god in this day and if you know that you know enough to conquer every storm you know enough to overcome every trial you know enough amen to never be defeated by the devil what else do you want to know if you know who you are where you came from who your father is where you're going what your purpose is and what the correct interpretation of the word is what else do you need to know i would say you know all things amen amen let's look at this in the scripture let's look at john chapter 4. when i begin to meditate on this and think about the things brother branham said in the scriptures and the life of jesus christ amen and him not bypassing his theophany i begin to realize knowing all things isn't what i thought knowing all things was my definition interpretation of knowing all things was wrong and it had to be adjusted look at john chapter 4 now verse 19. the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that art a prophet we know in john chapter 4 here we're dealing with the woman at the well the samaritan woman where jesus had deeds to go by samaria so jesus took a a route that was intended he had need to go this route amen because he had an interaction that needed to take place with the woman at the well and he begins to discern her life and the woman said i perceived that that were the prophet then she says verse 20 our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worship worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and the woman said unto him i know that messiahs cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things what did jesus just tell her he began to tell her the proper place of worship he began to tell her the day and hour that she was living in and he began to discern her and she began she says when messiahs come which is christ he will tell us all things amen and the question is did jesus tell them all things absolutely but it may not be all things like we thought all things was he told them everything they needed to know to identify their day and to identify themselves amen they could identify the day that they were living in and if they could identify the day that they were living in and identify him and identify the faith that they'd received they could identify themselves and then they would know all things so she says the messiah cometh he is called christ and he has come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he i am the one that will tell you all things brother branham tells us now that just like this woman at the well she bypassed her theophany and she was living a terrible life she had had five husbands the one that she was living with then was not her husband she would have been an immoral woman had a bad reputation a bad identity a bad reputation in the city who knows how she viewed herself or felt about herself amen but jesus had needs to go by because he had to tell this woman something because she had the wrong understanding of who she was and she had the wrong understanding of life and she had the wrong understanding of worship and then jesus was going to come by and begin to reveal all things and begin to tell her all things that she could break out of the life that she was in and break into the life amen to the person that she truly was her identity amen was masked was hidden was a mystery because of all the facts and all the information and all the details of her life but she was not she was missing the main details of her life she was missing the main information in her life had been withheld from her because she bypassed her theophany she came to the earth with spiritual amnesia amen and it was going to take this encounter with a living word that was going to begin to begin to break that amnesia so that she could identify what the all things really were she was going to get all the information she needed brother ben begins to say in the identification of christ in all ages it says look at that little woman see she had fallen from god's thoughts have you fallen from god's thoughts bypass the theophany she was a thought that was now in flesh she was a thought of god that was now in flesh but what she knew there was now darkness to her here what she knew because she bypassed her theophany she came straight she from the thoughts of gone she was now in flash and then when she was in flash although she was part of the thoughts of god she was that part was darkened to her in her human flesh and her human experience amen but god was going to come and brighten that area bring bring a revelation to her awaken the seed that was on the inside of her so that she would know the things that she needed to know so look at the little woman she had fallen from god's thoughts she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven so because she was fallen from god's thoughts and she was now living in flesh she still had representation in heaven something was representing her in heaven she was a thought that was now in flash but she had representation in heaven now the thought and flash was shrouded in darkness and she didn't know who she was and where she came from and who her father was and what the purpose of her life was on earth she didn't know that but she had representation in heaven and now the word was coming to her the word was coming to her in her day and it says she turned around look at the difference between her and them preachers her priests and preachers when they saw it they said well this man is a fortune teller they didn't know the word now you can take and contrast this woman at the well with those with those pharisees and with those with her priest and you would say which one knew the word she would if you if you went by testing and by intellect and by education you would say this woman didn't know the word and all these priests would know the word but brother branham said they didn't know the word because when they encountered the word they didn't recognize it they didn't know it they did not have representation in heaven she had representation in heaven they were not a thought that fell from the thoughts of god she had fallen from the thoughts of god so that means she was part of that word she knew the word amen they didn't know the word she may never have passed the test she may never been able to write the essay they may have had all the intellectual understanding but they didn't know the word she knew the word because she came from the word she was part of the word her origin was the thoughts of god and now she's sitting here waiting to come in contact with the word so that the word can begin to tell her all things all things she needs to be a daughter of god all things she needs to break out of that life all things she needs to live the message for her day and i'll tell you what else did she need to know what else did she need to know he says she says i know that when messiahs come to jesus christ he'll tell us all things and he says i am he that speaks to ye so what was she receiving the person who was telling her all things and maybe just maybe all things are not every detail maybe to know all things doesn't mean that you're going to know what's going to happen tomorrow and next week and the week after and you'll be able to predict and you'll be able to this and that maybe that's not what you need to know maybe there's something else that we need to know he says he goes on to say they didn't know the word look what she said we know sir you must be a prophet we haven't had one for for hundreds of years and we know when messiah come that's what he's going to do oh my brother the bible says in the fourth seal he said here comes satan with all four corners of the earth with his protestants and his catholics and all together marching right up to the battle of armageddon so i just i just want to throw a side note in there so when when satan comes to the battle of armageddon he doesn't come with tanks and he doesn't come with armies he comes with protestants and catholics so what do you think this battle of armageddon is going to be like you gather not armies but you gather protestants and catholics there's a spiritual armageddon that's going on and he says all right and here comes jesus coming down from heaven with resurrected saints vindicated word so they were vindicated word and said if god speaks and sends you he backs up what you say see and if you're an ambassador from heaven all heaven's behind you and heaven is consisted of the word so what is heaven consisted of the word so if you have the word you have heaven if you have the full revelation of the full word what is separating you from heaven amen you have heaven heaven has been opened up in this day that's why there was a door open in heaven because there was a revelation of the word that was opening up because heaven consists of the word and the word's been opened up amen so there was a great revelation amen that links us to heaven because we know in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so you don't separate god in the word so if you have the word what else do you need if you have the revelation of the word for your day what else do you need that's the question that's what i want us to walk away tonight walking out the door saying by the grace of god amen by by having representation in heaven and by having a seed down on the inside i have been able to receive amen the prophetic ministry of malachi 4 which told me that we have the correct interpretation with divine vindication we have the word we've been given all things in our age and i wanted us to walk out this door saying i have all things amen i'm not hunting i'm not looking for i have received all things and i need the all things to i need the all things to direct my whole life i need the all things that i received to give me all my information for living [Music] amen why because what do we receive all things amen this woman she could receive the message of the messiah because of two things because she had fallen from the thoughts of god and because she had representation in heaven those pharisees and sadducees they didn't have representation in heaven and brother branham said they didn't have anything to believe with because you don't believe with your brain they had a brain you don't believe with your emotional realm with your mind amen because they had all of that she had something they didn't have they had nothing to believe with she had something to believe with what did she have they didn't she had a seed gene of almighty god on the inside and she could believe with that they had nothing to believe with that's why she could receive the all things so we had to come not knowing all things so why did we come not knowing all things because we had to be tempted by sin what is sin unbelief so we had to be tempted by unbelief and we had to come not knowing all things because if we'd known all things we wouldn't have been tempted with unbelief so we had to come with that part darkened to us in our understanding and our intellectual human understanding amen so that we could be tempted by sin so that so there could be an awakening and a receiving of all things and overcoming for the day that we live in and if we ever overcome in this day and receive the messiah for our day it'll be because there's two things working in our life one because we fell from the thoughts of god and two we have representation in heaven and if you fell from the thoughts of god and you have representation in heaven and by that god is able to give you a revelation of the word for your day what else do you want what are we looking for what are we waiting for what what else do we need to overcome we have everything we need to overcome every situation that will come our way [Music] brother bam said in the message spiritual amnesia said you that wants the holy spirit you that wants the experience not an emotional excitement you want the holy ghost the life the germ of life inside you and you want to get rid of that amnesia that makes you you can't identify yourself you don't know where you stand you don't know what you are let's get rid of it right now there is a new birth here for you a real genuine new birth what will the new birth do quicken the seed inside of you amen and bring to life amen the believing ability that's inside of you to believe the word of god and to act on the word of god and receive all things amen i want to read it i want to read just a couple more things before i make this comment and the message who is this melchizedek it says then after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany that statement is so exciting to me because if i can hear from my theophany it means i have a theophany and i have a if i have a theophany then i have representation in heaven and if i have representation in heaven then i have fallen from the thoughts of god and if i've fallen from the thoughts of god then i'm part of the thoughts of god that means i'm part of the word that means i can't be lost that means i can't miss it that means i can't be left behind amen that's because i'm predestinated i'm part of god amen i'm part of that word amen in all heavens consists of the word amen what are the believers the words in the book amen what's in heaven the word who's the word the believers amen then you heard from your theophany listen i i get more excited about this day by day amen because without this there's no hope for us amen without this we would never have received the message he says when you recognize the very word of god was eagle food and you left the other thing you turn from everything else and you begin to eat the eagle food you recognize there's nothing there nothing there nothing there nothing there i i i heard the very word of god and i knew it was eagle food and i turned from everything else and began to feed on this then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of god you heard from your theophany if this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting praise be to god and listen if i heard from my theophany when i received this message then i had to have a theophany before i received the message and i'll tell you i had representation in heaven [Music] in the message god's provided way of healing he says this is from 1954 but i want you to catch this quote i've quoted it once here before it says now we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word so we can preach it we can explain it but you have to receive the word and that's what sets that's what sets it a fire brother when you receive it the revelation something slips out of the unseen world yonder and comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it amen something slips out of the unseen world world yonder comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul and says now i see it what brought a revelation there's a mystical channel and something from the ncaa world come rolling down that mystical channel dropped into the soul to bring a revelation said now i seen it so how did you see it when you saw that this was eagle food you heard from your theophany so your theophany's on the other end of the mystical channel on this end of the mystical channel is the sea gene of god the thought of god that fell from the something that fallen from the thoughts of god's here on the other end of that mystical channel is the theophany and these two together are feeding all things into your soul let's look at matthew 18 10. this next thought just thrills me matthew 18 verse 10. matthew 18 verse 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven what little ones are he talking about he's not talking about little children he's talking about the little ones of the kingdom that believe any little one that believeth on me he's talking about the believers amen so the believers he says don't offend one of these little ones the believers for their angel always beholds the face of my father which is in heaven brother brennan's asked the questions in 1964 from questions and answers said explain about each person's angel who abides with them from birth unto death brother bram says very good question and he goes down and he says explain he reads it again explain about each person's angel who abides with them from birth now if you'll notice now this is pretty deep now i i never i just picked it up part of its wrote and type and the other one's in pencil or pen now there is an angel but this angel to the lord that are encamped about those that fear them that fears him now it isn't promised that sinners has angels so we're talking about a different kind of angel amen they're not the sinners doesn't have angels it's only the redeemed has angels did you know that the angels of the lord and camp about those that fear him now angels are messengers i want you to notice it's so perfect and it'll prove predestination to you the fact that only the redeemed have angels proves predestination to you and these little ones of the kingdom are their angel always beholds the father's face so there's a receiver inside of the believer a sieging of god amen in the soul to receive revelation amen and when you received the revelation that this was eagle's food and left the others you heard from your theophany so there's a representation of you somewhere that can see the father's face which means with that representation there is nothing hidden amen there's nothing obscure there's nothing hidden that representation can see the father's face and if the father's faith is unveiled to that angel amen praise be to god brother branham said now he says and angels are messengers what message are they carrying and to who amen because the angels are messengers amen are you receiving any messages amen is there any revelation coming on this revealed word in the end time praise be to god amen we have representation in heaven [Music] and i'm so glad there's a mystical channel somewhere that something can come rolling down from the unseen world and landing here just like the woman at the well amen she didn't she didn't have to go to school she didn't have to do any experimentation amen she's standing there talking to the man began to receive something was moving inside of her at this visitation and she began to receive the word and brother branham said because she had representation in heaven [Music] and i just say thanks be to god that there's ears somewhere that can hear amen there's eyes somewhere that can see amen i need more than these ears and i need more than these eyes i need something a little deeper because many people have heard many people have seen and still not believed but oh god thank god for eyes and ears that can hear and see amen brother branham goes on to say in things that are to be i'm just going to touch on this and then keep moving he says now in things that things that are to be now remember these are only temporal gifts in time now we know that moses in building the tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven so the earthly things only express what the eternal things are and of this earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if that if this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's eternal when you see a tree struggling pooling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital or a sick bed or an accident struggling and the death rattles in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that see it just doesn't do it now they are temporal gifts to us these things only expressing that there is one where it's where it's the eternal one that's what jesus has gone away to prepare the eternal one for us now they only express there's a there's a greater of some kind because these are the same kind now remember the bible said if this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling if it perished be dissolved we have one already waiting do you have a body waiting do you ever thought theophany have you heard from your theophany do you have representation in heaven that representation in heaven is not blind that representation listen this body has senses is that right this body has senses it can see amen it can taste it can hear amen but the theophany has senses too amen and the theophany can see and the theophany can hear i'm so glad that there's a theophany that can see in here there and has some way to communicate with me down here to communicate to me down here what it can see up there because we're limited down here but if we have representation in heaven that can see amen that can see the father's face that can see openly that can hear the truth that can see the reality amen and and it has some way for me to hear from my theophany then i say praise be to god amen i can hear from something that's there something that can see and something that can hear amen i'm not reliant just upon the the this dimension and i'm not relying just upon these physical attributes that i have in a physical body or in a an earthly spirit realm there's some other part of me amen that can access something somewhere i don't understand it and i don't understand how it works but i've been the recipient of it friends i've been the recipient of that great channel how does it work i don't know how to describe it i don't know maybe i'm describing it all wrong now i don't know but all i know amen is that i've heard from my theophany i know for sure amen that there must be representation in heaven and something in the soul that can connect and can bring us to revelation of all things because what revelation does it bring it brings the revelation of who you really are who your father really is it brings you the revelation of the word is that right and it and it gives you your purpose in this life the revelation of the word does all those things and i'd like to say like i said before what else do we need when i start thinking about this subject and start thinking about i had to bypass the theophany to come to be tempted in a realm of unbelief and then to take our stand upon the word and but god he knew how to bring revelation to each one of us and he and he brought a word amen a perfect word in this day and he unveiled the mystery amen that was in the back part of his mind from before the foundation of the world at the opening of the seals he opened the word and brother branham said my bible became a new book to me amen and the seals have been taken off the word of god amen the heavenly realm has been opened up and there's been a call to come up higher amen to see these things and i say what else do we want and what else do we want to focus on and what else do we want to look at and what else do we need to overcome and i begin to realize i begin to i begin to meditate on these things and and i began to say i don't need to know what's happening in all of the world i don't need all the information i don't need to know i don't need to know every bomb that's dropped in ukraine and what city it's hit and how many peop i don't need to know that everything i know has been given to me in the message everything i know is this word of god that's been unveiled i don't need to seek other information i don't need to seek after other things amen the thing i need to pursue after with all of my heart is this message that's been given to us this word that's been unveiled because every obstacle i'll find is explained by the word everything that's going on in the world is explained by the word amen the devil is constantly trying to bring distractions to give us information but that information is not all things the facts and the details and the information is not all things and cannot add to all things all of that is cannon fodder the all things is the word the word is all things the word is everything the word is my life so i don't need i don't need the news to figure out my life in fact i don't need so many things that i felt that i needed in life i don't need and so many things i thought i needed to know to be successful in life i don't need to know so many things i wanted i've wanted to learn you know one of my problems is i love to research i love it i love to read i love the research i love to look things up but none of that is helping me with my purpose in this life none of that is moving me in the program of god none of that is what i need amen what i need is this word this word is all things to me this word is all things jesus could know all things and he could learn he could know all things and increase in wisdom he could know all things and say only the father knows when the son of man will come but he still knew all things and we could somebody could ask you a question about you know what's going to happen in this situation what do you think will happen with with this set of circumstances in the world and you can say i don't know but you can still know all things because you know the real things and if you know the real things you know all things amen you know i i i talked a couple weeks ago about you know the the the the way the lord's been dealing with me on my phone and the time on my phone and i realized there's facts there's information there's details there there's story lines and then there's there's everybody's opinion attached to it there's a story about what's going on in the economy everybody's got an opinion there's a story about what's going on with war everybody's got an opinion there's a story with all this and all these opinions and i say it's all every bit cannon fodder amen it all passed away it's all the wisdom of man it's all nonsense and it is not what i need amen none of it has come down that mystical channel and hit me amen it's all come through a digital channel and the digital channel is bringing lies but the mystical channel brings the truth and i want to be tapped into the mystical channel amen i want to receive information not from all these sources there's one source i want to receive and i want to receive the one that can bring revelation on the word because that's all things to me if we overcome will overcome by the word if we have victory it'll be victory by the word if god amen if god ever delivers us it'll be by the word if we ever get over anything it'll be by the word and brother brethren he comes down to the end of his ministry and he begins to talk and he begins to say the stabilizers have been put on the ship what i didn't see the stabilizers what did they look like what shape and what ship he's speaking spiritually the stabilizers have been put on the ship what what came through his ministry it was the word and when the word was revealed the stabilizers came on the ship and said she'll crest every wave you see a wave coming don't worry stabilizers are on the ship you see trouble brewing don't worry stabilizers are put on the ship the problem is when we hit uncertain times in times of uncertainty especially if we've never gone down this road before what we try to do is get as much information about it as we can amen and we've already been given all the information that we need if i believe if we would spend as much time searching the message as we spend searching other sources then god would give us the answers to all of our problems if we spent as much time searching the scriptures and searching the message as we do searching for answers out on the net and asking friends and finding experts amen that's fine amen everything is fine amen but there's one expert i need and that's expert king jesus amen who's brought the word in this day and that's the expert advice that i'm looking for i this is just me but i want to get more advice on my knees than i do in somebody's office [Music] i think god is has got to hone us down amen and get us focused again there's too much information amen and we think the world's gone into chaos and it probably is going to continue to get more chaotic and can get you to get it all kinds of worse amen and nothing listen i i i am so far removed from wanting to hear one conspiracy theory there's you know i'm patient with a lot of things but i am not patient with that everybody's listening to somebody who they know knows that has the answer uh they're listening to somebody some 40 year old man in his mother's basement who can't even hold down a job and he's going to explain to you how the world works and what's going on i mean you don't know these people you don't know their credentials and you don't know what they know and they don't know but i know in whom i have believed and i know that the word that he's given us is pure and i know it's unadulterated and i know it's perfect and i know that it'll never fail and i know that this ship has the stabilizers and it'll crest every storm what else do i need to know but this amen i say god help me my desire more than ever is to be centrally focused on the word and the greatest portion of my spiritual diet coming from this word and my time from the word and fellowship around the world and enough with the world i'm done with the world i'm preparing to leave the world i don't want to spend any more time with the world i don't need the world's information i don't need the world's answers all my answers have been given to me in this revealed word everything we need everything we need for our families everything we need for our finances everything we need has been revealed to us in this word amen i think we'd be amazed at what we find laying in this message and in this bible amen to answer our questions if we would just spend time there what do i do about this family situation how about consulting the word i don't know where to look well just keep reading where do i turn what message do i listen to i don't know i can't tell you just read them all and eventually you'll hit the answer amen that little woman at the well she had to come in contact with the word for something to unlock inside of her and it was the revealed word that unlocked her identity and broke her spiritual amnesia and she began to realize that i'm not the son of charles and elle branham i'm not the harlot i'm not the prostitute i'm not the immoral woman of samaria i'm a daughter of god can you imagine the joy in that woman when she realized i'm not the immoral prostitute of samaria i'm a daughter of almighty god amen no wonder she dropped her old water pot went running back into the city let's look at together at second peter chapter one i want to look at just a couple more scriptures when i look at what has been given to us and the potential that lays in this word i begin to get excited and when i see the world getting into a greater chaos i get more excited because the potential is in the word that's been given to us let's look at ii peter chapter 1 verse 2. ii peter chapter 1 verse 2 grace and peace be multiplied into you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue so look at that again his divine power verse 3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things all things that pertain unto life and godliness this life is a zoe life so we've been given all things all things that pertain to eternal life and godliness what has been given to us all things all things that pertain to life and godliness what else do we want these are the old things he's given what else are we looking for i think we found what we've been looking for i think we've found the source of all things i think we've received all things and i think we need to let all things become everything amen let's look at first john chapter 2. just go over just a little bit first john chapter 2. and let's read verse 18. little children it is the last time and as you have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us because they were not of us for they had for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us but you have an unction from the holy one that word unction means anointing you have an unction you have an anointing from the holy one and you know all things when when jesus comes to the samaritan woman and said messiah will tell us all things the messiah didn't tell them everything they couldn't answer every question about every silly question somebody would ask them they would have to say i don't know but i thought you said the messiah will tell you all things but he didn't tell me that but here you have an unction of the holy ghost you have an unction let me read that again but you have an unction anointing from the holy one and you know all things the question is the people that john were writing to did they know everything about everything did they know every detail about everything in life no but he says you have an unction of the holy one and you know all things what are the old things he's talking about he's talking about the all things that i want and the only things that i want are the all things that john's talking about under this anointing of the holy one we have all things amen brother branham goes on to say in the god who is rich in mercy he says now we are a part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attributed god you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now are you the sons of god and you always were the sons of god see for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before the before their well when when he before he even became material here on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes he knowed what your name would be he know the color of hair you would have he knowed all about you you know what else he knowed he know he knew what day and age you would be manifest in he knew that you would live in lima or near lima you don't all live in lima some of you are lucky enough to still be outside of lion but he knew where you would live and he knew you would live here in 2022 and he knew the world conditions and he knew the stresses and he knew and he knew the pressures and he knew the chaos that would break out and he knows the chaos that will break out he knew all of that amen so he he gave you all things that you would need in this day and how did he give it to us through the message of the hour and i say thank you lord jesus for giving me all things for we have an unction an anointing of the holy one and we know all things so tomorrow when you go to work tell them you know everything or just keep it scriptural and say i know all things i don't know everything but i know all things because heaven consists of the word and i am part of the word and i've received the full revelation of the word so heaven is open to me amen it's not it's not this mysterious someday when i get to heaven heaven is the word heaven consists of the word and the word has been revealed and you're caught up in the word and you're part of the word and you're part of the manifested word for this day you are linked with heaven you've received all things and i say thank you god for all things and i want to go on record and say i don't need anything else i don't need anything else this revelation of the word has provided squirrels this revelation of the word has been capable of providing when there was no provision this revelation of the word has been able to answer the questions of the critics in the face of the critics this this revelation of this word has been able to overcome this revelation this word has been demonstrated amen in a vessel of clay that demonstrated this revelation of the world and it was all things and everything and all things that we need to overcome in this day it's been given to us i don't think we could treasure it enough i don't think we could put enough value on it i don't think we could spend enough time with it amen let's turn to second corinthians chapter six i'm just going to finish with this scripture musicians if you want to come on up brother ben if you can make your way up 2nd corinthians chapter 6 verse 8. paul is talking and he's making a comparison let's back up to verse 5. he's talking about his ministry he says in stripes and imprisonments in tumults and labors and watchings and fastings in pureness by knowledge for six by long suffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeign by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet known as dying and behold we live a chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things in this world it may look like we have nothing but we are possessors of all things other people may call us ignorant you ever been called ignorant for what you believe but you're the one who knows all things who's really ignorant i'm i'm i i will confess i'm ignorant in some of the ways of the world i'm ignorant about many worldly things but there is something that i know and that's all things by the revelation of the hour i know who my father is do you know who your father is i know who i really am i know where i came from do you know where you came from do you know where you're going [Music] do you know your purpose on this earth to manifest the last they message this word and i'll tell you you friends you know all things and there's nothing we have to back down from there's nothing we have to cower in the face of we know all things and all things will carry us through the stabilizers have been put on the ship shall crest every wave don't be fearful don't run looking elsewhere for answers there's no other answers don't try to find other sources that have the answer there is no other answer the answer is the word and the word's been given to us and we have all things and as though in this world we possess nothing we have nothing but yet we possess all things praise god god's going to i believe allow circumstances to get in such a way that the all things become our only things the all things that we have if comforts get stripped away if if security and other things begin to be removed amen the all things that we possess will become our only things i said god help me not to get to a place where i'm stripped down everything's taken away before all things becomes everything to me but today let all things become my everything so that the all things that we have becomes everything man god bless you friends let's stand you know next time we need answers to questions the next time we need we need to know what to do in our situation just remember i have representation in heaven and i have something to receive truth with do you believe that i the next time the world gets confusing the next time you need an answer from god the next time you need something you need to know you need to know what to do what action to take what step to take your confusion you need something sorted out just remember i have representation in heaven and i have something in the soul to receive the revelation of the word with and i'm going to be okay and i'm going to keep digging in this word and saying god send down through that mystical channel what i need to strike the soul because it'll if if we need it it'll come from the word and god has already provided everything we have need of i thank him do you love him this is what we preach tonight will become more valuable as time goes on and it'll become more of our life and i say thank you lord this word will take me home you say but you need to know how to live in this life listen i'm more worried about living outside of this life than i am in this life this life has a way of taking care of itself i'm looking to live in that life amen i'm preparing my heart and my mind for the millennium i'm already looking forward i got one foot out the door i'm not worried about getting a better life down here my better life's coming i've given up on this i put all my hope and all my love and all my stock and the one that's to come amen god bless you friends let's bow our heads lord jesus we thank you for your word i pray that you would help us to realize what all things really are what you've given to us lord god i have a desire more than ever to put a greater value on the things that matter most lord jesus i ask that you would forgive me for the distractions that i so easily allow to come my way the things that my mind focuses on the things that i find myself meditating on the problems i try to solve myself lord i'm sorry for that i'm sorry for always running somewhere else for an answer when you've given me all things god i just pray that you continue as we as we feed on this word continue to open it to us lord give us the revelation that we have need of to overcome in this hour open it to us lord word by word keep pouring into us what we have need of lord that we might stand upon this word because when all else fails this word will never fail god we love you we thank you lord i pray that you would bless this assembly and bless all of your children that are here god as ange and i begin to travel we pray to take care of us and watch after us but i prayed lord that you would take care of this flock you would watch over them lord that you would bless the ministry that would minister in this prophet i pray that you would inspire them lord to preach the gospel that they would give real sheep food to the sheep lord and then lord we would come home and hear good reports from both sides of how what a blessing it was we're trusting you lord we're trusting your ways we ask that you would keep us lord as we walk this way and we thank you for
