[0:00] when jesus
[0:01] went to
[0:02] uh i can't remember what city it was but
[0:04] when he's walking through the city and
[0:06] he comes to a sycamore tree and he looks
[0:08] up and zacchaeus is up there says
[0:09] zacchaeus come down i'm going to your
[0:11] house today and he goes into zach he is
[0:13] his house and in zacchaeus's house amen
[0:16] zacchaeus begins to confess all of his
[0:18] sins i've done all this and i'm going to
[0:21] pay back if i stole anything i'll pay it
[0:23] back four times i'm going to give to the
[0:24] poor and he confesses his faults and he
[0:27] acknowledges he's going to make it right
[0:28] and jesus said salvation has come to
[0:31] this house today
[0:34] he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe
[0:36] anything in a former day
[0:38] he didn't ask zacchaeus to believe
[0:40] anything that would come in the future
[0:42] but because zacchaeus received the
[0:44] manifested word for his day that the
[0:46] high priest couldn't receive that the
[0:48] chief elders couldn't receive that the
[0:50] scribes and pharisees couldn't receive
[0:52] when zacchaeus could receive it confess
[0:54] his wrongs and repent he says salvation
[0:57] has come to this house today
[1:01] well how but but what if zacchaeus made
[1:03] a mistake later i don't think jesus is
[1:05] taking back his declaration of salvation
[1:08] amen
[1:09] i don't think jesus is playing a game
[1:11] saying zacchaeus you're saved but you
[1:13] know don't make a mistake and don't fail
[1:15] to receive me later no when zacchaeus
[1:17] had the capacity to recognize the living
[1:20] word he knew what was inside of
[1:22] zacchaeus
[1:24] he gets invited to simon's house and in
[1:26] simon's house amen simon pays him no
[1:28] respect simon gives him no uh washing of
[1:30] his feet no kiss no greeting amen and
[1:33] simon just invites him the house but has
[1:34] no respect for the word made flesh
[1:38] but there's a little harlot woman
[1:40] there's a little woman trapped and
[1:41] steeped in sin and she comes running in
[1:43] and breaks an alabaster box and washes
[1:45] his feet with her tears dries them with
[1:47] their hair and jesus looks at simon and
[1:50] he tells this woman though her sins are
[1:52] many they are all forgiving her
[1:56] she listen i i say this and don't get
[1:59] shocked at what i say jesus declared
[2:02] that all her sins were forgiven and we
[2:04] have no record in the bible of her
[2:06] asking forgiveness for her sins
[2:10] he didn't wait for her to say a sinner's
[2:12] prayer he didn't wait for her to ask
[2:14] forgiveness he didn't tell her to go to
[2:16] the temple
[2:18] there was nothing else she had to do all
[2:21] she had to do was recognize the word
[2:24] made flesh before her and she fell at
[2:26] his feet and began to worship the word
[2:28] that was made fast and she was getting a
[2:30] hold of the thai post amen
[2:32] and a few days after that that typos
[2:34] would go to calvary and shed blood and
[2:36] that shed blood was the price of her
[2:37] redemption but she got a hold of the
[2:39] typos here
[2:45] and jesus said he looked at her and says
[2:48] your faith has saved you
[2:52] saved by faith faith and want faith in
[2:56] the word that was presented to her in
[2:58] her day
