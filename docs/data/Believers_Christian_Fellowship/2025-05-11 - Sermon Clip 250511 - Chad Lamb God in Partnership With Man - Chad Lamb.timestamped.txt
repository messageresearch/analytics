[0:00] Paul was on partnership. Yes, sir.
[0:03] Remember Paul, Amen, was persecuting the
[0:05] church. He was running them into prison.
[0:07] He was scattering them all over. Amen.
[0:09] He was wreaking havoc on the church of
[0:11] God. That's what the Bible says. He was
[0:12] wreaking havoc on the church of God. And
[0:14] then one day, God was going to interrupt
[0:16] his plan because God had a plan for
[0:19] Saul. Yes. He was part of his
[0:22] predestinated plan. He was going to be
[0:23] part of the program. And no matter what
[0:25] he was doing now, didn't change what God
[0:28] had already foresaw. That's right. And
[0:30] he comes to Ananas and he says, "I I
[0:32] want you to go to Paul first." He smites
[0:34] him down on the road to Damascus. And he
[0:36] gives him a tremendous revelation. He
[0:37] said, "Why are you persecuting me?" And
[0:39] he said, "Uh, who are you, Lord?" He's
[0:41] looking at a pillar of fire, not a human
[0:44] body. He's looking at a pillar of fire.
[0:46] And the pillar of fire speaks and said,
[0:48] "Why do you persecute me?" He said, "Who
[0:50] are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm Jesus whom
[0:52] you persecute."
[0:54] Who was he persecuting? He was
[0:56] persecuting the church of Jesus. So when
[0:59] he was persecuting the church, Jesus
[1:01] says, "That's who I am.
[1:05] I am those people. They're on
[1:08] partnership with me. When you haul them
[1:11] to prison, you're taking me to prison.
[1:14] When you persecute them, you persecute
[1:16] me because I'm dwelling in them."
[1:22] So then he smitten blind. Ananas has to
[1:25] come to him and Ananas said how Lord how
[1:27] how can we do this and don't you know I
[1:30] love when people says that you know he
[1:33] didn't say don't you know but he says
[1:34] I've heard many things about this Saul
[1:37] how he's done this and this like he's
[1:39] teaching God
[1:41] something and God says he's a chosen
[1:44] vessel
[1:46] hallelujah
[1:48] he's a chosen vessel and I've already
[1:50] decided what works he's going to do he's
[1:53] going to take this light and he's going
[1:54] to shine it to the Gentiles and to
[1:56] kings. Amen. He comes and he gives him
[1:59] the commission and sends him off. You
[2:01] know what Paul says of
[2:03] himself? He said, "I am a light to the
[2:05] Gentiles."
[2:07] That's a prophecy out of Isaiah. You
[2:08] know who that prophecy applies to? Jesus
[2:11] Christ. But Paul said, Paul didn't say
[2:15] Jesus is. He said, "I am." Well, who's
[2:19] the I? Yeah. Was it the man or was it
[2:22] Christ in the man?
[2:26] God is on partnership with man.
[2:30] The message didn't go to the Gentiles
[2:32] until Paul carried it to the Gentiles.
[2:36] Paul had to stand. Paul had to open his
[2:39] mouth. Paul had to speak. Paul had to be
[2:42] willing to be stoned. And Paul, after he
[2:44] was stoned, had to get up. And Paul had
[2:46] to make the choice to walk back in
[2:48] again. Amen.
[2:50] That was Paul's part.
[2:53] All the supernatural, all the
[2:55] revelation, all the truth that was
[2:56] revealed, that was God's part.
[2:59] But
[3:01] Paul, Paul had to get on a boat.
[3:08] He had to brave storms. Paul had to get
[3:11] seasick.
[3:13] Paul had to walk.
[3:15] Paul had to stand. Paul had to talk.
[3:19] God supplied the anointing. God supplied
[3:21] the words. God supplied the revelation.
[3:24] God supplied the supernatural.
[3:27] But Paul had to carry it to the people.
