========================================

there's so many things when we get down to the heart of it there's so many things that we as human beings do to make us look good Cain his offering made Cain look good Abel was going to give a different kind of offering he was going to give an offering that pleased God and the only way to give an offering that would please God is he would have to die to everything he thought about what God wanted and wait for God to tell him what he wanted reveal it by Revelation and then just give God what God wanted with nothing extra when nothing lasts with nothing more but just to give God what he wanted but listen we're back in the same place today oh my goodness there's religious Spirits floating around all over the place amen and they're all around you and I amen so don't think they're somewhere else amen we can keep giving what makes us look good and look like Believers and say the right thing and look good or we can say I want to bring an offering by a genuine Revelation because I know who this is in this hour because he's revealed to me what he wants and what he wants is my life not my not just my money not just some time on Sunday and Wednesday he wants me because that's the plan and this day is to live in people so what does he want not a few hours a couple times a week a few dollars that come out of a paycheck that's not what he wants what does he want it's a revelation of what's going on in this day is going to require amen what we give indicates what we believe out of this message if I believe that this message is what God did through William Branham then I'm going to keep talking about what God did and how wonderful it was and all the wonderful things and I believe in the prophet and I'll keep living for self thinking everything's fine but what God wants in this day he got what he wanted in that day but what he wants in this day is a bride that he can pour himself completely into and she will be so much like him she will be him that's the that's the revelation of this hour Christ in you the hope of glory and you don't get there with a partial with a halfway withholding back for self so when it comes down to it amen when it comes down to it we've got to look at our lives and say what do I believe about this message and does my gift match my revelation
