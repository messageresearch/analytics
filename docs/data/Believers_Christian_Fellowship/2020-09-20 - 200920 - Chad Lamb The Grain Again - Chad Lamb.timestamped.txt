[4:01] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[4:06] god bless you brother amen god bless you
[4:12] both
[4:14] praise god let's all stand god has
[4:17] certainly been good
[4:19] to his children amen we're so excited to
[4:22] see the blessings of the lord
[4:24] amen let's take our bibles and turn to
[4:26] hebrews 13. we'll just start in the word
[4:28] of hebrews chapter 13.
[4:30] we're going to read 13 8 which is a very
[4:32] familiar scripture to us and we
[4:34] all know very well and as we're turning
[4:36] there i just want to remind you that
[4:37] brother emmanuel
[4:39] is today in northern idaho he'll he'll
[4:42] be preaching here shortly
[4:43] there this morning and traveling back
[4:46] then i presume tomorrow
[4:48] and then i also talked to brother
[4:50] benjamin siebold he's going to be going
[4:52] to arkansas
[4:52] next week for preaching for brother
[4:55] david morris
[4:56] in arkansas next week so be praying for
[4:58] him as well
[4:59] let's read here in hebrews 13 and verse
[5:02] 8
[5:04] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[5:07] today
[5:08] and forever i don't know i don't know
[5:11] i've never counted how many times
[5:12] brother brenda quoted the scripture a
[5:14] part of it but it's got to be
[5:16] i mean it's it's got to be 100 or more
[5:19] and this was a theme to him and a theme
[5:21] in his ministry
[5:22] and so this scripture it's it's easy to
[5:25] read
[5:26] it doesn't take very long but i think
[5:27] the full impact of that is still
[5:29] unfolding to us
[5:31] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[5:34] we thank you for this day and for this
[5:36] word and as we look into your word
[5:38] i pray you'd open it for us lord we as
[5:40] human beings lord with the ability to
[5:42] read we can read we can read printed
[5:44] words on printed
[5:45] on paper lord but but it takes you to
[5:47] open up
[5:48] the understanding to us it takes you to
[5:50] give us divine revelation on the word
[5:52] we pray you would do that this morning i
[5:54] pray to you be with our brother emmanuel
[5:56] lord as he's ministering this morning in
[5:58] idaho
[5:58] speak through him use the vessel for
[6:00] your glory and may your bride there be
[6:02] edified as well
[6:04] we give you preeminence this morning in
[6:06] jesus name we pray
[6:07] amen you can all have your seeds
[6:10] let's turn over to to the book of john
[6:14] the gospel of john
[6:16] john chapter one
[6:20] and we'll begin at verse one so we're
[6:22] gonna be reading
[6:23] these two super familiar passages of
[6:26] scripture
[6:27] to us but they just they always get
[6:30] richer every time
[6:32] john 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[6:36] and the word was with god and the word
[6:38] was god
[6:39] the same was in the beginning with god
[6:42] then you go over to verse 14
[6:43] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[6:45] among us and we beheld his glory
[6:47] the glories of the only begotten of the
[6:49] father full of grace
[6:51] and truth so we read these two
[6:53] scriptures and we want to look at these
[6:55] two together this morning
[6:57] amen we want to look at jesus christ
[6:59] amen the same yesterday
[7:01] today and forever and we know that jesus
[7:04] christ
[7:04] is is the word made manifest amen and we
[7:07] know in the beginning was the word and
[7:09] the word was with god and the word was
[7:11] god and the word was made flesh and
[7:13] dwelt among us
[7:14] amen and so we want to look at the
[7:16] ministry of jesus christ
[7:18] amen but maybe in a broader way than
[7:20] just the three and a half year ministry
[7:22] he had or the 33 year
[7:23] life span that he had in flesh but it's
[7:25] jesus christ the same yesterday
[7:27] today and forever brother madam says in
[7:31] the message the unchanging god working
[7:33] in an unexpected way from 1962 he says
[7:37] he was brought in the way that israel
[7:39] thought he would be issued in
[7:41] he was not brought in the way that
[7:42] israel thought he would be issued in
[7:44] they thought he'd be a mighty king with
[7:46] a stick in his hand and go out and beat
[7:48] the romans over the head with it but
[7:50] that wasn't god's way
[7:52] that wasn't even the scripture for him
[7:53] to do it in that coming
[7:55] the next coming is when he's going to do
[7:57] that they've got the first and second
[7:59] coming mixed up together
[8:01] so he come then lowly meek setting on a
[8:03] mule riding in
[8:05] and he come out of the smallest city
[8:07] amongst all the big provinces
[8:09] and all the scriptures just fulfilled of
[8:11] his coming the way he will come
[8:13] but they failed to see it see but he did
[8:16] the messianic
[8:17] messier eik sign provided that he would
[8:21] prove that he was messiah and they
[8:23] rejected it
[8:24] because he come in an unexpected way to
[8:26] them
[8:28] now listen he didn't come in an
[8:29] unexpected way because the scripture
[8:31] said how he would come
[8:33] he came in an unexpected way to them
[8:36] so it wasn't god in an unexpected way it
[8:38] was god in an unexpected
[8:40] way to them amen
[8:44] now if they had just been willing to
[8:47] accept him on the basis that god sent
[8:49] him
[8:50] 1958 he says can we see jesus
[8:54] in the message can we see jesus then if
[8:55] christ manifested himself
[8:57] in the closing of the jewish
[8:58] dispensation now listen close
[9:01] the way he did when he manifested
[9:02] himself to the jews
[9:04] because they were looking for him to
[9:05] come and fail to recognize him
[9:08] is that true now the gentiles was not
[9:10] looking for him to come we were heathens
[9:12] in those days worshiping idols
[9:14] but at the close of the dispensation of
[9:15] the jews when they had rejected him the
[9:18] way he manifested himself at the close
[9:20] of the
[9:20] jewish dispensation he will have to do
[9:23] the same thing at the closing of the
[9:24] gentile dispensation
[9:26] or he did wrong for manifesting himself
[9:28] the way he did in his power at the close
[9:30] of the jews
[9:31] and would not do it at would not do it
[9:34] at the gentiles you understand clearly
[9:36] the brother of them says he become at
[9:38] the end of the jewish dispensation and
[9:40] he showed
[9:40] the sign of the messiah and then he
[9:42] discerned their thoughts and intents and
[9:44] he had all the manifestations inside of
[9:46] the messiah
[9:47] amen if he did that at the end of the
[9:49] jewish dispensation he will have to do
[9:51] it again at the end of the gentile
[9:52] dispensation
[9:55] so it's got to be the same thing it's
[9:57] got to be the same display and the same
[9:59] chance amen
[10:00] but he's not he's going to do the same
[10:02] thing he's going to do it the same way
[10:04] but he's not going to do it in the same
[10:05] form
[10:08] amen so he's going to do it but he may
[10:11] not do it
[10:12] according to what the expected way
[10:15] brother bam says in 1962 why i'm against
[10:17] organized religion
[10:18] they believed there was a coming messiah
[10:21] oh them jews they sure
[10:22] but when jesus come the way he did they
[10:25] said
[10:26] that can't be him
[10:28] [Laughter]
[10:29] i love that because when we start
[10:31] talking about the way jesus is coming
[10:33] our day
[10:33] they say that can't be it because this
[10:35] is supposed to happen that's supposed to
[10:36] happen
[10:37] and he's supposed to drive out the roman
[10:39] and you're getting things mixed up
[10:41] you're getting comings mixed up and
[10:43] you're getting dispensations crossed
[10:45] and you're getting out of kilter with
[10:46] the sequence of the word
[10:49] so that that can't be him they fail to
[10:52] understand the word
[10:54] now jesus didn't come contrary to the
[10:55] word did he
[10:57] but he came contrary to the organization
[10:59] interpretation of the word
[11:02] moses didn't come contrary to the word
[11:04] he came exactly with the word but cora
[11:07] failed to see it
[11:08] and all down through it's been that way
[11:11] we live in the same day amen the same
[11:14] things are going on now what's going on
[11:15] then
[11:16] he says in the message who is this
[11:17] melchizedek from 1965
[11:20] she said sir i proceeded out on a
[11:22] prophet and he's speaking to the
[11:23] samaritan woman at the well i perceive
[11:25] that they were a prophet she said
[11:27] we haven't had one for 400 years now we
[11:29] know that the messiah is coming and when
[11:31] the messiah comes
[11:32] that's what he's going to do that was
[11:35] the sign of the messiah
[11:36] for he was the son of man that's what
[11:39] he's going to do when he comes
[11:41] you must be his prophet he said i am he
[11:44] nobody else could say that she dropped
[11:47] that water pot and run into the city and
[11:49] said come see a man who told me
[11:50] what i'd done isn't this the very
[11:52] messiah
[11:53] now remember he promised to do the same
[11:56] thing at the end of the gentile race
[11:59] he's going to do the same thing but it's
[12:02] not going to look
[12:03] the same way
[12:06] but he's going to do the same thing the
[12:09] jews had four thousand years to look for
[12:11] that messiah
[12:12] four thousand years of teaching he was
[12:14] coming and what he would do when he got
[12:16] there
[12:17] and they failed to see him or failed to
[12:19] recognize it
[12:20] and when he made himself known in the
[12:22] very bible terms that he said he would
[12:24] then he had when he had been a theophany
[12:27] and then become flesh and dwelt among
[12:29] them they failed to see it and
[12:31] called his works the works of the devil
[12:34] now we've had two thousand years of
[12:36] teaching coming down through the roman
[12:37] catholic church
[12:38] after the apostles then we come down
[12:40] through the roman catholic the greek and
[12:42] so forth on down to luther's age in
[12:44] wesley what more
[12:45] 900 different organizations come down
[12:48] they had all these ages teaching
[12:50] now he promised just before the end time
[12:53] would come that the picture of sodom and
[12:54] gomorrah would again
[12:56] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[12:58] it be at the coming of the end time
[13:00] the son of man will reveal himself again
[13:03] yet a little while and the world won't
[13:05] see me no more yet ye shall see me
[13:07] for i personal pronoun i will be with
[13:10] you even in you to the consummation
[13:12] the end of the world i will be with you
[13:15] he is the same
[13:16] yesterday today and forever
[13:20] oh my goodness he's the same yesterday
[13:22] today forever but he says
[13:23] the world won't see me but you'll see me
[13:25] you'll see me because i'll be in you
[13:27] i'll be with you amen i will be there
[13:30] not another person not the second person
[13:33] but the same person
[13:34] in another form
[13:38] the world couldn't see it but they could
[13:40] see it
[13:42] because he's the same yesterday today
[13:43] and forever
[13:45] you see the samaritan was actually from
[13:47] my last night's sermon was
[13:48] hagar see a perverted type the jew was
[13:50] sarah
[13:51] the saraite but the gentiles of mary the
[13:54] royal seed abraham's royal seed
[13:56] now it's promised that in these last
[13:58] days that this same god
[14:00] this same christ would come back here
[14:03] and reveal himself
[14:04] as son of man i'm going to read that
[14:07] last sentence again
[14:08] now it's promised that in these last
[14:10] days that the
[14:12] same god
[14:15] this same christ would come back here
[14:18] and reveal himself
[14:20] as son of man so the same god the same
[14:23] christ
[14:24] would come back here
[14:28] and reveal himself as the son of man
[14:30] he's going to do it just like he did at
[14:31] the end of the jewish dispensation
[14:33] amen he come and he revealed the
[14:35] thoughts and intents of the heart he
[14:36] showed the sign of the messiah
[14:38] he sowed the same thing when god came
[14:40] down elohim and flesh
[14:41] on the plains of memory what he showed
[14:43] to abraham he's going to show again to
[14:45] abraham's elect seed
[14:47] at the end of the the jewish
[14:49] dispensation and he's going to come back
[14:51] and do the exact same thing
[14:52] to to the same seed which is abraham's
[14:56] royal seed
[14:57] he's going to show them the sign of the
[14:58] messiah the same thing that he did on
[15:00] the plains of memory
[15:01] so that they will know like abraham knew
[15:04] like they like the royal sea knew at the
[15:06] end of the jewish dispensation and like
[15:07] we know at the end of the gentile
[15:09] dispensation
[15:10] that that that is god in flesh
[15:16] it's just a different form a different
[15:19] manner of manifestation
[15:20] but it's the same god it's the same
[15:24] christ
[15:26] now let's turn together over to ii
[15:28] timothy
[15:30] i'm going to read two scriptures back to
[15:31] back
[15:39] second timothy chapter 3
[15:46] 2 timothy 3 and 8.
[15:49] now as janice and jammers withstood
[15:51] moses so do these also resist the truth
[15:54] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[15:56] concerning the faith
[15:58] brother is going to have a lot to say
[15:59] about this in a moment in the quotes i'm
[16:01] going to read
[16:02] but janice and jammers withstood moses
[16:04] so do these also resist
[16:06] the truth when they were resisting moses
[16:09] they were resisting the truth they
[16:10] weren't resisting the man
[16:13] the man was just a vessel god was going
[16:15] to use amen but when they resisted moses
[16:18] they were resisting the truth
[16:19] because moses was doing what god told
[16:21] him to do so he was the very
[16:23] manifestation of the spoken word of god
[16:25] and when they resisted that they were
[16:27] resisting god they were resisting the
[16:30] truth
[16:30] so as janice and jamers withstood moses
[16:33] so do these also resist the truth men of
[16:36] corrupt minds
[16:37] reprobate concerning the faith
[16:40] so so now brother bam says in the le
[16:43] in the last days you're going to have a
[16:44] return of janice and jambries and he
[16:46] said if the
[16:47] and this is what brother baptist says in
[16:48] the anointed was at the end time
[16:50] he said if it's going to be at the end
[16:51] time it's got to be after the opening of
[16:54] those seals
[16:56] because that marks the end time amen the
[16:59] the
[16:59] the ministry of the seventh angel is
[17:01] sounding forth will be the mystery will
[17:02] be finished
[17:03] at the end time amen so now it's got to
[17:06] be after the opening of the seven seals
[17:08] that this is made manifest now
[17:11] jamberry's withstood moses so do these
[17:12] also resist the truth
[17:14] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[17:16] concerning the faith now let's look turn
[17:18] to luke
[17:20] chapter 18.
[17:25] luke 18
[17:29] and verse 8.
[17:33] i tell you that he will avenge them
[17:35] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[17:37] man cometh shall he
[17:38] find faith on the earth now remember
[17:41] genesis and jammers will reprobate
[17:43] concerning the faith
[17:45] now he's saying nevertheless when the
[17:49] son of man cometh
[17:50] shall he find faith on the earth
[17:53] now brother branham told us that there's
[17:55] going to be a revealing of the son of
[17:57] man
[17:57] and the revealing of the son of man is
[17:59] the coming of the son of man
[18:01] the son of man comes to reveal himself
[18:04] the same god the same christ comes
[18:07] as son of man so now he says when the
[18:10] son of man
[18:11] cometh now we know when that is when the
[18:14] world's in a sodom condition
[18:15] when once again elohim steps down in the
[18:17] flesh and turns his back to the crowd
[18:19] and begins telling what's going on in
[18:21] the tent behind him we realize we've
[18:23] come to the same place
[18:26] and he says now uh nevertheless when the
[18:29] son of man
[18:30] cometh shall he find faith on the earth
[18:34] mother branham says in the anointed ones
[18:36] at the end time
[18:37] said it reprobates concerning the truth
[18:39] concerning the faith
[18:40] the faith there there's only one faith
[18:42] that's right concerning the faith
[18:43] reprobates now that's the question
[18:46] here's where i want to go to in
[18:48] revelations 10
[18:49] we'll go to in a minute in a few minutes
[18:51] and another scripture verse he said
[18:53] in the days of the message of the
[18:54] seventh angel the mystery of god ought
[18:56] to be finished
[18:58] here is the question is if you follow in
[19:00] that line in this hour
[19:02] will it be finished will i find the
[19:04] faith
[19:05] will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time
[19:08] restore the faith of the children back
[19:10] to the faith of the fathers
[19:11] the original word now i i'm
[19:14] i mark this down and i highlight this
[19:16] because i want to stop here for a minute
[19:18] brother branham's asking a question he
[19:20] said will i find faith will malachi 4 be
[19:22] fulfilled in this time
[19:24] restore the faith of the children back
[19:25] to the faith of the fathers the original
[19:28] the word now brother ben is not saying
[19:31] will god send elijah god had already
[19:33] sent elijah
[19:34] that was well established brother
[19:36] branham already knew he's getting here
[19:38] he's in july of 1965
[19:40] he's not questioning whether or not the
[19:42] forerunner will come
[19:43] he's not questioning whether or not the
[19:45] spirit of elijah has come
[19:48] he's asking whether malachi 4
[19:51] will be fulfilled because the fulfilling
[19:53] is malachi 4
[19:54] is a people on the earth who go back to
[19:56] the original word
[20:00] so he's not saying you know will will
[20:02] god send that elijah
[20:04] we'll we'll you know will the forerunner
[20:06] come
[20:07] not that's not what he's asking the son
[20:09] of man is come now he's asking really
[20:11] fine
[20:11] faith on the earth that's the question
[20:15] because janice and james will reprobate
[20:17] concerning
[20:18] the faith what faith the original faith
[20:20] of the original father's the original
[20:22] word
[20:24] that's what they were reprobate
[20:25] concerning is that
[20:27] faith that the the faith of the children
[20:29] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[20:31] brother said the original word
[20:33] so brother baby's not questioning
[20:35] whether malachi
[20:36] 4 and the revelation the the prophecy of
[20:39] malachi 4 has come
[20:40] he's well established in that fact and
[20:43] he knows by the opening of the seven
[20:45] seals that that has confirmed malachi
[20:48] 4 has come elijah has come
[20:51] but now the question is will malachi 4
[20:54] be fulfilled because that's not brother
[20:57] branham's portion amen
[20:58] his portion was elijah the forerunner
[21:01] amen revealing the son of man
[21:03] but there has to be a people on the
[21:05] earth that will receive
[21:06] that faith of the father turn back to
[21:09] the original word
[21:10] and that will be the fulfilling of
[21:11] malachi 4.
[21:14] and that's where janice and james are
[21:16] reprobate
[21:20] that right there is where the reprobate
[21:22] amen they're not
[21:23] reprobate amen brother bam said they're
[21:25] not reprobate in their life their life
[21:27] is fine
[21:31] they're not reparating their christian
[21:32] works they're not reprobating
[21:34] manifestations
[21:36] they could do all that moses could do
[21:37] they were not reprobate and healing they
[21:39] were not reparate
[21:40] in deliverance they were not reprobating
[21:42] all that they will reprobate concerning
[21:44] the
[21:45] faith which is the fulfillment of
[21:46] malachi 4.
[21:50] so brotherhood says will that's the
[21:53] question
[21:53] when the son of man comes because he
[21:55] knows he's right here he's at the coming
[21:57] of the son of man
[21:58] the revealing of the son of man and
[22:00] malachi 4 has come the forerunner is
[22:02] gone
[22:02] amen now the mystery should be finished
[22:05] now the question is
[22:06] will it be the question is will malachi
[22:09] 4 be fulfilled
[22:12] and i say absolutely right here if
[22:15] nowhere else god let it be fulfilled
[22:16] right here
[22:17] turn my heart back to that original word
[22:19] because i want the word and nothing else
[22:23] not one drop more not one drop less i
[22:26] just want the original word and all of
[22:27] it
[22:29] he goes on in the same quote he says now
[22:32] he just finished saying malachi 4
[22:34] will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time
[22:36] restore the faith of the children back
[22:38] to the faith of the fathers the original
[22:40] the word reprobates jameson chambers
[22:44] as they withstood now also listen ii
[22:46] timothy 3 8
[22:48] withstood moses also in the last days
[22:50] these same reprobates would come
[22:53] now see where it says here having a form
[22:55] of godliness
[22:56] anointed ones you go back and read it
[23:00] when you get home so that i can finish
[23:02] out this morning
[23:03] reprobates concerning not reprobates in
[23:05] living
[23:06] their fine cultured man
[23:10] not reprobates in character not
[23:13] reprobates in christian works
[23:18] they resisted the truth
[23:22] and they will reprobate concerning the
[23:25] faith
[23:26] the one that the children have been the
[23:28] faith that the children have been turned
[23:30] back to
[23:30] the original word which came at the
[23:33] opening of the seals so
[23:36] all of this comes into manifestation at
[23:38] the opening of the seals
[23:41] because how can you be reprobate
[23:42] concerning the faith until the faith has
[23:44] been restored
[23:46] and when the faith has been restored now
[23:48] you can be reprobate concerning the
[23:49] faith
[23:50] and being shown that you've been
[23:51] resisting the truth
[23:53] because another prophet has come in the
[23:55] same fashion as moses
[23:56] amen and they resisted moses now when
[23:58] they resisted this prophet in the end
[24:00] time amen they're resisting the truth
[24:02] and been found reprobate concerning the
[24:04] faith
[24:06] let's turn to the book of acts now acts
[24:16] 19.
[24:25] acts 19 verse 1
[24:31] and it came to pass that while apostle
[24:33] was at corinth paul having passed
[24:35] through the upper coast come to ephesus
[24:37] and find his certain disciples
[24:39] he said unto them have you received the
[24:41] holy ghost since you believed and they
[24:42] said unto him
[24:43] we have not so much as heard whether
[24:45] whether there be any holy ghost
[24:47] and he said unto them unto what were
[24:49] then were you baptized
[24:50] and they said unto john's baptism then
[24:53] said paul
[24:54] john verily baptized with the baptism of
[24:56] repentance saying unto the people that
[24:58] they should believe on him
[25:00] which should come after him that is on
[25:02] christ jesus
[25:04] when they heard this they were baptized
[25:06] in the name of the lord jesus
[25:07] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[25:09] them the holy ghost came on them and
[25:11] they spake with tongues and prophesied
[25:13] and all the men were about 12.
[25:16] brother ben's going to pick up this same
[25:17] scripture he's going to repeat a portion
[25:19] of this
[25:20] over here in the um the church age book
[25:22] in the section
[25:23] on the revelation of jesus christ
[25:26] he says and it came to pass well paul
[25:28] while apollos was at
[25:30] corinth paul having passed through the
[25:32] upper coast came to ephesus and finding
[25:34] certain disciples
[25:36] he said unto them have you received the
[25:37] holy ghost since you believed
[25:39] and they said we have not so much as
[25:40] heard whether to be any holy ghost
[25:42] he said unto what were you baptized and
[25:44] they said unto john's baptism
[25:46] then said paul john verily baptized with
[25:49] the baptism of repentance
[25:51] saying unto the people that they should
[25:53] believe on him which should come after
[25:55] him
[25:57] now paul the apostle are not paul
[26:00] paul is coming to them and they're
[26:02] referring back to john the baptist the
[26:04] forerunner
[26:04] of his first coming and they're they're
[26:08] they are stuck in the forerunner's
[26:10] ministry
[26:13] you understand these are good people
[26:16] these are real believers these are
[26:17] genuine seed
[26:18] because when they heard more they
[26:20] accepted it right quickly and were
[26:22] baptized in jesus name
[26:23] this is not these are not reprobates
[26:25] concerning the faith these are not
[26:27] individuals who are resisting the truth
[26:28] amen they just not they haven't heard it
[26:30] all amen they heard the forerunner part
[26:33] they grabbed a hold of the forerunner
[26:34] part they were living the forerunner
[26:37] part
[26:37] they were obedient to the forerunner
[26:39] part
[26:42] amen and even you know these were this
[26:44] brother says he goes on to say these
[26:46] were disciples of apollos and apollos
[26:48] was a great scholar
[26:49] and he was going into the synagogues and
[26:50] burning them up showing
[26:52] amen that the messiah would come that
[26:54] jesus would come amen but aquila and
[26:56] priscilla
[26:56] had to take him and show him the way of
[26:58] life more plainly
[27:01] like he he didn't get to the next step
[27:03] he had got to the forerunner to elijah
[27:06] coming amen to lay straight to paths and
[27:08] he had got to malachi 3
[27:10] he had got the prophecy in isaiah he had
[27:12] seen the forerunner come
[27:14] amen but he hadn't gone beyond the
[27:16] forerunner yet
[27:17] but he was not he was not a reprobate he
[27:20] was not a genus and jamboree
[27:21] he was a true predestinated seed of god
[27:26] and he had come to the point and now
[27:28] aquila and priscilla
[27:29] amen they they don't chastise him they
[27:32] don't scold him they don't make him feel
[27:33] like an unbeliever they just say
[27:35] hey you're doing good let me show you
[27:37] something else
[27:40] because what john was here to do john
[27:42] came to forerun
[27:44] he did that but what he forerunned has
[27:46] already come
[27:50] praise god he said when
[27:54] he goes on it reads the scripture and he
[27:56] says these good people at ephesus had
[27:58] heard about the coming messiah
[28:00] john had preached him they were baptized
[28:02] and repentant of sin
[28:04] looking forward to believing on jesus
[28:10] oh these dear folks at ephesus were fine
[28:12] people
[28:14] and if anyone had a right to feel secure
[28:17] they did
[28:18] notice how far they had come they had
[28:20] come all the way up to accepting the
[28:21] coming messiah
[28:23] they were ready for him but don't you
[28:25] see that in spite of that
[28:26] they had missed him he had come
[28:30] and gone now
[28:34] listen these were like i said not
[28:35] reprobates
[28:37] not resisting the truth they just
[28:40] hadn't heard the rest of it yet they
[28:44] and he says look how secure they ought
[28:46] to have fell because they caught the
[28:48] prophecy amen
[28:49] they caught the forerunner ministry they
[28:51] recognized john the baptist and what he
[28:53] was doing
[28:54] and they were repented of their sins
[28:56] waiting for the messiah to come
[28:57] oh friends there's many times in the
[29:00] message we've
[29:01] caught that god has sent a malachi 4
[29:03] elijah
[29:04] god has sent amen his word in this day
[29:07] god has fulfilled that portion amen
[29:09] and now we sit so many times repentant
[29:12] and washed out and free from
[29:13] denominational teaching
[29:14] and waiting waiting waiting waiting for
[29:17] something to happen
[29:18] amen for the lord to come for something
[29:20] to happen when it's
[29:21] already happened friends
[29:24] amen and sometimes when somebody's stuck
[29:27] in the forerunner ministry
[29:29] amen they're living it amen they're
[29:30] believing it they're repented they're
[29:32] washed out
[29:33] amen they're standing there waiting for
[29:35] the next step amen all they need
[29:37] sometimes is somebody in love
[29:39] like aquila priscilla and say hey let me
[29:41] show you the way of life more plainly
[29:43] more perfectly can i share with you what
[29:46] i see
[29:48] because they're not reprobates they're
[29:50] not resisting the truth these are
[29:52] children of god
[29:53] they just need to hear amen that the the
[29:56] the revealing of the son of man was the
[29:58] coming of the son of man the same god
[30:00] same christ has come back to reveal
[30:01] himself the son of man
[30:05] don't miss it don't miss it
[30:09] good people feeling secure don't miss it
[30:14] because what john 4 run has come
[30:18] and i'll say what elijah has for run has
[30:20] come
[30:27] let's turn to matthew 16.
[30:39] matthew 16 and 13.
[30:50] matthew 16 13 when jesus came into the
[30:53] coast of caesarea philippi he asked his
[30:55] disciples saying
[30:56] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[30:59] and they said some say thou art john the
[31:01] baptist some elias others jeremiah
[31:04] are one of the prophets he said unto
[31:06] them but whom say ye that i
[31:08] am and simon peter answered
[31:11] and said thou art the christ the son of
[31:13] the living god
[31:15] now i'm going to keep reading and
[31:17] brethren and
[31:18] jesus says and jesus answered and said
[31:20] unto him blessed art thou simon barjona
[31:22] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[31:24] unto thee
[31:25] but my father which is in heaven and i
[31:27] say unto thee
[31:29] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[31:31] will build my church
[31:32] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[31:34] against it
[31:36] and brother rem says in the message
[31:38] anointing ones at the end time
[31:40] said these trees this true vine and
[31:42] false vine you've heard me preach on
[31:44] that since from years ago
[31:46] how they've grown up together brought
[31:48] them in individuals and showed
[31:50] that from cain and abel the two vines
[31:52] that met in an altar both of them
[31:53] religious
[31:54] both of them anointed both of them
[31:55] desiring life and worshipping the same
[31:57] god and one was rejected and the other
[31:59] received
[32:01] and the only way that the one that was
[32:02] received could have done anything
[32:04] different from his brother
[32:06] it has it was revealed to him for the
[32:09] bible said by faith hebrews 11th chapter
[32:11] by faith abel offered unto god
[32:13] or more excellent sacrifice than that of
[32:15] cain which god testified that he was
[32:17] righteous
[32:18] so brother of em said there's two
[32:19] brothers here's two twins
[32:21] amen they're on the earth both desiring
[32:23] to worship god both working to bring a
[32:25] sacrifice doing all the religious
[32:26] services
[32:27] amen but one brought an appropriate
[32:30] offering and the other one did not
[32:32] amen and the only way that abel could do
[32:34] different than cain was by revelation
[32:37] that's it and cain although he got
[32:39] instruction he could never catch the
[32:41] revelation
[32:42] because god gave him the instructions
[32:44] just do what abel did
[32:46] he got the instructions from god he got
[32:49] the thus saith the lord from god
[32:51] but what he could not catch was that
[32:53] revelation and when he could not catch
[32:55] the revelation
[32:56] he could not keep the word
[33:00] that's why you see people sometimes in
[33:01] the message they struggle to keep the
[33:03] basics of the message
[33:04] i mean uh staying away from tv and and
[33:07] hair and
[33:08] and and make up and dress and conduct
[33:11] and entertainments and all these basic
[33:13] basic basic things
[33:14] and you realize the revelation hasn't
[33:16] struck yet
[33:18] because once the revelation struck
[33:20] strikes it's totally different picture
[33:22] everything looks different everything
[33:24] feels different your whole attitude
[33:25] changes your whole desires have shifted
[33:28] it's not anymore trying by a form of
[33:30] government and and by a a
[33:32] code of rules amen trying to line up and
[33:34] mesh myself
[33:35] into this to be a believer no just be a
[33:37] believer and let god by revelation
[33:39] quicken the seed on the inside
[33:41] and you'll find out the desires for
[33:43] those things just begin to melt away
[33:47] and so abel the only reason he could do
[33:49] different was by revelation the only
[33:50] reason he could receive revelation is
[33:52] because he was a seed of god
[33:55] cain he could get the instruction that's
[33:58] why
[33:58] you can give instruction until you're
[34:00] blue in the face don't cut your hair
[34:02] don't wear makeup don't dress him
[34:04] honestly don't tell dirty jokes don't
[34:06] get caught up in worldly entertainment
[34:08] and you can teach and teach and teach
[34:10] and teach and finally
[34:11] cain will break under that pressure and
[34:13] he'll kill his brother
[34:18] how many times does that happen you
[34:21] preach legalism i can't do that there's
[34:23] no grace here i'm leaving
[34:26] what has cain done he's killed his
[34:28] brother
[34:32] and brother we have to preach those
[34:34] things it's not that we should not
[34:36] preach those things
[34:37] but understanding amen you'll never
[34:39] preach it in such a way
[34:41] that you'll get cain to get catch a
[34:43] revelation
[34:45] you preach it so that abel can catch the
[34:48] revelation
[34:50] so we always preach it but never he said
[34:53] that's why you don't have to preach it
[34:54] harder you don't have to preach it firm
[34:56] or
[34:56] and you don't have to get angry about it
[34:58] you don't have to scream and shout
[34:59] and you don't have to tell people you're
[35:00] going to go to hell and you're going to
[35:02] burn and it's going to be horrible it's
[35:03] going to be the most terrible thing ever
[35:05] you don't have to do that to get able to
[35:07] catch the revelation
[35:08] [Applause]
[35:09] [Music]
[35:11] so many times i think by the
[35:12] forcefulness and the threats and the
[35:14] fear-mongering amen that comes through
[35:16] preaching sometimes
[35:17] i think it's a human effort by human
[35:19] government to get somebody to look like
[35:21] a believer
[35:24] what's the point of looking like a
[35:25] believer if you're not a believer
[35:29] be a believer and god will make you look
[35:33] like a believer
[35:35] praise be to god it's a revelation all
[35:38] of it's by
[35:39] revelation we catch a higher order of
[35:43] understanding
[35:44] our eyes become open and now all of a
[35:46] sudden it's not about
[35:48] it's not about well how short short and
[35:50] how tight is ty
[35:51] all of a sudden it's like wait wait a
[35:53] second
[35:55] i get the picture i'm jesus christ i'm
[35:58] the temple
[35:59] i'm tabernacling deity everybody who
[36:01] sees me is gonna
[36:02] this is the image of jesus christ on the
[36:04] earth today oh now i understand why it
[36:07] matters
[36:10] praise be to god so he says
[36:15] now the only way
[36:20] that
[36:23] that he could have done anything
[36:24] different from his brother was rece
[36:26] it was revealed to him by faith abel
[36:28] offered unto god a more excellent
[36:30] sacrifice than that of cain
[36:31] which god testified that he was
[36:33] righteous jesus said the spiritual
[36:35] revelation of who
[36:36] he was who does man say i the son of man
[36:40] am he said peter he said peter said thou
[36:44] art the christ the son of the living god
[36:46] blessed out there simon simon son of
[36:49] jonas
[36:49] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[36:51] you but my father which is in heaven has
[36:53] revealed it upon this
[36:54] rock i'll build my church what the true
[36:57] revelation of the word
[37:01] there is the true vine again able by
[37:04] faith
[37:05] so now what what he's saying is we don't
[37:08] have to repeat what peter said
[37:11] because if we just repeat what peter
[37:13] said with
[37:14] the same understanding that peter had
[37:17] that day
[37:18] we are still going to miss the true
[37:21] revelation
[37:22] of the word and the church is not built
[37:24] on repeating
[37:25] what peter said with the understanding
[37:27] peter had
[37:30] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[37:31] it's not wrong to repeat the scriptures
[37:33] but amen we have to go
[37:34] amen we have to we have to receive the
[37:37] true revelation of the word in our day
[37:39] and when we recognize that that is
[37:41] christ then we're saying the same thing
[37:43] peter said
[37:46] so peter's talking about the
[37:48] manifestation of jesus christ in flesh
[37:51] god in one body and he's looking at god
[37:53] in one body
[37:54] he asks who do men say that i the son of
[37:57] man am and then they answer well some
[37:58] are this and some are that it's really a
[38:00] divided camp they really haven't come to
[38:02] any conclusion
[38:03] but who do you say by your own personal
[38:05] revelation
[38:06] who do you say that i am he said thou
[38:08] art christ the son of the living god
[38:09] and he said flesh and blood you're
[38:11] blessed because flesh and blood didn't
[38:13] tell you that
[38:15] but my father which is heaven and upon
[38:17] this rock amen
[38:18] not the rock of being able to say that
[38:20] jesus christ 2 000 years ago was the son
[38:23] of god
[38:24] my goodness billions of people can
[38:26] confess that in this day
[38:27] but that's not the rock that's not the
[38:29] rock that he's built his church on
[38:31] he's built his church on the solid
[38:33] unmoving rock
[38:34] of true revelation from the father for
[38:37] the word may
[38:38] manifest in their day it's what held
[38:40] moses's church
[38:42] it's what held noah's church it's what
[38:43] held abraham's church
[38:47] it's the same thing and upon this rock
[38:50] now it's funny that jesus asked this
[38:53] question
[38:55] who did they say i the son of man
[39:01] because we've come right back to the son
[39:03] of man again
[39:06] brother branham said we've got a son of
[39:08] god through the church we had son of man
[39:10] and jesus christ son of god through the
[39:12] church ages
[39:12] amen moving to son of david so there's
[39:15] been three names
[39:17] son of man jesus christ son of god
[39:20] amen the holy ghost through the church
[39:22] ages amen and son of david when he
[39:24] establishes the kingdom on earth through
[39:26] the millennium
[39:28] but he said just between son of god
[39:31] and son of david he comes as son of man
[39:34] again
[39:40] so now it's appropriate in this day to
[39:42] ask the question
[39:45] who do you say this son of man is not
[39:48] that one this one
[39:53] it's still an appropriate question to be
[39:55] asked today
[39:56] not who was the son of man that peter
[39:59] was talking about it's the same son of
[40:01] man
[40:01] he's come to the churches and son of god
[40:03] but he's come back amen the same god the
[40:05] same christ
[40:06] came back in the revealing of the son of
[40:08] man and who do
[40:10] you say this son of man is
[40:13] because the way you answer that question
[40:16] is going to determine
[40:17] what seed is on the inside because only
[40:20] the seed can catch a revelation of who
[40:21] the son of man is
[40:25] praise be to god
[40:29] and we may for years like many of us we
[40:32] may
[40:33] have been moving our way through
[40:35] dispensations amen
[40:36] and come from the church eight
[40:38] dispensations and and see
[40:40] a a forerunner coming to forerun is
[40:43] coming
[40:45] and we see that forerunner and we catch
[40:47] it and we believe it and we receive it
[40:49] with all of our hearts and we go to
[40:50] manifest it and live it and we come to
[40:52] it
[40:53] looking forward saying oh he's
[40:54] forerunning the second coming of jesus
[40:56] christ
[40:58] someday in some day and someday in some
[41:01] day
[41:02] amen becoming the believers at ephesus
[41:06] preaching like apollos and brother said
[41:09] good people
[41:11] children of god disciples believers
[41:15] not antichrist not janice and jamborees
[41:19] amen the reason i know that is because
[41:21] i've been there
[41:23] i've been where apollos was i've been
[41:25] where these believers at ephesus was i
[41:27] had caught john the baptist coming i had
[41:29] caught
[41:29] amen malachi 4 i had caught elijah
[41:32] coming and i gave my whole
[41:34] life to it and believed it and
[41:35] surrendered everything repented from the
[41:37] denominational idea
[41:40] but i was looking someday someday
[41:44] someday until somebody come along
[41:49] and the holy spirit come along and
[41:50] whispered you got to look back
[41:54] he's already come he's here
[41:58] the son of man is here when brother ben
[42:00] said he injects himself as son of man
[42:02] we have to understand that injection a
[42:04] son of man
[42:05] is injected between son of god and
[42:08] between son of david
[42:10] so until he comes as son of david to
[42:13] set up his earthly kingdom in the
[42:14] millennial reign he
[42:16] must remain here as son of man
[42:19] even though the the the a son of man
[42:22] that was revealing the son of man was
[42:24] taken home
[42:25] amen the son of man did not leave when
[42:27] brother branham left
[42:30] because that son of man that come must
[42:32] remain
[42:33] present with us until we come to the son
[42:36] of david manifestation
[42:38] so now i'm going to ask you the question
[42:40] who do you say the son of man is
[42:45] you're like where where like i saw it in
[42:48] brother branham
[42:49] i saw it so clearly i understand the
[42:51] plains of memory i understand
[42:53] elohim and a body of flesh i saw it
[42:55] there there was a man
[42:56] he turned his back to the crowd that was
[42:58] it it was a son of man
[42:59] revealing the son of man i got it but
[43:02] that that manifestation that son of man
[43:05] he left
[43:06] and so now you're saying who is this son
[43:09] of man i'm not asking you who was that
[43:11] son of man in brother branham's day
[43:13] that's not my question today i'm not
[43:16] asking you who that was on the platform
[43:18] with you
[43:18] who it was to discern their thoughts and
[43:20] intent i'm asking you who this son of
[43:22] man
[43:22] is here today who do you say this is
[43:26] where is he and who do you say he is
[43:28] because he's got to be here
[43:31] he's got to be here and remain until we
[43:33] change dispensation of the son of david
[43:36] so where is he and who is he and who do
[43:38] you say he is
[43:41] praise god amen you know what's happened
[43:44] we've come right back to matthew 16
[43:45] again
[43:48] who do you who do you say the son of man
[43:51] is
[43:52] well some say this and some say that
[43:55] and it was malachi 4 and it was
[43:58] revelations 10
[43:59] 7 and that's a yeah
[44:02] yeah some say this and some say that
[44:06] the question is who do you say this is
[44:10] who do you say the son of man is
[44:18] further in the anointed ones at the end
[44:19] time
[44:21] he says the true vine and the false vine
[44:24] both had the same anointing
[44:29] holy ghost anointing
[44:34] the true vine and the false vine both
[44:36] had the same anointing the water fell on
[44:38] both of them
[44:39] no wonder he warned us it would deceive
[44:42] the very leg
[44:43] if it was possible notice they look the
[44:46] same
[44:46] they're anointed the same but notice by
[44:49] their fruit
[44:50] how do you know it now i want to lock
[44:53] down on this
[44:55] because the minute we start talking by
[44:57] their fruit how do you know
[44:58] you start thinking god in this
[45:00] gentleness peace long suffering
[45:02] temperance
[45:04] is that right by their fruits the fruit
[45:07] of the spirit the fruits of christ
[45:09] but brother brennan is not going to
[45:11] point to those fruits
[45:13] to notice the false vine he will not
[45:16] point to any of those fruits
[45:18] because the false vine have all those
[45:20] fruits
[45:23] so brother early in his ministry he used
[45:25] to say now
[45:27] the the the evidence of the holy ghost
[45:29] he knows it's not tongues but he doesn't
[45:30] know yet what it is to the evidence
[45:32] of the holy ghost it's got to be the
[45:34] fruits of the spirit
[45:35] yeah you get all those fruits of the
[45:36] spirit then he recognized no those can
[45:38] all be copied the false vine has the
[45:40] same fruits as the true vine
[45:43] that's why brother men will go in
[45:44] talking about you know your kind old
[45:46] priest you know he took care of you when
[45:48] you were sick he gave you money when you
[45:49] had when dad was out of work and
[45:51] he dedicated the babies he's been there
[45:52] all the time it means he's got character
[45:54] amen brother bannon even he
[45:56] he starts talking about makaya mikaya
[45:59] and
[45:59] zedekiah when they come before
[46:01] jehoshaphat and ahab
[46:02] and they asked mikaya mikaya
[46:06] is there anything wrong with zedekiah
[46:07] nope you ever seen him tell a lie
[46:09] no you ever see any problem no is his
[46:11] degree good
[46:12] yep is he a prophet of god
[46:15] yep is he a jewish prophet yes
[46:18] does he tell the truth yes
[46:23] is there anything wrong with his
[46:24] character nope
[46:26] can't put a light a finger on his life
[46:31] so you can't rely on those fruits
[46:36] well then you can go well the fruits
[46:37] let's go to manifestations you know we
[46:39] got speaking in tongues interpretation
[46:40] of tongues and
[46:41] laying on of hands and healing because
[46:43] because mark 16 said this will go with
[46:45] all the believers
[46:46] and it's absolutely the truth it should
[46:48] be present in the church of god
[46:50] there should be laying on of hands there
[46:51] should be tongues
[46:55] it should be in the church of the living
[46:57] god
[46:58] but the false vine can have all of the
[47:01] same manifestations
[47:04] so we can't look at that fruit
[47:08] so but by your fruit you'll know them
[47:10] well i can't look at manifestations
[47:12] and i can't look at fruits of the spirit
[47:14] or character
[47:16] or conduct or behavior what fruit can i
[47:19] look at to separate the true and false
[47:21] vine
[47:22] let's let the prophet of god tell us
[47:26] now you know that isn't an orange
[47:27] because it's bearing a grapefruit
[47:29] that vine is all right it's living in
[47:30] the tree but it's bearing a grapefruit
[47:32] it isn't like the first one
[47:34] and if the church says that they
[47:36] believed jesus christ the same yesterday
[47:37] today and forever
[47:38] and deny his power deny his works
[47:42] deny his word the church that believes
[47:44] in jesus christ
[47:45] will do the works of jesus christ it'll
[47:48] it'll have the life of jesus christ
[47:51] and if it isn't no matter if the life is
[47:53] pouring into it
[47:54] if it isn't predestinated from the roots
[47:56] it'll bear grapefruit every time
[47:58] or something different but if it if it's
[48:01] the predestinated life
[48:02] in the roots it'll bear jesus christ the
[48:05] same yesterday
[48:06] today and forever if it's the word
[48:08] coming up through the root
[48:11] which he is the root the beginning of
[48:13] time
[48:14] now i'm going to go on down and see what
[48:15] brother branham calls this fruit he
[48:17] makes it super clear but he says
[48:21] if it's predestinated life in the roots
[48:24] it'll bear
[48:24] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[48:27] and forever
[48:28] and i want to spend some time thinking
[48:29] about that jesus christ yesterday
[48:33] today and forever so we're going to take
[48:36] out jesus christ and spread him over the
[48:39] bible
[48:41] yesterday today and forever
[48:45] now how would you recognize true and
[48:49] false vine
[48:50] through the whole bible because the true
[48:52] vine is jesus christ the same yesterday
[48:55] today and forever
[48:58] you can't necessarily do it by conduct
[49:03] because david sinned with bathsheba and
[49:04] had riot killed
[49:06] you can't just do it by fruits because
[49:09] they were all manifesting the same fruit
[49:10] and some had bad fruit and good fruit
[49:12] and the righteous eats them had bad
[49:13] fruit and
[49:15] abimelech had no unrighteousness
[49:22] but what was the separating factor
[49:25] through the entire
[49:26] scriptures being able to receive
[49:30] the word for your day through the
[49:33] entire bible the separating from the
[49:36] true and false vine
[49:38] through the holy and it's jesus christ
[49:39] the same yesterday today and forever
[49:42] so it's got to be the same measuring
[49:44] stick the same
[49:45] separating principle that has to work
[49:47] through the whole scriptures
[49:48] it's got to work here at the end time
[49:50] the same as it did all the way back in
[49:52] the beginning
[49:52] and is separated by being able to
[49:54] receive the word of god for your day
[50:00] it's simple when we back up and look at
[50:02] it
[50:04] some people want to say well this means
[50:06] that and this means that
[50:08] amen but you know brother bem said it
[50:10] can all be replicated if it can be
[50:12] replicated amen if it can be
[50:13] if it can be copied amen then that's not
[50:16] it
[50:18] he says he goes on to say notice but
[50:21] it's what they produce that tells you
[50:23] the difference
[50:25] by their fruit jesus said you shall know
[50:27] them man does not gather grapes of a
[50:29] thistle
[50:30] even though a thistle may be right in
[50:31] the grapevine that that could be
[50:34] that could be possible but the fruit
[50:35] will tell it what
[50:37] is the fruit are you ready
[50:40] what is the fruit the word
[50:43] for the fruit for the season that's what
[50:46] it is
[50:47] their teaching the teaching of what the
[50:50] teaching of the season what time it is
[50:53] so what is their fruit their fruit is
[50:55] their teaching
[50:56] amen the teaching of the season is the
[51:00] is the true vine amen the teaching of
[51:02] the wrong season is the false vine
[51:06] it's the teaching of what the teaching
[51:07] of the season what time it is
[51:09] man's doctrine denominational doctrine
[51:11] or god's word for the season
[51:14] so the separating line brother brennan
[51:16] is bringing to us is the same
[51:18] separating line that we've had through
[51:19] the entire word of god
[51:21] amen it's the teaching being able to
[51:24] accept the word of god for our day
[51:26] amen and teach the word of god for our
[51:28] day the word in its season
[51:30] in that being taught is the fruit
[51:34] because they'll be the same kindness the
[51:36] same temperance
[51:38] amen the same brotherly love the same
[51:41] do you understand and the same healing
[51:45] and the same tongues and the same dreams
[51:52] that's why people in the past have
[51:53] gotten confused because they'll see an
[51:55] uptick in manifestations in the
[51:57] pentecostal church and prophecies and
[51:59] things like that
[52:00] in the in the church nominal the
[52:01] pentecostal church in this day
[52:03] and they get confused and don't get
[52:04] confused that's a genuine holy ghost on
[52:07] a genuine gift
[52:08] but brother banh says false vessel
[52:10] because of the teaching
[52:14] that the it goes to balaam and he says
[52:16] you know you go to balaam
[52:18] balaam amen it was brother says he goes
[52:21] over to jude i think in the book of
[52:23] revelation he said
[52:24] it was the teaching of balaam not the
[52:27] prophecy of balaam
[52:28] the prophecy of balaam was true the
[52:31] teaching of balaam was false
[52:36] so under the spirit and brother bam said
[52:38] he was a true
[52:39] prophet he was born that way he had the
[52:41] gift of a prophet
[52:42] amen and under that gift he had the
[52:45] brother bear said the
[52:46] same anointing that moses had
[52:51] and under the same anointing that moses
[52:53] had
[52:54] amen he catches the true prophecy
[52:57] and when he goes to curse israel because
[52:59] he's a genuine prophet
[53:01] with the genuine holy ghost he cannot
[53:03] under that anointing curse them
[53:05] all he can do is say you thou art a
[53:08] unicorn how lovely are thy tents and
[53:10] those that bless you will be blessed
[53:11] amen he pours out a blessing and a
[53:13] recognition of how god
[53:15] sees them remember balak had taken him
[53:18] up to the backside so he could see all
[53:20] the wickedness and the pollution in the
[53:21] dirt and the filth
[53:22] and the worst of the works that they had
[53:24] to offer and he looked at that
[53:26] he thought that'd be a suitable place to
[53:28] curse and when he goes to curse
[53:30] because he's got a true gift by the true
[53:31] spirit of god the same one moses had
[53:34] now what he starts doing is he starts
[53:36] speaking how
[53:37] god sees the backside of israel
[53:43] i don't care what the devil tells you i
[53:45] don't care what some
[53:47] false teacher has tried to tell you amen
[53:49] under a true anointing
[53:51] a false vessel under a true anointing
[53:53] can only say what god says
[53:54] and god didn't have anything evil to
[53:56] speak about that camp that day
[53:59] and there was evil there brother benham
[54:01] said
[54:03] just cause for cursing and all god could
[54:06] give us a blessing
[54:09] and balaam under the same anointing
[54:12] with the same gift brought forth a true
[54:15] prophecy
[54:15] and there was nothing wrong with this
[54:17] prophecy the problem was with his
[54:20] teaching
[54:23] his teaching that we're all the same
[54:26] that we can join in together in worship
[54:28] and fellowship
[54:31] it wasn't his prophecy it was his
[54:33] teaching
[54:35] it's not the tongues it's not the
[54:38] healings
[54:39] it's not the miracles it's not the
[54:41] dreams
[54:43] it's not the prophecies they're not
[54:44] wrong
[54:46] so when you see something happen in an
[54:48] uptick in the pentecostal root and you
[54:50] start seeing gifts and you're like
[54:51] look what they've got they've got what
[54:52] we don't have i dare say
[54:54] not don't you dare say something like
[54:58] that
[54:59] because we've got something they could
[55:00] never have we've got the word for this
[55:02] day and a faith in our heart to believe
[55:04] it
[55:04] and receive it amen and
[55:07] all of those gifts are present but
[55:09] they're under control
[55:14] why because god's highest form of
[55:17] communicating with man
[55:18] is the preaching of the word and if god
[55:20] can communicate through the preaching of
[55:21] the word
[55:22] he does not need to use every gift
[55:24] that's out there all the time
[55:25] because his highest form is the
[55:27] preaching of the word
[55:28] [Music]
[55:30] but every gift is present rest assured
[55:34] every gift is present
[55:37] amen just because you see this pop up in
[55:41] this
[55:42] what is it it's the latter rain
[55:45] they're under the latter rain brother
[55:48] member says the rain
[55:50] falls on the scripture the rain falls on
[55:52] the just and the unjust
[55:55] and brother brown said it's the former
[55:56] and latter rain the former rain was the
[55:58] teaching rain
[55:59] remember when it comes to the opening of
[56:00] the seals it was the latter rain or the
[56:02] harvest rain
[56:03] the rain that would fall to bring every
[56:06] seed into full maturity whether it's
[56:09] true or false where the tweet or thistle
[56:13] so what's happening they're under
[56:16] the latter rain and
[56:20] under the latter rain
[56:23] the gifts can operate
[56:26] don't let that confuse you that's not
[56:29] the
[56:30] fruit
[56:33] the gift is fine the teaching
[56:36] is false teaching trinitarianism
[56:40] teaching armenianism that every time you
[56:44] fail you got to come to the altar you
[56:45] got to start all over again you got to
[56:47] get re-baptized
[56:50] amen teaching that you know you can be
[56:54] lost
[56:56] when if you're a predestination of god
[56:57] you can't be lost
[57:00] so the the anointing is right the gift
[57:03] is right
[57:04] the manifestation is right but the
[57:06] teaching is wrong
[57:10] i hope that helps don't get confused by
[57:14] what we see i've had people tell me
[57:16] before the pentecostals are doing more
[57:18] than us
[57:19] no way
[57:22] no way what are you looking for are you
[57:25] looking for a manifestation are you
[57:26] looking for the word
[57:29] what are you focused on are you looking
[57:31] for the son of man
[57:32] who do you say the son of man thou art
[57:34] christ the son of the living god
[57:37] k ephesus was prophesying and didn't
[57:39] have that
[57:43] peter was running scared for his life
[57:45] but he had something k ephesus would
[57:46] never have
[57:50] i'd rather take peter's portion than k
[57:52] ephesus
[57:54] give me the word above everything else
[57:56] give me the word
[57:57] give me the word with the revelation the
[57:59] word for this hour above
[58:00] everything else that you can get give me
[58:02] that word
[58:05] because with the word comes everything
[58:09] the fullness every gift every
[58:11] manifestation every power
[58:12] in fact the revealed word is the power
[58:17] praise god let's get into matthew
[58:18] chapter 7.
[58:33] matthew chapter 7 verse 15.
[58:38] beware of false prophets which come to
[58:40] you in sheep's clothing but
[58:41] inwardly they are ravening wolves you
[58:44] shall know them by their fruits do men
[58:46] gather grapes of thorns or figs of
[58:48] thistles
[58:50] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[58:52] good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth
[58:54] forth
[58:55] evil fruit a good tree cannot bring
[58:58] forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
[58:59] tree bring forth good fruit
[59:01] every tree that bringeth forth not good
[59:04] not forth good fruit is shown down and
[59:05] cast into the fire
[59:07] wherefore by their fruit you shall know
[59:09] them
[59:10] now we know the difference between an
[59:13] evil fruit and a good fruit
[59:17] right because
[59:21] the evil fruit is the wrong
[59:25] teaching on the word the good fruit
[59:29] is the revelation of the hour
[59:33] that's what the prophet of god told us
[59:35] so now
[59:37] we don't have to be confused about
[59:39] scriptures like this
[59:42] it says not everyone that sayeth unto me
[59:44] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[59:45] of heaven
[59:46] but he that doeth the will of my father
[59:48] which is in heaven
[59:50] and his will is his word
[59:54] how do i know to do the will of god it's
[59:56] his word his will
[59:57] is his word he's given us his word this
[59:59] day he's given us his will
[1:00:00] and when we receive that in its full
[1:00:02] measure and live it with all that's in
[1:00:04] us amen we're doing the will of the
[1:00:06] father
[1:00:07] it's not him that saith lord lord that
[1:00:09] will enter in but he that doeth the will
[1:00:11] of my father
[1:00:12] and you cannot do the will without
[1:00:14] receiving the word
[1:00:19] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:00:21] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:00:24] and in thy name have we cast out devils
[1:00:26] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:00:28] works
[1:00:28] and then will i profess unto them i
[1:00:31] never
[1:00:32] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:00:35] iniquity the iniquity was not
[1:00:40] casting out devils the indiquity was not
[1:00:44] the miracles the signs and the wonders
[1:00:46] that was not the iniquity the iniquity
[1:00:48] was to know to
[1:00:49] do good and refuse to do it to not do
[1:00:52] the will of the father
[1:00:54] to not baptize in jesus name though you
[1:00:56] can see it in the scriptures
[1:00:58] to not dress in modest apparel though
[1:00:59] you can see in the scriptures and not
[1:01:01] teach the people to do that
[1:01:02] amen that is not doing the will of the
[1:01:05] father because you're not keeping the
[1:01:07] word
[1:01:07] amen you're teaching the wrong doctrine
[1:01:09] now you're found with iniquity no matter
[1:01:12] how many miracles healings and whatever
[1:01:14] has happened amen
[1:01:15] that's not the iniquity the iniquity is
[1:01:18] not
[1:01:18] keeping the word
[1:01:24] praise be to god that's why the brother
[1:01:26] bear said the bride will have the word
[1:01:27] and the word alone
[1:01:30] that doesn't mean there won't be
[1:01:31] manifestations with it but that's not
[1:01:32] her security
[1:01:33] my security is not in the things that
[1:01:36] made
[1:01:37] judas feel secure
[1:01:43] judas comes back with the the disciples
[1:01:46] who went out two by two
[1:01:47] and they start declaring oh i mean we
[1:01:50] healed the sick and i mean we did many
[1:01:52] many things and the devils were subject
[1:01:54] into us
[1:01:57] he said don't rejoice in that the devils
[1:01:58] are subject unto you
[1:02:01] rejoice that your names are written in
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:04] heaven
[1:02:08] i don't my security i don't want my
[1:02:11] security to be the same thing that made
[1:02:13] caiaphas feel secure
[1:02:16] or made judas feel secure or any of
[1:02:19] these people
[1:02:20] in matthew chapter 7 that come and said
[1:02:23] lord lord
[1:02:25] you realize this group
[1:02:29] when they called him lord lord they knew
[1:02:31] who he was
[1:02:33] this is a familiar term of lord lord
[1:02:35] with emphasis upon it
[1:02:37] and they say lord and i've mentioned
[1:02:40] this many many many times but i'm going
[1:02:42] to reinforce it here
[1:02:45] they're standing at the white throne
[1:02:46] judgment
[1:02:49] they are not lying to god
[1:02:53] they are not trying to pull the wool
[1:02:55] over his eyes
[1:02:57] they are being honest
[1:03:00] when he says when we have are we not
[1:03:03] prophesied in thy name they did it
[1:03:05] we're not cast out devils in thy name
[1:03:07] they did it and done many wonderful
[1:03:09] works
[1:03:09] they did it and apparently if they can
[1:03:13] stand at the white throne judgment and
[1:03:15] make
[1:03:16] that their defense they have a false
[1:03:19] sense of security that the fact they
[1:03:21] could prophesy
[1:03:22] cast out devils and do many mighty works
[1:03:24] would make them
[1:03:25] fit to enter into the kingdom of heaven
[1:03:27] and but god saw them
[1:03:29] unfit although the works were fine
[1:03:32] amen the iniquity was not keeping the
[1:03:34] word
[1:03:38] brother branham said you minister sit in
[1:03:39] your study and you read that faith and
[1:03:41] you turn the page quick to not have to
[1:03:43] deal with it
[1:03:45] that's this group right here
[1:03:50] so let our security be in the revelation
[1:03:53] of the word
[1:03:59] our security
[1:04:03] is so rich
[1:04:06] because it's a divine revelation it's
[1:04:09] not a put on it's not a pretend
[1:04:11] you can't make yourself not believe it's
[1:04:14] not a trying or straining i'm working my
[1:04:17] way to
[1:04:17] i just believe it it's a
[1:04:21] it's something that god has done in my
[1:04:22] heart something that was given to me
[1:04:24] it's not something i worked up to read
[1:04:26] enough labored enough
[1:04:28] i just receive it as it is i believe
[1:04:31] this gospel
[1:04:36] and abel was so secure in his revelation
[1:04:40] that he didn't fight back when cain
[1:04:41] fought him
[1:04:45] and he was willing to lay down his life
[1:04:47] no greater
[1:04:48] love has any man than to lay down his
[1:04:51] life for a friend
[1:04:53] and abel surrendered himself under the
[1:04:56] revelation of the world
[1:04:58] word and he didn't fight back against
[1:05:01] king
[1:05:04] that's real security in your revelation
[1:05:08] but when you've got to lash out and
[1:05:10] strike out and fight and prove you're
[1:05:12] right
[1:05:14] where's the security at where's our
[1:05:17] confidence in the word that we believe
[1:05:20] why not just say i don't know i just
[1:05:22] believe it
[1:05:26] you don't see it that's okay i mean
[1:05:28] that's
[1:05:29] fine with me i'm not upset
[1:05:32] i don't think abel was angry at kane
[1:05:35] because cain couldn't see what abel was
[1:05:36] telling him
[1:05:38] i don't think that's the nature that he
[1:05:40] had
[1:05:41] he may have felt sorry he may have been
[1:05:43] grieved but i don't think he was angry
[1:05:46] but somehow it made cain angry to have a
[1:05:48] difference
[1:05:52] the difference in revelation the
[1:05:54] difference in understanding
[1:05:56] made cain angry but i don't think it
[1:05:59] made abel angry
[1:06:01] and abel was able abel was able
[1:06:06] abel was able to not fight back
[1:06:11] i want to get to that place where i'm so
[1:06:12] secure in christ
[1:06:15] like the apostle paul if they throw
[1:06:16] rocks at your head they throw rocks at
[1:06:18] your head
[1:06:19] what could he do about it they beat you
[1:06:20] on the back they beat you in the back
[1:06:22] what did he do he was so secure he was
[1:06:24] so confident that what he had was the
[1:06:25] word of god
[1:06:26] when they left him for dead outside the
[1:06:28] city the disciples gathered around and
[1:06:29] he come back to life
[1:06:30] and you find him in the next city
[1:06:32] preaching again
[1:06:34] that's a man who's thoroughly convinced
[1:06:36] that what he's got is the goods
[1:06:40] and what he had he was so convinced in
[1:06:43] what he had
[1:06:44] that when god allowed the circumstances
[1:06:46] to turn negative and evil and he was
[1:06:48] beaten for what he said
[1:06:49] he didn't throw away what he what he
[1:06:52] taught
[1:06:55] you understand he was confident that
[1:06:58] this was jesus christ
[1:07:00] that this was the word he'd go right
[1:07:02] back and teach it again he'd go right
[1:07:04] back and say it over
[1:07:05] he'd go right back and preach the same
[1:07:06] sermon he got stoned for he preached it
[1:07:08] again
[1:07:10] why because he knew it was the truth
[1:07:13] that's a man who was confident he wasn't
[1:07:16] willing
[1:07:17] under the first sign of pressure to run
[1:07:19] away
[1:07:21] like marcus did in their first journey
[1:07:25] marcus hightailed at home he eventually
[1:07:28] repented they were restored
[1:07:29] but at the first when that pressure come
[1:07:31] he hightailed at home paul
[1:07:32] had nowhere else to go he was standing
[1:07:34] on the word he had the word he had a
[1:07:35] commission
[1:07:36] he had nothing else he was so convinced
[1:07:38] he was willing to give his life for it
[1:07:42] i want to be that kind of confident
[1:07:44] these people in matthew chapter 7
[1:07:47] standing before almighty god
[1:07:50] at the white throne judgment have a
[1:07:53] false sense of security and have staked
[1:07:56] their salvation on the wrong thing
[1:08:02] they have put their salvation their
[1:08:05] defense at the white throne judgment
[1:08:07] they have based it
[1:08:09] on their works and their manifestations
[1:08:11] of the spirit
[1:08:13] and i want to say true manifestations of
[1:08:16] the true spirit
[1:08:24] i wonder
[1:08:28] i wonder if we could
[1:08:32] stand at the white throne judgment
[1:08:36] and you yourself be there who really
[1:08:39] lived a simple basic christian life
[1:08:43] really there wasn't a lot of hoopla
[1:08:46] about your life there wasn't
[1:08:47] tons of supernatural you had some
[1:08:49] supernatural things that happened you
[1:08:50] had
[1:08:51] god do some special things in your life
[1:08:53] but really you never had a public
[1:08:55] display of that
[1:08:56] it was really private in your life
[1:08:58] private in your home and
[1:08:59] and you had god show up on the scene you
[1:09:02] had manifestations of gifts in your life
[1:09:03] but
[1:09:04] really it was never public it was never
[1:09:06] broadcast
[1:09:07] many people didn't know and you sit
[1:09:10] there
[1:09:11] and your confidence was never in the
[1:09:13] fact that god answered your prayer
[1:09:16] because if your confidence is in the
[1:09:18] fact that god answered your prayer when
[1:09:19] he decides not to answer your prayer
[1:09:20] where did your confidence go
[1:09:25] and if your confidence is in the fact
[1:09:27] that you lay hands on somebody and
[1:09:28] they're healed what happens if they lay
[1:09:29] hands on somebody and they die
[1:09:33] where did your confidence go but can you
[1:09:35] imagine sitting there you're the bride
[1:09:37] you're not in the white throne gender
[1:09:38] you're just sitting there
[1:09:39] you're you're on the throne with christ
[1:09:43] you didn't have a flashy life you didn't
[1:09:45] have a lot of things you could point to
[1:09:47] and one by one these great men of the
[1:09:49] age come
[1:09:50] the pentecostal age raising the dead and
[1:09:54] healing the sick and
[1:09:57] and one by one they're refused and
[1:09:59] banished out of darkness
[1:10:02] what was the separating line
[1:10:05] what was the dividing line
[1:10:09] it was you were able by the grace of god
[1:10:11] to receive the word for your day
[1:10:14] you were able to receive the son of man
[1:10:16] you were able to accept that this is
[1:10:18] jesus christ the son of the living god
[1:10:20] and something in your heart cried out
[1:10:21] when others would say it's bogus or it's
[1:10:24] a charlatan or
[1:10:25] it's a false prophet something in your
[1:10:26] heart said it's none other than
[1:10:28] jesus christ the son of god
[1:10:34] brother ben says again an anointed ones
[1:10:36] at the end time
[1:10:37] he said oh america how of god would have
[1:10:39] hovered you but now your hours come you
[1:10:42] lead the world in filth blasphemers
[1:10:44] disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
[1:10:46] without natural affections
[1:10:49] no true love even for one another man to
[1:10:51] woman woman to man not even natural
[1:10:52] affection filthy sexually
[1:10:55] truth fakers false accusers incontinent
[1:10:57] fierce and despises those that are good
[1:11:00] in other words say you bunch of holy
[1:11:01] rollers someone asked the other day
[1:11:03] about
[1:11:03] coming up here to the church said don't
[1:11:05] go up there all it is is a bunch of
[1:11:07] noise and carrying on
[1:11:09] see despisers of those traitors heady
[1:11:12] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:11:13] lovers of god
[1:11:14] you say brother brenham that's communist
[1:11:16] what's the next verse say
[1:11:18] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:11:21] the power
[1:11:22] thereof now brother
[1:11:26] injects a statement in here in parent
[1:11:28] they put it in parentheses
[1:11:30] so i'm going to finish this sentence and
[1:11:32] i'm going to show you what he emphasized
[1:11:34] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:11:36] the power thereof the word
[1:11:40] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:11:42] the power thereof what's the power of
[1:11:44] that it's the word
[1:11:46] you have a form of godliness
[1:11:48] god-likeness amen but when you reject
[1:11:50] the word you reject god amen you reject
[1:11:52] the power of godliness
[1:11:54] because the power of godliness is based
[1:11:56] on the revelation of the word
[1:11:58] because the word was with god the word
[1:12:00] was god amen brother brahma said the god
[1:12:02] is the word
[1:12:06] having a form of guidance but denying
[1:12:07] the power thereof the word jesus christ
[1:12:10] the same yesterday
[1:12:11] today and forever manifested the promise
[1:12:14] for the day just exactly like han and i
[1:12:18] just exactly like zedeki just exactly
[1:12:20] like balaam
[1:12:21] on back other false prophets having a
[1:12:23] form of godliness anointed see
[1:12:25] having reform anointed and ordained
[1:12:27] ministers having a form of godliness
[1:12:29] but denying that he's the same yesterday
[1:12:32] today
[1:12:32] denying his word
[1:12:37] so if you deny the power thereof having
[1:12:40] a form regardless but denying the power
[1:12:42] thereof
[1:12:44] the pentecostals will teach that you're
[1:12:45] denying the manifestation of the gifts
[1:12:49] that's not what brother benham said when
[1:12:52] you deny the power thereof you're
[1:12:53] denying jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:12:55] today and forever
[1:12:56] the word made manifest in your day
[1:12:58] that's the power thereof
[1:13:05] denying that he's the same yesterday
[1:13:07] today
[1:13:09] denying his word how did they deny jesus
[1:13:12] in that day
[1:13:13] who did they deny when they denied jesus
[1:13:15] the word
[1:13:16] who were they denying the word when they
[1:13:19] denied him they denied god
[1:13:21] they were religious they taught from
[1:13:23] their bible but denied the present day
[1:13:25] word
[1:13:27] amen they were religious they were bible
[1:13:30] scholars
[1:13:32] they were bible teachers they were
[1:13:34] religious they were teaching
[1:13:36] out of the bible the same bible jesus
[1:13:39] was quoting from was the same one they
[1:13:41] were reading from
[1:13:43] and jesus was quoting scriptures to show
[1:13:45] who he was and they were quoting
[1:13:47] scriptures to deny who he was
[1:13:50] come out of the same bible
[1:13:55] they taught from their bible but denied
[1:13:57] the present day word
[1:13:59] what are they today same thing anointed
[1:14:01] preaching the gospel of pentecost but
[1:14:03] denying the present day promise
[1:14:05] of the word being vindicated jesus
[1:14:08] christ the same
[1:14:09] yesterday today and forever do you see
[1:14:12] it
[1:14:15] the man was going to say moses said now
[1:14:17] the lord god will speak to me and show
[1:14:19] me
[1:14:19] and has told me what to do and i'll tell
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:23] said i am sent me god told him to say
[1:14:26] i who should i say send me they're going
[1:14:29] to ask me your name that i met you that
[1:14:30] you have a name
[1:14:31] what's your name say tell them i am sent
[1:14:33] you
[1:14:35] because if you want to know god you have
[1:14:37] to know him as the i
[1:14:38] am you cannot know
[1:14:42] god as the i was or that i will be but
[1:14:45] the only way to know god today is to
[1:14:47] know him as the i
[1:14:48] am
[1:14:51] i am sent me i am not i was or will be i
[1:14:55] am present tense the word now not the
[1:14:58] word that was or the word that will come
[1:15:00] the word that's now
[1:15:01] you get it i am i am is the word in the
[1:15:04] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:15:06] with god is that right
[1:15:08] i am i want god
[1:15:11] if you want god you contact him as the i
[1:15:14] am the word made manifest
[1:15:19] it says there is one genuine christ
[1:15:22] spirit there is one genuine christ
[1:15:26] remember we're talking about jesus
[1:15:27] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:15:28] forever
[1:15:29] there is one genuine christ spirit
[1:15:32] that's the word made flesh
[1:15:34] as he promised to do it think on that
[1:15:39] there's one genuine christ spirit that's
[1:15:41] the word made flesh
[1:15:43] but he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:46] forever
[1:15:47] so brother brennan's not talking about
[1:15:49] 33 years
[1:15:51] that was 2000 years ago he's talking
[1:15:54] about the word made
[1:15:55] flesh what's that
[1:15:58] that's the genuine christ spirit
[1:16:02] let's go to hebrews 11.
[1:16:16] hebrews 11 and 24.
[1:16:25] by faith moses when he was come to years
[1:16:27] refused to be called the son of
[1:16:29] refuse to be called the son of pharaoh's
[1:16:32] daughter
[1:16:32] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[1:16:34] with the people of god to enjoy the
[1:16:36] pleasure of sin
[1:16:37] for a season esteeming the reproach of
[1:16:42] christ you tell me christ was all the
[1:16:46] way back in the book of genesis
[1:16:52] moses made a choice and his choice was
[1:16:56] to bear the reproach of christ
[1:16:57] because it's jesus christ is saying
[1:16:59] yesterday today
[1:17:01] and forever the same jesus christ we're
[1:17:04] accepting today
[1:17:05] is the same jesus christ moses was
[1:17:07] accepting and bearing his reproach
[1:17:10] it is the word the word the word
[1:17:13] the word
[1:17:18] he says back in anointing once at the
[1:17:20] end time
[1:17:23] it's the grain of wheat itself the son
[1:17:25] of man will be made manifest
[1:17:26] the grain of wheat will come back to
[1:17:28] itself again the
[1:17:30] son of man in the last day
[1:17:34] he says the reason the elected jesus
[1:17:36] said won't be deceived
[1:17:38] because they are that word i'm going to
[1:17:41] put these two things together
[1:17:43] let's go back and read it it's the grain
[1:17:46] of wheat
[1:17:47] itself the son of man will be made
[1:17:50] manifest the grain of wheat will come
[1:17:52] back to itself
[1:17:53] again the son of man in the last days
[1:17:58] so we're coming back to the son of man
[1:18:00] again in the last days
[1:18:01] the grain of wheat is coming back to
[1:18:03] itself in the last days
[1:18:05] and then he says the reason the elect
[1:18:08] the elected jesus said won't be deceived
[1:18:11] because they are that word
[1:18:15] they can't be nothing else they can't
[1:18:17] hear nothing else
[1:18:18] they don't know nothing else that's
[1:18:20] right
[1:18:22] so what word are they if they are the
[1:18:25] word if the bridegroom was a word what
[1:18:27] will the bride be
[1:18:28] the word if eve amen if the woman was
[1:18:32] actually taken out of the man and god
[1:18:35] looked down at man and woman and called
[1:18:36] her adam
[1:18:37] she was adam and you understand that i
[1:18:40] mean she was
[1:18:40] adam she was the same thing whatever
[1:18:43] adam was she was whatever adam was made
[1:18:45] out of she was made out of
[1:18:46] whatever spirit was in her was the
[1:18:48] spirit that was in adam
[1:18:52] so she was him
[1:18:57] one the woman before she got her name
[1:18:59] eve because eve is the name of blasphemy
[1:19:02] it's a name of adultery so she got her
[1:19:06] name after she fell
[1:19:07] not before so as the woman woman is
[1:19:10] title woman isn't name
[1:19:13] she had a name she had a god-given name
[1:19:16] and her name was adam
[1:19:19] because she was him
[1:19:24] they were two of the same thing male and
[1:19:27] female
[1:19:28] of the same thing the same substance the
[1:19:30] same spirit the same life
[1:19:36] so now if he's coming back to grain
[1:19:39] again
[1:19:41] he's coming back to itself the grain
[1:19:44] again
[1:19:45] that's the word and
[1:19:48] she's coming to her position which is
[1:19:52] the word and the and christ coming back
[1:19:56] as the son of man is the word for our
[1:19:59] day
[1:20:01] the bride coming her position is the
[1:20:03] word for our day
[1:20:06] are you getting it not two words for our
[1:20:09] day
[1:20:10] one word for our day not two
[1:20:13] manifestations in our day
[1:20:15] one manifestation in our day
[1:20:19] when he comes back to the grain
[1:20:22] and she becomes the word
[1:20:26] then you're uniting signs and times she
[1:20:28] is the word
[1:20:29] she is the grain
[1:20:34] that's why brother bram said see tussle
[1:20:37] i mean blade
[1:20:38] tossled shut grain blade tossled shut
[1:20:41] gray
[1:20:41] he teaches it over and over and over
[1:20:42] again now he tells us jesus the son of
[1:20:44] man is coming back to grain back to
[1:20:46] itself again
[1:20:47] how will it come back to itself again
[1:20:49] he's been coming back through the church
[1:20:51] ages
[1:20:52] and finally he comes back to the grain
[1:20:54] the original word
[1:20:55] there's can i find faith when the son of
[1:20:57] man comes will he find faith
[1:20:58] what faith the original faith in the
[1:21:00] original word back to grain again
[1:21:07] when the flesh becomes the word and the
[1:21:09] word is becoming flesh
[1:21:15] see the elected jesus said won't be to
[1:21:17] see because they are that word
[1:21:20] let's look at john 12. the gospel of
[1:21:23] john
[1:21:24] chapter 12.
[1:21:32] remember my question and don't forget it
[1:21:36] who do you say this son of man is
[1:21:41] not that son of man i think the
[1:21:44] dispensation previous to us in the
[1:21:46] forerunner
[1:21:47] is clear but i'm asking today
[1:21:52] who do you say this son of man is
[1:21:54] because there has to be a ministry the
[1:21:56] son of man on earth
[1:22:00] john chapter 12 verse 21
[1:22:06] the same came therefore to philip which
[1:22:08] was
[1:22:09] the theta sorry of galilean desired him
[1:22:13] saying
[1:22:13] sir we would see jesus philip cometh and
[1:22:16] telleth
[1:22:17] andrew and again andrew and philip tell
[1:22:19] jesus
[1:22:20] and jesus answered them saying now i
[1:22:22] want you to focus on the question
[1:22:25] the greeks which are gentiles not jews
[1:22:27] gentiles
[1:22:28] they're coming and they're asking a
[1:22:29] question and they're saying we want to
[1:22:30] see jesus
[1:22:32] so now you got to you got to know the
[1:22:34] question and who's
[1:22:35] asking the question to make sense of the
[1:22:38] response
[1:22:41] and jesus answered them and saying the
[1:22:42] hours come that the son of man should be
[1:22:44] glorified
[1:22:45] verily verily i say unto you except a
[1:22:48] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[1:22:50] die and abideth alone but if it die
[1:22:52] it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:22:56] what did he just do he just answered
[1:22:59] their question
[1:23:02] you're gentiles this isn't the form i
[1:23:05] come to the gentiles in
[1:23:07] they say we would see jesus it wasn't
[1:23:09] time when it was now time for the
[1:23:11] gentiles to come seeking jesus he says
[1:23:13] well it's time for the son of man to be
[1:23:14] glorified i got to get off the scene
[1:23:16] because the gentiles are looking for me
[1:23:17] and they will not find me
[1:23:19] in this manifestation
[1:23:23] it's time for me to go but tell them
[1:23:28] if a corner wheat fall into a ground and
[1:23:30] die unless it for the fallen ground and
[1:23:32] die of bite of the alone but if it die
[1:23:34] amen it'll come forth what will it come
[1:23:37] forth
[1:23:38] one will come forth many the bridegroom
[1:23:40] will come down and come
[1:23:42] up the bride it'll go down one's grain
[1:23:45] of wheat
[1:23:45] it'll come back and ahead a multiple
[1:23:48] grains of wheat
[1:23:51] so how will the greek see jesus not as
[1:23:54] the singular grain
[1:23:55] but in the head when it comes back to a
[1:23:58] body
[1:23:59] a bride body of jesus christ that's when
[1:24:02] the greeks will see him
[1:24:07] we would see jesus uh-oh it's time for
[1:24:10] the son of man to be glorified
[1:24:13] i'm not going to show myself in this
[1:24:16] form to the greeks
[1:24:19] but if i don't go in the ground and die
[1:24:23] i'll buy it alone but if i go into the
[1:24:26] ground and die
[1:24:28] we'll bring forth much fruit
[1:24:31] if you want to see me look for the grain
[1:24:34] again
[1:24:37] who do you say the son of man is
[1:24:42] and the message the unveiling of god
[1:24:46] brother says now to the perfect after
[1:24:49] the stalk has been formed
[1:24:51] after the toss has been formed after the
[1:24:53] grain has come into the cob
[1:24:54] then it has to come to perfection back
[1:24:56] to the regular grain again
[1:24:58] you notice he's talking about the church
[1:25:00] ages
[1:25:01] he's referring to church ages and he's
[1:25:03] talking about jesus coming back to the
[1:25:05] grain
[1:25:07] but he's talking about the church ages
[1:25:10] so i hope you can see
[1:25:11] it's the same thing
[1:25:15] remember the grain must be germatized if
[1:25:17] it don't it won't live
[1:25:18] none of that was outside of the
[1:25:19] messengers will ever come to life
[1:25:21] it has to be germanized to it but
[1:25:23] remember the same life that was in the
[1:25:24] stalk is in the grain
[1:25:26] it's just maturing itself right back see
[1:25:28] he revealed himself what son of man
[1:25:31] the grain that went into the ground get
[1:25:33] the message
[1:25:35] brother did you get it he
[1:25:39] he the it's been the same life through
[1:25:42] the stalk through the torso through the
[1:25:44] stalk
[1:25:44] and remember it's coming back to
[1:25:45] maturity back to grain again back to the
[1:25:48] same grain that went in the ground
[1:25:51] it's just maturing itself right back see
[1:25:53] he revealed himself what the son of man
[1:25:56] the grain that went into the ground so
[1:25:58] when he reveals himself as son of man
[1:25:59] again it'll be grain time
[1:26:01] harvest time maturity time
[1:26:06] the greek said to him we would see jesus
[1:26:09] he said except the corner except the
[1:26:11] corn falls into the ground see
[1:26:12] all right now what did he reveal himself
[1:26:15] next
[1:26:16] in a different form stalk
[1:26:19] and tossle and so forth i'm not just
[1:26:21] making this up friends
[1:26:23] brother branham is telling us what those
[1:26:25] church ages were
[1:26:26] it was building back a body for jesus
[1:26:29] christ
[1:26:32] he revealed himself then same spirit but
[1:26:34] in a different form
[1:26:36] but that's the lat but what's the last
[1:26:38] of the corn
[1:26:39] it comes back to the grain again is that
[1:26:42] right
[1:26:43] and his ministry comes from them
[1:26:46] reformations back to the original word
[1:26:48] again
[1:26:48] the word comes to a prophet and he
[1:26:50] promised in malachi 4 and to restore the
[1:26:53] faith of the people back
[1:26:54] to the original grain what went in the
[1:26:57] ground
[1:26:58] is hear the same do you catch that
[1:27:01] amen jesus said unless a corner of wheat
[1:27:03] fallen to the ground
[1:27:05] he went to the ground and died he said
[1:27:07] what was back there
[1:27:09] is here the same
[1:27:12] the grain has come up through here it
[1:27:14] come up as a son of god
[1:27:16] when he says it come up as the son of
[1:27:17] god he's talking about the seven church
[1:27:19] ages
[1:27:21] it was son of man son of god through the
[1:27:23] church ages
[1:27:24] back to this little sliver of son of man
[1:27:26] before son of david sets up his earthly
[1:27:28] kingdom in the millennium
[1:27:30] so now he's talking about this is grain
[1:27:32] here but this grain's got to go into the
[1:27:34] ground and die
[1:27:34] through the church age it's got to be
[1:27:36] restored back but it's got to come back
[1:27:38] to grain again
[1:27:39] when it's grain again it's the same
[1:27:40] thing that went down
[1:27:44] son of man son of man went down
[1:27:47] it was the son of god through the
[1:27:48] restoration process the building of the
[1:27:50] body but when it's capped off at son of
[1:27:52] man again
[1:27:55] who do you say the son of man is
[1:27:59] see he says
[1:28:03] back to the original grain what went in
[1:28:05] the ground is here the same
[1:28:07] the grain has come up through here it
[1:28:09] come up as a son of god
[1:28:10] now now it reveals itself
[1:28:14] here as son of man and then it reveals
[1:28:16] itself as son of david on the throne
[1:28:19] see them three sons just exactly oh my
[1:28:22] again like the original
[1:28:23] not to the to the perfect ministry of
[1:28:26] himself
[1:28:27] not some man not some denomination as
[1:28:29] they've
[1:28:30] worked down through the age there but
[1:28:32] himself made manifest
[1:28:34] manifest himself to the promise making
[1:28:37] saint luke 17 28 malachi 4 and so forth
[1:28:40] hebrews 13
[1:28:41] 8 just exactly right at that time what
[1:28:44] time should it be
[1:28:45] when the royal seed of abraham is
[1:28:47] looking for the promised son
[1:28:49] and all types must be fulfilled and god
[1:28:52] himself appeared in the form of a human
[1:28:54] being
[1:28:54] to abraham's natural seed before the
[1:28:56] destruction and jesus said it would be
[1:28:58] the same thing to the royal seed
[1:29:00] before the promised son returns we've
[1:29:03] come right through that cycle
[1:29:05] we've had three angels that come amen
[1:29:07] we've had two that goes down into sodom
[1:29:09] brother of them said oral roberts and
[1:29:10] billy graham but one stayed up here with
[1:29:12] this elected called out group
[1:29:14] and what was that it was god working in
[1:29:17] a body of flesh
[1:29:18] brotherhood said it's not me who does
[1:29:20] this he said i can't tell you what's
[1:29:21] wrong with you it's not me
[1:29:22] it's god
[1:29:28] then we come to the invisible union of
[1:29:30] the bride of christ
[1:29:32] he says but remember when it went down
[1:29:34] and the grain began to ripen you find
[1:29:36] before that grain can ripen
[1:29:39] everything in that stalk has to be dead
[1:29:42] so for the grain to ripen
[1:29:43] the church ages have to die
[1:29:47] all of them have to die so the life
[1:29:49] moves into the grain
[1:29:54] hallelujah can't you see where we're
[1:29:56] standing
[1:29:59] if everything in that stalk has to die
[1:30:01] and the shuck
[1:30:04] then can't you see where we're standing
[1:30:06] we're standing past the shock
[1:30:08] back in the grain that's the only place
[1:30:10] the life can be
[1:30:12] what is it just exactly like the same
[1:30:14] grain that went in the ground
[1:30:16] the same jesus in bride form
[1:30:24] what have we been talking about what
[1:30:25] went in the ground the grain
[1:30:28] what's coming back at the end of the
[1:30:30] ages the grain when the greeks looked
[1:30:34] for him
[1:30:35] he was singular but he couldn't show
[1:30:37] himself to the greeks that way
[1:30:38] he says unless a corner we fall into the
[1:30:40] ground i abide alone but if it falls on
[1:30:42] the ground diet brings forth much fruit
[1:30:44] when after he's done with the son of god
[1:30:46] dispensation
[1:30:47] amen and all the life leaves that all
[1:30:50] the life moves into the grain
[1:30:51] which is the bride amen the same life
[1:30:55] that went down
[1:30:56] comes back up again the same everything
[1:30:59] the same
[1:31:00] he's this is what he says the same jesus
[1:31:03] in bride form
[1:31:06] why did they miss him when he come to
[1:31:08] the jews because he came in an
[1:31:09] unexpected way to their theology
[1:31:12] why did they miss him in this day
[1:31:14] because he came in an unexpected way to
[1:31:16] their theology
[1:31:21] but it is now back to the grain it is
[1:31:24] now
[1:31:24] harvest time it is the
[1:31:28] it is the the former rain has come the
[1:31:31] latter rain has come
[1:31:32] the harvest is on he's cleaning and
[1:31:34] pulling out his harvest
[1:31:38] because it's back to the grain again
[1:31:41] that's what harvest is that's what
[1:31:43] adoption age is that's what bride age is
[1:31:45] it's all the same thing it's the harvest
[1:31:48] of the wheat
[1:31:53] i want to read that again life
[1:31:56] is in the grain again brother branham is
[1:31:59] not saying it will be
[1:32:01] the life is in the grain again which
[1:32:04] means it is
[1:32:05] not in any previous dispensation
[1:32:10] and it was proved by god taking a wave
[1:32:12] sheep and
[1:32:13] plucking up a piece of this field which
[1:32:16] is bright age field
[1:32:18] which is church field amen pulled it up
[1:32:21] out of the bride and he waved it before
[1:32:23] the people it was the first part of the
[1:32:25] word to come to harvest maturity
[1:32:29] it wasn't the man it was the word that
[1:32:32] was inside the man
[1:32:35] had come to maturity to display jesus
[1:32:38] christ
[1:32:39] back in flesh again and it was waved
[1:32:41] over the people
[1:32:42] showing the whole harvest that the whole
[1:32:46] field that we are at harvest time now
[1:32:49] the life is in the grain
[1:32:50] amen and whatever happened to that is
[1:32:52] happening to me
[1:32:57] not another age not another dispensation
[1:32:59] not another time
[1:33:00] but the time is on that's what the wave
[1:33:02] sheath marks the time is on
[1:33:05] this is harvest time now we know where
[1:33:07] the life is it's in the grain
[1:33:10] what is the grain it's jesus
[1:33:13] in bride form
[1:33:16] i love the fact that he didn't say
[1:33:18] christ
[1:33:21] because if he had said christ people
[1:33:23] would take this quote and they'd shove
[1:33:24] it into a different category
[1:33:27] and they'd make it a son of god text
[1:33:32] but this is the son of man text
[1:33:36] jesus same jesus
[1:33:40] in the bright form same power
[1:33:43] same church same thing same word
[1:33:47] the same word sucked up through these
[1:33:48] and come out here and come to a head
[1:33:50] here
[1:33:51] and all that life that come through here
[1:33:53] picked up its people
[1:33:54] now it's forming up into a head for the
[1:33:56] rapture
[1:34:00] it's the same jesus in bright form
[1:34:07] who do you say the son of man is
[1:34:12] well you know it's the spirit of god
[1:34:16] it's a spiritual manner brother graham
[1:34:19] said it's jesus and bride form
[1:34:23] and it can't be accepted because he
[1:34:25] comes in an unexpected way
[1:34:27] to our theology
[1:34:31] oh if there's any believers in ephesus
[1:34:35] listen to me today it's jesus
[1:34:39] in brideform it's the coming of the son
[1:34:43] of man
[1:34:43] came at the revealing of the son of man
[1:34:46] those events happen together
[1:34:48] amen this is grain time this is harvest
[1:34:50] time we're not looking for the harvest
[1:34:52] we're
[1:34:52] in the harvest we're not looking for the
[1:34:54] rapture this is the rapture the rapture
[1:34:56] is ongoing now
[1:34:58] gathering all the wheat together and
[1:35:00] when he gets it all together amen he's
[1:35:02] going to carry it away
[1:35:06] this is the harvest this is the rapture
[1:35:08] this is the grain
[1:35:10] this is the son of man this is
[1:35:14] christ jesus in bright form
[1:35:18] back in the anointed ones at the end
[1:35:20] time he says the anointed ones
[1:35:22] jesus said they're teaching for doctrine
[1:35:23] the interpretation of the scriptures of
[1:35:25] man
[1:35:27] see not the word of god not his
[1:35:29] vindicated word
[1:35:30] teaching a historical christ
[1:35:33] see something that was
[1:35:38] when moses introduced god to them he had
[1:35:41] to
[1:35:42] introduce him as i am
[1:35:47] it's got to be i am teaching a
[1:35:50] historical christ something that was
[1:35:53] and the bible said he is i am not i was
[1:35:55] or will be i am right now
[1:35:57] he's the word that lives through there
[1:35:59] he was in the beginning
[1:36:00] he was in the blades he was in the
[1:36:02] tassel he was in the shock
[1:36:04] but now he's in the grain
[1:36:08] no questions anointing ones at the end
[1:36:10] time again he says
[1:36:12] in the very day that the son of man is
[1:36:14] revealed revelation 10 1-7
[1:36:17] okay that's when he's revealed the
[1:36:20] opening of the seals
[1:36:22] revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get
[1:36:25] home the seventh angel's message
[1:36:26] open up those seals what is it not the
[1:36:29] angel is the son of man
[1:36:31] but the messenger is revealing the son
[1:36:33] of man can you get it separated now
[1:36:35] that's where it seemed to be so hard for
[1:36:38] you see not the son of man himself
[1:36:40] but the seventh angel the seventh
[1:36:42] messenger is revealing to the public
[1:36:44] the son of man because it's left to
[1:36:47] shock
[1:36:48] it can't organize it's the grain itself
[1:36:51] again he has already come
[1:36:54] back to the grain that's the bride age
[1:36:56] that's what the bride is supposed to be
[1:36:58] is the grain his very life jesus in
[1:37:01] bright form
[1:37:06] brother brown said at the end of
[1:37:08] anointed ones
[1:37:10] i wasn't the one appeared down on the
[1:37:11] river i was only standing there when he
[1:37:13] appeared
[1:37:14] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:37:16] things foretells these things that
[1:37:17] happen so perfect they are
[1:37:19] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[1:37:21] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:37:23] it
[1:37:24] i wasn't what i knew it's what i just
[1:37:26] surrendered myself to
[1:37:27] that i spoke through it isn't me it
[1:37:30] wasn't the seventh angel oh no
[1:37:32] it was the manifestation of the son of
[1:37:33] man
[1:37:35] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[1:37:37] the mystery that god unfolded
[1:37:40] it's not a man it's god
[1:37:45] i'd like to say it this way it's not you
[1:37:48] it's god you can say the same thing
[1:37:53] brother bam could say it's not me it's
[1:37:55] not me none of myself
[1:37:56] it's not my works or my ability it's not
[1:37:59] i'm living a nice life and i'm a nice
[1:38:00] person it's not me
[1:38:02] amen it's god inside of me god moving me
[1:38:05] in ways that i couldn't move before god
[1:38:08] bringing me into manifestations in
[1:38:09] places and faith that i never knew i had
[1:38:12] it's not me it's god god's doing the
[1:38:15] work
[1:38:20] he said the angel was not the son of man
[1:38:24] he was the messenger from the son of man
[1:38:26] the son of man is christ
[1:38:30] he's the one that you're feeding on
[1:38:37] you know you are what you eat
[1:38:40] if you eat the son of man you become
[1:38:45] you fill in the blanks
[1:38:48] the son of man's christ he's the one
[1:38:50] that you're feeding on you're not
[1:38:51] feeding on a man a man his words will
[1:38:53] fail but you're feeding on the
[1:38:54] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:38:59] when the son of man came the first time
[1:39:01] it was the full measure of the word on
[1:39:03] full display in a vessel
[1:39:05] and when the son of man comes in this
[1:39:07] time it's a full measure of the word on
[1:39:09] a full display
[1:39:10] in a many-membered vessel that's what
[1:39:13] he's desiring to do today friends
[1:39:15] and he wants to take your vessel and my
[1:39:17] vessel and he wants to manifest himself
[1:39:19] through us
[1:39:21] how by what fruit what will be the
[1:39:23] fruits of that
[1:39:25] it could be anything that's in the word
[1:39:28] but it will never be contrary to this
[1:39:31] word
[1:39:33] the fruit will be receiving the word for
[1:39:36] your day
[1:39:37] manifesting the word for your day being
[1:39:40] the bride
[1:39:43] things that are to be now if we are
[1:39:45] those attributes of god we cannot live
[1:39:47] by creeds
[1:39:48] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:39:51] must live by the word because the bride
[1:39:53] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[1:39:55] is part of her husband
[1:39:57] therefore we must be that word bride
[1:40:01] and what is the word bride the
[1:40:03] manifestation of this
[1:40:05] hour the bride
[1:40:08] the manifestation of this are the
[1:40:10] manifestation of the word for this day
[1:40:16] i ask you who do you say this is
[1:40:22] who do you say the son of man is
[1:40:25] because it is the son of man and grain
[1:40:26] again in bride form
[1:40:30] the question is who do you say this is
[1:40:33] that's a group of people with funny
[1:40:34] ideas and these ones believe this way
[1:40:35] and these ones believe this way
[1:40:38] or can you say that is christ
[1:40:41] the son of the living god this is none
[1:40:43] other than jesus christ
[1:40:45] working among his people you realize to
[1:40:48] come back to grain again does not mean
[1:40:50] to deliver a message to the people
[1:40:53] to put it on books and tapes and have
[1:40:54] the message in their pocket
[1:40:57] that was not the purpose of the son of
[1:41:00] man ministry
[1:41:00] that was not the purpose of the message
[1:41:03] so but so many times we've got the wrong
[1:41:05] idea
[1:41:06] we think of the message as the words
[1:41:11] on tape we think of the message
[1:41:15] as the books and the tapes and i've got
[1:41:18] the message and i've got this sd chip
[1:41:20] and i've got
[1:41:20] all the message you could have that sd
[1:41:23] chip and have
[1:41:24] none of the message because the message
[1:41:26] is christ it's back to grain again
[1:41:28] it's jesus christ it's jesus in bright
[1:41:31] form
[1:41:31] that's the message now you get it
[1:41:34] now you got it it's the very life of god
[1:41:37] it's the word that has come back been
[1:41:38] restored to the original faith
[1:41:40] back to the original word now that word
[1:41:43] is abiding in a people and
[1:41:44] living in flesh that's the son of man
[1:41:48] when the son of man was here before
[1:41:49] it was the word made manifest in human
[1:41:51] flesh and the son of man today
[1:41:53] is the word made manifest in human flesh
[1:41:57] the message is not what you have in your
[1:41:59] pocket the message is not what you have
[1:42:00] in your book
[1:42:01] amen the message is christ jesus
[1:42:04] in bride form the son of man the grain
[1:42:07] that went into the ground and died
[1:42:09] has come back in much fruit and that is
[1:42:12] christ
[1:42:13] the son of man christ the son of the
[1:42:16] living god
[1:42:18] but he's come in a form that wasn't
[1:42:20] expected
[1:42:22] and a plumber and a carpenter and a
[1:42:24] businessman and an accountant
[1:42:26] and a housewife and a store clerk and
[1:42:31] i didn't expect that to be the son of
[1:42:33] man
[1:42:34] like i can see it in brother branham
[1:42:37] there's the son of man
[1:42:39] i see that i'm telling you if you leave
[1:42:41] it there
[1:42:42] you're the same place that believers
[1:42:43] were in ephesus
[1:42:46] you're preaching the same thing apollos
[1:42:48] preached not a bad man a good man a
[1:42:50] lovely man
[1:42:50] a seed of god but he had to know the way
[1:42:53] of life
[1:42:54] more perfectly amen
[1:42:58] that's the son of man no that was the
[1:43:02] son of man
[1:43:04] that was the revealing of the son of man
[1:43:06] that was the coming of the son of man
[1:43:08] that was the testimony to the royal seed
[1:43:10] like on the plains of memory
[1:43:14] but that testimony changed the bride
[1:43:18] to receive the seed to bring forth the
[1:43:22] word
[1:43:23] because that's what happened to sarah
[1:43:28] because the bride is part of the
[1:43:29] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[1:43:31] husband
[1:43:33] therefore we must be the word bride and
[1:43:34] what is the word bride
[1:43:36] the manifestation of this hour
[1:43:42] what is the fruit brother brahm told us
[1:43:45] to look for
[1:43:47] the teaching the doc the
[1:43:51] the the miracles of janice and jeremy
[1:43:53] were fine
[1:43:56] the prophecy of balaam was fine it was
[1:43:59] the teaching that was false
[1:44:02] teaching that were in that that there's
[1:44:05] some other manifestation
[1:44:07] for this day because what is the word
[1:44:10] bride
[1:44:11] the manifestation of this hour
[1:44:15] the bride not a creed or denomination
[1:44:18] but a living oracle of god a living
[1:44:20] attribute of god
[1:44:22] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:44:24] of god
[1:44:25] in the formation of the bride that's to
[1:44:28] be expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:44:30] living
[1:44:32] who do you say this is it's none other
[1:44:35] than jesus christ
[1:44:37] the son of the living god but it's come
[1:44:40] in an unexpected way
[1:44:41] yeah when i was a little kid i didn't
[1:44:43] expect it
[1:44:46] peter didn't expect it paul didn't
[1:44:48] expect it
[1:44:49] but god knew brother branham didn't
[1:44:52] expect it
[1:44:54] but god knew
[1:44:57] jehovah jiren 1964
[1:45:01] just believe just have faith now don't
[1:45:03] no one move around just sit real rev
[1:45:05] i want you to imagine standing before
[1:45:07] you and here somewhere christ
[1:45:10] this is what brother bran now let's just
[1:45:11] put ourselves in his words
[1:45:14] don't move around be real reverent
[1:45:17] i want you to imagine standing before
[1:45:19] you in here somewhere christ
[1:45:23] raised up from the dead come right
[1:45:25] through the walls one time eat bread
[1:45:27] feel me on flesh and bones and
[1:45:28] disappeared right before them now
[1:45:33] brother was telling them to get a mental
[1:45:35] image
[1:45:36] of jesus christ standing here like he
[1:45:37] walked through on the disciples one day
[1:45:41] he said now he promised that he would
[1:45:45] appear in the last days
[1:45:48] in the form of human flesh again
[1:45:58] he did that brother branham i agree
[1:46:01] but can i read the quote
[1:46:05] he promised that he would appear in the
[1:46:06] last days in the form of human flesh
[1:46:08] again
[1:46:09] in your flesh
[1:46:13] like he did at the days of sodom
[1:46:18] god which was christ manifest in the
[1:46:20] flesh
[1:46:21] now in his church his bride see they're
[1:46:24] coming together
[1:46:25] it's uniting time churches are uniting
[1:46:27] nations are uniting
[1:46:28] and the bride in christ is uniting
[1:46:32] back to the grain itself again back to
[1:46:35] the original word
[1:46:36] when i come on the earth when the son of
[1:46:38] man comes will he
[1:46:40] find faith and the answer is yes because
[1:46:43] there's a bride that was here to receive
[1:46:45] it
[1:46:45] when he came
[1:46:48] that question has been answered brother
[1:46:51] bam said will malachi 4 be fulfilled
[1:46:53] a restoration back to the order of faith
[1:46:55] the answer is yes because god saw to it
[1:46:57] that there was a predestinated people
[1:46:59] with something inside of them that could
[1:47:00] receive that word and say that's my lord
[1:47:04] that's nothing but the truth
[1:47:09] he promised oh i just love this quote
[1:47:12] that he would appear in the last days
[1:47:16] in the form of human flesh again in your
[1:47:19] flesh
[1:47:21] back to the grain what he told the
[1:47:23] greeks was a prophecy of our day
[1:47:27] and we're the manifestation of that
[1:47:29] prophecy
[1:47:30] that's why jesus promised we would be
[1:47:32] here today let's turn to colossians
[1:47:38] musicians you can come if you'd like
[1:47:41] blake if you'd like to come colossians
[1:47:44] chapter 1
[1:47:47] verse 26.
[1:47:51] colossians 1 26
[1:47:54] even the mystery which had been hid from
[1:47:56] ages and from generations
[1:47:59] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:48:02] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:48:04] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:48:06] among the gentiles
[1:48:07] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:48:12] the same thing jesus said to the greeks
[1:48:15] now paul lays down the prophecy in the
[1:48:19] great mystery
[1:48:20] but now we're at the days of the
[1:48:22] fulfilling of this word
[1:48:25] and the fruit that janice and jemerys
[1:48:28] brought forth
[1:48:29] were not believing the word resisting
[1:48:32] the truth and reprobates concerning
[1:48:34] the faith balaam brought forth a true
[1:48:38] prophecy
[1:48:39] with a true gift under a true anointing
[1:48:41] but he had a false teaching
[1:48:44] but now we've been taught by the prophet
[1:48:46] himself that this is grain time
[1:48:50] this is jesus in the form of the bride
[1:48:53] this is the son of man the grain
[1:48:56] returned back to a head again at the end
[1:48:58] of the church
[1:48:58] ages when everything else has died
[1:49:00] brought up to a bright age to the
[1:49:01] harvest time
[1:49:02] and now jesus christ wants to be
[1:49:04] displayed the manifested word today
[1:49:07] is the bride
[1:49:12] that's where we're at that's
[1:49:16] who we are not by merit
[1:49:19] not by choice but by predestination
[1:49:23] and he's not looking for efforts and
[1:49:25] he's not looking for skills
[1:49:27] he's looking for someone that will
[1:49:29] humble themselves and allow him to have
[1:49:30] the preeminence so that he can show that
[1:49:32] the grain is in your flesh
[1:49:34] amen it's not going to be you you've got
[1:49:37] to say just like brother ben
[1:49:38] i wasn't the one who came in the river
[1:49:40] that day i wasn't the one who said those
[1:49:42] things
[1:49:42] i wasn't the one who knew what was sick
[1:49:44] with you and i'm not the one who healed
[1:49:45] you brother versus you didn't touch me
[1:49:47] he you touched him i'm just a man
[1:49:50] i could do nothing for you in my flesh
[1:49:52] it's not me it's not my flesh it's not
[1:49:54] the birth of parents amen
[1:49:55] you realize it's god who predestinated
[1:49:57] me to this position before the
[1:49:59] foundation of the world
[1:50:00] i'm his bride and the manifestation of
[1:50:02] the word for this day
[1:50:04] because he said so
[1:50:07] and now the only thing i can do is just
[1:50:10] humble myself
[1:50:11] die to myself and surrender to that
[1:50:13] being true
[1:50:15] and let him have his way stay humble
[1:50:19] stay submissive stay dead
[1:50:22] but now it's back to the grain again the
[1:50:25] son of man is here
[1:50:27] he's promised to return appear at the
[1:50:30] end time in human flesh
[1:50:33] in your flesh
[1:50:36] don't deny it don't fear it
[1:50:40] don't push it away just say lord i
[1:50:43] believe it
[1:50:45] lord i believe it now help me god
[1:50:49] let's all stand

[1:51:17] shines all around

[1:51:43] comes where the two
[1:51:47] mercy our bride
[1:51:51] shines all around us
[1:52:06] [Music]

[1:52:14] god sometimes your word is overwhelming
[1:52:17] lord
[1:52:18] the reality of it lord takes our breath
[1:52:20] away
[1:52:22] but yet we believe it lord we know it's
[1:52:25] the truth lord
[1:52:26] sometimes we don't know what to do or
[1:52:28] how to do or
[1:52:30] we don't know lord how to be what you've
[1:52:32] called us to be
[1:52:33] intellectually we can't fathom it lord
[1:52:36] in our own will we can't perform it

[1:52:41] reality for this day

[1:52:46] the form you've chosen to come in in
[1:52:47] this day

[1:52:51] to manifest the son of man
[1:52:53] in we want to say lord have your way in
