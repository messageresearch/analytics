[10:39] god bless you this evening let's just
[10:41] pray together
[10:44] precious lord jesus we just
[10:47] truly want to come and to say praise our
[10:49] god
[10:51] lord and as we've
[10:53] sang the songs of zion and we have
[10:56] lifted up our hands to you lord may we
[10:59] at this point in time just completely
[11:01] open our hearts to you lord
[11:03] father and we're just so grateful for
[11:05] this opportunity that you have provided
[11:07] to us
[11:08] to once again
[11:10] come and together around you lord jesus
[11:13] the revealed word for our age
[11:15] lord and we're so grateful that we can
[11:17] stand here as a chosen people when we
[11:19] can sing a song to praise our god
[11:23] lord that you have given us i salve to
[11:25] see in what form that you have came in
[11:28] in our day in our age and we don't stand
[11:30] here worshiping a god of our a figment
[11:33] of our imagination or some feeling or
[11:36] something that we would project to be a
[11:38] god but you have given us eyes to see
[11:41] your word lord and a revelation to know
[11:43] that you are your word and you are the
[11:45] spirit of the truth
[11:47] and that is our god and that is who we
[11:50] come to worship here this evening that
[11:52] is who we come to bow ourselves down
[11:54] before this evening because we are wrong
[11:57] lord but you are right and we want to
[12:00] worship you and give you the proper
[12:01] place
[12:02] father we would just ask now that you
[12:04] would come
[12:06] lord and that you would do what only you
[12:08] can do lord and that you would take the
[12:10] book and that you would loose the seals
[12:12] father and that you would take the bread
[12:14] and that you would break and that you
[12:15] would feed your children lord for no man
[12:18] is capable or even worthy to do this
[12:21] father but you are lord and we would
[12:23] just ask that you would come and do that
[12:25] that you would have the preeminence lord
[12:27] and that you would accomplish what you
[12:29] have supernaturally and uh predestinated
[12:32] this service to accomplish in the name
[12:34] of the lord jesus christ we pray
[12:37] amen
[12:39] god bless you this evening if you'll
[12:41] take your bibles we're going to
[12:43] go to john chapter 14.
[12:48] i'm sorry john chapter 16
[12:51] john chapter 16
[12:54] to bring you
[12:55] greetings from our pastor he
[12:58] sent me a message today that all is well
[13:01] on that side of the world that they had
[13:03] arrived safely had their first service
[13:05] everything had went really well so we're
[13:09] thankful for that and we'll just
[13:10] continue to remember them in prayer
[13:12] i'd just like to
[13:14] take a moment to say i appreciate our
[13:16] pastor
[13:17] and i believe he's a great man of god he
[13:21] continues has been and continues to be a
[13:25] great inspiration and a blessing to me
[13:27] and i have to take advantage of the
[13:30] times that he's not here to say those
[13:31] kind of things because if he's here he
[13:33] starts getting red in the face and
[13:35] starts looking down at the floor and
[13:37] maybe kicking his feet around a little
[13:39] bit and i know i'm getting in deep water
[13:41] it's kind of like when he
[13:43] holds up the sign and just says be quiet
[13:45] and start preaching so
[13:47] we have to take advantage of those
[13:49] opportunities but i do have a quote for
[13:51] it and brother branham said i would
[13:52] rather give a man a rose on this side
[13:53] than give him a whole wreath when he
[13:55] when he's gone so i don't i don't think
[13:58] he wants to argue with me about that
[13:59] when i i have quotes on my side so
[14:03] but i know you all feel the same way and
[14:04] we just appreciate him and we miss him
[14:06] when he's gone and uh we only have two
[14:09] services left till he's back just in
[14:11] case anybody's counting
[14:12] but uh we just pray that god would be
[14:14] with him and accomplish
[14:16] what what has been ordained to
[14:18] accomplish there
[14:20] let's uh
[14:21] pick up here in verse 12 chapter 16
[14:24] verse 12.
[14:25] and i just want to continue with this
[14:28] thought that we had been speaking of
[14:30] the
[14:31] last time on he the spirit of truth
[14:34] and i didn't get very far last time and
[14:37] that's you're all's fault you all
[14:40] are to blame for that but that's okay
[14:41] we'll just keep plucking along and see
[14:44] how far we get this time but in verse 12
[14:48] chapter 16 of john it says
[14:50] i have yet many things to say unto you
[14:53] but you cannot bear them now
[14:56] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[14:59] come
[15:00] he will guide you into all truth for he
[15:02] shall not speak of himself
[15:04] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[15:07] he speak
[15:08] and he will show you things to come
[15:11] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[15:13] of mine and shall show it unto you god
[15:16] bless you as you would have your seats
[15:20] and if you'll just give me the benefit
[15:22] to recap just a little bit here
[15:24] this is an extremely important portion
[15:27] of scripture as we would approach this
[15:29] topic because this portion of scripture
[15:33] emphatically declares to us that the
[15:36] spirit of truth is he
[15:39] and he is a personal pronoun reference
[15:41] to a person
[15:42] so it's a declaration that this spirit
[15:45] of truth is not the spirit of some
[15:47] man-made idea or some denomination or
[15:50] some object somewhere but the spirit of
[15:53] truth is a spirit of a living person
[15:58] um so that is if you would want to say a
[16:01] foundation piece for this topic because
[16:04] we know the spirit of truth as we
[16:06] studied last time the spirit of truth
[16:08] is the holy spirit it is the holy ghost
[16:12] it is the token
[16:14] it is the new birth so there is a lot of
[16:17] terminology that you can put to this one
[16:19] topic but at the end of the day we never
[16:22] want to deviate from the revelation that
[16:24] this is a person
[16:26] and this person is none other than the
[16:28] person of god himself
[16:31] so
[16:34] when you receive the new birth
[16:37] when you receive the holy ghost when you
[16:39] receive the spirit of truth
[16:42] we are receiving the spirit of god
[16:45] himself
[16:47] i don't think we fully grasp
[16:50] and understand that
[16:53] i'm not saying that i i'm not declaring
[16:55] that i do
[16:57] but brother brennan made a comment he
[17:00] said one of these days
[17:02] you're going to find out
[17:04] god is in you
[17:08] one of these days you're going to find
[17:10] out that god is in you
[17:13] that's very very significant
[17:16] first john 5 says
[17:19] this is he that came by water and blood
[17:21] even jesus christ not by water only but
[17:24] by water and blood and it is the spirit
[17:26] that bear beareth witness because the
[17:28] spirit
[17:29] is truth so now we would go to another
[17:32] very foundational statement here
[17:36] to not try to separate the spirit and
[17:38] the truth and i should have gave you my
[17:39] disclaimer from the beginning if you
[17:41] hear some things that our pastor has
[17:42] been teaching on or that's already been
[17:44] said i apologize for that but it is what
[17:48] it is and i would like to think that as
[17:50] i would mature as a minister that i
[17:52] would start getting comfortable with the
[17:53] fact that people were going to preach
[17:55] things that i've already been looking at
[17:56] and people are already going to say
[17:57] things that i've been looking at and i'm
[17:59] going to say things that people are
[18:00] already preached so it is what it is but
[18:03] again i have word for that because jesus
[18:05] himself came along and he said verily
[18:07] verily so he said it and then he said it
[18:09] again so i think jesus is still in the
[18:11] business of saying verily verily now he
[18:13] may say it on a sunday and then again on
[18:15] a wednesday he may not say it back to
[18:17] back but i still believe he's in the
[18:18] business of saying verily verily
[18:21] but we never want to deviate away from
[18:23] this revelation that the spirit and the
[18:26] truth are the self same being they are
[18:28] the same thing and you will not get the
[18:29] spirit i'll say this you will not get
[18:31] the true spirit without the without the
[18:34] truth without the word brother brandon
[18:36] says that that word has to come first
[18:39] that word has to come in first that word
[18:41] has to already be there in order for it
[18:44] to be quickened
[18:45] so first john 5 6 and 7 gives us that
[18:48] revelation there
[18:50] continuing in verse 7 it says for there
[18:52] are three that bear record in heaven the
[18:54] father the word
[18:56] and the holy ghost and these three are
[18:59] one
[19:01] first john 4 6 says we are of god he
[19:04] that knoweth god heareth us but he that
[19:06] is not of god heareth not us
[19:08] hereby we know the spirit of truth and
[19:10] the spirit of error
[19:12] so if you hear the true word of god
[19:15] there is only one spirit that will
[19:16] declare that to you
[19:18] anything else
[19:20] is in error
[19:21] ephesians 5 verse 8 says for ye were
[19:24] sometimes in darkness but now you are in
[19:26] light in the lord walk as children of
[19:29] light
[19:29] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[19:32] goodness and righteousness and truth and
[19:35] again i'm just recapping these
[19:36] scriptures because i want to
[19:38] make sure that that is very fresh in
[19:40] your mind that this spirit that we are
[19:43] after that we are seeking this spirit of
[19:45] god is the spirit of truth
[19:48] so if we want the spirit of god we have
[19:51] to seek
[19:52] and
[19:54] die to our own selves and seek the
[19:56] spirit of truth that is what we're after
[19:58] if we receive the spirit of truth we've
[20:00] got what we're after
[20:03] but we're not going to get what we're
[20:04] after without getting the truth
[20:06] and recognizing the truth
[20:10] john 14 17 says even the spirit of truth
[20:13] whom the world cannot receive because it
[20:15] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[20:17] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[20:20] shall be in you
[20:22] i will not leave you comfortless i
[20:25] again person
[20:27] i don't think that we can overemphasize
[20:30] that because the denominational world
[20:32] has made the holy spirit everything else
[20:35] but the person
[20:37] i would say that is one of them one of
[20:39] the
[20:40] basic and most important things that was
[20:42] loosed under the preaching of the seals
[20:44] and under the revelation of the seals
[20:45] and the losing of the book that he the
[20:48] spirit of truth is the person the holy
[20:50] ghost is a person the holy spirit is a
[20:53] person the evidence of receiving the
[20:55] holy spirit is receiving the person
[20:57] because you then act like that person
[20:59] you don't act like a denominational idea
[21:01] you don't act like anything else you
[21:03] will act like the person of christ
[21:07] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[21:10] come to you john 15 26 says but when the
[21:13] comforter is come whom i will send you
[21:17] unto you from the father even the spirit
[21:19] of truth which proceedeth from from the
[21:22] father
[21:23] he shall testify of me
[21:25] and ye shall also bear witness because
[21:27] ye have been with me from the beginning
[21:30] so now again we have another terminology
[21:32] come into this we have the spirit of
[21:33] truth we have the holy spirit we have
[21:35] the token we have the new birth but now
[21:38] jesus is saying when the comforter comes
[21:42] and this is i would say a lot of where
[21:44] my inspiration for this is coming
[21:45] because
[21:46] i'm going to use thousands and thousands
[21:49] of words to talk on this topic and teach
[21:50] on this topic but really my inspiration
[21:52] and really where i'm wanting to get to
[21:54] is addressing the problem of knowing
[21:59] what we're seeking for
[22:03] knowing what we're seeking for when we
[22:05] talk and we speak about the holy spirit
[22:11] that's really what i want to address is
[22:13] the uncertainty of what am i seeking for
[22:16] what am i after what do i need
[22:19] because if we don't know what we're
[22:21] seeking for we're not going to recognize
[22:23] what we've got if we receive it
[22:26] and furthermore we can receive something
[22:30] i believe we can genuinely receive
[22:32] something and still not have the
[22:34] comforter of knowing what we've received
[22:37] and that's the spirit that i want to
[22:40] expose that i want to deal with if we
[22:43] want to you know get all pentecostal we
[22:45] can say that we want to jump on his head
[22:47] and give him a black eye and whatever
[22:50] but i just want to expose that and i
[22:52] want to settle that because what comes
[22:54] with that spirit
[22:55] is what brother branham says is a plague
[22:58] on the age and the plague on the age is
[23:00] a nervous tension
[23:02] so with that spirit of uncertainty there
[23:05] comes
[23:07] the plague of the age the nervous
[23:09] tension because you don't know where you
[23:11] stand with god because you don't know
[23:13] what you're seeking or you don't know
[23:14] what you've got
[23:17] but if we are able to answer the
[23:19] question
[23:20] of what he is what it is that i'm
[23:23] seeking what is the holy spirit what is
[23:25] the token what is the new birth what is
[23:27] the comforter if we're able to properly
[23:30] identify that and know
[23:32] that for certainty
[23:35] that's going to alleviate that nervous
[23:37] tension
[23:38] maybe not in your spirit realm not in
[23:40] your flesh realm but in the innermost
[23:42] being
[23:43] you're going to know that you know that
[23:45] you know
[23:48] and
[23:50] that's just a spirit that i'm not very
[23:52] fond of when i see people that are
[23:54] unsettled when i see people that are
[23:56] uncertain
[23:57] that bothers me i do not like that um
[24:01] and i don't like it in myself and i'm
[24:02] not saying that i fully arrived yet
[24:05] so
[24:06] i just want to address that spirit
[24:08] because when we're standing in
[24:10] uncertainty we have no power
[24:13] and again i'm not preaching this as
[24:15] power to you know
[24:17] go out and do great mighty miracles and
[24:20] manifestations
[24:21] and you know things that maybe would be
[24:24] visible i believe those things will be
[24:26] there i believe those things are there i
[24:27] believe in all of those things you all
[24:29] know me well enough to know that but i'm
[24:32] talking about the power to stand
[24:36] the power to stand when everybody and
[24:38] everything else falls away
[24:40] i'm talking about the power of certainty
[24:42] to know that i have met god and i have
[24:46] met his requirements the power that job
[24:48] had
[24:50] the even when your friends come your
[24:52] closest friends your religious friends
[24:55] come and try to talk to you in a
[24:58] different way or to shed a different
[24:59] light
[25:00] the power to know that you know
[25:03] so
[25:04] again there's lots of things that we're
[25:06] going to say here but that's really the
[25:08] inspiration that i want to address here
[25:11] is we don't want to be going from pillar
[25:13] to post we don't want to be swayed we
[25:15] want to be solid we want to be stable
[25:18] and we want to be steadfast and we want
[25:20] to know who we are
[25:23] we want to know that we have met the
[25:24] requirements and in order to meet that
[25:26] requirement we obviously have to know
[25:28] what that requirement is
[25:31] but when we do
[25:32] when we do that i am thoroughly
[25:34] convinced and i have had the experience
[25:37] just like many of you
[25:38] uh can testify as well when we arrive at
[25:41] that point
[25:43] john 15
[25:44] and 26 comes into effect because we have
[25:47] the comforter
[25:50] we have the comforter
[25:51] and again this is a situation to where
[25:53] you can fool your neighbor you can fool
[25:55] the person sitting beside of you you can
[25:56] fool your pastor you can fool your mom
[25:58] you can fool your dad you can fool
[25:59] everybody else but you know
[26:02] the man
[26:04] inside of the man inside of the man
[26:06] whether he's right or not
[26:09] and i'm not interested in fooling people
[26:11] i'm not interested in you fooling people
[26:13] i'm not interested in those types of
[26:15] things but i'm interested in
[26:18] myself and as a body
[26:22] the inside man the innermost being
[26:25] knowing i'm right with god
[26:27] that i'm standing with a clear
[26:29] conscience that my heart is pure i have
[26:31] met the requirements and i have the
[26:33] comforter with me
[26:37] verse 27 and it says ye also shall bear
[26:40] witness because you have been with me
[26:42] from the beginning
[26:44] we are not going to be able to bear the
[26:47] proper witness witness is testimony
[26:50] manifestation we are not going to be
[26:53] able to bear that
[26:55] and reflect that and project that
[26:59] if we do not have this proper
[27:01] understanding
[27:02] so the point of the comforter of coming
[27:05] is that we can then display something
[27:07] just as uh you know brother chad was
[27:09] preaching the last couple of services
[27:11] the purpose
[27:12] for that light to have come so that it
[27:14] can continue its manifestation
[27:16] so we want to fulfill our portion in the
[27:19] scripture here but we're not going to be
[27:21] able to do that without a proper
[27:23] understanding
[27:25] ephesians 1 verse 12 says that we should
[27:27] be to the praise of his glory who first
[27:29] trusted in christ in whom ye also
[27:32] trusted after that ye heard the word of
[27:34] truth
[27:36] in whom ye also trusted after
[27:41] ye heard the word of truth so if you're
[27:44] trusting in something before you've
[27:46] heard the word of truth that's probably
[27:48] your own idea
[27:50] but when you have heard the word of
[27:52] truth from he who god has sent
[27:56] and you have trusted in that
[28:00] now you have access to the comforter
[28:02] continuing it says in whom you also
[28:04] trusted trusted after you heard the word
[28:06] of truth the gospel of your salvation in
[28:09] whom also after that ye believed you
[28:12] were sealed with that holy spirit so
[28:15] this is a ceiling that comes after you
[28:19] have heard the truth
[28:21] the only way to hear that truth is
[28:23] through he is through he whom god hath
[28:26] sent
[28:29] not somebody else
[28:34] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[28:37] until the redemption of the purchased
[28:39] possession
[28:40] unto the praise of his glory
[28:43] and future home brother branham says
[28:44] then jesus said in john 14 when he the
[28:47] holy ghost is come he will bring these
[28:49] things to your memory he will show you
[28:52] what day you're living in so look at the
[28:54] attributes that's starting to come forth
[28:56] now from the holy spirit from the token
[28:58] from the comforter from the spirit of
[29:00] truth
[29:01] it's going to show you what day you're
[29:03] living in
[29:04] it's going to it's going to reveal to
[29:06] you your proper positional placing
[29:08] spiritually
[29:10] this is an evidence this is a
[29:12] manifestation this is a work of the holy
[29:14] spirit
[29:16] we can make it a lot of things
[29:18] the world in the denominational world
[29:20] has made it a lot of things but this is
[29:22] this is what i want to do i want to
[29:24] bring it back to a scriptural standpoint
[29:26] i want to bring it back to what the
[29:28] prophet taught us
[29:30] because if we don't stick with what he
[29:32] taught us and what this what he
[29:34] expounded from the scriptures we're
[29:36] going to make he the spirit of truth
[29:38] something that he the spirit of truth is
[29:40] not and we're going to make his
[29:42] manifestation something that they are
[29:44] not
[29:46] and then another thing you'll know him
[29:48] he will show you things to come see
[29:51] right back to the prophetic again
[29:53] when he's come
[29:56] john 6 63 it is the spirit that
[29:58] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[30:01] nothing
[30:02] the words that i speak to you they are
[30:04] spirit and they are life again we cannot
[30:08] separate the two
[30:12] john 6 28
[30:14] then said they unto him what shall we do
[30:16] that we might work the works of god
[30:19] jesus answered and said unto them this
[30:21] is the work of god
[30:23] that ye believe on whom he hath sent
[30:26] again that's what i would term a
[30:28] baseline evidence for all believers
[30:31] there may be many many many and no doubt
[30:34] there is vast manifestations of the
[30:36] working of the holy spirit but the the
[30:39] baseline evidence of the indwelling
[30:42] person of christ
[30:44] as you will believe on he whom he hath
[30:46] sent
[30:48] that is one manifestation that every
[30:51] believer every true believer will never
[30:54] deviate away from and must have
[30:57] john 8 42 says jesus said unto them if
[31:00] god were your father you would have
[31:02] loved me
[31:03] for i proceedeth forth and came from god
[31:05] neither came i of myself but he sent me
[31:08] why do you not understand my speech even
[31:10] because you cannot hear my word
[31:13] ye are of your father the devil and the
[31:15] lust of your father ye will do he was a
[31:17] murderer from the beginning and abode
[31:19] not in the truth because there is no
[31:22] truth in him
[31:24] when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of
[31:27] his own for he is a liar and the father
[31:29] of it and because i tell you the truth
[31:32] you believe me not
[31:34] so jesus himself is coming along and he
[31:37] is tying these things together the
[31:39] reason that you can hear my words and
[31:40] receive my spirit is because the father
[31:44] we in another portion of scripture says
[31:46] because you have already been taught of
[31:48] the father
[31:49] so it because you have the element of
[31:51] the word laying in you it gives you the
[31:53] capability to hear the truth to hear my
[31:56] word and again as we you you know said
[31:59] probably a thousand times last time i
[32:01] don't think we can over emphasize that
[32:03] we cannot overemphasize the fact that we
[32:07] have a capability to hear
[32:09] and respond and yield to the true word
[32:12] of god
[32:13] there is only one class of people that
[32:15] has that capability
[32:18] the devil can run you around the bushel
[32:21] and everything else and all your
[32:22] mistakes and failures and faults but
[32:24] that is one thing that he can never
[32:26] trump the capability to hear and receive
[32:31] and yield to the true word of god for
[32:33] your age is only given to one class of
[32:36] people
[32:37] her name is mrs jesus christ
[32:43] we take that for granted saints we take
[32:46] that for granted i know i do
[32:49] i know i do
[32:50] because it's so common to us and it
[32:52] should be common to us because brother
[32:54] branham says a true believer his faith
[32:56] to him is just common faith it's just
[32:59] everyday living
[33:00] so we operate in that word in that realm
[33:02] and we should operate in that realm
[33:05] brother bran says real faith he says
[33:06] your unconscious to it it's just there
[33:10] but i think every once in a while we
[33:12] should take some time
[33:14] and recognize and give thanks
[33:17] for having the capability to hear the
[33:19] voice
[33:21] that god has sent us a voice we we are
[33:24] blessed just to have him sent us a voice
[33:28] we are blessed just to
[33:30] physically and carnally have that voice
[33:33] strike our eardrums
[33:36] but to be a class of people
[33:40] that that can now go from our ear to our
[33:43] heart
[33:44] and then have a result that we set aside
[33:47] our mindset and our wants and our
[33:50] desires and our thinking and yield to
[33:52] that
[33:54] with saints without that
[33:56] without that capability we're lost
[34:01] without that capability to hear and
[34:04] yield to that voice we are cannon fodder
[34:08] in the best case scenario
[34:12] we should never never take that for
[34:14] granted and i just want to testify
[34:16] tonight that i'm thankful for that i am
[34:19] thankful number one that he sent me a
[34:21] voice
[34:22] i'm so grateful for that
[34:24] but i am so grateful that he gave me
[34:27] something on the inside of the inside
[34:29] to be able to respond to that voice to
[34:32] be able to recognize that as truth
[34:39] i'm going to skip just a little bit here
[34:49] brother branham says and ashamed
[34:55] he says when a man ever meets god
[34:59] not in some emotional work up some
[35:01] enthusiasm or some religious doctrine
[35:04] some catechism or creed or a dog dogma
[35:06] that he has accepted for a comfort for
[35:08] himself
[35:09] but when he really comes to the place
[35:11] like moses did on the backside of the
[35:13] desert to walk up to face to face with
[35:15] almighty god
[35:17] and you see the voice speaking to you
[35:21] remember he's talking about looking god
[35:23] face to face
[35:26] when you see the voice speaking to you
[35:29] exactly with the word and the promise of
[35:31] the hour it does something to you
[35:34] see you're not ashamed of it it does
[35:37] something to you and remember you might
[35:39] need a spirit that would act like god
[35:44] you might meet a spirit that would do
[35:46] this that or the other follow it a
[35:48] little bit and see how it compares with
[35:50] the word of god
[35:53] you might meet a spirit that would tell
[35:55] you you are saved and give you a
[35:57] glorious feeling and you would shout and
[36:00] scream and then when it comes to denying
[36:02] the word how can the holy spirit that
[36:04] wrote the word deny his own word that
[36:06] spirit must punctuate every promise of
[36:09] god within a man if it isn't then you
[36:14] never met god
[36:18] you met a deceiving spirit
[36:20] and the world is full of it today
[36:24] so again we're coming to that razor's
[36:26] edge that he talked about we're coming
[36:28] to where a person or people
[36:31] would be interacting with a spirit
[36:34] acting like god
[36:39] acting like god
[36:41] remember god is the word so if this if
[36:43] this is a spirit acting like god
[36:46] and it's a shrewd spirit and a deceiving
[36:49] spirit what do you think it's going to
[36:51] be riding on when it comes your way
[36:54] it's going to be riding on a white horse
[36:57] a slight deviation but it's going to be
[37:00] packing a lot of word
[37:03] but it has to be a deceiving spirit
[37:05] acting like god because what you're
[37:07] seeking is god
[37:09] so it wants to give you what you're
[37:11] seeking without you really getting what
[37:13] you're seeking
[37:14] so the only way that it can do that is
[37:16] to do exactly what it did to eve
[37:19] eve's desire was not ungodly
[37:21] seeking god is not ungodly
[37:24] eve's desire to re multiply and
[37:27] reproduce
[37:28] was not ungodly
[37:30] her motherly desire was not ungodly but
[37:33] remember what her desire was it was to
[37:36] be a mother
[37:38] so satan did not come to her telling her
[37:41] how to sew better
[37:44] how to cook better
[37:47] how to till the garden better
[37:49] what did he come riding to her on
[37:53] her desire
[37:55] with a slight deviation
[37:59] a deceiving spirit acting like god
[38:03] did he not do exactly that
[38:06] to the point that he told her if you
[38:08] will partake of this word that i'm
[38:10] offering to you
[38:11] you will become as god
[38:15] is this not the exact thing that the
[38:18] holy spirit does to us
[38:20] when we receive god we become part of
[38:23] god
[38:24] so we see the pattern in the beginning
[38:27] don't think that we get down here to the
[38:29] end of the time and all of a sudden here
[38:31] we come with a godly desire of seeking
[38:33] the holy spirit and
[38:35] satan's going to come to us with
[38:36] something out in left field
[38:38] no he's going to come to us with a
[38:40] spirit acting like god
[38:44] riding on a slight deviation of the word
[38:52] you say that's pretty scary i would
[38:54] agree it's pretty scary
[38:56] but this saints is exactly why the seals
[39:00] had to be loosed
[39:03] remember there was a lot of information
[39:05] under the seals
[39:07] but there were spiritual principles that
[39:09] were loosed under the seals that were
[39:11] taught under the seals and that was what
[39:13] we were after
[39:15] so brother branham can come along and in
[39:16] five seconds revealed that the white
[39:17] horse rider is satan
[39:20] he re he reveals the symbols of the book
[39:22] in five seconds or less
[39:24] but he says we can take this topic and
[39:26] we can preach months and months and
[39:28] months on it and never touch it
[39:30] why because he knows the spiritual
[39:33] principle that's being loosed
[39:36] so the loosing of the seals is not just
[39:40] necessarily
[39:42] to understand the interpretation of the
[39:44] symbols although it is
[39:46] remember there's seals on the book and
[39:48] there's seals on the backs in the book
[39:50] and seals on the back side of the book
[39:52] but the reason this is so important to
[39:55] us is because brother branham comes and
[39:57] he says now we have the devil's answer
[40:01] this is after the seals he says now we
[40:04] have the devil's answer how do we have
[40:07] the devil's answer because the seals
[40:10] revealed the devil's tactics
[40:16] i can't say this the way that i'm
[40:17] wanting to say this i just i hope that
[40:19] you can understand
[40:21] because the seals
[40:26] revealed satan's tactics
[40:30] we can then garner the truth from it
[40:35] because if we know this that the devil's
[40:38] tactics and what he's to do
[40:41] we can combat that by not taking that
[40:45] route
[40:48] so by default if we know what the enemy
[40:50] is going to do and we do opposite of
[40:52] that we get the right thing
[40:56] so even if the seals
[40:58] when they were preached and when they
[41:00] were broken even if the seals did
[41:03] nothing
[41:05] but reveal what the devil's tactics were
[41:08] and i may be wrong but i'm of the
[41:10] opinion that was the main thrust of them
[41:14] even if they did nothing but that by
[41:17] default it would reveal to us what we
[41:19] needed to do
[41:22] and remember when we look at the seals
[41:24] and even if you look at the symbols
[41:26] within the book the symbols within the
[41:28] book are speaking of satan
[41:30] because it's talking about a white horse
[41:32] going forth
[41:34] so even the symbols within the book are
[41:36] talking about satan it's not talking
[41:38] necessarily about
[41:40] seeing christ
[41:41] you understand what i'm saying it's a
[41:43] it's a white horse that goes forth and
[41:45] that's satan and then it's a red horse
[41:48] and that's satan and then a black horse
[41:50] and that satan and a pell horse that
[41:51] said it's talking a lot about the enemy
[41:54] the symbols themselves and if you go
[41:57] back and study the seals you will you
[41:58] will notice that even in the preaching
[42:00] of the seals he is dwelling primarily on
[42:04] the enemy
[42:06] but what is he doing
[42:08] he's revealing the enemy
[42:10] and that is why the seals had to be
[42:12] loosed
[42:14] because the enemy had to be exposed in
[42:17] order for us to know how to combat that
[42:21] because in the last days perilous times
[42:23] shall come
[42:26] and there will be wolves and sheep
[42:27] closing
[42:29] on a white horse
[42:31] with a slight deviation of the message
[42:35] and they'll fight for that
[42:38] and they'll cause spiritual famine
[42:41] and they will cause death
[42:43] reading quotes
[42:45] and speaking what the prophet spoke
[42:50] and that would be a problem and that is
[42:52] a problem
[42:53] but i'll give you a greater problem
[42:56] is when we read the same quotes in the
[42:57] same scriptures and we take our own
[42:58] understanding
[43:00] and we don't even let a wolf in sheep
[43:01] clothing give us that
[43:03] but we want to cling to our own ideas
[43:07] and not bring it subject to the voice
[43:10] and whom he hath sent
[43:14] because when that is happening
[43:16] it is not going to be something totally
[43:18] out in the left field most of the time
[43:20] it is not going to be something way off
[43:23] what it's going to be is it's going to
[43:24] be a slight deviation of the world word
[43:27] it's going to be
[43:28] a deceiving spirit acting like god
[43:33] that's still giving you what you really
[43:35] want in your carnal nature
[43:39] that's the deception
[43:42] that's why the seals had to be loosed is
[43:45] so that we can recognize that white
[43:47] horse when it comes
[43:50] we have to recognize the white horse or
[43:52] one big trouble
[43:54] but now that the seals have been loosed
[43:57] there is a people in the face of the
[43:59] earth that can recognize that slight
[44:02] deviation
[44:03] quickly
[44:04] we don't have to end up at the end of
[44:06] the pattern before we realize there's a
[44:08] problem
[44:10] i would venture to say that we're coming
[44:11] to the point in time as maturity is
[44:13] developing within the bride i believe
[44:16] that we are fighting the white horse
[44:18] more and more and more
[44:19] and this is a good thing
[44:21] because if we're fighting the white
[44:22] horse that means we're still in the
[44:24] front front lines
[44:25] and he hasn't breached
[44:27] we're not on the red horse we're not on
[44:29] the black horse thank god we can't end
[44:31] up on the pale horse by his
[44:32] predestination
[44:35] but just because you're dealing with the
[44:36] white horse on a daily basis does not
[44:38] make you a bad person i would venture to
[44:40] say it makes you a good person because
[44:42] at least you're not on the red horse or
[44:43] on the black horse so you're going to be
[44:45] fighting a battle
[44:47] that's not the issue
[44:49] the issue is when you let the white
[44:51] horse in when you let that deceiving
[44:53] spirit acting like god
[44:56] deceive you away from the true word from
[44:58] he whom he hath sent
[45:03] so now that we recognize
[45:05] how this spirit is to come
[45:07] we have the ability to combat it
[45:10] without the seals being loosed
[45:12] remember we we have
[45:14] thousands of years of church history
[45:18] thousands of years of church history
[45:20] of how they fell and why they fell
[45:26] but now that we have that loosed we
[45:28] don't have to repeat that that's the
[45:30] only difference between us and the other
[45:31] church ages saints
[45:33] but brother branham we know this
[45:35] scripturally this had to be done at the
[45:37] end time because there had to be a
[45:38] people in the face of the earth that
[45:40] would not take his bait that would not
[45:42] fail and the only way for us not to fail
[45:45] is to know his tactics
[45:49] he says you met a deceiving spirit and
[45:52] the world is full of it today
[45:58] thank god we have a word to recognize a
[46:00] deceiving spirit
[46:03] continuing further down in this quote
[46:06] he says now that quickening power that
[46:07] came upon jesus quickened him to
[46:09] manifest every promise
[46:11] of the word of that day
[46:14] so does the holy spirit that come upon
[46:16] us in this day if it's not a mockery
[46:20] holy spirit
[46:22] and again as i expounded upon this last
[46:24] time this is
[46:25] so profound to me
[46:29] the terminology that he would come and
[46:31] he would use
[46:33] describing this enemy and describing
[46:35] this tactic of a mockery
[46:38] holy spirit
[46:41] something that is impersonating a spirit
[46:44] so well that it would even take the same
[46:46] title of the holy spirit but it would be
[46:49] a mockery
[46:50] holy spirit
[46:52] again this is
[46:54] this is a honed razor's edge
[46:57] and this is the battle that we fight
[47:00] within ourselves
[47:02] between our soul and our spirit realm
[47:05] and the only way that we're going to
[47:07] overcome that
[47:08] is to allow the word to discern between
[47:11] the soul and the spirit
[47:13] to believe on whom he hath sent and
[47:16] allow he whom he has spent sent to
[47:19] discern between our soul and our spirit
[47:22] and that takes something as as the old
[47:24] saying is to just being honest with
[47:26] ourself
[47:27] because again this is this we're living
[47:29] in in a day and an age that we have the
[47:32] capability to deceive and to fool those
[47:35] that are around us
[47:38] we just have to acknowledge that we have
[47:39] to accept that it is what it is but
[47:42] that's not my concern
[47:44] my concern and brother branham said all
[47:46] hell
[47:48] is against the revelation
[47:50] to the individual
[47:52] it's not about
[47:54] you understand what i'm saying here it's
[47:56] not i'm not doing away with the local
[47:57] church body but it's not about the local
[47:59] church body and what it's projecting
[48:02] or even what your neighbor is projecting
[48:04] it is about knowing beyond a shadow of
[48:06] doubt on your soul
[48:09] where you're at and being honest with
[48:12] yourself allowing he the spirit of truth
[48:16] to come and discern your life
[48:20] because if not
[48:22] we're going to end up with a mockery
[48:24] holy spirit
[48:26] something that's taking
[48:27] most probably most of the word
[48:30] but still disregarding part of it
[48:33] he says but is the if it's the real true
[48:36] holy spirit it will manifest the promise
[48:38] of this hour
[48:40] the promise of this hour is a full
[48:42] manifestation of the word
[48:45] i'll just make that real simple
[48:47] don't get confused in what the promise
[48:48] of the hour is the promise of the hour
[48:51] is a full manifestation in bright form
[48:55] the promise of the hour is a full
[48:57] manifestation of the unadulterated word
[49:00] of god without your interpretation or
[49:02] without your deviation being manifested
[49:05] through your being
[49:06] brother branham gave all types of terms
[49:08] to this age he called it a bride age an
[49:10] astronaut age but i think he called it
[49:12] an abrahamic age
[49:14] but i think my favorite description was
[49:17] he come and he says this is a free age
[49:20] this is a free age we are free to live
[49:25] a life and a manifestation without
[49:28] compromise we have the capability and
[49:31] the power to do that because satan's
[49:33] tactics have been exposed and we have
[49:35] had a true word and a wave sheath set
[49:38] before us
[49:40] we do not have to compromise and settle
[49:43] for a mockery holy spirit
[49:45] or a partial
[49:47] manifestation of the word
[49:54] okay that's where we ended up last time
[49:56] so
[49:58] this is all new stuff now
[50:00] i know you're excited
[50:03] 1965 god's power to transform we just
[50:06] listened to this
[50:08] but brother branham says
[50:09] speaking of cain he says remember he
[50:11] thought of god he worshipped god
[50:14] he had a church he built an altar he
[50:17] made a sacrifice he prayed he worshiped
[50:21] were any of those bad
[50:24] were any of those different than what we
[50:26] do
[50:27] not a bit
[50:30] but he
[50:31] was rejected
[50:34] religion see
[50:36] that is satan's business
[50:39] so now couple this with
[50:41] the quotes that we just read of a
[50:43] mockery holy spirit and a deceiving
[50:47] spirit acting like god
[50:48] now he comes at the very end of his
[50:50] ministry and he says that
[50:52] religion
[50:54] which could be defined as a mockery holy
[50:56] spirit
[50:58] a false comforter that's what religion
[51:00] is
[51:02] he says that is satan's business
[51:06] that was his business in the beginning
[51:08] that is his business now
[51:11] brother brandon says it's not the people
[51:13] out there in the bar rooms and on the
[51:14] street
[51:15] and out there in the world that's going
[51:16] to be disappointed on that day
[51:19] he says it's going to be the people who
[51:20] thought they were right
[51:26] satan's
[51:28] business
[51:30] is religion
[51:32] giving you
[51:33] a false comforter
[51:35] that's his business
[51:37] that's what he wants to do to you each
[51:39] and every day
[51:42] he says
[51:43] not to kill the whole thing
[51:47] not to destroy the whole message
[51:51] he's not going to set himself up for
[51:52] failure he knows he can't do that
[51:55] he can't kill the whole thing
[51:57] but what he can do is make it his
[52:00] business to pervert it
[52:02] and to pervert it on the individual
[52:04] level
[52:06] that's his business
[52:07] not to kill the whole thing he says all
[52:10] no not communist
[52:12] no no the antichrist is not communism
[52:15] the bible said it would deceive the very
[52:18] elected if it was possible
[52:20] don't notice the iron curtain but the
[52:22] purple one meaning the religious one
[52:25] notice cain came to worship but he had
[52:28] the wrong seed in him serpent seed the
[52:32] hiss of the serpent had hissed over him
[52:33] for he was the seed of the woman
[52:35] he watched this carefully he knew the
[52:39] perfect will of god
[52:42] but he refused to do it
[52:45] you say that bad bad bad person
[52:49] that's the battle we face each and every
[52:51] day
[52:53] god
[52:54] has sent us a voice
[52:56] to reveal the remember his will is his
[52:58] word and has revealed the perfect word
[53:02] and the perfect will of god to us
[53:06] if we deviate away from that we've done
[53:08] the same thing cain has done
[53:13] so we can make it as far off as we want
[53:15] it to be but it's really not
[53:17] and like i said before i'm not
[53:18] interested in far off i'm interested in
[53:20] right here
[53:23] because
[53:24] this flesh is still hybrid just like
[53:25] yours is
[53:27] it still has serpent seed mixed in with
[53:29] it
[53:32] understand
[53:33] so we're going to fight the same thing
[53:35] that that cain fought
[53:36] the spirit that that cain was dealing
[53:39] with is the same spirit we have to fight
[53:42] and what was that
[53:44] the true word of god came to him
[53:47] and he refused it
[53:49] now thank god we're elect we're
[53:50] predestinated that we will eventually
[53:52] get it right and i believe that with all
[53:54] my heart
[53:55] i believe we are predestinated to get it
[53:57] right the bride of jesus christ is
[53:58] predestinated and quite frankly as
[54:01] brother branham said later in this
[54:02] message that's the only that's the only
[54:03] reason we're going to get it right
[54:05] because if we were left in the condition
[54:07] that we were that we're in we're going
[54:09] to get it wrong
[54:10] that's the whole point of him sending us
[54:12] a voice to free us from that
[54:14] he said he knew the perfect will of god
[54:16] but he refused to do it
[54:20] that is the battle saints
[54:22] that is the battle did you know that
[54:25] satan
[54:26] knows the will of god
[54:28] but just refuses to do it
[54:32] so again
[54:34] we come to these parallel tracks
[54:37] and we come to these contrasts so if
[54:40] a spirit acting like god that isn't god
[54:43] and a mockery holy spirit and a
[54:45] religious spirit
[54:47] knows the true word of god but fails and
[54:50] refuses to do it
[54:52] and we're not wanting a mockery holy
[54:54] spirit or a deceiving spirit or a
[54:56] religious spirit we're wanting the true
[54:59] person of the holy spirit what should we
[55:01] then do to get it
[55:04] elementary i know but that's really how
[55:07] simple it is
[55:08] receive the true word of god which is
[55:10] his will and don't refuse it yield to it
[55:15] the key to all of this
[55:19] is die to yourself
[55:23] the key to all of this we like i said we
[55:26] can use thousands and tens of thousands
[55:28] of words and no doubt we'll continue to
[55:31] do that but really at the end of the day
[55:33] it's that simple
[55:34] to die to ourself
[55:37] let the word
[55:38] from he whom he hath sent
[55:40] expose
[55:42] the fallacies in our life and die to
[55:44] that
[55:46] by default you will receive the spirit
[55:47] of truth
[55:50] but you must die to yourself because
[55:52] that is what cain failed to do that is
[55:54] what satan failed to do even in heaven
[55:56] remember that's where the battle started
[55:58] that's what satan failed to do he
[55:59] refused to die to himself
[56:02] cain just manifested that in a fleshly
[56:04] form
[56:06] that spirit has continued to manifest
[56:07] itself
[56:09] all the way down through time until we
[56:10] come to the last age
[56:13] at the very closing moments of time and
[56:15] now there's a people in the face of the
[56:17] earth
[56:18] who has heard the true will and word of
[56:20] god
[56:22] and refuses to compromise on that
[56:25] but dies to themself
[56:27] and allows a free age to be manifested
[56:29] through themselves
[56:30] a free age
[56:32] the word is free to manifest itself
[56:37] so this mockery holy spirit that brother
[56:39] branham is speaking about remember this
[56:42] may not be something written down as a
[56:45] creed in a denominational church
[56:47] somewhere or even in a message church
[56:49] somewhere
[56:52] let's not be so naive to think that
[56:54] there aren't message churches who have
[56:55] an unwritten creed
[56:57] like this is what we believe and if you
[56:58] don't like it there's the door
[57:00] we understand there's i mean there's
[57:02] been decades of doctrines and ministries
[57:05] and people and followings um
[57:07] you know we're not children anymore
[57:08] let's just call it for what it is there
[57:10] there have there have been deviations
[57:12] away from the message
[57:14] i hope that's not shocking to anybody
[57:16] but we understand that when brother
[57:18] branham is talking about this mockery
[57:19] holy spirit this may not be a written
[57:22] creed in
[57:24] in
[57:25] against the written word of god
[57:27] somewhere
[57:28] this may simply be a spirit
[57:31] that somebody has received and is
[57:33] projecting
[57:34] that you have received and are
[57:36] projecting
[57:38] and that that can be your creed a creed
[57:42] is something that you're living by
[57:44] it can be your own creed you may be a
[57:46] one-man denomination
[57:50] that's why we have to have the voice
[57:53] because only the voice can come and
[57:55] expose those things
[57:58] and the greatest battle ever fought
[58:00] brother random says
[58:01] now what did satan do satan had the
[58:03] others anointing now satan anoints his
[58:05] servants
[58:06] what does he anoint them with with
[58:08] unbelief satan and his demons anoints
[58:11] humanity to disbelieve god's word
[58:16] i don't think that needs expounded
[58:17] opponent
[58:19] now if you want to confirm that you turn
[58:21] to genesis 3 4. that's the first thing
[58:24] he did
[58:25] he never leaves his same tactic
[58:31] he does it
[58:32] all the time
[58:35] again this is why the seals had to be
[58:37] loosed because now that we know his
[58:39] tactics we know he's not going to change
[58:41] that we know how to combat him we now we
[58:43] know how to overcome him
[58:45] he says he does it all the time
[58:49] now he didn't
[58:51] disagree with the word
[58:55] he's exposing the tactic now catch it
[58:58] he didn't disagree with the word
[59:02] he just caused her
[59:04] to kind of misconstrue it a little bit
[59:07] you know just kind of make it sound like
[59:10] the way he wanted it to sound
[59:12] don't take the whole word
[59:18] this is the mockery holy spirit
[59:21] this is a spirit acting like god
[59:24] that's trying to deceive the individual
[59:27] and he's doing it brother branham said
[59:29] all of the time
[59:31] back then
[59:33] and now
[59:36] the deception here
[59:38] brother brandon says the deception is to
[59:41] make people believe they're saved when
[59:43] they're not
[59:44] now i want to
[59:46] pre-qualify the terminology of saved
[59:48] when i'm speaking of saved i'm speaking
[59:51] of that from the revelation that we have
[59:52] of what saved means
[59:54] we know we were saved before the
[59:56] foundation of the world but in the
[59:57] christian world uh there is that term
[1:00:00] being saved when i'm speaking of saved
[1:00:02] i'm speaking of the new birth
[1:00:04] you dying and the word having the effect
[1:00:06] total effect receiving he the spirit of
[1:00:09] truth um the token the comforter so when
[1:00:12] i'm saying saved i'm not saying that in
[1:00:14] a generic form of yes i recognize jesus
[1:00:16] christ was the son of god he died on a
[1:00:18] cross and bled and died for me
[1:00:20] hallelujah i'm saved
[1:00:22] that's not what i'm referring to what
[1:00:24] i'm referring to is being saved truly
[1:00:28] recognizing that that was the word that
[1:00:29] bled and died for me and if i don't
[1:00:31] accept the word for my age i'm not
[1:00:33] accepting that word
[1:00:35] but because i accept this word for my
[1:00:38] age
[1:00:38] i also accept that word that died on the
[1:00:40] cross for me
[1:00:42] you can't have one without the other
[1:00:45] so
[1:00:46] if we receive the true word for our age
[1:00:49] we've died to ourself when we have
[1:00:51] allowed the true word for our age to
[1:00:53] come into our being
[1:00:55] we are saved
[1:00:57] we have been saved and we are currently
[1:00:59] saved and we're going to be saved in the
[1:01:01] future
[1:01:02] we have the token we have the new birth
[1:01:05] so that's what i'm referring to when i
[1:01:07] say saved but brother branham says the
[1:01:09] deception is for satan to come and to
[1:01:11] make you feel that you are saved when
[1:01:14] you're not he says that is the deception
[1:01:16] of this age and remember that is going
[1:01:18] to come through the religious ranks
[1:01:20] because that is where satan does his
[1:01:21] business at
[1:01:22] so satan is going to come into the
[1:01:24] religious ranks he is going to come into
[1:01:26] what we would say the ranks of the
[1:01:27] message and he is going to preach a
[1:01:29] gospel
[1:01:30] he is going to preach a message
[1:01:32] with a slight deviation that will still
[1:01:34] make you believe that you are saved
[1:01:37] and he is trying to comfort you with
[1:01:38] that
[1:01:44] satan's deception is to make you believe
[1:01:48] that you are saved when you're not
[1:01:54] the only other tactic that he has
[1:01:59] the only other tactic that he has
[1:02:03] is if you really are saved
[1:02:06] to make you believe you're not
[1:02:11] that's his two tactics
[1:02:13] he is going to convince you that you are
[1:02:16] saved when you're really not
[1:02:19] or
[1:02:20] if you really are
[1:02:22] he's going to try to convince you you're
[1:02:24] not
[1:02:25] because he knows if you have that proper
[1:02:27] understanding and you have the
[1:02:29] indwelling comforter he is powerless
[1:02:31] before you because the scripture says if
[1:02:33] my heart does not condemn me nothing can
[1:02:35] stand in my way
[1:02:39] so because religious is his business
[1:02:43] that's the only thing that he has
[1:02:45] i got to convince you you're saved
[1:02:46] before you really do get saved but if by
[1:02:48] for chance you do get saved before i
[1:02:50] convince you you're not saved i have to
[1:02:51] make you believe that you're not saved
[1:02:53] when you really are saved
[1:02:56] that is his business
[1:02:58] and that is what takes the comforter
[1:03:01] away from us
[1:03:03] that is why the seals had to be loosed
[1:03:06] that is why we had to have a vindicated
[1:03:09] prophet come and tell us what is right
[1:03:12] and what is wrong and that is why we
[1:03:14] have to die to any of our own thinking
[1:03:18] and strictly
[1:03:20] legalistically
[1:03:22] militantly
[1:03:24] take what he said is truth
[1:03:27] because anything else
[1:03:31] is going to leave us running around the
[1:03:33] cow shed
[1:03:36] anything else
[1:03:38] is going to bring us down
[1:03:42] from our proper position anything else
[1:03:45] is going to bring condemnation into our
[1:03:47] heart
[1:03:49] remember religion is satan's business
[1:03:52] you're not going to beat him at it
[1:03:55] you are not going to beat satan at
[1:03:58] religion
[1:03:59] it is his business and he has spent
[1:04:02] thousands and thousands and thousands of
[1:04:04] years just in this dimension mastering
[1:04:06] it let alone what he did in the other
[1:04:08] dimension
[1:04:10] you are not going to beat him with your
[1:04:13] mental prowess
[1:04:17] we have one chance saints
[1:04:19] we have one hope
[1:04:23] and that is to take what the voice said
[1:04:24] to us and if he said
[1:04:29] that the evidence of receiving god in
[1:04:32] your being
[1:04:34] is to believe
[1:04:35] on him who he hath sent
[1:04:38] and yield completely to that word
[1:04:41] that is the one and only evidence
[1:04:43] and you have done that
[1:04:45] do not allow satan to talk you out of it
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] do not allow him to talk you out of what
[1:04:52] you have received
[1:04:54] and furthermore be honest with yourself
[1:04:58] you're not going to gain anything by
[1:05:00] fooling me or your brother and sister or
[1:05:02] yourself
[1:05:03] if you haven't died out completely to
[1:05:05] that word do it
[1:05:07] so don't try to convince yourself you're
[1:05:10] saved if you haven't died out to the
[1:05:11] complete word of god if you haven't
[1:05:13] repent or perish
[1:05:16] but if you have do not let him back you
[1:05:19] down on that
[1:05:22] that is not the age that we live in we
[1:05:24] live in an age to where we must know who
[1:05:27] we are
[1:05:29] because if we do not know who we are and
[1:05:31] what we have received we stand no chance
[1:05:33] of changing dimensions
[1:05:36] if we are not steadfast in our belief of
[1:05:39] what we are here and now how do we think
[1:05:42] we're going to have rapturing faith to
[1:05:44] project us into another dimension
[1:05:46] you get there brother branham says it
[1:05:48] does not change anything you take what
[1:05:50] you are with you if you're a hot head
[1:05:53] here you'll be a hot haired head there
[1:05:56] what makes you think that we can stand
[1:05:57] here as a wishy-washy not knowing
[1:05:59] whether we're the bride of jesus christ
[1:06:01] and then suddenly change dimensions and
[1:06:03] be like oh yes i'm the bride of jesus
[1:06:04] christ no
[1:06:06] you're going to have to know that
[1:06:08] beforehand
[1:06:10] it's not going to
[1:06:12] it's not going to change when you get to
[1:06:13] that dimension because you're not going
[1:06:14] to get to that dimension
[1:06:19] and i can say that with an understanding
[1:06:21] that it's not changing whether you're
[1:06:22] bright or not
[1:06:25] you can be standing here and that
[1:06:26] applies to you and your bride
[1:06:29] but what i can say is we're not changing
[1:06:32] this dimension until all of us brian
[1:06:34] members come to that perfect revelation
[1:06:36] so you're going to come to it if your
[1:06:38] bride you're going to come to that i'm
[1:06:40] not preaching this is like you might
[1:06:42] miss it
[1:06:44] you're not going to miss it
[1:06:46] you're going to catch that revelation
[1:06:48] but i would say do that tonight
[1:06:50] do that here do that now don't wait be
[1:06:53] honest with yourself look inside allow
[1:06:56] the word to come and discern between
[1:06:57] your spirit and your soul and really
[1:07:00] really get real with god and say have i
[1:07:03] completely died out to my own thinking
[1:07:05] in my own ways and am i solely resting
[1:07:07] on the voice
[1:07:09] your voice
[1:07:11] he
[1:07:12] the spirit of truth
[1:07:16] and if you're not
[1:07:19] you're on treacherous ground
[1:07:22] because his rod and his staff is on the
[1:07:24] way
[1:07:25] but if you are
[1:07:27] allow that rod and that staff to be a
[1:07:29] comfort to you
[1:07:33] brother branham says we have the devil's
[1:07:36] answer
[1:07:37] and i want to declare that tonight that
[1:07:39] we have the devil's answer we do not
[1:07:41] have to be pushed to and fro we do not
[1:07:44] have to be unsettled we do not have to
[1:07:46] be unstable we do not have to have a
[1:07:49] nervous tension dictate our life
[1:07:51] we have the devil's answer of whether i
[1:07:54] am right with god or not
[1:07:55] farther more we have the devil's answer
[1:07:57] of whether god is in me or not
[1:08:00] god is his word and if i have died to
[1:08:03] myself and i am living by his word
[1:08:05] brother branham said in the church age
[1:08:07] book would not a life being manifested
[1:08:10] by the word be the word
[1:08:16] if you are manifesting the word
[1:08:20] there's only one way you can do that
[1:08:23] and that is if you are the word
[1:08:25] so this is not a message to
[1:08:28] put somebody in or take somebody out i
[1:08:30] don't have the power to do that i wish i
[1:08:32] did
[1:08:35] but i don't he alone has that
[1:08:39] but he has sent a word to make us
[1:08:41] recognize
[1:08:42] who we are and what we have
[1:08:45] and i just and i'm just you know i've
[1:08:47] been myself tonight i hope that's okay
[1:08:49] but i just i just don't like it
[1:08:52] i don't like it when i see a people
[1:08:55] who has the answer to something be
[1:08:57] pushed about i don't i don't want to be
[1:08:59] wishy-washy myself and i don't want to
[1:09:01] be i don't want to be around people that
[1:09:03] are wishy-washy i want to be a part of a
[1:09:05] local body who knows who they are
[1:09:08] and does not have to back up on that and
[1:09:11] again we are not preaching sinless
[1:09:12] perfection i'm talking when i say a body
[1:09:15] who knows who they are there is nothing
[1:09:17] wrong with recognizing that i'm somebody
[1:09:19] who made a mistake this morning
[1:09:20] but i repented of it and i made it right
[1:09:22] and now i am manifesting the word we get
[1:09:25] so so many people get confused oh lord
[1:09:27] have mercy help me we there's this
[1:09:29] saying that drives me nuts
[1:09:32] when they talk about brother branham
[1:09:34] they say well the word that he brought
[1:09:36] is my absolute but the man's not my
[1:09:38] absolute
[1:09:40] drives me nuts
[1:09:42] because this was a man i will remind you
[1:09:45] that god asked him to walk with him and
[1:09:48] changed his atoms
[1:09:51] as the wave sheath
[1:09:54] that what brought him to this atom
[1:09:56] changing is the same faith that's going
[1:09:58] to bring me to my atom changing
[1:10:00] so you when you can come and properly
[1:10:03] divide to me what part was the man and
[1:10:05] what part was the word then i'm okay
[1:10:06] with that saying but until you can
[1:10:08] divide to me what part was the word and
[1:10:10] what part was the man i'm going to say
[1:10:12] that brother william branham was my
[1:10:13] absolute
[1:10:14] and the word that was in him literally
[1:10:16] changed his body
[1:10:18] i'm okay with that
[1:10:20] now don't think that i'm so naive that
[1:10:21] i'm saying he didn't make mistakes
[1:10:23] because he did
[1:10:25] but allow me to say this
[1:10:28] is not repentance
[1:10:30] part of the word
[1:10:36] so if he made a mistake and he's
[1:10:38] repenting and he makes that right is he
[1:10:41] still not manifesting the true word
[1:10:46] now what would be a problem
[1:10:49] is if he made a mistake or he willfully
[1:10:52] send
[1:10:53] and he willfully did something wrong and
[1:10:55] he did not repent and line that up with
[1:10:58] the word
[1:10:59] but this was a voice that was so clear
[1:11:01] and this was a wave sheep and a
[1:11:02] manifestation that was so clear not only
[1:11:05] would he do it
[1:11:07] and go and make it right and continue
[1:11:09] manifesting the word but he would come
[1:11:12] and declare it from behind the pulpit
[1:11:20] and if i'm wrong when that god have
[1:11:21] mercy on me but i don't feel that i am
[1:11:23] praise god
[1:11:25] i have no problem saying that he
[1:11:29] brother william branham was my absolute
[1:11:31] because he
[1:11:32] he manifested the whole word
[1:11:37] repent i'll say it again repentance
[1:11:40] and recognizing you're wrong and did
[1:11:42] something wrong and made a mistake
[1:11:44] and correcting it and lining it up with
[1:11:46] the word
[1:11:47] that's still part of the word
[1:11:50] and it's only a problem and a deviation
[1:11:53] away from the word
[1:11:54] if you don't do that
[1:11:58] you know why i want that to be true and
[1:12:00] why i believe that's true is because i
[1:12:02] need that to be true
[1:12:06] not carnally spiritually
[1:12:09] because if that's not true for him
[1:12:12] i don't stand a chance
[1:12:15] because i made a mistake today probably
[1:12:18] more than i even know about and i'm
[1:12:20] probably going to make a mistake
[1:12:21] tomorrow
[1:12:22] but it does not change the fact that i
[1:12:24] have the capability to say look at the
[1:12:26] word and say that was wrong
[1:12:28] die to my own will go and make that
[1:12:31] right and keep manifesting the word
[1:12:35] the only other option that you have
[1:12:38] is to demonstrate sinless perfection in
[1:12:40] your flesh
[1:12:42] and if you can do that
[1:12:44] i'm perfectly fine with that
[1:12:46] but until somebody can demonstrate that
[1:12:49] to me i'm going to say that i'm
[1:12:51] comfortable
[1:12:52] with the voice that was declared through
[1:12:54] william branham and through even his
[1:12:56] hybrid flesh as being my absolute
[1:12:58] because it consistently and until his
[1:13:02] dying day and leaving this dimension
[1:13:05] subjected himself soul spirit and body
[1:13:09] to the word of god
[1:13:12] that is my goal
[1:13:14] and he did it
[1:13:16] why can that not be my absolute in the
[1:13:18] entire package
[1:13:20] repentance is part of the word
[1:13:23] and if it's manifested
[1:13:25] it's still the word manifesting now
[1:13:28] granted it's probably not not the most
[1:13:30] glorious manifestation that we want
[1:13:33] it's probably not the one that we're
[1:13:35] most comfortable with
[1:13:37] it's probably
[1:13:38] not the one that you want to brag about
[1:13:40] to your friends
[1:13:43] but just because you think i'm
[1:13:45] completely crazy
[1:13:46] i would remind you of what he said in
[1:13:48] the church age book
[1:13:50] of all of the things that brother
[1:13:52] branham said the last day bride's zeal
[1:13:54] could be
[1:13:57] he said the zeal
[1:13:58] of the last day bright would be to
[1:14:01] repent amen
[1:14:05] praise god
[1:14:07] so if you've come to sinless perfection
[1:14:09] and you don't need to repent anymore
[1:14:12] that probably means you're not part of
[1:14:13] the last day bride
[1:14:15] because you don't have brazil
[1:14:17] the zeal of the last day bride
[1:14:20] is to repent
[1:14:23] repent
[1:14:25] recognize there is a slight deviation of
[1:14:28] the word in my life and line it back up
[1:14:31] with the true word
[1:14:35] remember what it says in revelation
[1:14:36] chapter 5 5 we touched on that last
[1:14:38] service
[1:14:40] the root and offspring of david
[1:14:44] a man
[1:14:46] who'd done many many things wrong
[1:14:48] and would consistently say i am wrong
[1:14:51] the word is right
[1:14:53] help me to line up to that word
[1:14:58] we are not getting very far at all
[1:15:04] that's okay first john 3 8 he that
[1:15:06] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:15:08] devil sinneth from the beginning for
[1:15:09] this purpose the son of god was
[1:15:11] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:15:13] works of the devil
[1:15:15] i kind of got ahead of myself when i was
[1:15:17] talking about this but again this is why
[1:15:19] the seals had to be loosed
[1:15:22] the seals weren't just loose to reveal
[1:15:25] christ
[1:15:27] although it was just loose to reveal
[1:15:29] christ
[1:15:31] but christ being revealed was for one
[1:15:34] purpose per the scripture
[1:15:36] the son of god was manifested that he
[1:15:39] might destroy the works may i interject
[1:15:42] the tactics
[1:15:44] of the devil
[1:15:49] that's why he had to be manifest so that
[1:15:52] we could destroy
[1:15:53] the tactics of the devil
[1:15:57] brother rehner said in the church edge
[1:15:59] book when he was baptizing in jordan the
[1:16:01] word of god jesus came to him the word
[1:16:04] always comes to the truly spirit field
[1:16:10] the word
[1:16:11] always comes to the truly spirit field
[1:16:17] so if you think you're filled with a
[1:16:19] spirit you may be
[1:16:21] but if you want to check what spirit
[1:16:23] that is see if the word comes and backs
[1:16:25] up that spirit
[1:16:28] that is the evidence of being filled
[1:16:30] with the holy ghost
[1:16:32] did you notice that jesus said that the
[1:16:34] world could not receive the holy ghost
[1:16:37] well in this verse i just read neither
[1:16:39] could they receive the word
[1:16:43] i think i've
[1:16:45] beat that quite a bit that we get the
[1:16:47] point
[1:16:48] they were declaring
[1:16:51] that we have the holy spirit
[1:16:53] but they didn't have the word
[1:16:55] so jesus comes along and he says you
[1:16:57] can't accept my word therefore you do
[1:16:59] not have my spirit
[1:17:02] we cannot receive he
[1:17:05] the spirit of truth
[1:17:07] without receiving he
[1:17:09] the word
[1:17:11] that is the form that he has chose to
[1:17:13] come in and that is the form that we
[1:17:15] must accept him in
[1:17:16] and if we have accepted him in that form
[1:17:20] do not allow a spirit
[1:17:22] to deceive you out of what you have
[1:17:24] received
[1:17:27] be comfortable in it being as simple as
[1:17:29] what it really is
[1:17:31] i want you to note very carefully that
[1:17:33] jesus did not say that the evidence of
[1:17:35] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[1:17:37] speaking in tongues interpreting
[1:17:39] prophesying or shouting and dancing
[1:17:43] he said the evidence would be that you
[1:17:46] would be in the truth
[1:17:50] you would be in the word of god for your
[1:17:52] age
[1:17:55] evidence has to do with receiving the
[1:17:59] word
[1:18:03] tell me if i'm crazy but has not the
[1:18:05] religious world made it everything but
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:12] they have made it everything but that
[1:18:17] but let's come back to the simplicity of
[1:18:20] the gospel
[1:18:22] let's come back to the comforter
[1:18:25] because if we allow it to be everything
[1:18:27] that the religious world has made it
[1:18:32] you talk about a nervous tension
[1:18:35] you're never going to be settled you
[1:18:36] will never be steadfast
[1:18:39] your heart will never have peace
[1:18:42] but if and again that defies the whole
[1:18:45] purpose of the comforter
[1:18:48] so if the comforter that you have is not
[1:18:50] comforting you i would say that you have
[1:18:53] the wrong comforter
[1:18:55] and i would offer you the right
[1:18:56] comforter
[1:18:59] receiving
[1:19:00] the true word of god for your at your
[1:19:03] age
[1:19:04] from he whom he hath
[1:19:06] sent there is nothing else that will
[1:19:08] comfort you like that comfort saints
[1:19:11] there is nothing else that can bring
[1:19:12] that
[1:19:15] there is nothing else that has that
[1:19:16] capability
[1:19:19] but allow it to be as simple as what it
[1:19:21] is
[1:19:23] in first corinthians 14 37 it says if
[1:19:25] any man think himself to be a prophet or
[1:19:27] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:19:29] things that i write into you are the
[1:19:30] commandments of the lord now see that
[1:19:33] the proof of the indwelling spirit was
[1:19:35] to acknowledge
[1:19:37] and follow
[1:19:41] acknowledge
[1:19:43] and follow you all thought that i'd gone
[1:19:45] away from my legal legalistic side
[1:19:47] didn't you
[1:19:48] no no no it's not all grace it's not all
[1:19:51] grace
[1:19:52] to acknowledge
[1:19:54] and follow
[1:19:58] what god's prophet gave for his age as
[1:20:00] he set the church in order
[1:20:03] paul had to say those who claimed
[1:20:05] another revelation verse 36
[1:20:07] what
[1:20:08] came the word of god out from you
[1:20:11] or came it unto you only
[1:20:13] the evidence of a spirit-filled
[1:20:16] christian believer
[1:20:18] is not to produce the word of god
[1:20:24] we should take great comfort in that
[1:20:27] the evidence of a spirit-filled
[1:20:30] christian believer is not to produce the
[1:20:34] truth or word
[1:20:36] but to receive the truth
[1:20:39] word
[1:20:40] and to believe
[1:20:43] and obey it
[1:20:49] i'll say that with a stern voice
[1:20:51] to believe and obey it
[1:20:57] the bride of jesus christ is a very
[1:20:59] special class of people
[1:21:01] you can never make it too little too
[1:21:03] legalistic for the bride of jesus christ
[1:21:06] and you can never make it too much grace
[1:21:07] for the bride of jesus christ
[1:21:10] the bride of jesus christ is the only
[1:21:12] one that can receive a statement such as
[1:21:14] if you don't line up with the true word
[1:21:15] of god you're lost
[1:21:20] but if you line up with the true word of
[1:21:21] god you can't be lost
[1:21:23] but the bride of jesus christ don't have
[1:21:24] the capability to be lost so they're
[1:21:25] going to line up with the true word of
[1:21:27] god
[1:21:28] so you can preach it as tight as you
[1:21:30] need to preach it and they'll still line
[1:21:32] up or you can preach it as loose as what
[1:21:34] you want to preach it and they'll still
[1:21:35] line up
[1:21:37] it's a it's a very unusual class of
[1:21:39] people
[1:21:42] because it's the only class of people in
[1:21:44] the face of the earth that i can come
[1:21:45] and i can preach the gospel and i can
[1:21:47] say
[1:21:47] you go and do
[1:21:49] what you really want to do
[1:21:53] i give you complete liberty
[1:21:58] go and do what your heart's desirous
[1:22:03] and it'll work for the bride of jesus
[1:22:04] christ
[1:22:06] and then i can come over here and say
[1:22:09] don't do anything
[1:22:11] and check everything that you do and
[1:22:14] don't you dare deviate from one of the
[1:22:16] commandments of the word
[1:22:20] and they'll say amen to one and amen to
[1:22:22] the other
[1:22:24] because the bride of jesus christ has
[1:22:26] something in her heart that nobody else
[1:22:28] has
[1:22:29] and at the end of the end
[1:22:32] of the end
[1:22:33] of the end
[1:22:35] people are really going to do what they
[1:22:37] want to do anyhow
[1:22:39] so i can preach it tight
[1:22:42] i can preach it really tight
[1:22:46] and it's still not going to save you if
[1:22:47] you're unsavable
[1:22:50] and at the end of the day like i can
[1:22:51] preach it so tight that i can make you
[1:22:53] line up for months and months and months
[1:22:58] and then at the end of it you're still
[1:22:59] going to go do what you want to do
[1:23:00] anyhow
[1:23:01] like it might be the last 30 seconds of
[1:23:03] this
[1:23:04] of this earth but you're still going to
[1:23:05] go do what you want to do anyhow
[1:23:08] the bride of jesus christ is a peculiar
[1:23:11] person
[1:23:13] it's a
[1:23:15] very unique class
[1:23:20] bride of jesus christ as the prophet
[1:23:22] said
[1:23:24] her heart's desire is going to be to
[1:23:26] repent
[1:23:28] and line up to the true word of god
[1:23:32] it is such a unique thing saints
[1:23:34] repentance is such a unique thing
[1:23:37] the capability to repent should never be
[1:23:40] overlooked
[1:23:42] cain
[1:23:44] could not receive the revelation
[1:23:46] but god in his mercy came down and told
[1:23:49] him just do this
[1:23:53] and he could not die to himself repent
[1:23:56] and line up to that word
[1:23:59] the bride of jesus christ you can come
[1:24:03] and again preach it as hard as you can
[1:24:05] preach it
[1:24:06] and she will repent and line up to it
[1:24:09] i'll even go so far as to say that you
[1:24:11] can preach it so tight she won't even
[1:24:14] like it
[1:24:16] she won't even enjoy it
[1:24:18] she won't she won't even come and hear
[1:24:20] that minister again
[1:24:23] but she'll still line up to the word
[1:24:25] that he spoke
[1:24:26] it is a paradox
[1:24:28] it is a paradox
[1:24:30] but cain
[1:24:33] could not grasp the revelation and even
[1:24:35] when god would come and tell him
[1:24:36] verbatim he did not have the capability
[1:24:39] to repent
[1:24:41] but the bride of jesus christ does
[1:24:43] in whatever form that word comes along
[1:24:46] tight or loose legalistic or grace
[1:24:49] she will still
[1:24:51] find the word check herself by it and
[1:24:54] line up to it
[1:24:55] that is a unique capability
[1:25:00] if we are going to live as christians we
[1:25:03] have to have his spirit
[1:25:05] we're going to wrap this up so just stay
[1:25:07] with me
[1:25:08] it's 8 30 a little after
[1:25:11] just give me a couple more minutes okay
[1:25:13] we're not going to go long i know it's a
[1:25:14] wednesday night and i'm not going to get
[1:25:16] to the end so there's no need to even
[1:25:17] try so
[1:25:19] just go a little bit farther than we're
[1:25:20] going to close
[1:25:22] it says if we are going to live as
[1:25:23] christians we have to be in his spirit
[1:25:26] if there is anything good
[1:25:29] oh boy i shouldn't have just said that
[1:25:31] before i read this quote
[1:25:33] okay
[1:25:34] if there is anything good that will come
[1:25:37] to me
[1:25:38] it has to be
[1:25:40] listen to these three things that he
[1:25:42] says
[1:25:43] now the
[1:25:44] prerequisite to this
[1:25:46] is if anything good
[1:25:49] is to come my way
[1:25:52] it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:25:56] confirmed by the word
[1:25:58] and made manifest by the results it
[1:26:00] bears
[1:26:02] this this we have to get this
[1:26:05] this is foundational we have to get this
[1:26:08] brother branham says if we are going to
[1:26:09] live as christians we must live by his
[1:26:12] spirit and if there's anything good to
[1:26:14] come by my way meaning if god is going
[1:26:17] to bring anything good by my way it has
[1:26:19] to do three things it has to be revealed
[1:26:23] by the spirit
[1:26:29] what capability do you have to make the
[1:26:31] spirit reveal something to you
[1:26:34] i'll answer it for you none
[1:26:37] this is grace this is pure grace this is
[1:26:40] nothing but grace
[1:26:42] this is predestination at its finest
[1:26:45] in order for god to do anything good
[1:26:48] with you
[1:26:50] he has to bring his spirit by your way
[1:26:54] that's first and foremost you will never
[1:26:56] progress spiritually unless this happens
[1:27:00] unless something tumbles down through a
[1:27:02] mystical channel and lodges in your
[1:27:04] heart you don't have a chance
[1:27:07] this is the first thing
[1:27:09] it has to be revealed by the spirit this
[1:27:12] is true scripturally brother iran's not
[1:27:13] out left field remember the day of
[1:27:14] pentecost it says peter stood up and he
[1:27:16] preached the gospel and their hearts
[1:27:18] were pricked
[1:27:20] without their hearts being pricked they
[1:27:22] would not have stood around for anything
[1:27:24] else
[1:27:25] you tell me what capability that they
[1:27:27] had to prick their own heart
[1:27:30] none the spirit had to come by their way
[1:27:34] and the spirit's going to be riding on
[1:27:36] one thing
[1:27:37] the word
[1:27:39] when the word comes by your way it's the
[1:27:41] spirit coming by your way it's god
[1:27:42] coming by your way when you come around
[1:27:44] and you press player you hear a minister
[1:27:46] preach the unadulterated word of god
[1:27:48] that's god coming by your way
[1:27:50] don't take it for granted
[1:27:53] don't take it for granted
[1:27:55] let him come by your way in every form
[1:27:57] that he wants to come by your way the
[1:28:00] first thing that has to happen is the
[1:28:02] spirit has to reveal something to you
[1:28:05] he says then it has to be confirmed
[1:28:08] by the word
[1:28:11] that second
[1:28:12] you will never get away from that ever
[1:28:16] it has to be confirmed by your word
[1:28:18] because if a spirit comes by your way
[1:28:21] how are you going to discern whether it
[1:28:23] is a mockery holy spirit or a
[1:28:26] spirit acting like god
[1:28:30] a religious spirit unless you have
[1:28:33] something an absolute to check it by
[1:28:39] you're going to fail
[1:28:41] unless you take it back to he whom god
[1:28:45] hath sent
[1:28:47] that spirit can be any spirit
[1:28:51] it may be the right spirit
[1:28:54] but it may be the wrong spirit
[1:28:56] and there is only one way to properly
[1:28:58] discern it
[1:28:59] is allow he whom god hath sent to
[1:29:02] discern it for you that is the one and
[1:29:04] only way now when i'm preaching this i'm
[1:29:06] preaching this when as i said from a
[1:29:08] what we would term a salvation
[1:29:10] standpoint or as a spiritual maturing
[1:29:13] standpoint i'm not talking that if the
[1:29:15] spirit reveals to you
[1:29:18] don't go down this street tomorrow and
[1:29:20] make sure you go to work five minutes
[1:29:22] earlier i'm not talking about those what
[1:29:24] we would call very specific intimate um
[1:29:28] revealings of the spirit you understand
[1:29:30] what i'm saying because you say all of
[1:29:31] the spirit i just feel to go to work
[1:29:33] early tomorrow like there's an unction
[1:29:35] telling me
[1:29:36] i need to go early okay well then you
[1:29:38] read in the newspaper the next day the
[1:29:40] time that you would have been going
[1:29:40] through the intersect we we've all
[1:29:42] experienced this have we not we've all
[1:29:44] seen these that's not what i'm talking
[1:29:45] about because if you try to check that
[1:29:46] by the word you're going to be like i
[1:29:48] don't see anything in here about the
[1:29:49] intersection of elm and
[1:29:51] worth like
[1:29:53] can't be the word so i'm going to work
[1:29:54] right on time no that's not what i'm
[1:29:56] talking about
[1:29:57] brother branham says that god can do
[1:29:59] things outside of his word
[1:30:02] now he will never violate the principles
[1:30:05] of his word to do that
[1:30:07] never
[1:30:08] but when he's saying god can do things
[1:30:10] outside of his word meaning god can do
[1:30:13] things very specific for us on an
[1:30:15] individual level in our daily lives that
[1:30:17] you're not going to find a scripture or
[1:30:19] a quote for but that's not what i'm
[1:30:21] talking about i'm talking about what we
[1:30:23] would say foundational truths
[1:30:26] as re as relating to receiving the holy
[1:30:30] spirit the new birth and the token so
[1:30:32] everybody understand me where i'm coming
[1:30:34] from
[1:30:36] has to be revealed by the spirit it has
[1:30:38] to be confirmed by his word
[1:30:42] and remember the word is a person
[1:30:45] so when we're talking doctrine it's
[1:30:47] going to be confirmed by the written
[1:30:49] word
[1:30:50] when we're talking specifics in your
[1:30:52] life it has to line up with the nature
[1:30:54] of the word and the principles of the
[1:30:56] word so you can still check those things
[1:30:58] that come by your way
[1:31:00] like if something tells you to advance
[1:31:02] and invest all your money in this
[1:31:05] i would be checking that by the nature
[1:31:06] of the world
[1:31:07] the word
[1:31:08] not the world by the word so if it's
[1:31:11] telling you to invest all your money in
[1:31:12] marijuana grow operations i would
[1:31:14] probably check that by the nature of the
[1:31:15] word
[1:31:18] you understand it works both ways
[1:31:21] so just because you can't find a
[1:31:23] scripture it says don't invest in drug
[1:31:24] operations don't
[1:31:27] don't think you're ever going to get
[1:31:28] away from the nature of the word
[1:31:30] but as we're speaking doctrine it has to
[1:31:33] be confirmed by the word
[1:31:35] as interpreted by the prophet
[1:31:41] revealed by the spirit confirmed by the
[1:31:44] word
[1:31:45] and
[1:31:46] here comes my legalist legalistic side
[1:31:48] again
[1:31:49] made manifest by the results that it
[1:31:52] bears
[1:31:55] so
[1:31:56] if the results
[1:31:58] and the manifestation of your daily life
[1:32:03] is not one
[1:32:05] that matches the nature of the word
[1:32:07] the spirit of the word
[1:32:09] and the written word you do not have the
[1:32:12] holy ghost
[1:32:16] that's hard i know that's the truth
[1:32:19] somebody needs to hear it
[1:32:22] but if it does
[1:32:25] you cannot produce that which means you
[1:32:28] have the holy ghost
[1:32:32] you should take great comfort in that
[1:32:34] it's very very simple
[1:32:36] so let's back up a step
[1:32:37] if the manifestation of your daily life
[1:32:40] does not match the principles and the
[1:32:42] nature of the word
[1:32:44] the person of christ and his written
[1:32:47] word you do not have he the spirit of
[1:32:49] truth you do not have the token you do
[1:32:51] not have the holy ghost you do not have
[1:32:53] the new birth
[1:32:56] that would be a problem if you didn't
[1:32:58] have access to it
[1:33:00] but you do not have to walk out those
[1:33:02] doors tonight without it
[1:33:05] it's a very very simple process because
[1:33:08] god has given us a word and all that you
[1:33:11] have to do tonight to change that
[1:33:13] condition
[1:33:14] is be real
[1:33:16] and be honest
[1:33:18] and admit to god that you've been
[1:33:20] putting on a show for a long time
[1:33:22] and that you are tired of doing that and
[1:33:24] that you want the real goods
[1:33:26] and that you want the person of christ
[1:33:28] and from this night forward you are
[1:33:30] dying out to your own interpretation of
[1:33:33] the message and just taking it as he
[1:33:35] whom he had sent declared it
[1:33:40] that in itself
[1:33:42] gives you access to he the spirit of
[1:33:44] truth
[1:33:47] it is your choice
[1:33:49] if you walk out these doors without the
[1:33:51] new birth tonight
[1:33:53] you do not have to come here and fast
[1:33:54] you do not have to come here and pray
[1:33:56] you do not have to come here and cry you
[1:33:57] do not have to shout you do not have to
[1:33:59] jump you do not have to dance you do not
[1:34:01] have to do anything tonight
[1:34:04] other than admit that you are completely
[1:34:06] and utterly wrong
[1:34:09] and that he whom god hath sent is right
[1:34:12] and you take the word as he has declared
[1:34:18] that is the only requirement
[1:34:22] now that spirit will come right in
[1:34:23] behind you and say that right in behind
[1:34:25] that statement he'll say it's not that
[1:34:26] easy
[1:34:27] but let me expose that spirit for you
[1:34:30] because there was a great important
[1:34:32] person that came to the prophet one time
[1:34:34] and he says i need healing in my body
[1:34:36] he says okay just go jump in the river
[1:34:38] seven times you'll be fine
[1:34:41] it says on
[1:34:43] no no no it can't be that simple
[1:34:48] it can't be that simple just do what the
[1:34:50] prophet said do
[1:34:54] spirits don't die
[1:34:59] spirits don't die
[1:35:03] we have spent the religious world has
[1:35:06] spent thousands and thousands of years
[1:35:09] writing that spirit
[1:35:12] it can't be that simple just do what the
[1:35:15] prophet said do just go dunk seven times
[1:35:18] and i'll be fine
[1:35:20] it's the same spirit that wants to come
[1:35:22] to church tonight
[1:35:24] because religious religion is his
[1:35:26] business
[1:35:27] and tell you after that i just declared
[1:35:29] to you the only thing you have to do to
[1:35:31] have god indwelling in you is die to
[1:35:33] yourself and receive he the spirit of
[1:35:35] truth the words the truth as declared by
[1:35:39] the prophet of this
[1:35:40] age that will come along and say no it's
[1:35:43] not that easy
[1:35:45] he doesn't know my past
[1:35:49] he doesn't know where i really am at
[1:35:52] he doesn't know
[1:35:54] what's really going on with me
[1:35:57] and i will just admit i don't don't have
[1:35:59] a clue
[1:36:01] don't have a clue if god reveals
[1:36:03] something then that's that's one thing
[1:36:04] but standing here right now i don't have
[1:36:06] a clue
[1:36:07] i don't need to have a clue because he
[1:36:10] the spirit of truth does know
[1:36:14] and i'm preaching what paul preached
[1:36:16] and i'm preaching what brother branham
[1:36:17] preached and it's still good tonight
[1:36:20] if brother branham was standing here
[1:36:23] you would say he has the capability to
[1:36:25] look into my life and see what's going
[1:36:27] on
[1:36:29] and he could say those things
[1:36:31] but just because that gift of
[1:36:33] discernment is not here does not mean
[1:36:35] that the words that that gift that that
[1:36:37] voice spoke is not still accurate
[1:36:41] furthermore
[1:36:43] it shows signs of maturity in a people
[1:36:45] that they don't have to have that gift
[1:36:47] to declare those things and still
[1:36:48] recognize that what he said is truth
[1:36:50] because brother branham says that the
[1:36:51] point of all of those gifts was just to
[1:36:53] bring attention to the voice and make
[1:36:55] you god conscious to make you realize
[1:36:57] that he's here and that what he's saying
[1:36:59] is true
[1:37:04] i want to encourage you to allow it to
[1:37:06] be as simple as what it is
[1:37:09] and don't leave this building tonight
[1:37:11] washi washi
[1:37:13] you do not have to leave this building
[1:37:15] wondering
[1:37:16] you can come to an individual proper
[1:37:19] understanding whether or not you have
[1:37:21] completely died out to the voice that
[1:37:23] has been sent to you
[1:37:26] you have that capability if you are in
[1:37:28] your right mind tonight you have that
[1:37:30] capability to search your life to search
[1:37:33] your soul and be real with god
[1:37:36] and ask yourself that question
[1:37:39] am i still hanging on to my own ideas
[1:37:41] about something
[1:37:43] and i would venture to say that it's
[1:37:44] probably not what we would consider a
[1:37:46] dirty idea or a sinful idea it's sinful
[1:37:49] because it would be against the word but
[1:37:51] i'm not talking about schmutty dirty
[1:37:52] living
[1:37:54] i'm talking about a slight deviation
[1:37:56] away from the word to still hold on to
[1:37:58] something that you want check yourself
[1:38:01] check yourself
[1:38:02] it really is that simple and if that is
[1:38:04] the case i would just encourage you to
[1:38:07] manifest the word
[1:38:10] repent
[1:38:12] make it right
[1:38:14] and believe on the word yield to the
[1:38:16] word
[1:38:18] receive he the spirit of truth tonight
[1:38:22] again it is by your own choice if you
[1:38:25] walk out those doors without the holy
[1:38:26] spirit the religious world will tell you
[1:38:28] it's a seven days process it's a ten day
[1:38:31] process it's a fast and a prey and a
[1:38:33] slobber and whatever else and i'm not
[1:38:34] against any of that
[1:38:36] it may be that way but it doesn't have
[1:38:39] to be that way
[1:38:42] death to self
[1:38:45] entitles you to the token
[1:38:48] that is the only requirement
[1:38:50] you cannot get around it
[1:38:52] there's no wiggle room with it like
[1:38:54] there's only one requirement but like it
[1:38:56] is a requirement like there's no wiggle
[1:38:58] room musicians please come
[1:39:01] there's no wiggle room with it
[1:39:04] you're not going to get around it
[1:39:06] but if you meet that requirement
[1:39:10] allow it to stand for what it stands for
[1:39:13] and allow the results to be what the
[1:39:16] results what the scripture says god
[1:39:19] himself says if you will do this
[1:39:22] i promise i will do this
[1:39:24] that is his promise and now we have a
[1:39:26] prophet come on the scene and says that
[1:39:28] he wants to do his part more than what
[1:39:30] you want him to
[1:39:33] but you have to die to yourself
[1:39:35] you have to do the one thing that cain
[1:39:37] wasn't able to do
[1:39:39] you have to do the one thing that that
[1:39:41] mockery holy spirit does not want you to
[1:39:43] do
[1:39:44] die to yourself
[1:39:49] if we are going to live as christians we
[1:39:51] have to be in his spirit
[1:39:53] if there is anything good that will come
[1:39:55] to me
[1:39:56] it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:40:00] confirmed by the word
[1:40:02] and made manifest by the results that it
[1:40:04] bears
[1:40:07] you don't have to worry about this
[1:40:09] spirit producing the life
[1:40:12] it's going to produce or you're going to
[1:40:14] blow up
[1:40:17] this is the life of god you think the
[1:40:20] life of god is going to come into your
[1:40:22] being and not produce itself
[1:40:26] not a chance
[1:40:28] it will produce itself
[1:40:31] it will manifest itself in diverse ways
[1:40:35] but don't try to make your manifestation
[1:40:37] match somebody else's manifestation
[1:40:40] because then what you've done is you've
[1:40:41] made them your absolute instead of the
[1:40:43] word you're absolute their manifestation
[1:40:45] may be right but it does not have to be
[1:40:47] your manifestation
[1:40:49] all of our manifestations have to be
[1:40:53] believing
[1:40:54] on he whom he had sent
[1:40:56] and dying to ourselves does that make
[1:40:58] sense to everybody is everybody on the
[1:41:00] same page
[1:41:01] did i preach it too hard did i preach it
[1:41:03] too soft
[1:41:04] comments questions
[1:41:06] i want to go one step farther here and
[1:41:08] then we're going to sing i promise
[1:41:14] the holy spirit
[1:41:18] as defined by the scripture is he the
[1:41:20] spirit of truth
[1:41:22] that will reveal to you things which are
[1:41:25] remember the scripture says this
[1:41:27] to reveal to you
[1:41:28] things which are remember when peter
[1:41:31] received the holy spirit he stood up and
[1:41:32] he said this is that
[1:41:34] right
[1:41:35] so the holy spirit comes on the scene
[1:41:37] and it reveals to you this is that
[1:41:41] but the scripture also says it will re
[1:41:43] will reveal to you things that are to
[1:41:44] come
[1:41:46] so it doesn't just reveal this is that
[1:41:48] it reveals things to come
[1:41:50] now this is imperative
[1:41:52] to bring us to a settledness
[1:41:55] those of you that are sitting here who
[1:41:57] have received the holy spirit but are
[1:42:00] still unsettled here's your answer
[1:42:03] here's your answer
[1:42:05] because it is a working of the holy
[1:42:07] spirit
[1:42:10] the holy spirit
[1:42:12] works
[1:42:14] so it reveals to you things which are
[1:42:17] as in
[1:42:19] i'm a hopeless cause i need help
[1:42:22] i'm lost i need saved
[1:42:25] that is a working of the holy spirit
[1:42:28] right
[1:42:29] but that is not the end of the holy
[1:42:30] spirit and that's where people get
[1:42:32] confused because they'll accept that
[1:42:35] portion and repent and accept a savior
[1:42:38] and accept the word and then three days
[1:42:40] later they trip and they fall and they
[1:42:42] say
[1:42:44] i thought i had it but obviously i don't
[1:42:48] but the holy spirit is to reveal to you
[1:42:50] the problem and say this is that
[1:42:53] you're a sinner you need saved you're
[1:42:56] hopeless you need hope you're lost you
[1:42:58] need saved
[1:43:00] that is what's revealing things that are
[1:43:03] present tense
[1:43:05] but it does not stop there per the
[1:43:07] scriptures
[1:43:09] the scripture says it will continue to
[1:43:10] reveal to you things that are
[1:43:13] so now that you've received the true
[1:43:15] baptism of the holy spirit and the true
[1:43:17] birth allow it to be what it is but do
[1:43:20] not think for a second that it's not
[1:43:22] going to do what the scripture says that
[1:43:23] it's going to do and the scripture says
[1:43:25] it's going to continue to reveal to you
[1:43:27] things that are
[1:43:28] a lot of people think that's doctrinally
[1:43:30] speaking and that's prophetic speaking
[1:43:32] and it is but that's not what i'm
[1:43:33] concerned about because i can live
[1:43:35] without those things
[1:43:37] just don't freeze it up on me don't
[1:43:39] freeze up
[1:43:40] he says satan's not concerned about how
[1:43:42] right you are in your doctrine
[1:43:44] if you miss the life you're not going to
[1:43:45] come up anyhow will the doctrine be
[1:43:47] there absolutely
[1:43:49] but the life has to be there the spirit
[1:43:51] has to be there the new birth has to be
[1:43:53] there
[1:43:54] so i can on an individual basis function
[1:43:59] and be fine without those things because
[1:44:00] god will set gifts in the church to
[1:44:02] bring those things to me
[1:44:04] but as an individual i cannot progress
[1:44:07] without the new birth i have to have
[1:44:09] that
[1:44:10] but this holy spirit will continue to
[1:44:12] reveal things that are meaning
[1:44:17] you did this today
[1:44:18] and it doesn't line up with my word amen
[1:44:22] so now it does not do away with what the
[1:44:25] holy spirit revealed back here as in
[1:44:27] things that were
[1:44:29] you had a problem you needed fixed got
[1:44:32] that taken care of
[1:44:34] the scripture says he's not going to
[1:44:37] stop there
[1:44:39] he is going to continue to reveal to you
[1:44:42] things that will be
[1:44:44] meaning
[1:44:45] you will still have problems
[1:44:49] you will be
[1:44:50] in problems
[1:44:52] he will continue to reveal to you
[1:44:56] you are a problem
[1:45:02] i'm preaching what paul preached
[1:45:05] i beat myself black and blue daily
[1:45:09] i want to do right but i can't will
[1:45:11] somebody help me
[1:45:13] do you think for a second paul was not
[1:45:15] converted
[1:45:18] paul was converted
[1:45:20] but the holy spirit i know shocking was
[1:45:24] doing what the holy spirit said it would
[1:45:25] do in the scripture
[1:45:27] it continued to reveal to him
[1:45:31] his problems
[1:45:32] things that will be
[1:45:35] don't get those too confused
[1:45:38] allow there to be an experience
[1:45:41] allow there to be an experience of a new
[1:45:42] birth and allow it to be steadfast
[1:45:45] brother brandon referred to it as a thai
[1:45:46] post allow it to be concrete never
[1:45:50] deviating
[1:45:51] if you have that experience if you don't
[1:45:53] get it but if you have it don't deviate
[1:45:56] away from it and don't get confused by
[1:45:59] the working of the holy spirit you do
[1:46:02] not need to be reborn born again
[1:46:05] what you need to do is be borned again
[1:46:08] and allow the spirit to continue to
[1:46:10] reveal to you things that are
[1:46:13] the holy spirit does two three things it
[1:46:16] comes and it reveals to you you got a
[1:46:18] problem and you need to fix it
[1:46:21] you have to do that three things you
[1:46:24] have a problem and you need to fix it
[1:46:25] you have a problem you need to repent
[1:46:28] god cannot repent for you
[1:46:31] that is the only power that you have
[1:46:33] i promise we're closing after these
[1:46:35] three things
[1:46:38] you the only power you have is the power
[1:46:40] to repent
[1:46:42] that is the threefold manifestation of
[1:46:44] the holy spirit it comes to you and it
[1:46:46] reveals to you you have a problem you
[1:46:48] need to do something about it
[1:46:50] you have to repent now
[1:46:52] because we've been around the message
[1:46:54] and we have proper teaching with i would
[1:46:56] say within the ranks of the message
[1:46:59] we're privileged because when it comes
[1:47:01] and it does that it can also reveal to
[1:47:03] us things that are manifesting in our
[1:47:05] life that we need to lay down
[1:47:07] like we don't have to wonder whether
[1:47:08] it's right to smoke
[1:47:10] and if you're smoking quit it
[1:47:13] there are some people with their
[1:47:14] willpower they can receive that they can
[1:47:17] recognize its anti-word they can lay it
[1:47:19] down and stop that is the working of the
[1:47:21] first phase you got a problem fix it
[1:47:24] repent and his brother uh branham taught
[1:47:27] us there's things it's just our
[1:47:28] reasonable duty
[1:47:30] if it's wrong lay it down quit doing it
[1:47:33] start dressing right start acting right
[1:47:35] like don't ask the holy spirit to do
[1:47:36] something for you you can do yourself
[1:47:38] and you know to do
[1:47:39] you understand
[1:47:42] but now we come to the second phase and
[1:47:44] the second phase is you recognize you
[1:47:46] have a problem and you have no power to
[1:47:48] overcome it
[1:47:51] you still have the holy spirit
[1:47:54] this is simply another face
[1:47:57] he reveals to you the things that are
[1:47:58] you have a problem you need to fix it
[1:48:00] okay lord i have done all that i know to
[1:48:02] do and all that i can do but i still
[1:48:04] have this in my life and i cannot
[1:48:05] overcome it you are not lost you still
[1:48:08] have the holy spirit the holy spirit is
[1:48:09] now working
[1:48:11] so now what it does is you repent of
[1:48:13] that and you acknowledge the fact that
[1:48:14] you have no capability to make yourself
[1:48:16] right now he is released to do the
[1:48:19] second fold of the holy spirit
[1:48:21] he has come on the scene and he is going
[1:48:23] to fix and help you overcome what you
[1:48:26] know
[1:48:27] is wrong in your life
[1:48:29] but that's the second phase but now we
[1:48:32] come to the third phase
[1:48:34] and it's we're still born again we still
[1:48:37] have the token we still have he the
[1:48:38] spirit of truth but the third phase is
[1:48:40] where people get confused because the
[1:48:42] third phase is when he really comes and
[1:48:44] shows you things that are because now
[1:48:47] there are problems in your life that you
[1:48:49] don't even know about
[1:48:55] how can you repent of something when you
[1:48:57] don't even know there's a problem
[1:49:00] you say that's impossible oh no it's not
[1:49:03] no it's not because it's bred into us
[1:49:06] and a sea bolt has a really hard time
[1:49:08] seeing sea bolt problems
[1:49:14] it's all that a seabolt ever knows
[1:49:16] so if a seatbelt has problems
[1:49:20] looking and understanding what a
[1:49:22] seabolt's problem is who do you think is
[1:49:24] going to affect seabolt's problems
[1:49:27] holy spirit has to come on the scene and
[1:49:30] do what the holy spirit does reveal to
[1:49:33] you that things that are and will be
[1:49:36] uh the holy this is why your brother and
[1:49:39] your sister can come to you and be like
[1:49:40] hey have you ever thought about this
[1:49:42] like
[1:49:43] maybe that's not exactly right and
[1:49:45] you're like
[1:49:48] that's embarrassing
[1:49:52] not sure how i missed that one
[1:49:56] okay i'm the only one praise the lord
[1:50:01] your dna and hybridization is so strong
[1:50:04] it's blinding
[1:50:05] that is why iron sharpeneth iron and
[1:50:08] your brother and sister you all are i
[1:50:10] know you believe this
[1:50:12] because we do it all the time we look at
[1:50:14] each other we're like what is wrong with
[1:50:16] that guy like
[1:50:19] problem
[1:50:21] we can't see it saints a sibolt cannot
[1:50:24] see a seabolt's problem
[1:50:25] echola cannot see a coal ass problem i
[1:50:28] can go down the list if you want me to i
[1:50:30] have amazing discernment right now
[1:50:34] we cannot see our own problems therefore
[1:50:37] we by default are hopeless
[1:50:41] at the end of the day we can do what we
[1:50:44] know to do is right and it's filthy rags
[1:50:47] we can even acknowledge lord i got a
[1:50:48] problem and i can't overcome it and he
[1:50:50] can come and he can fix it for us but
[1:50:52] when we end up at that third phase the
[1:50:54] final phase of
[1:50:56] of perfection
[1:50:58] we have got to come and be real with god
[1:51:01] god i know i've got problems that i
[1:51:04] don't even know about
[1:51:06] you have got to come and reveal them to
[1:51:08] me so that i can make them right
[1:51:12] and when you come to that level
[1:51:14] don't think for a second that your your
[1:51:17] new birth went anywhere
[1:51:19] because if you ask him that question
[1:51:21] he's going to start revealing things to
[1:51:22] you and you're probably going to feel
[1:51:23] like he was never born again
[1:51:26] because when somebody comes along when a
[1:51:28] cola comes along and tells the sea ball
[1:51:30] to sibo's problem it's like yeah that's
[1:51:32] embarrassing i don't know how i missed
[1:51:33] that clearly i don't have the holy ghost
[1:51:37] that's how obvious and simple they'll be
[1:51:40] that's why we have to allow he the
[1:51:43] spirit of truth to continue to work to
[1:51:46] be steadfast steadfast
[1:51:48] in our experience don't deviate away
[1:51:51] from your experience
[1:51:53] if you don't have one get one
[1:51:55] if you're not born again die to yourself
[1:51:57] be born again
[1:51:59] but if you've been born again do not
[1:52:01] deviate away from that
[1:52:03] but allow him to continue to work
[1:52:06] let's sing amen
[1:52:11] please save me from myself
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:28] it's not

[1:52:36] that we find
[1:52:38] the strength
[1:52:41] [Music]

[1:53:44] have not had that true born again token
[1:53:47] experience

[1:53:50] would grant them that
[1:53:52] lord
[1:53:53] may there not be an individual walk out
[1:53:55] of these doors that have not completely
[1:53:57] died to themselves
[1:53:58] and given over to the truth as revealed
[1:54:01] by the voice that you have sent to us
[1:54:04] lord and as such if if we would do that
[1:54:06] part which is the only part we can do
[1:54:09] i pray that you would come and that you
[1:54:10] would fulfill your promise
[1:54:12] and that you would fill each and every

[1:54:48] you have done for us lord
[1:54:50] but at the same time may we move forward
[1:54:53] humbly
[1:54:54] knowing that if you don't come on the
[1:54:56] scene and continue to reveal things that
[1:54:58] are in our life that are wrong
[1:55:00] we have no ability to line them up with
[1:55:02] your word father may we submit ourselves
[1:55:06] completely to you to allow you to do
[1:55:10] what you need to do to bring this bride
