[0:00] now he goes back to the scripture only
[0:01] he he injects god so you know that he's
[0:04] talking about
[0:06] that letteth will let until he
[0:09] this is another he
[0:11] be taken out of the way
[0:13] so he that letteth
[0:15] which which means hinder or to hold back
[0:17] that's holding back this antichrist
[0:19] that's holding back amen all of all of
[0:21] the destruction that's coming upon the
[0:23] earth through the tribulation who's
[0:24] holding it back amen he
[0:27] will hold back we'll let
[0:29] he that now letteth will let until he be
[0:32] taken out of the way
[0:34] so there's two he's
[0:35] right
[0:36] he that now letteth will let until he be
[0:40] taken out of the way
[0:41] so he is somebody that's holding it back
[0:44] and he will hold it back until he's
[0:46] taken out of the way
[0:48] but listen to how brother branham
[0:49] describes these two he's
[0:53] he only he god
[0:55] that led us will let until he the church
[0:58] christ the bride
[1:01] be taken out of the way
[1:04] amen greater is he that is in you than
[1:06] he that's in the world amen he god
[1:09] that's holding it back will hold it back
[1:12] till he the church christ the bride be
[1:15] taken out of the way your presence is
[1:17] life amen your presence on this earth is
[1:20] holding a door open for the gentiles
[1:22] there is life the church is the blood by
[1:25] the spirit because the life is in the
[1:27] blood amen there's something here
[1:29] there's mercy here there's opportunity
[1:31] here
[1:35] greater is he that's in you
[1:38] than he that's in the world
[1:40] is hell here
[1:44] then heaven is here also
[1:47] and heaven is here in a greater force
[1:50] than hell
[1:53] how do you know heaven's here because
[1:55] the fullness of the word is here
[1:58] if the word has come
[2:00] heaven has come down
[2:02] where is heaven come down well i ask you
[2:06] where was hell at
[2:08] hell was manifest in people
[2:12] and j.c penney's all of a sudden the
[2:15] manifestation of hell required people to
[2:18] man it wasn't the clothes racks in jc
[2:21] penney's it wasn't the color of the wall
[2:23] it wasn't the lighting in jc penney's it
[2:26] was people who were anointed with demon
[2:28] spirits from hell they were manifesting
[2:31] the regions of the lost they were
[2:33] manifesting the regions of hell where
[2:35] was hell it was in the people
[2:38] so where will heaven be in the people
[2:41] amen there's two forces facing off but
[2:44] they're working in humanity in humankind
[2:47] in people and one is heaven which is in
[2:50] the bride and one is hell which is upon
[2:52] the people
