========================================

you know there's a problem we can't bear with one another and the person we should look at is the person in the mirror and say God why can't I just die to myself why can't I stop defending myself why can't I stop getting offended why can't I stop being so hurt I mean there's reasons but we need God to heal us we can't just stuff these things down and put a jar a lid on the jar and act like they're not there but we need actual Deliverance ourselves in order to be F be able to flesh this out we need God's help and that's why it's so good to look at these things and say you know what this is the Commandment this is what Paul's telling us this is how we need to act with one another and if I can't come to this I need something more from God to work on me so that I can come to fulfillment of this scripture because this is the word and the word has to be made flesh and where is the word going to be made flesh in the bride amen are you part of the Bride then this word has to be made flesh in you and I it can't just stay on the pages of the Bible it can't be a good teaching it can't be a good idea it has to actually become flesh and how many of you think God wants us to flesh out this word this commandment from the Apostle Paul for the Saints do you think God wants us to flesh that out then how are we going to flesh it out unless somebody needs forgiven amen like we've been saying I I want I I want so bad for my attitudes to change I I'm praying about it all the time that God will get a hold of this vessel and help me die to the outer man because I I I I always look at offenses and it and then it always is the same story how could this be happening and why is this happening and why did they do this to me and blah blah blah blah blah and and I need to get past that where I can actually die to myself and it doesn't matter anymore for if God allows it it has a purpose and it gives me an opportunity to flesh out the very nature of Jesus Christ and what happens too often is I flesh out the nature of the old man of Chad Lamb and I'm tired of that guy I want to flesh out the very nature of Jesus Christ so God's going to give us lots of opportunities how many have had lots of opportunities well just hold on you're going to get some more because this has to be made flesh it has to be made flesh and you can say why did my brother do that to me well in order for you to forgive your brother you to F to fulfill the scriptures yes that's a scripture that has to be fulfilled in order to forgive a brother you have to some point along the way have to have a brother who needs forgiven amen right so you mean the very fact that I have a brother who needs forgiven is part of the word we can't fulfill the word unless we have the opportunity to fulfill the word
