[0:00] when the church is rejected Christ in
[0:02] this day they put the light away from
[0:05] them
[0:06] and light separates Darkness from light
[0:08] that's why you can't stay in the system
[0:10] or your own system or separated from the
[0:12] light in any way whether in another
[0:14] church or in your own mind
[0:17] you can't stay separated from the light
[0:19] and expect to come to life
[0:21] we can only come to life amen when we
[0:24] stay in the presence of the sun and the
[0:26] sun brings the word that's in us to life
[0:30] and then all of a sudden when you
[0:32] realize what this is we become so
[0:34] grateful that God has rescued us out of
[0:36] the darkness amen because where did
[0:38] laodicea go it went into a total
[0:40] blackout amen is signified by the
[0:43] blackout of the moon and the eclipse the
[0:44] seventh picture wasn't even in the paper
[0:46] because it was totally black showing
[0:48] that the church has gone into apostasy
[0:50] we could never come to life there we had
[0:53] to come to life under the word for our
[0:55] day
[0:57] and all of a sudden all I can say is
[0:59] thank you God because I had no power to
[1:02] produce the light
[1:04] I had nothing in me that could make the
[1:07] light to shine to bring what was buried
[1:09] deep inside of this Earth to life amen
[1:11] and and who knew that laying under this
[1:14] part of dirt was life
[1:17] just like you go he types it with the
[1:19] creation amen back in Genesis 1 there's
[1:21] dirt everywhere who knows where there's
[1:24] germinated seed laying amen who knew who
[1:27] could walk and say there's a palm tree
[1:29] there's an oak tree this spot here who
[1:32] would know but God but God was going to
[1:34] show where the seed was and the way he
[1:36] would manifest the seed was to shine the
[1:39] light and when he shined the light it
[1:41] would manifest the sea
[1:44] so who knew that in Lima Ohio or
[1:47] Cincinnati Ohio or Lebanon Ohio or
[1:50] wherever you happen to be to be who knew
[1:53] that down in that patch of dirt was a
[1:54] seed amen who knew there was a sieging
[1:57] of God who could point and say that's
[1:59] one and that's nobody could you were
[2:01] just dead earth like the the beginning
[2:04] at the beginning of Genesis
[2:08] but God shined the light in this day
[2:10] through the message of the hour and when
[2:12] you came in contact with that line he
[2:14] showed where his seed was
[2:16] it was laying in that patch of dirt
[2:18] there and that patch of dirt there and
[2:20] that patch of dirt there and it wasn't
[2:22] because we decided to be something it
[2:24] wasn't because we changed our mind it
[2:26] was because he planted that seed in this
[2:28] dirt before the foundation of the world
[2:30] and he made the light to shine we didn't
[2:32] make the light to shine and that light
[2:35] began to pull something out of the seed
[2:40] it wasn't what we did
[2:42] it's what we surrendered ourselves to
[2:45] that's what the word did
[2:47] the word that was shining in this day
[2:49] and the word that was trapped in my
[2:51] heart
[2:53] the word brought the word to life
[2:56] the light brought life and the life
[3:00] brings light
[3:02] and we didn't do anything
[3:04] we were just here
