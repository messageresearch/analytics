[0:00] now this messenger of malachi 4 in
[0:02] revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[0:04] things
[0:05] one according to malachi 4 he will turn
[0:07] the hearts of the children to the
[0:08] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[0:11] of the seven thunders in revelation 10
[0:13] which are the revelations contained in
[0:15] the seven seals it will be these
[0:17] divinely revealed mystery truth that
[0:19] literally turned the hearts of the
[0:20] children to the pentecostal fathers you
[0:23] tell me what radio preacher you tell me
[0:25] what tv preacher can do that they can't
[0:28] do that they can't do that because
[0:30] they'll give up on the word they have to
[0:32] back off with a word to do that but the
[0:34] reason that brother branham could do
[0:37] this
[0:38] the reason god could purpose this for
[0:40] his life
[0:43] is because he knew he would not back up
[0:45] on the word
[0:47] and because he wouldn't back up in the
[0:49] word
[0:50] now god has a vessel that he can ordain
[0:52] with gifts to come and to fulfill these
[0:55] scriptures in malachi 4 in revelation 10
[0:57] 7. had brother brandon been somebody
[1:00] that would compromise on the word he
[1:02] would never be able to fulfill this
[1:03] position and i'll say it this way he
[1:06] says that's the reason god saved me
[1:09] was so that i could do this so that i
[1:12] could fulfill
[1:14] revelation 10 7 and malachi 4.
[1:18] that was the purpose god had in saving
[1:21] him
[1:22] and he says i am bound and determined to
[1:25] do that
[1:27] i am bound to determine to never deviate
[1:29] away from that word
[1:31] can we say the same thing
[1:34] can we say the same thing because
[1:36] remember it's the bride's position not
[1:38] to refulfill this as we talked about
[1:41] several weeks ago it's the bride's
[1:43] position to vindicate this ministry and
[1:45] you will never vindicate this ministry
[1:47] if you back up on the word you will
[1:50] never be able to vindicate malachi 4 in
[1:52] revelation 10 7 if you back up on the
[1:54] word and i'll say it this way god has no
[1:56] purpose in saving you if you will back
[1:58] up on the word
[2:00] it's pointless it's futile
[2:03] what purpose does he have in saving you
[2:04] if you would back up on the word
[2:07] none but because you wouldn't back up on
[2:10] the word
[2:11] that's why he saved you and you say well
[2:14] how did he know i wouldn't back up on
[2:15] the word because you didn't back up on
[2:17] the word before
[2:19] remember this is not the first time you
[2:21] have fought this battle you have
[2:23] resisted the devil's lie in heaven
[2:24] before and you have kicked him out i
[2:26] don't know how many times we fought this
[2:28] battle but i know that it's more than
[2:30] twice because we fought it there and we
[2:32] fought it in christ and we're fighting
[2:34] it now
[2:36] we didn't lose back there saints
[2:39] we didn't lose a calvary either
[2:42] what chance do you think you're going to
[2:43] lose now when you are a written bible
[2:46] you think the bible is going to fail
[2:49] not a chance
[2:51] not a chance but remember this all
[2:53] hinges on one thing
[2:55] you have to be called you have to be
[2:58] chosen and you have to be faithful
[3:02] you have got to make a choice
[3:04] you have got to get down with business
[3:06] with god and find out the purpose and
[3:09] the reason that he has saved you
[3:11] is not to walk around and say i'm a
[3:13] message believer and have no clue what
[3:15] the message even is it is your purpose
[3:18] to find out what the message is and then
[3:21] to walk into that
[3:23] and you can only do that through
[3:24] revelation by god himself
