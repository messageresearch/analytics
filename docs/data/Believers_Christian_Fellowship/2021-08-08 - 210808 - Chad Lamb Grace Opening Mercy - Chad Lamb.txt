of which you poured upon us your people lord we're so thankful and so grateful it's our pleasure lord to sing of your goodness the sing of your mercies and your grace and your magnificence lord that you'd be exalted lord in us god we just pray lord that as we come to the time now when we take this book lord and open it we're asking you to break the bread of life we're asking you to speak to us lord god you would share your mind with us and show us what it is you want for this hour what manifestation you're looking for and what it is you want us to be expressing lord as your children and god may you get preeminence among us lord and have your way live through each life lord as we surrender and lay ourselves bear may you pick us up and begin to use us for your purposes we ask that you would take every part of the service and every word that's spoken lord may it be pleasing to you speak the truth lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen man god bless you if you want to take your bibles while we're standing and turn to galatians chapter six this will say how much i enjoyed the special and i appreciate the lives that are behind the singing amen god has certainly been good to us and i appreciate the light that shines through god's people it's a bright light it's getting brighter this whole message it is all wrapped up in christ in you the hope of glory this whole message the whole understanding of the message comes down to god expressing himself in fullness in bride form at the end time that's what he wants when you see the lives shining through youth and to parents and through everyone then you recognize this is what god's goal is is to live his life in human flesh in redeemed human flesh in your flesh and in my flesh may we just yield ourselves more to that well i appreciate the youth for that it was wonderful amen also i'd just like to make an announcement before we read the scripture i just found out that aaron alyssa bonanno had a baby girl and so we didn't have time to get a picture up but she was born july 30th her name is gianna marie she's six pounds eight ounces and 19 and a quarter inches long so thank god oh we did have time to get a picture amen well praise the lord and god bless them and we're thankful for that god is certainly good amen god is always abundant in his blessings praise the lord let's read galatians chapter 6 and verse 9 says and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith i mean may the lord ask to add his blessing to the reading of the word as you're seated amen this is an unusual opening scripture but i hope by the end of the service it'll make sense to you especially where it says as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen i also before we get uh going here in the word i want to remind everybody that my family and i will be leaving for vacation on friday this coming friday the 13th we'll we'll miss four services so please pray for us while we're gone amen but i've got the ministry schedule all worked out so i'll go ahead and let you know what that is this wednesday it'll still be i'll still be here i still plan on preaching lord willing wednesday and then we'll leave early in the morning on friday but then the first sunday that we're gone brother kyle weikert will be ministering for us and then that wednesday will be brother ron garvin and then i've asked brother john nakadema to take two i've asked him to take two in a row on sunday and wednesday he was really gracious last time that he had service to give it up so brother ben could finish the second part of what he was preaching and so i've asked him just to take those two services so he'll be finishing that out whether jean kadema will on sunday and wednesday so pray for these brothers amen and pray that god will just inspire them and use them and come and pull on the gift and receive from the channel that god has for us and i appreciate having faithful brothers here that we can lean on when we're away and it makes it really nice for me personally that that they can just take care of that service and everything is stable at home we don't have visitors coming in and worrying about watching over them god has really really been good to us amen i'd like to for today i'd like to take for a subject like if i get a title i'd give the title grace opening mercy and so it's strange title i do some strange things sometimes but grace opening mercy and i just uh follow with me as we go but i'd like to lay a little foundation so if you turn with me to isaiah 53 isaiah 53 in verse 6. in isaiah 53 and 6 it says all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all brother ben said in the message israel in the church from 1953 he says in the garden of eden when man sinned first look at the nature of a sinner hiding but it should have been adam calling god it was adam hiding and god calling adam you see it that's the nature of a center hide run away get behind something but god calling oh my grace amazing grace god calling we read this scripture it says all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all it is we who ran away and it's never been us calling out to god it was always god calling for us and we're the ones who ran away we're the ones who ran away and gone our own way but he's the one so faithful as a shepherd to come looking for us and calling when adam had gone his way amen and separated himself from god he ran and hid from god and he heard the voice of god in the evening come walking in the garden in the evening and he ran away but it was god who was pursuing pursuing adam it was not adam pursuing god and so brother bam said one place he says it's not we who are going after god it's god coming after us although it looks like we're coming after god amen it looks to us like we're seeking god but we didn't seek god the bible says you can't seek god amen it is god pulling you amen it is the tug from god that we're interpreting is our search for god no it's god calling us let's turn to the psalm psalm 14. i'm going to read quite a few scriptures today so keep your bibles handy and practice your flipping skills we're going to flip around in the bible but psalms 14 and verse 2. the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one praise god it's better just to come to terms with it right out of the chute from the very beginning and says you know what i we he said i seek the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god he was looking for any and there was none they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one let's go to romans chapter 3. romans chapter 3 and verse 9 is where i'd like to begin what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before proved both jew and gentile that they are all under sin as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand that there is none that seeketh after god did you catch that there is none that seeketh after god they are all gone out of the way they are all they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of ass was under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their way and the way of peace have they not known there is no fear of god before their eyes that's a pretty bad condition amen there is none that seek god no not one there is none that doeth good amen there is none so we never came to god amen with merit we never sought after god we would never decided to do good amen that was never uh it was never first a choice we made it was first a choice he made amen by the planting of a seed and then there was something there he could work on something he could draw and he would begin to draw us and it was not us seeking god it was god seeking us it was not us running after god it was god coming to us and pulling us to him and if that was if it wasn't that process there was absolutely no way that would become because remember adam wasn't looking for god adam amen was the original spoken word creation in this earth and when he fell he didn't go after god amen he ran away from god god had to come after him and that would forever be the pattern from that time on it was god coming after you and i let's turn to ephesians chapter 2. in june ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins so what condition were you in dead you were dead in trespasses and sin before he quickened you or made you alive you were spiritually dead dead in trespasses and sin you weren't seeking for god you weren't looking for him amen he was looking for you and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the courts of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit thou now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast so there was nothing that we did to save ourselves and it wasn't our desire to be saved that has us saved because we didn't seek after god we didn't desire to be saved god desired to save us he desired to redeem us he resided to bring us back to himself we were separated by sin but it was his desire to bring us back amen and so with that desire he quickened us when we were dead and trespasses in sin and he made us sit in heavenly places in christ jesus already because god had a purpose and god had a plan and he had a desire and god's desire trumped all of our desires because all of our desires were wicked amen before we were born again when we were born of natural flesh amen we were just given over to the lusts of the flesh we had natural desires carnal mind with carnal desires and carnal doesn't necessarily mean wicked carnal just means natural and you were born with carnal nature with carnal desires amen with the carnal lusts and there was no way in that condition that you could do good and that you could seek after god and that you could find god it was god who was going to have to find you amen and by predestination he knew who would and who would not and he knew who he was coming after and he knew how to find them amen and he knew that he would he would put inside of you amen by the predestination by election he would put inside of you a portion of himself a part of the word amen a portion of his an attribute of god and in that he knew that there was there was a power there that he could draw from he had taken a magnet and laid a magnet down inside of you and all he has to do is click on this magnet and get it near you and those two things would begin to pull together because it's the father drawing you not you running after the father brother ben says in the seat shall not be heir with the shock that's why the rapture the bride the wise virgin the called out the for ordained the elect while you businessmen wouldn't run your office like some people try to think that god runs his program haphazard god knew before the foundation of the world who would be saved and who would not be saved by predestination my foreknowledge he saw every member put every name on the lamb's book of life before the church ever began jesus come to seek and to save that which was on the book the bible says i scheme to seek and save that which was lost amen that which was lost had already been written in the book amen it was already found before it can be lost that was a possession that was lost amen it wasn't gaining a new possession if it's lost it was your possession that you lost it was already a possession of god a part of god a part of this word and it was already a name in the book amen part of that book what is the believer the words in the book amen you are part of that book and he came to seek and to save that which was on the book he bought the book of redemption it was lost and he redeemed us and all names was on the book was redeemed when he redeemed us let's go to john chapter 6. i'm just laying in a foundation these things are familiar to us but i want to rehearse them and and iron them out because they they mean something and all these things that we learn they all mean something to us we are fundamental principles of the message amen that give us the right perspective and the right vision on everything around us and without that fundamental perspective amen we begin to misunderstand our lives and the things that are going on around us and what god is doing in john chapter 6 and verse 44. no man can come to me except the father which has sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day so this just reiterates what the prophet of god has told us what we've been talking about you can't come to god without god drawing you verse 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me i love the past tense of this because if you he says everyone every one every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned to the father cometh unto me amen so god is drawing you and you're coming to the lord but you're those who are coming to the lord are those that have already been taught and already heard from the father when were they taught and when did they hear from the father maybe when he showed the attributes the plan of redemption and they shouted for joy and they clapped their hand and they sang and danced when they saw the plan of redemption their names being put in the book and so he's drawing those who have heard and have learned of the father that cometh unto me not that any man has seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father so the only one who has seen the father is he that is of god praise be to god so let's go to chapter or verse 6 60 down here drop down to verse 16. many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them that this offends you what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before and it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet of nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believeth not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that would believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him so when jesus was preaching and jesus was calling and the multitudes were coming he already knew from the beginning who would believe and who didn't believe and he was still interacting with them and still allowing them to be near to him amen and god was not pushing away amen by by force or by rejection he was not pushing away those that were not already given to him who did not believe but the way he separated was by greater revelation of his word and as he began to reveal his word in a greater way it confounded the intellectual minds that it intellectually gravitated to this man they couldn't piece together what he said when he says you know what i wonder if you should see the son of man go up where he was before and then they're like what are you talking about before that he had said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me what is he talking about he's just giving the word he's giving the word but he's not giving the intellectual explanation of the word he's just giving the word and there were those who he knew didn't believe so he brought he brought another revelation of the word in that further revelation of the word began to separate the unbelievers from the believers because they were make believers amen they thought that they were believers but when the stronger meat of revelation began to come out it didn't compute in their minds they could not correlate this with what they had read before where in the old testament do you see eat my flesh and drink my blood they didn't see it as a commandment they didn't understand it in the in the writings of moses they couldn't put their finger on it but yet it was every bit the truth god had laid it in shadows amen he had showed it in times it was laying there between the lines it was in the bible but they couldn't go to the commandment where messiah a menstrual actually divide up his body and you'll eat portions of it and drink his blood amen they couldn't go and read that they couldn't understand the spiritual application they couldn't even understand amen what the sacrifice was fully foreshadowing so when he come to bring a greater revelation of the word amen the only ones that could stay there the ones that have been taught of the father and hath heard of the father and even they didn't intellectually conceive what he was talking about there was no conception in their mind because he said well you go also and peter says where will we go thou alone have the words of eternal life and we know and are convinced that thou art the son of the living god what else are we going to do i don't know what you're talking about i can't explain it i can't find it in the bible right peter brother says was an illiterate fisherman amen peter was relying on what he had been taught in the synagogues what he had heard ministers say and these same ministers that had taught him amen and that taught him the scriptures and taught him the law of moses they had all rejected and walked away amen from jesus but here is one who hath heard of the father and has been taught of the father and he doesn't intellectually know what it is but he knows one thing for sure thou alone have the words of eternal life i don't i can't compute with what you're speaking amen i can't find it in the bible right now but i know what you just said as words of eternal life amen how did he know that because god with the father was drawing him it was given to him he was already predestinated he was part of that book so now he was beginning to draw god would not keep them in this condition he would bring the revelation of what that meant and we know later that that the apostle paul broke that down brother branham says and there was a meaning behind the words and there was a shadow in the old testament there was a fulfillment in jesus christ and there was a partaking spiritually amen of the word and of the life amen and that was all broken down the disciples will come to understand it later but god was testing them not by understanding he was testing them by revelation of who he was so they could have easily walked away like the others did and felt justified because because they could even argue with the disciples he just said eat my flesh and drink my blood the bible specifically says do not drink blood the bible says pour the blood out even of an animal you're going to eat pour the blood out it has life in it that's for god amen the bible tells us do not drink or eat of the blood and he said unless we eat his blood and it goes to peter you can just imagine the discussions amen peter's extended family and those that didn't like him anyways and they heard a statement like that and said peter what kind of thing are you mixed up in do you see what he's saying that's a contradiction to the word of god and peter doesn't have the answer out of the bible but peter knows it's the words of eternal life amen he he knows it because the father's drawing him because he had heard of the father and been taught of the father praise god that's why jesus said no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father if you're able to come to him in this day thank god it was given to you it was not your intellect your wisdom your bible prowess your your your ability to accept the word and your desire to stay with the word hey if you come to this message i guarantee there was some things you had no idea how to explain no idea even where the prophet got that in the bible where where did i never heard a thing like that i never heard it said that before amen when i first heard serpent seed i said it's not even in the bible but it was all through the bible amen it's the false vine running through the entire bible amen but because i hadn't been taught it amen in my in my theological training from going to church by the time i was a little kid in sunday school all the way none of my bible training covered it remember when the prophet said it it was hard for my mind to conceive but there was something inside that was drawn that was attracted amen and it kept pulling and pulling and pulling until the two come together and clicked amen what was that amen my mind was rejecting my bible training was rejecting my desire to stay true to the word to the bible was rejecting what he said but my heart was accepting it amen something inside i was given to me of the father amen to come to him and i could see there's something to this and no matter how much reasoning and rationalization and bible memorization and all these things it doesn't matter how much was there and how much a fear the devil bought by taking a step beyond that i couldn't help it he was drawing me there was a magnetism to the word let's look at first john 4. first john chapter 4 and verse 4 first john 4 4. ye are of god little children what are you of god where did you come from god you were of god those are the only ones that can see the father the ones who are of god he said you are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error boy john you're pretty boastful you're pretty proud of yourself that seems to be arrogant it's not arrogant it's the truth it's exactly what jesus said amen i pray for not these alone but those that will believe on me through their words amen they had the words and those that were of god were attracted to the word of god and those disciples now were carrying the life they were carrying the spirit they were carrying the word and as they would bring the word amen they were speaking things that people had not heard before they were speaking things that was different than what they were taught but those that were of god heard them amen and it was a it was a vindication that they were of god let's go back to john 17. the gospel of john chapter 17. john 17 and verse 6 i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou has which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word why did they keep the word because they were god they were of god they come from god they belong to god they were gods and god gave them to christ amen so they already belonged to the father they were thine jesus acknowledging i didn't come and find something new i found that was lost amen i didn't come father i have it coming and i got you uh i got you a a bunch of disciples now i got a bunch of men i believe no he was seeking to say that which was the father's already which was of god and he acknowledges that they were thine so we know our position amen if god has called us amen this is why amen predestination is so very true amen because brother ben said predestination was based off for knowledge amen and for knowledge god cannot lose himself god knows that he's portioning himself out into the world and he knows that down through time amen these attributes of himself will be portioned out in different dispensations in different ages and that foreign knowledge he knew who would and who wouldn't because he knew the ones that has been thought of the father and had heard the father and were of god he knew that they would receive it and he knew the rest wouldn't so god by foreknowledge could predestinate he elected he chose amen his attributes to come amen in certain dispensations and certain vessels of clay amen to manifest certain works amen and you because you were there then because you're part of that amen you're part of that great god amen the attributes that we're in god amen the fullness of the word and he portioned a portion of himself out to come into a manifestation of your clay and in your being there's a there's a portion of god a part of the word that's laying there he knew you would believe he knew you would be magnetized with the word he knew he could draw you he knew he had something to work with and he knew that you would believe the word god wasn't hoping he wasn't guessing he wasn't he god wasn't just guessing that one day you would believe and there's a pretty good chance this one will believe and there's a pretty good chance that wouldn't believe that's not how we've been taught in the scriptures and that's not what brother branham taught god already knew because it was with him from the beginning it was his possession that was now fallen into a lost state and he knew that possession would hear his word and believe and it didn't matter what form it came in what tabernacle was speaking the word amen whether it was a rugged man with sheepskin wrapped around him whether it was a high priest that was speaking or it didn't matter or was it as a king giving prophecies and writing songs amen it didn't matter whether it was a farmer named amos who would march down in jerusalem it didn't matter what form it would come in it could be tabernacle behind anything amen but he knew that they were already predisposed they were already genetically programmed to receive the word in their spiritual dna so that's the ones god has been working with and that's one god been working his plan of redemption with is those seed genes of himself and and i lay that all as a foundation to get into what i really am aiming to get into so now if we could turn to matthew 25 i want to spend a little time here for the remainder of the service and brothers these are just things the lord is just dealing with me on it seems like as god keeps peeling layers of the word back we keep going back and looking at the things we've looked at over and over and over again but there's a new layer there's a new freshness to it there's a new power there's a new understanding that comes all the time a deeper understanding in matthew 25 and let's look at verse 31 it says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divided to sheep now if you get into the church age book brother benham says it is not a shepherd dividing his sheep these are not his sheep his sheep have already been gathered into the gardener but it's a typology as a shepherd separating sheep and goats and if you go back to the church age book he puts as in capitals a s as bold capitalized it's it's a type amen so this is not he's not separating sheep and goats he is a as a great shepherd separating two categories of people like a shepherd would separate sheep and ghosts but the sheep are not before him in the judgment the sheep are with him in the judgment he promised he says who that overcometh will sit with me on my throne even as i have overcome and sat with my father on his throne amen and the scripture says know you not that you shall judge the world so we know the saints shall judge the world and we know that that enoch prophet or daniel showed that when the ancient days were coming the books were set and the judgment is set that he would come with and there'd be thousands and thousands that ministered unto him and brother branham and the church age book would say that was his bride for the bride ministers to him they are with him on the throne ministering to him they are together in judgment judging together and this is the second resurrection amen we're all in the second resurrection was the resurrection of the dead saints don't die you never were dead you can't be dead even jesus says they sleep amen the bible says they sleep amen amen don't mourn for those that sleep amen there's there's a sleeping there's just a rest where the body goes into the grave amen and we know that your soul goes into your theophany in the sixth dimension you're not dead you're very much alive and even jesus when they were confused over the resurrection and pharisees and sadducees were battling it out and they bring to him an example this woman amen she has a husband and she has no seed and her husband dies he's got a brother she goes to the brother amen no seed and the process goes seven times and after seven times there's still no seed he said the the sadducees says now in the resurrection whose husband will she be they're trying to trip him up on doctrine because they don't believe in the resurrection and and jesus says you have no idea what you're talking about it's basically what he says but he's putting it layman's terms amen you have no idea what you're talking about for in the resurrection they'll be like angels and they'll be neither given in marriage nor are they married amen they don't have but the member said they don't have those sex glands that'll be no more that way no more marriage in that way so he says that and then he says but does not the scripture say that i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob he's not the god of the dead but god of the living what they were astonished they asked him no more questions where they were astonished at his doctrine what he told them basically is what he said is he says i am god of the living i am not god of the dead you don't believe in a resurrection because you think they're dead but abraham isaac and jacob are not dead but they are alive for i am the god of the living i am not god of the dead so abraham isaac and jacob are alive now is resurrection a problem no but it goes to show that there are some that are alive and there's some that are dead and these are spiritual conditions and are spiritually separated from god and at the white throne judgment it means going to judge the rest of the dead but we are not in that judgment because we bypass judgment amen the bride does not stand in judgment she was in the lambs the eternal part of the book of life the lamb's book of life amen the record of life coming forth of god's own life eternal life zoe life she already has eternal life she does not stand the judgment to find out whether she'll enter into eternal life or not she already has it and she's with christ she's united with christ their husband and wife sitting on the throne together at this judgment and they're judging together for the bible says no you not the saint shall judge the world and this is that judgment let's go back to the scriptures now verse 32 again and before him shall be gathered all nations and they shall separate them one from another as a shepherd as a as a shepherd divided his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on the right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world i was a hungered and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me and i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee hungered and fed thee and thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the inner naked and clothed thee our wind saw we these sick are in prison and come unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily verily i say unto you in so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me who is he talking to he's talking amen to those that he is going to reward amen with entrance into eternal life and he's saying you're going into eternal life because when i was hungry you fed me because when i was naked and this is this is jesus christ standing there saying when i was naked you clothed me when i was hungry you fed me when i was in prison you visited me and these are people from thousands of years and there's millennia of time represented here and jesus was only on earth for 33 and a half years amen they're asking they're asking a logical question when did we see you and feed you i was alive 2000 years after you were alive on the earth when did i see you and feed you when did i see you and clothe you amen when did i visit you and he says when you've done it to the least of these my brethren that are sitting with me on this throne when you've done it to them you did it unto me jesus is not he's not making that typology he's making it literally man when you did it to them you were doing it to me because this was making up my body amen i was dwelling amongst them i'm going to come back to the scripture but i want to read a quote here on crisis the mystery of god revealed it says now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible but i want us i want us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed i believe i can preach every day of my life on that alone christ is the mystery of god revealed that's the seventh seal friends christ being the mystery of god revealed now i took it in order as a sunday school lesson so we could all read together and have this fellowship together now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve he needed a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed so god has this mystery in the back part of his mind a mystery plan a mystery a of a plan an idea of what he wants to do and and he did this he had a motive in doing it he had a motive in doing this in order to let himself be expressed so what was his motive and this great plan that he had amen the motive behind god was to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star adam molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be savior and him was to be a healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god so in my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous messages i've tried to explain it break it down and now when angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun nor moon nor stars nor nothing then he was god as he asked job where were you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shout out for joy see now where were you that was way back before the earth so way back before the earth be before the earth was in the condition we know it's in now god had a plan he wanted to express himself he goes on the quote to say now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living the whole plan brother branham was saying god had this plan and that whole plan unfolded itself right down to this present hour right down to now so the plan of god has been unfolding itself even though it was kept in a mystery but that seventh seal was going to be open to the bride and she was going to see the unfolding of god's plan because it came in three folds so it was unfolding itself right to that hour and the message the unveiling of god he says like the attributes see it's in god an attribute is your thought god in the beginning the eternal he wasn't even god he was the eternal he wasn't even god god is an object of worship or something see so he wasn't even that he was elohim the eternal but in him was thoughts he wanted to become material and what did he do then he spoke a word and the word was materialized that's the whole picture from genesis to revelations is nothing wrong it's elohim materializing so he can be touched feel so what is this whole bible this whole bible is elohim being materialized so he can be touched and feel and in the millennium there is elohim sitting on the throne seed that's right with all of his subjects around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world so god had a great plan and in that plan god was going to express his attributes and those attributes were going to be expressed in man man that he would redeem back from the earth amen and in those men amen would be a portion of that word a part of that word a part of god amen a part of that life a part of zoe life however i don't i don't know all the terms but brother ben uses so many terms an attribute a thought a word there was men that would have this in their soul and they would be going along expressing what was it god is expressing himself god is wanting to be understood god's wanting to express his nature and his characteristics and he's using amen his attributes with the gene inside to begin to express god and down through time they've been expressing god amen and the picture begins to get clearer and clearer and it comes up to jesus christ who's the perfect reflection of god and in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all the attributes were in him there that's why amen that's why to me amen this is really my second journey on earth as far as i know i may have had others before because i don't really know what happened before genesis 1 2. amen i don't know i can't say maybe maybe not but one thing i know is brother branham said when he was on the cross i was there with him and he made me pay for my sins when i was there with him on the cross so when all of the word of god and all the attributes of god were expressed in one vessel i was there so this is my second journey on this earth as far as i know i don't even want to put a period behind that i just want to say as far as i know and it certainly won't be my last that i'm sure of and so the whole picture from genesis to revelation is elohim materializing so that he can be touched so that elohim could be touched let's go back to our scripture verse let's pick up in verse 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me you cursed unto the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was a hunger and you gave me no meat now listen i want to stop right here jesus said depart from me ye cursed now i don't want you to get in the image we we've got to break away from denominational thinking we've got to stop thinking childish thoughts jesus is not standing up here amen and on the throne and before him are two groups of people that he's separating and one are a bunch of bikers with tattoos and piercings and drug addicts and prostitutes and he's calling them cursed amen for their drug addiction and for their prostitution he's not judging this group and calling them cursed for their sins uh for their expression of unbelief for the demons that they were influenced by he's judging them by how they treated elohim as he was materializing and this judgment is not as though he comes up and say you know you you know you you on earth you had given yourself over to a demonic spirit and and you know you did so much evil and you passed out so much drugs and you killed so many people he's not talking about that in the this this portion of the judgment right here what he's doing is he's separating the sheep and the goats and he's separating them by one thing and one thing only he's separating them by how they dealt with the word and how they treated the word when they come to in contact with the word as it was materializing say brother tim what are you saying just let's just stick with the bible amen let's just stick with the scriptures and get this out of my mind that this is a bad group and this is a good group amen the ones he's calling accursed were priests and preachers and ministers amen people who lived clean lives upon the earth amen they were wholly considered holy men by everybody around them they had families and had children and held down jobs and paid their taxes and obeyed the speed laws and went to church every sunday amen but because they persecuted the true church because they fought against the truth amen because they called blasphemous names to the things that were actually righteous and holy and clean amen he wasn't judging them because they did they lived a nasty life on earth they lived a fine life on earth they they they they did good works on the earth they may have fed the poor they mean they may have have clothed naked children in africa they may have done all kinds of things but god is not calling them cursed amen because they didn't do good works he's calling them cursed because they did not receive the word in their day they didn't even treat it right they didn't even give it uh a clothing they didn't even give when the word was expressed when elohim was materializing they didn't even have the common decency amen to give him a little bit of food or even be kind to him the other group that he says enter you into the joys of the lord amen the other group that he says enter in he wasn't calling them amen if you by human eyes would just look at this you'll see in that group that goes that way will be the biker with the tattoos and the sleeves and the neck piercings but there was something in him that could love an expressed attribute of god there was something in him that just wanted to do something for you it could be your neighbor it could be a co-worker it could be who knows what it will be but there's something in them it's not a seed gene of god because they can't be a seed gene of god and not come all the way into the word amen but but there's something in them that loves elohim materializing they may not be able to break out of a life of sin they may not be able to stop amen the influences of their life or overcome past trials as a child and afflictions and all the things that they may not be able to get free from that amen but there's one thing that they can do and there's one thing amen that the that the lord jesus christ expresses in this separation is that when i was hungry you fed me but what about these tattoos i can take care of that what about my adultery and what about what about this and what about that amen that's not in question at this judgment at this judgment what is in question is what did you do with the word when you came in contact with it could you even be nice to it amen could you even express human love if you don't if you don't see the big picture if we don't get the big picture then this judgment doesn't make sense because somebody's judged listen they were not even confessing his name these weren't even christians some may have been some may not have been christian by name or title doesn't even they don't even have to be christians he's not asking them what they believed he's looking at what they did if we don't understand the big picture that god had a plan he had a desire and in the back part of his mind when he wasn't even god yet he was just elohim the self-existing one when he was elohim along with his attributes he wanted to have an expression and then that expression he would express himself on the earth and and in that earth he would express himself through men portioning himself out allowing that ex uh that the expression to come forth by degrees by generations and by dispensations and as it would come down god had a plan and he wanted to express and it was going to take a long time to express it wasn't going to be quick god had a plan in this expression and he wanted to express redemption and he wanted to express salvation he wanted to express holiness and he had to let things go bad so they could go good and then they had to go back he had to let these cycles run so he could get a full expression but but it was god expressing it wasn't moses it was god in moses it wasn't david it was god in david amen it wasn't jeremiah was god in jeremiah and what was it he was expressing he was expressing this plan of god he was expressing this desire of god as god was rebuilding the masterpiece coming back amen to a masterpiece son he was laying it through apostles and prophets and and upon the psalms and all of this he was beginning to to build it back and they were expressing and expressing and expressing and expressing amen and god was so concerned with this expression because listen we got to stop thinking this was moses expressing it was god expressing in a man called moses but the expression was god amen and that expression the way that that expression was treated will have everything to do with this judgment right here because it wasn't just you know it wasn't just a man it was god working through the man see god is righteous and just in everything he does and when god is going to create an opportunity for those who are not his attributes his seed to come into eternal life they will be there in the new heavens and new earth and god is going to bring in but the thing is listen god god is not foolish in any way god is not childish in any way god is perfect in every way so if he's going to have a perfect world purged from all sin and he's going to have a world amen where the heavens and earth unite into one kingdom and he's going to allow other people to live in this world why would we allow people that don't love his word because this is a materialistic materialization of the entire word the entire thought of god coming to full materialization and manifestation in the new heavens and new earth why would you let somebody in no matter how nice they were on earth and how clean they lived and how nice they dressed if they didn't love the word they won't love new heavens and new earth but who will he allow to come in those that no matter what they struggled with and went through in life and how beat down or rejected they were but there was something in them that could love the expression of elohim there was something that could love the word he was going to bring in those who can love the word not those who can receive the word they're already in we dwell in the city the ones who can receive the word dwell in the city but those who could love the word dwell outside of the city so it doesn't matter how marked up and how tattooed and how rough of a character and how rough of a life amen that's that's not what he's looking at amen how many good deeds and how many evil deeds and that's not what he's looking at what he's looking at is when you came in contact with the living word what was your reaction to the living word see friends not everybody can believe this message only a very very few but that doesn't mean that we don't care for souls and that doesn't mean that our only objective in this life is to get people to the message maybe my love for souls can go beyond my narrow thinking and recognize that there is going to be a tremendous amount of mercy granted at the white throne judgment granted upon people who may not have even went to church amen people who may have never bowed at an altar and prayed amen but people who had the capacity to love the expression of god as it was expressing through one of god's attributes and if they could just love that and serve that and do something for that there's going to be a reward for them at the end of the journey they can come into new heavens and new earth maybe i need to broaden my focus on souls and not just say my only job is here to get redeemed souls but i'm also here as a door a door of opportunity a door of mercy that's been extended amen this is like abel cain and abel abel had the capacity to receive the revelation cain did not have it but when abel by revelation was able to open the door to what was pleasing to god that was the word coming to manifestation abel's offering by revelation was the word and manifestation amen and now cain but because abel is rejected in his revelation the word cain are accepted cain is automatically rejected so cain's countenance falls he's upset god comes to him he says if you just do as your brother will it not be well with thee if you can just honor the expression won't it be well with thee god was not saying you're going to be a redeemed son no it's not what he was saying but abel's ability to catch revelation and express that revelation in that day was a opportunity of mercy for cain and cain would not receive the mercy that was opened unto him amen and cain judged himself god does not have to judge him he killed his brother doesn't matter what wonderful things he did after that he had already been judged let's continue reading verse 41 they shall then shall he say unto them on the left depart from me you you cursed unto everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels what horrible kinds of things did they do for i was a hungered and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink see the denominations picked this up and they use this scripture for their works programs for their missionary endeavors trying to promise people a chance at eternal life just by feeding a hungry person or sending clothes to haiti how how could a just god who lays down his law take a violator of the law and because he because he just fed amen a hungry person and clothed a naked body he could receive entrance into eternal life and the one who didn't do the good missionary works and then that one was cursed into everlasting fire it has nothing to do with that it's not about amen it's not about how many people we dress and how many people we feed and who we visit in prison it's about what you do with elohim with god with jehovah when he comes in flesh [Applause] when the word is made flesh what do we do with that that's what this judgment is all about he says when you did it unto them you did unto me he says you fed me you clothed me you visited me that's why this judgment is so serious and that's why this judgment has such a tremendous reward because it was god himself that we either accepted or rejected that we either served or refused to serve you know when we get to the new heavens and new earth you have those that dwell in the city amen but you also have those that inhabit the earth outside of the city and those that inhabit the earth outside of the city they're constantly coming to the city because the gates are not closed by day or by night and the light is always on in this city and the the gates are never closed so those who are allowed to enter into eternal life they have access to the tree of life constantly amen they have access to the elect the predestination they have access to elohim materialized well who's that well i trust that i'm one of them i trust you're one of them i'm trust you'll be one who's in that city who will be elohim materialized the family of god and flesh and they have access what gives them access what gives them such a wonderful access amen because when i when when that expression of elohim came down hidden in dusty clay like a regular man amen as a neighbor to you as a co-worker amen there was something in that life that was expressing that you were attracted to and you wanted to serve in some way you wanted to do some good for that in some way amen and that's exactly what you'll be doing in new heavens and new earth because they bring their glory and honor into the city what is their glory and honor brother ben said they're tithed amen they're out there farming the land they're bringing in all their produce all their tithe they're bringing their tithe and offering into the city they're doing in new heavens and new earth the very thing that got them into new heavens and new earth and the very reason they were granted eternal life they continue to serve the body i say praise god he's perfect in all of his ways let's continue reading we'll see if we can get further verse 42 for i was a hunger and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you took me on in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they answer him saying lord when saw we thee a hunger or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you and so much as you did it not to want to lead the least of these you did it not to me and these things and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous and to life eternal this word that he uses for righteous doesn't necessarily mean exactly what we would think it would mean we would say at this point of the judgment he's already passed judgment he's always declared the purpose for his judgment the reason for his judgment he's extended mercy to one and judgment eternal punishment to another and he's not calling them the the righteous as in they were always good and did al always did good deeds but this word righteous it also means it says in a wide sense it means upright righteous virtuous but it says it says in a narrower sense rendering to each is due in that in a judicial sense passing just judgment on others whether expressing words are shown by the manner of dealing with them so they were not righteous in all their deeds on earth they didn't live a righteous life necessarily but they were declared righteous by what they did with the word made manifest and those deeds were declared as righteousness the other deeds were not even brought up in this judgment so that's how the judge can consider them righteous because they can go into eternal life what made them righteous his declaration made them righteous his judgment made them righteous when he judged these were righteous and these were not based off his declaration and he based that upon their actions when they came in contact with the living word the word for their day let's turn to matthew chapter 10. matthew 10 verse 40. he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he the receiver the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple that means they're just a disciple they're not a prophet they're not a priest they're just a disciple they give to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward is jesus saying that somebody who just gives a cup of cold water until one of these little ones in the name of a disciple that's exactly what he's saying shall not lose his reward so there'll be a reward for that and according to matthew 25 that'll be a great reward brother brennan says in the sardisian church age he says to further clarify notice specifically the words of matthew 25 31-46 it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time white throne judgment the sheep are in his fold they heard his voice word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment that's all capitalized by the way they already have all capitalized they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment but these do not have eternal life and they are in the judgment they are allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren let's add to that let's make it more than that he doesn't he leaves it right there there's a period at the end of that sentence what upon what grounds do they enter into life eternal certainly not be upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren certainly not i'm sorry they are not his brethren they would make them join heirs with jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they sh they share no throne et cetera with them their names must have been in the book of life and not removed now because they're love of the people of god because of their love of the people of god they are recognized and saved for what because of their love of the people of god they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of god perhaps perhaps like nicodemus and gamalio they stood for the children in the time of trouble if this seems to smack a restoration watch carefully now for the wicked are not restored but turned into the lake of fire the names of many of those destroyed were in the book of life also but they were blotted out because they failed to honor the people of god who were the living manifested word living epistles for their day further down and a couple pages passed in the sardian church age he says thus if god has so designed it that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the lamb's book of life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that if it also states that there are those whose names were placed in the record of the book of life but in the foreknowledge of god they were to fall and have their names removed we must accept that and if there are those whose names were never placed upon the record of life we must accept that also and if there are those who will enter into life eternal after the white throne judgment solely solely he said solely solely on the grounds of being good and kind and just to the elect of god who are his brethren then we cannot but accept that for who knoweth the mind of the lord that we should instruct him rather let us be subject in faith to him who is our father and live friends that's the truth and that's the truth that's why that's why we should be living for others that's why we don't disengage from the world and pull ourselves into a commune i mean we can't do that amen because the very fact that abel could receive revelation and express that revelation opened the door of mercy to cain cain's the one who refused that but his expression of the word amen gave an open door to cain an open door of mercy that's why i titled this grace because the recipients of grace are the seed gene of god he loved them from the beginning because he loved himself amen it's himself coming into manifestation that's his grace and because of his grace amen we are we are saved through faith amen but grace opened mercy amen grace grace listen there's nobody that ever sought god there was no way to be saved once adam fell if god had not come down and injected himself in the scene there was no way ever for there to ever be salvation but god amen because he would not lose his own because of the grace that he had already for adam because adam was an expressed attribute he came down himself and he made a sacrifice and he made a way for adam to continue to moving on and god's plan would continue forward amen but without god's injection without god calling to adam there is zero opportunity for salvation now cain is born condemned abel amen is also born condemned but abel has a seed gene of eternal life on the inside and god begins to draw him as he meditates and wants to find the right ways to worship amen do you think that abel just all of a sudden decided to worship god was drawing him to worship but he was seeking a revelation and and abel didn't come up with his own revelation god gave him a revelation and what was god doing god was calling to his elect god was revealing himself to his elect he was opening himself to his elect so that his elect could express the word because by his grace he would reveal himself by faith to abel and by faith abel will express the word for his day making him a recipient of that grace and in doing so he would open an opportunity for cain cain's upset because he's rejected but god says if you'll just do as your brother won't it be well with thee and he could not receive it so he condemned himself let's turn to matthew 5. listen i'm going through some of the most simple scriptures fundamental out of the gospels but with the revelation of the word they explode and we start to see purposes and plans of god and things that he for ordained and reasons that we're here there's a reason you're in the neighborhood you're in there's a reason you work in the place you work amen you're there and you're there by grace and by grace god has given you his word amen by you receiving faith to believe his word you become a recipient of that grace you're born again amen and you start to express the very life of jesus christ and in so doing you've opened the door to mercy that everybody that comes in contact with you amen will be judged on the day of judgment by what they did with god expressed in you matthew 5 13. ye are the salt of the earth salt preserves salt saves you are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its savior wherewith shall it be salted it is henceforth good for nothing but to cast out and be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven he's giving us basic instructions in matthew jesus is saying you're the salt of the earth but as if you lost your savior who's going to take the salt who will be preserved if you've lost your savior ye are the light of the world but who will find their way if it's under a bushel basket see you're here as salt you're here as light not for yourself but so somebody else can benefit from that you take a light and set it on a hill you don't put it under a bushel basket but you put it on the candlestick and it gives the light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works that means live the life in front of them live the manifested word live the life of jesus christ tell me what other good works there are what else would this be referring to amen it's living it's the manifested life of jesus christ his life manifested in bright form that's the life that we're supposed to be living let your good works and that they may see your good good works and glorify your father which is in heaven this word glorify if you look it up it means to think suppose be of an opinion to praise extol magnify celebrate or to honor to do honor to hold an honor so your very conduct the way they see your good works will give them the thoughts and honor that they have towards god because what you're expressing why why is it so many people don't want to be christians and they say they're all a bunch of hypocrites because of the expression that they saw and because of the expression they saw they cannot glorify the father but when they see a true expression it says then what this word glory means is to think suppose be of opinion what it does is it shapes their opinion about god and when they begin to glorify that god in you their opinion of god is set right set correct they may never come to god but what they're doing is expressing what they like about you is the god in you what they love about your characters god's character and you what they love about your honesty and your integrity it's the life of jesus christ in you and when they express that they they're glorifying the father because where did you come from the father whose life is in you the fathers who are you of your father when my children get caught doing good works it glorifies their father brother rem says in god's provided place of worship he says but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and god himself that was god the bible said it was now he come down and he manifests himself there by turning his back in the temp where sarah was and told abraham what sarah was thinking in the tent is that right now jesus himself said at that day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost of the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man that when the husband and wife will be the same self-person god will be so manifested into his brightest church till they both be the same they are one now you see where we're at well take that revelation and apply it to these scriptures if they will be so one that is christ's life expressed in her the way you treat her is the way you treat him the way you accept or reject her is the way you accept to reject him because in the end time the mystery is he's come in the formation of the bride it's his life here in her and how she's treated is how he's treated that goes all the way back to matthew 25. i want to look at an example of this in the bible let's turn to genesis chapter 12. genesis chapter 12 and i say oh god help me help me to express this genesis chapter 12. now the lord had said verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of the country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house into a land that i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thee a great name and thou shalt be blessed thou shalt be a blessing so abraham wasn't to be blessed abraham was actually going to be a blessing and how look and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curses thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed abraham is beginning his journey and he's moving and then he's moving there's a promise that he will be a blessing and it'll become a blessing out of him into all the failings of the earth but he himself would be a blessing then he says all that bless you will be blessed and all that curse you will be cursed so abraham is an elect predestinated seed gene of god that god has called for this hour to express part of his word is that true and he begins to move at the calling of god into that expression and as he begins to move at the calling of god into the expression of god and he begins to move through palestine and all of a sudden because he's an expression of a thought of god and he's moving according to god's commandment now he becomes judgment upon the earth his very person becomes judgment upon the earth now when he's coming in contact with people in palestine when he's talking with the hittites when he's speaking amen with with others amen now god has already said whoever blesses you will be blessed and whoever curses you will be cursed so now the reaction to abraham abraham is here his very presence is judgment upon the earth god is already separating as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats in the life of this expression the separation has already begun amen the determination the final decree will be made at the white throne judgment but they're already separating themselves into two categories by how they react to abraham because abraham is an expression amen of the word of god god never said this when abraham was down on earth and god never said this amen until he called him when he called him out he began to move him in his commission and as he began to walk in his purpose the purpose of god that he had in abraham and he began to express god's purpose and as he moved into that calling into that position god would now say whoever blesses you you'll be blessed whoever curses you be cursed and as he's moving as the expressed word of god he now not abraham the man but the expression of the word in him becomes a judgment upon the earth there'll be those that enter in to eternal life after the white throne judgment because of how they treated abraham when he moved into palestine do you know when abraham went into palestine he had friends he had associates he associated with and they they're the ones who went with him to battle to help him when he went to recover a lot do you think they'll get a reward he already foreshadowed the reward amen because amen he already foreshadowed the reward because the king of sodom tried to give him all the riches he said i'll not take it i already raised my hand to god and swore that i will not receive any unless thou say thou made abraham rich amen but he gave ties to melchizedek and then then he was not going to touch anything else he said except for the portion to my fellows who came with me who were those those were the three brothers on the planes of memory his friends his colleagues amen that were in agreement with him that went with him that helped him what did they get and when he met melchizedek when he was trying to be rewarded by man he refused all the man's rewards because he wanted the blessing that come from melchizedek but he says you can bless my friends already foreshadowing the white throne judgment because we come after abraham abraham is our father of faith amen we're we're by faith to see the children of abraham so what happened there is still happening in the same seed line it's already in the bible it's throughout the bible and the message who is this melchizedek he says did you get it let me say that again the predestination is the only one that's considered in redemption people might be making like they are but the really redemption is those who are predestinated because the very word means bring to bring back is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place hallelujah so it's only the predestination will be brought back because the others didn't come from there see bring back being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of you that is thought of what you was only he wanted he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say he wanted you to sit at the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to earth to serve his purpose who's he talking about brother is he talking about abraham brother no he's talking about me the one that left home only come to serve his eternal purpose amen so abram when god called him he had come from the mind of god a thought that was going to be expressed and abram amen converted to abraham what was it was god's thinking god's thought being expressed on this earth and he only come to earth to express god's purpose and as he was expressing god's purpose amen all those who come in contact with that purpose will either be cursed or blessed the one that left home only come to earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified state it's matured and brought back again that's redemption redemption is the one that come down come and express god's purpose and after expresses god's purpose it matures and finally is brought back to a glorified state amen in a restoration but along the way of that journey amen when they come down when you and i and every expressed attribute of god comes and begins to express the light for your day begin to manifest the very word of god for that hour amen it is elohim materializing and it's judgment upon the earth why is it judgment because when we come to the white throne judgment amen god was not deciding then what he would do with these people it was already decided by what they did when they come in contact with word at the time they come in contact with the word they already made their choice god is just giving them their sentence they already made their choice they already moved to one side or the other god is now just giving the sentence or the results of their choice you and i friends are judgments if you're an expressed attribute of god if god if you if you were part of that thinking that god had before the foundation of the world you're part of that word and that word is portioned in you for an expression and you're moving by the leadership of god and expressing the word amen it's the word made flesh today it's the word and expression today friends that word is now judging the world people are determining their eternal destination of what they do with that word being expressed through you and i yeah that's the bible that's the scriptures that's the truth that's why we can't take this candle and put it under a bushel that's why the salt can't lose its savior that's why we can't express anything else but the word and just the word amen because there's got to be an attracting name and for those that will be declared righteous i don't want by my failure and by my my my getting smutted up with the world am i being too tired to express today and my being too frustrated i don't want to bring amen condemnation upon somebody else by my actions say brother chad can you do that yeah let's read the bible let's go to genesis 20. verse 1 genesis chapter 20 verse 1 and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and sure and sojourned in gerar and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerard sent and took sarah but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a man's wife but abhimalek cannot come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation said said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother and the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i.d not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine what did abimelech do wrong nothing where was abimelech's error where was his sin where was his failure where was he guilty abraham was an expression of elohim the very thoughts of god expressing god was writing his bible as abraham was moving through the earth abraham comes amen to garrar he's not even really supposed to leave the land but he moves down to gerrard amen and he tells they lie they say hey this is my brother sarah says abraham says sarah's my sister sarah says this is my brother amen and they deceive abimelech and abimelech takes her to be his wife amen he hasn't done anything wrong he says lord know the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands god said i know that's why i stopped you that's why i stopped you because you're cursed and they were already cursed because the bible says we'll get to in a minute it says he had fast shut up the wounds of his household in all the nation they were already cursed because they were beginning a curse upon abraham but it was abraham's fault it was abraham's deception it was abraham's fear amen abraham's lack of faith abraham's lack of faith to stay in the land abraham's lack of faith that god would protect him abraham's fear expressed abraham's deception and all of that was causing abimelech and to get in trouble with god but abraham was not getting in trouble with god it's just the bible that's all friends it's not like your thinking it's not like your justice in your mind of fairness your human mind of fairness is so different than god your human mind of justice just cast it out right now because god is not looking at this as one man offending another man god says i stopped you from sinning against me because this is my expression this is my word amen that woman has got to bring forth the promised son because it's my word this is an expression of my thought that i had before the foundation of the world and you by laying your hand upon that no matter how innocent you are you've brought a curse upon yourself because this word has to be expressed and how you come in contact with that expression regardless of your ignorant about it or not [Applause] amen regardless if how ignorant you are or not when you begin to touch the expression of god you find yourself cursed when you come against in any way the word of god you find yourself cursed abemolek in the integrity of his heart and the infancy innocency of his hand he was actually coming against the word he didn't mean to he didn't know that he was but he was actually coming against the word that's why i say friends be careful what you say about any other human being i don't care what they've done or what they said especially if they claim to be a believer you keep your lips zipped amen because you have no idea what god is expressing amen this is not a time to be critical about brothers and sisters this is a time to just not touch anything and let god sort it all out this is a confusing time and it's meant to be confusing because god is separating those who will from those who won't let god do his work but don't find herself even in ignorance fighting against god or touching his word in the wrong way he says i want to back up here and look verse 4 but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord will thou slay also a righteous nation why does he make this statement we're going to find the statement further down in the story i'm going to jump to it in verse 18. for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abraham's wife god had already brought the curse on his house and was going to kill the but it says for the lord had fast closed up all the wounds he had already done it that's why abimelech said will thou destroy a righteous nation because when you fast close up the wounds of everything you're going to kill that whole nation off they have no more children no more offspring so the the curse was already in effect because abimelech was going to take sarah who was beautiful to be his wife and he did it in innocency he wasn't meaning to be an offense or bring an offense to the word of god but if he would have went forward with his actions he would have been offense directly against the word of god let's go to matthew 18. keep your plate keep your finger here genesis 20 and turn with me quickly in matthew 18. i just want to look at a scripture matthew 18 verse 1. at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except you be converted and become as little children you should not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever there shall for therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me now jesus brings the little child into the group i've explained this before but he brings this little child into the group to use him as an example an example of how you ought to believe as a child so if you can humble yourself like this child and accept the true word and believe it like this child you'll be greatest in the kingdom and whosoever shall receive one such little child he's not talking about this little child anymore and now he's not talking about children now he's referring to children of the kingdom those who can humble themselves and believe the word so he's not talking about little kids this is where denominations also absolutely destroy everything jesus is teaching because now brother uh now jesus is going to say now when you receive one such little child who shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me and now if i just do good to all the little kids i'm receiving the lord because the lord's like little children he loves it when you're good to little children that's not what this scripture is talking about you can't start an orphanage to fulfill this scripture he's talking about the children of the kingdom those that humble themselves like this little child does and takes me at my word and believes me and if you receive one such little child as that then you receive me now i don't believe in being mean to little children but it's not jesus is not saying if you're good to a little child in my name in jesus name i'm going to be good to you little child i've just received jesus that's not what he's saying but they take this scripture and plaster it all over denominational orphanages misusing the word of god taking it out of context and out of place and so obscuring the meaning that nobody no longer knows what it means now if we're bad the little children we're going to go to hell for good the little children then we receive jesus it's talking about children of the kingdom when you receive one of the children of the kingdom you receive jesus next verse 6 but whoso whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck that he would drown in the depths of the sea he's not just referring to people who mistreat children he's talking about those who would offend the children of the kingdom if those would offend the children of the kingdom it's better for them that a millstone were tied around their neck and they were cast into the midst of the sea this is what jesus thinks about that you receive one of his little children in my name you receive me you offend one it would be better for you that a millstone cast about your neck and that you cast into the middle of the sea why because those little children are materialized elohim they are the plan and word and thoughts of god moving into flesh and expressing out the portion of the word for that day to receive one as to receive christ to offend one and that means to cause to stumble or to trip up to offend one it would better for you that a millstone would tie it about your neck and you're cast to the middle of the sea i say touch none of god's elected i don't care what they've done wrong don't touch them let's go while we're here keep your finger i'm not forgotten genesis 20. but let's go to galatians 3. galatians chapter 3. all right verse 14. that the blessing of abraham might come on all the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth her add it thereto now to abraham and to his seed were the promises made he saith not unto seeds as in many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so the promises to the christ seed which you and i are part of if we're part of christ so the promises of abraham and the blessings of abraham have come right down to us so what happened between abraham and abimelech if the same thing happened to you it would bring the same results because the blessing of abraham who blesses you all blessed who curses you all cursed that's come down to us the promises of abraham to possess the gates of your enemy and to possess all things that promises come down to us too because the promise was to the seed to christ and if you're part of christ you're part of that promise and you're part of that blessing so now who blesses you will be blessed and who curses you will be cursed let's go back to genesis 20. back to verse five i just want to read that again said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother and the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have i done this and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i.d not to touch her now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine so god is saying this man is judging you abraham was the one in error if we were judging we would judge abraham if we were using our own intellect and our own sense of fairness and what's right and what's wrong we would judge abraham amen and it's not that god doesn't ever chastise his children god has no trouble correcting his children they always come to repentance but in our minds we would have said abraham you're guilty and you have to pay for this but in god's mind he says abimelech you're guilty and you're going to pay for this listen i i don't understand and god knew that he was innocent but it didn't matter he was touching god's elect he was touching that word made flesh and god come down to stop him from doing it because he was going to be cursed and then furthermore he says restore the man his wife and have him pray for you and if he if you don't and if he doesn't pray for you then you're gone you're finished it doesn't seem fair unless you back up and get the big picture of what god is doing and what the word is and what god's plan was let's go to verse 14. now look what happens now they have a dialogue he and abraham have a dialogue and abraham excuses himself and says because i told my wife that because you're fair they'll kill me to get you i i told her to tell people she was my sister and i told him that she was my brother and we are half brother and half sister not good enough so a beam elect they have this conversation but look at the next action of beam elect takes and the beam elect took sheep and oxen and men servants and manservant and woman servants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife and the bible that said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with the other that thus she was reproved before abraham prayed for him what did abimelech do he blessed abraham he blessed him with sheep and oxens and men servants and maidservants he gave him a thousand pieces of silver amen for the restoration of sarah amen and he says this is my land go wherever you want in my land amen because the the word of god remains true who curses you is cursed who blesses you i will bless so obey me like now begins to bless abraham and then abraham says so verse 17 so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bear children for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abraham's wife so now abraham prays after he gets a blessing and he's blessed by this man he prays for him and god restores all to him and then he moves on amen and he moves on with all the blessings that abhinav had showered upon him amen and it ended up being salvation for abimelech to save him from the wrath of god that was upon him and you have to understand that that abraham was the one who brought the deception not a bema like he was innocent and when i read this story and i understand now amen the grand scheme of what god is doing and god with his great mystery plan has been unfolding it through time and it's just elohim materializing and god is holding people accountable for how they treat that and manifestation now i don't want to have a crabby day and be rough to the clerk at the store because i don't want her to be roughed back i don't want to cheat my neighbor amen because i don't want him to cheat me back i don't want amen i don't want to be hostile at work and be aggravated and intense because i don't want people to be hostile and tense back at me because god will forgive me my name's in the lamb's book of life he'll chastise me sure he'll whip me he'll correct me but i'm not going to be lost but what about these people that are coming in contact with the word made flesh amen i don't want to do what abraham did i want to live the life of christ and furthermore i want to go beyond that i want to so live the life of christ amen because he went about doing good to all amen and when i opened with the scripture it says amen we shall reap if we faint not amen as as thou have an opportunity to do good unto all men especially those in their household of faith why because i want to do good to them because i want them to do good to me i want to live a life like jesus lives serving others living for others manifesting the word shining the light i don't want to be irritable i don't want to be contemptible i don't want to be shady i don't want to be any of those things because i do not want somebody to be guilty of responding to me that way but i want to be loving amen i want to be just i want to be fair i want to be honest amen i want to shine the light i want the light to set on a candlestick for all the house to see so that all men will see the good works and glorify my father that's in heaven because when it comes down to the white throne judgment we're going to see some amazing things we will be seated in judgment with him we will see some amazing things friends at the white throne judgment and some of those that just loved you and they could explain why they loved you they could never receive the word you go to talk to them about the word and it just seemed like water off a duck's back they didn't reject it they didn't get hostile about it it just it was nothing to them don't get angry and don't reject them not everybody can receive it but for some reason they just loved you for no reason they just loved you and they seemed to be too good to you you've ever had somebody like that in your life well guess what they're going to receive a reward for that at the day of the white throne judgment and there's going to be a time when you're in that great city and the time beyond time amen when we're in the new heavens and new earth and that same friend is going to come into that city and look you up and you're going to have fellowship together and it's going to be a rejoicing time on that day because they don't have to know who you are they don't have to know what they're doing to you they're just being judged for what they do abimelech had no knowledge of what he was doing or who abraham was but it didn't stop the effect of the blessing in the in the message revelation chapter four part two it says now the first throne was in heaven judgment seat the second throne was in christ the third throne is in man now let me take this little thing that i got drawed here we're going to make i wish i had a blackboard that i could make it more sensible for you we're going to take and draw the quartz he's drawing the uh outer court the inner court and the holy of holies only make it round a ring or like this i believe like maybe would be best we're going to take and make the chords so he's drawing three circles to make the chords now what is man he's a triune being body soul and spirit how many knows that go watch god's approach watch his heart what is in his heart you remember my message god chose a man's heart for his control tower the devil chose his head for the control tower see he makes him see things look through his eyes god in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see god is on his heart in the heart of man is the throne of god you get it man god made his throne in the heart of man when did his throne come into the heart of man at pentecost when he divided the spirit and brought it into mankind his throne became in the heart of man so that means when all these come to the white throne judgment it'll be the second time they stand before god's throne not the first time they didn't know it the first time but they'll know it the second time there's an opportunity out there the word expressed is always separation the word expressed it brings life to some and it brings death to others that's what the word expressed has done in every age that's the word expressed as doing today but i don't want to focus on the negative part i want to focus on the positive part the word expressed is opening a door of mercy for those that can receive it those that can just love the word expressed for whatever reason they love it not having a seed gene of god not having the capacity by grace to receive the word through faith but just the capacity to treat the manifested word right brother benham said that they receive eternal life solely based on being good and kind to the brethren i say thank you god and if god has chosen me to be the manifested word i want to be the clearest manifestation of the word i can ever be eternal destinations are depending on it friends not just not just for the sons and daughters of god but for all that that have their name in the lamb's book of life amen there's an opportunity because that name can be blotted out and what will blot it out when they come against the word made flesh god's throne is in the hearts of man god's throne is in you and i in your heart and my heart and people of this world are coming before the throne of god day in and day out and day in and day out and someday when they get to the white throne judgment and you're sitting on the throne they're going to realize i've been before this throne before i was before this throne when that throne was in that person sitting right there that man and that woman sitting right there i've stood before this throne before but now comes the time to receive the reward for what you did when you stood before that throne the first time i say let's live a clean life a clear life let's live the word and the word only i don't want to be guilty of causing somebody to reject just because i was nasty i don't want to be guilty amen of being hostile or irritable but i want to live the life of jesus christ and i want to live it clean and i want to live it pure and i want as much as i have opportunity to do good to do good to all men especially those of the household of faith because jesus when he was on this earth he did good unto all and delivered all of those that were possessed the devils not only for the redeemed but for all when brother branham was here he was rebuked because he he got his feelings hurt and wanted to pull back from the ministry and he minister he preaches this and standing in the gap amen and he they didn't hear the word and he got offended and he got upset and he pulled himself away from people and and god come and rebuked him he says i realized i let a lot of sick people lay he had a gift of healing it wasn't just for the elect but it was also for mankind his life wasn't only it was an expression of elohim it was an expression of god so that god could be expressed in this world so that the light could shine it wasn't only so that you can come to church and say we're all the bride and so that you would go out out these doors and shine the light of elohim elode him materializing the light and life and character and the nature of god on display in this world and that nature and life of god on display in this world is a throne of judgment amen and some will find mercy and some will find cursing but i said god let my life bring blessings to multitudes of people amen how how many do you want to see enter into eternal life at the white throne judgment do we have a burden for souls we have a burden for individuals or do we only have a burden to make more message believers [Music] i want all the believers i want to find every one of those last seed but that's not my only thing in life that's being accomplished i'm also manifesting elohim elohim is becoming tangible so that he can be felt and i want people to see him and i want people to feel him and i want people to love him i want this expression of almighty god amen to go forth in a way that people are drawn they're attracted amen they love the nature they love the character and they say there's just something about that man there's something about that woman amen it's not their genetics from mom and dad it's the life of jesus christ on the inside they may attribute it to you know when you walk by with your family amen and somebody sees a mom and a dad and little kids and dressed in holiness and treating each other right sitting in a meal i want somebody to say that's right i want them to say that's right i want to say that's the truth they may never open a bible in their life but i want them to see the expression and i want them to call it truth i want them to call it right i want to deal with people so fairly in my business i want to be so above reproach in the way that i deal with individuals never cheating never taking advantage always taking the lower road so that they can say that's a real man that's a that's the way people should act they don't recognize what are they doing they're giving honor and glory to my father because it's the life of my father that they're seeing it's not me it's him in me i want to live that life amen but people will love that life not my old life not my old nature i want that to die and stay dead and i want to crucify it every day so that just the life of christ will be expressed and people will come in contact with it and say there's something there i like oh they might think it's you and they might think it's your upbringing they might think you know they might think you got lucky and just got a good wife and you got lucky and your kids just end up behaving they don't know it's god but when they see it and they say it's right they're saying the right thing they could see that and curse it and say how can they do that and how can they how can they live that way won't they let those kids go free they're bringing a curse upon themselves but i want to live such a way that multitudes have an opportunity to say something right to do something good with me and my family we were we had young kids we had four or five of the young little kids they were all around us and we had went to i think we went to the indianapolis children's museum i think is where we went we were driving back from indiana and we stopped at a steak and shake i'm giving you way too many details but that's just the way we go in and eat and we sit down and eat normal we're not doing anything out of the normal we're doing what we always do amen we bow our heads and pray the kids are mannerly they ask for things we we order we're we're just interacting the way we always interact nothing unusual and when we go they ask for the bill the waitress says somebody already picked it up for you and i don't remember what she said something about they liked your family or so i can't remember exactly but it was something along those lines somebody repaid it for you i say whoever blesses you will be blessed what did they pay that bill for did they pay everybody's bill or was there something was there an expression of the word they saw amen that caused them to glorify and on to see your good works amen and glorify your father and say something's right about that i want to do something and i'll tell you what i can say on that day i was hungry and you fed me i don't know who it was i i tried to think back and who was it in the restaurant and their faces i have no idea who it was but god knows who it was friends and all we were doing was living a christian life and i say live the best christian life you can live surrender completely to god let him take full control of your life because on the day of judgment on the white throne judgment you might be pleasantly surprised at some surprises that are laying there and then you will be saying thank god thank god thank god thank god this message amen the the the people want to say the message is exclusive it's the most inclusive thing i've ever seen in my life i've never seen anything where god is so merciful amen and so loving and so kind that he will grant eternal life amen to individuals just because they treated his expression right in the day he was expressing himself everybody else would put those people to hell but not this message because this message is christ amen it's the very character and nature of god and it's explaining to us our mysterious and misunderstood life why do we walk the paths we walk why do we rub shoulders with the people we rub shoulders with why listen instead of dreading going to work tomorrow go to work with an opportunity for mercy amen an opportunity for life don't go to work in every situation you face no matter how difficult amen no matter how many people you have to get involved with and obstacles and things you know sometimes things break just so you call the right repairman or you go to the right garage or who knows what it is but we have to stop seeing ourselves in such a narrow vision and see ourselves the way god sees us as an expressed attribute of himself his word on display the judgment seat the throne of god is also a mercy seat amen and the throne of god is in the heart of men and every day judgments are taking place people are judging themselves and on the white throne judgment it will all be sorted out brother brennan says in the message the unveiling of god he says he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to other die to the denominations to reveal him to others he died to reveal himself to us i want to die to reveal him to the world whatever the world does they'll do and they'll be judged for it but i want to give a true true revelation of the word i want to give a true expression of my father i say god help us help us to be true lord help us to take up our cross daily to die to selfishness to die hey listen somebody cut you off in the road you start laying on the horn and waving your arms at them do you think they're having good thoughts about you and we feel justified in actions because of what they did listen remember abraham and abimelech in every situation you're going to remember abraham and be my leg don't cause it don't cast a stomach stone in that man's way don't do something that will harm them eternally i say let it go friends amen if they do you wrong let it go if they cheat you let it go if they call you all horrible names let it go it's going to matter there's going to be a time that it matters at the white throne judgment and i don't want to be sitting there knowing that i was the one who was pumping the brakes because he was too close behind me and i was getting irritated at him do you understand friends i want to live the way christ would live on this earth not the way chad lamb would live i don't want to be irritable and cranky and angry and hostile i just want the love of god to project out of me and i want the word to flow out of me and i want the light to shine and i don't want anything else to shine just the light if somebody wants to ride in my bumper let them ride praise god maybe i'm protecting them from an accident somebody wants to cut me off they needed to get there faster than i did let them go if somebody wants to cheat me out of my tent in my magazine what are you talking about brother chad come to brother branham's house have him sign papers and a guise in deception to steal his tent and to steal his magazine what did brother brahm do he signed the papers and when he was walking out the door and as he was walking out door by the room and said oh wait a minute brother say stop he says next time you're in town won't you preach for us why can't we live like that when brother branham was was at a a meeting they would have meetings where brother brennan was called to the meeting i mean just to advertise it to get his friends to come that's what he said one day he was there and they didn't like what he was going to preach and he was coming to the meeting and they held him in the back and they told the congregation that brother branham's not here today his brother's sick and he had to go it was partially true because his brother was sick but brother madam was going to go after he preached they brought deception and brother man was standing there he could step right out the door he was getting ready to come he could have stepped right out the door and exposed the whole thing and somebody later asked him why didn't you do it he said oh i couldn't do that that would hurt that man's ministry most of us have been like i'd have been out there waving my arms and jumping up i don't want chad lamb to ruin a chance at eternal life i don't want my old carnal nature that came from my parents and my grandparents i don't want that thing to rule me i want to be ruled by the word of god and the word only i want to lay down my life and i want to surrender my life and i want to shine a clear light without any smut or smoke on the glass of my of my lantern i want to set it on a pole and i want everybody else to see my good work not mine but his and me that they would glorify my father which is in heaven and then glorifying my father which is in heaven saying that's right that's true that's the way you ought to live that's honest that's a good thing i want them to glorify my father and find themselves a blessing coming in their lives for the blessings of abraham have come from us the judgment is taking place all around us because we're the manifested word there's a separation going on and i said god i want as many as possible to come into eternal life this is a love of souls friends a love of souls to live your life in such a way you can attract the soul to the light of jesus christ but they didn't believe the message they may not have to believe the message you only have to believe the message if you're a predestinated seed but as long as you don't reject it you can still do service and find a reward let people do a service let them love you and let that be enough because if they're hungry they're going to keep coming and keep coming you don't have to worry about a seed once you give them a little light they'll come back for more once they get a little manner from heaven they'll ask you for more amen what we're here to do is just live the life of god express elohim in this generation what is our duty our duty is to express god express the lord in this in this nation in this neighborhood in this place where we live that's our duty i say god help me to do my duty and to do it honestly to do it with no evil and do it with none of my old nature but just let your light shine go let's all stand together musicians if you come and brother ben let's just bow our heads and pray oh lord we thank you father for your word god you have so lifted us up into a whole another level lord where you're taking the simplest of verses and you're peeling them wide open for us lord these aren't things we've never heard but oh god they're just becoming such a reality to us let us live lord our lives for this word help each one of us to be a true expression of the word may we stop lord whatever carnality is holding back that expression may we surrender it now to you whatever self-love or self-gratification or whatever whatever it is lord whatever part of our nature lord that is that is causing the problem we're just surrendering that now to you and pray you take it out of us god let us shine your light let us live your life lord let us be so surrendered that it's the word and the word only and it's that light that's shining through us and god may others find an opportunity at life god i love you let us not be selfish with this light that we have but let us let it shine shine out into the world lord in our mannerisms our conduct our speech let us constantly be speaking the word living the word manifesting the word may it haven't attracted lord to those that are able to receive those that are able to love use us for your glory let us walk in this life fulfilling your purpose let us surrender our hearts and lives to you bless each one of your children lord as we go out of here may we go more resolved than ever to surrender more determined to lay down our life and our nature than we ever were before may we just give you more of ourselves and keep giving you more of ourselves and may you take that which we give to you and manifest yourself through it may you shine the light brighter and brighter than you've ever shined it before and may that shining light be attractive lord that you can use to draw we love you lord we ask your blessings upon this word make us more like you lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen [Music] it's such a beautiful [Music] [Music] [Music] the [Music] it's such a beautiful [Music] a mercy [Music] all around us [Music] you know so many times we've been plagued with thoughts and the devil will bring thoughts into our mind i don't have a singing gift i don't have a preaching gift i'm not an officer in the church i don't have this i don't know what am i doing for the lord you may never see it in this life but you live a christian life when you go to the grocery store live a christian life when you're part of any event or where your children are part of or whatever you wherever you go whatever you do and whatever circumstance and work and fellowships and wherever you're at you just live a christian life a pure clean christian life and at the white throne judgment you might find out what god was doing with you all along why you were where you were and expressing what you expressed i mean it's not the full life of god is not just expressed in preaching gifts only singing gifts amen god is here to display himself in a mini-membered body it doesn't matter which part of the body and which expression and where you find yourself male or female teenager or older senior or youth it doesn't matter where you're at you be a real christian and shine the light because you're going to find out someday just how much value there was in you being here expressing the light don't ever let the devil put those thoughts in your mind that your life is not worth value you're not really doing something for the kingdom i don't really see any fruits you just keep living the life you may never find out on this life what you've done for a brother or sister the encouragement you gave to another one of god's children or what you've done for those who are able to receive life at the white throne judgment just give everything to him and live fully for him and get those questions out of your mind because if god wants you to be something he'll put you there but if not be what you are now and express him every day oh i love your friends i'll tell you more than anything all i want to do is be like him just want to surrender to him let's sing brother men i want
