musicians thank you i have a little bit more of a nathaniel science voice today that i'm pretty happy about got a few degrees lower had a little head cold this week so uh you'd be praying for me i uh i kind of like it i gotta admit it sounds kind of nice but i just don't have a lot of volume behind it so i definitely won't be able to do what brother nathaniel can do so um but i'm happy to be here and uh i sure appreciate the opportunity by god's grace if you don't know brother chad's on vacation but i'm sure you most of you do and wow that's even better and um does that bother you sorry so but he's doing fine i do believe in how many are praying for him i'm praying for him praying that the lord just restore the strength of our brother his family of his children and and you know uses them as a light in the dark world wherever they find themselves to be and i'm sure he'd also be praying that the fish will be biting so you'd be praying for that as well but just continue to lift him up and just want to let everybody know brother ron will be here on wednesday preaching for us and then brother kadima after that so we'll be lifting them brothers up in prayer so um makes me nervous you know i'm like oh boy what announcements am i going to forget i don't think there is anything else but i uh yeah okay now you can stand let's just go to the word if you will you turn in your bibles to first peter chapters 2 verse 9. first peter chapter 2 verse 9. amen but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul having your conversation this means a manner of life honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evil doers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation and also john 17 17. john 17 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also may be sanctified through the truth we just bow your heads gracious heavenly father we come before you once more today and lord we do deem it a great honor and a privilege that lord you've called us and chose us and elected us and lord have assembled us together but now lord we're asking that your great holy spirit would now brood over your people lord lord that you would soften our hearts father lord that you would remove anything in our lives and in our hearts and our minds that's hindering the expression of your life in us father that you could come down now and lord sanctify me as a speaker lord i know i'm in able and i'm weak but lord it's in weakness that your strengths are made strong and lord i pray that you would sanctify the ears of the hears lord that they could hear and receive those things from you that will bring them to that further expression of your heart's desire father we love you with all of our hearts and we appreciate all that you've done for us and continue to do now lord do the supernatural part lord make your lit word live in our lives may it be the word becoming flesh and now the flesh becoming the word we love you we thank you we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen amen you may be seated so i wanted to if you've noticed there's some similarities in some of these scriptures in accordance to where the our pastor's been going from sunday and on wednesday service and if something happens where i think god is significantly doing something or he guides me in such a way that i think it's of significance i think we're mature enough people to realize i'm not trying to exalt myself but we believe that god works in the presence of his people and the supernatural elements and little things that he does and i i wanted to share with you this i feel like i'm going to go in the exact same direction as brother chad i don't feel like it i know i am and i can't do anything about that because i had come here last saturday and was praying for brother daniel and as i was praying and interceding for him i i started praying for the youth and as their faces come before me i pray for him and i started praying for all of you as your faces come before me i started praying for you interceding for you asking god to bless you and as i was praying i said you know lord i got a youth meeting tomorrow and i've i've got this sunday service before me here in a week from now i really don't know what the next step is i know what you you told me the last time that there's a choice that must be made and it's an expression of divine love when you know the until the chosen make him their choice it's a harder choice to make it's very hard um and and i saw that lord but lord what's the next step and i just began to pray and you know and i'm real simple and i guess i'm just i just don't know anything more than if i ask god he'll answer i don't maybe i'm but so i just was asking him and i says lord what what do i do now what's my next step and i was praying for a little bit and i had this little piece of paper because i always i'm kind of funny if i get a little inspiration i'll write something down on a piece of paper and you know maybe god will do something with it so this is the paper and i walked in the doors there to come pray had a little pen with me and i was praying and just real subtle real just a little you know little words come to my mind and i just wrote it down and on the top of it i wrote down remember thy divine purpose and i thought well that's interesting you know and then a little bit time goes on and i and i i flip the page over in another one he sanctified himself for others and so i i sat there and i looked at that for a little bit i went home and kept praying and going a different direction but i just seemingly couldn't go another direction it's like i needed to look at this don't forget remember you have a divine purpose and also paralleling it here with jesus setting himself apart for somebody else's sake and as i began i that morning i got up early and started praying again you know just what do i do and and it just like a just a firecracker it just went off real quick and i was like okay now esther because i've been in esther here for quite some a while if you all know i've been drawing lots of inspiration from there the bride of his choosing vashti who rejected his calling and then the chosen making him their choice him or his choice and so in all of that then i began to realize you know esther was chosen to choose after she made her choice she was accepted after she was accepted she was in the position of intercession and i took that and i realized that was in joseph that was in moses that was in enoch that was all throughout the bible all these bible characters are put in the same position and they have to express christ in the same way at the same time that was in brother branham that was expressed in sister hattie wright it just it kept going like that i says now here's moses he was called he was chosen of god but then after he was called and chosen he had to make his choice brother branham said he had to walk in his own choosing and as he walked in his own choosing he was loved of god he was brought into the presence of god and the pillar of fire then he finds himself throwing himself in the breach in exodus 32 32 saying lord blot my name out but don't forsake thy people. and that stumbled the prophet of god he said how could a man do this he says it was christ in that man expressing it was christ in moses saying blot my name out but do not forsake these people there was something throwing him in the breach and it was so interesting so i started just writing down all of these these notes about this and here's all my notes from early sunday morning and then brother chad gets up and preaches everything and so i've been in turmoil that's how i tell the kids i was like honestly i'm not going to add one thing to my notes i'm just going to repeat everything brother chad said but i promise you i promise you i didn't i didn't you know but when that happens i mean who who are we as a people to say i gotta go preach something different i can't if god is putting an inspiration he's saying this is the next step you tell my people this and i have a hard time even saying that but yet i believe that i believe that he wants you to know this right now it's of vital importance and so if he gets up through the ministry and says the exact same thing that i'm at home and i want to preach the exact same thing what more can i do but preach just the exact same thing so i've titled this today verily verily remember thy divine purpose and the reason i say verily verily as you probably all know i was praying and honestly i was saying lord i got you got to give me something else i got to go different direction and i stumbled across that one of these quotes that brother branham was explaining verily verily and he says and verily verily he was bringing special emphasis brother ma'am says in quotations listen close absolutely absolutely the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing he the son doeth likewise and i says i know that god called me i know i'm a son so i better just do what he's called me to do i'd rather be found stumbling through putting a few words that he told me to say than putting together a masterpiece of a thousand words of something he didn't want me to say and i think that's the expression of every heart of the believer right and his he just wants to be what god made him he just wants to do what god called him to do he doesn't want to add to it he doesn't want to take away from it he just wants to express god and the purpose that he made him and so when i was talking to the kids i you know i was explaining to them you know the bible says we are fearfully and wonderfully made god made me with a purpose and he made you with a purpose you may not like the way he made you but he made you with a purpose so if you have confidence that god puts you in the position you're in you have the makeup that you have you had the parents that you had you had the upbringing that you had it must have been for a divine purpose for god to express something in his great nature through you that only you can do and that's just the reality of it you have some portion of the expression of god that has to be distinctly you because it's distinctly god and you cannot change from that expression and so when i began to just think about this more and more i said so well this verily verily okay lord i'll just go say it again and i hope that's okay i'm certainly i'll say some things a little bit different because i i'm just different you know but maybe god wants us to pay close attention to this because i find in esther you know esther at 4 it says 14 it says if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place god will preserve his elect but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and you knoweth whether and and who knoweth whether or not thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this so mordecai isaac admonishing her and says you know what god will preserve his people some way the promises will never fail god will preserve his people but one thing you will know you and your father's house shall surely perish if you don't do something to intercede he was reminding her you know and we know if we follow the types there obviously mordecai was a type of the holy spirit clearly he had to be here is esther she loses mother and her father she comes and she's now under the tutorship of mordecai and mordecai trains her in a certain way with a certain character and a certain understanding of things and here she comes into a great position she's been chosen you know i'm sorry i'll back up here for a little bit but she was chosen along with a leather a lot of other women that were chosen she couldn't glory in the fact that she was chosen though she was chosen she was happy about that but now she was put in a certain position to make a certain choice and that certain choice was going to express the hidden secret part something that was in the back part of the king that he couldn't come right out and tell all the virgins do exactly this this this and this because if he was just evaluating and choosing based upon human beauty vashti had them all beat she was unbelievably attractive no doubt because the king wanted to bring her before all the people and show her off but the problem of it was she was disobedient she couldn't stay in some hit simple humble subjection to the king's command she wanted to do her own thing and we know this to be following up and i'm sorry i'm just reviewing here but when when esther came before the king here she is now she's listening to haggai now haggai the prophet of god to the age is instructing this woman and no doubt he was giving instruction to other women that were there but this one particular woman was listening very intently to every word how it was said and what was said and she wasn't going to add anything to it and she certainly wasn't going to take anything from it and she presented herself one day before the king after she also had the help of seven fair uh made chamberlain's from the king's palace you know seven church ages and seven seals and here she is now she has her opportunity to present herself to the king but she only brings the king just what the king required that little portion that wasn't spoken of because all the other fair young virgins certainly added to the presentation or they took away but one thing esther did not do she just took and she just came as haggy i instructed not adding one word not taking one word away from it just staying with that and she was accepted because of this and because she was loved she was accepted she then came to a point in time that she could intercede and mordecai then reminds her it's like hello um you know you're in the palace you're chosen god chose you you can glory in that you can bask in that or you can realize perhaps god brought you there for a reason and so many times that's why i said that's why i think i wrote down remember your divine purpose because we can forget we certainly forget we certainly can get the attributes of spiritual amnesia in this hour and forget why we're here upon this earth we're not here to just have a good time to make a bunch of money to enjoy ourselves to go on vacations no i have a divine purpose that's way bigger than that and so i want to spend some time with them and i'm just going to refresh here for a little bit until because thou has chosen the narrow way the harder way thou hast walked in thine own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise way and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision that was made this in and of itself shall make or shall give and make to come to bring to pass a tremendous victory in love divine divine love had to be projected because the right people have to make the right choice at the right time in spiritual amnesia brother bam says this and why i want to emphasis in the sense that i do believe you can forget and you might have brother brahm says now this amnesia we are told that it can it can come upon you and you cannot identify yourself now it's an unusual thing you don't all it don't it doesn't happen too often but the cause of it is shock it's somebody that doesn't know who they are you find it in wars sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing that causes it is worry worry will cause it the spiritual amnesia forgetting who you are worry has no virtue in it all worry forget worry accept faith someone said well now what if you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry he said no i don't think so why i said worry won't couldn't do nothing but make it make me worse well what good what will it do to have faith he said it may deliver me and that's right so worry has no virtue in it all but faith has all virtue belief now worry sometimes causes it another thing that can cause it is when among people is getting halt between two opinions this causes this amnesia and you get it you get to a place where you you actually what you've done is you have lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can't you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk eat talk everything and you can't identify yourself you have got your scholarly educations but you don't know where you came from and you don't know who you are where you belong you see this is an amnesia that we are told and that's why i want to speak about i think it's something we can forget too easily because we're in a great battle and we all know it 200 million million demons are every day waking up with you on their mind how can i get them off of their divine purpose how can i get them convinced that there is something else more important than just expressing the purpose that god has called them to this earth for so what do i do so brother branham then goes on to say they had a real bad case of it after god had been so good to them and brought them up out of the heathen lands and made them a separated people he separated them unto himself he said he took of the vine out of another country and he planted it into another country and how he fixed it and made it to grow in fruit and be fruitful but the vine forgot where all those blessings had come from so has god's people in this last day has forgotten the testimony of what it means to be a christian it's again that amnesia has become has come upon the people and they cannot identify themselves they had forgotten all about it they had forgotten his holiness they had forgotten his laws the woman started to act like all the other rest of the women god's church and his people has always been a separated people a called out people a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to god giving the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name god called this church and separated it from the world for that purpose and he gave them a law that they may be holy as i am old holy they are holy and without holiness no man shall see the lord god said unto him himself so we can see here very clearly that god has chosen you as a royal priesthood and what does a priesthood do he intercedes that is the essence of a priesthood a priesthood intercedes that's what you were called to be you were called to maintain a peculiar life you were called to be distinctly different from the rest of the world you're aiming to look like the world act like the world talk like the world because you have a divine purpose you have to sanctify yourself keep yourself in a sanctified state so that you can constantly be in a position that you can intercede and i hope it's okay we're just going to fly through all this and i want to bring it out from enoch brother branham said enoch was a perfect reflection of the word that he was pointed to enoch was the living expression of the word of god in a human flesh and if you remember about enoch brother branham says noah kept his eyes on enoch i wonder why just because he's family in relation no because he was the living expression of the living god in a tabernacle in a human flesh so much so that enoch kept his eyes or noah kept his eyes on enoch and he knew that if enoch went missing judgment was sure to come you know what brother bam said so enoch while he was here the life that he was living was holding back the judgments of god to strike upon this earth and so much so this life that was being lived and projected before the people so much so that noah a type of the foolish virgin kept his eyes on enoch and brother banham said when enoch went away noah started hanging around the ark because he knew tribulation judgment is coming isn't it an interesting thing you know maybe you're living a sanctified life for the foolish virgin maybe you're living the kind of life so that other people see not that they're going to be converted and become a the bride but they could be saved through great tribulation because you held yourself in a sanctified state you threw yourself in the breach constantly now let's just keep going job job did the same thing job wanted to know god god chose job didn't he he clearly chose job so much so that he even reminded the devil you know job hey he's mine you want to go pick on him for a little bit sure go down but he was testing job and job had this great time of testing but job made his choice in the time of testing where he said god giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of god he wasn't going to bring a reproach or speak evil against the lord he was going to commit himself to the lord and find say hey whatever state i find my end there i am content because god knows what he's doing and that he had passed the test and he come to the point where his good old friends those wretched friends that he had had come to the point where now what happens to them because they spoke evil of him now if he doesn't do something for them surely they're destroyed but what did job do he interceded on their behalf and they were spared and this pattern continues on we can go through abraham but i don't need to brother branham or brother chad went through abraham so i don't need to do that but just to you know he was chosen and then he made his choice brother bannon even said that about abraham he made his choice but he was after he made his choice he was accepted by god then he could stand in the gap to actually intercede joseph this is a strange one joseph takes a unlikely pathway of intercession now this is what i want you to kind of key in on because this is where i think it's a little different in order to actually intercede you have to feel for the people you cannot intercede unless you can feel the pain that they're feeling you understand that there is conditions for intercession just because you know you're in the position do you realize you can't actually help them unless you can feel their pain brother branham talks about this you can't do a thing to help them if you can't feel the pain they're in and sympathize with the situation they find themselves in i have found myself in that position many times out at restaurants and you know my i have a tendency to talk to people but i have a tendency to talk to them because i think as long as they got breath in their body there could be a chance there's something i can say there's something i can do there's some expression that they can see in my life that could be mercy to them but you just cannot help anybody if you don't feel for them you just cannot do it guys no one can so joseph it's fine it's an interesting pathway he takes to get to the throne in order to actually intercede on his brethren on behalf of his brother he's loved over the father we know that so he's clearly chosen the father chose to love him he's hated of his brethren he's totally rejected because he's spiritual he dreams dreams and he has revelations of things that his brothers have no clue what they're talking about and for some reason seemingly those revelations and dreams seem to put him in a position they don't exactly like and so he's having these dreams he's chosen so then he is now rejected of his brethren because he's spiritual and he's been called of god to fulfill a certain purpose and plan and then he's cast into the pit then he's thrown into slavery he finds himself in the middle of a prison so he's finding himself in an unlikely not so fun place of suffering and none of this ever does anything other than soften his heart for his brethren because when his brethren finally come in his presence he can barely hold back the tears in order to be able to show and express his great love to him he just hardly can't contain it he wasn't angry he wasn't upset he wasn't saying i got you now he wasn't had that attitude ever in him he had an attitude of wanting to restore fellowship with his brethren all the way through and it's interesting because that's the nature of christ in every situation we find ourselves in what would have happened if stephen would not have said father forgive them they know not what they do because there was a predestinated elect first church age messenger standing there at the feet with their stephen's coat being thrown and he didn't know what he was doing here was the elect of god persecuting the elect and here's stephen not getting a bad attitude about it but he's saying father forgive them they know not what they do because this elect can't persecute this elect can't blaspheme because he's the elect but he did not know what he was doing he could not recognize the manifestation of christ in stephen at that moment but he would at a later date and time if that ever isn't a rebuke and a warning to each and every one of us just because someone doesn't see things the way we see it in the hour in which we see it hold your peace pray for him don't say anything against him ask for mercy ask for forgiveness keep an arm open out there stretched out constantly doing something that you can maybe bring them back into fellowship at a later date and time you pray for them don't condemn them because even paul couldn't recognize this great unfailing and so it just keeps on going up through then in brother branham's life he does the same thing obviously clearly chosen obviously clearly makes his choice then obviously once wants to leave the ministry because he's been rejected but he realizes i'll let so many people lay sick and then later on because of his rejection he throws himself in the breach interceding on behalf of the people and so much so brother branham tells his story and i want to get to this if that's okay and i'm just bouncing around i apologize got a headache so i'll be all over the place brother branham tells this story you all of which you know very well and the reason why i'm saying this you have to be this will say it blind bartimaeus this is when the brother band began to condemn this woman that he found in this restaurant this poor old thing blue looking hair was all over the place little bitty short clothes on a man any man would be ashamed to have on and he looked and she was drunk he looked all around oh mercy i thought god have mercy have you you've been how can you being so holy and righteous ever look upon a thing such as that looks like you would just have to smite the thing off does a little my my little sarah rebecca have to be raised up in such as this and two men excuse themselves and walked out in a few minutes i was standing there looking at a woman criticizing her with all that was within me thinking what a horrible thing but many times we should not do that we don't know what's the what's the inside story and it happened to be god taught me a lesson right here i stepped back behind the door and something said move back and when i knelt down to pray i looked and i saw a vision of the world turning it looked like crimson spray around it and i seen myself as it as i was first standing on the earth and every time i would do something wrong my sins would start up to god but jesus act as a bumper to to keep me my sins from getting to god and every time i would do something wrong then i looked like that my sins would go up towards god but jesus would catch it and i'd see tears running off of his cheeks and blood running off of his face he'd look up and say father he doesn't know what he's doing forgiving and i thought is that my sins doing that and i went up close to him i looked and there was a book laying open and my sins were were awful on it and i said dear lord jesus you mean that my sins have hurt your sides and made tears in your eyes and blood on your face he said it is i said please forgive me and he touched his side and wrote across the book pardoned and he throwed it behind him i said oh i'll ever be grateful to you and when he did he said i forgive you but you want to condemn her. and when he did that i was looking back at that woman again i walked over to where she was and i said how do you do she was drinking quite extensively and i said she looked up at me and she said oh how do you do i said could i sit down she said oh i've got company and i said not like that i want to tell you something and i sat down and told her and i looked at her and she started crying i said aren't you shane she said who are you are you that minister down there at the armory i said yes ma'am i'm brother branham she said i'm ashamed to face you brother branham she said my father's a methodist minister and i've got two daughters and one of them's a renowned christian the other one's a sunday school teacher she told me the story of her drunken husband and what and what she started she said there's no hopes for me i said if there is no hopes for you why did why did god just show me that vision and then i took her by the hand and i knelt down beside her at at the booth and led her to the lord jesus right there in that room when we got up the policeman was standing there and the girl was standing back there crying you see it made a difference and it you see you must look at things in the right way that you may know the story that's behind it you all know that story but i read that story because brother branham wants to condemn this woman he wants to bring judgment he wants to see judgment come upon this earth and upon this woman until god reminds him that every one of your sins is smacking jesus in the face is bringing blood to him and it's our sins on a daily basis that keeps us in a position where it ought to be allowing you to stay in an intercessory position if you understand what he's doing for you every single day it doesn't put you in a position where you're saying i'm good i'm out let the rest of you guys go the way they go no there's got to be a bride that throws himself in the breach here at the end time and it says this is a purpose i've come to this place for a purpose i've got a job to do there's breath in their body there's breath in mind and i just so happen to have access to the throne of god so i can actually do something to intercede on their behalf you see you have to feel for the people if you want to intercede i can say you're here to intercede but do you realize you have to feel the pain that they feel you have to be able to identify with them you have to be able to say you know what i don't know the story i don't know how they got to this position but you know what let me see if i can find out maybe i can do something we live in our own world we want to do our own things and you forgot your divine purpose this is the greatest expression of divine love the world has ever seen god is literally breaking himself up putting himself in many membered bride and allowing them to stay in the most humble simple positions as a farmer as a mechanic as a factory worker as a housewife he he's literally breaking himself up putting himself in common vessels to go reach people who's going to reach him how's god going to how's how they going to come to church how are they going to hear a sermon preached so god's going out to him he's literally breaking himself up this is the most supernatural display of mercy i could have ever imagined god literally tabernacling himself in common everyday individuals so that they can go as little secret weapons you could say infiltrating the devil's strongholds going to places that no one could ever get to and saying there he is he's working on a factory line and little does the devil know right there's an absolute son and daughter of god there to display god in the fullness of his glory as a consecrated life and now you have factory workers all around saying what is it about that person i just don't understand it you see he pulled one over he really pulled one over and then now what you have is you have this beauty you have this this people of god that are content in the state that they find themselves in they're content being the factory worker they're content being the mechanic they're content being the farmer they're content and being that which god went to great efforts to make so that they can stay right there in that position and glorify god and do the work that he left for you to do it's the most amazing thing if you think about it it's very common and very simple but wow it's pretty awesome it gives you some it just does something to you and i when i had shared this last week or the week prior to the kids because i feel now it fits is this fellowship of his sufferings paul said in philippians he said to be found in him not having mine own righteous which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death this is not exactly the pathway that i would like to choose in life but you realize you cannot even know him unless you you know god wants fellowship right so in order to have fellowship god became man so he could taste what sickness is taste pain taste rejection taste sorrow so he can understand you but then so that you can understand him god now puts you in the position as an intercessor god be it's the becoming god god becoming man you becoming god for fellowship so now he came down to earthly flesh to understand you now you're ascending to heavenly places as his representatives on earth so you can understand him this is beautiful this is beautiful brother braham says it right here he says now notice the threefold purpose manifest himself in jesus christ to to come unto the body by jesus christ to have the preeminences to restore back eden bring back that which is lost that only thing out of order and all the rest of his things was in order but he had to put man on a free moral agency so he could fall so that he might be a savior to display what was in him so his attribute of savior something had to be lost and the very thing that man fell and became lost he become the savior of that taking his own law that he could not do it as the great jehovah that covered all space and time he couldn't do it and he had to become a man and he took kinship that with a man that was lost amen because a man god made flesh hallelujah i get excited to think about it something on the inside god became from god to become man to take my sin upon him that he might make me him amen back to his great purpose of sons and daughters of god for he is the eternal father god went to great efforts to become man now he's going to great efforts to make man god dude hard to say but truth that's exactly what he's doing so now it's kind of important to remember your divine purpose because now it's god manifested in the flesh of you and me each and every day going to work staying at home as a mom displaying at the grocery store displaying it wherever the pantry i don't know wherever you go there's your pulpit i had a conversation with the missionary yesterday and loved the brother and he said you know really no one's traveling anymore i said it's probably a good thing now they can stop being so busy that they actually have to display christ in the life they live in every day living they'll actually have to be considerate in the fact the realization that their missionary field was the place that god placed them 99 of whatever they do in the world of missions will be right where they're living and the expressions at work and the expressions at the grocery store the expressions of the man that cut you off on the way from home this amazing thing pretty simple pretty common pretty much like isaiah 53 no beauty that we should behold it but are you content in that i'm finding myself to be very very relaxed and content in just being what god called me and made me to be i'm finding it's bringing a different level of rest just something i'm relaxing myself into relaxing myself into the fact that he's went to great efforts to build me make me a certain way now wherever i go god is on the move i know it i'm humbled by it but that's what he said he was going to do i'm not looking at my great merit or any great abilities that i have none of us do but you're looking what he did for you now that's supernatural i like to continue this feeling because i want you to understand you have to feel you have to feel for the people you cannot intercede you cannot help anybody unless you can feel for them brother branham says in re fellowship by redemption 1955 quit your formal worship and get into fellowship with him once stop just going to church on sunday and wednesday and then praying your little prayer every night before you go to bed and really get out there into a fellowship why you'll hurry up and you'll wash the dishes just to get some fellowship again you'll be reading your bible and talking to him that's what we need that's what the world needs today christian friends that's what we need that's what i need that's what this whole world needs is back to a fellowship with him paul said the fellowship of his sufferings bearing the persecutions with him you know paul was a he was a man who'd suffered with christ and when that slave over there had run away paul had borne so much persecution so many things for christ to win that that runaway slave paul said wrote back to his master and said now after that slave has been converted don't treat him like a slave anymore you treat him like a brother said he owes you nothing if he does charge it to my account when i come i'll pray i'll pay you see he had been in the fellowship with christ and his sufferings till he knowed what it meant to be an outcast do you know what it means to be an outcast you know what it was to fellowship in his sufferings see paul knew and could sympathize with others and brother branham said that this was the key to his ministry it was his ability to sympathize and love people so many times we think that the our ministry is really going to get good or we're really going to have something we can display to god if we just figure things out a little bit more you know the greatest expression of of the power of god in your life would be to divinely love someone who does not love you i mean why does he seemingly bring it down to the most simple thing can you love the unlovely can you be outcast and still extend an arm of forgiveness can you be rejected despised and made fun of and still go to a cross for them i mean if you cannot do those things then you've missed the revelation of this whole thing to begin with something has missed it you've totally missed the whole purpose of the seventh seal mystery secret was it was christ in you displaying the attribute of christ his life of intercession and constant intercession on behalf of others you realize that brother branham even says this is why we have so much division you know why we have so much division because they don't understand what this is all about god is known in simplicity it's a revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person it is not a theology it is a revelation of jesus christ and it's upon this rock i'll build my church no other rocks are accepted no other things will be accepted no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school no nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through a new birth he he's born there and he injects his own life in there and your life is gone and the life of christ is now projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people that when they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it is not even called to it god's great revelation is unfolding by the lack of this revelation is why we have so many divisions among us and it is such a mockery so much division among us is because the people lack that revelation see they lack the revelation they do not understand what it is no ability to understand causes you to constantly criticize a lack of the revelation of christ and you unveiling itself is why you constantly need to criticize and constantly condemn others that don't see things the way you do it a lack of the revelation i think god i think we need to pray for more revelation of what actually our position in life is and why did christ call us why did he unveil his son not only to us but through us what's it all about remember remember your divine purpose remember your divine calling because without that sincere love and sympathy for somebody else you can't even display the great mystery revelation of christ so maybe just maybe god may foreordain a very difficult path for you a very difficult path of suffering and rejection and constant outcastness just so that you can display that mystery of christ that he wanted displayed in you you ever think of it like in order and because this is god became man now it's man becoming god in order to know him as one who would go to a cross and say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing it must be that i must find myself in the same position being spit at stoned ridiculed mocked and rejected and still have the heart of christ inside of me expressing father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they can't see it surely if they understood what it was that you were and what you were in me they would never ever do the things they're doing they certainly wouldn't do it they just wouldn't do it and see i think we lack that revelation and i think that's what happens to so many churches they lack the revelation of the mystery of actually what christ the mystery of god was saying this is why they feel a need to criticize mock and ridicule even other churches that don't see things the way they do just stop it they have to do that that's for a purpose you know paul had to do the things he do it was for a purpose it served god's purpose everybody is serving god's purpose they have a job to do and i got mine so we don't have to worry about it you ever think about that you're on the job working on a line you don't concern yourself with the other man down the road hey you know is he doing his job no you worry about yourself i've had to correct employers employees over time because they always want to tell me about what somebody else is not doing i says my friend you're not even doing what you're supposed to be doing why don't you do what you're supposed to be doing then we'll talk later you know so let's just be concerned that we're expressing christ in the simplicity that he called us to express it in brother branham says in god projecting his love there was an old man and i began to feel real sorry for him i looked he had an old ragged coat and i put my shoulders up to his and see if my coat would fit him i looked at his feet he had no shoes he had great calluses all over his feet he's dusty all over the place where his ragged trouser leg my shoe wasn't nothing big enough for him i began to look and i thought this poor old man never even had a good meal probably in his life all the ex economics of mexico was so poor the brick mason gets only about eight pesos a day he takes it about it gets it about four days of hard work to buy himself a pair of shoes and and i thought after all that then the nature the devil had given him evil to blind this poor man how cruel it was to him and i began to enter into something i can't express it it was a love it was a sympathy sympathy and this old fellow come and laid his head over on my shoulder and i hugged that old rugged coat and i said merciful god help this poor blind daddy if my dad would have lived he'd have been about this age will you help him and i heard him hollering glory adios and the man could see as good as i could and the beginning the people began screaming and everything what was it i was entering into the fellowship of his sufferings with his blindness you must do it and if ever i've had a success in praying for anyone is when i could enter into a fellowship with them and feel their infirmities and feel their conditions then something in you goes beyond all reasonings and prays a prayer of faith for the sick you've got to feel for a man you've got to sympathize with him you've got to get him before you before you can help me then you enter into some sort of a deepness it's a love of god and it goes beyond all human love i'm gonna tell you something you may class me as a fanatic but i feel like that i feel like i want to tell you anyhow many times like that frankly all my ministry has been wrapped up in that one thing if i can love them and sympathize with them long way of saying you can't help nobody unless you can feel their infirmities the key to brother branham's ministry and displaying divine love was to be able to identify you know what maybe i don't know the whole story maybe i shouldn't be so quick to condemn maybe they just don't understand maybe had a harder way but maybe god also ordained me to be able to come into contact with him because there's probably nobody else in this room that would ever sympathize with this one but i could sympathize with him i could put my arm around him i could help him i believe god's training a very elite humble group of people that actually feel what he feels understands what he understands because how else could he have ever done what he had done how else could he have done it unless he knew that he was restoring fellowship and if there's one thing i want to do i want to restore fellowship i want to restore fellowship between god and man with as many people as i possibly can do so while i'm in this earth i've got a job to do and i'm going to continue to do it though our eagle eye could get very filmed over and it all happens to each and every one of us i'm included but one thing's for sure i certainly don't want to leave my post of duty and forget why i came here god had a job for me to do i was sitting after i spoke this to the youth there on sunday i callie and i were she was going to bed and i just started talking to her i said honey i want you to know something right now you identify as callian the daughter of kyle and carrie wiker but one day my prayer is gee that you'll know you're a daughter of almighty god you had a divine purpose that you're on this earth for to fulfill and right now you don't know that but one day i believe you will and when you do you can fulfill what god called you to this earth for and i just began to explain to her just as simple as i know how you've got a divine purpose everything's for a reason whatever state you find yourself in be content god got you there for a reason don't up get upset don't be frustrated don't complain god's got you there for a reason relax and just trust that god's going to express his great purpose of his will in you through even suffering and rejection brother brown says this morning before i had gotten up i was talking to my wife i said honey couldn't be possible i'm this old it just looks like the years keep slipping by real quick i said but you know i was born in this world for some purpose and i believe that that's to serve god and that is my heart's desire what i would ask of you would be that you would be praying for me when you lay down tonight that god would keep me humble in my heart and he would help me and bless me so that i can be a blessing to you people i find out that the greatest blessing in all of life is giving out not receiving in but giving out you see what you do for others will mean so much living your life for others that was the purpose from the beginning if you will turn into colossians 3 12. um paul says here put therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bows of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness and longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against you even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness you see you have to realize you've been forgiven of much in order for you to forgive you have to realize you were in great need sometimes the devil would like to lift you up and make you little prideful think you're something a little more special than what you are you're the grace of god you are special but don't forget what made you special was the grace of god choosing he chose you from before the foundation of the world and now he's revealing himself in and through you that's what makes you so special that's what puts you in a position because you have to be in the right position and actually in order to intercede for somebody else musicians will you come i'm sorry i can tell my voice is already going out so i think i've made my point god bless you why don't you stand with me i am reminded of the bride the third pole ministry that was displayed in sister hattie wright as she said the right thing and preached on that a while ago she said the right thing at the right time in the presence of the right person and because she could she was the right person literally and figuratively the right woman and she said the right thing that so pleased him she had the opportunity to deliver herself from the sufferings that she was in brother bam said if she'd ask for a million dollars he'd give it healing he'd give it whatever but she never asked for any of that she didn't ask for an easier life she then asked for anything that would lessen the pain of her family and you know make life easier she interceded on behalf of her two sons if she could ask for anything there was in the whole world brother brown said he'd have given it to her anything it did not matter but the one thing she chose the right thing she said the right thing she had her had her opportunity and her opportunity was just the salvation of her two boys that meant everything to her the comforts of this life she wasn't looking to be delivered she just wanted those two boys kind of puts things in reality it's kind of simple sometimes god hides in simplicity why don't you just bow your heads or word a prayer with me heavenly father lord we just come before you now lord i'm so thankful lord and by your grace lord you've allowed me to see and experience the things that i'm seeing lord i i appreciate it so very much it's doing things to me and uh just pray lord god that you would just make us just simple enough and humble enough to be able to see it lord that we could express this great mystery revelation this great secret you had in the back parts of your mind lord god becoming man now man becoming god expressing christ in a reality of everyday living so lord i just pray for the people i lift them up before you i'm not asking that you really make their life more comfortable i'm just asking that you'd be with them in whatever state they find themselves in i pray lord that you could give each person a clear revelation of why they are in the position they're in why they are what they are why they have contact with the people they have contact with because it's it's a great purpose a divine purpose lord and a great thing that you've desired to express in them a little secret lord i pray that you would continually unfold this revelation to us as individuals so that we can be the expression of your desire lord bless our beloved pastor his wife the children lord may they enjoy themselves and lord you please return them to us again we sure love them lord i just pray for the ministers that are coming whether ron or the kadima father anoint them and bless them lord may they be able to get out of the way so that you can just speak those words that we are so needful to hear we love you we commit ourselves to you afresh forgive us lord if we've found ourselves as ones that we're condemning forgive us lord may we realize the power of life and deaths in the tongue may we look at every situation as an opportunity for your life to be expressed help us father we pray we love you we thank you we commit this day in our lives into your hands for the glory of god in jesus name amen amen god bless you i'm not going to put you through a squeaky voice i get you out early be praying for you you understand what i'm saying and i believe that that was just what he wanted said that's all i can say i not long not highly detailed but i think you get the point and i think maybe you walk away with a little bit clearer understanding why you're maybe experiencing the things you're experiencing why you may have the friends you have maybe you have some wretched friends like joe who's going to intercede for him there's a purpose for everything you know all things work together for the good to them that love the lord brother blake you got a song [Music] in my heart from all indians send [Music] to feel your compassion with your team oh [Applause] oh [Music] [Music]
