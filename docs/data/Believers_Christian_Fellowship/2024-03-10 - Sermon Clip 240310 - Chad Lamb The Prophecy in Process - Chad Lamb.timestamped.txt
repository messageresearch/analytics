[0:00] they needed to trust the Lord yes so God
[0:04] would take them through many experiences
[0:06] in the 40-year journey and they would go
[0:08] through the bitter Waters that were
[0:11] turned
[0:12] sweet they would they would they would
[0:15] see the failure of
[0:17] ministry when Aaron pushed by the people
[0:21] took them back to idolatry yes they saw
[0:24] the failure of Moses when he exalted
[0:26] himself when he became angry and was
[0:28] withheld from The Promised Land
[0:31] they saw uh the the anger of the Lord in
[0:34] judgment when they when they when they
[0:37] complained against the Lord and he sent
[0:39] fiery serpents among them but then they
[0:42] saw the salvation of the Lord when he
[0:43] provided a Brazen
[0:47] serpent when they cried for quail he
[0:50] provided when they were attacked by
[0:51] enemies he defeated
[0:54] them all this
[0:57] journey it was all doing something
[1:00] something it was all building something
[1:03] it was molding something everything they
[1:05] go went through there was a new
[1:07] generation coming up what was happening
[1:09] the the the the the thinking of Egypt
[1:13] the slave mentality the thing they've
[1:15] been bound in It's Beginning to leave
[1:17] circumstance by circumstance by
[1:20] circumstance until you find people who
[1:22] hit a hardship they want to go right
[1:24] back to Egypt because at least we had
[1:25] something to eat at Egypt and now you
[1:27] come to a new generation it comes up and
[1:29] there sharpening swords and they can't
[1:31] wait to go into the promised
[1:33] land what happened there was something
[1:36] there was a prophecy in process but the
[1:38] process was doing something it was
[1:40] preparing a people to step into the
[1:42] furtherment of the
[1:45] prophecy we've been in a prophecy and
[1:47] process for 60 plus years now but what
[1:50] God been doing he's been doing all the
[1:51] same things he did in the Exodus Journey
[1:54] we've seen all of those things and those
[1:57] of you who've been around longer than
[1:58] I've been around you've seen them all
[2:00] you've seen the failure of ministry
[2:01] you've seen Ministry exalt themselves
[2:02] you've seen Ministry given to the ons of
[2:04] the people you've seen people complain
[2:06] you've seen people turn
[2:08] back you've seen the Judgment of God and
[2:10] you've seen the mercy of God you've seen
[2:13] the provision of God you've seen fear
[2:15] that comes when an enemy comes and
[2:16] you've seen God raise up some in the
[2:18] camp to defeat the enemy you've seen
[2:21] you've seen Rebellion against god- giv
[2:23] Authority and what happens to
[2:28] them who's been around for a while have
[2:31] you seen those
[2:35] things what was it well we thought it
[2:38] was
[2:40] time we thought that he had come we
[2:43] thought it was the
[2:45] Rapture but now it's been 60
[2:49] years no this is still the
[2:52] Rapture this is still the coming of the
[2:54] Lord he's coming in Bride form he's
[2:57] still coming to Greater manifestation
[2:59] all that time as what as we travel
[3:01] through all of this we're still smack
[3:03] dab in the middle of the prophecy
[3:05] friends we're not waiting we're here we
[3:08] say coming yeah there's more to be
[3:10] fulfilled but what's being fulfilled is
[3:12] happening right now day by day all
[3:14] around us
