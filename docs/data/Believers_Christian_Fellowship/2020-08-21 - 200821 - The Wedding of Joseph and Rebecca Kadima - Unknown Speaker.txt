lord you before the foundation of the world had declared that this moment this would take place and we are just yielding to your will now as we've declared the intent and purpose for which we've gathered we as family and friends and guests have gathered to lend our support to this holy union we pray now god you would bless this ceremony and all the symbology that's involved may you be glorified and we bring honor into your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen and friends a wedding is more for christians than just uh adjoining of two people it's a symbolism of the meaning and purpose of the entire bible the whole plan of god has unfolded in the union of christ and his bride so for us this event is is exciting it's it's enjoyable it's fun to see our brother joseph and her sister rebecca come together under god's plan and god's perfect time and his will being fulfilled in their lives but as they stand here being joined together it reminds us of the scriptures it reminds us of the purpose and intent of god in marriage for it was god who instituted the first marriage before there was a church there was marriage before there was houses of worship there was marriage before there was forms in order to worship there was marriage before preachers marriage before schools marriage before anything there was marriage so what do you think is the most important to god amen i'd like to read out of genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and again he says in genesis 5 1 this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created god declares here that he made man in his own image but the next line says male and female created he them so now we get a picture of the image of god the image of god was expressed in male and female and when god had made male he made the adam within adam was his bride amen and we see just like within christ we were in christ but at the point in time for adam's wife to come forth for his bride god had to lay him down put him to sleep and he had to wound him in the side and take from his side what he would use to form his bride and unite the two back together showing clearly what god was going to do in the future when he would take his son and he would wound him in the side he'd lay him to sleep and take something from him and out of that he would build a bride and present that bride that wife back to his son this in the scriptures in acts chapter 15 verse 18 he says known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world so god is not figuring out what he'll do next known to god or all his works from the beginning of the world so when god began to do something he knew where he was going to go he knew what his intention was he knew where he was going to get to at the end of time and everything god's been doing has been building to get to the purpose that he purposed in all things isaiah explains it this way in chapter 46 remember the former things of old for i am god and there's none else i am god and there's none like me declaring the end from the beginning so god was declaring the end from the beginning so what he did in the beginning will declare what he intends to do in the end declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure. so if we want to know what god will do let's look at what he did in the beginning because he declared the end from the beginning and even jesus he's asked a question about marriage and it's a question concerning divorce and when jesus answers the question he's got to point them to the right place so they'll understand the answer to the question and they asked him and then jesus responds says the pharisees also came to him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let no man put a sun there so when jesus answers the question jesus has to take him back to the beginning because if you understand the beginning you understand what god will do what he wanted to do what he has done is what he'll do again and the answer lies in the beginning what will god do next what is god's purpose what's his plan what's the whole bible about he declared the end from the beginning and everything in between is telling the same story it's god building to his grand conclusion because known unto him are his works from the beginning of the world you're standing here not not just to fulfill your own desire this is part of the plan of god you're here on this date at this time to declare unto us god's original purpose you here today are showing what he's done and you here today are showing what he will do for god's plan was always to have a son and for that son to have a bride and for them to be united together and be placed in a perfect place on the earth to live in harmony in love to display the very nature of god and you today are reminding us of that great purpose god when he had that when jesus christ was here god in flesh he had to answer the question and to answer the question he put him back in the beginning and so god at the end of time has sent us a great prophet and that prophet also took us back to the beginning so we would understand so we'd have no misunderstanding and that prophet of god said this and if you will if you'll notice how that eve was united with adam she became part of him god did you notice in genesis 1 27 he created male men male and female created thee them now the man was both male and female when it came to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then god took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took from the side of adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of adam for he was both male and man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and finished so when god was looking for a wife for adam the solution to his problem was found in adam and when god is looking for a bride for christ the solution is already in christ genesis 2 we'll go back to genesis 2 and we'll read to this account genesis 2 and 18 and the lord god said it is not good that man shall be alone i will make him a help meet for him if you look at this word help me it's more than just a helper it's a help meet and this word meet in the original means suitable a suitable help not just a help but a suitable help on this suitable help means one that is like so in order to be a suitable help she had to be like adam so let's read the rest of the story and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet a suitable help and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and the day god created them he created man in his own image male and female created he them and called their name adam they only had one name because they were really two opposite reflections of one person it was adam male and female god was showing from the beginning what he would do in the end because in the end there's going to be one christ male and female one jesus christ and his bride a mini-membrane body prophet of god says this he said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it never will end see it's eternal and when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds the man she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and they stepped out into space of time and will return back to eternity eternity has dropped in a body called time then it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish so if you love him and you can't really explain why and if you love her and you can't really explain why you may have tried to use words but the words somehow were never fitting to the feeling the feeling runs deeper you guys are not here just because of your own desire you're not here just because of your own purpose or for your own pleasure but there's something else if you're a child of god there's something else moving you motivating you there's a love that's hard to express a love that's hard to explain because that love came from the eternal and is eternal it will never die that's what your marriage is based on the eternal purpose of god not the temporal plans and purposes and desires of a man and woman but the eternal purpose of god you today are showing us what took place in the garden but you're showing us more than that you're showing us what's taking place now in the day we live as christ is uniting with his bride in an invisible union and all of that invisible union will be made manifest one day upon this earth when christ takes the throne of his father david and rules and reigns and we as his bride are on earth with him restored back to eden see from the beginning he declared the end god knew when he made adam and eve he knew what what his objective was he knew what his goal was when he wrote the old testament he knew christ was coming and christ was the fulfillment of all the prophecies when he allowed the new testament to roll on through seven church ages he knew what was coming god wasn't taking in surprise he wasn't adding to his knowledge he wasn't changing his ideas with time he knew exactly where he was getting to and he was getting to that grand union of christ and his bride and back on the earth again we read from the beginning of the book in genesis what god's original intent what he did in the beginning now let's read a couple scriptures from the end of the book from book revelation from the book of revelations and we will all see that he declared the end from the beginning because the book of revelation ends in the last couple of chapters revelation 19 6 says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready then again in revelations 21 9 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god this is how the story finishes it was declared from how the story began god will have a bride for the lamb if the lamb has to have a bride like adam had to have a bride what kind of bride did adam have he had to have a suitable bride or one that was like in and had to come from him if the lamb will have a bride he also must have a suitable bride so if there's going to be a mr lamb there has to be a mrs lamb there's a mister christ there have to be a mrs christ right he declared the end from the beginning so i charge you both brother joseph sister rebecca i charge you to keep the image pure to labor and strive to not let the antichrist spirit come in no bitterness no strife reconcile stay one stay in harmony with one another fight the evil spirits that'll try to ruin this image that god is establishing today because you're declaring more than your intent you're declaring god's intent you're showing us today what has been and what will be continue to show every day of your life what has been and what will be and let nothing come in between amen we're going to move to the vows now brother joseph i'm going to ask for you to repeat after me i joseph take thee rebecca hi joseph take thee
