[0:00] So here we've got the the earth spinning
[0:03] so that we get day day and night just as
[0:05] the Lord wants it. But the earth is
[0:08] orbiting around the sun once a year.
[0:10] Every 365 and a/4 days we go right
[0:13] around the sun. And we call that a year.
[0:16] But to do that we've got to be traveling
[0:18] at the speed of 67,000 m an hour. And
[0:22] that's what we're doing. You're sitting
[0:24] right here feeling like you're sitting
[0:26] still, but you're actually moving around
[0:27] the sun at 67,000 mph. That's 19 miles
[0:32] every second.
[0:35] So, but it's a lot more complicated than
[0:37] that because the sun, our sun and our
[0:41] whole solar system is also orbiting the
[0:44] center of our of the Milky Way and it's
[0:48] going round the Milky Way every 230
[0:50] million years. we do a galactic year, an
[0:54] orbit of the of the center of our uh
[0:57] Milky Way galaxy. But to do that, we
[0:59] have to be traveling at 514,000
[1:03] m an hour,
[1:05] which is 143 miles every second. But
[1:09] since the whole of our solar system is
[1:12] racing through space, so we just kind of
[1:14] think the sun's here and the Earth's
[1:15] going around it and the other planets
[1:17] like, but it's not like that. It's
[1:18] racing through space and all these other
[1:20] things are keeping up with it, circling
[1:22] around it. But it's a lot more
[1:24] complicated than that because our entire
[1:27] galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, is
[1:30] hurtling through space at a speed of 1.3
[1:35] million miles hour. So, while we're
[1:39] sitting here, every second we've done
[1:41] 361 miles.
[1:46] But to set that all in order that it all
[1:48] works in perfect harmony, it takes an
[1:51] infinite mind. Amen.
[1:54] He had to plan it all. If we had
[1:56] infinite power and you wanted to put one
[1:59] planet in orbit around a star, you
[2:02] wouldn't be able to do it unless you
[2:03] also had the infinite mind. If you had
[2:06] infinite power to do it, you'd still
[2:08] need an infinite mind. And every
[2:10] satellite, there's thousands and
[2:11] thousands of satellites that man has put
[2:13] up around the earth. There's not one of
[2:15] them that's in a stable orbit. Not one.
[2:18] Every single one of them has to be
[2:19] adjusted continuously to keep it in
[2:22] orbit because it's it's being influenced
[2:24] by all the other planets, being
[2:25] influenced by the moon. It's being being
[2:27] influenced uh by everything else that's
[2:29] out there in space. It keeps putting it
[2:31] out of its orbit. So, they have to keep
[2:32] driving it back into to keep it in a
[2:34] circular orbit. So, uh it's complicated.
[2:38] And I think the way that David said in
[2:40] the Psalms, "Great is our Lord and of
[2:42] great power. His understanding is
[2:44] infinite. Amen. That sums it up.
