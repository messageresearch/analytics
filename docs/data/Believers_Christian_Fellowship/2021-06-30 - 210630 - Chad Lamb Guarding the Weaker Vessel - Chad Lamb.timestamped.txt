[7:38] amen and while we're standing let's take
[7:40] our bibles and turn to genesis
[7:44] chapter 2.
[7:47] i'm going to continue with the thought
[7:50] we were on
[7:50] but i'd like to call this this evening
[7:53] guarding the weaker vessel
[7:55] guarding the weaker vessel
[7:58] i've had a few quests somebody
[8:00] questioned me about
[8:02] this sunday communion service because
[8:04] it's the fourth but we will be having
[8:05] communion service as usual
[8:07] for anybody who's able to make it would
[8:08] like to stay for community service so
[8:10] you can plan on that
[8:12] as normal let's look at genesis chapter
[8:15] 2
[8:16] verse 21
[8:21] and the lord god caused the deep sleep
[8:23] to fall upon adam
[8:24] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[8:26] and closed up the flesh instead thereof
[8:29] and the rib which the lord god had taken
[8:31] from man
[8:32] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[8:34] man
[8:35] and adam said this is now bone of my
[8:37] bones and flesh in my flesh
[8:39] she shall be called woman because she
[8:40] was taken out of man
[8:43] therefore shall a man leave his father
[8:45] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[8:47] wife
[8:48] and they shall be one flesh amen
[8:51] you may be seated may the lord add the
[8:53] blessing to the reading of his word and
[8:55] may he open his word to us this is the
[8:58] scripture that we started with last time
[9:00] as we were
[9:01] seeing and demonstrating and showing
[9:02] through the scripture
[9:04] that the woman was made differently than
[9:07] the rest of creation as god brought
[9:08] forth creation he brought forth creation
[9:10] a certain way
[9:11] but when he came to this to when he came
[9:14] to this woman when he was making a wife
[9:16] or a son
[9:17] he the wife was in the sun and he pulled
[9:20] her out and he did it differently
[9:22] than he made everything else and there
[9:23] was a reason why he did that
[9:25] and so i just want to refresh our memory
[9:27] and read these two quotes together
[9:29] in invisible union brother branham says
[9:32] when you see the woman
[9:33] a byproduct not another female like her
[9:36] made in that order
[9:37] knowing that she could be deceived god
[9:39] knowed if he didn't know the end from
[9:41] the beginning
[9:42] then he wasn't god if he is an infinite
[9:45] if he can't be infinite without being
[9:47] omniscient
[9:48] omnipresent knowing all things eternal
[9:50] so he knowed all things and he had to
[9:52] make that woman
[9:54] you the man didn't have a wife the wife
[9:57] and the man was the same thing
[9:58] he had the feminist and masculine spirit
[10:01] and himself
[10:02] he had to separate take a byproduct
[10:04] after the whole creation made
[10:06] no female created by god and the
[10:08] original creation can do a thing like
[10:10] that
[10:10] she was made thus to do it he knowed she
[10:13] would do it
[10:14] if he didn't he wasn't god but see the
[10:17] attributes that's in
[10:18] god had to be displayed oh praise god
[10:22] amen when we look at this god when he's
[10:25] when he's fashioning his creation he's
[10:27] going through creation
[10:28] and he's making everything that he made
[10:31] and all the beasts of the field were
[10:32] coming up the same way and
[10:34] he made him here for adam to find the
[10:36] help meet we went through all of this
[10:38] but we find that there was no suitable
[10:39] help me so god did something different
[10:42] something he hadn't done yet
[10:44] and he pulled out of adam a rib and he
[10:47] formed from that rib
[10:48] the woman and reintroduced her back to
[10:50] the man and those two were one flesh
[10:52] and the reason god did that is because
[10:55] there was attributes locked inside of
[10:57] himself
[10:59] god did that because he had attributes
[11:01] locked inside of himself
[11:02] and those attributes that were locked
[11:04] inside of himself were healer
[11:06] and savior redeemer and all of these
[11:09] things that god wanted to express
[11:11] so in order for god to express it he has
[11:13] to have something
[11:15] like we said before that will open the
[11:17] door
[11:18] so the woman is the woman is
[11:20] instrumental
[11:21] or key to the redemption plan of god and
[11:24] then she has a major part to play in the
[11:27] redemption plan of god
[11:29] and she was made that way well god knew
[11:31] that she would fall
[11:33] he knows she would do it but he he if he
[11:36] didn't he wasn't gone
[11:37] but see the attributes that's in god
[11:39] that's in god
[11:40] had to be displayed so how's he going to
[11:43] display it
[11:44] if nothing will fall then all of these
[11:46] things he's locked inside of him these
[11:48] attributes these characteristics can't
[11:50] be displayed
[11:51] so god took from adam made a byproduct
[11:54] amen
[11:55] and she had the ability to fall there
[11:57] was something in her where she could
[11:59] make a choice
[11:59] and open the door to the fall amen so
[12:02] that all that was locked inside of god
[12:04] could come out and be displayed
[12:06] so we know she was a weaker vessel
[12:08] because she was made this
[12:10] being made this way made her the weaker
[12:12] vessel
[12:13] but she has made a weaker vessel for a
[12:15] purpose according to the plan of god
[12:17] and because god has equity in all things
[12:20] because she was used to open the door to
[12:23] the fall
[12:24] so the attributes of god could flood out
[12:26] god would take this very same vessel of
[12:28] a woman
[12:29] and from her would bring forth a seed
[12:31] amen and that would be christ amen the
[12:33] redeemer
[12:34] so she is tied to redemption
[12:38] this woman you see the attributes that's
[12:40] in god
[12:41] had to be displayed he has to be a
[12:43] savior and to make everything perfect
[12:45] the way he had it
[12:46] then there could be nothing lost oh
[12:49] don't be children be
[12:50] men and women we're at the end rune
[12:53] brother brandon when he says that
[12:54] he's saying say wake up amen and look at
[12:57] this word that's being revealed
[12:59] we're not taking a bunch of sunday
[13:00] school stories but the word has painted
[13:02] the picture
[13:03] and there's a prophet here in the last
[13:04] day to illuminate this word
[13:06] so we can see what it's all been about
[13:10] amen and we we begin to understand when
[13:12] we begin to understand what happened in
[13:14] the fall and the way god made everything
[13:16] and
[13:16] why the bible is written the way it's
[13:18] written why the woman was constructed
[13:21] differently than every other female was
[13:22] constructed what was the purpose and all
[13:25] that
[13:25] when we begin to see all that oh my
[13:28] goodness the plan of god just begins to
[13:29] unfold right here in genesis
[13:33] it's so exciting in the church age book
[13:36] out of the thythian church age the
[13:37] prophet of god says
[13:39] let us go back to the beginning in the
[13:41] original physical creation as we know it
[13:43] today
[13:44] god made everything in pairs male and
[13:46] female there were two chickens rooster
[13:48] and him
[13:48] there were two cattle the cow and the
[13:50] bull and right down the line
[13:52] but when it come to man there was only
[13:54] one
[13:55] they were not a pair adam had been made
[13:58] the image of god he was a son of god
[14:00] and as soon as as the son of god he
[14:02] could not be tempted and fall that would
[14:04] be impossible
[14:05] so god took a byproduct of a man to
[14:08] cause the fall
[14:10] god didn't cause the fall god can't
[14:12] create a fall and be
[14:13] just but god made her in such a way she
[14:16] could fall by her own free choice
[14:20] woman never stepped fresh from the hand
[14:23] of god as a true product of god
[14:25] she was produced from man and when god
[14:27] caused her to be brought forth from man
[14:30] she was vastly different from the other
[14:32] females he had created
[14:34] she was able to be seduced no other
[14:36] female creation can be immoral
[14:38] but the human female can be touched at
[14:40] almost any time
[14:42] and that weakness in her allowed satan
[14:45] to seduce her by way of the serpent
[14:47] and has brought the woman to a very
[14:49] peculiar position before god
[14:51] and his word she is the type of all
[14:54] things vulgar
[14:55] foul and loathsome on the one hand and
[14:57] on the other hand she is the type of all
[14:59] things clean
[15:00] and beautiful and holy as a receptacle
[15:03] of the spirit and the blessings of god
[15:05] on the one hand she is called the
[15:07] who is drunk with the wine of her
[15:08] fornications
[15:09] on the other she is called the bride of
[15:11] christ on one hand she is called mystery
[15:13] babylon the abomination before god
[15:16] on the other hand she is called new
[15:17] jerusalem our mother
[15:19] on the one hand she is so foul and
[15:22] wicked
[15:22] and lewd that she is similarly cast into
[15:25] the lake of fire as the only fit place
[15:27] for her
[15:28] and on the other hand she is exalted to
[15:30] heaven sharing the very throne of god
[15:33] as the only place befitting such a queen
[15:36] so this weakness that's in this woman
[15:39] the weakness that's implanted there was
[15:41] for a purpose amen
[15:43] but but as we talked about last time we
[15:45] look at
[15:46] we look at this weakness in so many
[15:48] times it's been exploited or
[15:49] misunderstood or misrepresented or
[15:52] misused
[15:52] but god designed her the way he wanted
[15:55] her she wasn't
[15:56] an afterthought so we spent a lot of
[15:58] time talking about this
[15:59] she was an original thought of god but
[16:02] she wasn't made in the original fashion
[16:04] that he made all the other females
[16:07] because
[16:08] he needed think about this he needed
[16:10] this woman
[16:12] he needed her to open the door
[16:16] because god had in him attributes locked
[16:19] so he needed the woman to be able to
[16:21] open the door and when she opened the
[16:23] door
[16:24] it started a process of redemption amen
[16:26] that was going to display
[16:27] all the attributes of god and god was
[16:29] going to continue to use this woman
[16:32] and now there was going to be a battle a
[16:34] warfare that's going to start
[16:36] over this vessel and the devil now is
[16:38] going to try to always use this woman
[16:42] this is the way he always comes in
[16:44] through this woman
[16:45] remember he he came in even in in
[16:47] solomon's kingdom solomon's a type of
[16:49] christ and
[16:50] solomon wiser than any man and he
[16:52] established the golden age the
[16:54] type of the millennium for israel but
[16:56] what was it that caused the fall of
[16:58] solomon
[16:59] it was his wives amen because the devil
[17:01] always comes in through the woman is
[17:04] that true
[17:05] so he was told don't marry these women
[17:08] they'll lead your heart away
[17:09] don't marry the women when you come into
[17:11] the land unless they cause you to serve
[17:12] other gods
[17:13] but solomon and knowledge of his wisdom
[17:15] he ignored that commandment
[17:17] and he went and he multiplied to himself
[17:18] wives and exactly what the scripture
[17:21] said is exactly what happened to him
[17:23] and and and the devil used the woman but
[17:26] the devil's using the woman
[17:28] and god is going to use the woman it
[17:30] depends on what the woman yields herself
[17:33] to
[17:34] they're going to use the same instrument
[17:36] the devil is trying to use the woman to
[17:38] bring about his eden
[17:40] amen and god is going to use the woman
[17:42] to collapse his eden
[17:45] making her very peculiar she has a very
[17:48] peculiar position
[17:51] let's look at genesis chapter 3
[17:55] and verse 16.
[17:59] god now in the judgment he comes down
[18:01] and begins to judge
[18:02] after the fall and he says unto the
[18:04] woman he said i will greatly multiply
[18:06] thy sorrow
[18:07] and thy conception and sorrow shalt thou
[18:09] bring forth children
[18:11] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[18:13] and he shall rule over thee
[18:16] brother has some things to say about
[18:18] this in marriage and divorce he says
[18:20] it was then man was made to rule over
[18:22] the woman by god's word
[18:24] she has no more she was no more co-equal
[18:27] with him
[18:28] she was co-equal in nature you know but
[18:30] when she broke god's word god made man
[18:32] to be a ruler over her
[18:34] genesis 3 16. so now god gives a
[18:37] commandment
[18:38] and he says now your desire shall be to
[18:40] your husband he shall rule over thee
[18:41] brother madam said they were co-equal
[18:43] amen before this in nature but
[18:46] that's that was so that she could fall
[18:50] that was so god's plan could be unlocked
[18:53] so the attributes of god
[18:54] could be unlocked through the fall and
[18:56] so she opened the door but afterwards
[18:59] god is now going to be a protection he's
[19:01] going to bring a protection to this
[19:03] weaker vessel
[19:04] because he made her thus now once she
[19:06] served that purpose and opened the door
[19:09] god is now going to take this woman and
[19:10] put her under the headship of a man
[19:12] not for punishment but for protection
[19:17] amen and when it begins to be viewed as
[19:19] punishment
[19:20] then all of a sudden we've missed the
[19:21] whole purpose of what god is doing we
[19:24] misunderstood something from the very
[19:25] beginning
[19:26] amen and the prophet of god came and
[19:28] explained it to us so well
[19:30] that this woman was made because there
[19:32] was attributes locked in god
[19:34] he needed to make her in such a way that
[19:36] she could make the choice
[19:38] but it was not becoming to him to allow
[19:40] one of his original creations made in
[19:42] the original way to fall that way
[19:44] so he would take a byproduct off the
[19:46] original creation
[19:47] form it and set her there co-equal with
[19:50] the man and she had an opportunity a
[19:52] door
[19:52] a mechanism in which she could open to
[19:55] start the cycle of redemption to release
[19:58] the attributes of god
[20:03] and as soon as she released the
[20:05] attributes of god
[20:07] now that served the purpose in the
[20:10] original
[20:12] and now god comes to the woman and says
[20:15] now your desire shall be your husband he
[20:17] shall rule over you
[20:18] now i'm going to protect you
[20:22] because i made you thus and you've
[20:24] served your purpose
[20:25] now i'm going to protect you and that's
[20:27] why when we get into laodicean
[20:29] with the feminist movement it's a slap
[20:32] in the face of god because they want to
[20:33] come out from under the headship of man
[20:35] and be co-equal or superior in many ways
[20:38] and that whole mentality is rejecting
[20:41] the very purpose by which god made the
[20:43] woman
[20:44] and the protection he placed her under
[20:47] this was
[20:48] god's grace this was god's love to her
[20:51] it was not a punishment and so when a
[20:53] woman wants to move
[20:54] out from the place that god placed her
[20:56] in and moved somewhere else
[20:58] she's rejecting the very word of god and
[21:00] rejecting the love of god
[21:03] because it was the love of god that
[21:04] placed through there so
[21:06] once we we start going through these
[21:08] things and understanding
[21:09] what god did in the original and how god
[21:11] did and how god placed it
[21:13] it takes all the false ideas away
[21:16] and it throws away all man-made
[21:17] understanding and ideas
[21:19] about headship and submission and throws
[21:21] them out completely out
[21:23] and brings it right back to god's
[21:24] original intention like i told you
[21:27] before
[21:27] i always want to know the why behind the
[21:29] why behind the why
[21:31] amen god didn't just say oh you know you
[21:33] messed up now now you're under this man
[21:35] and he's going to be the king and you're
[21:37] going to be the subservient one that
[21:38] wasn't god's picture at all
[21:40] god's picture at all he said i need this
[21:42] woman for redemption purposes i need her
[21:45] i need her to play a certain role i need
[21:47] to fashion her a certain way
[21:48] she's going to unlock my attributes
[21:53] i don't think god was looking at her and
[21:54] saying she's worthless she's no good
[21:56] she's subservient
[21:57] she messed up she's i'm throwing her
[21:59] under the man because i don't like her
[22:01] anymore
[22:02] that wasn't she served exactly her
[22:04] purpose so god said once you served your
[22:06] puppers
[22:06] because i fashioned this way i'm now
[22:08] going to bring a level of protection to
[22:10] you
[22:11] because of the way you're made and when
[22:14] a woman wants to be co-equal with god
[22:16] she absolutely denies the god who made
[22:19] her the way she is
[22:21] thinking co-equal or and superior amen
[22:25] she absolutely
[22:26] is denying what god placed there for a
[22:28] purpose
[22:30] and rejecting the god who created her
[22:34] he said now god made man to be her ruler
[22:37] over her we're still in marriage and
[22:38] divorce genesis 3 16.
[22:40] if you want to put it down she was no
[22:42] more equal with the man
[22:43] she was the breaker of god's word don't
[22:46] you see
[22:46] she she the church down here brother
[22:49] branham is running parallels between the
[22:51] woman at the beginning
[22:52] and the church see the church down here
[22:55] the breaker of god's word
[22:58] that throwed her completely out of
[23:00] continuity and that's why the church has
[23:02] done and throwed spiritual
[23:03] death upon the whole thing now you'll
[23:06] understand why i hammer at these things
[23:08] like i do
[23:08] it's the truth this is bible facts
[23:12] so brother branham is not just hammering
[23:14] at the hammering he's trying to bring us
[23:16] back to the bible
[23:18] let's turn to first corinthians 11.
[23:38] the new testament picks this up we're
[23:40] going to read it out
[23:42] from paul and from peter they continue
[23:45] this same theme on down through
[23:48] because they understand what god has
[23:50] done and they understand why god has
[23:51] done it
[23:52] and in first corinthians chapter 11
[23:54] verse 3 we'll begin with that verse
[23:56] but i would have you know that the head
[23:58] of every man is christ
[24:00] and the head of the woman is the man and
[24:02] the head of christ is god
[24:04] every man praying or prophesying having
[24:06] his head covered dishonor
[24:08] this on earth his head but every woman
[24:10] that prayeth her prophesies with her
[24:12] head
[24:12] uncovered dishonored her head for that
[24:15] is even all one as if she were shaven
[24:17] for if the woman be not covered let her
[24:19] also be shorn
[24:20] but if it be a shame for a woman to be
[24:22] shorn or shaven let her be covered
[24:25] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[24:27] head for as much as he is in the image
[24:29] and glory of god
[24:30] but the woman is the glory of the man
[24:33] see she's made that way she came out of
[24:37] man
[24:38] she is now the glory of man for the man
[24:40] is not of the woman but the woman of the
[24:42] man
[24:42] neither was the man created for the
[24:44] woman but the woman for the man
[24:46] for this cause ought the woman to have
[24:48] power on her head
[24:49] because of the angels this word power is
[24:52] authority she has a sign of authority on
[24:54] her head
[24:55] because of the angels and brother ben
[24:56] says the messengers the men
[25:00] nevertheless neither is the man without
[25:02] the woman neither the woman without the
[25:04] man in the lord
[25:05] for as the woman is of the man even so
[25:07] the man also by the woman
[25:09] but all things of god judging yourselves
[25:12] is it comely that a woman pray unto god
[25:14] uncovered
[25:15] doth not even nature itself teach you
[25:17] that if a man have long hair
[25:18] it is a shame unto him but if a woman
[25:21] have long hair it is her glory to her
[25:23] for her hair is given her for a covering
[25:27] so now the the apostle paul's coming and
[25:29] talking about the headship
[25:31] and when he goes to headship he takes
[25:33] headship and ties it right
[25:35] right to the hair amen this is why when
[25:37] brother branham is preaching on long
[25:39] hair
[25:39] amen he's not just this isn't just a man
[25:43] being picky amen and trying
[25:44] he understands the whole picture like
[25:47] paul understands the whole picture
[25:49] amen the woman has to have a sign of
[25:51] authority upon her head
[25:52] amen because that's how god fashioned it
[25:55] amen god wasn't having afterthoughts
[25:57] god wasn't trying to clean up his mess
[26:00] god made her a certain way with the
[26:01] weakness to open the door but he had a
[26:03] plan for her to have a covering
[26:06] and then his plan would be that she
[26:08] would be under authority she'd be under
[26:10] headship for her protection
[26:12] amen so god could keep her protected but
[26:14] still use her in the plan of redemption
[26:18] so the hair the hair is is
[26:21] more than just it's not just a doctrine
[26:23] to make you write it's not just saying
[26:25] well we get all this right we get it
[26:26] right
[26:27] it paints the same picture it goes all
[26:29] the way back to genesis 3 16.
[26:32] it's not just new let's go to first
[26:35] peter chapter 3.
[26:42] first peter chapter 3
[26:50] and we'll start at verse one first peter
[26:52] chapter three verse one
[26:53] likewise you wives be in subjection to
[26:55] your own husbands
[26:57] that if any obey not the word they also
[26:59] may without the word be won
[27:01] by the conversation of the wives while
[27:04] they behold your chaste conversation
[27:06] coupled with fear
[27:07] whose adorning let it not be that
[27:09] outward adorning of the plotting of the
[27:11] hair of the wearing of gold or of
[27:12] putting on of apparel
[27:14] but let it be the hidden man of the
[27:15] heart and that which is not corruptable
[27:18] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[27:20] spirit which is in the sight of god of
[27:22] great price
[27:23] for after this manner in the old time
[27:25] the holy women also who trusted it god
[27:28] adored themselves being in subjection to
[27:30] their own husbands
[27:31] now when paul or peter here when peter's
[27:34] talking
[27:35] when he look we let's go back to verse 4
[27:37] he says even the ornament of a meek and
[27:40] quiet spirit
[27:41] which is in the sight of god a great
[27:43] price
[27:45] peter's not giving you his preference on
[27:47] the way a woman should conduct herself
[27:50] he's he's going back and showing you
[27:53] this is what god wants this is what
[27:55] god's desire
[27:56] and this is in the in the eyes of god of
[27:59] great value
[28:00] amen it's not that that peter says you
[28:02] know you need to be meek and quiet
[28:04] but god wants the woman to be meek and
[28:06] quiet he doesn't want her to be like the
[28:08] man
[28:10] he wants her to be subject subject to
[28:12] the man which is the sight of god a
[28:14] great price
[28:15] for after this manner in the old time
[28:17] the holy women also who trusted in god
[28:19] adorned themselves
[28:20] being in subjection and to their own
[28:22] husbands even as sarah obeyed abraham
[28:24] calling him lord
[28:25] whose daughters you are as long as you
[28:27] do well and not afraid with
[28:30] any amazement likewise you husbands
[28:32] dwell with them according to knowledge
[28:34] giving honor to the wife is unto the
[28:36] weaker vessel
[28:37] and as being heirs together of the grace
[28:39] of life that your prayers
[28:42] be not hindered we took this verse and
[28:45] started with it i believe
[28:46] on sunday but talked about where he says
[28:51] likewise your husbands dwell with them
[28:52] according to knowledge
[28:54] dwell with them according to knowledge
[28:55] because now you know
[28:57] why she's made the way she's made now
[28:59] you know what's different
[29:01] and why it's different amen now dwell
[29:03] with her according to knowledge
[29:04] giving honor our great value unto the
[29:07] weaker vessel
[29:10] giving honor to thy wife is unto the
[29:11] weaker vessel as being
[29:13] heirs together of the grace of life that
[29:15] your prayers
[29:16] be not hindered so now
[29:19] peter says have understanding have
[29:22] knowledge
[29:23] understand dwell with your wife
[29:24] according to knowledge understand the
[29:26] way she's made women understand the way
[29:28] you're made
[29:29] come together the way god brought this
[29:31] picture together
[29:32] and everything will be all right but
[29:33] when we start to mix up this picture by
[29:35] our own reasoning we start to ruin the
[29:38] picture that god has laid down
[29:39] and it won't come out right and and the
[29:42] reason that this matters so much
[29:44] is because brother ben will take the
[29:45] lady's same foundational truth down and
[29:48] he'll tie it right back to christ in the
[29:50] church
[29:50] amen just like the apostle paul did and
[29:52] the question that i like to pose
[29:54] is if we're not able to manifest the
[29:57] word in the natural
[29:58] are we manifesting it in the spiritual
[30:02] because we say you know i'm subject to
[30:04] christ i'm obedient to my headship which
[30:06] is the word
[30:06] i'm doing all this but if we're not able
[30:09] to actually display this and manifest in
[30:11] the flesh
[30:11] are we actually doing it like we think
[30:13] we are in the spiritual
[30:15] because one is a type of the other and
[30:17] one is a reflection of the other
[30:19] and if we can't get this harmony in our
[30:21] homes and we can't get a man who will
[30:24] love his wife
[30:24] and treat her as christ treated the
[30:26] church and we can't get a man to take
[30:28] responsibility for his wife and a woman
[30:30] to have a meek and quiet spirit and
[30:31] subject herself to her husband
[30:33] even as sarah did to abraham calling him
[30:36] lord
[30:36] if we can't get there because the
[30:38] laodicean ideas and conflict in the home
[30:41] the question is are we doing it as the
[30:43] bride of jesus christ
[30:47] that's why these things matter we can't
[30:49] have one completely in disorder and say
[30:51] well the other one's fine i'm fine with
[30:52] christ i'm the bride of christ
[30:54] why is this in such disharmony and
[30:56] disorder if everything's fine over here
[30:59] if everything's fine over here it should
[31:02] be displaying itself in the family
[31:05] it should be uh there should be a man
[31:07] who's caring for his wife
[31:09] who's loving her and protecting her and
[31:11] overshadowing her there should be a wife
[31:13] that's submitting herself to her husband
[31:15] under his care and under his love with a
[31:17] meek and quiet spirit
[31:18] it should be a natural outcropping of
[31:20] the revelation that we have in this hour
[31:25] that's what brother ben said you find
[31:27] these pentecostal women they have long
[31:28] hair and enough
[31:29] temper to fight a buzz all he said
[31:31] that's not it
[31:33] there's still something wrong amen it
[31:35] looks like we got something
[31:37] amen but it's not manifesting the life
[31:39] that the word called for
[31:41] it's not it's not displaying the picture
[31:43] it's not a mini drama showing the great
[31:45] drama
[31:46] some things got twisted up somewhere
[31:50] so the truth of the word brings the
[31:52] revelation to bring understanding
[31:55] let's go to first corinthians chapter
[31:58] one
[32:08] first corinthians chapter 1
[32:12] verse 25.
[32:17] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[32:19] than men
[32:20] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[32:22] men for you see your calling brother and
[32:24] how that not many wise men after the
[32:26] flesh not many mighty not many noble or
[32:28] called
[32:29] but god hath chosen the foolish things
[32:32] of the world to confound the wise
[32:34] and god has chosen the weak things of
[32:36] the world to confound the things which
[32:37] are mighty
[32:38] and base things of the world and things
[32:40] which are despised ye god has chosen
[32:43] god god chosen yea and things which are
[32:46] not to bring to not
[32:48] things that are that no flesh should
[32:50] glory in his presence
[32:51] so god he created amen he created the
[32:55] woman a weaker vessel
[32:56] so that he could use it for redemption
[32:58] but he's going to take the weak
[33:00] things because he's going to use a bride
[33:02] in the end time
[33:04] seemingly weak and he's going to take
[33:05] the weak things to confound those things
[33:07] that are strong to overthrow those
[33:09] things that are strong
[33:12] because we said last time the devil
[33:13] doesn't understand weakness
[33:15] he doesn't understand humility he
[33:17] doesn't understand surrender
[33:19] those are attributes that he doesn't
[33:20] understand
[33:22] and so god was always coming low amen
[33:26] in a low way god is always taking down
[33:28] and tearing down the mighty
[33:30] strong things of the enemy remember when
[33:33] moses was going to deliver the children
[33:35] of israel he he had heard
[33:37] words that his mom told him he had an
[33:39] intellectual
[33:40] understanding of being a deliverer and
[33:42] what it meant to be a deliverer
[33:45] but god had not yet caught into that yet
[33:47] so he went out
[33:48] of his own free will he was going to
[33:51] perform the word amen because his mom
[33:53] had told him the prophecy
[33:54] his mother had nursed him and told him
[33:56] who he was he was born a proper child
[33:58] and the prophecy of 400 years and
[34:00] deliverance and all of these things
[34:02] he had been taught so under an education
[34:04] under a christian education
[34:06] he went forth to master the word he went
[34:09] forth to perform the word
[34:11] and he slew in his strength one egyptian
[34:13] amen and then he was rejected by his
[34:15] brother and he ran off to the wilderness
[34:17] because it wasn't yet god's time it
[34:19] wasn't yet god's way
[34:21] although he was god's choice it wasn't
[34:24] the right time
[34:25] so god allowed him in defeat to run to
[34:27] the wilderness
[34:28] and he allowed him to get weaker over
[34:29] the course of 40 years
[34:33] and until he got so weak when god
[34:35] finally came in a very supernatural
[34:37] display
[34:37] by coming in a burning bush and speaking
[34:39] to him he had become so
[34:41] weak he wouldn't even go back he began
[34:43] to argue with god
[34:44] i can't do it i can't speak i can't go
[34:47] back they won't listen to me
[34:48] he had a million excuses for why he
[34:50] couldn't do it and he had finally
[34:52] gotten to the condition that god wanted
[34:54] amen
[34:58] you see
[35:01] god didn't want him in his strength to
[35:04] fulfill the word
[35:05] god wanted the fill that fulfills word
[35:07] through moses he didn't want moses to do
[35:09] it god wanted to do it
[35:12] and so god chose a weaker vessel so that
[35:16] he could get glory for it
[35:23] let's turn to the book of esther i want
[35:26] to contrast two queens just to paint the
[35:28] picture
[35:29] of what i'm trying to say and we know
[35:31] these things really well but i'd like to
[35:32] go through these scriptures
[35:33] let's go to the book of esther and look
[35:36] at chapter 2.
[35:39] i want to look at the character of
[35:42] esther
[35:44] but we want to see the condition
[35:48] that esther is going to be in
[35:51] esther is coming from she's an orphan
[35:54] girl
[35:55] being raised by a cousin she
[35:59] she is going to be picked and selected
[36:01] to go into the house of virgins to be
[36:03] in this contest of sorts to see who
[36:06] would be the next queen
[36:08] and she's going through the process of
[36:10] purification and going through all of
[36:12] these things
[36:13] but if we follow esther's character
[36:16] and the way god uses esther we're going
[36:19] to be able to understand something about
[36:21] the bride and what god is looking for
[36:24] in esther chapter 2 verse 15. i'm just
[36:26] going to read just a couple little
[36:28] verses out of this
[36:30] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[36:31] of abigail the uncle of mordecai
[36:34] who had taken her first daughter had
[36:36] come to go in unto the king she required
[36:38] nothing
[36:39] but what haggai the king's chamberlain
[36:41] the keeper the woman appointed
[36:43] and esther obtained favor in the sight
[36:45] of all them that looked on her
[36:48] let's go down to verse 20. esther had
[36:51] not yet
[36:52] showed her kindred nor her people as
[36:54] mordecai had charged her
[36:55] for esther did the commandment of
[36:57] mordecai like
[36:59] as when she was brought up with him
[37:02] i want to i want to look at this
[37:04] character for a minute and type it with
[37:06] the character of the bride because
[37:08] esther would not use her own thinking
[37:11] esther would not use her own mind
[37:13] and esther was not using her own will
[37:16] but
[37:16] esther here is submitting to haggai
[37:19] and she's submitting the mordecai so you
[37:22] see
[37:23] that she can she can humble herself and
[37:26] submit under the headship that god has
[37:28] placed over her
[37:29] because under this headship she's under
[37:31] mordecai's headship and then when she
[37:33] moves to the house of the women
[37:34] she is under haggai's headship but under
[37:37] that headship
[37:38] she settles down and submits to that
[37:40] headship
[37:41] and her submission to the headship god
[37:44] placed over
[37:45] is going to exalt her to the position of
[37:47] queen
[37:48] not because she was smarter not because
[37:51] she was more beautiful
[37:52] not because she was able to figure
[37:54] anything out amen it wasn't
[37:56] her strength it was her submission that
[37:59] brought her
[38:00] from hadassah to esther from myrtle to
[38:03] star
[38:04] and it's not going to be the bride's
[38:06] strength it's not going to be her power
[38:08] her intelligence her ability to figure
[38:10] anything out that is going to have her
[38:12] exalted in this end time and have a
[38:14] great victory rot through her
[38:15] it is going to be her submission to the
[38:17] word it's going to be her surrender her
[38:19] submission
[38:20] her throwing down her own ideas and her
[38:22] own desires
[38:23] and just taking the headship that god
[38:25] gave her in this age and submitting
[38:27] under that headship
[38:28] and that headshit that submission to
[38:30] headship is going to bring a tremendous
[38:32] victory this is why the church ages
[38:35] failed because they couldn't stay
[38:37] submissive they couldn't stay the weaker
[38:39] vessel under the submission the headship
[38:42] that god gave him
[38:42] they had to start taking their own
[38:44] thinking had to become strong
[38:47] and every time the church became strong
[38:49] they fell
[38:50] and then god would get another weak one
[38:52] and start over and the next time they
[38:54] became strong they fell
[38:55] become strong they fell become strong
[38:57] they fell because god was looking for
[38:58] one that would just stay submissive
[39:02] let's come to the chapter 7 here in
[39:04] esther
[39:07] now haman we we know this story super
[39:10] well but haman is going to
[39:12] bring a destruction of the jews and and
[39:14] esther's a jew and mordecai's a jew and
[39:17] and there's a great destruction coming
[39:19] and haman's a powerful man
[39:20] and there's no way there's no
[39:23] possibility
[39:24] for esther or mordecai or anybody by
[39:26] force
[39:27] to be able to exert their own strength
[39:30] amen to be able to stop haman
[39:32] there's only one way amen that mordecai
[39:35] can see
[39:36] to stop the plan of haman and that one
[39:39] way
[39:39] lies in the submissive humble little
[39:42] esther
[39:44] she's the key for salvation she's the
[39:47] key
[39:47] for redemption in this story and it lies
[39:50] in esther
[39:51] but esther though she has the key she
[39:54] becomes the pivotal
[39:55] figure amen in the salvation of the jews
[39:58] amen though she becomes that pivotal
[40:00] figure she's the one that god's going to
[40:02] use
[40:03] it is all resting upon her she doesn't
[40:05] take that like moses did in the
[40:07] beginning
[40:07] and hear all the stories and believe
[40:09] them all and go out on their own
[40:10] strength to do something wonderful
[40:12] how is she going to bring about
[40:15] salvation
[40:16] how is she going to bring about a great
[40:18] deliverance she is going to humble
[40:20] herself
[40:22] mordecai comes and gives her
[40:23] instructions and she
[40:25] hearkens to the voice of mordecai she
[40:27] humbles herself
[40:28] she fasts she prays she puts on the
[40:31] royal apparel
[40:32] she comes into the king she asks the
[40:34] king she doesn't stomp in and make
[40:35] demands
[40:36] she comes in humbly and she comes in
[40:38] respectfully and she asks the king to a
[40:40] banquet of wine
[40:42] and he comes to the banquet with haman
[40:44] and then they feast that day and he asks
[40:46] her what is it that you want
[40:47] and she says come tomorrow and i'll do
[40:50] likewise and i'll tell you tomorrow
[40:51] so we pick up the story on the second
[40:53] trip the second day
[40:57] verse 7 or chapter 7 verse 1 so the king
[41:00] and haman came to the banquet with
[41:02] esther the queen
[41:03] and the king said again into esther on
[41:05] the second day
[41:06] at the banquet of wine what is thy
[41:08] petition queen esther
[41:10] and it shall be granted thee and what is
[41:12] thy request and it shall be performed
[41:14] even to half the kingdom then esther the
[41:18] queen answered and said
[41:19] if i have found favor in my sight
[41:23] o king and if it pleased the king
[41:26] she goes right back to humility
[41:29] surrender
[41:30] and submission if it please the king let
[41:34] my life be given me at the petition in
[41:36] my people at my request
[41:39] for we are sold i and my people to be
[41:41] destroyed and to be slain
[41:43] and to perish but if we had been sold
[41:46] for bond men and bond women i had held
[41:48] my tongue although the enemy could not
[41:50] countervail
[41:51] the king's damage then the king azaris
[41:54] answered and said unto esther the queen
[41:56] who is he and where is he that durst
[41:59] presume in his heart to do so and esther
[42:02] said the adversary the enemy
[42:04] is this wicked haman then haman was
[42:07] afraid
[42:08] before the king and the queen
[42:12] what might did esther use what power did
[42:15] she have
[42:16] how did she bring this great victory for
[42:18] the jews
[42:20] she just went humbly and reverently to
[42:21] the king
[42:23] and when she showed honor and respect to
[42:25] the king
[42:26] and she entertained the king and invited
[42:28] the king to her banquet
[42:30] amen then the king asked her what is it
[42:32] you want
[42:33] esther and esther said all i want is my
[42:35] life.
[42:36] and he said who and she said haman and
[42:39] then from then on the king
[42:40] takes care of the rest and brings the
[42:42] destruction you see esther never had to
[42:44] be powerful
[42:45] esther never had to be mighty esther
[42:47] didn't have to figure anything out
[42:49] all she had to do was respect and honor
[42:51] that king
[42:52] and show reverence to the king and
[42:54] entertain the king
[42:55] and serve the king and through her
[42:57] humility and her servants and her
[42:59] reverence the king would adore her
[43:01] and say what can i do for you and she
[43:03] would say just let me live i want
[43:04] eternal life
[43:09] and they'll say to her who is this
[43:12] that's taking your life
[43:13] she said it's this wicked haman that i'm
[43:15] stuck in
[43:18] you see we can get the wrong
[43:22] idea sometimes
[43:25] about what our role is because
[43:28] god is going to use the woman and he
[43:31] does all down through the bible he uses
[43:33] the woman for redemption he uses the
[43:35] woman
[43:36] for for uh for redemption for
[43:38] deliverance
[43:39] all through the bible but if you look
[43:43] it's through submission subjection to
[43:46] humility
[43:47] and in the end time god's going to do
[43:49] the same thing but what kind of wife is
[43:51] it going to take
[43:51] what kind of queen does he want does he
[43:54] want one that's going to stomp around
[43:55] and
[43:55] make bold claims say god you have to do
[43:57] this and god you're going to do that
[43:59] or does he want one that says oh god i
[44:01] love you i just want to serve you
[44:04] i just want to keep your word
[44:07] let's turn to first kings and now let's
[44:09] look at jezebel
[44:11] she's the other queen we want to look at
[44:19] first kings 21.
[44:23] and verse 3.
[44:30] yeah first kings chapter 21 verse 3
[44:34] and nabath said to ahab the lord forbid
[44:37] at me that i should give the inheritance
[44:39] of my fathers unto thee
[44:40] and they have came into his house heavy
[44:42] and displeased because of the word which
[44:44] nabot the jezreelite
[44:45] had spoken him for he had said i will
[44:48] not give thee the inheritance of my
[44:49] fathers
[44:50] and he laid him down upon his bed and
[44:52] turned away his face and would eat no
[44:54] bread
[44:55] but jezebel's wife came to him and said
[44:57] unto him why is thy spirit so sad
[45:00] that thou eat is no bread and he said
[45:02] unto her because i spake in the naboth
[45:04] the jezreelite
[45:05] and said unto him give me thy vineyard
[45:07] for money or else if it pleased thee
[45:09] i will give thee another vineyard for it
[45:11] and he answered
[45:12] i will not give thee my vineyard and
[45:15] jezebel's wife said unto him
[45:17] does thou now govern the kingdom of
[45:19] israel arise and eat bread
[45:21] and let thine heart be merry i will give
[45:24] thee the vineyard of naboth
[45:26] the jezreelite see this is a different
[45:29] queen
[45:29] this is a wicked queen this is a heathen
[45:32] queen
[45:32] where esther is a different nature all
[45:34] together one
[45:36] thinks she can do something about it the
[45:38] other one realized there was nothing she
[45:40] could do
[45:40] she was going to need the king and if
[45:43] she was going to need the king she was
[45:44] going to have to honor and reverence
[45:46] subject herself and entertain the king
[45:49] here's
[45:49] here is jezebel who has no confidence in
[45:52] the king
[45:53] she's putting the king down amen and
[45:55] putting the king under her
[45:56] and said you're not capable but leave it
[45:58] to me i'll deliver it for you
[46:01] this is the same kind of attitude we see
[46:03] in revelation chapter 18
[46:06] with the great which is called
[46:09] jezebel
[46:10] let's go down to verse 15. we know she
[46:12] works her plan
[46:14] in down to 15 she says and it came to
[46:17] pass when jezebel heard that naboth was
[46:19] stoned and he was dead that jezebel said
[46:22] to ahab
[46:22] arise take possession of the vineyard of
[46:26] naboth the jezreelite
[46:28] which he refused to give thee for money
[46:29] for nabath is not alive but dead
[46:32] and it came to pass when ahab heard that
[46:34] naboth was dead
[46:35] that ahab rose up to go down to the
[46:37] vineyard of nabat the jezreelite
[46:39] to take possession of it we've got two
[46:42] big problems here
[46:43] we got a woman who's out of her place
[46:45] and we have a man who's out of his place
[46:48] brother brahm says in the message be
[46:50] certain of god he said god loves his
[46:52] church but when
[46:53] we get out of the will of god the enemy
[46:55] takes the church over
[46:56] and ahab who was king of israel at that
[46:58] time and to my thinking the most wicked
[47:01] king israel ever had
[47:02] because he married an idolater jezebel
[47:04] she was a sinner and an ungodly person
[47:06] and instead of being a man of his own
[47:08] house
[47:09] he gave in to her and through that and
[47:12] and
[47:12] through that they had caused the nation
[47:14] to come to moral decay
[47:17] brother abraham says again in the thythe
[47:19] and church age
[47:20] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[47:22] disposition
[47:24] she is according to the holy scripture
[47:26] to be submissive to the male
[47:28] that is commanded of her woman who is
[47:30] truly female
[47:32] all female will be of that disposition
[47:35] not a doormat no real man makes a female
[47:38] a doormat
[47:39] but she will want to be under authority
[47:42] and not rule over the mail
[47:44] for he is the head of the house if she
[47:46] breaks that image that god made for her
[47:48] she is perverted
[47:50] any male that lets the woman take
[47:51] authority has also broken that image
[47:54] and is perverted that is why a woman
[47:57] cannot wear that which pertains to a man
[47:59] or cut her hair
[48:00] she is never to wear garments that
[48:01] pertain to a man or mail or cut her hair
[48:04] when she does
[48:05] she is intruding into the male domain
[48:07] taking authority and perverting herself
[48:10] and when a woman evades the pulpit which
[48:12] is commanded she must not do
[48:13] she shows what spirit she is of being a
[48:16] dominant female is
[48:17] antichrist and seeds of the roman
[48:19] catholic church are in her
[48:20] though she may deny this ever so
[48:22] vehemently but when it comes to the word
[48:25] let god be true in every man's word a
[48:28] lie
[48:29] let's go to first timothy chapter 2.
[48:51] first timothy chapter 2
[48:56] verse 11
[48:59] let the woman learn in silence with all
[49:01] subjection
[49:03] but i suffered not a woman to teach in
[49:04] order to serve authority over the man
[49:06] but to be in silence for adam was first
[49:09] form
[49:09] then eve and adam was not deceived but
[49:12] the woman being deceived
[49:13] was in the transgression so when the
[49:16] when the apostle paul speaking here in
[49:18] timothy when he when he lays down the
[49:20] order of authority
[49:21] and he tells a woman that he doesn't
[49:23] allow a woman to teach her to serve
[49:25] authority
[49:25] but to be but to be in silence
[49:29] he goes right back to genesis
[49:33] paul is not paul is not just he's not
[49:36] just after women he's not just coming up
[49:38] with his own thing where did paul get
[49:39] this he got it out of genesis
[49:41] he goes right back to the fall there's
[49:43] something he understands about the fall
[49:45] and something he understands about the
[49:47] woman and he understands what god did in
[49:49] genesis 3 16
[49:50] and he's bringing all that into the
[49:52] church and he's placing it in a church
[49:54] according to what he saw back in genesis
[49:57] for adam was first formed then eve
[49:59] and adam was not deceived but the woman
[50:01] being deceived was in the transgression
[50:03] that's why she's been placed under
[50:05] headship that's why the man takes
[50:07] authority over her
[50:08] that's why she's silent in the church
[50:10] that's why she's subject
[50:13] because god is typing it with his church
[50:15] with his bride
[50:18] brother he refers to this scripture and
[50:21] why we're not a denomination he says i
[50:23] want to read
[50:24] how many believes that paul was an
[50:25] inspired teacher now remember paul wrote
[50:27] this to timothy
[50:28] first corinthians 14 32 and he reads the
[50:30] scripture
[50:31] first he reads the first line let your
[50:33] women keep silence in church he said did
[50:34] you hear what he said
[50:36] let your women keep silencing churches
[50:38] first not permitting them to speak
[50:40] but they are commanded to be under
[50:41] obedience have you got a marginal
[50:43] reading on that if you are
[50:44] run it back and see if it don't take
[50:46] genesis 3 16
[50:47] when god told eve because that she had
[50:49] listened to the serpent instead of her
[50:50] husband
[50:51] he'd rule over her all the days of her
[50:53] life how can the woman come and rule
[50:55] over a man
[50:56] be pastor and deacon when the bible said
[50:58] let her be obedient
[51:00] just like it was in the beginning god
[51:02] can't change
[51:03] you can't make the word say one thing
[51:05] here and another thing over here
[51:07] it don't do it it's the same thing all
[51:09] the time
[51:10] this is one major theme in the bible
[51:12] it's not
[51:13] disjointed he's not saying one thing in
[51:15] the old testament something new in the
[51:17] in the new testament it's one theme it's
[51:20] one picture it's
[51:21] painting one story amen and we got to
[51:23] see the continuity of the scripture all
[51:25] the way through
[51:26] and because we've lost the picture of
[51:28] the word amen now
[51:30] we live in a society like we live in
[51:32] that is so perverted
[51:33] they've got so far away from the word
[51:36] how did we get to the place
[51:37] where churches are accepting
[51:39] homosexuality and the debating over
[51:41] homosexual marriage
[51:42] and over ministers and and women
[51:44] ministers and homosexual ministers
[51:46] where how did we get so far because they
[51:48] left the simple things
[51:51] because we lost the picture of the bible
[51:53] we lost a picture of the bible we took
[51:55] it to reasoning
[51:56] and they started saying things like you
[51:57] know the apostle paul he was just after
[52:00] the women he had something against the
[52:01] women he was extra hard on women the
[52:03] apostle paul had nothing against women
[52:05] he wasn't extra hard on women
[52:07] the apostle paul had the revelation of
[52:08] the word he knew
[52:10] what happened in the garden of eden he
[52:12] knew what happened in genesis and why
[52:14] god said what he said
[52:17] what was paul doing paul was confirming
[52:19] what the word had already said
[52:21] paul was bringing into the church what
[52:22] god had already established he saw the
[52:24] pattern
[52:25] and he lifted the pattern and he put it
[52:26] here and that's what's happening in our
[52:29] marriages and in our homes and in our
[52:30] churches
[52:31] we're seeing the pattern and we're just
[52:33] lifting the pattern
[52:34] amen by the word of god and putting the
[52:36] pattern on us
[52:37] on our families on our children in the
[52:40] church what is it it's the same picture
[52:42] it's the same picture in your life
[52:44] it's the same picture in your home it's
[52:45] the same picture in the church
[52:48] it should all be speaking the same thing
[52:50] and my human reasoning they begin to
[52:52] reason
[52:53] boy why did paul say that and does it
[52:55] really mean that
[52:56] and does it apply to the day and then i
[52:58] was i was driving down the road one day
[53:00] with a an account rep that was an
[53:02] account rep for a product we sold
[53:04] and we're driving down the road and i
[53:06] found out that this man
[53:07] was ordained a nazarene preacher
[53:11] he was an associate pastor of a as a
[53:13] nazarene church he had credentials went
[53:15] to school had the papers had all of that
[53:18] and he started telling us we started
[53:20] talking about something i don't remember
[53:22] what it was
[53:23] he started telling us that they had just
[53:26] elected
[53:26] a new president or whatever the head of
[53:29] the nazarene church was
[53:30] and it was a woman and i asked him the
[53:33] question i said do you think that's a
[53:34] good thing
[53:35] he said oh yeah and he started telling
[53:38] me why it was a good thing
[53:39] because she understands families better
[53:41] because we've had a one-sided view the
[53:44] men's side for so long and now
[53:45] we can get the opinion of a woman and
[53:47] bring the nazarene church into a greater
[53:49] balance
[53:49] and better serve women and better serve
[53:51] families
[53:54] i thought how do you get to this place
[53:58] because we take reasoning and the woman
[54:01] started thinking she knew as much as the
[54:03] man the word
[54:06] instead of just staying in subjection
[54:08] she began to use her reasoning
[54:10] i'm talking about the woman of the
[54:12] church
[54:14] she began to think that she was just as
[54:17] good as the word
[54:19] that she was equal to the word and her
[54:22] or her ideas were just as good as the
[54:24] word that she could understand the word
[54:27] instead of just submitting to it
[54:28] she could reason with it
[54:31] and we get so far out of the line
[54:36] and i began to talk to this man about
[54:38] the scripture and i started just going
[54:40] back through the scriptures
[54:42] and as we went to the scriptures the man
[54:44] said he says now you have to understand
[54:46] why paul said that
[54:48] i said praise god let's understand why
[54:50] paul said that
[54:52] he said if you go back and read the
[54:54] history and all the documents in that
[54:56] time
[54:57] you'll find out that the women were
[54:58] unruly so he told them to keep science
[55:00] because they were standing up and
[55:01] yelling across
[55:02] to one another and they were very unruly
[55:09] i'm telling you so wise we become
[55:13] fools and i asked him
[55:18] i said i said why would god
[55:21] give us a bible that we couldn't trust
[55:26] he said what i said why would god give
[55:28] us a bible
[55:30] and then we would have to go find
[55:32] historical documents
[55:35] because the bible doesn't paint the
[55:36] right picture but if we go get the
[55:38] historical documents
[55:39] then we'll understand what paul's saying
[55:40] so we can reject what's written in the
[55:42] word
[55:43] i said that doesn't make any sense to me
[55:45] i said if we just stick with the word
[55:47] it paints the right picture and that's
[55:50] what's happened all around us friend
[55:52] and unfortunately that thing tries to
[55:53] creep in little by little
[55:55] but i say don't even let it creep in a
[55:57] little amen let's stick with the picture
[55:59] god gave us because the picture's
[56:00] perfect
[56:01] it's for a reason god did it for a
[56:03] reason friends
[56:06] and if we can keep the image right we'll
[56:08] benefit from that
[56:12] brother says in questions and answers on
[56:14] hebrews
[56:15] listen here the man is the ruler don't
[56:17] you think you can rule the house
[56:19] you're not the ruler of the house you're
[56:20] absolute you're not a slave now
[56:22] but you're a help mate and the man has
[56:25] the rule over his wife and he's
[56:26] responsible solely for his wife
[56:29] god makes the man answer for his wife
[56:32] one thing that you'll find it like i
[56:34] said before there's an equity with god
[56:36] god will put woman the woman underneath
[56:38] the headship of the man
[56:40] but with with with that comes a great
[56:43] tremendous responsibility
[56:45] now the man is going to give an answer
[56:47] to god for the conduct of his wife
[56:49] but the wife is not going to answer for
[56:50] the conduct of her husband
[56:52] so when god takes this and he and he
[56:54] puts the he puts the headship over the
[56:56] woman and the woman under the headship
[56:58] of the man
[56:58] now the responsibility lies on the man
[57:02] to guide and to shepherd to nurture and
[57:04] to care for his wife
[57:05] and lead her in the way it is right
[57:07] because he's going to answer for her
[57:09] conduct
[57:10] but she's not going to answer for his
[57:14] and i say god put me under the headship
[57:16] of christ
[57:18] let him answer for me let him answer for
[57:22] me if i can just stay subject to him
[57:28] brother bem says in sirs we would see
[57:30] jesus i don't care if you don't even
[57:31] know your abcs
[57:33] just the only thing you have to do
[57:37] the only thing you have to have is a
[57:38] humble submitted heart to god
[57:41] and god will work his will through you
[57:45] let's turn to the book of ruth
[57:51] back here before samuel
[58:01] after judges the book of ruth chapter 3.
[58:08] verse 6.
[58:16] and she went down into the floor and did
[58:18] according to all that her mother-in-law
[58:20] bathed her here comes young ruth she's a
[58:23] widow now and
[58:24] naomi's her mother-in-law and they come
[58:26] into the land and she's gleaning and we
[58:28] we know the story there there's all this
[58:30] that's happening between boaz and his
[58:31] servants and her and
[58:33] and now naomi tells her a plan you go
[58:36] down to the threshing floor
[58:37] amen and tell her give her specific
[58:40] instructions how to dress and what to do
[58:42] and to prepare herself and what to go
[58:44] and now ruth doesn't take her own mind
[58:46] amen but ruth now is going to be a key
[58:49] for redemption amen
[58:51] there's a key in ruth ruth holds the key
[58:53] to redemption
[58:54] naomi's land is not redeemed amen
[58:57] they're in a poverty stricken situation
[58:59] all the men are gone at this point and
[59:01] there is a key laying in ruth and ruth
[59:04] holds the key to redemption
[59:05] but ruth is not going to go by her force
[59:08] and by power and by wisdom and by
[59:10] strength
[59:10] she's just going to submit herself to
[59:12] the leadership of naomi
[59:14] naomi's going to tell her what to do
[59:18] and she's just going to follow what
[59:20] naomi tells her because
[59:22] naomi is her mother-in-law
[59:26] let me read this again chapter 3 verse 6
[59:29] and when she went down into the floor
[59:30] and did according to all that her
[59:31] mother-in-law bade her
[59:33] and when boaz had eaten and drunk and
[59:35] his heart was merry
[59:36] he went to lie down at the end of the
[59:38] heap of corn and she came softly and
[59:40] then covered his feet
[59:41] and later down and it came to pass at
[59:44] midnight that the man was afraid and
[59:45] turned
[59:46] himself and behold a woman lay at his
[59:48] feet
[59:49] and he said who art thou and she
[59:51] answered i am ruth thine handmaid
[59:53] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[59:55] handmaid for thou art and near kinsmen
[59:58] and she's saying i need you to cover me
[1:00:02] it was symbolic of him becoming her head
[1:00:04] of him covering her spreading his skirt
[1:00:06] to include her
[1:00:08] and he said blessed be thou of the lord
[1:00:10] my daughter
[1:00:11] for thou has showed more kindness in the
[1:00:13] latter end than at the beginning and so
[1:00:14] much as thou
[1:00:15] followest not young men whether poor
[1:00:18] or rich and now my daughter fear not i
[1:00:21] will do
[1:00:22] to thee all that thou requires for all
[1:00:24] the city and my people doth know
[1:00:26] that thou art a virtuous woman
[1:00:30] virtue means strength ruth was a
[1:00:33] virtuous woman she had strength strength
[1:00:35] of character
[1:00:36] but her strength was not what produced
[1:00:38] her redemption
[1:00:39] she had the strength to submit herself
[1:00:42] she had the strength to just surrender
[1:00:45] amen and lay down at this man's feet
[1:00:47] because naomi
[1:00:48] amen needed redemption they all needed
[1:00:50] redemption and the only path
[1:00:52] was for ruth to submit herself and lay
[1:00:54] herself at the feet of this man
[1:00:56] and when he woke up and he says who are
[1:00:59] you said i'm ruth cover me with your
[1:01:00] skirt will you cover me and become our
[1:01:02] head
[1:01:03] and bring redemption to us and he says
[1:01:05] thou art a virtuous woman
[1:01:09] she didn't do it through strength what
[1:01:11] was her virtue
[1:01:12] submission what is our virtue
[1:01:16] submission now listen i want to read a
[1:01:19] few quotes to bring this home
[1:01:21] to where we're at now now we find out
[1:01:24] that god gave his children the best
[1:01:26] they really don't have to improve it he
[1:01:28] never changes
[1:01:30] he hasn't changed one bit since the
[1:01:31] first time he gave for his children's
[1:01:33] protection
[1:01:35] now there was war in heaven he had to
[1:01:38] kick out satan
[1:01:39] then he come down on the earth and
[1:01:41] fortified his children with his word
[1:01:44] i want to ask you something just think
[1:01:47] now
[1:01:47] eve did not while she's standing in this
[1:01:49] great fortress of his word
[1:01:51] now satan was on the outside trying to
[1:01:53] use some kind of technique to get to her
[1:01:55] get her out of there for as long as she
[1:01:58] stayed behind the word
[1:02:00] everything was fine that's where we make
[1:02:02] our mistake we make our mistake when we
[1:02:04] get from behind the word
[1:02:05] so i believe all bible believers think
[1:02:07] it that way
[1:02:08] we get from behind the word then we're
[1:02:11] in trouble but as long as we keep the
[1:02:13] word ahead of us
[1:02:14] don't get ahead of the word let the word
[1:02:16] get ahead of you
[1:02:18] you just let it go first you just live
[1:02:21] right behind it
[1:02:22] it plows the ditch and you just walk in
[1:02:24] it
[1:02:25] let the word go before you don't get
[1:02:28] ahead of the word
[1:02:29] never try to lead the word let the word
[1:02:31] lead you
[1:02:34] you say we don't do that oh they do it
[1:02:36] worldwide it happens all over the place
[1:02:38] we try to get the word to say something
[1:02:40] we want it to say amen
[1:02:42] we try to make an excuse for an activity
[1:02:45] something we want to do or something we
[1:02:47] want to get away with or some
[1:02:48] of our own understanding and we tried to
[1:02:51] lead the word
[1:02:52] into our own will
[1:02:55] but he says don't lead the word you let
[1:02:57] the word lead you
[1:03:00] you just let it go first you just live
[1:03:02] right behind it
[1:03:03] it plows the ditch and you just walk in
[1:03:05] it you walk behind the word don't ever
[1:03:07] get ahead of the word
[1:03:09] the conflict between god and satan satan
[1:03:11] and eden when he first come to these
[1:03:13] attack
[1:03:14] attack a person knowing the children of
[1:03:16] god was fortified with his word
[1:03:18] satan attacked the word he never
[1:03:20] attacked the being
[1:03:22] the woman he attacked the word first
[1:03:25] see she was fortified behind the word
[1:03:28] she was protected by the word so satan
[1:03:30] could not come to her
[1:03:32] first he first had to attack the word
[1:03:35] and the devil doesn't come to you and i
[1:03:38] first
[1:03:38] he first comes to the word when he gets
[1:03:41] us to move away from the word then he
[1:03:43] can come to us
[1:03:45] we still have the same protection in
[1:03:47] this day if we just stay under the word
[1:03:51] and the message the feast of trumpets he
[1:03:53] says go into the prophet's chamber and
[1:03:55] watch them seven steps
[1:03:57] where did the guard meet the challenge
[1:03:59] to bring the camera into the presence of
[1:04:00] the king
[1:04:02] at the top of the steps was in the
[1:04:04] seventh step
[1:04:05] there shows that we're we've got to come
[1:04:08] again
[1:04:09] with that same spirit that was on john
[1:04:11] he introduced the messiah
[1:04:13] he was greater than all the prophets
[1:04:15] he'd introduced it and we've
[1:04:16] we've got to come to a place again to
[1:04:18] something that's going to introduce the
[1:04:20] messiah
[1:04:21] and brother brahma was talking about in
[1:04:22] the pyramid you come to the seven steps
[1:04:24] and at the seventh step there was
[1:04:25] somebody there to introduce you to the
[1:04:27] king
[1:04:28] and he types that with john he says we
[1:04:29] need that same thing now and friends
[1:04:31] we've had that same thing now
[1:04:34] something to introduce the messiah when
[1:04:37] in the seventh step in the seventh
[1:04:39] church age
[1:04:40] and how will the people that's believing
[1:04:43] him know it unless they're constantly in
[1:04:45] the word
[1:04:46] to know what he is daniel said the wise
[1:04:49] shall know but the foolish the unwise
[1:04:51] wouldn't know
[1:04:52] they shall know their god now how he
[1:04:55] shall appear in the last days
[1:04:57] is to bring the people back to the word
[1:05:00] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:05:03] know her mate the revealed word
[1:05:06] so what is the revealed word our husband
[1:05:10] our mate who introduced us messiah
[1:05:14] one with the same spirit that was in
[1:05:16] john the spirit of elijah
[1:05:18] in the seventh step he come to usher us
[1:05:20] into the presence of the
[1:05:22] king what was the presence of what is
[1:05:23] the king the king is the revealed word
[1:05:26] our mate our husband
[1:05:30] and the message christ is the mystery of
[1:05:32] god revealed
[1:05:34] now you see the seals when he was in his
[1:05:36] mediatorial work back there redeeming
[1:05:38] but someday he comes forth to get this
[1:05:41] book that he's redeemed
[1:05:42] and all that's in this book would be him
[1:05:44] for that's the believer the words in the
[1:05:46] book
[1:05:46] and the word is him and all that's in
[1:05:49] that he come
[1:05:50] forth for this book of redemption whose
[1:05:51] names are written on the book before the
[1:05:53] foundation of the world
[1:05:54] when he was slain as a lamb and here he
[1:05:57] is today
[1:05:57] in his word manifesting the same thing
[1:05:59] he did there
[1:06:00] she can't recognize another headship
[1:06:04] no sir there's no bishop no nothing she
[1:06:06] recognizes one headship
[1:06:08] and that's christ christ is the word
[1:06:11] oh my i love that yes sir as the head
[1:06:13] was took up from the grave so
[1:06:15] must his body follow into eden therefore
[1:06:17] the body cannot recognize
[1:06:19] any other headship but the headship of
[1:06:22] the word
[1:06:24] so god because there was a weaker vessel
[1:06:27] amen this church you know when when
[1:06:31] when god took the man adam the first man
[1:06:33] and he pulled out of him
[1:06:35] a vessel that he was going to use to
[1:06:36] unlock the attributes in him he made a
[1:06:38] weaker vessel for redemptions purposes
[1:06:41] amen but when god struck christ and out
[1:06:43] of christ came the ingredients to make
[1:06:45] the church
[1:06:46] when that church was formed it was
[1:06:47] automatically a weaker vessel because
[1:06:50] that life came down to dwell in a
[1:06:52] tabernacle
[1:06:53] amen that had a carnal spirit and had a
[1:06:55] fallen nature
[1:06:56] amen in that that corn that that church
[1:06:58] by that carnal spirit
[1:07:00] took the word and took their own idea of
[1:07:02] the word and they fell away from their
[1:07:03] headship
[1:07:05] but god has brought back the church's
[1:07:07] headship
[1:07:09] so that we can come underneath the
[1:07:11] headship
[1:07:13] and underneath the headship of this word
[1:07:16] we can we can have power not our power
[1:07:20] his power how is the power going to be
[1:07:23] displayed
[1:07:24] the power the virtue what virtue virtue
[1:07:27] to submit
[1:07:28] virtue to surrender virtue to lay down
[1:07:31] at his feet and say cover me with your
[1:07:33] skirt
[1:07:34] i want to be under your headshed let's
[1:07:37] turn to ephesians chapter 5.
[1:07:50] ephesians chapter 5.
[1:07:57] and verse 22.
[1:08:04] ephesians 5 and 22 start there
[1:08:08] wives submit yourselves into your own
[1:08:10] husbands as unto the lord
[1:08:12] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:08:13] even as christ is the head of the church
[1:08:16] and he is the savior of the body
[1:08:18] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:08:20] christ so let the wise be to their own
[1:08:21] husbands and everything
[1:08:23] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:08:25] also loved the church
[1:08:27] and gave himself forward that he might
[1:08:29] sanctify
[1:08:30] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:08:33] by the word
[1:08:34] that he might present it to himself a
[1:08:36] glorious church not having spot or
[1:08:38] wrinkle or any such thing
[1:08:39] but that it should be holy and without
[1:08:41] blemish
[1:08:42] so want men to love their wives as their
[1:08:44] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:08:46] loveth himself for no man ever yet hated
[1:08:49] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[1:08:51] cherishes it
[1:08:52] even as the lord the church for we are
[1:08:54] members of his body
[1:08:55] of his flesh and of those bones for this
[1:08:58] cause shall a man leave his father and
[1:09:00] mother and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:09:02] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[1:09:05] a great mystery
[1:09:06] but i speak concerning christ in the
[1:09:08] church
[1:09:10] so when we talk about headship when we
[1:09:12] talk about submission
[1:09:14] it's not just about headship and
[1:09:16] submission it's about christ
[1:09:18] and his church in the message christ as
[1:09:21] the mystery of god revealed the prophet
[1:09:23] says but god's great mystery
[1:09:25] what the eternal god had as a mystery
[1:09:27] has now been unfolded in jesus christ
[1:09:29] they're given right down to his church
[1:09:31] what was once in god's mind is
[1:09:33] now in the body of christ
[1:09:36] jesus making love to the church his
[1:09:38] bride whispering
[1:09:39] secrets to her you know how you tell
[1:09:41] your wife things you know the little
[1:09:43] girl you're going to marry
[1:09:44] you love her so much you'll just tell
[1:09:46] her the secrets and get her up next to
[1:09:48] you and love you and everything
[1:09:49] you know how it is that's what god
[1:09:52] christ is doing to the church
[1:09:53] he is letting her know the secrets just
[1:09:56] the secrets
[1:09:56] not these flirters i mean his wife i
[1:10:00] want to ask you is god telling you
[1:10:01] secrets
[1:10:03] is god opening his word and he's is he
[1:10:05] showing you things
[1:10:06] that other ages haven't seen is he
[1:10:08] showing you things that you've never
[1:10:09] seen before
[1:10:10] is he whispering love secrets in your
[1:10:12] ears he's not doing that to the flirters
[1:10:14] he's only doing that to his wife
[1:10:17] and there's a reason that he's doing
[1:10:18] that friends because he's the headship
[1:10:20] the revealed word of this day
[1:10:22] is the headship that we submit ourselves
[1:10:24] under so he keeps revealing the word
[1:10:27] revealing the word revealing the word so
[1:10:30] that we can stay under his headship
[1:10:33] remember the devil first attacked the
[1:10:36] word
[1:10:37] to get her out from around the word so
[1:10:38] that he could attack her
[1:10:40] amen and as long as we stay under the
[1:10:42] headship of the word
[1:10:43] he can't get to us amen but the only way
[1:10:46] that he can get to us
[1:10:47] is he first has to attack the word amen
[1:10:49] and you have to let down on the word
[1:10:51] when you let down on the word and move
[1:10:53] outside the word then he can come and
[1:10:54] get you
[1:10:56] so what is the bridegroom doing today
[1:10:59] amen the bridegroom is here
[1:11:01] the revealed word is the headship over
[1:11:02] the church and he's here revealing love
[1:11:05] secrets to her
[1:11:06] because the love secrets is opening her
[1:11:08] eyes to the word
[1:11:09] so that when the devil comes to attack
[1:11:11] the word she says uh-uh
[1:11:13] my husband already showed me this tactic
[1:11:15] i saw it in esther i saw it in ruth i
[1:11:17] saw it in jezebel
[1:11:18] i'm not falling for that i
[1:11:22] saw what paul says amen i heard what
[1:11:24] peter says i'm not falling
[1:11:26] for that one devil that's the reason the
[1:11:28] bridegroom came in this day
[1:11:30] so that he would have a bride without
[1:11:31] spot or wrinkle
[1:11:34] every other one
[1:11:37] the word was attacked she used reasoning
[1:11:40] and moved away from the word then she
[1:11:42] was attacked
[1:11:44] but there's going to be one in this day
[1:11:47] a virtuous woman
[1:11:49] that will stay under the headship of the
[1:11:50] word
[1:11:52] brother mum says again in christ is the
[1:11:54] mystery god revealed
[1:11:56] now you can see now the end time message
[1:11:58] why it's rejected can you
[1:12:00] no denomination but the revelation of
[1:12:02] his mystery no denomination the
[1:12:04] revelation
[1:12:06] god is not known by the nomination he's
[1:12:07] known by revelation
[1:12:10] look god in his body christ and christ
[1:12:13] in his body the bride
[1:12:14] oh my god made manifest in christ
[1:12:17] christ made manifest in the bride and as
[1:12:20] god took from the body of adam the woman
[1:12:22] and she fell then god is took from the
[1:12:24] body of christ his flesh his body
[1:12:26] which is his word and is bringing a
[1:12:28] bride out that won't fall by
[1:12:30] denomination or creed
[1:12:31] no sir but she is coming back with pure
[1:12:35] unadulterated word of god being
[1:12:37] manifested
[1:12:38] i hope every man that hears this tape
[1:12:40] and every woman will understand that see
[1:12:42] she is the second eve but she is not
[1:12:44] breaking and spoiling her skirts of
[1:12:46] purity and holiness to her husband
[1:12:48] she'll stay with his word regardless of
[1:12:50] what anybody says
[1:12:51] you can have all the ecumenical moves
[1:12:53] you want to in all the affiliations
[1:12:57] this one's prophesied not to fall
[1:13:01] we talked about this before but she's
[1:13:03] prophesied not to fall
[1:13:05] not because god would look down through
[1:13:06] time and he'll say finally i've got a
[1:13:08] people on the earth that's better than
[1:13:10] the people that were here the generation
[1:13:11] before
[1:13:12] smarter wise or strong no that's not it
[1:13:15] there's a different thing that took
[1:13:16] place in this age and took
[1:13:18] place in the previous ages because now
[1:13:20] the bridegroom himself
[1:13:21] came down and the bridegroom is here
[1:13:23] whispering love secrets in her ear
[1:13:25] you realize adam was not deceived adam
[1:13:28] was not the weaker vessel
[1:13:29] the woman was the weaker vessel she was
[1:13:32] deceived
[1:13:33] if adam had been standing there
[1:13:35] whispering in her ear she would have
[1:13:36] never fallen for the tactics of the
[1:13:38] devil
[1:13:40] she she was there alone facing the devil
[1:13:44] and the devil was attacking the word
[1:13:45] and by reasoning she began to reason by
[1:13:47] the word and she come out from beyond
[1:13:49] the boundary of the word
[1:13:50] and then she was attacked and fell prey
[1:13:53] she was beguiled but adam was not
[1:13:57] deceived in the transgression
[1:13:59] so if adam would have been standing
[1:14:00] there whispering in her ear
[1:14:02] would she have fallen
[1:14:06] she fell because she had to open the
[1:14:08] door to release the attributes that were
[1:14:10] locked inside of god
[1:14:13] but god knew in the end time he would
[1:14:15] have one that wouldn't fall
[1:14:17] she's predestinated not to fall that
[1:14:20] this one fell
[1:14:20] this one fell this one fell this one
[1:14:22] fell but there's one predestinated not
[1:14:25] to fall
[1:14:25] so how is he going to keep her from
[1:14:27] falling she's still the weaker vessel
[1:14:29] so what's he going to do he's going to
[1:14:31] do something different in this day
[1:14:33] he's going to come down himself with his
[1:14:35] personal presence
[1:14:36] and he's going to be standing not next
[1:14:38] to her but inside of her
[1:14:40] and he's going to be whispering love
[1:14:41] secrets to her and no matter what the
[1:14:43] devil brings he's got a love secret to
[1:14:45] fight against it
[1:14:48] he's opening the word you realize he's
[1:14:50] opening the word day by day
[1:14:52] service by service tape by tape he's
[1:14:54] opening what's he doing
[1:14:55] he's making the bride an invincible army
[1:14:58] not because she's got some super mind
[1:15:00] but she's under the headship of the word
[1:15:02] and under the headship of the word
[1:15:04] he's got to go through the word first to
[1:15:06] get to you and if you stay under the
[1:15:08] headship
[1:15:08] he's not going to get to you
[1:15:11] the only way is for the weaker vessel to
[1:15:14] forget that she's a weaker vessel
[1:15:18] and start to think she can reason the
[1:15:20] word
[1:15:22] and she can figure out she can do and
[1:15:25] she can begin to act like jezebel
[1:15:28] but this bride's predestinated
[1:15:32] not to where does the power for
[1:15:35] overcoming come from
[1:15:37] it comes from submission submission to
[1:15:40] what
[1:15:40] submission to the headship that has come
[1:15:43] back in this day
[1:15:44] the revealed word let's read one
[1:15:47] scripture
[1:15:48] while the musicians come let's go to
[1:15:51] john
[1:15:52] chapter 8.
[1:15:56] john chapter 8 verse 31
[1:16:04] john chapter 8 verse 31
[1:16:09] then said jesus to those jews who
[1:16:11] believed on him
[1:16:13] if you continue in my word then you are
[1:16:16] my disciples indeed
[1:16:18] not if you started in his word but if
[1:16:21] you continue in his word
[1:16:24] then you are my disciples indeed and you
[1:16:27] shall know the truth
[1:16:29] and the truth shall make you free
[1:16:32] oh i've got no strength
[1:16:36] i've got no ability i'm not no super
[1:16:39] nothing
[1:16:40] but what we've been given is our
[1:16:41] headship back
[1:16:43] and if we can just submit ourselves
[1:16:45] under that headship
[1:16:47] then god will take the weaker vessel
[1:16:52] and he will use her for redemption
[1:16:56] remember death came
[1:16:59] by the woman but life
[1:17:03] also came by the woman the same vessel
[1:17:07] that brought death
[1:17:08] god used the same vessel to bring life
[1:17:10] and there was a hidden strength in the
[1:17:12] weaker vessel
[1:17:13] and the weaker vessel the hidden
[1:17:15] strength revolves around life
[1:17:17] amen because so she's weak and though
[1:17:19] she's timid and though she's softer than
[1:17:21] a man
[1:17:22] and she's not as as physically strong or
[1:17:24] capable as a man
[1:17:25] amen doesn't have the endurance of a man
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:28] i've never seen a man that could have a
[1:17:30] baby yet
[1:17:33] there's a hidden strength in the weaker
[1:17:36] vessel
[1:17:37] amen and it's so humble and so soft when
[1:17:40] jesus christ was
[1:17:41] was nailed to the cross it looked like
[1:17:43] there was no strength there
[1:17:44] amen but there was a hidden strength
[1:17:46] that the devil didn't understand
[1:17:47] and in this weaker vessel is a hidden
[1:17:49] strength that the devil doesn't
[1:17:51] understand
[1:17:52] it looks weak and it looks timid amen
[1:17:55] but that woman who's weak and
[1:17:57] not as strong as a man and not as
[1:17:58] durable and can't work as many hours
[1:18:00] amen when it comes to delivery time
[1:18:02] there's not a man on this planet that
[1:18:04] would trade places with her
[1:18:07] there's a strength that's laying there
[1:18:10] in her design
[1:18:12] and that strength has to do with
[1:18:14] bringing forth life
[1:18:16] and there's a bride on the earth in this
[1:18:18] day she doesn't have
[1:18:20] her own strength she doesn't have all
[1:18:22] she has is virtue
[1:18:24] the virtue to stay submitted to his word
[1:18:26] but there's a hidden strength laying
[1:18:28] there
[1:18:29] and it has to do with bringing forth
[1:18:31] christ in this day
[1:18:34] say god let me just stay submissive to
[1:18:37] you and humble
[1:18:39] use me for your glory
[1:18:42] amen let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:18:44] let's all stand and we'll pray
[1:18:46] let's all stand and then we'll pray lord
[1:18:49] jesus we thank you
[1:18:51] god we thank you for this day that
[1:18:53] you've put us on this earth lord
[1:18:56] and god you didn't leave us to ourselves
[1:18:58] and to our own strength and to our own
[1:19:00] abilities because we have none
[1:19:02] but you've chosen this day to take the
[1:19:06] weak things
[1:19:07] to confound the wisdom of the wise
[1:19:10] and those things that are not to bring
[1:19:12] the not the things that are
[1:19:14] and god you've collected a bride out of
[1:19:17] here and from over there and you've
[1:19:19] pulled us all together
[1:19:20] under your headship and there's a
[1:19:23] mystery laying in that weaker vessel
[1:19:25] lord that the world doesn't understand
[1:19:28] and the devil doesn't understand but god
[1:19:32] you're whispering
[1:19:32] love secrets in her ears you're keeping
[1:19:36] her under that headship under the
[1:19:37] protection of the word
[1:19:40] god let us stay under your word
[1:19:43] let us stay submitted and humble
[1:19:47] reverent help us be like esther to
[1:19:50] realize
[1:19:51] that our salvation is going to come from
[1:19:53] you
[1:19:55] that our strength lies in you not in the
[1:19:57] strength in our arms but the position
[1:19:59] that you've placed us in by your
[1:20:00] choosing
[1:20:02] you've chosen us and you've placed us
[1:20:04] and now if we can just respect you and
[1:20:06] humble ourselves before you show your
[1:20:08] reverence you have the power to deliver
[1:20:10] us you have the power
[1:20:12] to free us from haman let us show you
[1:20:15] the respect you deserve and stay
[1:20:17] submitted to your god
[1:20:19] reverent to your word submitted to your
[1:20:21] word humble before your word
[1:20:25] god we love you i pray god that you
[1:20:29] would take the weaker vessel in this day
[1:20:32] and by your power flowing through her
[1:20:35] would you do something wonderful lord
[1:20:38] what you've promised to do in this day
[1:20:41] help us god to keep surrendered unto you
[1:20:44] that you might work through
[1:20:45] us we as you bless us as we go from here
