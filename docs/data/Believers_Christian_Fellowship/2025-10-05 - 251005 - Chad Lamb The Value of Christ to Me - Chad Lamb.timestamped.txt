[0:00] Do you know what it is not to have one
[0:05] guilty feeling? Not to wonder where
[0:08] you're going when you die.
[0:12] Not condemned by the past. Not afraid of
[0:16] what tomorrow holds in store and know
[0:20] the reason why.
[0:23] Yes, that's just how it is when you go
[0:27] down in the water. For by faith you
[0:30] believe in what you've heard.
[0:34] It's no impossible dream you can start
[0:38] over clean
[0:41] when you're washed by the water of the
[0:44] word.
[0:47] Are you washed
[0:49] by the water?
[0:53] Washed by the water of the word.
[0:58] Are you washed
[1:01] by the water?
[1:04] Washed by the water of the word.
[1:09] It's like being born again with a whole
[1:13] new life to live. never having to look
[1:16] back to what you've been.
[1:20] Cuz according to the Lord, you become a
[1:24] new creation. And where he's concerned,
[1:28] never was no sin.
[1:31] For when God looks at you, he no longer
[1:35] sees a sinner, but a saint who's been
[1:39] washed white as snow.
[1:42] Not by anything we've done. By the blood
[1:46] of God's own son.
[1:49] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[1:53] Yes, I'm washed. Yes, I'm washed
[1:57] by the water.
[2:01] Washed by the water of the word.
[2:06] I am washed
[2:08] by the water.
[2:12] Washed by the water of the word. Verse
[2:16] three. It's like being born again with a
[2:20] whole new life to live, never having to
[2:24] look back to what you've been.
[2:27] Because according to the Lord, you've
[2:31] become a new creation. And where he's
[2:34] concerned, it never was no sin.
[2:38] For when God looks on you, he no longer
[2:42] sees a sinner, but a saint who's been
[2:46] washed white as snow.
[2:49] Not by anything we've done, by the blood
[2:53] of God's own son.
[2:56] Are you washed by the water of the word?
[3:01] Oh yes, I'm washed
[3:04] by the water.
[3:08] Washed by the water of the word.
[3:12] Yes, I'm washed
[3:15] by the water.
[3:19] Washed by the water of the word. So
[3:22] glad. So glad I'm wash
[3:26] by the water.
[3:30] Washed by the water of the word.
[3:36] Oh, I'm washed by the water.
[3:40] Washed by the water of the word.
[3:46] Now, let's go to the key of C.
[3:50] Oh, let the beauty of Jesus be seen in
[3:58] me.
[4:01] All his wonderful passion and purity.
[4:11] Oh thou spirit divine
[4:16] all my nature refine
[4:21] till the beauty of Jesus be seen
[4:28] in me once more.
[4:31] Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me.
[4:41] All his wonderful passion and purity.
[4:52] Oh thou spirit divine.
[4:56] Oh my nature in mind.
[5:01] Till the beauty of Jesus be seen in me.
[5:32] She was a virgin bride to be.
[5:37] And one night as she prayed quietly,
[5:42] the spirit of the Lord overshadowed
[5:46] her.
[5:49] And he said, "You'll conceive a child
[5:54] that sin cannot defile." And she said,
[5:59] "Be it unto me according to thy word."
[6:06] So she kept these things
[6:11] and pondered them deep within her heart.
[6:19] She believed the word,
[6:24] never one time felt desire to depart.
[6:33] The word has been born
[6:37] in Mary
[6:40] and I can see it being born in you and
[6:45] me.
[6:48] Now we're that virgin bride to be
[6:53] saved through the blood of Calary.
[6:58] In this time of darkness, we have come
[7:05] to manifest the anointed word.
[7:10] Oh, that we all have heard and I can see
[7:14] it being born in you and me.
[7:21] Though we kept these things
[7:26] and pondered them deep within our
[7:30] hearts.
[7:33] We believe the word
[7:38] never one time felt desire to depart.
[7:46] For the word has been born
[7:50] in Mary
[7:54] and I can see it being born in you and
[7:58] he.
[8:01] Oh yes, the word has been born
[8:06] in Mary
[8:10] and I can see it being born in you and
[8:15] me.
[8:24] And we bring praisees
[8:32] to you, Lord.
[8:40] Lifting
[8:41] holy
[8:43] heads we worship
[8:47] and
[8:49] adore.
[8:55] Sinners
[8:56] saved
[8:58] by grace.
[9:02] We bow
[9:04] before
[9:05] your face.
[9:10] offering
[9:11] nothing
[9:14] but praisees
[9:17] to you, Lord.
[9:24] Empty
[9:26] handed
[9:28] we come
[9:31] to the high holy throne. Oh,
[9:39] open inside
[9:42] with nothing to hide.
[9:47] We offer praisees
[9:53] and we now worship
[9:57] the name
[10:01] of the lamb that was slain.
[10:09] Asking
[10:10] nothing for us. We just bring you our
[10:16] love offering praise.
[10:20] Would you stand with me this morning?
[10:23] And we bring praisees
[10:30] to you, Lord.
[10:38] Lifting
[10:40] holy
[10:41] hands we worship
[10:45] and adore.
[10:52] Sinners
[10:54] saved
[10:56] by grace
[10:59] we bow
[11:01] before
[11:03] your face.
[11:07] offering
[11:09] nothing
[11:12] but praisees
[11:14] to you.
[11:21] And angels
[11:23] fold their wings
[11:29] as we boldly
[11:33] sing.
[11:36] Redeemed by the lamb
[11:39] now holy we stand.
[11:44] We're offering praisees
[11:50] and all our sin stains are gone.
[11:58] And we've been washed in the blood.
[12:06] Pure and rightous
[12:09] we come to the most holy one offering
[12:15] praisees.
[12:19] Oh, we bring praisees.
[12:26] is
[12:28] to you Lord.
[12:35] Lifting
[12:37] holy
[12:38] hands
[12:40] we worship
[12:42] and adore.
[12:49] sinners
[12:51] saved
[12:53] by grace.
[12:56] We bow
[12:58] before
[13:00] your face.
[13:04] Offering
[13:06] nothing
[13:09] but praisees
[13:11] to
[13:13] you.
[13:17] As brother Chad comes this morning, how
[13:21] preious
[13:23] is your love for me.
[13:28] It is
[13:30] beyond my understanding.
[13:37] Oh Lord,
[13:39] I want to realize
[13:42] the meaning of the price
[13:47] which you paid to save
[13:51] us.
[13:52] The very
[13:55] heart you guide through me
[14:00] inspires
[14:02] my heart with humble worship.
[14:08] I could
[14:10] earn your love, my deeds,
[14:14] his grace, my spirit needs,
[14:18] and your redeeming favor.
[14:25] unto you I'll sing my song.
[14:33] Lifting up your name,
[14:37] Lord Jesus.
[14:40] Wondous love is pure and strong.
[14:47] Casting away my sin,
[14:51] changing me from
[14:56] I stand
[14:58] amazed of what you do.
[15:04] You hold a vessel that's been broken.
[15:12] The image
[15:14] Lord you want to see
[15:18] reflecting you in me
[15:21] the true and holy to
[15:27] you shall not break
[15:35] that's bruised
[15:37] it's garden this our God.
[15:41] Oh, you heal my body and my soul.
[15:48] Your love will make me whole
[15:52] by your restoring power.
[15:59] Unto you I'll sing my soul.
[16:07] lifting up your name,
[16:11] Lord Jesus.
[16:14] Wondous love is pure and strong,
[16:21] casting away my sin.
[16:24] You're changing me from within.
[16:29] You are faithful
[16:33] to me.
[16:37] You are faithful,
[16:39] Lord.
[16:43] You are faithful.
[16:50] Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[16:54] Oh Lord Jesus, we're so glad that you
[16:56] are faithful.
[16:58] God, you've already tried man under
[17:01] conditional covenants and man could not
[17:03] remain faithful.
[17:05] But you brought us into an unconditional
[17:07] covenant
[17:08] in which you remain faithful, Lord. And
[17:11] we're so thankful for that faithfulness,
[17:13] Lord. For when we couldn't, you can.
[17:17] When we failed, you never fail. when we
[17:20] couldn't keep our end. You've kept yours
[17:22] all along, Lord, and sealed it by your
[17:24] own blood, Lord, so that it's
[17:26] irrevocable.
[17:28] God, we thank you for this time we get
[17:30] to spend together, Lord. We ask that you
[17:32] would come now and break the bread of
[17:34] life for us, Lord. As we've come to hear
[17:36] from you, we've come to worship you.
[17:38] We've come to bring glory to your name.
[17:40] And we're asking, God, that you would
[17:42] give us a fresh portion of mana from
[17:44] heaven. God, that that that bread of
[17:47] life that we need so desperately, Lord,
[17:49] to walk in this life. May you give us a
[17:52] fresh portion this morning. And may it
[17:54] strengthen us and sustain us, Lord. God,
[17:57] I pray you'd have your way as you take
[17:59] prereeminence among us. And may you have
[18:01] your way with this vessel of mind, Lord,
[18:03] as we've come to that portion of the
[18:05] service where we open your word and look
[18:07] into it, Lord. and we don't want to do
[18:09] so with intellect and the ability to
[18:10] read and natural eyesight. But God,
[18:13] we're asking for more than that, Lord.
[18:14] That you supply the portion we cannot.
[18:16] That you bring a spirit of revelation
[18:18] and understanding on your word. That you
[18:21] would give us the eyes sav that would
[18:22] help us to see. And God, may we take
[18:25] your word deep into our hearts and our
[18:27] souls. Lord, may we become one with it.
[18:30] And may it become a manifestation in our
[18:32] lives. We love you. We ask your blessing
[18:34] over all that's said and done. May it be
[18:37] to your pleasure, according to your
[18:39] will. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[18:43] Amen. God bless you. We're going to have
[18:46] you all take your seats for just a
[18:47] moment. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[18:50] Amen. I have a baby dedication this
[18:52] morning. Amen. So, if Brother Riley and
[18:55] Sister Abigail Sanders want to bring
[18:57] their little baby girl forward, we'd be
[18:59] really, really, really pleased to help
[19:01] them dedicate this baby to the Lord.
[19:04] Amen. and they named her Mildrid and
[19:06] call her Millie. Millie Rose Sanders. I
[19:10] looked up the name Mildred and it means
[19:13] gentle strength. I thought that's
[19:16] beautiful. Amen. What a good name. And
[19:18] so we thank God for this little gift
[19:22] that he's given to them.
[19:26] Oh, come here, Millie.
[19:30] Amen. Let's all bow our heads together.
[19:33] Dear heavenly father, we're so grateful,
[19:36] Lord, for your gifts are good. Your
[19:39] blessings are abundant. And God, we're
[19:42] not deserving of them, but we're
[19:43] grateful for them. And God, you saw fit
[19:46] to give this little life of Millie Rose,
[19:49] Lord, to this mother and this father.
[19:52] And God, they desired to commit her and
[19:54] dedicate her back to you, recognizing
[19:56] where she comes from. And God, they also
[19:59] want to commit themselves as stewards
[20:01] over this little life. And and as they
[20:03] commit themselves, Lord, I pray that you
[20:05] would bless them abundantly with the
[20:08] spirit of wisdom and understanding to
[20:09] know how to care for and raise this
[20:11] little life. May you touch our brother
[20:13] Riley, Lord. May you always be a
[20:15] provider and a protector. May Millie
[20:17] grow under his shelter, under his
[20:19] branches. May he be the oak for her to
[20:21] grow under. May he lead her and guide
[20:23] her in the ways that are right. God, we
[20:26] pray you bless her sister Abigail. May
[20:28] she nurture and care for little Millie.
[20:30] May you give her wisdom to know what she
[20:32] needs at all times. And God, may she be
[20:34] an example to her of Christian
[20:36] womanhood. And may Millie follow in her
[20:38] footsteps. And God, I pray that you'd
[20:40] help us as an assembly to be supportive
[20:42] and caring to help this family as they
[20:45] grow in your likeness and in your image.
[20:47] May we support them, care for them. May
[20:49] we be a shelter that they can rest under
[20:51] in weary times. May we be a support to
[20:53] them when they need it. And may your
[20:55] blessings abound in little Milliey's
[20:56] life. May you put a hedge of protection
[20:59] around her, Lord, that the fiery darts
[21:01] of the enemy will never get to her. May
[21:03] she grow, Lord, in grace and in
[21:05] understanding and knowledge. And God,
[21:07] may you give her eyesight to see from an
[21:09] early age. May she follow after you all
[21:11] the days of her life. May she never
[21:13] experience what it's like to go astray,
[21:15] but may she follow you, the great
[21:16] shepherd, from the time she's a child.
[21:19] And God, may you prosper her life, and
[21:21] may you get glory and honor in her life
[21:23] as her your purpose and her is
[21:25] fulfilled. We ask it in Jesus Christ
[21:28] holy name. Amen.
[21:32] Praise God. Yeah, that's right.
[21:36] God bless you. God bless you. Amen.
[21:42] Praise the Lord. That is a lot of fun.
[21:46] Thank you musicians for not being
[21:48] dismissed. I was out of order. God bless
[21:50] you. But you can be dismissed now. Amen.
[21:54] It's nice to have some backup and help
[21:55] when you need it. Amen. Uh we can all
[21:58] stand together and take our Bibles. I
[22:02] just want to welcome home the Gorillo
[22:03] family. It was good to see Brother
[22:05] Franco and Sister Amy and Pipa as well
[22:07] as Maria and Vidy. Amen. They were away
[22:10] in Italy and so we're so glad to have
[22:11] them home. And uh I told Brother Franco,
[22:14] I can't wait to say, "Brother Franco,
[22:16] bring up my PowerPoint." Amen. It'll
[22:18] just feel good to have him back in
[22:20] place. Amen. We also want to say we
[22:23] enjoyed the wedding very much yesterday
[22:24] and thankful all to you who were able to
[22:26] make it and so happy for the Bartum
[22:28] family and for what God has done for
[22:30] them and that was quite a blessing.
[22:33] Also, we've got quite a few visitors
[22:34] here today. So, we want to make sure you
[22:36] all are welcome and we want to make you
[22:38] feel welcome. There's a group of saints
[22:40] here from Omega Tabernacle and that's in
[22:42] D, Ohio. That's the church that brother
[22:44] Steven Gby's pastoring. Brother Steven
[22:46] and a portion of the church had to go to
[22:48] a funeral. So instead of having a
[22:51] service with just a small portion left,
[22:53] uh he suggested that as the rest of the
[22:55] congregation travel over here to join us
[22:57] in the service. So God bless you all.
[22:59] It's so good to have you with us. We
[23:01] just ask that the Lord will bless you.
[23:03] Also, uh it's good to have brother Don
[23:05] and sister Lauren Gurgle with us from
[23:07] South Carolina. God bless you. They were
[23:09] here Wednesday, but they slipped in and
[23:11] after the service started and I I miss
[23:13] greeting them. So God bless you. And I
[23:16] saw Brother Paul and Sister Norah come
[23:17] in. God bless you. It's good to have you
[23:19] guys back with us again. Also, just want
[23:22] to say it's been a pleasure to have
[23:24] brother Michael and Sister Mary and
[23:25] Quinland with us. They go home on
[23:27] Tuesdays, so we'll greatly miss you, but
[23:29] it's been good to have you. I mean, when
[23:31] they say they're coming for three, four
[23:33] or five weeks, it's like, oh, we got
[23:34] plenty of time, and before you know it,
[23:36] it's over with, but we've enjoyed the
[23:39] time that we got to share together. And
[23:41] I think this is Brother Aaron Yes. Am I
[23:43] right? God bless you, brother Aaron.
[23:44] It's good to have you and your family up
[23:45] with us as well. and anybody else who's
[23:48] visiting, God bless you. We want you to
[23:50] feel right at home. See, brother Arley
[23:51] and brother Andy, God bless you. It's
[23:53] good to see you guys again. Amen. So, it
[23:55] feels like a homecoming. Amen. It feels
[23:57] like family is here. So, praise the
[23:59] Lord. It's a good day to be together. I
[24:02] just want to let you know also that
[24:03] we've got the communion and feet washing
[24:05] this afternoon. And so, we'll announce
[24:08] that again at the end of service. Uh
[24:10] while we're standing together, let's
[24:12] open our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11.
[24:18] Hebrews chap 11
[24:22] and we will go to verse 24.
[24:28] Amen. Just want to share with you this
[24:31] message came to me in a unique way
[24:34] sometimes and I love it like this when
[24:36] God interrupts our plans. You know I had
[24:38] another plan and that plan got
[24:40] interrupted and the interruption of the
[24:42] plan sometimes causes you to lose sleep.
[24:44] you know, you're up in the middle of the
[24:46] night and I was up in the night a couple
[24:48] nights ago and then all of a sudden
[24:50] things began stirring and God put a
[24:52] scripture in my mind and no matter which
[24:54] way I rolled over to sleep, all I could
[24:56] see was that scripture. And so I tossed
[24:58] and turned for a bit, but it God just
[25:01] started working that scripture in my
[25:02] heart and my mind. And so I just want to
[25:04] share with you the things that that God
[25:06] was sharing with me. So just be pulling
[25:08] and receive and then what God has. Uh
[25:11] Hebrews 11:4
[25:16] says, "By faith, Moses, when he was come
[25:18] to years, refused to be called the son
[25:20] of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather
[25:23] to suffer affliction with the people of
[25:25] God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin
[25:27] for a season, esteeming the reproach of
[25:30] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[25:32] in Egypt, for he had respect unto the
[25:35] recompense of the reward. By faith he
[25:38] forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of
[25:40] the king. For he endured as seeing him
[25:43] who is invisible. May God bless you as
[25:46] you take your seats. May God bless us as
[25:49] we look into the word. So this is the
[25:52] scripture that kept coming to me in the
[25:54] night in the early early hours of the
[25:57] morning. And and as I began to look at
[25:59] that, there was just almost like it
[26:01] began to highlight just a portion there
[26:04] that we knew. We all know we know this
[26:06] scripture. We've read it so much, but
[26:07] there's just a part that became
[26:09] magnified to me. So, I just want to look
[26:11] at it again. Hopefully, you have your
[26:12] Bible still open. He said, uh, verse 24,
[26:16] "By faith, Moses, when he was come to
[26:18] yours, refused to be called the son of
[26:20] Pharaoh's daughter." Listen, that's a
[26:23] pretty prestigious title. That's a
[26:25] pretty good place to be. If you were in
[26:28] Egypt in that day when Egypt was the
[26:30] world power and Pharaoh's Pharaoh was
[26:32] the richest and most powerful man in the
[26:34] whole world at that time. Amen. To be
[26:36] the son of Pharaoh's daughter and have
[26:38] Pharaoh as a grandfather. Hey, that that
[26:41] would be a wonderful thing. But he
[26:42] refused that,
[26:45] &gt;&gt; choosing rather
[26:47] to suffer affliction with the people of
[26:49] God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin
[26:52] for a season. I think what becomes
[26:54] amazing in this scripture is the
[26:56] contrast.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; And God does these things on purpose to
[27:00] draw our attention. It's not contrasting
[27:02] between, let's just say, an average Joe
[27:05] who's decided to give up a a a median
[27:08] wage earning job to go and do something
[27:10] for the kingdom or somebody who's just,
[27:13] you know, not well known and doesn't
[27:15] really he's just the average Joe, the
[27:16] regular guy on the block and all of a
[27:18] sudden he decides to change his course
[27:20] of life. And amen. This is not the
[27:22] contrast that the scripture is showing
[27:24] us. is showing the contrast from
[27:26] somebody who's going to the top all the
[27:28] way to the top as high almost as high as
[27:30] you can possibly go in this world and
[27:33] now he's choosing to suffer affliction
[27:35] with the lowest of the lowest the
[27:37] slaves.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; And he's refusing this to take this.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God, friends. I mean,
[27:47] God does this. God lays these things in
[27:49] the scriptures for a purpose. Amen. to
[27:51] get our attention so we can see these
[27:53] things. Now it says now in verse 26,
[27:57] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[27:59] riches than the treasure in Egypt, for
[28:01] he had respect unto the recompense of
[28:04] the reward.
[28:06] Now, thank you, Franco, for bringing up
[28:08] my PowerPoint.
[28:11] I didn't get the chance to say bring up
[28:13] my PowerPoint. He ruined it. Thank you
[28:16] for bringing up my PowerPoint, Brother
[28:18] Franco. Amen. So I want to talk about
[28:22] the subject the value of Christ to me.
[28:25] The value of Christ to me
[28:28] &gt;&gt; and look at the scriptures as we go.
[28:31] This word reproach he esteemed the
[28:33] reproach of Christ greater treasure. The
[28:36] reproach means shame, disgrace or
[28:39] disapproval that is often directed at
[28:41] God's people or Christ stemming from a
[28:44] broken covenant, unfaithfulness or
[28:47] contempt for God's people and their
[28:49] righteousness. It can also mean the act
[28:51] of expressing such contempt such as
[28:54] through slander, mockery, mockery, uh
[28:57] reviling language. So if we look at
[28:59] this, there's a couple reasons that you
[29:02] can have a reproach. You can be a
[29:04] reproach against Christ because you
[29:05] reproach his word. You broke the
[29:07] covenant or you've been unfaithful. But
[29:09] in this situation, it's contempt for
[29:11] God's people in their righteousness.
[29:13] And it's the act of expressing such
[29:16] contempt. Amen. Through slander,
[29:18] mockery, or reviling language. This was
[29:21] the reproach of Christ. And Moses
[29:24] esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
[29:27] treasure. I want to read that together
[29:30] because I want to get the language
[29:31] right. Esteeming the reproach of Christ
[29:33] greater riches than the treasure in
[29:36] Egypt. Brother Brandham says it this way
[29:38] in the message leadership. He says,
[29:40] "Esteeming the reproach to be called a
[29:42] fanatic, holy roller," or something like
[29:45] that, you know.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; And listen, I when I come back to the
[29:49] scripture, here's the part that that
[29:50] that that dropped into my heart that I
[29:53] couldn't get away from. It did not say
[29:56] that that Moses esteemed Christ greater
[29:59] riches.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that he esteemed Christ
[30:03] greater riches than all the treasured
[30:06] Egypt. He esteemed the reproach of
[30:08] Christ. Listen,
[30:11] that's a big statement, friends.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because most of the people in the
[30:15] world can esteem God and esteem Christ
[30:18] greater riches than anything else. But
[30:20] it wasn't that he esteemed Christ
[30:21] greater riches. He esteemed the reproach
[30:24] of Christ greater riches. He thought it
[30:27] was so much better to be mocked for
[30:30] following Christ than anything else. and
[30:32] he esteemed that mocking that making fun
[30:35] of that being identified with the lowest
[30:37] of the lowest that to him was greater
[30:40] riches.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; I mean that's what I was rolling around
[30:45] in my bed thinking it dropped in my
[30:47] heart. It was I mean we I've always
[30:50] looked at that scripture and thought
[30:51] yeah he he he loved Christ better than
[30:53] he loved the riches he loved he love and
[30:55] not that's all true statement there's
[30:57] nothing wrong with that but that's not
[30:58] what the Bible said exactly it didn't
[31:00] say he esteemed Christ greater riches he
[31:03] esteemed God greater he didn't he he
[31:06] esteemed the reproach of Christ greater
[31:09] riches
[31:11] &gt;&gt; oh praise God and listen he forsook
[31:14] everything
[31:16] &gt;&gt; brother Brenham says in the message
[31:18] leadership. He said Moses was a rich
[31:21] young ruler to become Pharaoh. He was
[31:24] Pharaoh's son and was heir to the
[31:26] throne. And he looked out to the
[31:27] impossible, a bunch of mudbers, a bunch
[31:30] of slaves. But by faith, he saw the
[31:32] promise of God through the word that his
[31:34] people would sojourn in a strange land
[31:36] for 400 years, but would be brought out
[31:39] by a mighty hand. And he esteemed that.
[31:42] What did he esteem? that promise that
[31:46] they would be brought out with a mighty
[31:47] hand. And he esteemed that brother says,
[31:49] "Hallelujah, greater riches than all the
[31:52] treasure of Egypt. For he forsook Egypt,
[31:54] not knowing where he was going. He was
[31:56] led by Christ. He forsook and he had his
[32:00] foot on the throne." And he could have
[32:02] been the next Pharaoh in Egypt, but he
[32:03] esteemed the reproach of Christ. the
[32:06] reproach to be called that odd one, to
[32:09] be called that fanatic, to take his
[32:12] place with the mudbers and the fanatics
[32:14] because he seen that the hour that the
[32:16] scripture was promised to be fulfilled
[32:18] was there then. And oh church, wake up.
[32:22] Can't you see the same thing tonight?
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; The hour that's been promised is on us.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ
[32:31] greater riches than all the fellowship
[32:32] of anything. It takes father and mother,
[32:35] church, anything else. Follow the
[32:37] leadership of the spirit.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "What what was there in that
[32:41] day is here now." Amen. What were they
[32:44] coming to? They were coming to the
[32:45] promise of the word being fulfilled. And
[32:47] he looked out Oh, praise God. He looked
[32:50] out at a bunch of people that were part
[32:52] of the promise. And everybody else saw
[32:54] them as slaves, but he saw them as part
[32:56] of the promised word.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could turn with me, uh,
[33:02] turn with me to Exodus chapter 2.
[33:15] Exodus chapter 2
[33:19] verse 11.
[33:23] Exodus 2:11. And it came to pass in
[33:25] those days when Moses was grown that he
[33:27] went out into his brethren and looked on
[33:30] their burdens. And he spied an Egyptian
[33:32] smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren,
[33:35] and he looked this way and that way. And
[33:36] when he saw that there was no man, he
[33:38] slew the Egyptian and hid him in the
[33:40] sand. I want to go back to verse 11. And
[33:43] it said, "It came to pass in those days
[33:45] when Moses was grown." That word grown
[33:48] does not mean he reached adulthood.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Uh I'll pull it up here in the
[33:52] concordance. That word grown means to
[33:56] become great or important,
[33:59] to promote, to make powerful, to praise,
[34:01] to magnify, to do great things. So when
[34:04] Moses had become a great man, when he
[34:08] had moved into a powerful position, not
[34:10] grown as he's an adult, grown that he's
[34:13] come to a status of position and power
[34:15] and greatness, that's when he went to go
[34:18] look upon his brethren.
[34:21] And and it says and and when Moses was
[34:24] grown, he went out unto his brethren and
[34:27] looked on their burdens.
[34:30] When Moses come to the height,
[34:34] &gt;&gt; when he come to position and power and
[34:36] prestige and glory, when he came to
[34:39] that, he didn't go out and look at
[34:42] slaves.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; He went out and looked at his brethren.
[34:50] He didn't identify himself with
[34:52] Egyptians. He identified himself with
[34:54] the people of the promise.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; And the people of the promise were beat
[34:58] down and rejected and cast away and
[35:01] slaves.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; But he called them brethren, not the
[35:05] Egyptians that he had lived with all of
[35:07] his life and grown up in their house.
[35:09] Amen. And had the power and had the
[35:10] prestige and had the money and had
[35:12] everything. He looked upon his brethren.
[35:15] Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; And then he decided
[35:20] that that reproach, that mockery, that
[35:24] being made fun of, that being cast down,
[35:26] because they were in the promise and
[35:28] covenant of Abraham and the promise of
[35:31] redemption, he he viewed that reproach
[35:34] greater treasure than everything he had.
[35:37] Now that he was grown and come to wealth
[35:39] and power and prestige and magnificence,
[35:41] he wanted that. I want I want to be
[35:44] identified with the slaves. I want to be
[35:46] identified with the castaways. I want to
[35:48] be identified. Why? Because they're part
[35:50] of the word. They're part of the
[35:52] covenant. They're part of the promise.
[35:53] And listen, friends, I don't think that
[35:56] was Moses humanity that made him want to
[35:58] take that position. There was something
[36:00] inside driving Moses that was greater
[36:03] than humanity. cuz show me a human
[36:05] being. Amen. That wants to go from the
[36:07] pinnacle of human life down to the
[36:09] lowest of human life and says this down
[36:12] here is more valuable to me than this up
[36:14] here. That's not a human being. That's a
[36:17] seed gene of God on the inside that's
[36:19] got an attraction to the word of God. He
[36:21] may not have understood it himself.
[36:23] Nobody around him may have been able to
[36:25] understand or comprehend. Why would you
[36:27] throw away so much? But to him, he was
[36:30] throwing away nothing because he
[36:32] esteemed the reproach. greater riches
[36:34] than the treasure.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[36:41] we are not perfect people.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; We're all the perfect people. Please
[36:47] stand up.
[36:53] But you know what? They're the people of
[36:54] God.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] Moses goes out to his brethren, the
[37:00] people of the promise, the people of
[37:02] God.
[37:03] and he defends one who's being beaten by
[37:06] an Egyptian. And the next day, another
[37:09] one of his brethren is beating on
[37:10] another one of his brethren. And he
[37:12] smites him. He goes to correct them and
[37:14] he says, "Who made you ruler over us?"
[37:16] And listen, they they these probably
[37:18] weren't easy people to deal with.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; But they were his brethren,
[37:25] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to be identified with
[37:26] them, and he wanted to bear the same
[37:28] reproach that they bore.
[37:31] Oh, praise God. Help us to see what God
[37:35] sees.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; That's my desire, friends, is to see
[37:40] what God sees.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's Let's go on. I think I don't
[37:47] know. I got to go back and see where I'm
[37:48] supposed to be. Oh, God is so good.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Let Yeah. Let's go over here. Turn with
[37:55] me to 1 Corinthians 10.
[38:15] 1 Corinthians chapter 10
[38:19] in verse one.
[38:21] Moreover, brethren, I would not that you
[38:24] should be ignorant, how that all our
[38:26] fathers were under the cloud, and all
[38:28] passed through the sea, and were all
[38:30] baptized into Moses in the cloud and in
[38:32] the sea, and did all eat the same
[38:35] spiritual meat, and did all drink the
[38:37] same spiritual drink. For they drank of
[38:40] that spiritual rock that followed them,
[38:42] and that rock was Christ.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; But with many of them, God was not well
[38:46] pleased, for they were overthrown in the
[38:49] wilderness. Now these things were our
[38:51] examples to the intent we should not
[38:53] lust after evil's things as they lusted.
[38:57] So now we we we come here to the the
[39:00] Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthian
[39:01] church and he begins to tell them
[39:05] he says what was going on in the
[39:07] wilderness. What what were they
[39:08] partaking of in their journey through
[39:10] the wilderness? And he begins to show,
[39:12] amen, that they they were they were in
[39:15] the realms of Christ, that they were
[39:17] following after Christ, that they were
[39:19] feeding on Christ, and they were
[39:20] drinking from Christ.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Let's look at this again. He says verse
[39:25] two, "And were all baptized unto Moses
[39:28] in the cloud and in the sea."
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. What does that cloud represent?
[39:36] &gt;&gt; That cloud was Christ. the logos, the
[39:39] pillar of fire, cloud by day, fire by
[39:42] night. Amen. That was Christ and he was
[39:45] the one leading them along. They were
[39:46] baptized in the sea. Amen. They they
[39:49] were those were the waters of separation
[39:51] separating them from the land of Egypt
[39:53] and crossing. Amen. What's he talking
[39:55] about? He says they had their baptism.
[39:57] They were baptized in the cloud. Amen.
[39:59] And they were baptized in the sea. Amen.
[40:02] Listen. They didn't know they were being
[40:04] baptized. They didn't know what was
[40:05] going on. They just knew the
[40:07] supernatural was happening in their
[40:08] life. Amen. But what was overshadowing
[40:10] them? Christ. Who parted the waters?
[40:12] Christ. Amen. What was happening? They
[40:14] were being baptized, separated, washed
[40:16] away from Egypt, and brought into Amen.
[40:19] the journey to a promised land. And then
[40:21] it says, let's let's keep looking now.
[40:25] And they did all eat the same spiritual
[40:28] meat.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the physical
[40:33] mana. That's right. He's not speaking of
[40:36] the mana that they gathered and ate.
[40:39] That mana was representing something.
[40:41] What was mana representing? The mana was
[40:44] representing Christ.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; The cloud represented Christ. The mana
[40:48] represented Christ.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; We got it.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Verse four. And did all drink the same
[40:58] spiritual drink.
[41:01] He's not talking about literal water. I
[41:05] mean, going down uh their throat. He
[41:07] says spiritual drink, not natural drink.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; The natural drink was representing
[41:13] spiritual drink. And they did all drink
[41:16] the same spiritual drink. For they drank
[41:18] of that spiritual rock that followed
[41:22] them. And that rock was Christ.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Is it What kind of rock is he talking
[41:29] about? A spiritual rock.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; A spiritual rock that followed them
[41:34] through the wilderness. A spiritual
[41:36] rock. Amen. It It wasn't as though,
[41:38] Amen. that this rock had legs and this
[41:40] big boulder. Amen. That was split with a
[41:42] cleft in it. Amen. H kept getting legs
[41:45] and crawling out in the night. He's
[41:47] saying this was a spiritual rock that
[41:49] followed him. The real rock represented
[41:52] Amen. The the the natural rock
[41:54] represented the real rock. This was a
[41:56] representation. Amen. And they had the
[41:58] natural form. And the natural form was
[42:00] smitten. And in the in the smitten
[42:02] place, and the cleft of the rock came
[42:04] lifegiving water, testifying that Jesus
[42:07] Christ would come, the rock, the true
[42:09] revelation of God himself, and would be
[42:11] smitten. Amen. And where he was smitten
[42:13] would outflow. Amen. Water and blood,
[42:15] lifegiving flow would come out of that
[42:18] rock. Amen. And they were all drinking,
[42:20] testifying of a rock that was coming.
[42:22] But because this was representing that,
[42:24] Amen. When they were walking through the
[42:26] natural walk spiritually, this was all
[42:29] Christ manifesting. Christ manifesting,
[42:31] Christ manifesting, Christ manifesting.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Christ was the rock that followed them.
[42:38] Amen. And and you we begin to look at
[42:41] this and what Paul's saying, Paul is
[42:43] telling us that Christ was in the Exodus
[42:46] journey.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ was in Egypt.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:54] right now.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; How else could Moses bear the reproach
[42:57] of Christ if Christ wasn't there? Amen.
[42:59] Christ was there and he wanted to bear
[43:02] the reproach of Christ. Amen. And and
[43:04] I'm I just want to tell you Christ is
[43:06] here today. Amen. And what's most
[43:08] valuable to us, friends, what is
[43:10] becoming the most valuable thing to us?
[43:13] Don't say the most valuable thing to me
[43:15] is Jesus Christ, but I want the reproach
[43:17] of Jesus Christ to be more valuable than
[43:20] anything else I can put my hands on.
[43:23] Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the worst of the worst and
[43:26] the lowest of the lowest and the
[43:28] rejection and the mockery and the
[43:29] misunderstanding and everything that
[43:31] goes with serving Christ in this day. I
[43:33] want to value that more than I value
[43:35] anything that I can have in this world.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Anybody can say
[43:43] I value Christ more.
[43:47] But can you value the reproach of Christ
[43:51] &gt;&gt; more?
[43:53] Amen.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:59] So the the the spiritual meat, the food
[44:05] was Christ.
[44:07] It was represented by mana. But the real
[44:10] spiritual food that they were eating was
[44:12] Christ.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; They the real spiritual water they were
[44:17] drinking was Christ.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] In in most of the world, uh, the
[44:23] Christian world, they begin to look back
[44:25] at Jesus Christ, the man of Nazareth,
[44:28] the body that was born through the
[44:29] Virgin Mary, and they put all of Christ
[44:31] into that package. Well, that's true.
[44:34] All of Christ was in that package. But
[44:36] don't fail to see, Christ was before
[44:38] that manifestation, and Christ is still
[44:40] here today.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what Jesus says in John 6.
[44:49] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[44:50] verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you
[44:53] not that bread from heaven,
[44:56] but my father giveth you the true bread
[44:58] from heaven."
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; For the bread of God is he which cometh
[45:02] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[45:04] the world. Jesus is telling them that
[45:07] bread was natural bread. Amen. But my
[45:10] father giveth you the true bread.
[45:14] And the true bread is he that cometh
[45:15] down from heaven, which is Christ, and
[45:18] giveth life unto the world. In John
[45:21] 6:41, the Jews then murmured in him
[45:23] because he said, I am the bread which
[45:25] came down from heaven.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; I am the bread. You're looking back at
[45:30] mana and you're rejoicing. But listen,
[45:32] you're missing what it really
[45:33] represents. I am the bread.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And and and listen, just like mana, oh,
[45:39] praise be to God. Just like mana, Amen.
[45:42] was a bread that you had to eat in the
[45:44] day it fell. Amen. Jesus Christ is the
[45:47] bread that came down from heaven. And
[45:49] he's the bread that you have to eat in
[45:51] the day that it falls. Amen. You
[45:53] couldn't carry it over from one age to
[45:55] another, from one dispensation to the
[45:56] next because it would spoil. Amen. There
[45:58] was only one place, amen, that that word
[46:01] would keep for eternity, and that's in
[46:02] the presence of shikina glory.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it came into the earth to be
[46:07] manifest day after day after day, amen.
[46:10] at the rising of the sun, they would
[46:12] recognize that new mana had come down
[46:14] from heaven and they would collect a
[46:15] day's worth and eat that, but they
[46:17] couldn't keep it over. Amen. So, he is
[46:19] the bread that came down from heaven.
[46:21] That representation was there to show us
[46:23] that you must eat Christ in the day the
[46:26] bread falls.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not worm eating maggoty bread from
[46:32] a previous day, but today's bread. Amen.
[46:34] And when you eat today's bread, Amen.
[46:37] God brings us into a higher order and a
[46:39] higher relationship and sustains our
[46:41] life. Amen. And if if if you're one of
[46:43] God's children, then by his spirit,
[46:45] you're made a king and a priest. And if
[46:47] you're made a priest, then you can go in
[46:48] behind the veil. And when you go behind
[46:50] the veil, you can eat the eternal
[46:52] portion of Christ that's never spoiled.
[46:54] The thought of God from before the
[46:56] foundation of the world, and you can
[46:58] feast on that.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. I am the bread which
[47:04] came down from heaven. Yes.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; They were they were eating bread, but
[47:11] that bread was representing Christ, and
[47:14] they were eating the spiritual bread.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; In verse 48, he says, "I am the bread of
[47:23] life. Your fathers did eat mana in the
[47:26] wilderness and are dead. This is the
[47:29] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[47:31] a man may eat thereof and not die."
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am the living bread which
[47:36] come down from heaven. If any man eat of
[47:39] this bread, he shall live forever. And
[47:41] the bread that I will give is my flesh
[47:44] which I will give for the life of the
[47:46] world.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Oh man, this this is amazing because now
[47:50] he's starting to break it down and says,
[47:52] I listen, I'm the bread. They're their
[47:55] their human minds could not understand.
[47:57] How are you the bread that came down
[47:59] from heaven? How how are you the true
[48:01] bread? We don't understand what's
[48:02] happening. We've heard the stories all
[48:04] of our life. We know the word to mean
[48:06] this. And Jesus is taking deeper in the
[48:09] word and say, "You saw the
[48:10] representation, but you didn't catch the
[48:12] meaning. You didn't catch the real life
[48:14] behind the manifestation in the
[48:16] wilderness." Cuz the life behind that
[48:17] was Christ, the word coming to
[48:20] fulfillment.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; And then they're like, "What? What does
[48:28] this mean? What does this mean that he's
[48:30] the bread?" And then he he goes further.
[48:32] I am the living bread.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; If any man eat of this bread, he shall
[48:38] live forever. And the bread that I will
[48:40] give is my flesh.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Which I will give for the life of the
[48:45] world. You talk about a mental short
[48:47] circuit.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; All the fuses popped right then because
[48:51] they're looking at a human being.
[48:53] They're looking at God in flesh, the man
[48:55] form, and he's telling them, "Listen,
[48:57] the word th this bread that I give is my
[49:00] flesh." Amen. which I will give for the
[49:03] life of the world. And you've got to eat
[49:05] that. Eat what? Eat me. How am I going
[49:08] to eat him? Amen. The Bible forbids this
[49:11] kind of fortaking.
[49:21] understand what's going on because right
[49:23] in front of them is Christ. They see a
[49:25] man, but there's Christ.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; John 1:14, he says, "And the word was
[49:32] made flesh
[49:35] and dwelt among us."
[49:38] &gt;&gt; What did he say that he would give for
[49:40] the life of the world? He would give his
[49:43] flesh.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And his flesh is the bread.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; And what is his flesh? His flesh was the
[49:50] word that was made flesh.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; See, this is where the the communion
[49:58] service in the Catholic realms, amen,
[50:01] begin to fail because they see this as
[50:04] literal. And now they have to make some
[50:07] way that if you eat bread, you eat his
[50:09] flesh, you can live. So they have to
[50:11] have a ceremony in which the priest
[50:13] under certain incantations and certain
[50:15] orders, he can he can have the power to
[50:18] literally transform the little wafer and
[50:21] bread into the physical body of Jesus
[50:23] Christ. So that when you eat that bread,
[50:26] Amen. This is Catholic doctrine. When
[50:27] you eat that bread, you're actually
[50:29] eating a part of Christ and Christ is
[50:31] becoming one with you. That's why you
[50:33] got to continually go back to the priest
[50:35] and go back to mass. That's why they
[50:37] have mass every time because mass is
[50:39] where you go and partake of Christ. And
[50:41] if you don't have the church and you
[50:43] don't have the priest, you can't have
[50:44] the bread.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; And they've turned it into something
[50:49] literal and begin to control the people
[50:51] by that. Amen. But they missed the whole
[50:53] point. Amen. There's not a priest who
[50:55] can do a little ceremony and say some
[50:57] words in Latin and ring a little bell
[50:59] and turn this wafer that man made into
[51:01] the literal body of Jesus Christ that if
[51:03] he comes and puts it on your tongue and
[51:05] you take it in yourself, now you've got
[51:07] Christ abiding in you. Amen. That's
[51:09] wrong. Amen. It wasn't flour mixed with
[51:12] water. Amen. And a little oil. That's
[51:14] not what that wafer is all about. Amen.
[51:16] It's the word. It was the word that was
[51:18] made flesh. Amen. And it was the flesh
[51:20] of the word. When the word, all that God
[51:22] was, he poured in the Christ. When the
[51:24] fullness of the thought became word and
[51:26] the word all became a man, it was the
[51:28] flesh of Jesus Christ. And he said,
[51:30] "Unless you eat my flesh," what is his
[51:33] flesh? It's the manifested word on
[51:35] display
[51:37] so that we can still eat his flesh,
[51:40] friends. Amen. Not going to a church and
[51:42] taking a wafer that a priest prayed
[51:44] over. Amen. but taking the word, the
[51:47] mana that's falling in our day and
[51:49] receiving it into ourselves because his
[51:52] word is still being made flesh in this
[51:54] hour.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:59] Bearing the reproach of Christ.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; John 6:52.
[52:09] The Jews therefore strove among
[52:12] themselves, saying, "How can this man
[52:14] give us his flesh to eat?" Then Jesus
[52:16] said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say
[52:18] unto you, except you eat the flesh of
[52:21] the Son of Man and drink his blood, you
[52:23] have no life in you."
[52:26] Oh my, it just keeps getting worse.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; For the intellectual believer, it just
[52:30] keeps getting worse.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And except you eat the flesh of the S
[52:34] and drink his blood,
[52:37] you have no life in you.
[52:39] Who so eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my
[52:42] blood hath eternal life, and I will
[52:45] raise him up at the last day. For my
[52:47] flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is
[52:50] drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh
[52:53] and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me,
[52:55] and I in him.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Not a wafer from a Catholic priest.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; But if you eat his flesh and you drink
[53:03] his blood, then then you dwell in him
[53:06] and he dwells in you. Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; As the living father sent me, and I live
[53:11] by the Father, so he that eateth me,
[53:14] even he shall live by me. This is that
[53:17] bread which came down from heaven, not
[53:19] as your fathers did eat mana and are
[53:21] dead. He that eateth of this bread shall
[53:24] live forever.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; How many want to eat this bread
[53:32] &gt;&gt; and drink this blood?
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:38] I just want to I just want to take you
[53:41] back to the scripture in 1 Corinthians
[53:44] 10.
[53:46] In 1 Corinthians 10,
[53:49] they ate his flesh and drank his blood.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to 1 Corinthians 10.
[54:10] Verse 2, 10 and two. And were all
[54:12] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[54:14] the sea, and that all eat the same
[54:16] spiritual meat,
[54:19] and that all drink the same spiritual
[54:21] drink, for they drank of that spiritual
[54:23] walk rock that followed them. And that
[54:25] rock was Christ.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; They were feeding on Christ.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Spiritually they were receiving
[54:34] the word for their day. They were
[54:36] walking in the word for their day. They
[54:38] were feasting on the mana that was
[54:40] falling as that word was becoming flesh.
[54:43] Amen. God says, "I will I will come and
[54:46] I will bring them out with a mighty
[54:47] hand. I'll be their redeemer." And there
[54:49] was a promise of a redeemer. And he
[54:50] comes down to Moses and he says, "Moses,
[54:52] I've heard the cry of my people and I've
[54:54] come down to deliver them. Now come, I'm
[54:56] sending you." Amen. And he was he was
[54:58] now what was Moses? Moses was fleshing
[55:01] out the promised word that God was going
[55:03] to be a redeemer. And how was God going
[55:05] to be a redeemer? He was being a
[55:06] redeemer in Moses. And Moses was
[55:09] becoming the flesh of the word.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God punished him so
[55:16] much. Every time they rejected Moses,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; his sister and brother, there was a
[55:21] punishment. When Cora, Dayan, and Abram,
[55:23] there was a punishment. Why? Because
[55:25] Moses became the word fleshed out in his
[55:28] human flesh. That promise of a redeemer,
[55:30] that promise of a mighty God coming to
[55:32] deliver, it was all wrapped up in
[55:34] working through Moses. And Moses was
[55:36] calling for flies. It wasn't Moses's
[55:38] power calling for flies. That was Christ
[55:40] working through Moses calling for flies.
[55:42] Christ through Moses calling for frogs.
[55:44] Christ through Moses bringing the
[55:46] plagues. Christ through Moses lifting
[55:48] the rod. That wasn't a man. That was God
[55:51] working through the man.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; And it was the word becoming flesh. And
[55:55] now they were walking in the promise of
[55:56] the word, going to the fulfillment of
[55:58] the promise, which was a promise that
[56:00] they would inherit the land that was
[56:02] promised to Abraham and to his seed. And
[56:04] now they're walking in the wilderness
[56:05] journey, walking as a manifestation of
[56:08] the word because this word has to come
[56:10] into manifestation. There has to be a
[56:12] seed of Abraham that will go in and
[56:15] possess the land because it was
[56:16] promised. Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; And when they were walking and receiving
[56:20] the word made flesh, they were drinking
[56:22] a spiritual drink. And they were eating
[56:24] a spiritual meat. Amen. And they were
[56:27] drinking from that rock. And that rock
[56:29] was Christ.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:39] We want to bear the reproach of Christ.
[56:43] But that's not friends in our day. is
[56:46] not just believing that Jesus Christ
[56:48] came 2,000 years ago, died on Calvary,
[56:51] shed his blood for our redemption. Amen.
[56:54] That the world believes
[56:58] &gt;&gt; there's not a reproach in believing
[57:00] that.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; If you go to work and say you believe
[57:05] that, who mocks you and makes fun of
[57:07] you?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Who calls you ridicul? I mean, it
[57:11] happens in certain pockets, but not not
[57:13] worldwide. Amen. Not that's not that's
[57:15] not made. But you go tell them that you
[57:17] believe God sent a prophet in our day to
[57:19] fulfill Malachi 4 and the revelation of
[57:21] Luke 17:30 and that we believe that the
[57:24] opening of the seals, Amen, brought
[57:26] Christ back to earth. And now he's
[57:27] dwelling in a many member body called
[57:29] his bride. And it's those people who
[57:31] have received this message have received
[57:32] Christ for their day. And that's where
[57:34] Christ is working. That's where Christ
[57:36] is tabernacle. That's where the proper
[57:38] place of worship now is in Christ and
[57:40] Christ is in his people. You start
[57:42] sharing that and there's a reproach for
[57:44] Christ.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; They'll start calling you a brandite and
[57:48] they'll call you following a man and
[57:50] they'll tell you and then you tell them,
[57:51] "We don't believe in the traditional
[57:53] Trinity doctrine as as as propagated by
[57:55] the Catholic Church, but we believe God
[57:57] is one and he operates in three
[57:58] manifestations. We baptize in the proper
[58:00] Christian baptism of the Lord Jesus
[58:02] Christ and no baptism outside this is
[58:05] recognized in the scripture." Then
[58:07] you'll start bearing a reproach for
[58:08] Christ. Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Not by saying I'm a Christian. There's
[58:13] not a great reproach for that. But you
[58:14] start telling them that I'm feasting on
[58:17] the mana falling from heaven today and
[58:19] I'm believing the word for my day. The
[58:21] word that's fleshed out in this hour.
[58:23] And there's a reproach.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; There's a reproach for that Christ.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And friends, I count that greater riches
[58:35] than anything in this world. Amen. to be
[58:37] mocked for believing the word to be
[58:39] rejected. Amen. When we come to the
[58:41] message, we were rejected by family. We
[58:43] were misunderstood. We were separated
[58:45] from the ones we loved. But I count it a
[58:48] blessing in my life to have found
[58:50] Christ.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And if it brought separation, I didn't
[58:54] want separation. But with separation
[58:55] come, I would rather have this than
[58:57] that.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We left jobs. We left home. We
[59:03] moved. Many of us move to places and we
[59:05] can't understand why we're moving, why
[59:07] we're selling out, why we're getting rid
[59:08] of properties and beautiful homes and
[59:10] the things that we had known and the
[59:12] places that we had grown up. Amen. What
[59:14] were we moving for? Amen. Christ was
[59:16] drawing us.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; We wanted to drink from the well. We
[59:20] wanted to eat from the from the fresh
[59:22] mana that was falling.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And how many times you tell people that
[59:27] I'm moving? What are you moving for? I'm
[59:29] moving to go to church.
[59:33] And they say, "What's wrong with you?"
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Chad Gaines works in Columbus.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he decided to live halfway
[59:43] between
[59:44] Mary'sville, could commute to work, but
[59:47] he still couldn't have the fellowship
[59:50] with the living word,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; So, he made a decision a couple years
[59:55] ago to move to Lima
[59:59] and drive to work.
[1:00:02] every day.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Why did he come? He wanted to be where
[1:00:08] the word was fleshed out.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; He told me, he said, "I can either drive
[1:00:13] to work or drive for fellowship. I'd
[1:00:15] rather live where there's fellowship and
[1:00:16] drive to work." I say, "God bless you,
[1:00:18] brother.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; I'd rather to me the reproach of Christ,
[1:00:22] I esteem it greater riches than than
[1:00:24] saving gas money and saving my time on a
[1:00:27] commute and saving all of that."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We got Anna and Wesley
[1:00:33] Godfrey here. Ann, she's she's left
[1:00:36] home. She's left the place she grew up.
[1:00:38] She's left Connecticut that she knows so
[1:00:40] well. Amen. She's left the convenience
[1:00:41] of going to have coffee with a friend.
[1:00:43] Why did she leave that? Because of
[1:00:45] Wesley.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; It's not us, friends. Don't Don't get
[1:00:49] confused. She didn't come here for us.
[1:00:51] She came here for him.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; But she esteemed life with him. greater
[1:00:59] riches than everything she had to leave.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Proving her love for this man
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and all. Can I do that for Christ? Amen.
[1:01:07] Can I give up and separate Amen from the
[1:01:10] things that I that were dear to me once?
[1:01:12] Can there become something that becomes
[1:01:13] more dear to me than anything else?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul then comes and tells us
[1:01:24] what Jesus had said the night of the
[1:01:27] Passover. He said, "When he had given
[1:01:28] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:01:30] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:01:33] you.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; This do in remembrance of me."
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; After the same manner also, he took the
[1:01:40] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[1:01:42] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:01:45] This to you as often as you drink it in
[1:01:48] remembrance of me." I never intended to
[1:01:51] preach this because this is communion
[1:01:52] Sunday. It just happened, friends. Thank
[1:01:55] God. We take the word as it comes as God
[1:01:58] gives it to us.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; But Jesus is taking the bread and
[1:02:03] breaking it. And he's breaking that
[1:02:05] bread and said, "This is my body which
[1:02:07] is broken for you. Do this in
[1:02:09] remembrance of me."
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said when we come to
[1:02:11] communion and we take that broken bread,
[1:02:14] it reminds us of Christ's body. Amen.
[1:02:16] The word made flesh being broken and
[1:02:19] torn for you and I. Amen. Because he's
[1:02:21] paying the price of redemption as he's
[1:02:23] laying down his life for our salvation.
[1:02:25] and we come in remembrance, but we come
[1:02:27] to where the bread is broken and the
[1:02:30] bread is torn. And he said, "This bread
[1:02:32] is me."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; He's doing it symbolically, friends.
[1:02:37] He's not doing it literally. He said,
[1:02:39] "I, my body, the the body of the word,
[1:02:42] the word made flesh, the word of God
[1:02:45] that's made flesh in my body is going to
[1:02:47] be bruised and torn and broken for you."
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I want you to come together
[1:02:53] and I want you to take bread and tear it
[1:02:55] to remember what I've done for you. And
[1:02:58] if you feast, amen, not on the bread,
[1:03:00] amen, the literal bread, but you feast
[1:03:03] on the bread of my body, which is the
[1:03:05] word made flesh. Amen. Do this. Amen.
[1:03:07] Because then you have life.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Then he took the cup. He said, "This cup
[1:03:12] is a new testament in my blood." Because
[1:03:14] without the shedding of blood, there's
[1:03:16] no remission of sins. He had to have a
[1:03:18] blood to seal the covenant. But now it
[1:03:20] had to be human blood because it was a
[1:03:22] man who fell, Adam. It had to be a man
[1:03:24] who could restore and shed blood. But
[1:03:26] that blood, the Bible tells us, the
[1:03:28] blood represents the life. Amen. And he
[1:03:30] says, "Now take this, take this uh uh
[1:03:33] blood, this great this wine. Take this
[1:03:36] is the blood. This you do as often as
[1:03:38] you drink it in remembrance of me." And
[1:03:40] now he tells us to come together and
[1:03:42] take the wine. And brother Brandham
[1:03:44] said, "We don't do grape juice. We don't
[1:03:46] do this and that and the other." Amen.
[1:03:48] We take real wine because real wine has
[1:03:51] a preservative. Amen. It can last. It
[1:03:53] gets better with age. It doesn't get
[1:03:54] weaker. It gets stronger. And it's got
[1:03:56] life in it.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And it's a representation of receiving
[1:04:00] the life of Christ. Amen. We feed on his
[1:04:03] word and we receive his life. And as we
[1:04:05] feed on his word and receive his life,
[1:04:07] we have his life.
[1:04:10] And when we come to communion, it's
[1:04:12] representing that that we are
[1:04:14] continually feeding on the word and
[1:04:16] we're continually receiving of his life.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Continually.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Not just a one-time event, not just one
[1:04:25] something that happened a long time ago,
[1:04:28] not just something that happened 2,000
[1:04:30] years ago. Amen. But I'm still feeding
[1:04:32] on the word. I'm still receiving this
[1:04:34] spiritual meat. I'm still receiving this
[1:04:36] spiritual drink from the spiritual rock
[1:04:39] which is Christ that is still following
[1:04:41] his people today. Don't you think that
[1:04:44] rock disappeared in the wilderness
[1:04:45] journey? That rock is still following
[1:04:47] his children today because it's the rock
[1:04:49] that supplies everything you need. It's
[1:04:51] the rock of revelation that gives you
[1:04:53] the drink. It's the rock of revelation
[1:04:55] that sustains us along the journey.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; That rock hasn't went anywhere.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; No, sir. because it's a spiritual rock
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; and that rock is Christ
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; and that rock is every bit here today in
[1:05:09] our journey as it was in that day.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; He comes in invisible union that he says
[1:05:18] what is sin? Sin is unbelief. Unbelief
[1:05:21] in what? The word. Unbelief in God which
[1:05:24] is the word pure, unadulterated. Oh
[1:05:28] hallelujah. Leaving soon for the skies.
[1:05:32] Amen.
[1:05:34] standing ready. Think your garments
[1:05:36] washed by the water of the bleeding
[1:05:39] word.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; The word became blood.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; When did the word become blood? When it
[1:05:44] was made in the flesh.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus's flesh. The word bled for you and
[1:05:49] you were washed in bleeding word. The
[1:05:51] word bleeding. The life of God in the
[1:05:53] word. And the word was bled for you.
[1:05:56] what you might be washed from the filth
[1:05:58] of these prostitutes and be cleaned and
[1:06:00] sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:06:02] of the word and makes your mind and
[1:06:05] heart stayed on God and on his word.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; So the word is still washing us in the
[1:06:14] blood.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; It's still cleansing us from sin. We're
[1:06:20] still receiving the blood as we receive
[1:06:24] the bleeding word. What is the bleeding
[1:06:26] word? The fresh kill for today.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; The fresh meat, the fresh mana that's
[1:06:31] falling from heaven day by day. The
[1:06:33] portion for this hour, that portion has
[1:06:36] life on the inside. And that life on the
[1:06:38] inside is the blood. And the life is
[1:06:40] cleansing us and washing us and washing
[1:06:42] all our sins away by what? By Christ
[1:06:45] today.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:06:50] and forever. How is he the same
[1:06:52] yesterday, today, and forever? What has
[1:06:54] Jesus Christ been? How was he Jesus
[1:06:57] Christ yesterday? He was Christ in the
[1:06:59] wilderness journey.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And what he was there, he's the same
[1:07:03] today. But in the wilderness journey, we
[1:07:05] saw a pillar of fire and we saw a cloud
[1:07:06] and we saw a prophet. We saw all of
[1:07:08] that. Amen. But now today, he's Jesus
[1:07:11] Christ. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:13] forever. Amen. And then we saw that same
[1:07:15] Christ in one man, Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:07:18] Amen. The the the lamb of God. We saw
[1:07:20] him there. Amen. But we're still seeing
[1:07:23] Christ today
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; cuz he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:26] forever. How is he the same yesterday,
[1:07:28] today, and forever? Noah did something
[1:07:31] different than Moses. Abraham's
[1:07:33] manifestation was different than
[1:07:34] Moses's. Amen. Solomon's was different.
[1:07:36] What? How is he the same? Because he's
[1:07:38] always been and always will be. The word
[1:07:41] made manifest in every day. That's how
[1:07:44] it was. Christ in Noah, Christ in
[1:07:46] Jeremiah, Christ in Moses, Christ in
[1:07:49] you.
[1:07:50] Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Because it's wherever that man is
[1:07:54] falling fresh. It's wherever that
[1:07:56] bleeding word, that fresh word is
[1:07:58] producing the life of Christ. Amen.
[1:08:00] That's where he's at. That's where you
[1:08:02] come in contact with Christ. That's
[1:08:04] where you feed.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God sent a prophet.
[1:08:11] That's why God brought us the message.
[1:08:13] That's why these things have happened in
[1:08:14] this day. Amen. So we can come back in
[1:08:16] contact with a living Jesus Christ
[1:08:19] today.
[1:08:21] Amen.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And so now we're feeding
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; on the spiritual meat.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; As we feed on the word, we're eating the
[1:08:34] mana
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; and we're feeding on Christ.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; When we're drinking, Amen. from the
[1:08:42] fountain of revelation.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Christ pouring out his life unto us and
[1:08:47] we're receiving the life of the word.
[1:08:49] Amen. As we're receiving that, we're
[1:08:51] receiving Christ. We're eating and
[1:08:53] drinking Christ.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it, brother.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Because in Moses's day in the Exodus
[1:08:59] journey, they ate and drank Christ.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for the word of God.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; So thankful for this message.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; In the message, we would see Jesus. He
[1:09:16] says now but we have to find his nature.
[1:09:21] I'm sorry.
[1:09:24] Yeah. We have to find his nature. What
[1:09:28] he was. No. I'm sorry. Don't read that.
[1:09:30] Stop.
[1:09:37] Yeah.
[1:09:40] Okay. Now I know where I'm at. It's
[1:09:43] okay. Now you can read.
[1:09:46] Now, but we have to find his nature and
[1:09:48] what he was. Now, we all know and all
[1:09:51] Bible readers will agree that the pillar
[1:09:53] of fire that followed Israel in the
[1:09:54] wilderness or they followed the pillar
[1:09:56] of fire rather that that was the angel
[1:09:58] of the covenant that talked to Moses in
[1:10:00] the burning bush. That same pillar of
[1:10:02] fire, you agree with that? We all do.
[1:10:04] Well, who is the angel of the covenant?
[1:10:07] Christ. Moses forsook Egypt, esteeming
[1:10:10] the reproach of Christ greater treasure
[1:10:12] than that of Egypt. See, and now when he
[1:10:14] was here on earth, that pillar of fire
[1:10:16] was made flesh, dwelt among us. When he
[1:10:19] was here on earth, he said, "I come from
[1:10:21] God and I go to God."
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Now, remember yesterday, today, see, he
[1:10:27] come from God from the pillar of fire.
[1:10:30] He goes back to God. Now, after his
[1:10:32] death, burial, and resurrection, Saul of
[1:10:33] Tarsus on his road down to Damascus to
[1:10:36] arrest the Pentecostal people on his
[1:10:38] road down there. What happened? a pillar
[1:10:40] of fire, a light struck him down. Nobody
[1:10:43] else saw it. He saw it, but his eyes out
[1:10:46] out of uh out for a season. It was so
[1:10:49] real to him when the rest of them
[1:10:50] standing there couldn't see a thing. But
[1:10:52] it was so bright to him, it put his eyes
[1:10:54] out. And he said, "Saul, Saul, why
[1:10:56] persecutest thou me?" And he said, "Who
[1:10:59] are you, Lord?" Now listen, I am Jesus.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; I am Jesus. Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And it's hard for you to kick against
[1:11:09] the pricks. You remember that? Well,
[1:11:11] here he is. That same pillar of fire
[1:11:13] that was.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon brings it right to his
[1:11:16] day. Amen. Amen. He brings it right.
[1:11:18] Amen. He brings it right to the baptism
[1:11:21] on on the on the Ohio River in 1933 when
[1:11:25] the pillar of fire came down. Amen. The
[1:11:27] picture in Houston, Texas, where the
[1:11:28] pillar of fire came down. night after
[1:11:30] night when the pillar of fire would move
[1:11:32] around and the pillar of fire was seen
[1:11:33] and photographed and witnessed to and
[1:11:35] moving amongst them. He's saying he's
[1:11:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:11:39] and forever. And here Paul gets an
[1:11:42] amazing lesson as he saw going down to
[1:11:44] persecute the church and all of a sudden
[1:11:46] he sees the pillar of fire and brother
[1:11:47] Brandham said he called it Lord because
[1:11:49] he would have never called anything that
[1:11:51] wasn't God Lord and he recognized that
[1:11:53] pillar of fire is the same thing from
[1:11:55] the Old Testament and he knew it was
[1:11:57] God.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And that pillar of fire spoke to him and
[1:12:01] said Saul Saul why persecutest thou me?
[1:12:03] And he said who are you Lord? He said I
[1:12:06] am Jesus whom you persecute. And Paul
[1:12:10] wasn't touching the man that was born
[1:12:12] from the Virgin Mary. He wasn't touching
[1:12:15] that body, that form, but he was
[1:12:17] persecuting Jesus just the same. Because
[1:12:20] in that day, Jesus was in a many
[1:12:22] membered body. Then when he was
[1:12:24] persecuting the many membered body, he
[1:12:26] was fighting the word, arresting the
[1:12:28] word, rejecting the word,
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; the word that was being made flesh.
[1:12:36] And Jesus come to identify who it was he
[1:12:38] was persecuting.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He thought it was men and women of
[1:12:42] various ages and degrees and status in
[1:12:43] life and and then the households and
[1:12:46] different ones and ignorant and some
[1:12:47] learned and some priest and
[1:12:50] he didn't realize it was Jesus. That's
[1:12:52] right
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; in another form.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; But the pillar of fire came to him to
[1:12:57] awaken him to the fact of who this was.
[1:13:00] And then Paul, amen, was converted.
[1:13:04] His natural eyes were closed so his
[1:13:06] spiritual eyes could come open
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and he began to eat of this spiritual
[1:13:11] meat and drink of this spiritual water.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's how Paul could know who Christ
[1:13:18] was. That's why Paul could identify him
[1:13:21] in the Exodus journey because of this
[1:13:24] encounter he had on the road to
[1:13:25] Damascus.
[1:13:27] He understood who it was
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; and how it worked.
[1:13:31] Amen. Brother Brandon makes this
[1:13:34] statement here in the anointed ones at
[1:13:35] the end time said, "I wasn't the one
[1:13:37] that appeared down on the river."
[1:13:40] Well, it appeared down on the river when
[1:13:42] he's baptizing the 17th person. And now
[1:13:44] a ball of fire comes down and rest over
[1:13:46] him and makes a declaration just as John
[1:13:48] the Baptist was sent to forrun his first
[1:13:50] coming that your your message will
[1:13:52] forrun his second coming. And he said,
[1:13:54] "I wasn't the one that appeared down in
[1:13:55] the river. I was only standing there
[1:13:57] when he appeared.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these
[1:14:02] things and foretells these things that
[1:14:04] happens as perfect they are. I'm only
[1:14:06] one that's near when he does it.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; I was only a voice that he used to say
[1:14:11] it. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I
[1:14:14] just surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:14:17] through. It isn't me. It wasn't the
[1:14:19] seventh angel. Oh no. It was the
[1:14:21] manifestation of the son of man. It
[1:14:24] wasn't the angel. his message. It was
[1:14:26] the mystery that God unfolded. It's not
[1:14:29] a man. It's God. The angel was not the
[1:14:32] son of man. He was the messenger from
[1:14:34] the son of man. The son of man is
[1:14:36] Christ.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He is the one that you're feeding on.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Are you still eating spiritual meat? Are
[1:14:45] you still eating Christ? When Christ
[1:14:47] looked at his disciples when he looked
[1:14:48] in John chapter 6 and said, "Unless you
[1:14:50] eat my flesh, you have no life in you."
[1:14:53] Amen. What are you feeding on? You're
[1:14:55] feeding on He Christ is the one that
[1:14:59] you're feeding on.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man, a man, his
[1:15:03] words will fail. But you're feeding on
[1:15:04] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:15:08] man.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; What does the term body word mean? It
[1:15:12] means all the way back in John 1. Amen.
[1:15:14] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:15:17] among us. It was the fleshing out of the
[1:15:19] word and that become the body word that
[1:15:21] that they were to feed on.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And in this day, the word has become
[1:15:28] flesh.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And brother Benham said, "The son of man
[1:15:35] is Christ.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; He's the one you're feeding on."
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; So, what do I need to be eating?
[1:15:45] This word,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; this message of the hour,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; this word that's been delivered through
[1:15:52] a prophet in the end time that's been
[1:15:54] given to us is Christ.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; It is our meat.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; It is our drink.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; It sustains us in our journey. It gives
[1:16:05] us overcoming life and ability. This is
[1:16:09] the word. This is Christ that we're
[1:16:11] feeding on.
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And the reproach of that,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; is greater riches than all the treasures
[1:16:22] of Egypt.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; It's greater to me.
[1:16:26] You know, it's amazing that they'll call
[1:16:28] us Branommites.
[1:16:30] And that doesn't offend me one bit
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; because I never met a Wesleyan who gets
[1:16:36] offended being called a Wesleyan.
[1:16:39] Yeah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Never met a Lutheran that was really mad
[1:16:42] cuz you called him a Lutheran.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; So, Brandomite is not a derogatory term
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; when you know who he is. We don't
[1:16:51] consider ourselves Brandommites. We're
[1:16:54] Christians.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if somebody calls me a brand,
[1:16:58] I'm not going to get all hot under the
[1:16:59] collar and correct them and tell them
[1:17:00] you're all wrong.
[1:17:02] Is it wrong? I mean, you're not mad if I
[1:17:05] say you're a Lutheran. You're a
[1:17:06] Lutheran.
[1:17:09] Because the Lutheran recognized God was
[1:17:11] leading them into something else.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Problem is they stopped with Luther.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Problem is they stopped with Lesie. And
[1:17:18] many times the problem is we stop with
[1:17:19] brother Brandham.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; But we're supposed to go on into Christ.
[1:17:24] Amen. And feed on this word that was
[1:17:26] brought through that vessel.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; But I would rather bear that reproach.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Than anything else in life.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; I I I had a minister one time call me.
[1:17:37] Amen. We we had a homeschool group that
[1:17:39] was uh using a church facility. Amen.
[1:17:42] And that somebody uh uh got a church age
[1:17:44] book and the church age book got to the
[1:17:46] pastor and the pastor called me and he
[1:17:49] says, "I'm troubled about the things
[1:17:51] that I'm reading here and what I'm
[1:17:52] learning about uh William Brandom and we
[1:17:54] don't want you to use our facility
[1:17:56] anymore." So I started talking to him.
[1:17:58] He says, "Listen, I'm not at all shy to
[1:18:01] tell you that what you believe by most
[1:18:03] of the Christian world is considered
[1:18:05] heresy.
[1:18:07] Yeah.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And he was talking about baptism in
[1:18:09] Jesus' name and oneness to the Godhead.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yeah, I've heard that
[1:18:14] before."
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And Paul said, "In the way that is
[1:18:20] called heresy is the way that I worship
[1:18:22] the God of my fathers." So call it
[1:18:24] heresy all you want. They did to Paul.
[1:18:26] And that didn't trip up Paul. He said,
[1:18:28] "In the way that's called heresy, it's
[1:18:30] not heresy, but they call it heresy."
[1:18:32] But he knew what ground he was standing
[1:18:33] on and he knew who he was feeding from.
[1:18:35] And he wasn't ashamed to bear the
[1:18:37] reproach.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; He wasn't ashamed of his chains
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; because his chains, he was chained for
[1:18:45] the testimony of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:18:47] Because he was bearing the word and it
[1:18:49] didn't bother him a bit. And he even
[1:18:51] commended one church. Amen. He says,
[1:18:53] "You haven't been ashamed of me in my
[1:18:55] bondage.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; I would I would rather bear the
[1:18:59] reproach." Listen, that day that was a
[1:19:02] reproach against the church. Amen. All
[1:19:04] of a sudden, Paul, Amen, Paul is now in
[1:19:06] prison. He's been imprisoned. He's been
[1:19:08] jailed. And before he was jailed, there
[1:19:10] was all kinds of rumors about him from
[1:19:11] from all kinds of different groups.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Now, he winds up in jail. And all the
[1:19:16] believers don't know what to do. Listen,
[1:19:18] that was a scandal in that day.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; But there were people there that were
[1:19:23] willing to bear the reproach of Paul.
[1:19:25] There were those who sent him funds.
[1:19:26] There were those who stood by him. There
[1:19:28] were those who received his letters.
[1:19:29] There were those who still believed he
[1:19:31] was the messenger of the age and the
[1:19:32] apostle to the Gentiles. Regardless of
[1:19:34] what the world labeled him and the
[1:19:36] bondage he was in and the prison
[1:19:38] sentence he was in, they were willing to
[1:19:40] bear the reproach
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; esteeming the reproach of Christ. Why?
[1:19:46] Because Paul was fleshing out that word
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; and they were willing to stand with him.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; To me, you can call brother Ben whatever
[1:19:58] you want to call him.
[1:20:00] You can say he made up stories that he
[1:20:03] wanted people to like him. You can say
[1:20:05] he got birthdays wrong and details
[1:20:07] wrong. I don't care.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not that I don't care. It
[1:20:11] hurts me that you you you know, people
[1:20:13] will defame somebody, a man of God, but
[1:20:16] I'm willing to bear that reproach.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to bear the reproach. You
[1:20:21] you you may think, Amen, that we're
[1:20:23] uneducated and we don't know the Bible
[1:20:25] very well and we listen to a man who
[1:20:27] can't pronounce the long words in his
[1:20:29] Bible. I'm willing to bear that reproach
[1:20:31] and I esteem that greater riches. I'd
[1:20:33] rather stand beside, Amen, that
[1:20:35] ministry. Amen. And I'm not talking
[1:20:37] about the flesh, man. I'm talking about
[1:20:39] the ministry that came through. I'd
[1:20:40] rather stand alongside that and be
[1:20:42] called whatever I'm going to be called
[1:20:44] than to be the king of the whole wide
[1:20:46] world and have every bit of wealth.
[1:20:47] Amen. Because that is all that matters
[1:20:49] to me. Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, when Christ is made
[1:20:54] flesh and dwelling in a many membered
[1:20:56] body, listen, he's in a ragtag bunch of
[1:20:59] people from every walk of life. Amen.
[1:21:01] And some of us are good-looking and some
[1:21:03] of us are not.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Some of us are educated, some of us are
[1:21:09] not. Some of us are witty, some of us
[1:21:11] are not.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Some of us have a good personality, some
[1:21:15] of us don't.
[1:21:17] Yes.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Some of us are easy to get along with.
[1:21:21] Some of us are not easy to get along
[1:21:22] with.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Some of us just skip through life barely
[1:21:26] making mistakes. Some of us are
[1:21:28] constantly falling into mistakes.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; But I'd rather stand with you than any
[1:21:33] people on this earth. I'd rather tell
[1:21:35] you I love you. I love you. I love you
[1:21:37] and you I love you in all your flaws.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses is out. Amen. walking with
[1:21:43] these people and and and and and and
[1:21:46] Balam takes Baleo takes Balam around to
[1:21:49] the backside and starts criticizing and
[1:21:51] pointing out and he finds the backside
[1:21:53] of the camp and he says, "Look what
[1:21:54] they're doing over there. Look what
[1:21:55] they're doing over there. Look what
[1:21:56] they're doing over there. There's no way
[1:21:58] God can bless this if I point out enough
[1:22:00] flaws among the people. Surely you can
[1:22:02] give them a curse."
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; So, he pointed out all the flaws among
[1:22:07] the people. And listen, that wasn't hard
[1:22:09] to do. That's right. I
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; mean, God points them out in the Bible.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Points out all the f Listen, that's easy
[1:22:18] work.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; If you just stand with a tablet of paper
[1:22:21] in the back of the church for a couple
[1:22:23] services,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; I bet you can fill it up.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; They go to the bathroom too many times.
[1:22:29] They don't have their children under
[1:22:30] control. He fell asleep.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say amen loud enough. He says
[1:22:39] amen too loud. He's trying to get
[1:22:40] attention.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And all of that may be true.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; But after he pointed all out, Ba Balam
[1:22:51] who had a true gift but was a false
[1:22:53] vessel. When that gift went into
[1:22:54] operation, all he could say was, "How
[1:22:56] glorious are thy tents, oh Jacob. How
[1:22:59] beautiful thou are." Amen. The star
[1:23:01] shall rise out of Judah. All he could
[1:23:03] say was what God saw. Amen. And it
[1:23:05] wasn't that God was blind to their
[1:23:07] faults and their failures, but God was
[1:23:09] looking at something else. And it was
[1:23:10] the promise of his word and it was the
[1:23:12] word in them. And God was looking at
[1:23:14] something more than just the tangible
[1:23:17] flesh.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; It is so easy to p point out flaws in
[1:23:23] any group of people on the planet.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Go to any group where human beings are
[1:23:29] gathered and it doesn't take long. No
[1:23:31] sir.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; They may seem like angels on your first
[1:23:35] visit.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Right, brother Paul?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; But you visit about five or six times
[1:23:42] and you'll see a backside to Israel. Can
[1:23:45] you testify that's true, brother?
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't name any names.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. It's easy to be a critic.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. But you know, it takes a different
[1:24:01] set set of eyeballs
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; to see what's behind the veil
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; to see what is it that's the attraction.
[1:24:08] Listen, Moses wasn't a perfect person
[1:24:09] either. And it looks like Moses, he he
[1:24:12] forsook Egypt. He's a hero. Now listen,
[1:24:14] Moses has faults and failures and got
[1:24:16] upset and drew attention to himself. And
[1:24:18] Moses did all kinds of things that he
[1:24:19] could do. But there was another force
[1:24:21] inside Moses driving him to this word.
[1:24:24] Amen. Driving him to his brethren,
[1:24:26] driving him back. Amen. And he didn't
[1:24:28] want to go. and he met the pillar of
[1:24:29] fire, but there was something in him
[1:24:31] that was moving him.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And listen, we make we make mistakes and
[1:24:36] and we got all kinds of things that I
[1:24:38] there there's I wish that God would
[1:24:40] allow me to reshape myself.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; But I don't have that option.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I got to deal with it.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You've got to deal with it.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; And I've got to deal with you.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; But I'm happy to. Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; I consider it a privilege.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if this is where God wants
[1:25:00] to manifest himself in a people upon the
[1:25:02] earth, then I want to be identified them
[1:25:05] and their faults, their foils, their
[1:25:06] failures, their successes, the highs and
[1:25:08] the lows. I want to be where God is
[1:25:10] working. I want to be where there's a
[1:25:12] people feasting on the lamb. I want to
[1:25:13] be where Christ is honored, where his
[1:25:15] word is respected, where he's wanted
[1:25:17] above everything else. That's where I
[1:25:19] want to be.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. And amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Can we bear the reproach
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; of one another.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; That might just be part of the reproach
[1:25:37] of Christ.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:25:44] What is it we're feeding on, friends?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; The body word.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; The word. The body word of the Son of
[1:25:51] Man. We're feasting on it.
[1:25:55] We love it. We want it.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Others will throw it in a rubbish bin,
[1:26:00] but we want it.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Others will reject it and call it
[1:26:04] unsaavory names, but we want it.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Others will chalk it up as a bunch of
[1:26:09] strange people with strange ideas, but I
[1:26:11] want it.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; And if I have to be labeled strange
[1:26:15] person with strange ideas, then so be
[1:26:17] it. cuz this is worth more to me than a
[1:26:19] a title
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; than the respect of man than than
[1:26:23] fellowship with the world.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. We're going to be outcast
[1:26:28] eventually anyway. So,
[1:26:34] praise God.
[1:26:37] Now, that's the introduction.
[1:26:42] Preaching.
[1:26:44] But after I was meditating on all that,
[1:26:46] I started getting into this that I'm
[1:26:48] going to start sharing with you now. And
[1:26:50] this is why I I titled this the value of
[1:26:53] Christ to me to me personally.
[1:26:58] Said, I'm asking you as an individual,
[1:27:01] what do you do with the blood of Jesus
[1:27:02] Christ? What will you do with this
[1:27:05] anointed word of God that's right before
[1:27:07] us today that we know is to be is the
[1:27:10] Christ, the promise of the hour? What
[1:27:13] will you do with it? That's the
[1:27:16] question. Now it's identified. We know
[1:27:19] what it is. But what will we do with it?
[1:27:22] That's the question. And the message is
[1:27:24] what shall we do with this Jesus called
[1:27:26] Christ? That's a good question.
[1:27:29] Says, "And Christ is the word, the
[1:27:33] anointed word made manifest." That way
[1:27:36] nobody has any misunderstanding to what
[1:27:38] Christ is. Christ is the word, the
[1:27:42] anointed word made manifest.
[1:27:45] So if I'm going to bear the reproach of
[1:27:47] Christ, then I need to find the anointed
[1:27:50] word made manifest.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to feed on Christ and drink
[1:27:55] from Christ, I need to find the anointed
[1:27:58] word made manifest.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "And so is he on your hands."
[1:28:06] See, you know what I'm talking about.
[1:28:09] Not only you, but this tape, he's on
[1:28:11] your hands. What are you going to do
[1:28:13] with him? This Jesus called Christ.
[1:28:16] Christ is the anointed word. See, what
[1:28:19] are you going to do with it? It's the
[1:28:21] message of the hour.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; This message is Christ.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; It's not books. It's not recordings. All
[1:28:30] of that contains the word of the Lord.
[1:28:32] Amen. But the word of the Lord is
[1:28:34] Christ.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; It's the anointed word. Amen. being
[1:28:38] fleshed out in this hour coming into a
[1:28:40] manifestation in people. That word was
[1:28:42] brought from the mind of God, brought
[1:28:44] through the lips of a prophet to be the
[1:28:46] spoken word of God. But that spoken word
[1:28:49] of God had to go to a resting place. It
[1:28:51] had to find a place. And remember Isaiah
[1:28:54] spoke the word of God. The thought of
[1:28:55] God came into Isaiah and spoke through
[1:28:58] Isaiah's lips, "A virgin shall
[1:28:59] conceive." And brother Brandham said
[1:29:01] that word circled and circled the earth
[1:29:03] waiting to find a place to land. And
[1:29:06] finally it found a place in the virgin
[1:29:08] womb of Mary. Amen. And then that word
[1:29:11] became a manifestation inside of her and
[1:29:13] produced the son of God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; But this message is the spoken word of
[1:29:19] God. Amen. And it may be going round and
[1:29:21] round the earth for the last 50 or 60
[1:29:23] years looking for a place to land. But I
[1:29:26] want to be the place for it to land.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's Christ. Amen. It's
[1:29:31] the word for today. And it's landing in
[1:29:33] the hearts of his children. Yes,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; it's the message of the hour. And that
[1:29:39] the the the children of God are
[1:29:41] receiving that spoken word. And when
[1:29:43] they receive the spoken word, they're
[1:29:45] eating the lamb. They're feeding on
[1:29:48] Christ. They're they're eating his body
[1:29:51] word.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; The word that's been made flesh, the
[1:29:55] word that's come, amen, and been spoken.
[1:29:57] Now, they're taking and eating that
[1:29:59] word. And as they eat that word and they
[1:30:01] drink that blood, receive the life of
[1:30:03] the word, now that word comes into them
[1:30:06] and becomes their life. And when it hits
[1:30:08] their soul, amen, it begins to grow the
[1:30:10] seed gene of God that's on the inside.
[1:30:12] And it begins to reproduce that word
[1:30:15] again in human form in bodies. And
[1:30:18] that's the message of the hour.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; That's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:30:24] He's coming through a spoken word to
[1:30:26] find a resting place in a virgin womb
[1:30:28] that's been washed by the water of the
[1:30:30] word and brought back to a virgin
[1:30:32] condition so that you can feast on the
[1:30:34] lamb to receive the seed and bring forth
[1:30:37] what? The word into manifestation
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; when you ladies choose to dress like a
[1:30:43] Christian to represent Christ in female
[1:30:45] form and not dress like the world and
[1:30:47] get rid of the fashions of the world but
[1:30:49] dress as a Christian woman. That's the
[1:30:51] word in this hour made flesh. When you
[1:30:54] men take the leadership over your homes,
[1:30:56] amen, and you train up your children the
[1:30:58] way they should go and you bring your
[1:31:00] home and subject to the word, that's the
[1:31:02] word being fleshed out in this hour.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; What is that? That's Christ.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; The message.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Christ is the message.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we're feeding on it, receiving
[1:31:18] it, becoming one with it so that it can
[1:31:21] bring us into the manifestation of
[1:31:23] Christ
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And the reproach of that
[1:31:33] is greater riches to me
[1:31:36] than all the treasure of Egypt.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; To be misunderstood because of that.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:45] Listen,
[1:31:47] it doesn't mean
[1:31:50] because we are willing to bear the
[1:31:52] reproach of Christ
[1:31:54] versus anything in the world, it doesn't
[1:31:56] mean that we say it feels good or it's
[1:32:00] nice. I like that. Do that again to me.
[1:32:03] I don't think any of us as human beings
[1:32:04] feel that way. We get we get hurt. We
[1:32:08] get stepped on. Sometimes we get
[1:32:10] offended. Sometimes we we we we are so
[1:32:13] misunderstood.
[1:32:15] But don't ever forget Jesus was
[1:32:17] misunderstood
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; when he was on this earth. They didn't
[1:32:20] understand him. They didn't understand
[1:32:21] what he's talking about. They didn't
[1:32:22] understand his life. And they falsely
[1:32:24] accused him of so many things.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; And if they did that to my Lord, why
[1:32:30] can't why wouldn't I expect them to do
[1:32:32] it to me?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "If they call the master be
[1:32:36] elabove, what will they call the
[1:32:38] servants?
[1:32:41] I say, "Lord, if that's a reproach I
[1:32:44] have to bear, then I bear it."
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't bear it begrudgingly,
[1:32:51] but I count it greater riches.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Greater riches.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I'll take the disrespect for the word
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; versus respect for anything else.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Because the examples in the contrast
[1:33:10] The contrast is bearing the reproach of
[1:33:13] Christ
[1:33:14] versus the riches, the treasures of
[1:33:18] Egypt. Now, how big is that contrast,
[1:33:21] friends? I'm thinking Moses day.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; How rich was Egypt?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; What did Egypt have? Egypt had
[1:33:30] everything.
[1:33:32] But he would take the reproach of the
[1:33:35] lowest over the riches of the highest.
[1:33:40] And that's the contrast.
[1:33:43] I would rather
[1:33:45] be mocked.
[1:33:47] I would rather somebody say what you
[1:33:49] believe is heresy.
[1:33:51] I'd rather take that than somebody say,
[1:33:53] "I really respect you because you're
[1:33:55] really good at this task or that task."
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Which would you rather have? I'll take
[1:34:00] the reproach.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; God is good, friends.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram asked the question. We
[1:34:10] know what Christ is. We know what the
[1:34:12] body word of the Son of Man. We know how
[1:34:14] to eat Christ and drink Christ, the
[1:34:16] spiritual drink and the spiritual food
[1:34:18] and be partakers of it. And we know that
[1:34:20] it's the message of the hour. But now he
[1:34:22] says, "What are you going to do with it?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; What is the value of it?" That's what
[1:34:27] Moses expressed. Moses expressed the
[1:34:29] value of the word to him.
[1:34:33] The value of the word to him was more
[1:34:37] valuable than riches and prestige and
[1:34:40] power. So the question is, what is the
[1:34:43] value of Christ to me? What is it more
[1:34:47] valuable than to me?
[1:34:50] In Mark chapter 10, he says, "And when
[1:34:54] he's gone forth into the way, there came
[1:34:56] one running, kneelled to him, and asked
[1:34:58] him, good master, what shall I do that I
[1:35:00] may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said
[1:35:03] unto him, why callst thou me good? There
[1:35:05] is none good but one, that is God. Thou
[1:35:08] knowest the commandments, do not commit
[1:35:10] adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do
[1:35:13] not bear false witness, defraud not,
[1:35:15] honor thy father and mother." And he
[1:35:17] answered and said unto him, Master, all
[1:35:19] these have I observed from my youth.
[1:35:22] When Jesus beholding him, loved him, and
[1:35:24] said unto him, One thing thou lackest.
[1:35:28] Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast,
[1:35:30] and give to the poor, and thou shalt
[1:35:32] have treasure in heaven, and come, take
[1:35:35] up the cross, and follow me." And he was
[1:35:38] sad at the saying, and went away
[1:35:40] grieved, for he had great possessions.
[1:35:44] We know this story is the story of the
[1:35:46] rich young ruler. And brother Brandham
[1:35:47] preaches it several places, but one is
[1:35:49] leadership. And he contrasts Moses' life
[1:35:52] with the life of this rich young ruler.
[1:35:54] And this young man comes to him uh and
[1:35:59] and he says, "I've done all the deeds
[1:36:01] and I've I've done everything the
[1:36:03] religion requires and my priest has said
[1:36:05] and what Moses I've done all of that."
[1:36:08] But it says Jesus beholding him loved
[1:36:12] him.
[1:36:12] Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; So what Jesus is getting ready to tell
[1:36:15] him is love.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But the rich young ruler didn't receive
[1:36:20] it as love.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus beholding him loved him and said,
[1:36:24] "One thing thou lackest, sell whatsoever
[1:36:27] thou hast and give to the poor, and thou
[1:36:29] shalt have treasure in heaven."
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Take up thy cross and
[1:36:35] follow me."
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; That is another contrast.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] from a rich young ruler to a criminal
[1:36:45] crucified on a cross
[1:36:48] to sacrificing your life, from living
[1:36:50] your life to sacrificing your life, from
[1:36:52] the top to the bottom. And Jesus is
[1:36:55] asking this man to make that transition
[1:36:59] and make that choice from the top to the
[1:37:01] bottom.
[1:37:03] That's what he's asking him. Sell all
[1:37:05] that thou has and give to the poor and
[1:37:08] thou shalt have treasure in heaven.
[1:37:11] This man, no matter what he said, he
[1:37:14] called Jesus good and master, but no
[1:37:17] matter what he says to Jesus, he shows
[1:37:20] how much he values the word.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; His actions declare the value he has on
[1:37:27] Jesus Christ, the word made flesh.
[1:37:29] Because when Jesus says this, you ask me
[1:37:31] what to do, this is what you need to do.
[1:37:33] Sell all that you have, give to the
[1:37:35] poor, and you'll have treasure in
[1:37:36] heaven. Listen, if this man loved God,
[1:37:39] loved the word, loved heaven, he would
[1:37:40] sell everything for heaven
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; because heaven's more valuable than
[1:37:44] anything on the earth. But he valued the
[1:37:46] earth more than heaven.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; And then on top of all of that, take up
[1:37:55] your cross, bear a reproach
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and follow me.
[1:38:01] And he was sad at the saying and went
[1:38:05] away grieved because he had great
[1:38:08] possessions.
[1:38:12] This is a sad story.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz the man has come to God in flesh.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; He's come to the fresh mana to the word
[1:38:24] for his day through the through the rock
[1:38:26] where water can flow out. He's come to
[1:38:28] this point
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; and he says, "What must I do to inherit
[1:38:32] eternal life?" And Jesus tells him
[1:38:35] exactly what he must do. He has the
[1:38:38] ticket. He has the answer. There's no
[1:38:40] question mark. If he does what God tells
[1:38:42] him to do, he will have the results
[1:38:44] Jesus promised him. Amen. And so this
[1:38:46] man, he left sad. Oh my goodness. How
[1:38:49] could he leave sad? I would leave so
[1:38:52] happy. Amen. I now know what I got to
[1:38:54] do. And all I got to do is give up the
[1:38:56] world and have him. All I got to do is
[1:38:58] give up my life and sacrifice myself.
[1:39:00] And if I'll do that, I can have him and
[1:39:03] I can have eternal life and I can be
[1:39:04] where he is. Why was he sad? He should
[1:39:07] have been running away, clicking his
[1:39:08] heels, calling an auctioneer on the way.
[1:39:10] Will you come and help me sell
[1:39:12] everything I've got? Call the Salvation
[1:39:14] Army and say, "I need you to help me
[1:39:16] distribute these goods because I found
[1:39:17] the way to have what my heart's
[1:39:19] craving." Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; He went away sad because he gave lip
[1:39:24] service to loving God, lip service to
[1:39:26] wanting heaven. But what he really
[1:39:28] wanted more, he valued more his fleshly
[1:39:31] carnal life than eternal life.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; God help me never to find myself in this
[1:39:37] place where I value something of this
[1:39:39] world more than I value eternal life,
[1:39:41] more than I value Christ himself.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Because remember, eternal life is not a
[1:39:47] reward.
[1:39:48] Eternal life is a person.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; It's the person of God himself because
[1:39:53] only God has eternal life. Zoe life.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; God be praised. Be praised. Be praised.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord is all I can say.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; We're going to find as we carry on.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. This man, though he's a rich young
[1:40:14] ruler, though he was a good boy all of
[1:40:16] his life, though he looked good in the
[1:40:18] community and had a good reputation and
[1:40:20] good good, he had a good reputation at
[1:40:22] church and he had a good reputation in
[1:40:23] business. He had a good reputation
[1:40:25] everywhere.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't willing to bear the
[1:40:29] reproach of poverty in the cross
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; for Christ.
[1:40:36] To me, it shows there was nothing inside
[1:40:38] to drive him
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; because he the decision he made was the
[1:40:43] most logical decision to a carnal mind
[1:40:45] that doesn't have eyes to see eternal.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; In Philippians 3, Paul says, "But what
[1:40:56] things were gained to me? Those I
[1:40:58] counted lost for Christ. Yay doubtless
[1:41:01] and I count all things but loss for the
[1:41:02] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[1:41:04] Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the
[1:41:06] loss of all things and do count them but
[1:41:09] dung that I may win Christ. Here's
[1:41:11] another rich young ruler. Amen. But when
[1:41:14] he come in contact with the pillar of
[1:41:15] fire and the pillar of fire told him
[1:41:17] what he must do. He did it exactly as he
[1:41:20] said because he was willing to count
[1:41:22] everything else that he lost as dung
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; that he might win Christ.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. to him. It all of a sudden
[1:41:31] everything that was important to Saul,
[1:41:34] his prestige, his reputation, his
[1:41:37] education under Galio, his letter from
[1:41:39] the high priest, whatever his ambition
[1:41:41] was in the church and amongst the Jews
[1:41:43] for leadership, whatever it was that he
[1:41:46] had, whatever was important to him, when
[1:41:48] he met the living word, the present
[1:41:50] tense Jesus Christ, Amen, displaying
[1:41:53] himself to him, he was willing to give
[1:41:54] up all of this for this because there
[1:41:56] was something down inside of him. He was
[1:41:59] a predestinated seed of God. It wasn't
[1:42:01] logic. It wasn't mental powers. It
[1:42:03] wasn't sitting down on a calculator and
[1:42:05] saying, "Well, if I do this and I'll
[1:42:07] have this and this is worth more than
[1:42:09] that." He wasn't calculating, friends.
[1:42:11] There was something inside of him that
[1:42:13] said, "That's what I want. That's what I
[1:42:15] want. That's what I want."
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And it drove him all of his life
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; to take the way with the Lord's despised
[1:42:24] view. It drove him all of his life to
[1:42:26] rejection and heartache and pain and a
[1:42:29] cross every day of his life. He said, "I
[1:42:31] die daily."
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; What was driving him? It wasn't a man's
[1:42:36] mental powers. It was something of God
[1:42:38] on the inside that when he came in
[1:42:40] contact with the living word, he began
[1:42:42] to feed from that spiritual rock. Drink
[1:42:44] from the rock. Feed from the word. And
[1:42:46] it transformed his life. And all he
[1:42:48] wanted was that.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; To win Christ. And everything became the
[1:42:54] equivalent of dung
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; manure,
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; waste.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; What an example we have, friends.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Colossians 3 says, "If you then be risen
[1:43:10] with Christ, seek those things which are
[1:43:12] above, where Christ siteth on the right
[1:43:15] hand of God. Set your affections on
[1:43:17] things above, not on things on the
[1:43:19] earth. For ye are dead and your life is
[1:43:21] hid with Christ in God. When Christ who
[1:43:23] is our life shall appear, then shall ye
[1:43:25] also appear with him in glory. That's
[1:43:28] what I want. Set my affections on things
[1:43:31] above, not on the Listen. Listen. I'm
[1:43:34] not preaching this to talk you into
[1:43:36] something.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you to behave
[1:43:40] better.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you to not focus
[1:43:43] so much time on work before. Listen,
[1:43:45] that's a drive that comes from inside.
[1:43:47] That's something that God placed there
[1:43:49] before the foundation of the world. I'm
[1:43:50] only reminding you of who you are and
[1:43:52] telling you what God's done and showing
[1:43:54] you what's the most important things in
[1:43:56] life to snap us back to our real
[1:43:58] understanding.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not preaching a message for
[1:44:02] somebody to conform to. It's impossible
[1:44:04] for you to conform, amen, to the
[1:44:06] preaching. Amen. You have to be
[1:44:07] transformed by the preaching. It has to
[1:44:09] be something inside that comes to life.
[1:44:11] I'm not telling you this to shape you
[1:44:13] up. Amen. And make you something that
[1:44:15] you're not. I'm here to bring to life
[1:44:16] what's on the inside so that something
[1:44:18] inside of you begins to bubble up and
[1:44:20] say that's exactly what I want. That's
[1:44:22] exactly what I want.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I want Christ and I want everything else
[1:44:26] to become dung to me.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. To me, that's what this
[1:44:33] message did to me. When I heard this
[1:44:35] message, it made everything else
[1:44:38] secondary. It made everything else uh
[1:44:40] unimportant to me. The only thing that
[1:44:42] mattered now was this message. I had
[1:44:45] found God. I found the truth. I knew
[1:44:47] what was real. I knew what was right.
[1:44:49] And I come in contact with the living
[1:44:51] Jesus Christ. And nothing else mattered.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; God, help me stay in that first love.
[1:44:57] That's my prayer. Let me stay right
[1:44:59] there where I was willing to give up
[1:45:01] anything, be called anything, talk to
[1:45:03] anybody about the word, no matter what
[1:45:05] the reaction was.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; God, forgive us for becoming lazy. God,
[1:45:11] forgive us for becoming comfortable.
[1:45:13] God, help us to stay in that place.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. That's my prayer for me.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; That's why this message is what is the
[1:45:23] value of Christ to me,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; to me personally.
[1:45:28] In Philippians 3 says, not as though I
[1:45:31] had already attained,
[1:45:33] either were already perfect, but I
[1:45:35] follow after if that I may apprehend
[1:45:38] that for which also I am apprehended of
[1:45:40] Christ. Brethren, I counten on myself to
[1:45:43] have apprehended, but this one thing I
[1:45:45] do, forgetting those things which are
[1:45:47] behind, I reach forth into those things
[1:45:49] which are before. I press toward the
[1:45:51] mark for the prize of the high calling
[1:45:54] of God in Christ Jesus. Listen, Paul
[1:45:57] never lost his first love and his first
[1:45:59] desire. Here he is all the way in the
[1:46:01] book of Philippians and he's still
[1:46:02] saying, "Listen, everything that's
[1:46:04] before I count it loss. I'm pushing it
[1:46:06] to the back, but I'm striving for
[1:46:08] Christ."
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Let us therefore, as many as be perfect,
[1:46:12] be thus minded.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; If in anything you be otherwise minded,
[1:46:18] God shall reveal even this to you.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Do you see it, friends?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. It doesn't mean that we get
[1:46:27] this perfect.
[1:46:30] If in anything you be otherwise minded,
[1:46:33] God shall reveal even this to you.
[1:46:36] Oh, God comes along and has a way of
[1:46:38] bringing us back to attention, bringing
[1:46:40] us back to our first love, waking us
[1:46:42] back to our real desires.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; It's not that we don't get distracted
[1:46:46] from time to time and we get distracted.
[1:46:48] Amen. Things happen to us. But I'm so
[1:46:50] thankful that Paul said, "Amen. As those
[1:46:52] that are perfect, mature, let's be thus
[1:46:54] minded." And if in any if in anything,
[1:46:57] any little detail, any area of life, you
[1:46:59] be otherwise minded, God shall reveal
[1:47:01] even this to you.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nevertheless, where until we have
[1:47:06] already attained, let us walk by the
[1:47:08] same rule. Let us mine the same thing.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; So in any area you've already attained,
[1:47:14] you just keep pressing on.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. No sitting down, no resting, no
[1:47:20] giving up.
[1:47:21] Now, I want to take us back to the book
[1:47:23] of Deuteronomy. I've got a slide here
[1:47:25] I'm going to show you. And there's
[1:47:27] something that Moses said that was so
[1:47:29] astounding to me.
[1:47:31] Moses keeps telling the children of
[1:47:33] Israel over and over. He says, "Love the
[1:47:36] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[1:47:37] all thy soul." And he tells them two,
[1:47:39] three, four times that you are to love,
[1:47:42] keep his commandments and love him. Love
[1:47:44] him and keep his commandments. Love him
[1:47:45] with all your heart and with all your
[1:47:46] soul.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And he's commanding them to love the
[1:47:49] Lord.
[1:47:51] But listen to what he says in this
[1:47:52] commandment
[1:47:54] in Deuteronomy 30. And the Lord thy God
[1:47:57] will bring thee into a land which thy
[1:47:58] fathers possessed. And thou shalt
[1:48:01] possess it, and he will do thee good,
[1:48:03] and multiply thee above thy fathers. And
[1:48:05] the Lord thy God will circumcise thine
[1:48:08] heart
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; and the heart of thy seed to love the
[1:48:12] Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
[1:48:15] all thy soul, that thou mayest livest.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; He's commanded them, love God with all
[1:48:19] your heart. Love God with all your soul.
[1:48:21] Love God and keep his commandments. But
[1:48:23] he gave them a promise that when you
[1:48:25] come into this land, the Lord, the Lord
[1:48:27] thy God will circumcise your heart and
[1:48:30] the heart of your seed to love the Lord
[1:48:33] with all thine heart, with all thy soul.
[1:48:35] Hey, listen. If you're struggling with
[1:48:36] the world, you're struggling with the
[1:48:38] things of the world. Come into the land.
[1:48:40] The land is the word. Amen. That's been
[1:48:42] open to us. Come into your possession.
[1:48:44] come into the land and raise your hands
[1:48:46] to God and say, "Circumcise my heart and
[1:48:48] the heart of my sin that I might love
[1:48:50] you with all my heart and with all my
[1:48:54] soul."
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; This isn't something we do by ourselves.
[1:48:57] This isn't something we do by our own
[1:48:59] strength. But we're dependent on God to
[1:49:01] come with the power of circumcision.
[1:49:03] Amen. Which is the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:05] Ghost, which will cut away the flesh of
[1:49:07] our lives and bring us into new life.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:11] so that we can that so that we have the
[1:49:14] ability, the capability to love him with
[1:49:17] all of our heart.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; With all of our soul.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; I say, God, circumcise my heart.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Circumcise it aresh today. Circumcise it
[1:49:26] every morning when I rise, Lord, because
[1:49:28] I need that power. Amen. Of circumcision
[1:49:31] to bring out of me that love
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:49:36] take away.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Matthew 22 says, "Master,
[1:49:41] which is the greatest commandment in the
[1:49:43] law?"
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said unto him, "Thou shalt love
[1:49:46] the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
[1:49:48] with all thy soul, with all thy mind.
[1:49:51] This is the first and great
[1:49:53] commandment."
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; So what is the greatest commandment?
[1:49:58] To love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:50:01] heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
[1:50:03] mind.
[1:50:06] He He told you what the greatest
[1:50:08] commandment was.
[1:50:10] The problem is in your flesh, you can't
[1:50:12] keep that commandment.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; But you need a circumcision of the
[1:50:18] heart.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord will circumcise when we
[1:50:22] come into the land, it will circumcise
[1:50:23] our heart,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; we'll be able to love him with all of
[1:50:26] our heart
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; and with all of our soul.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; That's what I want, friends. I want that
[1:50:31] fresh circumcision every day of my life.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, the world is grabbing at you.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Well, it's grabbing at me. Maybe it's
[1:50:42] not grabbing at you. But brother Bam
[1:50:44] said we have a sticky cocker burn nature
[1:50:46] that comes from hybridization.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And that spirit that's of the world and
[1:50:51] a sticky cocka burn nature. Amen. It
[1:50:53] gets sticky. Things want to stick to it.
[1:50:55] It wants to cling to things of the world
[1:50:57] and things of the world want to cling to
[1:50:58] it. And he says you'll have a sticky
[1:51:00] cocker nature that will bother you all
[1:51:02] of your life.
[1:51:04] And so we have to be aware of that. But
[1:51:06] oh, I thankful that there's a genuine
[1:51:09] wheat seed down on the inside and
[1:51:11] there's a circumcision of the heart.
[1:51:13] Amen. That can shed off the things that
[1:51:14] are sticking to me. Amen. And something
[1:51:16] else sticks to me. May God bring that to
[1:51:18] my attention. Amen. So that I'm not
[1:51:20] otherwise minded. So that God will
[1:51:22] reveal even this to me. So that I can
[1:51:24] shake off something else that's trying
[1:51:25] to stick to me. So that everything else
[1:51:27] becomes dung and he becomes everything
[1:51:29] to me.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; That I might win Christ.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to look at this scripture
[1:51:36] here as well. Oh my goodness, this is
[1:51:39] one of my favorites.
[1:51:41] 2 Samuel 24:24
[1:51:45] says, "And the king said unto Aaron,
[1:51:50] black screen,
[1:51:53] I want to set up this story. This is
[1:51:54] where David numbers the people and
[1:51:56] brings a curse upon the people. And the
[1:51:59] angel of the Lord's going out with a
[1:52:00] pestilence, killing 70,000 of the
[1:52:03] Israelites. And and finally, he stops
[1:52:05] him over Israel. And David begins to
[1:52:07] repent. And he throws himself in the
[1:52:09] breach. And he says, "Lord, let this be
[1:52:11] upon me and upon my house, but not upon
[1:52:13] these sheep. What have they done wrong?"
[1:52:15] And God sends Gad the prophet to him and
[1:52:17] says, "Now go over to the stretching
[1:52:19] floor where the angel stopped and and
[1:52:22] offer unto God a sacrifice there and
[1:52:25] it'll appease God." So he comes to this
[1:52:28] man and this man, I can't pronounce his
[1:52:31] name, Aronah or whatever.
[1:52:34] He comes to him and he says, "I've come
[1:52:38] to offer sacrifice to the Lord. I'm here
[1:52:40] to buy of you the threshing floor and
[1:52:42] all of that." And Areron says, "No, my
[1:52:45] lord, take it of me. I give it to you as
[1:52:47] a gift. Take it and offer it." And this
[1:52:49] is what David says. David says, "Nay,
[1:52:52] but I will surely buy it of thee at a
[1:52:54] price.
[1:52:56] Neither will I offer burnt offerings
[1:52:58] unto the Lord my God of that which doth
[1:53:00] cost me nothing."
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; So David bought the threshing floor for
[1:53:07] an auction for 50 shekels of silver.
[1:53:10] Listen, this was the problem with the
[1:53:12] rich young ruler.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He He wanted to offer to God what he
[1:53:17] already had. He already had the He had a
[1:53:19] good temperament. He had a good
[1:53:21] understanding. He knew the law. He was
[1:53:22] good in church. He was already able to
[1:53:25] keep the commandments. Yes, sir.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And he wanted to offer to God what he
[1:53:29] was already able to pay. That's
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; But didn't cost him everything.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted worship that was easy.
[1:53:41] Service that was easy. Eternal life that
[1:53:43] was easy.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; But when God says, "No, lose your life.
[1:53:48] Give up everything. Take up your cross.
[1:53:50] Take the way of the despised view. Come
[1:53:52] by the way of reproach." He said, "No, I
[1:53:54] don't want that." And he went away sad
[1:53:56] because he had great possessions. Amen.
[1:53:58] But here here comes Moses along and
[1:54:00] Moses has everything and more that this
[1:54:03] rich young ruler ever had. But he's
[1:54:05] willing to give it all up that he might
[1:54:07] bear. He might he might esteem the
[1:54:09] reproach of Christ's greater riches.
[1:54:10] Praise God.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I love that. That's a child of God.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; That's Listen, that's not a great man.
[1:54:20] That's not a superhuman being. That's a
[1:54:21] child of God.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; That's as simple as an offspring of God.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And here comes David. Now, David has
[1:54:30] this plague breaking out and God comes
[1:54:32] to him. The seer says, "Listen, what you
[1:54:34] need to do is just offer an offering to
[1:54:36] God. And if you if you go and build an
[1:54:38] altar and offer an offering, God will
[1:54:39] stay his hand. And so he goes to this
[1:54:42] man who owns the threshing floor. And
[1:54:43] listen, this is uh what a trap.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; What a trap in life.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; The trap in life is all you have to do
[1:54:54] is this.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Just take what I hand you. It's easy.
[1:54:59] Just take this and offer that to the
[1:55:02] Lord.
[1:55:03] That was a trap for David. It didn't
[1:55:06] look like a trap. It looked like the
[1:55:07] generosity of this man.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; It looked like piety. But David said,
[1:55:12] "God forbid that I would ever offer a
[1:55:14] sacrifice to God that cost me nothing.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me be let that be the way that I
[1:55:21] serve God." Amen. I don't want to give
[1:55:22] him what cost me nothing, but let me
[1:55:24] give him my whole life. Let give him
[1:55:26] something that cost me. Yeah.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Do you know that we offer to God the
[1:55:30] sacrifices of praise from these lips?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But you know there's days in your life
[1:55:35] that you're having the worst day of your
[1:55:37] life and everything goes wrong and
[1:55:38] you're depressed and you're in the dumps
[1:55:40] and you feel miserable and you want to
[1:55:42] die and go on to the sixth dimension.
[1:55:44] Has anybody lived in a day like that
[1:55:45] where you wish God just let me leave the
[1:55:47] earth today?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. When you come to church and
[1:55:50] the music's good and the song is good
[1:55:52] and everybody's clapping their hands and
[1:55:53] you sing, that's one thing. But when you
[1:55:55] get to the lowest of the lowest of the
[1:55:57] lowest that you've ever felt and you
[1:55:59] say, "Hey, God is good
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; and worthy to be praised. Your name is
[1:56:05] high above all names." That's a
[1:56:07] sacrifice of praise, friends, because
[1:56:09] you praised him not because you felt
[1:56:10] like praising him. You didn't praise him
[1:56:12] because everything was going right. You
[1:56:14] didn't praise him because he gave you
[1:56:15] good gifts. You praised him because he
[1:56:16] was worthy to be praised. And that's a
[1:56:18] sacrifice of praise.
[1:56:21] I don't want to give God something that
[1:56:23] cost me nothing.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Malachi together. Turn with
[1:56:30] me to Malachi.
[1:56:43] Malachi chapter 1.
[1:56:48] My goodness.
[1:56:53] Malachi chapter 1 verse 6
[1:57:00] says, "A son honorth his father and a
[1:57:03] servant his master? If then I be a
[1:57:06] father, where is my honor? And if I be a
[1:57:09] master, where is my fear? Sayeth the
[1:57:11] Lord of hosts unto you, oh priests that
[1:57:13] despise my name." And you say, "Wherein
[1:57:16] have we despised thy name?" You offer
[1:57:18] polluted bread upon my altar, and you
[1:57:22] say, "Wherein have we polluted thee?" In
[1:57:24] that ye say, the table of the Lord is
[1:57:27] contemptable.
[1:57:29] And if you offer the blind for
[1:57:31] sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you
[1:57:34] offer the lame and the sick, is it not
[1:57:36] evil? Offer it now unto thy governor,
[1:57:38] will he be pleased with thee, or accept
[1:57:41] thy person, sayeth the Lord of hosts?
[1:57:43] Jesus is saying to them, "Listen, you
[1:57:46] give your father's honor. You give fear
[1:57:49] to your masters, but you give to me
[1:57:51] leftovers.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; You give to me bread that is corrupt,
[1:57:57] bread that is stale, bread that is going
[1:57:59] old, and you offer it to me on my
[1:58:01] tables."
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Here, you offer the blind for
[1:58:05] sacrifice." What was their offerings in
[1:58:07] that day? Their offerings were a lamb, a
[1:58:09] goat, a turtle dove, an oxen.
[1:58:13] And instead of bringing God the very
[1:58:15] best animal that they could produce,
[1:58:18] they started taking what they wanted to
[1:58:19] call out of their herds, what wasn't
[1:58:21] very good anymore. Amen. This one's
[1:58:23] blind.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Let's go sacrifice that to the Lord.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Because in that day, it was an
[1:58:29] agricultural society. Everything was
[1:58:31] based off the strength, the genetic
[1:58:33] strength of your herd. And you always
[1:58:35] wanted good genetics to make good
[1:58:36] genetics to have strong healthy animals.
[1:58:38] That's where wealth came from in that
[1:58:40] day. Amen. And all of a sudden he says,
[1:58:42] "You offer to me the blind."
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Then he says this,
[1:58:47] "You offer the lame and the sick."
[1:58:51] He said, "Go to your governor.
[1:58:55] Go to the magistrate in the city. go to
[1:58:57] the governor and you offer him a sick
[1:59:00] lamb or a lame lamb or a blind lamb and
[1:59:02] see if he's pleased with you.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; What were they doing? They lost heart
[1:59:09] for God. They were going through the
[1:59:11] ritual by commandment and they were
[1:59:13] taking the least of what they had. What
[1:59:15] cost them the least is what they were
[1:59:17] giving to God. What was worthless in
[1:59:19] their heart and what was no good and
[1:59:21] liable to die, they went ahead and
[1:59:22] offered that because we have to give
[1:59:24] something to God. So I'll give them
[1:59:26] what?
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; This was the condition they were in when
[1:59:32] Malachi was speaking to them.
[1:59:35] He said, "Now verse 9, and now I pray
[1:59:38] you, beseech God that he will be
[1:59:39] gracious unto us. This hath been by your
[1:59:42] means will will he regard your person,
[1:59:46] sayeth the Lord of hosts. Who is there
[1:59:48] even among you that would shut the door
[1:59:50] for not? Neither do you kindle fire on
[1:59:52] my altar for not. I have no pleasure in
[1:59:54] you, sayeth the Lord of hosts, neither
[1:59:56] will I accept an offering at your hand.
[1:59:58] For from the rising of the sun, even to
[2:00:00] the going down of the same, my name
[2:00:02] shall be great among the Gentiles, and
[2:00:05] in every place incense shall be offered
[2:00:07] unto my name, and a pure offering. For
[2:00:09] my name shall be great among the
[2:00:10] heathens, sayeth the Lord of hosts. But
[2:00:13] ye have profained it, and that you say,
[2:00:16] The table of the Lord is polluted, and
[2:00:18] the fruit thereof, even as meat, is
[2:00:20] contemptable.
[2:00:21] You said also, "Behold, what a weariness
[2:00:25] is it?"
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; What was wearing them? Having to serve
[2:00:30] the Lord, having to go to the temple,
[2:00:32] having to take a sacrifice.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; It became weariesome.
[2:00:37] You have snuffed at it, sayeth the Lord
[2:00:39] of Hosts. You brought that which was
[2:00:41] torn and the lame and the sick. Thus you
[2:00:44] brought an offering. Shall I accept this
[2:00:46] of your hand? Sayeth the Lord. But
[2:00:48] cursed be the deceiver which hath in his
[2:00:51] flock a male and voweth and sacrifice
[2:00:53] unto the Lord a corrupt thing. For I am
[2:00:55] a great king, sayaeth the Lord of hosts,
[2:00:57] and my name is dreadful among the
[2:00:59] heathen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; What a deceiver. You make a vow and you
[2:01:04] pledge your vow. You go and bring an
[2:01:06] animal and you've got a worthy male
[2:01:08] sitting there. Amen. You've got a nice
[2:01:10] handsome animal. You've got something
[2:01:12] that can bring bring forth godly pro or
[2:01:14] good progeny. It's strong. It's male.
[2:01:16] It's in its strength. And you won't take
[2:01:18] that. But you'll bring a corruptible
[2:01:20] thing. You'll bring something that's
[2:01:21] sick and lame. What is this? This is a
[2:01:23] religious work that cost them nothing.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Expecting to get something back from
[2:01:30] God.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And David had enough wits to say, "How
[2:01:35] dare I make a sacrifice that cost me
[2:01:38] nothing?" Right.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; The whole way. You know, God in his
[2:01:42] great mercy, he set up a tabernacle.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do that.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; He did it because of love. He wanted to
[2:01:49] dwell in their midst. And he made a way
[2:01:51] for them to have forgiveness of their
[2:01:53] sins even before Christ came.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; And that forgiveness of sins would come
[2:01:58] by bringing a sacrifice to atone for
[2:02:00] their sins by bringing a lamb or a goat
[2:02:02] or a turtle dove. Amen. bringing
[2:02:04] something that would becomes their
[2:02:05] substitute and they can make sacrifices
[2:02:08] and peace offerings and transgressions
[2:02:10] offerings and offerings for iniquity and
[2:02:12] offerings on feast day. And it was God's
[2:02:14] grace and God set up the three main
[2:02:16] feasts that they all had to gather
[2:02:18] around Jerusalem for. And those feast
[2:02:20] days were a time for them to feast with
[2:02:22] God.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't God's feast. God listen, they
[2:02:27] would bring their sacrifice on those
[2:02:28] feast days. They would give their
[2:02:30] sacrifice. Part of it would be burnt on
[2:02:32] the altar. Part of it would go to the
[2:02:33] priests and part of it they would take
[2:02:35] back to their camp and they would all
[2:02:37] sit around Jerusalem and they would all
[2:02:39] feast on the sacrifice and it was
[2:02:41] symbolic that they were feasting with
[2:02:43] God himself in their midst and he
[2:02:45] gathered them to a feast day so that he
[2:02:47] can join them in their feast.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; What a blessing.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; No other nation had this. Nobody had
[2:02:57] this opportunity but to them it became
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; weariesome.
[2:03:03] We got to go back to the feast of
[2:03:05] Passover.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; We got to do it every year.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; We got to find another lamb. What lamb
[2:03:12] should we take? Dad, that one over
[2:03:14] there, it's had a limp for a while and
[2:03:16] it's probably not going to get any
[2:03:17] better.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; I was going to put it down anyways.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's what they started offering him.
[2:03:24] And the feast became a weariness and
[2:03:26] they become tired of serving the Lord.
[2:03:28] And this was the grace of God in their
[2:03:30] lives. and they they didn't value the
[2:03:32] thing that God had gave them.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; God forbid we treat the message this
[2:03:38] way. This is the greatest thing that God
[2:03:40] could have given us. Amen. The
[2:03:42] opportunity. Amen. The opportunity to
[2:03:44] hear the pure word of God. Amen. And
[2:03:46] what do we give it? Amen. Uh do we
[2:03:49] worship God with no sacrifice? Do we
[2:03:51] give it five minutes a day, 10 minutes a
[2:03:53] day, Sunday, Wednesday, when we're not
[2:03:55] tired?
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Do we come to hear the live preaching of
[2:04:00] the word? the preaching of the message.
[2:04:01] Has it become weariness?
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Has Wednesday become wearing to you?
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Has Sunday become exhausting?
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Has daily devotions and prayer time in
[2:04:14] the morning become we weariesome?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; God help me.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm standing in the need of
[2:04:24] prayer, friends. I want to go back to my
[2:04:26] first love where nothing on this earth
[2:04:28] matters. If I lose friends, if I lose
[2:04:30] jobs, if I lose reputation, this is the
[2:04:32] most precious thing that God has ever
[2:04:34] given to me. And everything else is done
[2:04:36] compared to this.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God tell God tells us, "Don't
[2:04:44] forsake the assembling together of
[2:04:46] yourselves."
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know what a privilege it is just
[2:04:49] to keep his word?
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; But for some, it's become wear.
[2:04:56] Yes.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; God gave us three sacraments.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Only three.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, look at what they
[2:05:05] had.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Offerings of this and offerings of that
[2:05:08] and feast days of this. Three
[2:05:10] sacraments.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Water baptism in Jesus name. Communion
[2:05:14] and feet washing.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; He's only asked us to do three things.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; To keep three ordinances.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know what a privilege it is to
[2:05:25] keep those? That's right.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Has it become weariness? Has it become
[2:05:31] too hard to come together once a month
[2:05:33] and take communion,
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; feet washing?
[2:05:37] I say, "God, help us.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Help us. I'm not going to offer to him
[2:05:42] what does cost me nothing.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I'm tired. I'm coming
[2:05:46] anyways.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if I feel out of sorts.
[2:05:49] I'm coming anyways." Amen. What if I got
[2:05:51] something in my life, amen, that's
[2:05:52] keeping me from communion? then let's
[2:05:54] deal with it and not let it keep us
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; from one of the things that God told us
[2:05:59] to do.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Listen, has serving the Lord in this
[2:06:04] message become weariness?
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; No way, friends. Let's not let it become
[2:06:09] weariness. Amen. If we're any other
[2:06:11] minded, may God bring this revelation to
[2:06:13] our hearts anyways. But there's nothing
[2:06:15] more precious than serving God. There's
[2:06:18] nothing more wonderful than knowing what
[2:06:20] he wants us to do and doing it.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it cost me. Let's do it.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; There's been people who have taken jobs.
[2:06:30] Amen. Knowing that's going to take them
[2:06:32] out of church or move them where there's
[2:06:34] no church. They'll do that because the
[2:06:36] job has become more important than
[2:06:38] keeping the commandment.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; And and I hear it all the time. People
[2:06:43] tell me, "Well, I don't have to go to
[2:06:45] church to be saved." No, you don't have
[2:06:47] to go to church to be saved. God saves
[2:06:48] you by faith and faith alone. Nothing
[2:06:50] else, no works.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; But if he says, "Forsake not the
[2:06:55] assembling together yourselves," what
[2:06:57] does your heart want to do? Where is the
[2:06:59] seed driving you?
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] To the word. To the word. To the word.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; ABC's one, two, threes, algebra,
[2:07:14] calculus, all of it. I want to live and
[2:07:16] I don't want any of it to become
[2:07:17] weariness to me.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Listen, I don't want to get
[2:07:23] tired of dealing with you
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; and I don't want you to get tired of
[2:07:28] dealing with me
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; because God put us together for iron to
[2:07:32] sharpen iron. Amen. And let's just love
[2:07:34] one another more.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to get weary and
[2:07:38] being part of a body. Weary and being in
[2:07:41] fellowship, weary and having to repent,
[2:07:43] and weary and having to forgive.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; How are you going to have a family? How
[2:07:48] are you going to have a marriage? Right.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; You can't get weary in repentance and
[2:07:52] weary in forgiveness and wearing and
[2:07:54] dealing with one another.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; I don't want to offer to God something
[2:07:59] that cost me nothing.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the rich young ruler
[2:08:04] and looking for the easy way.
[2:08:08] But oh God, help me to give whatever of
[2:08:11] myself I can give.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; For you.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be like David.
[2:08:18] You may say, "Oh, well, all you have to
[2:08:20] do is this, brother. Just believe this
[2:08:22] and just do this and do." I don't want
[2:08:25] all I have to do. I don't want Aaron to
[2:08:29] hand me everything on a platter and just
[2:08:31] do this and you've got it.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be like David. I don't want
[2:08:36] to serve God with something that cost me
[2:08:39] nothing.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; I want to give my life to this gospel.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And listen, don't think I'm I'm talking
[2:08:46] about creating trouble. Don't go create
[2:08:48] trouble.
[2:08:49] That doesn't make any sense.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; But it comes. There's difficulties.
[2:08:54] There's weariness. There's depression.
[2:08:57] There's setbacks.
[2:08:59] There's times that you get floored.
[2:09:00] There's times you get disappointed.
[2:09:02] There's times you get hurt.
[2:09:05] But I want to serve God anyhow.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; I want to keep his word anyways.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I want to show him not with a
[2:09:14] lame sacrifice, but I want to take the
[2:09:16] best I got out of my flock and give it
[2:09:19] to him.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Not if I have spare time, if I'm not
[2:09:24] busy, if I'm not already tied up, if I
[2:09:26] haven't made other plans.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; No, I want to give him the best that I
[2:09:32] got
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; because I'm honored that he would even
[2:09:35] tell me what he wants and give me the
[2:09:36] opportunity to do it.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; I'm honored that he gave me three
[2:09:40] sacraments. Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; At least there's something I can do to
[2:09:43] show you I love you.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; I'm honored that he told me not to
[2:09:47] forsake the assembling together. I'm
[2:09:49] honored that I have something I can do
[2:09:50] to show that I love him and reverence
[2:09:52] him.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; I'm just privileged. I'm honored to do
[2:09:56] something for my Lord.
[2:09:59] Brother Ram tells this story.
[2:10:02] He says,
[2:10:05] "Oh man,
[2:10:07] in the message forsaking all, he says, I
[2:10:10] read a little article in the paper the
[2:10:11] other day where an old man, he was both
[2:10:14] deaf, dumb, and blind, and he went to
[2:10:16] Sunday school every Sunday."
[2:10:19] And they asked him in Braille, said,
[2:10:20] "Why do you go to church? You can't hear
[2:10:22] what the preacher said. You can't hear
[2:10:24] none of the songs. Why do you go to
[2:10:26] church?" He said, "I just want to let
[2:10:28] everybody know what side I'm on. Yeah.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; I just want to let the devil and
[2:10:32] everybody else know that he what side
[2:10:35] he's on. I think that's good. Yes, sir.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, this man didn't go to church to
[2:10:41] get something out of church.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz he didn't get anything out of it.
[2:10:47] He went to prove his love for God and
[2:10:49] prove to devil he loves God.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; New side he's on.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; You know, we go through slumps and I've
[2:10:55] heard it so many times. I'm not going
[2:10:56] there cuz I'm not getting fed.
[2:11:00] So you quit following the word because
[2:11:02] you're not being fed.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; So who are you serving?
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Yourself or God.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; If you're not being fed, find a place
[2:11:10] that you're being fed. Go to church. But
[2:11:12] don't forsake the word because you don't
[2:11:14] feel like it that day
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; because then who becomes God? My
[2:11:19] feelings become the God I worship.
[2:11:20] Because I'll lay down the word for my
[2:11:22] own feelings. That means I worship my
[2:11:24] feelings more than I worship God. Right.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; This man wasn't getting something out of
[2:11:29] it. He was giving something.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We go to church so many times
[2:11:34] selfishly to get something. Amen. Why
[2:11:37] don't we come to give something? Amen.
[2:11:39] I'm here to give praise to God. I'm here
[2:11:41] to give worship to God. I'm here. Hey,
[2:11:43] listen. If I have to suffer through a
[2:11:44] bumbling, fumbling preacher who can't do
[2:11:46] anything, it doesn't matter. I'm going
[2:11:48] to say amen. If the only thing I can say
[2:11:50] amen to is when he reads the scripture,
[2:11:51] I'll say amen when he reads the
[2:11:53] scripture. Because I want God to know I
[2:11:54] love him and I love his word and I'm
[2:11:56] here in obedience to his word. I'm not
[2:11:58] here because this delighted me. I'm not
[2:12:00] here because it's the greatest thing
[2:12:01] that ever happened to me. I'm here in
[2:12:03] obedience to this word as a sacrifice.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm not just preaching on church
[2:12:13] attendance. I'm preaching on life,
[2:12:14] friends.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; So many people get upset at this kind of
[2:12:18] preaching. But why do we come to church?
[2:12:19] Brother Brennham said to see our bad
[2:12:21] parts. We come to get a checkup. We come
[2:12:24] to find out where the devil's taking
[2:12:26] advantage of us. We come to find out
[2:12:28] where we're sulking and sucking our
[2:12:29] thumb and being babyed and babying
[2:12:31] ourselves and get back to being rugged
[2:12:33] Christians that can take the word.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. When did we become lazy, soft?
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Don't think I'm preaching
[2:12:42] to you. I'm preaching to me, too. I get
[2:12:44] embarrassed of myself.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Why can't I get out of bed when I want
[2:12:47] to get out of bed to prayer? Why do I
[2:12:49] give myself extra time? Why don't I give
[2:12:51] him extra time?
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I need to come back to my first love
[2:12:56] and get my priorities right again and
[2:12:58] find out who's God and who I am. I'm
[2:13:00] nothing. He's everything.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; My comfort's nothing. My pleasure is
[2:13:04] nothing. His pleasure is everything to
[2:13:07] me.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we come to church so we we
[2:13:14] can tell everybody how good you are.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; You're so good. You're so nice. You're
[2:13:18] so lovely. You're so sweet. You're doing
[2:13:20] a good job. Thank you for coming today.
[2:13:24] Why should you be thanked for coming?
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; You should be thankful you can come.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Thankful you have health. Thankful you
[2:13:33] have a place. Thankful the doors are
[2:13:35] open. Thankful they haven't closed them
[2:13:36] yet. Thankful that there's brothers and
[2:13:38] sisters that want to hear the word. We
[2:13:40] should be thanking God we get to come.
[2:13:42] Not being thanked because you showed up
[2:13:44] today. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, it
[2:13:46] was so nice for you to come.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got the picture
[2:13:49] completely backwards.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; I want God to be up here and everything
[2:13:54] about me to be down here.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; I want to take the reproach. Amen. I
[2:13:59] want to take the low place.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; I want to become nothing
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; so he can become everything in my life.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; We get an American leodyian spirit and
[2:14:08] it creeps into our sticky cobburn
[2:14:10] nature. And we need broke out of that
[2:14:12] spirit.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; We all need it. Every one of us need
[2:14:16] broke out of that every once in a while.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; We need God to come and tell us what's
[2:14:21] real and what's true.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; What matters the most.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Quit giving God what's easy.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Give him what he deserves.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Get him what he's worthy of.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Man, we wouldn't give our bosses what we
[2:14:38] give to God.
[2:14:41] Yes, sir.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Somehow I can't seem to find a way to
[2:14:45] get to church on time.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's a good idea
[2:14:48] to come 30 minutes early and get quiet.
[2:14:50] Can't do that.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; But yet we'll show up at work on time
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; every time because my paycheck depends
[2:14:58] on that. My performance review depends
[2:15:00] on that because it serves me. It's the
[2:15:02] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[2:15:04] the pride of life. And I'll sacrifice
[2:15:06] for work.
[2:15:08] But will I sacrifice for the word of
[2:15:10] God?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. How can we give an earthly job
[2:15:15] more than we give God?
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; God help us. How many want to say, "God,
[2:15:25] circumcise my heart.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Circumcise it fresh today that I can
[2:15:29] love you the way you deserve to be
[2:15:30] loved. I can love you with all my heart
[2:15:32] and all my soul and that you can have
[2:15:34] the first place in my life."
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:37] Amen.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, God is good.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And instead of going home today
[2:15:44] and saying that was rubbing, you should
[2:15:45] go home to say, "Thank you, God. That
[2:15:47] was exactly what I needed."
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; And don't tell me you don't need it
[2:15:52] because I need it. You need it. Every
[2:15:54] one of us need it. Cuz we live in
[2:15:55] Leodysia and a sticky cocker bird
[2:15:57] nature. And we need to hear what's real.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; We don't need petted and stroked. We
[2:16:03] need to hear what's real, what's true.
[2:16:06] Amen. And we need that truth to strike
[2:16:08] our soul and something inside go ding
[2:16:10] ding. That's nothing but the truth.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; I may not be measuring up and I may be
[2:16:15] embarrassed about myself right now, but
[2:16:17] that's still the truth.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; God circumcised my heart.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Circumcised my heart.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells a story and I'm going
[2:16:28] to finish with this story.
[2:16:33] says,
[2:16:36] he says, she gets her coin and stays
[2:16:39] with it. I can see her put it in her
[2:16:41] sock. She's talking about a harlot
[2:16:43] woman,
[2:16:44] little harlot woman who's trapped in in
[2:16:48] prostitution and she wants to get out
[2:16:49] and she's saving all of her money so
[2:16:52] that she can buy her way out of
[2:16:53] prostitution.
[2:16:54] She was sold into it because she was
[2:16:56] abandoned and sent on the street when
[2:16:58] she was a little girl. We find her in
[2:17:00] the Bible and Brother Ben tells us the
[2:17:02] background of her story. She's got a
[2:17:04] little sock and she's got a little
[2:17:06] hidden place there in her room where she
[2:17:08] hides this sock and she's been dropping
[2:17:09] these coins in. And how did she earn the
[2:17:12] coins? By prostitution,
[2:17:16] but it's the only thing she had is the
[2:17:17] only choice that she had. And she's
[2:17:19] saving it up to buy herself a better
[2:17:22] life and an escape out of this life. And
[2:17:25] he says, I can see her put it in her
[2:17:27] sock. She gathered up her clothes, put
[2:17:30] them around her, and on the street she
[2:17:32] goes. She goes into a perfume shop, and
[2:17:36] there's an old Jew fellow sitting there
[2:17:37] saying, "My why, the business has been
[2:17:39] bad today. I haven't even made rent."
[2:17:42] Here comes this woman in he comes out.
[2:17:45] He doesn't act nice. He says, "And how
[2:17:48] do you He doesn't say, "How do you do?
[2:17:49] What could I do for you?" He says,
[2:17:50] "Well, what do you want?"
[2:17:54] She said, 'I want the best spike nerd
[2:17:56] box you've got.
[2:17:58] Listen to the words. Best.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Not good, not nice, not precious.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Best.
[2:18:09] I want the best spike nerd spike nerd
[2:18:11] box you got. And she lays the money
[2:18:13] down. When he hears the clink of the
[2:18:15] money, oh, that's different. So he said,
[2:18:18] see how much you got. and he counted out
[2:18:20] 280 Roman daenery and it's just enough.
[2:18:24] So he gives it to her. I can hear him
[2:18:26] say, "Wonder where she's going. Wonder
[2:18:28] what she's going to do with that." That
[2:18:30] was the last penny she had and she knew
[2:18:33] it. She dropped her last penny on this
[2:18:38] box of ointment.
[2:18:42] And she knew he was deserving the best.
[2:18:45] She never said, "Give me a good one."
[2:18:47] She didn't say, "Give me a good
[2:18:48] ointment." She said, "Give me the best
[2:18:50] you got." Praise God. That's what we
[2:18:53] ought to do. Give him the best there is.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; The youth of our life, the best of your
[2:18:58] life, the praise of your lips.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; We know this is the woman who anointed
[2:19:05] Jesus' feet in Simon's house.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; But tells us more of her life. Amen. We
[2:19:10] know that she was a sinner and she had
[2:19:12] many sins and and and she saw Jesus
[2:19:15] there invited but unwelcome
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; sitting there. They had done the minimum
[2:19:22] they could do for him.
[2:19:25] They had invited him. Sure. They had
[2:19:28] brought him in and allowed him inside
[2:19:30] and they had allowed him a seat at the
[2:19:32] table. That was the minimum that they
[2:19:35] could do. That's right.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; They didn't anoint him with perfume.
[2:19:40] They didn't wash his feet. They they
[2:19:42] didn't embrace him and kiss him. They
[2:19:44] didn't do any of that. They just did the
[2:19:46] minimum. And she saw him sitting there
[2:19:48] with dirty feet, having been received
[2:19:52] into a home and invited into a home, but
[2:19:54] nobody served him like he deserved to be
[2:19:57] served. And this harlot woman, something
[2:20:00] inside of her, listen friends, this
[2:20:03] isn't something you teach. this isn't
[2:20:05] something you're trained into. There was
[2:20:06] something inside of her that said, "I've
[2:20:08] got to do him a service.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; I He deserves better than this. He can't
[2:20:13] sit there like that. I can't allow this
[2:20:15] to happen."
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; She runs back to her room and she takes
[2:20:20] out the money that she was hoping to
[2:20:22] change her life with the money that
[2:20:23] would be her redemption out of
[2:20:25] prostitution. And she takes and she
[2:20:27] dumps the whole sockload, every penny,
[2:20:29] to the last penny to buy the very best
[2:20:32] ointment that's in that store. and she
[2:20:34] runs into where Jesus is quickly before
[2:20:37] they could stop her. Amen. There was
[2:20:38] something pushing her from within. There
[2:20:40] was a motivation beyond her brain. There
[2:20:43] was something in her. She had to get to
[2:20:45] Christ and she had to give her best to
[2:20:47] him. And he deserved more than he was
[2:20:48] getting.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Listen, he deserves more than he's
[2:20:52] getting in this world, friends.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; But his name will be greatly declared
[2:20:57] amongst the heathen. Amen. Amongst the
[2:20:58] Gentiles. That's us. Amen. And his
[2:21:01] name's going to be glorified amongst us.
[2:21:05] She drops at his feet. She begins to
[2:21:07] weep all over his feet to wash his feet
[2:21:09] with tears. And she breaks the box open
[2:21:12] and pours out. I love this scripture.
[2:21:16] She didn't open it in the corner and dip
[2:21:18] it out. She broke that thing and poured
[2:21:20] out everything she had. She gave to
[2:21:23] Christ to what? To anoint his feet with
[2:21:26] oil. Oh my goodness. They were sitting
[2:21:28] in the room and they were saying what a
[2:21:30] waste this was. This was an absolute
[2:21:32] waste. That was so expensive. There's so
[2:21:34] many poor. She's wasting everything. And
[2:21:36] Jesus said, "She's not wasting anything.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; She's giving me her best." Amen. All
[2:21:42] that she has, her whole life, and her
[2:21:45] hope for a future, she's pouring it out
[2:21:47] at Jesus's feet. And Jesus didn't stop
[2:21:49] her or call it a waste. I don't think we
[2:21:51] can ever waste our life serving the
[2:21:53] Lord. Waste him, waste our time, waste
[2:21:56] our efforts, waste our money, waste our
[2:21:58] mind on God.
[2:22:02] It's a waste. You gave up your job. You
[2:22:05] refused a promotion because it would
[2:22:06] take you away from church. You refused
[2:22:08] this. And you've wasted your
[2:22:10] opportunity. You've wasted your life.
[2:22:12] We've wasted nothing.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Never have I wasted one drop
[2:22:18] that I've poured out in love to God.
[2:22:20] Amen. To sacrifice for him. And I don't
[2:22:22] want to give him that which cost me
[2:22:24] nothing.
[2:22:27] She pours it out.
[2:22:30] Brother Ben uses this story again. He
[2:22:32] says, "He's worthy of the best."
[2:22:37] What do you do for him? Give him the
[2:22:39] leftover. Oh yes, you run around all day
[2:22:41] and give him three minutes at night
[2:22:43] before you go to bed. He deserves your
[2:22:45] best, friends.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; He deserves everything you got. But what
[2:22:48] do you do about it? You give him just
[2:22:50] anything. Listen, he takes it.
[2:22:54] He takes it anyhow.
[2:22:57] This breaks my heart.
[2:23:02] Let me fix this.
[2:23:06] He takes it anyhow.
[2:23:09] Simon invited him to his house. He came
[2:23:11] anyways.
[2:23:13] He didn't welcome him with ointment. He
[2:23:14] didn't welcome him with perfume or feet
[2:23:16] washing or embrace. But he came anyways.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; He came to his house anyways.
[2:23:23] He was stuck in the corner. He sat there
[2:23:25] anyhow.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; They only gave him partial, but he took
[2:23:28] it. And I think, what a gentleman Christ
[2:23:31] is. There's so many times I gave him
[2:23:33] little, but he received it.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; He took it.
[2:23:39] A gentleman like that is drawing the
[2:23:42] best out of me. I don't want to give him
[2:23:44] little anymore just because he'll take
[2:23:47] it.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Said he takes it. But she said, "I want
[2:23:52] the best."
[2:23:53] And it cost her everything she had to
[2:23:55] get the best. That's what you ought to
[2:23:57] do.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Give your best to give him your best.
[2:24:01] Give him the best of your life. Give him
[2:24:03] the best of your songs. Give him all of
[2:24:05] your talent. Give him everything you
[2:24:07] got. Give him your feet. Give him your
[2:24:09] hands. Give him your eyes. Give him your
[2:24:10] mouth. Give him your ears. Give him your
[2:24:12] soul. Give him your heart. Give him your
[2:24:15] praise. Give him everything you got.
[2:24:17] Hallelujah. He deserves the best.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; How many can say
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; amen?
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; He deserves the best of my time. He
[2:24:24] deserves the best of my mind. He
[2:24:26] deserves the best of whatever that I can
[2:24:28] give. He deserves the best.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; In this message here, Brother Bam says
[2:24:36] she poured the oil upon his feet. The
[2:24:39] whole room lit up with it. It was
[2:24:40] costly. There's nothing too good for
[2:24:43] Jesus. Give him your best. Give him
[2:24:46] everything you got. Your life, your
[2:24:48] soul, your being, your time, all that
[2:24:50] you have. Give it to him.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know how you feel. But
[2:24:57] after going through this note, I feel
[2:25:00] ashamed of myself.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; I feel like I want to do more.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; I feel like I need my heart to be
[2:25:07] circumcised once again.
[2:25:10] I feel like the things of the world have
[2:25:12] gotten too much of my attention and I
[2:25:14] don't want them to take my attention
[2:25:16] away from my Lord.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be weariesome in serving
[2:25:21] God. I don't want it to be tiring.
[2:25:23] Listen, brother Bam says, "A a Christian
[2:25:25] prays and reads his Bible every day."
[2:25:27] Amen. I don't want that to be wear,
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; a task on my check off list, something I
[2:25:32] got to do so I can go on to the rest of
[2:25:34] my day. I want it to be the greatest
[2:25:36] pleasure of my life. I want it to be the
[2:25:38] time that I give to him first before I
[2:25:40] give to anybody else. I want him to
[2:25:41] occupy my mind before my phone occupies
[2:25:44] my mind.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I want to.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Because that's the value of Christ to
[2:25:51] me.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to, that's fine. But I
[2:25:54] want to.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I want to give him my first is the first
[2:25:58] place. I want to give him the best, the
[2:25:59] most. I want to give him what he
[2:26:01] deserves.
[2:26:04] So the value of Christ to me,
[2:26:08] what's the value of Christ to you?
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's the question.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Brother B said, what will you do with
[2:26:14] this Jesus called Christ?
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; What will we do with him?
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; Will we sit him in the corner of our
[2:26:20] house, invite him, but not really serve
[2:26:23] him, ask him to come because we want him
[2:26:25] there because of who he is? That's what
[2:26:27] Simon wanted. Simon wanted him to come
[2:26:29] because of his name, because of who he
[2:26:31] was, and he wanted to brag that he had
[2:26:33] Jesus in his house. Amen. But he didn't
[2:26:35] want to serve him. He didn't want to
[2:26:36] love him. He didn't want to give him the
[2:26:38] best that he had.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a Christian because
[2:26:43] of his name. I don't want to ask him in
[2:26:45] my life because of who he is.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; I want to love him because he deserves
[2:26:51] it. I want to give him the best because
[2:26:52] I love him.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:57] Brother said, "Oh, that's what God
[2:27:00] expects you to give him your best. Not
[2:27:04] just a little time on the side, but he
[2:27:06] wants your best. He must have the best."
[2:27:12] Look at what he wrote in Malachi.
[2:27:14] Do you think it matters to him?
[2:27:18] If you don't think it matters, go back
[2:27:19] and read Malachi 1
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; 6-14. It matters to God.
[2:27:25] It matters how we love him and how we
[2:27:27] serve him and how we give to him. It
[2:27:30] matters to God. And if it matters to
[2:27:32] him, I want to give him all my love and
[2:27:35] all my time and all my attention. And if
[2:27:38] I get out of sorts, I need a
[2:27:40] redirection. God, redirect me.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I let's let's think of
[2:27:47] Paul. I'm not saying that I've already
[2:27:49] attained,
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; but I'm reaching forth
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; for that which I'm striving for.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; I'm forgetting the things that in past
[2:27:57] I'm reaching forward, reaching higher
[2:27:59] for the mark of the high calling in
[2:28:01] Christ Jesus. And if in anything I'm
[2:28:03] otherwise minded, may God even reveal
[2:28:05] this to me.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to leave you with this.
[2:28:12] Said, "We are saved by grace." Yes,
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; And that through faith, not by works.
[2:28:18] Works shows that you have been saved.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; But what saves you is the grace of God.
[2:28:22] Grace saves you. Grace is what God does
[2:28:25] for you. Works is what you do for God to
[2:28:27] show appreciation of what God did for
[2:28:31] you.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Do we have appreciation
[2:28:37] for what he did for me?
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Do we understand what grace has done for
[2:28:42] me?
[2:28:44] Listen, you don't have to come to church
[2:28:46] to be saved.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; You don't have there. There's nothing
[2:28:52] you have to do. The only thing you have
[2:28:53] to do is believe.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; But if you believe, your faith will move
[2:28:59] you to the word of God.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; And because you believe,
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; you can't help it. You just believe.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; And faith begins to act and works. And
[2:29:08] it's our appreciation.
[2:29:11] Listen, when that little woman come and
[2:29:13] wash Jesus's feet with that precious
[2:29:15] ointment,
[2:29:17] Jesus never looked at her and said,
[2:29:19] "Your deed has saved you."
[2:29:22] What did he say? He said, "Your faith
[2:29:25] has saved you."
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; She wasn't saved because she poured out
[2:29:29] the oil.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; That was not her salvation.
[2:29:33] She was saved because she believed this
[2:29:35] was Messiah.
[2:29:37] the present tense word made flesh and
[2:29:40] that was her salvation. And that's
[2:29:41] salvation today.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; It's just the same as it was then.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; So why did she pour out the oil?
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; Because she believed he was the Messiah
[2:29:52] and worthy of that kind of worship.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because she gave her money. It
[2:30:05] wasn't because she pushed her way in.
[2:30:07] Amen. Through the shame as she felt at
[2:30:10] all the eyes staring at her and knowing
[2:30:12] that they were judging her for what she
[2:30:14] was, but she went through the reproach.
[2:30:18] That wasn't what saved her.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; The money she spent, the the tears she
[2:30:23] poured out, the the oil she poured, that
[2:30:25] was not her salvation.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; Her salvation was that she believed this
[2:30:30] is the truth.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; He's the one. This is the word. That's
[2:30:34] what saved her.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; So why did she do all of that? Because
[2:30:39] she believed this was the one.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; This is him and he's worthy to be
[2:30:45] praised.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; Your church attendance won't save you.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Your taking the sacraments won't save
[2:30:52] you.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; You can come to church every time the
[2:30:56] doors are open. That won't equal
[2:30:57] salvation.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; You can take the sacraments every chance
[2:31:01] you get. That won't equal salvation.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; You can dress right, talk right, live
[2:31:06] right, do right. You can have morning
[2:31:08] devotions for an hour and a half every
[2:31:10] morning. That won't save you.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Salvation is faith alone
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; But if I believe that this is Christ,
[2:31:23] how can I not serve him?
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; How can I not give my best? How can I
[2:31:29] not read his message? How can I not
[2:31:31] listen to it? How can I not read his
[2:31:33] Bible? How can I not pray to him? How
[2:31:34] can I not gather with the saints?
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Beam said, "If God is in your
[2:31:40] heart, you can't wait for them doors to
[2:31:41] open."
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "If you don't feel that
[2:31:45] way, you better get to praying."
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; And I believe the prophet was right.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't feel that way. That's
[2:31:52] true. That's time to get to praying.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, let me see a picture
[2:31:58] different than what I'm seeing now.
[2:32:00] Let me see the privilege that I have,
[2:32:02] the blessing that I have, your goodness
[2:32:04] in my opportunity
[2:32:06] just to do one little service to you.
[2:32:10] One little sacrifice of my time, one
[2:32:15] little thing you've asked for that I
[2:32:18] have the privilege to do. Let me see it
[2:32:20] as a great opportunity to express love
[2:32:22] back to you. Let me not be weary. Let it
[2:32:26] not become weariesome to me, but it may
[2:32:29] become my pleasure to give whatever I
[2:32:32] can give. Whatever I can do because
[2:32:36] you're worthy.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; Why? So that he'll save me. No. Brother
[2:32:42] Bram says you wasn't saved on any day.
[2:32:44] You was always saved.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Your name was sealed in the lamb's book
[2:32:47] of life before the foundation of the
[2:32:48] world. Good, bad, or indifferent, it was
[2:32:51] there.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; But I want to do it in appreciation.
[2:32:56] of what you did for me.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together.
[2:33:02] Musicians, if you'll come.
[2:33:05] Brother Blake, if you'll make your way
[2:33:06] up.
[2:33:15] I pray that I never get so spiritual
[2:33:19] that I forget to serve him.
[2:33:22] I pray that I never get so revelated
[2:33:25] that I don't have to sacrifice my life
[2:33:27] for him anymore.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; I pray that I never get to that place
[2:33:30] where I have such a mind of
[2:33:32] understanding that I fall back on
[2:33:34] predestination but no longer have a
[2:33:36] desire to sacrifice my life for him to
[2:33:39] give him back what he's asked for
[2:33:42] because I have a revelation of
[2:33:44] predestination. I don't have to do these
[2:33:46] things.
[2:33:47] Well my that's true.
[2:33:50] You know what? You don't have to.
[2:33:53] But oh, I think I get to.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; I thank God for whatever it is that I
[2:34:00] can do. Bear a reproach. Testify of his
[2:34:03] word. Stand for the truth. Stand with my
[2:34:05] brother and sister. Fellowship. Whatever
[2:34:08] it is that I can do, I want to do it
[2:34:10] with all my heart
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; for him.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Not for me. For him.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads together.
[2:34:21] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Lord.
[2:34:24] So thankful, God, that
[2:34:27] you're still a God who corrects your
[2:34:29] children.
[2:34:31] And Lord, as I was awake all night,
[2:34:34] Lord, thinking of these things, I
[2:34:36] realized my lack, Lord, where I failed,
[2:34:40] where I've been distracted, where I've
[2:34:41] been caught up. And Lord, I'm sorry,
[2:34:44] Lord.
[2:34:45] You deserve better than what you've been
[2:34:47] getting out of me. And I want you to
[2:34:50] have more. Lord, I pray you come and
[2:34:53] circumcise my heart again. Lord,
[2:34:55] circumcise it aresh that I could love
[2:34:57] you with all my heart and all my soul
[2:34:59] and all my mind. For God, I need your
[2:35:02] help, Lord. And God, what I want is you
[2:35:05] to have my life. I want to take the
[2:35:06] attitude of Moses. I want to take the
[2:35:08] approach of the Apostle Paul. I want to
[2:35:10] follow after the prophet in this age
[2:35:13] where we sacrifice, where we'll bear
[2:35:15] reproach, where we'll take being called
[2:35:18] names.
[2:35:19] We'll give up our reputation and give up
[2:35:21] our time. Give up whatever we have to
[2:35:24] give up for you, Lord. God, I pray you'd
[2:35:28] come across this congregation. And Lord,
[2:35:31] if there's any that's found themselves
[2:35:32] in a place they don't want to be, I pray
[2:35:35] you'd come and circumcise their heart. A
[2:35:37] fresh God, as they just pour their heart
[2:35:40] out to you, Lord, I pray you'd come and
[2:35:42] pour back into us, Lord, a a ferveny, a
[2:35:45] first love, a desire, and an
[2:35:47] opportunity, Lord, that we can see
[2:35:49] around us to serve you better, Lord
[2:35:52] Jesus. I don't want to give you what
[2:35:53] cost me nothing, but I want to give you
[2:35:55] my life.
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; You've given me everything, Lord, and
[2:35:59] I'm so privileged.
[2:36:01] I don't want to become nor negligent.
[2:36:04] And I don't want to become, Lord,
[2:36:05] dilatory, but I want to be faithful back
[2:36:08] to you,
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; God. There's a desire in my heart, Lord.
[2:36:11] I feel it bubbling up into the preaching
[2:36:13] of the word. I don't want to be the rich
[2:36:15] young ruler. I want to be the Apostle
[2:36:17] Paul.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be those that walked
[2:36:20] away when you said, "Eat my flesh and
[2:36:22] drink my blood." But I want to be of
[2:36:23] your disciples that said, "To whom will
[2:36:25] we go? Thou alone has the words of
[2:36:27] eternal life." God, I don't want to be
[2:36:30] as the one like Simon who invited you to
[2:36:32] the house but didn't serve you. I want
[2:36:34] to be like that harlot who gave
[2:36:35] everything. It's in my heart, Lord. It's
[2:36:38] bubbling up. It's my desire. Would you
[2:36:40] come, Lord, and help me, God? Move away
[2:36:42] all the trash that's in my life. And
[2:36:44] awaken me, Lord. Freshen inside of me by
[2:36:47] that fresh circumcision of my heart. May
[2:36:50] I give back to you what you deserve, for
[2:36:52] you deserve it all, Lord, and you
[2:36:54] deserve much more than I can give. If I
[2:36:56] had 10,000 lives to serve you and I gave
[2:36:59] them all for you, it wouldn't be enough
[2:37:01] for what you deserve.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. May you become the
[2:37:06] object of our worship and the greatest
[2:37:08] thing in our lives. I ask it in Jesus
[2:37:11] Christ's name. Help us now, Lord. Amen.
[2:37:16] Amen. May God bless you. Just want to
[2:37:18] remind you of communion this afternoon
[2:37:20] at 4 if you want to come back for that
[2:37:23] and say, God bless you all. like
[2:37:28] worthy.

[2:39:08] King of kings, Lord of lords.
[2:39:13] I worship you.
[2:39:17] Amen.
[2:39:20] Let's sing that other song.
[2:39:24] And
[2:39:25] Lord,
[2:39:27] you are
[2:39:30] more precious
[2:39:33] than silver.
[2:39:38] And Lord,
[2:39:41] you are
[2:39:45] more costly
[2:39:49] than
[2:39:54] Lord.
[2:39:57] You are
[2:40:01] Lord. Beautiful
[2:40:05] and diamonds
[2:40:09] and nothing
[2:40:12] I
[2:40:13] desire
[2:40:15] compares
[2:40:17] with you.
[2:40:20] Sing it again.
[2:40:24] And Lord,
[2:40:28] you are
[2:40:32] more preious
[2:40:35] than silver.
[2:40:40] And Lord,
[2:40:43] you are
[2:40:47] more cost
[2:40:51] than gold.
[2:40:56] And Lord,
[2:40:59] you are
[2:41:03] more beautiful
[2:41:06] than
[2:41:11] nothing
[2:41:13] I
[2:41:15] desire
[2:41:17] compares
[2:41:19] with you.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time.
[2:41:26] And Lord,
[2:41:29] you are
[2:41:33] more precious
[2:41:37] than silver.
[2:41:42] Lord,
[2:41:45] you are
[2:41:49] more costly
[2:41:52] than gold.
[2:41:57] Lord,
[2:42:00] you are
[2:42:04] more beautiful
[2:42:08] than diamonds.
[2:42:12] And nothing
[2:42:14] I
[2:42:16] desire
[2:42:18] compares
[2:42:20] with you.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd like to sing that one more
[2:42:25] time. But let it be a heart craving. Let
[2:42:28] it be a prayer,
[2:42:30] Lord, that I recognize there's nothing I
[2:42:33] desire more than you. And I know in some
[2:42:38] ways I'm preaching to the choir. You
[2:42:40] drive hour, 2 hours, 2 and 1/2 hours to
[2:42:42] come to church. You've sacrificed.
[2:42:44] You've moved. You've you've given up
[2:42:46] jobs and families. And I know. And in
[2:42:50] the past, we did. We drove almost two
[2:42:52] hours to come to church for years and
[2:42:54] years with we we did it because
[2:42:55] something inside of us was driving us,
[2:42:57] friends. Something was pushing us. It
[2:43:00] wasn't cuz we had to. It's because we
[2:43:02] could not help it. We wanted to be
[2:43:05] there. But I know what it's like to be
[2:43:07] driven. And I know what it's like to
[2:43:08] cool off. I know what it's like to that
[2:43:12] drive then to begin to cool and and have
[2:43:14] to be revived again.
[2:43:16] I know what it's like to get weary and
[2:43:18] get battle scarred and get beat up. And
[2:43:20] I know what it's like to draw back. I've
[2:43:22] done it. And sometimes my heart draws
[2:43:25] back and I don't want it to draw back.
[2:43:28] Man, I come to church. I have no choice.
[2:43:32] Amen. Thank God he's taken away my
[2:43:35] choice cuz it's helped me so much. But I
[2:43:39] know we all we all go up and we go down
[2:43:42] and we have good days and bad days. But
[2:43:45] all friends, there's nothing like
[2:43:47] serving God.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like giving him our all.
[2:43:52] There's nothing like worshiping him.
[2:43:54] There's nothing like going from weeping
[2:43:56] cuz you're heartbroken and forcing
[2:43:59] yourself to put a song of praise on your
[2:44:01] lips and lift your hand. Not because you
[2:44:03] feel good, but lift your hand and say,
[2:44:06] "God, you are good." Because he is good.
[2:44:10] On my worst day, he's worthy of my
[2:44:13] praise.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:15] Oh, I know what it's like, friends. I
[2:44:18] know. But oh, may God help us with a
[2:44:21] fresh circumcision. And may this song
[2:44:23] become a prayer. It may listen, if
[2:44:26] things have grown cold, if things have
[2:44:28] become a little indifferent and if life
[2:44:30] has knocked you around a bit and you've
[2:44:32] lost focus a little bit. Amen. Let this
[2:44:34] be the day that your focus comes back
[2:44:36] into view and you realize, "Oh, God,
[2:44:40] don't ever let this slip away. this love
[2:44:42] for you, this desire to serve you, this
[2:44:44] ferveny in my heart.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; Never let it slip, man. I just encourage
[2:44:50] you to sing it as a prayer and then
[2:44:52] pray. Just tell God you love him more
[2:44:55] than anything.
[2:44:57] Man, that's my desire. Let's sing this
[2:44:59] together.
[2:45:02] will Lord
[2:45:06] you are
[2:45:10] more preious
[2:45:14] than silver
[2:45:19] Lord.
[2:45:22] You are
[2:45:25] more costly
[2:45:29] than gold.
[2:45:34] Lord,
[2:45:36] you are
[2:45:40] more beautiful
[2:45:44] than diamonds.
[2:45:48] And nothing
[2:45:50] I My desire
[2:45:54] compares
[2:45:55] with you.
[2:46:03] And Lord,
[2:46:06] you are
[2:46:10] more precious
[2:46:14] than silver.
[2:46:18] And Lord,
[2:46:21] you are
[2:46:25] more costly
[2:46:28] than old
[2:46:33] and Lord,
[2:46:36] you are
[2:46:40] more beautiful
[2:46:44] than diamonds.
[2:46:48] Nothing
[2:46:50] I
[2:46:51] desire
[2:46:55] with you.
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; Well, now I'm giving my life
[2:47:06] away.
[2:47:11] Lay it down the altar.
[2:47:16] Lord,
[2:47:18] I'm giving my life
[2:47:21] away.
[2:47:26] The very least I can offer
[2:47:31] is my hope.
[2:47:39] So here I stand
[2:47:42] today
[2:47:45] giving my life
[2:47:48] away once more.
[2:47:53] Oh now I'm giving my life
[2:47:59] away.
[2:48:03] Lay it down on the altar.
[2:48:09] Now I'm giving my life
[2:48:14] away.
[2:48:18] Oh, the very least I can offer
[2:48:24] is my hope.
[2:48:32] And so here I stand
[2:48:35] today
[2:48:38] giving my life
[2:48:41] away
[2:48:42] too.
[2:48:47] And no earthly price could be too great.
[2:48:54] And no sacriice
[2:48:58] too much to make.
[2:49:02] No way. Measuring
[2:49:07] the cost
[2:49:10] next to the blood
[2:49:12] of Calary's
[2:49:15] cross.
[2:49:17] And so if I live,
[2:49:20] I live for him.
[2:49:25] For if I die,
[2:49:27] I count it gain.
[2:49:32] My life is not my own, but his from this
[2:49:40] day on.
[2:49:46] And now I'm giving my life
[2:49:52] away.
[2:49:56] Laying it down on the altar.
[2:50:02] Now I'm giving my life away.
[2:50:12] The very least I can offer
[2:50:17] is my own.
[2:50:25] So here I stand
[2:50:28] today
[2:50:30] giving my life
[2:50:33] away. I'm giving my life.
[2:50:39] And now I'm giving my life
[2:50:45] away.
[2:50:49] Lay it down on the altar.
[2:50:55] Lord, I'm giving my life away.
[2:51:04] Oh, the very least I can offer
[2:51:10] is my all.
[2:51:18] So here I stand
[2:51:20] today
[2:51:23] giving my life
[2:51:26] away.
