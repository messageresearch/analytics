[10:41] [Music]
[10:51] lord
[10:55] speak
[10:56] to me
[10:59] [Music]
[11:16] amen let's pray together
[11:19] precious lord jesus we just want to
[11:22] pause here once again and approach you
[11:24] by way of prayer
[11:26] father thanking you for this
[11:28] opportunity that you've given to us once
[11:31] again to
[11:32] come and to worship you father and to
[11:35] be a privileged people to not come and
[11:38] worship in vain but to come and into
[11:41] worship and spirit and truth
[11:44] lord and as we
[11:45] just sang father we
[11:47] want you to come and speak to us lord
[11:49] that we could leave this this building
[11:52] this morning that you would have the
[11:54] capacity to speak to the world through
[11:56] us
[11:57] father for we know that is your
[11:59] declaration and your instructions at the
[12:01] end of the book
[12:03] lord for us to go forth as your bride
[12:06] and to prophesy again lord but how would
[12:09] we be capable to do that lord if you
[12:11] would not first come and speak to us
[12:13] lord how would we know what to say or
[12:15] what to do father
[12:17] so we just asked that you would come and
[12:19] that you would do both parts lord that
[12:21] you would plant the seed and that you
[12:23] would make the seed to produce that
[12:25] which it was planted for
[12:27] we just want to come and commit
[12:28] ourselves to you father
[12:30] lord we stand here as mere mortals lord
[12:35] one not having the capacity to speak
[12:37] that which is needed and the other not
[12:40] having the capacity to even hear that
[12:42] which is needed to be heard unless you
[12:45] would come father and anoint both the
[12:47] speaker and the hearer
[12:48] so we just commit ourselves completely
[12:50] to you thanking you once again for this
[12:52] opportunity
[12:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[12:55] pray amen
[12:58] god bless you this morning i trust
[13:00] everybody is
[13:02] feeling well and doing good and if
[13:05] you're not then
[13:06] i hope when we're done you're feeling
[13:08] well and doing good
[13:10] but if you have your bibles we'll go to
[13:13] john 16
[13:16] and probably not a big shock to most of
[13:19] you but i just want to continue with
[13:20] this thought of he
[13:22] the spirit of truth
[13:24] and
[13:26] i'm kind of stuck on this
[13:28] and i'm not real sure when i'll get
[13:30] unstuck on it so you either just have to
[13:33] enjoy it with me or
[13:35] bear the burden so you can take your
[13:37] pick
[13:38] but in john 16
[13:42] beginning in verse 12
[13:44] i want to
[13:46] read this portion of scripture
[13:48] it says i have jesus speaking he says i
[13:51] have yet many things to say unto you
[13:54] but you cannot bear them now
[13:57] how be it when he
[13:59] the spirit of truth is come he will
[14:02] guide you into all truth
[14:04] for he shall not speak of himself but
[14:07] whatsoever he shall hear
[14:09] that shall he speak and he will show you
[14:11] things to come
[14:13] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[14:16] of mine and shall show it unto you god
[14:20] bless you as you would have your seats
[14:23] and just
[14:26] so that you know i do have a quote for
[14:28] getting stuck on this subject and i want
[14:30] to read it to you
[14:31] in the church age book brother branham
[14:33] says
[14:34] he's quoting a theologian from the 1600s
[14:37] and he says in divine service
[14:40] the words of men are usually heard more
[14:43] than the word of god
[14:45] each one shatters as he pleases or kills
[14:48] time by learned disquisitions and
[14:51] disproving the views of others
[14:54] of the new birth
[14:56] and how a man must be changed into the
[14:58] likeness of christ to become partakers
[15:01] of the divine nature
[15:03] scarcely
[15:04] anything is said
[15:06] so there's my quote for getting stuck on
[15:09] this subject i don't want to be guilty
[15:11] of that i don't want to be guilty of
[15:13] chattering as i please or disproving the
[15:16] views of others and scarcely saying
[15:19] anything of the new birth and how that
[15:22] we must become partakers of the divine
[15:25] nature so that's definitely the thrust
[15:27] of this topic that's definitely the
[15:30] the inspiration that i have behind this
[15:33] and you know we've said a lot and no
[15:35] doubt we'll say more but we don't want
[15:37] to lose
[15:39] focus of the real point of this entire
[15:42] subject and the real point is i
[15:45] my burden just my personal burden
[15:47] is to
[15:49] go back
[15:50] and get a clear and proper understanding
[15:54] of a scriptural definition
[15:58] as taught by brother branham
[16:01] of the new birth
[16:02] and of the baptism of the holy spirit
[16:05] and what that entails because as i said
[16:07] before
[16:08] there is times that
[16:10] we we cannot find what we're seeking
[16:14] if we don't know what we're seeking for
[16:16] and there are times that we can find
[16:19] something
[16:20] and obtain something and yet not know
[16:23] what that is and i've gave you the
[16:25] example before of the interview that
[16:26] brother branham did with sister bruce
[16:28] this was a lady who did have the baptism
[16:30] of the holy spirit but in herself she
[16:33] was completely tore up day in and day
[16:36] out because she failed to recognize what
[16:40] it was that had changed her
[16:42] so i just want to again this is not what
[16:45] i would consider a deep topic or you
[16:48] know spiritual rocket science but this
[16:51] is something that is just a burden on me
[16:53] i i want to i personally want to be
[16:56] settled
[16:58] and i want to be confident and i want to
[17:00] be established in what god has done in
[17:02] my life and i want to recognize that for
[17:05] what it is
[17:07] and i also want to be fellowshipping
[17:09] with a group of people that are in that
[17:11] same position so
[17:15] if you don't have this experience and it
[17:17] is an experience
[17:19] if you don't have this experience
[17:22] you need to get this experience but you
[17:24] need to get this experience based on
[17:26] what the prophet has taught us from the
[17:29] scriptures
[17:30] not not anything else not somebody
[17:32] else's experience
[17:35] but we have to get this experience per
[17:38] what the prophet has taught us from the
[17:39] scriptures so if you don't have it you
[17:41] need to get it but if you do have it you
[17:45] need to allow it to bring its scriptural
[17:49] definition which is the comforter into
[17:52] your life
[17:53] and when the comforter comes into your
[17:55] life it is going to have the capacity to
[17:57] bring a settledness and a stability to
[18:00] you that no man can and that's only
[18:03] going to come by one way that's either
[18:04] that's going to come by recognizing
[18:08] he
[18:08] the spirit of truth has come into your
[18:11] life
[18:16] so the points here is a
[18:19] scriptural definition
[18:21] of receiving the holy spirit is taught
[18:23] by brother branham
[18:25] and there's two prongs that go with that
[18:28] we can never forget that the spirit and
[18:31] the word are the self-same being
[18:36] whenever we separate the spirit in the
[18:38] word and make them something different
[18:40] that's automatically not what paul
[18:43] taught
[18:44] and it's automatically not what brother
[18:46] branham taught and it automatically will
[18:48] put you into a denominational realm into
[18:51] a denominational spirit because that is
[18:53] exactly what all of the denominations
[18:56] have done
[18:58] they have separated the evidence from
[19:02] receiving the word
[19:04] and because they've done that now they
[19:06] have the ability to leave the word
[19:10] it's that simple
[19:12] so
[19:13] we must not under any circumstances
[19:16] allow the spirit and the word to become
[19:19] something different to us
[19:21] they are the self-same being you cannot
[19:24] receive this the holy spirit without
[19:27] receiving the holy word
[19:30] the holy spirit comes writing on the
[19:34] holy word
[19:36] you must receive the word for your age
[19:39] in order to receive the holy spirit you
[19:41] cannot receive it any other way if you
[19:44] could receive it any other way that
[19:46] takes our message and does away with it
[19:48] it is not necessary
[19:51] again this is very simple but i just
[19:53] want to make sure that we're established
[19:55] in this and the second prong of that
[19:58] is we we should never overlook or
[20:01] de-emphasize the ability and capacity
[20:05] within ourselves to repent
[20:09] those are the two prongs and the two sec
[20:11] the two things that if you forget
[20:13] everything else that i chatter about
[20:16] don't forget those two things never
[20:18] separate the word and the spirit and
[20:20] never ever ever de-emphasize
[20:24] the ability and capacity that you have
[20:27] in your life to repent
[20:29] because that is a special capacity to a
[20:32] special group of individuals and some of
[20:34] us need it more than others and that's
[20:36] okay
[20:37] but the fact that we have the capacity
[20:41] to always repent and line up to the word
[20:44] of god
[20:46] we should thank god every day for that
[20:47] saints
[20:48] even if we have to use it and do it
[20:50] every day
[20:51] we should thank god for that capacity
[20:53] because it's not about getting it right
[20:56] the first time
[20:59] you would really have to under you know
[21:01] me as a person to know what it means for
[21:03] me to make that statement
[21:05] because i'm a perfectionist and i i have
[21:07] to get it right the first time
[21:09] but
[21:10] in this
[21:11] topic
[21:12] in the grand scheme of things
[21:15] in this what brother branham says this
[21:17] hickey of time that we're in
[21:19] it's not about getting it right the
[21:21] first time every time
[21:23] it's about the ability to repent and
[21:26] line back up with the word
[21:29] i don't have a problem with people
[21:31] getting confused and preaching wrong
[21:33] doctrine
[21:35] what i have a problem with
[21:37] me or anybody else is is once that's
[21:39] exposed as wrong doctrine the inability
[21:42] to repent and line up to the word
[21:46] making a mistake or going in error or
[21:48] getting confused about something or
[21:50] seeing something not exactly right or
[21:52] clear is not the problem
[21:55] that is not the problem
[21:58] because we've all done that
[22:00] and we're all probably doing that right
[22:02] now
[22:03] about something and we're all probably
[22:06] going to do that in the future about
[22:07] something
[22:08] that is not the problem the
[22:11] the problem
[22:13] is kane's problem
[22:15] that's the the that's the original
[22:18] problem i guess it would go farther back
[22:20] than that would be lucifer's problem
[22:22] the inability to humble yourself
[22:27] and line up to the word of god
[22:29] that's the only problem
[22:31] so those are my points let's move on
[22:33] brother random says i referenced this
[22:36] quote to you last time so i wanted to
[22:38] read it to you brother random says in
[22:39] the church
[22:40] book he's quoting revelation
[22:43] he says be zealous and repent he says
[22:45] now this false church has zeal make no
[22:48] mistake about that her zeal has
[22:51] literally been that of the jews john 2
[22:54] 17 the zeal of thine house hath eaten me
[22:57] up but it is a wrong zeal it is for the
[23:00] house of their own building also known
[23:03] as your own idea
[23:05] it is for their own creeds their own dog
[23:08] dogmas organizations their own
[23:11] righteousness they have put the word out
[23:14] for their own ideas
[23:17] they depose the holy ghost and make men
[23:19] into leaders
[23:21] they have put aside eternal life as a
[23:24] person and made it good works or even
[23:27] church conformity rather than good works
[23:30] but god is calling for another zeal it
[23:33] is the zeal to cry i am wrong
[23:39] now who is going to say that he is wrong
[23:44] what is it that all these denominations
[23:47] are based upon the claim to originality
[23:50] and that of god the claim that they are
[23:53] right
[23:55] so if you want to have a denomination
[23:57] all you have to do is depose the word of
[23:59] god and claim that you are right
[24:02] it can be a one-man denomination a
[24:03] one-woman denomination it doesn't have
[24:05] to be a big one
[24:08] they depose the holy ghost
[24:12] but listen what they substitute for that
[24:15] they depose the holy ghost and make men
[24:18] into leaders
[24:22] so this could be another man
[24:24] that you have allowed to take the place
[24:26] of the holy ghost and lead you
[24:29] falsely
[24:30] or this could be yourself
[24:33] that you have allowed to take the place
[24:34] of the holy ghost and lead yourself
[24:36] falsely
[24:40] that is what happens when you depose of
[24:42] the holy ghost
[24:44] of the spirit of truth
[24:48] but brother branham says the zeal
[24:50] is to cry the correct zeal is to cry
[24:54] i
[24:55] am wrong
[24:57] that has been my zeal for the last i
[25:00] don't know how long several months years
[25:02] whatever is i'm waking up every morning
[25:05] and before my feet hit the ground
[25:07] just acknowledge the fact lord i am
[25:10] wrong
[25:11] i'm going to get today wrong if you do
[25:14] not come and supernaturally intervene in
[25:17] my life i'm going to get it wrong
[25:19] that's just the facts
[25:21] i don't stand a chance i don't have a
[25:24] chance
[25:25] i we have got to come to a
[25:28] comfortableness in recognizing our
[25:30] inability to get things right
[25:34] that is the correct and proper zeal
[25:37] to line up to the word
[25:39] not take another man's idea
[25:42] not take our own idea
[25:45] but to line up to the word
[25:47] first john 5 6 says this is he that came
[25:50] by water and blood even christ jesus not
[25:52] by water only but by water and blood it
[25:55] is the spirit that beareth witness
[25:57] because the spirit is truth
[26:01] the spirit
[26:03] is truth the spirit
[26:06] is the word
[26:08] john 15 26 but when the comforter is
[26:11] come
[26:12] whom i shall send unto you from the
[26:14] father even the spirit of truth
[26:18] remember we're looking at a scriptural
[26:21] definition of the holy ghost of the holy
[26:24] spirit of the new birth of the token
[26:27] the spirit of truth
[26:31] john 6 28 then said they unto him what
[26:34] shall we do that we might work the works
[26:36] of god
[26:37] jesus answered and said unto them this
[26:39] is the work of god that ye believe on
[26:42] him who he hath sent
[26:44] and as we would finish this review
[26:46] portion i just want to emphasize that
[26:48] there are going to be many
[26:49] manifestations of the holy ghost of the
[26:52] holy spirit of the working of god there
[26:54] is going to be many manifestations of
[26:57] that but the one baseline manifestation
[27:01] that every true believer must have and
[27:04] will have is they are going to give
[27:06] proper placement
[27:08] and belief
[27:10] in he whom god has sent
[27:14] period
[27:15] if they cannot acknowledge that
[27:19] and they cannot make that their absolute
[27:22] they are not led of the spirit of truth
[27:25] they are not doing the works of god and
[27:28] if they are not doing the works of god
[27:31] there is only one other person's works
[27:33] who they are doing
[27:36] this is the work of god that ye believe
[27:39] on him who he hath sent for our day and
[27:42] for our age we had one messenger and
[27:45] that was brother branham
[27:49] to deviate away from what he taught or
[27:52] to think we have a better idea we have
[27:54] automatically begin working the works of
[27:57] satan
[27:59] because the works of god is to believe
[28:01] on he whom he hath sent
[28:03] so as soon as we deviate from that we
[28:05] are anti-word we are antichrist if you
[28:08] want to get anywhere with god you must
[28:10] first and foremost recognize he whom he
[28:13] hath sent for your age
[28:16] must
[28:17] and then if you really want to get
[28:18] anywhere with god you must recognize who
[28:20] your pastor is
[28:24] that's free but i'll just throw that in
[28:25] there
[28:26] you will never get to your appropriate
[28:29] position in christ without first
[28:30] recognizing who god is
[28:33] who god has sent and who god has placed
[28:35] you under locally
[28:37] it's a chain of command and god has one
[28:39] i can really preach now because i really
[28:41] like chains of command
[28:44] you have to be in your chain of command
[28:46] kid to get anywhere with god
[28:48] if not you're going to find yourself in
[28:51] the middle of a battle when the heat is
[28:52] on wondering what to do and where to go
[28:55] because you don't know who your chain of
[28:57] command is
[28:58] and i just made it real simple your
[29:00] chain of command is god
[29:02] the prophet that he sent to you and your
[29:03] pastor
[29:05] now under that pastor there's many gifts
[29:07] there's many manifestations there's many
[29:09] helps there's many
[29:10] works in the field there's captains
[29:13] there's lieutenants there's sergeants
[29:15] and there's privates
[29:17] so there's people that's actually
[29:18] getting the work done
[29:20] but there's people telling them how to
[29:21] do that and where to go
[29:23] one is just as
[29:24] important as the other it's not
[29:26] necessarily chain of command as in
[29:28] levels of importance
[29:29] it's levels of position levels of
[29:32] placement
[29:34] so in order to really properly do the
[29:36] work of god you must believe on he whom
[29:38] he hath sent
[29:40] and be positionally placed locally where
[29:43] you belong
[29:45] in ashamed brother branham says remember
[29:49] you might meet a spirit that would act
[29:51] like god
[29:52] you might meet a spirit would do this
[29:54] that or the other but follow it a little
[29:56] bit and see how it compares with the
[29:58] word of god
[29:59] you might meet a spirit that would tell
[30:02] you you are saved and give you a
[30:04] glorious feeling and you would shout and
[30:06] scream but then when it comes to denying
[30:09] the word how can the holy spirit that
[30:11] wrote the word deny his own word
[30:16] if it isn't then you never met god you
[30:20] met a deceiving spirit
[30:23] and the world is full of it today
[30:26] what is the world full of
[30:29] a spirit that would make you feel that
[30:32] you are saved give you a glorious
[30:35] feeling make you shout and scream
[30:38] but deny
[30:40] this much of the word
[30:42] that's what the world is full of
[30:45] easter seal brother branham said and the
[30:47] same thing is with every true believer
[30:49] when the preaching of god's word goes
[30:51] forth it is vindicated and proved that
[30:53] it is god's word god's word for the hour
[30:56] then there's something within the
[30:58] believer
[30:59] if that church is teaching crime
[31:02] contrary to this hour of the baptism of
[31:05] the holy ghost message there's something
[31:08] in him that screams out
[31:14] that's what the holy spirit was given to
[31:15] you for
[31:16] that's what he
[31:18] the spirit of truth the comforter the
[31:21] token
[31:22] was given to you for to be able to
[31:25] recognize whether this is the word for
[31:28] my age or is this something contrary
[31:32] he says
[31:33] of the word for the day
[31:35] so does the holy spirit that come upon
[31:38] us in this day
[31:40] if it's not a mockery holy spirit
[31:44] so again we've quoted this several times
[31:46] but we have to recognize that there is a
[31:49] mockery
[31:51] holy spirit
[31:53] a spirit that would make you feel that
[31:55] you're saved scream shout jump dance
[31:59] but is actually mocking the holy spirit
[32:02] which you're truly seeking
[32:04] because it will give you a slight
[32:05] deviation away from the word
[32:08] brother branham says the world is full
[32:10] of that today
[32:12] he says we have to be careful he says
[32:14] because i'm afraid a lot of times we
[32:16] actually just catch a church spirit
[32:19] he says or one another's spirit
[32:23] see we have to come back to a scriptural
[32:27] definition
[32:29] as what the prophet taught or we're
[32:31] going to end up with a spirit making us
[32:34] feel like we're right when we're wrong
[32:37] remember it's to be so close it would
[32:39] deceive the very elected
[32:42] just because you're elected and you're
[32:44] convinced that you'll end up right at
[32:45] the end and i'm convinced you'll end up
[32:47] right at the end
[32:48] don't think that you can't be deceived
[32:50] for a minute
[32:51] don't think you can't take a wrong
[32:53] spirit don't think you can't be confused
[32:56] as soon as we deviate away from the
[32:58] message of the hour we're going to take
[33:00] a wrong spirit and we're going to get
[33:02] confused
[33:03] but if we'll stick with it
[33:06] in its simplicity
[33:09] it alleviates so many problems and it
[33:11] exposes so many problems and attributes
[33:14] of the devil
[33:17] and it brings a settledness to us
[33:19] because i feel and this is just me
[33:21] personally but i feel the reason that we
[33:24] get unsettled
[33:26] even in our later years of life i feel
[33:28] the reason that we get unsettled
[33:31] is we deviate away from the simplicity
[33:33] of the message
[33:36] we feel like we should be doing
[33:38] something more or
[33:39] more dynamic
[33:41] or more manifestations
[33:44] and we get ourselves worked up and
[33:47] unsettled instead of just simply
[33:50] relaxing as job did
[33:54] job said what is the word for my hour
[33:57] i've done it
[33:59] nothing moved job
[34:01] not even the preachers that came to him
[34:04] nothing moved job job had a revelation
[34:07] for the word of his hour what the
[34:08] requirements were for what what the
[34:11] requirements was and he says i've done
[34:13] them
[34:15] there's nothing else to talk about here
[34:18] we're done
[34:19] there is no more word for me to do i've
[34:22] done it i'm fine
[34:23] see job had a confidence in the word
[34:26] just in its simplicity
[34:29] he could relax under that and that's
[34:31] where we need to get to is simply to
[34:33] relax not have to be somebody else
[34:37] not have to have manifestations of
[34:39] somebody else
[34:40] but have to manifest belief in whom god
[34:44] hath sent
[34:45] brother branham says he says if it's not
[34:47] a mockery holy spirit if it's not the
[34:50] devil mocking the holy spirit but it's
[34:51] the real true holy spirit it'll manifest
[34:54] the promise of this hour
[34:58] this is where we can bring a lot of
[35:00] clarification to this because
[35:03] if we didn't know what the promise of
[35:05] this hour was
[35:08] we could interpret this however we
[35:09] wanted to and we could make this
[35:11] whatever we wanted to
[35:13] but
[35:15] when the prophet comes on the scene and
[35:17] he says the manifestation for this hour
[35:20] is the bride
[35:22] christ coming in the form of the bride
[35:25] that is the manifestation for this hour
[35:28] now we can identify what is a mockery
[35:32] holy spirit because a mockery holy
[35:34] spirit will be anything other than the
[35:37] manifestation of the bride of christ in
[35:41] the form of the bride in the form of you
[35:45] that is a mockery holy spirit
[35:48] see if we did if he didn't define these
[35:51] things to us then these statements alone
[35:54] we could still take and make whatever we
[35:56] wanted but that's why we have to take
[35:58] the entirety of the mess the message and
[36:00] allow him to define what the promise of
[36:02] the hour is
[36:04] not make the promise of the hour what we
[36:06] want it to be
[36:07] or what we think it should be
[36:09] we have to make the promise of the hour
[36:11] what he said the promise of the hour was
[36:14] and that is christ in the form of his
[36:15] bride
[36:17] so that may get a little tight that may
[36:19] get a little pinchy but i'm going to say
[36:20] what the prophet said anything that's
[36:22] not declaring that the manifestation for
[36:24] this hour is the bride of jesus christ
[36:26] christ himself in the in a female
[36:29] expression the fullness of the word
[36:32] in a female expression
[36:34] that's a mockery holy spirit
[36:37] it's antichrist
[36:39] it is satan it is a devil
[36:42] and i don't care what other title it
[36:44] brings religious-wise
[36:45] he's already identified it
[36:48] remember brother branham said
[36:51] religion is satan's business
[36:55] so if you're a mockery holy spirit guess
[36:58] what realm you're going to be operating
[37:00] in
[37:01] a religious realm
[37:03] it's not going to be the guy in the bar
[37:05] or the prostitute on the street or
[37:08] whatever nefarious dark evil bad black
[37:11] horse rider you want to think about
[37:14] brother branson it's going to be a
[37:15] slicker
[37:16] that's the one you better watch around
[37:18] your wife who do you think christ is
[37:20] watching around his bride
[37:27] it's a man in a suit
[37:29] with a bible
[37:32] and a slight deviation from the promise
[37:35] of the hour
[37:37] that's who christ is concerned about
[37:39] being around his bride he's not worried
[37:41] about the black horse rider we'll
[37:42] recognize that for what it is
[37:45] so close that it would deceive the very
[37:48] elected a mockery holy spirit is what
[37:52] you understand what i'm saying christ is
[37:54] worried about his brother he's not
[37:55] worried about his bride
[37:58] he knows she's been predestinated
[38:01] but that is
[38:02] who the bride is doing spiritual warfare
[38:05] with
[38:06] that is who he is watching
[38:08] that is who he is guarding her against
[38:12] is that slicker that's what brother
[38:14] that's what the prophet told us
[38:17] a slight deviation away from the word
[38:22] in the church age book i'm not going to
[38:24] read all of this
[38:26] but brother branham says this at this
[38:28] very moment
[38:30] we are in the complete fulfillment of of
[38:32] matthew 24 24
[38:35] in so much that if it were possible they
[38:37] should deceive the very elect and who
[38:40] shall attempt to deceive the very elect
[38:43] why the spirit of antichrist in the
[38:46] false anointed ones
[38:51] but he goes farther and he identifies
[38:53] these false anointed ones
[38:56] he says
[38:57] religious
[38:59] omaha
[39:01] they outshine the elect
[39:03] in effort and zeal
[39:06] but it is lesion
[39:09] not of christ
[39:10] for it looks for big crowds big programs
[39:14] and startling signs amongst them
[39:18] this is where the rubber meets the road
[39:20] they preach the second coming of christ
[39:24] but deny the advent or coming
[39:28] of the prophet messenger
[39:33] remember he's talking about false
[39:35] anointed ones deceiving the very elected
[39:37] if it was possible and he identifies
[39:39] their doctrine as preaching the second
[39:41] coming of christ they will preach the
[39:43] second coming of christ
[39:45] but they deny the coming of the prophet
[39:47] messenger
[39:52] they preach
[39:53] the second coming of christ
[39:56] but they deny the coming of the prophet
[39:59] messenger
[40:02] it would seem to me
[40:04] that the second coming of christ is
[40:06] directly linked to the coming of the
[40:07] prophet
[40:08] messenger and they will preach one but
[40:11] not the other
[40:13] just in case you're missing i'll make it
[40:15] real clear they are preaching a doctrine
[40:18] of the second coming of christ without
[40:20] recognizing that he came in the form of
[40:22] the word through his prophet messenger
[40:26] that is the doctrine that brother
[40:28] branham tied to matthew 24 24.
[40:33] deceiving the elect if it was possible
[40:36] saints if we fail to recognize that
[40:38] christ himself came in 1963 in the form
[40:42] of brother branham
[40:44] the word being manifested in its
[40:46] entirety
[40:48] we are going to be deceived
[40:50] because we are going to look for
[40:52] something else other than the promise
[40:54] for this hour if we cannot recognize the
[40:57] form that god has chose to come in in
[40:59] this day
[41:00] is his word
[41:04] you may want it to be a jesus coming on
[41:06] a cloud
[41:08] with nail scars in his hand or whatever
[41:10] form you may want it to be in you can
[41:12] want it to be whatever you want it to be
[41:14] in but you don't get to choose
[41:17] he said i'm coming in the form of my
[41:19] word and i'm going to reveal that
[41:21] through a son of man
[41:25] that's how i'm coming receive it or not
[41:29] that's how i'm coming
[41:31] and if we fail to recognize that and
[41:34] preach another coming of christ
[41:38] we by default have made ourselves
[41:39] anti-word and antichrist and we are not
[41:42] going to get anywhere with god
[41:44] we have got to accept god in the form
[41:46] that he wants to come in
[41:48] and that was the form of the fullness of
[41:50] his word as expressed through his
[41:51] prophet brother branham
[41:54] simple i know
[41:56] elementary some would say
[42:00] but i've i don't have to take anybody
[42:02] else's word for this i've seen this in
[42:04] my own lifetime what the deviation away
[42:06] from that produces
[42:08] and i'll tell you what it produces
[42:10] it produces a bunch of people on an
[42:12] altar
[42:14] over
[42:15] and over
[42:16] and over
[42:18] and over
[42:19] seeking something that's laying right in
[42:21] front of them
[42:24] and then by perchance they actually do
[42:26] get what they're after because i believe
[42:28] they're sincere in heart
[42:30] they will wonder
[42:32] and wonder and wonder and wonder if
[42:35] they've really got it
[42:37] that's what that doctrine produces
[42:41] but
[42:42] a doctrine of recognizing that my god
[42:46] my christ has came to me personally
[42:50] in the form of his word in the fullness
[42:52] of his word and i have accepted that as
[42:55] taught by my prophet messenger produces
[42:58] the exact opposite of that
[43:00] it produces a stability and established
[43:03] people who do not wonder if they're the
[43:05] bride of jesus christ or not they know
[43:08] that they know that they know who they
[43:11] are in so much that their outer realms
[43:14] can tell them every day you're not
[43:16] you're not you're not
[43:20] and that word on the inside will still
[43:21] declare i am i am i am
[43:26] that's what we're after saints that's
[43:29] rapturing faith that is a faith that you
[43:31] have been caught up into that will
[43:34] eventually catch your 16 elements up
[43:38] let's not be deceived
[43:42] let's not be deceived
[43:44] let's allow it to be as simple and as
[43:46] straightforward as it is
[43:52] brother and says when he was baptizing
[43:54] and jordan jordan speaking of john the
[43:56] word of god
[43:58] jesus
[44:00] just in case you were confused about who
[44:01] the word of god was
[44:03] came to him
[44:05] the word always comes to the truly
[44:08] spirit field
[44:10] so don't try to be spirit-filled without
[44:13] the word
[44:14] i know i'm beating this in but i'm going
[44:16] to beat it in i got a quote for that too
[44:19] brother braden says sometimes you preach
[44:21] so much to people about different things
[44:23] that people fail to get what point you
[44:24] is even making he says sometimes you
[44:26] just got to take one point and beat them
[44:28] with it something along those lines just
[44:29] hammer it in to make sure that they get
[44:31] it
[44:33] so sorry i'm thick headed so by default
[44:35] i automatically think everybody else is
[44:36] to get it
[44:38] the word always comes to the truly
[44:40] spirit field that is the evidence of
[44:44] being filled with the holy ghost
[44:46] did you notice that jesus said the world
[44:49] could not receive the holy ghost
[44:51] well in this verse i just read neither
[44:54] could they receive the word
[44:59] why
[45:01] because the word
[45:03] and the spirit
[45:04] are one
[45:07] i want you to note very carefully that
[45:09] jesus did not say that the evidence of
[45:11] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[45:12] speaking in tongues interpreting
[45:14] prophesying or shouting and dancing he
[45:17] said the evidence would be that you
[45:18] would be in the truth
[45:21] now again
[45:24] we can put a self-interpretation to what
[45:26] the truth is
[45:29] but we can't do that because he's
[45:31] already told us what the truth is
[45:35] the manifestation for this hour is
[45:37] christ in the form of his bride the
[45:40] fullness of the word in you
[45:46] he said the evidence would be that you
[45:48] would be in the truth
[45:51] you would be in the word of god for your
[45:54] age
[45:55] evidence has to do with receiving the
[45:59] word
[46:08] in corinthians first corinthians 14 37
[46:12] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[46:14] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[46:16] the things i have re that i have wrote
[46:18] unto you are the commandments of the
[46:20] lord
[46:20] now see that the proof of the indwelling
[46:23] spirit was to acknowledge
[46:26] and follow what god's prophet
[46:29] gave for his age
[46:31] as he set the church in order
[46:37] allow it to be as simple as he makes it
[46:43] paul had to say to those things who
[46:45] claimed another
[46:46] paul had to say to those who claimed
[46:48] another revelation
[46:50] what
[46:51] came the word of god out from you or
[46:53] came it unto you only the evidence of a
[46:56] spirit-filled christian believer is not
[46:59] to produce the truth or the word
[47:02] but to receive the truth
[47:04] or the word and to believe and obey it
[47:09] you say well where's brother branham
[47:11] getting all of this from what's he
[47:12] basing his doctrine on
[47:16] first peter 1 verse 22
[47:20] seeing you have purified your souls
[47:23] where are you born again at you're born
[47:24] again in your soul
[47:26] seeing that you have purified your souls
[47:29] in obeying the truth
[47:31] through the spirit
[47:33] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[47:36] see that ye love one another with a pure
[47:38] heart fervently
[47:40] being born again not of incorruptible
[47:43] seed but of incorruptible by the word of
[47:48] god
[47:50] which liveth and abideth forever
[47:53] so if you are here
[47:55] seeking the baptism of the holy spirit
[47:57] seeking the token seeking the new birth
[48:00] i would simply tell you seek the true
[48:03] word of god
[48:05] acknowledge it
[48:07] and follow it
[48:09] that is what the prophet taught us that
[48:11] is what the scripture teaches us the
[48:14] scripture does not teach us that we are
[48:16] saved or born again by any other
[48:19] experience
[48:21] the scripture teaches us we are born
[48:23] again by receiving the word of god
[48:31] 1965 christ is revealed in his own word
[48:34] brother branham says today
[48:37] so confused about the evidence of the
[48:39] holy ghost
[48:41] has anybody in their lifetime seen
[48:43] confusion about the evidence of the holy
[48:44] ghost
[48:47] okay like three of you have
[48:51] so confused about the evidence of the
[48:54] holy ghost and so forth
[48:56] satan can impersonate any kind of gift
[48:59] that god has got
[49:01] what's he linking to that confusion
[49:04] gifts
[49:06] gifts and manifestations is what brings
[49:08] that confusion
[49:10] satan can impersonate any kind of a gift
[49:12] that god has got but he cannot bring
[49:15] that word
[49:16] word by word
[49:19] so now he exposes what the confusion is
[49:23] and he tells us how to fix the confusion
[49:25] if you're confused about the evidence of
[49:27] the holy ghost it's possibly because
[49:29] you've seen some type of manifestation
[49:31] of a gift and you thought that was it
[49:34] other than it simply being the word
[49:38] upon word
[49:39] upon word in your life
[49:43] so if you want to do away with the
[49:44] confusion just get back to the word
[49:48] the word for your hour
[49:50] the fullness of the word
[49:52] displayed in the individual
[49:55] that's where he failed in the garden
[49:58] that's where he always failed that's
[50:00] where them tapes on the false anointed
[50:02] ones
[50:04] see where he's going
[50:07] that's where them that tape on the false
[50:09] anointed ones or anointed ones they can
[50:11] be anointed with the spirit
[50:14] speak in tongues dance shout preach the
[50:16] gospel
[50:18] and still a devil
[50:21] he said it not me
[50:24] he's not pulling any punches now
[50:28] preach the gospel
[50:31] and still be a devil what gospel are
[50:33] they preaching they can't be preaching
[50:34] the full word of god or they wouldn't be
[50:36] a devil
[50:37] they're preaching a slight deviation and
[50:39] i'm making the new birth something that
[50:41] it's not
[50:43] calling jesus on the scene he says we
[50:45] need a book of acts again
[50:47] but the only way you'll do it is to get
[50:50] back to the
[50:52] bible many wants a book of acts
[50:56] how many wants manifestations and gifts
[51:00] and a book of acts
[51:03] he says the only way you'll produce that
[51:05] is if you get back to the bible if you
[51:06] get back to the word
[51:08] see i fear sometimes that we're seeking
[51:11] things that are not evil that are not
[51:13] sinful they're actually of god and
[51:14] worthy of seeking
[51:17] but we're seeking the wrong thing in the
[51:19] wrong way
[51:21] we're seeking to produce something
[51:23] ourselves we're seeking a manifestation
[51:26] to produce within ourselves instead of
[51:28] seeking the word and allowing it to
[51:30] produce something so we're trying to get
[51:33] the cart before the horse
[51:36] he says get back to the bible and away
[51:39] from some of this hybrid religion
[51:42] you're a christian because you are born
[51:45] in the spirit of christ and the word of
[51:48] god lives in you
[51:52] i fear that that definition of the book
[51:54] of acts would differ from some of the
[51:57] definitions of the book of acts that
[51:59] i've heard taught
[52:01] because he's saying you want to get back
[52:03] to a book of acts we need a book of acts
[52:06] and then he says you're a christian
[52:08] because you're born of the spirit of god
[52:10] and the word of god lives in you
[52:13] see there's lots of things that go on in
[52:15] the book of acts and a lot of them are
[52:17] very dynamic
[52:19] and don't think for a second that i
[52:20] don't want those
[52:23] i want them i want them all i want more
[52:25] of them
[52:27] but what i don't want is all of them and
[52:29] miss the word of god living in me
[52:35] that is the main point of the book of
[52:37] acts remember the book of acts is based
[52:40] upon what peter had to say when he came
[52:42] out of the upper room and what peter had
[52:44] to say is this word of god right here
[52:47] is what you're seeing right here this
[52:49] word of god that you see in job that's
[52:51] what you're seeing right here
[52:54] that's the book of acts now as that
[52:56] progressed there was multitudes of
[52:58] manifestations from that
[53:01] but if they ever deviated away from the
[53:04] point of being able to say this right
[53:06] here that you see
[53:07] is this right here
[53:10] they've missed the book of
[53:12] acts here we are 2 000 years later and
[53:15] we can do the exact same thing
[53:23] spoken word is the original seed
[53:25] brother chad read this on wednesday but
[53:28] he was
[53:29] laying emphasis on another part which
[53:32] i'm glad because now i can read it and
[53:34] lay emphasis on another part
[53:36] says the only way we can ever be born
[53:39] again is first in the womb of the mind
[53:42] received the word
[53:44] he was speaking on keeping your
[53:46] the womb of your mind clear
[53:48] but i'm focusing on the principle of the
[53:51] new birth it says the only way that we
[53:53] can ever be born again is first in the
[53:56] womb of the mind received the word
[54:05] why
[54:06] have we tried every other way then
[54:10] and again i don't have to take your word
[54:12] for it saints i've seen this in my own
[54:14] lifetime
[54:16] and i don't like it
[54:18] i don't like it
[54:19] i don't like young people sincerely
[54:21] sinking something or old people for that
[54:24] matter sincerely sinking something and a
[54:26] false gospel being given to them
[54:29] why have we tried to reproduce the new
[54:32] birth some other way than what he told
[54:34] us to do
[54:36] if you want to be born again first in
[54:39] the womb of your mind receive the
[54:41] message of your hour
[54:45] don't seek another experience
[54:48] receiving the word of god for your age
[54:51] in the womb of your mind and having it
[54:53] go into your soul will produce any
[54:56] experience you're in need of
[55:01] you may act a thousand different ways
[55:04] and i don't care about how you act
[55:06] i'm concerned that you've had that
[55:08] experience of receiving the word of god
[55:10] in the womb of your mind and allowing it
[55:12] to drop into your soul
[55:14] that is the book of acts that will
[55:17] produce any experience and any
[55:19] manifestation and any gift that you have
[55:21] need of
[55:23] but we have tried to produce
[55:26] the holy spirit and the new birth
[55:29] however many ways
[55:31] outside of that
[55:33] outside of preaching the pure word of
[55:35] god
[55:35] as it was delivered to us
[55:41] he says first receive it in the mind
[55:44] receive the word and then the spirit
[55:48] comes on top of that and brings it to
[55:50] life
[55:51] so if you're seeking the holy spirit i
[55:53] would ask you to examine what the holy
[55:57] spirit comes upon
[56:00] what channel is it going to come to you
[56:04] as i said before what is the spirit
[56:07] riding on
[56:10] the spirit of god the spirit of jesus
[56:14] christ only rides on one power
[56:18] and that is the word for your age
[56:22] if you're after the spirit of god in
[56:24] your life
[56:25] find the word of god for your age
[56:28] you'll receive it
[56:31] no way that it will fail
[56:34] there you are see that's what does it
[56:37] that's the real gospel teaching
[56:42] brother i believe if saint paul was
[56:44] standing today he'd teach the same thing
[56:47] i do in this hour
[56:50] what would he teach oh you all are
[56:51] wanting the baptism of the holy spirit
[56:53] receive the word for your hour
[56:56] he says that's the real gospel teaching
[57:00] again by default
[57:03] anything that's not that
[57:04] is the wrong gospel teaching
[57:09] the real gospel teaching of the baptism
[57:12] of the holy spirit
[57:15] is to receive the word for your hour and
[57:17] you can never receive the word for your
[57:19] hour if you do not first recognize who
[57:20] that word came through
[57:23] it's that simple praise god let's go to
[57:25] the book of revelation
[57:29] let's go to revelation chapter 4.
[57:33] we're going to
[57:35] nail this down if we haven't already
[57:38] and if i have already nailed it down
[57:40] then i'm going to clench it
[57:42] and if i've already clinched it then i'm
[57:44] going to nail the board nail the nail
[57:46] all the way through the board
[57:52] remember what we're after saints we're
[57:54] after
[57:55] a settled people
[57:57] brother branham says the spirit of
[57:59] teaching comes into the church
[58:01] to settle the church to establish the
[58:04] church
[58:07] let's allow him to settle us to
[58:10] establish us
[58:11] so
[58:12] how many would agree that brother
[58:14] branham taught john represents the bride
[58:17] how many would agree that john had a
[58:20] journey through the book of revelation
[58:23] how many would agree that we as an
[58:25] individual if we would do what john did
[58:27] in the book of revelation we would be
[58:29] manifesting the holy spirit in our life
[58:31] and for our age
[58:33] everybody with me so far
[58:36] let's take a scriptural identification
[58:40] of what we are to do as the bride of
[58:42] jesus christ demonstrating the fullness
[58:45] of the word in our age
[58:47] this is what the scripture says we will
[58:50] do
[58:53] john chapter 4 or i'm sorry revelation
[58:55] chapter 4.
[58:58] john
[59:00] meets an angel
[59:02] in the beginning of this book and this
[59:04] angel tells him to do certain things
[59:08] my other
[59:10] pre-qualification question is how many
[59:12] believes if we would do what the angel
[59:14] told john to do in the book of
[59:15] revelation we would be okay
[59:18] if we will do what the angel told john
[59:20] to do
[59:21] we'll be okay
[59:24] but he meets this angel in the beginning
[59:25] of the book of revelation and this angel
[59:27] tells him to do certain things
[59:30] and only certain things he doesn't tell
[59:32] him just go do whatever you want he
[59:34] doesn't leave things up to question or
[59:36] interpretation he's very specific he
[59:38] tells john to do certain things
[59:41] john is the type of the bride so now
[59:43] this angel is telling us as the bride to
[59:45] do certain things
[59:46] john chapter 4 verse 1 says after this i
[59:49] looked and behold a door was opened in
[59:50] heaven and the first voice which i heard
[59:53] as it were a trumpet talking with me
[59:54] which said come up hither
[59:58] this is your first
[1:00:00] instruction from your angel
[1:00:05] doesn't say go seek something
[1:00:07] it doesn't say go pray and fast it
[1:00:10] doesn't say go to the altar it doesn't
[1:00:12] say weep and cry it says come
[1:00:15] up here
[1:00:19] brother branham says if we're going to
[1:00:21] do anything in the spirit of god we must
[1:00:23] first get in the spirit of god if we're
[1:00:26] going to understand anything
[1:00:28] we must first get in the spirit
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:32] it should not be shocking that the first
[1:00:33] instructions that he comes and gives to
[1:00:35] his bride is
[1:00:36] get up here
[1:00:39] get up out of laodicea
[1:00:41] get up out brother branham says this is
[1:00:43] the scene-changing chapter he says in
[1:00:45] chapter four that the scene changes from
[1:00:48] earth and carnal things to heavenly
[1:00:50] spiritual things
[1:00:51] if you're going to get anywhere with god
[1:00:53] you have got to get out of your carnal
[1:00:55] understanding and your carnal sight and
[1:00:57] get into the spirit
[1:00:59] now this is where the trick lays because
[1:01:01] you can get into a spirit and be wrong
[1:01:04] but you have to get into the spirit and
[1:01:06] the only way that you're going to know
[1:01:08] that you've got into the correct spirit
[1:01:10] as it's if it is identified by your
[1:01:12] messenger
[1:01:15] so before you can hear the call
[1:01:17] to come up hither and go up hither to
[1:01:21] the proper place you first have to
[1:01:23] recognize who the angel is in chapter
[1:01:25] one
[1:01:26] in the beginning of the book
[1:01:28] remember
[1:01:29] john says this voice was behind him
[1:01:35] but he knew who the voice was which
[1:01:38] means he had already met the voice
[1:01:42] we've got to meet the voice we have
[1:01:45] to have an understanding who this is
[1:01:47] speaking to us but once we have that
[1:01:49] understanding and once we once we have
[1:01:51] that proper placement
[1:01:53] who this is
[1:01:55] now we can now we can have a liberty to
[1:01:57] do whatever he says
[1:01:59] because i'll just be quite frank with
[1:02:01] you once i've recognized who this angel
[1:02:03] is i don't care what he tells me to do
[1:02:04] i'm going to do it
[1:02:05] if he says as the old saying is go jump
[1:02:07] off a bridge i'm going to go jump off
[1:02:08] the bridge
[1:02:09] jump off a cliff i'm jumping off a cliff
[1:02:12] if he tells me to read and pray my
[1:02:14] reading
[1:02:15] uh read my bible and pray every day i
[1:02:17] might read and pray every day
[1:02:20] how dynamic is that
[1:02:23] once he tells me
[1:02:26] once i have the revelation of who this
[1:02:28] is
[1:02:29] i'm going to do what he says
[1:02:31] even if he says well just in my opinion
[1:02:33] i would do this
[1:02:35] it's good enough for me
[1:02:38] remember this is not just any angel
[1:02:40] saints
[1:02:41] this is the angel that god said
[1:02:44] i'm going to send you my angel
[1:02:50] i find it laughable
[1:02:53] and insulting
[1:02:55] when god's angel
[1:02:56] would come in his own humility and say
[1:02:59] well this is just my opinion and then we
[1:03:02] would just
[1:03:03] discount that like it's just a man's
[1:03:05] opinion
[1:03:07] it shows that we have no understanding
[1:03:11] of who this is
[1:03:13] this is god's angel that he sent
[1:03:20] what weight should we give to the mere
[1:03:23] opinion of god's angel that he would
[1:03:26] send to us
[1:03:28] i find it preposterous that we think we
[1:03:31] would have a better idea than that
[1:03:37] let's not be childish let's not be silly
[1:03:42] i think god
[1:03:44] that he sent me his angel
[1:03:47] that if nothing else he could just tell
[1:03:49] me his opinion of what he thinks god
[1:03:51] likes
[1:03:52] and how i should approach god
[1:03:54] and what he thinks
[1:03:57] god would be pleased in
[1:03:59] and that i don't have
[1:04:01] remember you only have two options you
[1:04:02] either take his opinion or you take your
[1:04:04] own opinion
[1:04:09] i i
[1:04:10] worry sometimes that we we don't
[1:04:13] acknowledge
[1:04:15] you know what that means when we say
[1:04:17] things like that
[1:04:19] the first instruction
[1:04:22] scripturally speaking
[1:04:24] that the angel gives us
[1:04:27] is come up here
[1:04:29] get out of the carnal get out of the
[1:04:30] natural
[1:04:31] come up here you can write these down if
[1:04:34] you want to
[1:04:36] i feel this is very important and i feel
[1:04:38] that if you will go back to this in
[1:04:41] times of unsettledness it'll be a
[1:04:42] comfort to you
[1:04:45] remember we're just going to target
[1:04:47] i'm just going to do what the angel told
[1:04:50] me to do
[1:04:51] because if we do that
[1:04:53] when we get to the end of this
[1:04:55] we you understand what i'm saying this
[1:04:57] and i say this respectfully we have an
[1:04:59] argument with god
[1:05:01] like if we get to the end of this and he
[1:05:03] cast us into outer darkness and we've
[1:05:05] done everything the angel told us to do
[1:05:08] god is a just god
[1:05:10] like i i feel that is the one and only
[1:05:13] argument we might have
[1:05:15] obviously if we do what he told us to do
[1:05:17] we're not going to be in that position
[1:05:18] but i'm just making that as a picture
[1:05:24] if we will just do what he told us to do
[1:05:26] because remember god is the one who
[1:05:28] vindicated this angel
[1:05:30] and if god so thoroughly vindicated this
[1:05:33] angel as he did to deceive me into doing
[1:05:36] something wrong i don't stand a chance
[1:05:37] saints because i'm just being honest
[1:05:39] with you i have no capability not to be
[1:05:42] deceived by this vindication that he
[1:05:43] provided i am totally and utterly
[1:05:46] deceived by it i have totally and
[1:05:48] utterly sold out to it i am either
[1:05:50] completely right or i am completely
[1:05:52] wrong
[1:05:56] he's the one who vindicated him
[1:06:00] the first instruction that he gives
[1:06:01] chapter 4.
[1:06:04] come up here into the spiritual realm
[1:06:06] let's go to chapter five
[1:06:09] chapter five verse five
[1:06:11] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:06:15] quit your crime
[1:06:20] i've already told you to get your eyes
[1:06:21] off of carnal things and get into the
[1:06:23] spirit
[1:06:24] why are you crying
[1:06:27] quit your whining
[1:06:28] i am the lamb slain before the
[1:06:30] foundation of the world and i have
[1:06:32] chosen you i've predestinated you i have
[1:06:34] sent you mine angel i have given you my
[1:06:36] full word
[1:06:38] quit crying because you don't know how
[1:06:39] you're going to pay your bills this week
[1:06:42] quit crying that your flesh is
[1:06:44] sick quit crying that you've got a
[1:06:47] problem
[1:06:48] weep not john
[1:06:50] weep not my bride
[1:06:54] quit going back into carnal things
[1:06:57] i've already told you come up hither
[1:07:01] a fruit of coming up hither is you're
[1:07:03] going to quit your whining
[1:07:06] that i'm going to quit my whining
[1:07:11] these are the instructions that john
[1:07:13] received
[1:07:15] come up hither
[1:07:17] quit your crime
[1:07:20] chapter 6
[1:07:23] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:07:25] the seals and i heard as it were a noise
[1:07:27] of a thunder one of the four beasts sane
[1:07:29] come
[1:07:30] and see
[1:07:34] come up hither
[1:07:37] quit your crying
[1:07:39] come and see
[1:07:43] now
[1:07:43] compare this
[1:07:47] to what we read at the beginning
[1:07:49] in john 16
[1:07:52] of what he
[1:07:54] the spirit of truth is to do
[1:07:58] i have yet many things to say unto you
[1:08:01] but ye cannot bear them now
[1:08:04] why
[1:08:05] because you have not come up hither
[1:08:08] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[1:08:10] come he will guide you into all truth
[1:08:13] for he shall not speak of himself but
[1:08:15] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:08:18] speak and he will show you things to
[1:08:19] come
[1:08:21] what is this spirit here in chapter 6
[1:08:23] doing now
[1:08:25] come and see
[1:08:27] come and see
[1:08:28] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[1:08:30] of mine and will show unto you
[1:08:40] but when the comforter is come
[1:08:44] whom i shall send unto you from the
[1:08:47] father
[1:08:48] even the spirit of truth with which
[1:08:50] proceedeth from the father he shall
[1:08:52] testify of me
[1:08:54] the comforter
[1:08:55] what does a comforter do
[1:08:58] tells you to quit crying
[1:09:03] who do you think this is operating
[1:09:05] through the book of revelation talking
[1:09:07] to his bride
[1:09:09] he's doing the exact same things that
[1:09:13] jesus said
[1:09:14] the comforter and the spirit of truth
[1:09:18] also known as the holy ghost would do
[1:09:20] when he came
[1:09:24] chapter six he tells john come and see
[1:09:28] he tells them come and see come and see
[1:09:29] and another beast come and another one
[1:09:31] come and the voice speaks out of the
[1:09:32] myth says come and see come and see what
[1:09:35] chapter 6 is breaking to the seals he's
[1:09:37] revealing the tactics of the enemy
[1:09:40] come and see the tactics of the enemy
[1:09:43] so number one
[1:09:45] get out of the carnal into the spiritual
[1:09:47] quit your crying over carnal things
[1:09:50] i'm the lamb i've taken care of it now
[1:09:53] come and see the tactics of the enemy
[1:09:59] he proceeds through chapter six
[1:10:03] revealing the tactics
[1:10:06] it goes to chapter 10
[1:10:08] probably our favorite chapter no doubt
[1:10:10] very familiar
[1:10:13] chapter 10
[1:10:15] he says eat the book
[1:10:19] remember these are the specific
[1:10:21] instructions from god
[1:10:23] through his angel to you
[1:10:26] eat the book
[1:10:30] eat
[1:10:31] the book
[1:10:34] verse 8
[1:10:35] then he goes to verse 11.
[1:10:38] say what the book said
[1:10:40] prophesy again
[1:10:42] eat the book and then say what the book
[1:10:45] said
[1:10:47] and if you have to use words
[1:10:51] eat the book
[1:10:52] manifest the book
[1:10:55] live the book
[1:10:56] prophesy again
[1:11:00] goes to chapter 11
[1:11:02] verse 1 and there was given me a read
[1:11:04] like unto a rod and the angel stood
[1:11:06] saying
[1:11:07] rise
[1:11:08] and measure the temple of god
[1:11:11] and the altar in them that worship
[1:11:12] therein
[1:11:13] he tells him
[1:11:15] stand up
[1:11:17] take what i have given you
[1:11:20] a rod
[1:11:21] remember who carries a rod a shepherd
[1:11:24] carries a rod and what is the rod
[1:11:28] it's a comfort to us
[1:11:30] is that not what david said
[1:11:32] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:11:36] he says take what i have given you and
[1:11:39] measure the temple of god he's not
[1:11:41] talking about a building
[1:11:43] what is the temple of god you are the
[1:11:45] temple of god
[1:11:47] so he says get up
[1:11:49] take the word i've given you and measure
[1:11:51] yourself
[1:11:54] if you're measuring up to the word of
[1:11:56] god
[1:11:56] these are your instructions
[1:12:00] but he goes a little bit farther because
[1:12:01] he says but the court the court
[1:12:04] which is without the temple leave out
[1:12:06] and measure it not
[1:12:11] anything that's not dealing with you
[1:12:14] don't worry about measuring it
[1:12:16] you don't need to worry and figure out
[1:12:18] who the foolish virgin is
[1:12:21] you don't need to figure out who judas
[1:12:23] is
[1:12:24] he says take the word that i've given
[1:12:26] you measure yourself the rest of it
[1:12:28] don't worry about it
[1:12:31] i'll deal with that i know the
[1:12:33] measurements of that
[1:12:35] you come up hither
[1:12:37] quit crying
[1:12:39] look at the tactics of the evil one
[1:12:42] take the word that i've given you and
[1:12:44] measure yourself
[1:12:47] and don't worry about anybody else
[1:12:51] chapter 17
[1:12:58] verse 1
[1:13:00] and there came one of the seven angels
[1:13:02] which one that was you know
[1:13:04] i have my ideas
[1:13:07] which had the seven vials and talked
[1:13:09] with me saying come hither
[1:13:12] i will show thee the judgment of the
[1:13:14] great that sitteth upon many
[1:13:16] waters
[1:13:19] come hither
[1:13:21] i'm going to show you what happens
[1:13:24] when somebody does not take what i've
[1:13:26] given them
[1:13:28] measure up to it and examine themselves
[1:13:31] this is the judgment
[1:13:35] this is what's going to happen to them
[1:13:37] when they fail to recognize the tactics
[1:13:39] of them of the enemy
[1:13:41] this is what route they go down
[1:13:46] chapter 21
[1:13:51] verse 9.
[1:13:55] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:13:56] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:13:58] the seven last plagues and talked with
[1:14:00] me saying
[1:14:01] come hither
[1:14:03] i will show thee the bride the lamb's
[1:14:06] wife
[1:14:08] come hither so that i can give you a
[1:14:10] proper understanding of who you are
[1:14:13] based upon the fact
[1:14:15] that you have left carnal things
[1:14:17] came into a heavenly realm
[1:14:21] that you have
[1:14:22] quit
[1:14:24] quit weeping about carnal things
[1:14:27] that you have a proper understanding
[1:14:29] of the
[1:14:30] of the enemy's tactics
[1:14:32] that you have measured yourself
[1:14:35] and measured up to the word of god
[1:14:37] and i've shown you the judgment of those
[1:14:39] that don't do that
[1:14:40] now because you've done this come here
[1:14:43] i'm going to give you a proper
[1:14:45] understanding of who you are
[1:14:47] i am going to show you you are my bride
[1:14:53] chapter 22
[1:14:55] verse 9
[1:14:57] the last thing that the angel says to
[1:14:58] him
[1:15:00] then saith he unto me
[1:15:02] let's go up to verse 8. and i john saw
[1:15:05] these things and heard them and when i
[1:15:07] heard and seen i fell down to worship
[1:15:09] before the feet of the angel which
[1:15:10] showed me these things
[1:15:12] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[1:15:15] for i am thy fellow servant of the and
[1:15:17] of thy brethren and of the prophets and
[1:15:20] them which keep the sayings of this book
[1:15:22] worship god
[1:15:25] the last thing that this angel says to
[1:15:27] john is don't worship me
[1:15:31] i'm simply a son of man revealing the
[1:15:33] son of man
[1:15:36] i am simply a vessel that the holy
[1:15:38] spirit is working through
[1:15:40] don't worship the 16 elements that is
[1:15:43] here
[1:15:44] worship god
[1:15:54] you can see
[1:15:57] why
[1:15:59] that there would be
[1:16:02] an intuition to worship this vessel
[1:16:07] brother bryan says it's a honed razor's
[1:16:09] edge
[1:16:12] they asked him the question you know
[1:16:14] brother branham these people are saying
[1:16:15] you're jesus christ and
[1:16:16] so forth he says
[1:16:19] you know in one sense of the word
[1:16:21] they're a million miles off
[1:16:22] but in another sense of the word
[1:16:24] they're real close to it
[1:16:28] the 16 elements
[1:16:30] that made up the body of brother branham
[1:16:32] i do not worship
[1:16:36] but
[1:16:37] what was represented there
[1:16:39] and what was waived before me
[1:16:41] i have no issue saying i worship that
[1:16:45] remember worship is to bow yourself down
[1:16:49] before
[1:16:51] and i bow myself down to that word that
[1:16:53] was represented in that wave sheath
[1:16:56] even
[1:16:57] the times that the wave sheath
[1:17:00] demonstrated repentance
[1:17:03] i have no issue with that
[1:17:05] that is my absolute
[1:17:07] and that is my wave sheep that is my
[1:17:09] representation and the word that that
[1:17:13] vessel
[1:17:14] demonstrated i worship
[1:17:17] but the 16 elements that carried that i
[1:17:20] do not
[1:17:23] you say well that's split in hairs it is
[1:17:26] i would even say so much it's splitting
[1:17:28] atoms
[1:17:31] i cannot properly reveal that to you
[1:17:33] saints only god can
[1:17:36] some of you may walk out here and say
[1:17:37] that i worship him and i think he's
[1:17:38] deity i do not
[1:17:40] but i think he's everything
[1:17:42] but and i believe what was represented
[1:17:45] there and what was before us was deity
[1:17:48] nothing less
[1:17:51] it was the fullness of the word in a
[1:17:53] hybrid body
[1:17:54] and i worship
[1:17:57] and yield and give myself to the
[1:17:59] fullness of that word
[1:18:00] without worshiping that hybrid body
[1:18:05] i found it unique
[1:18:07] in this scripture here
[1:18:10] that he simply told john don't do that
[1:18:14] he didn't rebuke him and chastise him
[1:18:16] like what are you doing how in the world
[1:18:18] did you get to that point
[1:18:20] like
[1:18:20] you are totally out in left field
[1:18:23] no he just simply says john
[1:18:25] john
[1:18:26] no
[1:18:27] not me
[1:18:28] worship god
[1:18:34] i have a lot of grace for the people
[1:18:36] that walked in the days of brother
[1:18:37] branham that get confused about whether
[1:18:38] he was god or not
[1:18:40] because i'm just being honest with you
[1:18:41] saints if i was there and i was that
[1:18:43] close to and i've seen the things that
[1:18:44] they've seen i'm not sure which side of
[1:18:46] the fence i would be on
[1:18:48] if it's not by a supernatural revelation
[1:18:51] from god you will never be able to
[1:18:53] discern the two
[1:18:55] it is that close it is literally the
[1:18:58] fullness of god himself being manifested
[1:19:01] in a hybrid vessel
[1:19:04] and if he wouldn't come and declare to
[1:19:06] us that he was a hybrid vessel
[1:19:09] i can very easily see how someone would
[1:19:11] get confused i've got grace for that i'm
[1:19:14] not saying the right i'm not saying that
[1:19:16] they need to repent i'm not saying they
[1:19:17] don't need to repent and make that right
[1:19:19] and come to a proper understanding
[1:19:21] i'm just saying i'm going to do what the
[1:19:22] angel did i'm not going to rebuke them
[1:19:24] and i'm not going to chastise them and
[1:19:25] i'm not going to call them stupid and
[1:19:27] call them foolish virgin and call them
[1:19:28] heretics
[1:19:30] i'm just going to say no
[1:19:32] let's stick with what he taught us
[1:19:34] don't do that don't do that don't
[1:19:36] worship him
[1:19:38] worship god
[1:19:41] and i'll be shocked if the argument that
[1:19:42] they present back is not well god is the
[1:19:45] word and the word is what's being
[1:19:46] manifested here and i'll say you're
[1:19:47] right
[1:19:49] you're right
[1:19:51] but it's the word in fallen flesh so we
[1:19:53] cannot worship the flesh
[1:19:55] only the holy spirit can give you a
[1:19:57] proper understanding of that
[1:20:00] now after an hour i finally got to where
[1:20:03] i wanted to get to
[1:20:06] and that's where i finished up last time
[1:20:07] i read this quote out of the church age
[1:20:08] book if you allow me the courtesy just
[1:20:10] to go through this and make a couple
[1:20:12] points we'll close i'm not going to be
[1:20:14] able to finish i didn't expect to
[1:20:16] but this is what was really striking me
[1:20:19] so heavily during wednesday
[1:20:22] and it was where i had finished last
[1:20:24] time brother branham says if we are
[1:20:26] going to live as christians
[1:20:29] we have to be in his spirit
[1:20:32] if there is anything good that will come
[1:20:34] to me it has to be one revealed by the
[1:20:37] spirit
[1:20:38] two confirmed by the word
[1:20:41] and three made manifest by the results
[1:20:44] that it bears now i read that quote last
[1:20:46] time but i want to expound upon that
[1:20:49] he says as surely as john needed to be
[1:20:51] in the spirit to receive these
[1:20:52] tremendous revelations fresh from jesus
[1:20:55] we need to be in the spirit to
[1:20:56] understand the revelations that god has
[1:20:58] given to us to live by his word for it
[1:21:01] is the same spirit
[1:21:06] remember the three things that he said
[1:21:07] if there is anything good
[1:21:10] to come to me to you from god it has to
[1:21:14] meet three qualifications
[1:21:16] it has to be revealed by god's spirit
[1:21:19] it has to be confirmed by god's word and
[1:21:22] it has to be made it has to be made
[1:21:24] manifest in your life and proven by the
[1:21:27] results that it bears that's how we know
[1:21:30] it's from god
[1:21:34] but this leaves us in a conundrum
[1:21:37] because
[1:21:38] what can you
[1:21:40] or i
[1:21:42] do to start this process moving
[1:21:46] remember the process is something has to
[1:21:48] be revealed by the spirit
[1:21:51] then confirmed by the word then made
[1:21:53] manifest in your life
[1:21:54] so do you want the full word of god
[1:21:56] manifest in your life
[1:21:58] do you want everything that you do to be
[1:22:00] confirmed by the word
[1:22:02] those two can only happen if it's first
[1:22:03] revealed to you by the spirit
[1:22:06] now i want somebody to come up here and
[1:22:08] tell me the secret to making the spirit
[1:22:10] reveal something to you
[1:22:16] you and i have no capacity
[1:22:19] whatsoever in any figment of our
[1:22:21] imagination to make god do anything for
[1:22:24] us
[1:22:26] we have no capacity to make this process
[1:22:31] start
[1:22:32] so we can't get to the end of it which
[1:22:35] is our desire
[1:22:37] it's my desire i want the fullness of
[1:22:39] the word made manifest in my life
[1:22:41] but according to the prophet the only
[1:22:43] way that process can take place is if
[1:22:46] first the spirit comes and reveals
[1:22:49] something to me
[1:22:52] but i have no capability to make the
[1:22:54] spirit do that
[1:22:56] it doesn't say if you pray for three
[1:22:58] days or if you fast for a week or if you
[1:23:00] sell all your lands and all your it
[1:23:03] doesn't give me any qualifications for
[1:23:05] this
[1:23:08] if it did i would do it and i have no
[1:23:11] doubt that if it did as crazy and as
[1:23:13] ludicrous as it would be we would all do
[1:23:15] it
[1:23:17] we would do it is that our is that not
[1:23:20] our hearts cry and our hearts prayer
[1:23:22] every day lord just show me what you
[1:23:23] want me to do
[1:23:25] i'll do it i don't care what it is if
[1:23:27] you'll just show me i'll do it
[1:23:34] but we have no
[1:23:37] requirements
[1:23:39] from the angel to make this process
[1:23:41] start working
[1:23:43] because the angel knows
[1:23:45] there are no requirements
[1:23:47] because if there were requirements it
[1:23:50] would completely do away with the grace
[1:23:51] of god to you and me
[1:23:57] think about it
[1:24:00] if there was a list of 27
[1:24:03] requirements
[1:24:05] and we went and did all of them
[1:24:09] it does away with the grace of god
[1:24:10] because now it's requirements that we
[1:24:12] can read and we can do
[1:24:14] and now anybody can make their way in
[1:24:16] because there's a list of requirements
[1:24:20] and also
[1:24:23] it would make our salvation based upon
[1:24:25] works
[1:24:26] of our own doing
[1:24:28] i saw this list i chose to do it and i
[1:24:30] did it
[1:24:32] now god you're obligated to do this
[1:24:36] i know this is so simple and this is so
[1:24:38] elementary
[1:24:40] but if we'll really grasp this principle
[1:24:43] it will bring a settledness to us
[1:24:45] face the fact that if god don't do
[1:24:48] something for you you're lost
[1:24:55] there is nothing you can do work wise
[1:24:58] prayer wise obedience wise
[1:25:01] fasting wise
[1:25:03] to make god move on your behalf
[1:25:06] so quit relax quit worrying about it
[1:25:09] relax
[1:25:13] it doesn't do you any good to get all
[1:25:16] worked up
[1:25:18] in your spirit realm about this because
[1:25:20] at the end of the day there's nothing
[1:25:22] you can do about it to begin with
[1:25:25] so if the devil is coming and an evil
[1:25:27] spirit maybe a mockery holy spirit would
[1:25:30] come to you and tell you if you would
[1:25:31] just do this more if you were a better
[1:25:33] boy if you hadn't done that three days
[1:25:35] ago or if you wouldn't have looked at
[1:25:36] that woman at walmart cross side like
[1:25:37] you did and said
[1:25:39] then maybe god would move on your behalf
[1:25:41] no
[1:25:44] it doesn't matter how good you are
[1:25:51] i can't even believe i'm saying this
[1:25:57] i'm supposed to tell you to repent or
[1:25:58] perish
[1:26:02] it doesn't matter saints
[1:26:05] it does not matter how good you are
[1:26:07] there is no capability that you have
[1:26:10] within yourself to pull the spirit down
[1:26:12] and reveal something to you
[1:26:14] and just in case you think i was making
[1:26:16] this up let me read you a quote
[1:26:19] 1962 communion brother branham says if
[1:26:22] god ever sends his power to his church
[1:26:25] it'll be by his grace it won't be the
[1:26:28] obedience of the people
[1:26:36] see you can do everything right
[1:26:40] and god's still not obligated to move on
[1:26:42] your behalf
[1:26:44] in isaiah in the 40th chapter it says
[1:26:47] how to cry to jerus jerusalem that her
[1:26:50] warfare was over yet she was guilty of
[1:26:53] idolatry but it was god's grace that was
[1:26:56] sending it god sends anything to us
[1:27:00] it'll be his grace and not our merits
[1:27:06] so when the evil spirit comes by telling
[1:27:08] you to have more merits
[1:27:10] or to do more good works or to do
[1:27:13] something
[1:27:15] to get the spirit to move in your life
[1:27:19] you should be able to now recognize that
[1:27:21] automatically as an evil spirit
[1:27:27] now a spirit that comes to you and tells
[1:27:29] you to line up with the word of god is
[1:27:31] not an evil spirit but a spirit that
[1:27:33] comes to you and tells you to line up
[1:27:35] with the word of god so that the spirit
[1:27:36] will move in your life is an evil spirit
[1:27:41] because it's taking the proper
[1:27:44] application and telling you you're going
[1:27:46] to get something that is outside of the
[1:27:49] grace of god
[1:27:51] we should obey the word of god
[1:27:55] we should pray we should fast we should
[1:27:58] do all of those things we should try to
[1:28:00] be a good boy
[1:28:04] with the understanding that if god
[1:28:07] doesn't do something in his grace for me
[1:28:09] i'm still
[1:28:11] lost amen
[1:28:16] if there is anything good to come to me
[1:28:18] by god it has to first be revealed by
[1:28:21] the spirit and if it doesn't there's no
[1:28:23] way we can confirm it by the word and
[1:28:25] there's no way it's going to manifest
[1:28:26] itself in our life
[1:28:28] we are at the total mercy of god himself
[1:28:33] to come and pick us up
[1:28:36] that is why
[1:28:37] in john in revelation chapter 4 the
[1:28:40] first thing that he says
[1:28:42] is come here
[1:28:48] come here
[1:28:50] without an invitation to come into the
[1:28:52] heavenly realm you can't come into the
[1:28:54] heavenly realm
[1:28:56] with an invitation you may go boldly
[1:29:02] if god ever sends his power to the
[1:29:04] church
[1:29:05] it'll be his grace it won't be the
[1:29:07] obedience of the people
[1:29:11] if god sends anything to us it'll be his
[1:29:14] grace and not our merits
[1:29:20] musicians if you'll come
[1:29:24] you say well that sounds good i like
[1:29:26] that
[1:29:29] there's a catch
[1:29:38] it has to be revealed by the spirit
[1:29:41] second it has to be confirmed by the
[1:29:43] word
[1:29:45] thirdly
[1:29:46] it has to be manifest in our lives
[1:29:49] to prove that it's the true word of god
[1:29:52] but we have no capability
[1:29:56] focus now
[1:29:57] because we have no capability to make
[1:29:59] the spirit move
[1:30:03] but brother branham goes farther in the
[1:30:04] church age book and he makes a comment
[1:30:08] we have more wealth
[1:30:10] than we have ever had
[1:30:12] and yet less is being accomplished
[1:30:15] spiritually
[1:30:16] it is not with money that god works with
[1:30:20] he moves by his spirit
[1:30:23] that's what we're after right because
[1:30:25] remember that's what starts the process
[1:30:26] rolling
[1:30:29] he moves by his spirit
[1:30:32] and that moving of the spirit
[1:30:36] comes only
[1:30:38] to a life
[1:30:39] consecrated to the word
[1:30:48] no true believer is any stronger and
[1:30:52] spiritually healthy and alive
[1:30:55] than his knowledge of
[1:30:58] and adherence to
[1:31:00] the pure
[1:31:01] word of god
[1:31:05] so is it by grace
[1:31:07] that the spirit has to move in our lives
[1:31:10] absolutely
[1:31:12] no issues there
[1:31:15] but
[1:31:17] in order to even stand a chance
[1:31:20] for this spirit to move in our life
[1:31:24] the prophet said that that spirit will
[1:31:26] only move
[1:31:28] in a life
[1:31:29] that is consecrated
[1:31:31] to the word of god
[1:31:34] this is why wednesday struck me so
[1:31:36] profoundly because i knew the direction
[1:31:38] that i was going next time i ministered
[1:31:39] i didn't know it was going to be today
[1:31:40] but i knew whenever it was
[1:31:44] and he's ministering
[1:31:46] on the key to making the spirit move
[1:31:51] he wasn't just talking about your phone
[1:31:52] saints
[1:31:57] the spirit
[1:32:00] the capability for us to come to the
[1:32:03] fullness of the word in our vessels
[1:32:06] the process
[1:32:08] for that is for the spirit to reveal
[1:32:10] something to us confirm it into its word
[1:32:12] and then manifest it in us
[1:32:15] remember that's the end-all be-all like
[1:32:18] when we come to the fullness of the word
[1:32:19] and our vessels we're out of here
[1:32:23] but the process for that has to start
[1:32:25] with the moving of the spirit
[1:32:28] and we can't do anything to force that
[1:32:30] spirit to move but in order to even
[1:32:33] stand a chance for it to move in for it
[1:32:35] to begin that process we have to keep
[1:32:38] ourself consecrated to the word of god
[1:32:44] the spirit
[1:32:45] moves
[1:32:46] only in a life consecrated to the word
[1:32:52] and we cannot do that if we're
[1:32:54] distracted by everything else
[1:32:58] as he said not sinful things we're
[1:33:00] beyond that saints i feel we're beyond
[1:33:02] that
[1:33:03] that's not the tactics the devil is
[1:33:04] going to use
[1:33:06] the devil is going to use righteous
[1:33:08] things
[1:33:09] to get us distracted and get us to
[1:33:11] deviate our lives
[1:33:14] away from being solely consecrated to
[1:33:17] the word
[1:33:20] now there is the possibility
[1:33:25] there is the possibility
[1:33:30] that you
[1:33:31] can totally
[1:33:32] consecrate yourself
[1:33:35] to the word
[1:33:37] as best as you know how
[1:33:39] even obedience to the word as best as
[1:33:41] you know how
[1:33:43] and the spirit will not move in your
[1:33:45] life and reveal anything to you
[1:33:47] there is that possibility because we
[1:33:50] cannot force god to do anything
[1:33:54] but the point is if you have a desire
[1:33:56] for that to be in your life remember the
[1:33:58] principle our prophet taught us before
[1:34:01] that desire can be there
[1:34:03] god made a way for that desire
[1:34:06] so if we have that desire
[1:34:08] and we know the only way that we can
[1:34:12] even stand a chance for that desire to
[1:34:14] manifest itself in our life
[1:34:16] is to keep ourselves solely and
[1:34:19] singularly focused and consecrated to
[1:34:22] the pure word of god and obedience to it
[1:34:26] why would we not want to do that
[1:34:32] and i would say it may sound hard
[1:34:36] but i would say if we are declaring
[1:34:39] that the only thing that we want out of
[1:34:41] life
[1:34:43] is for the fullness of the word to be
[1:34:44] made manifest in our vessels
[1:34:47] the last
[1:34:48] phase of that process
[1:34:51] but yet we are not solely and totally
[1:34:54] consecrated
[1:34:55] to the word of god in our daily lives
[1:34:59] we're not telling the truth
[1:35:03] because remember the last phase is the
[1:35:05] manifestation in our life
[1:35:08] and you can scream and shout and cry all
[1:35:10] you want that you want that
[1:35:11] manifestation in your life
[1:35:13] but if you and i
[1:35:15] are not going to do
[1:35:17] the first thing and the only thing that
[1:35:19] we can do to even stand a chance to get
[1:35:21] to that point
[1:35:23] we're preaching another gospel
[1:35:26] we're not being honest with ourselves
[1:35:28] and we're not being honest with the
[1:35:29] truth
[1:35:34] the capacity
[1:35:36] to keep our spirit realm clear from
[1:35:39] carnal earthly distractions is the first
[1:35:42] thing we must do to further the plan of
[1:35:45] god
[1:35:46] it is so simple it is so elementary it
[1:35:49] is so basic
[1:35:51] the scripture calls it that's your
[1:35:53] reasonable
[1:35:54] service but it is the hardest thing that
[1:35:57] me and you fight on a daily basis i'm
[1:35:59] not preaching at you now i'm preaching
[1:36:01] with you i'm preaching to myself
[1:36:03] it's the same battle i fight saints
[1:36:05] don't think i don't have a million and
[1:36:07] one things to
[1:36:08] do don't i understand you have a million
[1:36:11] and one things to do
[1:36:13] i'm not saying you're not busy
[1:36:15] i'm not saying i'm not busy
[1:36:18] i'm not trying to make this life
[1:36:19] something that it's not
[1:36:21] i'm just saying at some point in time
[1:36:23] we've got to come to realization to quit
[1:36:24] making excuses and realize if we want
[1:36:26] the spirit of god to move the only thing
[1:36:29] that i can do
[1:36:30] is consecrate myself solely and
[1:36:33] singularly to the word of god
[1:36:37] and then i can expect him to reveal
[1:36:39] something to me
[1:36:41] then i can expect to confirm that in his
[1:36:43] word and then i can expect him to
[1:36:46] manifest that and prove that in my life
[1:36:49] let's stand together
[1:36:51] that is the only thing that we can do
[1:36:54] that is the only possibility that we
[1:36:57] have to further the kingdom of god
[1:37:00] that is the working of the holy spirit
[1:37:07] so we're seeking the holy spirit
[1:37:10] we're seeking the new birth we're
[1:37:11] seeking the token
[1:37:13] but now we have an understanding of what
[1:37:15] it is and what it will do
[1:37:17] because i assure you a mockery holy
[1:37:19] spirit will do a lot of things but the
[1:37:21] one thing that it won't do is consecrate
[1:37:23] your daily life to the word of god only
[1:37:27] by perchance
[1:37:28] god might want to reveal something to
[1:37:30] you
[1:37:32] and i'll just drop this in on a personal
[1:37:34] note you take it for what it's worth
[1:37:37] but i'm going to ask you to try
[1:37:38] something and if it don't work you throw
[1:37:40] it in a garbage can
[1:37:43] but as you're pursuing and seeking and
[1:37:46] concentrating yourself daily to the word
[1:37:48] of god
[1:37:50] asking god to reveal something to you in
[1:37:52] the spirit to confirm by his word and
[1:37:54] make manifest in your life
[1:37:56] don't ask in and of for yourself
[1:38:00] ask for your brothers and your sisters
[1:38:05] can god reveal something to you to help
[1:38:07] you absolutely
[1:38:10] but we're done with one man ministries
[1:38:13] we are in a day in an age that the bride
[1:38:16] is to be the final voice to the final
[1:38:17] age
[1:38:19] we are in the day in an age to where god
[1:38:22] is wanting to pick up
[1:38:25] you
[1:38:26] the bride
[1:38:27] and speak the words of life
[1:38:30] to somebody else the bride
[1:38:33] that is the voice he's wanting to use
[1:38:36] we have the pure word of god as
[1:38:38] delivered to us by our prophet
[1:38:41] but there are specific daily instances
[1:38:45] of what we need to do in our lives what
[1:38:48] i would say carnal things
[1:38:50] job situations family situations
[1:38:53] decisions that have to be made
[1:38:56] health decisions
[1:38:59] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:39:01] there's specific things that we can't go
[1:39:03] read and find a quote that says
[1:39:06] on
[1:39:07] monday the 15th or whatever it is 16th
[1:39:10] you need to do this you need to make
[1:39:12] this decision about this situation
[1:39:15] but that's why there is a final voice to
[1:39:17] a final age on earth now
[1:39:19] that god is wanting to move through
[1:39:22] and that's just a challenge to you
[1:39:25] when you're seeking seek for yourself
[1:39:27] i'm not telling you not to i'm greedy
[1:39:29] when it comes to the things of god and
[1:39:30] i'm going to seek for myself
[1:39:33] but at the end of that
[1:39:35] i'm going to spend time seeking
[1:39:38] as i'm consecrating myself to the word
[1:39:41] of god and the spirit of god on a daily
[1:39:44] basis for the spirit to move and reveal
[1:39:47] something to me i want to designate a
[1:39:50] time period that he can speak to me
[1:39:53] about a situation that will help my
[1:39:55] brother and sister that won't even help
[1:39:57] me at all
[1:39:59] that may actually be a burden to me
[1:40:04] but i'll ask you if god is wanting to
[1:40:06] personally and specifically speak to an
[1:40:09] individual
[1:40:10] what voice is he going to use in this
[1:40:12] day and age
[1:40:14] he can use any voice
[1:40:17] i've seen him do it in my own life i've
[1:40:19] had
[1:40:20] sinner people
[1:40:21] blatant center people
[1:40:23] say something to me to prick my heart
[1:40:25] god can do whatever he wants to do
[1:40:28] and he will do what he needs to do
[1:40:33] i'm just saying if we want to farther
[1:40:35] the program of god and be operating in
[1:40:38] the spirit
[1:40:40] should not we allow god
[1:40:43] and if we really believe that we are the
[1:40:46] voice to the final age and we are the
[1:40:47] vessels that he's moving through
[1:40:50] should we not designate ourself
[1:40:54] a time period that maybe god wants to
[1:40:56] use me to speak to my brother and sister
[1:40:59] i challenge you to do that
[1:41:02] i ask you to do that
[1:41:05] if we want to see god move in our midst
[1:41:08] we have to come the way god wants to
[1:41:09] move
[1:41:11] and god may do it
[1:41:13] you may see dynamics like you have never
[1:41:16] seen before there may be prophecies
[1:41:20] there may be healings
[1:41:22] there may be gifts rise up like we have
[1:41:24] never seen
[1:41:25] it may be so dynamic it will blow your
[1:41:27] mind
[1:41:29] there is the possibility though it will
[1:41:31] be so dynamic
[1:41:34] that it will be as simple as you are
[1:41:36] simply anointed to read something out of
[1:41:37] the message and your brother asks you a
[1:41:39] question about it the next day
[1:41:44] so let's not self-interpret what dynamic
[1:41:46] is
[1:41:48] let's allow him to express himself as
[1:41:50] dynamic as he wants to express himself
[1:41:53] and remember
[1:41:55] no true believer if you'll play
[1:41:57] something softly please
[1:41:59] i promise i'm closing
[1:42:00] no true believer
[1:42:02] is any stronger
[1:42:05] spiritually healthy
[1:42:07] and alive
[1:42:08] than his knowledge of
[1:42:12] you're not going to get the knowledge if
[1:42:14] you don't eat the book
[1:42:17] don't expect to have the knowledge of
[1:42:19] god if you don't read the message in the
[1:42:21] bible
[1:42:22] and don't expect to be
[1:42:24] strong
[1:42:25] spiritually healthy and alive if you
[1:42:28] don't eat the book
[1:42:30] don't expect it you're not going to be
[1:42:36] and alive then his knowledge of
[1:42:38] and adherence to
[1:42:40] the pure word of god
[1:42:42] so
[1:42:43] do not expect to be strong
[1:42:46] spiritually healthy or alive if you
[1:42:48] don't eat the book
[1:42:49] and then do what the book says
[1:42:53] and don't expect to have a proper
[1:42:56] understanding of what that book is
[1:42:58] trying to tell you if you have not kept
[1:43:01] your mind free from carnal things
[1:43:04] and came up hither
[1:43:06] and have dedicated and consecrated
[1:43:08] yourself solely to the word of god
[1:43:11] that's the only chance we have saints
[1:43:14] and even then it's not a guarantee
[1:43:17] but that's the only chance we have to
[1:43:20] make the holy spirit move
[1:43:22] do we have an understanding i'm going to
[1:43:24] stop let's pray
[1:43:26] precious lord jesus we thank you for
[1:43:28] this
[1:43:29] time that you've allowed us to be
[1:43:30] together lord
[1:43:32] and father i've been
[1:43:34] lengthy and i've repeated myself a lot
[1:43:37] lord
[1:43:38] but i prayed that you would just take
[1:43:41] this burden that i have and this
[1:43:43] direction that i feel to go
[1:43:47] and that you would reveal it to the
[1:43:48] people lord
[1:43:50] lord that the purpose of this being
[1:43:53] ministered would come to fruition and
[1:43:56] that purpose would be
[1:43:58] individuals
[1:43:59] and a group of believers that are
[1:44:02] steadfast and solid and stabilized on
[1:44:06] who we are
[1:44:08] and what our purpose is
[1:44:11] lord that we would not be tossed to and
[1:44:13] fro
[1:44:14] and wonder whether we're going to make
[1:44:16] it or if we're going to make it but that
[1:44:19] we would come to a proper understanding
[1:44:21] that we've already made it
[1:44:23] lord and that you would build upon that
[1:44:25] revelation from glory to glory to glory
[1:44:29] but lord if we have not first answered
[1:44:31] that question
[1:44:33] we can build as high as we want and it's
[1:44:34] going to come crumbling down
[1:44:36] but father i pray as we have went back
[1:44:39] to a scriptural
[1:44:42] teaching
[1:44:45] of this baptism of your spirit of this
[1:44:48] new birth as brought to us by your
[1:44:50] prophet as we have went back to that and
[1:44:54] and focused on that
[1:44:56] may we relax and allow it to be
[1:44:59] as he taught it to his father and may we
[1:45:02] move forward with boldness lord may we
[1:45:05] recognize our position in christ may we
[1:45:07] do as the angel told john and come and
[1:45:10] see the tactics of the imminent enemy
[1:45:12] may we
[1:45:14] may we take the rod of this word and
[1:45:17] measure ourself individually to make
[1:45:20] sure that we are meeting and matching
[1:45:22] that word
[1:45:24] we just consecrate ourselves to you lord
[1:45:26] we give you our this day
[1:45:28] we pray that you would be with the
[1:45:30] remainder of this service as we would
[1:45:31] worship you father in song and praise
[1:45:34] may you just move upon our hearts lord
[1:45:36] and establish an unsettledness and lord
[1:45:39] if there would be any here
[1:45:41] who have not had that experience of the
[1:45:43] new birth
[1:45:44] who have not completely died out to
[1:45:46] themselves and given over to your word
[1:45:48] and your spirit i pray that they would
[1:45:49] do so now
[1:45:51] lord and if those
[1:45:52] if there are those here that are
[1:45:54] confused and not recognize what they
[1:45:57] have done and what they have received
[1:46:00] may you settle that in their hearts here
[1:46:02] this morning
[1:46:04] may we go forth
[1:46:06] as your bride
[1:46:07] with our heads held high lord not in
[1:46:10] arrogance lord but in boldness knowing
[1:46:13] who we are and where we stand and may we
[1:46:15] do as you told us in chapter 10 prophesy
[1:46:18] again lord that another might be saved
[1:46:20] that another eagle out there somewhere
[1:46:22] lord would be able to come to their
[1:46:24] position
[1:46:25] and to recognize who they are
[1:46:27] we just give you this day lord we would
[1:46:29] pray for the kids service this afternoon
[1:46:31] we pray that your anointing would be
[1:46:33] there and be supernatural or that you
[1:46:34] would just move on our youth lord reveal
[1:46:37] yourself to them father we just commit
[1:46:39] all to you in the name of the lord jesus
[1:46:41] christ the bride says
[1:46:43] amen god bless you saints thank you for
[1:46:46] bearing with me let's sing brother ben

[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:50] amen
[1:47:51] i tell you friends we're all in the same
[1:47:53] spot
[1:47:55] whether you've been serving god for a
[1:47:56] month
[1:47:57] or you've been serving god for 30 years
[1:48:00] you still need god to reveal the next
[1:48:02] steps
[1:48:04] amen
[1:48:05] all that god has done for us in the past
[1:48:07] and the many things and experiences we
[1:48:08] had is just encouragement lessons we've
[1:48:11] learned to carry us into the next step
[1:48:13] but without him where do we go
[1:48:16] without him where we place our foot
[1:48:18] without him which direction we take
[1:48:20] when it comes to the end of it brother
[1:48:22] branham was so good at doing this he put
[1:48:24] us all in the same place
[1:48:26] we're all children of god and we need to
[1:48:28] be led by the spirit of god
[1:48:31] and how do we do that
[1:48:32] we now learn we know the only thing that
[1:48:35] i can do is consecrate myself to this
[1:48:37] word and trust that he'll do the rest
[1:48:41] i can't make him move but i trust he
[1:48:43] will
[1:48:44] he told me in his word he would i
[1:48:45] believe he will all i can do is what
[1:48:48] he's asked me to do is believe him
[1:48:51] act on his word obey it stand on it have
[1:48:54] trust and faith that god will lead
[1:48:57] he's done it this far
[1:48:59] why would he stop now
[1:49:01] amen
[1:49:02] whether you preach the gospel
[1:49:05] whether you're a teenager
[1:49:07] whether you have an office in the church
[1:49:08] you don't we're all in the same place
[1:49:11] we're utterly dependent on god to reveal
[1:49:14] to us from the spirit what we should do
[1:49:17] and i say what a place to be
[1:49:19] utterly completely dependent on him
[1:49:23] amen god is good
[1:49:25] let's pray for one another that god will
[1:49:27] continue to keep us
[1:49:29] in his hand and lead us step by step
[1:49:32] i appreciate the instruction we got i
[1:49:35] appreciate the subtleness that comes
[1:49:36] from just taking god at his word and
[1:49:38] believing that if he said it it's the
[1:49:40] truth i can rest my soul upon it
[1:49:43] i don't need what somebody else told me
[1:49:45] i don't need what somebody else has
[1:49:46] encouraged me to do or say or experience
[1:49:49] to have if i can see it in the word the
[1:49:51] prophet showed it to us in the word we
[1:49:53] can see in the scriptures i can rest my
[1:49:55] soul on that word
[1:49:57] and have rest and we can never move
[1:49:59] forward into the program of god until we
[1:50:01] first take him out of his word and
[1:50:03] believe it if we're are we always going
[1:50:05] around the same starting line and never
[1:50:07] getting down the road amen
[1:50:09] what a trick the devil has pulled on us
[1:50:12] let's take him at his word
[1:50:14] and say god i believe you now lead me
[1:50:17] i believe you'll do what you said you
[1:50:18] will do i take your word i believe god
