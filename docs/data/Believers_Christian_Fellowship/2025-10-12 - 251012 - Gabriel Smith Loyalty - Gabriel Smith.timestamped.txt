[11:21] and uh greet you in the name of the

[11:25] I uh
[11:27] uh want to send greetings from uh pastor
[11:32] uh he called me on the way here and uh
[11:36] so um he sends his love and greetings
[11:39] and uh looking forward to him coming
[11:42] back. He said he'd be here about Tuesday
[11:44] evening.
[11:45] And so, uh, anybody might have been
[11:48] catching the services.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been blessed and, uh, thought
[11:54] they were awesome so far. And, um,
[11:58] uh, I I got a
[12:02] I wouldn't say it's kind of along the
[12:04] same lines, but, I guess it is, cuz the
[12:06] open book's the open book. Amen.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I, uh, I was, I was happy
[12:16] to, uh, hear some of the things that he
[12:18] was saying. Always makes me feel good,
[12:21] uh, cuz that means we're getting our
[12:23] inspiration from headquarters.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, happy about that. So, um, if
[12:30] we could, we'll just get right into the
[12:32] scripture,
[12:34] uh, this morning. Um, I'd like to I'd
[12:38] like to read out of Ruth chapter 1.
[12:43] Thank you, musicians.
[12:45] And, uh, just like to thank this extra
[12:49] special thank you for Brother Franco.
[12:52] Uh,
[12:54] oh my, where would I be without brother
[12:56] Franco?
[12:58] He's awesome. And so uh
[13:02] uh I I I changed my font on my
[13:05] PowerPoint and then I got here and it
[13:08] was all jumbled up and
[13:10] I spelled my title wrong on the
[13:12] PowerPoint slide and
[13:15] boy I tell you and we need to give
[13:18] Brother Franco like a a big F like you
[13:20] know Super Franco and
[13:25] get him a red cape and everything here.
[13:32] Certainly uh appreciate him and you know
[13:35] he always does it with a smile. That's
[13:37] that's what I love about brother Franco.
[13:39] He he's awesome. So the book of Ruth uh
[13:43] the first chapter verse 14. And they
[13:47] lifted up their voice, and wept again,
[13:48] and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law, but
[13:50] Ruth clave unto her. And she said,
[13:53] Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back
[13:56] unto her people, and unto her gods.
[13:59] Return thou after thy sister-in-law. And
[14:02] Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee,
[14:04] nor to return from following after thee.
[14:07] For whether thou goest, I will go, and
[14:10] where thou lodest, I will lodge. Thy
[14:14] people shall be my people, and thy God
[14:18] my God. Where thou diest will I die, and
[14:23] there will I be buried, the Lord do so
[14:27] to me, and more also if thou art but
[14:30] death part thee and me. When she saw
[14:34] that she was steadfastly minded to go
[14:36] with her, then she left speaking unto
[14:39] her. So they went
[14:41] unto until they came to Bethlehem. And
[14:44] it came to pass when they were come to
[14:46] Bethlehem that all the city was moved
[14:48] about them. And they said, "Is this
[14:51] Naomi?"
[14:52] And she said unto thee unto them, "Call
[14:55] me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the
[14:59] Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with
[15:02] me.
[15:04] I went out fool, and the Lord hath
[15:06] brought me home again empty.
[15:09] Why then call you me Naomi, seeing the
[15:13] Lord hath testified against me, and the
[15:16] Almighty hath afflicted me?" So Naomi
[15:19] returned in Ruth of Moabitis, her
[15:22] daughter-in-law, with her, which
[15:24] returned out of the country of Moab. And
[15:27] they came to Bethlehem in the beginning
[15:30] of the barley harvest.
[15:32] Uh I'd like to speak to you by the help
[15:35] of the Lord on loyalty.
[15:39] Let's bow our heads.
[15:42] Heavenly Father, truly we love you.
[15:48] today and grateful to be called by your
[15:51] name, the name above every name. And we
[15:57] certainly want to make you feel welcome
[16:01] behind this pull pit, Lord, in each
[16:04] aisle way, wanting our spirits, Lord, to
[16:10] welcome you and that you would just have
[16:13] the preeminence that you would be at the
[16:16] forefront, Lord, and the very
[16:18] centerpiece of this service, the
[16:21] centerpiece of our hearts and lives,
[16:24] asking, Lord, your forgiveness. be upon
[16:26] us and help me, Lord, to just speak your
[16:33] word. I I don't know what your children
[16:37] need this morning, but I I know what's
[16:41] been on my heart and I just pray that
[16:43] something would be said to be a help.
[16:46] Asking Lord your blessings be upon
[16:48] brother Chad as he's laboring today,
[16:52] Lord. and the last service just asking
[16:55] your blessings would be upon him and you
[16:58] giving traveling mercies back home him
[17:01] and brother David Lord that they would
[17:02] just enjoy one another's company and
[17:06] fellowship and when the pressure's off
[17:08] they'd be able just to relax and we just
[17:12] ask Lord that you would help us this day
[17:15] to uh relax each one from me Lord on
[17:20] back that we could just enter in, Lord,
[17:24] to heavenly places and that you would
[17:27] just have the preeminence and we commit
[17:30] all we are into your hands and we ask
[17:32] these things to be so in Jesus lovely
[17:35] name.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated
[17:40] if you like.
[17:43] loyalty
[17:44] and uh you know um Ruth and you know
[17:51] this is nothing new. we we know what
[17:54] she's a reflection of. And what I what I
[17:58] love about um the the first chapter here
[18:02] is that
[18:04] she was a real expression of loyalty
[18:08] that you know because we can all claim
[18:11] to be loyal
[18:13] but really loyalty really shows when the
[18:16] chips are down.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:18] That's uh loyalty is is is
[18:22] really proven, not proclaimed.
[18:26] We can we can all talk to talk and I can
[18:29] even preach on loyalty, but really it's
[18:32] our lives that's going to testify if we
[18:34] have true loyalty or not.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; And uh loyalty is is the same whether we
[18:41] win or lose.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:44] And you know, it it's it's when the
[18:46] chips are down is when roy loyalty is
[18:48] truly tested, right? You know, we we got
[18:51] we got young brothers and sisters
[18:53] getting married and you know, you got
[18:56] the you got the uh uh honeymoon and
[19:01] everything's fine and dandy and right
[19:04] and y'all know what I'm talking about.
[19:07] But
[19:07] &gt;&gt; but then after a few days, maybe hours
[19:14] that honeymoon starts to wear off
[19:17] and and you you start catching things
[19:20] that maybe you didn't realize that they
[19:22] were doing
[19:24] &gt;&gt; and and and and they start rubbing you
[19:26] the wrong way.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Right. It's okay. You blink this twice
[19:32] if you want to say amen.
[19:36] [Laughter]
[19:39] And so, but but it's when things go bad.
[19:43] It's when we, you know, we can we can
[19:46] have a marriage certificate on the wall
[19:49] and and to prove that we're legally
[19:51] married, but it's when things start
[19:54] getting rough and and the lightning
[19:57] flashes and the thunder rolls, that's
[20:00] when uh our loyalty is truly tested.
[20:04] and and and I believe that Ruth is an
[20:08] example of this last day bride that when
[20:11] things are at its lowest uh that's when
[20:14] true loyalty is tested and proven
[20:17] &gt;&gt; and and so um you know cuz when you
[20:20] think about mo when you think about uh
[20:23] Ruth being a Moabitete you know uh uh
[20:28] she said that wherever you go I'm going
[20:31] to go and and and whoever your God is
[20:34] and I might that's who my God is going
[20:36] to be. And you know, I I I think Ruth
[20:39] had uh excuse me, Naomi had such a
[20:42] testimony because uh as the prophet
[20:45] taught us that when when she had left uh
[20:48] the promised land, she was backslid
[20:51] and and even though Naomi was in that
[20:54] backsliding condition because she wasn't
[20:57] in her promised land, she still had such
[21:00] a testimony that it had an impact upon
[21:03] Ruth.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and to me, that's so profound
[21:07] that that when she would look at Naomi
[21:10] at her lowest, she would still see
[21:12] something that rang true.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; And and you know, uh because even in
[21:17] this message, there's always going to be
[21:19] highs and lows. You know, it's one thing
[21:22] when when a preacher preaches a message
[21:24] that you love and wow, it's it's fiery
[21:28] or there was such revelation rolling,
[21:30] but but wait till that minister hits a
[21:33] dry spell.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Then
[21:39] where's your loyalty going to be?
[21:43] you know, um, and Ruth, you know, she
[21:48] had a lot of obstacles and a lot of
[21:50] hurdles because the the, you know,
[21:53] remember that Moabites were frowned upon
[21:57] in the promised land.
[22:00] And the the the Bible tells us in
[22:03] Deuteronomy 23:3, "An Ammonite or a
[22:06] Moabitete shall not enter the
[22:09] congregation of the Lord, even to their
[22:12] 10th generation shall they not enter
[22:14] into the congregation of the Lord
[22:17] forever."
[22:19] &gt;&gt; So many times we'll we'll look at an
[22:22] illegitimate and we we we we want to
[22:24] look at that. But there was no grace for
[22:27] a Moabitete.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? After 10 generations, then
[22:32] that illegitimacy could be purged from
[22:34] the from the family lineage. But being a
[22:37] Moabitete, it was nothing.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Forever is forever.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; But but but Ruth could look at that and
[22:46] somehow say, "Your God is going to be my
[22:50] God."
[22:52] &gt;&gt; But she could look at her lineage and
[22:53] know where she come from.
[22:56] But she could still see something true.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; And and to me, it's so profound for her
[23:04] to have the the the the scripture
[23:07] stacked against her,
[23:09] &gt;&gt; but yet she would still be a reflection
[23:12] of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:20] And Naomi though she felt that she was
[23:23] in bitterness cuz that's what Mara
[23:25] means. It mean bought the bitterness.
[23:28] But Naomi Ruth wouldn't call her Mara
[23:32] but she would say my delight.
[23:36] And and I think sometimes it's, you
[23:39] know, when we're at our lowest that we
[23:42] can really shine the brightest.
[23:45] It's when it's the darkest of nights is
[23:48] really the opportunity for us to shine
[23:51] the brightest.
[23:53] Can we say amen to that?
[23:56] &gt;&gt; You know, uh
[23:59] Job would say,
[24:01] "Though he slay me,
[24:05] yet will I trust him."
[24:09] &gt;&gt; To me, that's true loyalty.
[24:12] that that he's not serving God so that
[24:15] he can be the elite of the elite.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; He's not serving God so that he can look
[24:21] down on his denominational brethren.
[24:24] That's right.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; And see that he has more than his
[24:27] coworker,
[24:29] &gt;&gt; that he has a greater light.
[24:32] But but whenever, you know, cuz slay
[24:34] means to murder.
[24:37] And so even though God would murder me,
[24:40] I'm still going to trust him.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; That's true loyalty.
[24:45] And brother Brandham says it takes a
[24:48] Gethsemane and a Calvary to make an
[24:51] Easter. It certainly did. How those
[24:54] apostles upon that morning when they
[24:57] were so discouraged until Peter said, "I
[25:00] am so discouraged. I believe I'll just
[25:02] go back fishing again. I'll go back. I
[25:05] I've seen him. They had great hopes and
[25:08] believed in everything until it come to
[25:11] that great darkening place. What was God
[25:14] doing? He was bringing those apostles to
[25:17] an ash sheep.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; He was bringing them to a place where
[25:24] they would have their faith confirmed
[25:28] to them.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, it's when things go
[25:33] backwards,
[25:34] that's our opportunity to see if we
[25:37] really got the goods.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Every everything is fine when revelation
[25:43] is flowing and and and we feel like
[25:45] we're 10t tall and bulletproof, but it's
[25:48] when we go through those dark times in
[25:50] life, when it seems like God steps back
[25:53] from us
[25:55] &gt;&gt; to see what we'll do.
[25:58] But if we would just take a moment and
[26:00] realize that he's doing that on purpose,
[26:05] not so much to confirm it to him
[26:08] because he knows the end from the
[26:10] beginning, but he's doing it so it'll
[26:13] confirm your faith
[26:15] &gt;&gt; to you.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; So that we'll realize that wait a
[26:21] minute, I am a true believer.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because when what is
[26:27] integrity? It's doing the right thing
[26:30] when nobody's watching.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; It's it's it integrity is when no when
[26:36] you're in another state or another
[26:39] country,
[26:41] &gt;&gt; right? And and nobody's watching you,
[26:45] but yet you still do the right thing.
[26:48] That's true loyalty.
[26:52] And you know, uh, I I I think of the
[26:55] Statcliffe family and that there was a
[26:58] family that Brother Brennham, uh, had
[27:02] found favor with. And they had they had
[27:06] uh lost a baby and they they reached out
[27:10] to the prophet and they had asked him,
[27:14] you know, if he'd he'd pray and they
[27:17] they were expecting a miracle.
[27:21] And brother Brandham, as faithful as he
[27:24] was, he he he didn't just uh go off
[27:28] willy-nilly, but he said, "Let me pray
[27:29] over it." And and I believe he prayed
[27:33] all night if I'm not mistaken this
[27:35] story. And
[27:37] you know the breaking of the day and God
[27:39] told him, he said, "Don't you put your
[27:42] hand on it."
[27:45] And the the family had laid the baby
[27:48] away and the doctors had it in wait and
[27:50] under an auctioned intent and they were
[27:52] going to send an airplane from Germany
[27:55] to to pack that prophet back to Germany
[27:57] and fly him there and fly him back and
[28:00] they had everything waiting. But God
[28:03] said no.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when God told that that that
[28:08] sister no and he said he said you know
[28:12] it's safe in the arms of God the
[28:14] Almighty. And she says something so
[28:18] profound. She said and and this is what
[28:20] I I I hope you can to me when I read
[28:23] this I can relate to it because she said
[28:25] she said what was it brother Brandham my
[28:28] weakness of faith.
[28:31] And just just in that statement,
[28:37] [Laughter]
[28:42] I saw y'all. Y'all weren't paying
[28:43] attention to me. Y'all was reading.
[28:46] [Laughter]
[28:50] But in that weakness of faith moment
[28:55] seemingly
[28:56] when when she and and what what's so
[28:59] profound to me is she didn't lash out at
[29:02] the Almighty
[29:04] &gt;&gt; and and that was proving her loyalty.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; But in her mind, she didn't even have a
[29:12] thought against God. But she was looking
[29:16] at herself
[29:18] &gt;&gt; going, "Lord, was it me?"
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Right? The same way we do as true
[29:24] believers, it's like, "God, did I do
[29:27] something wrong?" And that in itself
[29:31] proves who you are.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; And and so and so, Brother Brandham, he
[29:36] goes, she goes, "Brother Brandham, my
[29:38] weakness of faith, I said, you have
[29:42] great faith. You prayed for your baby.
[29:45] You and your husband held on to it. God
[29:48] raised that baby and he refused to do it
[29:52] because he knows what's best.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; See, and still you love him.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; That's real faith.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; When God can say no
[30:06] &gt;&gt; and his no is just as good
[30:10] &gt;&gt; as the yes that you wanted.
[30:15] I I'm so thankful brother Brandham says
[30:17] these things. He says, "And still you
[30:21] love him." That's real faith.
[30:25] For for the miracle not to happen
[30:29] because we we are so geared to want to
[30:33] see something.
[30:35] But God looks so much deeper.
[30:40] He says anybody when mountains are
[30:42] moving and things can have faith,
[30:45] but let it go backwards one time
[30:50] &gt;&gt; and see how it works. That's when you
[30:53] prove whether you got faith or not.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; It's when God tells us no.
[31:03] And the no can be just as rich and real
[31:07] to us as his yes that we wanted it to
[31:10] be.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; That's that's true loyalty.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; It's it's when we don't get what we
[31:22] want.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; And it's okay.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Because we ought to pray to change our
[31:31] will.
[31:33] This is the will that needs changing.
[31:36] Is my will, not God's will. Thy will be
[31:41] done
[31:42] &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; In order for us to be thankful that it
[31:48] his will is done on earth as it is in
[31:50] heaven, we have to be thinking of the
[31:53] heavenlies. And and as we go through
[31:56] this, I hope I hope our our I I I
[31:59] believe our brains need to be rewired.
[32:07] See, see Paul, Paul would say, "I thank
[32:11] Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled
[32:13] me, that he counted me faithful, putting
[32:15] me into the ministry, who was before a
[32:18] blasphemer, a persecutor, injurious, but
[32:21] I obtained mercy because I did it
[32:23] ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of
[32:25] our Lord was exceedingly abundant with
[32:28] faith and love which is in Christ
[32:30] Jesus." This is a faithful saying and
[32:32] worthy of all acceptation that Christ
[32:35] Jesus came into the world to save
[32:38] sinners of whom I am a chief. How be it
[32:41] for this cause I obtain mercy that in me
[32:45] first
[32:46] Christ Jesus Christ might show forth all
[32:49] look Paul was going to be a pattern of
[32:54] the longsuffering of God. a a man that
[32:57] would write a majority of this New
[32:59] Testament book.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; And God would see it so fitting to have
[33:05] him as a pattern so that when we wanted
[33:08] so that it would be so locked in that
[33:11] when you want to know what God's long
[33:13] suffering is, you could look at Paul and
[33:15] go, he's the pattern. So when you feel
[33:17] like you've ran out of all of God's
[33:19] longsuffering in your life, you need to
[33:22] go back to Paul
[33:24] &gt;&gt; because he's the pattern,
[33:27] &gt;&gt; right? And he says, "For a pattern to
[33:30] them which should hereafter believe on
[33:32] him to life everlasting." The man that
[33:35] had the coat that was that Stephen had
[33:39] been stoned by those group of men.
[33:43] And here he is.
[33:45] You know, Paul had a ministry of like 35
[33:50] years.
[33:53] And and from the time of that stoning of
[33:56] Stephen, it was it was going to be a
[34:00] pattern of the long suffering of God. He
[34:03] was going to beam an example. You think
[34:07] of of of
[34:10] everything that Paul had and that
[34:12] everything Paul gave away.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; You know, Paul was in remember because
[34:22] loyalty is losing
[34:26] and you're still just as faithful as if
[34:28] you won.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; It's when the chips are down,
[34:33] &gt;&gt; will you still serve him?
[34:37] It's when your prayer goes unanswered,
[34:41] will you still be loyal?
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Or will you hold a grudge?
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; And that's the mirror we have to look in
[34:52] and really be honest with ourselves
[34:55] because your loyalty will be tested.
[34:59] And when you when you look at Paul
[35:01] Paul's life, when when Paul was struck
[35:05] down on the road to to Damascus,
[35:09] he he he had in his heart that he would
[35:11] arrest every one of them nose noise
[35:14] makers down there. All of this divine
[35:17] healing will stop it. Put it in his
[35:18] pocket. He said, "I'm on my road down."
[35:21] And that day by about 11:00 of the day,
[35:23] a light shone in his face and he fell to
[35:25] the earth. Why? He was a predestinated
[35:28] seed. God said, "I have chosen him, yay,
[35:31] and I'm going to show him what great
[35:33] things he'll suffer for my name's sake."
[35:36] Watch what he says. I'll send him to the
[35:38] Gentiles and disgrace his name in every
[35:43] way.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; So, this was a Pharisee of the Pharisee.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; That would walk blameless. You couldn't
[35:54] touch his life.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; And here he is sacrificed all of that.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about loyalty? And what
[36:04] does God give him in return?
[36:08] &gt;&gt; He gives him disgrace.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; What?
[36:19] &gt;&gt; He knocks him off of his high horse.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Why? cuz he's cause because he's not
[36:25] elect.
[36:26] No,
[36:28] it's because he is elect.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; It's because he is a predestinated seed.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; And he knows he'll be loyal.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And so he's going to disgrace his name
[36:40] in every way.
[36:44] He's going to be mocked and made fun of
[36:47] and he's going to have to carry that in
[36:49] his heart.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; No doubt. has to think, God, why didn't
[36:53] you come to me
[36:56] a day earlier?
[36:59] Why didn't you come to me before I held
[37:01] the coats?
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You know, that haunted him his whole
[37:05] life.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; When when Stephen said, "Lord, lay not
[37:10] thy sin to their charge."
[37:16] When Paul
[37:18] is in a damp dark prison in AD67,
[37:24] 30 plus years
[37:27] afterwards,
[37:29] it still haunted him.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Was he forgiven?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; But the scar still
[37:41] remained.
[37:48] And when he's in a prison, think about
[37:51] this. When you read second Timothy, the
[37:54] prophet of God is not at a holiday in
[37:57] Express.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; He's not surrounded
[38:03] by all his congregation.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; He's not in a comfy three hots in a cop.
[38:11] There is no commissary.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Most y'all don't know what that is.
[38:16] Praise the Lord.
[38:22] Commissary when you go and you you you
[38:24] can get, you know, uh toothbrush and bag
[38:28] of ramen noodles and
[38:31] right meat sticks and cheese.
[38:36] Oh boy.
[38:40] But he's writing
[38:42] the eternal word of God
[38:46] &gt;&gt; in a dark, damp prison
[38:52] &gt;&gt; at the end of his life.
[38:56] And all he has
[38:58] no doubt rats and mice,
[39:02] spiders,
[39:07] and what he says
[39:09] when everybody at my first answer, no
[39:13] man stood with me. Think about this.
[39:17] He's pinning the books that we read.
[39:22] And as he's pinning this in pain,
[39:26] he says, "All men
[39:29] forsook me."
[39:32] The same way sometimes we can be sitting
[39:36] in the house of God or in a room full of
[39:40] people
[39:42] and we feel like we're all by
[39:46] &gt;&gt; ourselves. That's right.
[39:48] and nobody
[39:50] understands me.
[39:55] Job said, "My my my wife's breath is
[39:58] strange to me."
[40:01] You think you're the only one.
[40:07] And Satan will torment you and say,
[40:10] "See,
[40:12] you're not one of his.
[40:18] But your loyal heart,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; still beats
[40:24] true.
[40:30] He said, "All men forsook me,
[40:34] and I pray God."
[40:38] He says the exact same words
[40:42] that Stephen said 30 plus years ago.
[40:51] You ever been there?
[40:56] longsuffering.
[41:00] See, it's when people forsake you.
[41:04] We're not talking just about
[41:05] longsuffering
[41:07] for the grace that was given to him,
[41:10] but longsuffering has to be displayed
[41:15] &gt;&gt; in return.
[41:19] And when everything falls apart,
[41:23] I I it doesn't even I don't even think I
[41:26] can even I I try to wrap my mind around
[41:28] it that God would allow his prophet to
[41:31] be in a prison and he's and he's pinning
[41:37] the book of freedom.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; He's writing our pardon.
[41:49] in prison.
[41:51] See, God's that's why I say our our
[41:54] minds need to be rewired
[41:57] because we can have loyalty when it's
[42:00] baby blue skies and white puffy clouds.
[42:05] But true loyalty,
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[42:08] &gt;&gt; is when the lightning flashes
[42:10] &gt;&gt; and the thunder rolls. Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; It's It's when we're in that dark, damp,
[42:17] moldy prison house of our mind, sir.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; That's when loyalty
[42:29] shines
[42:31] &gt;&gt; the brightest.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Because when all men are forsaking him,
[42:37] he looks back to where he forsook
[42:40] Stephen. Yeah.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; See, it's it's it's
[42:49] when things when we when somebody wrongs
[42:51] us, you need to go back into your
[42:54] rolodex of life and look back where you
[42:57] wrong somebody else.
[43:02] That's when you need to go back to the
[43:05] sea of God's forgetfulness
[43:08] &gt;&gt; and go I
[43:09] &gt;&gt; That's right
[43:10] &gt;&gt; done it too.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; That That's what That's what Paul's
[43:14] doing. He's saying he said that it may
[43:17] not be laid to their charge.
[43:20] Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me
[43:24] and strengthened me. in the prison house
[43:27] when when everybody forsook him. That's
[43:32] when God was the closest to him.
[43:39] That by me the preaching might be fully
[43:42] known,
[43:44] good and bad, and that all the Gentiles
[43:48] might hear. And I was delivered out of
[43:51] the mouth of the lion. See, it's in
[43:54] those it's in those dark places the it's
[43:59] when it's the blackest and when it's the
[44:01] most troubling. It's it's when we go
[44:04] through it's when we go through look at
[44:06] the Lord Jesus when when he was you
[44:10] think about how perfect he was. Brother
[44:14] Brandham says no man never could
[44:16] describe what it was or ever will. There
[44:19] God placed all divine judgment upon him
[44:22] and smoteed him on the side. When out of
[44:24] his side came water and blood and spirit
[44:27] for redemption. How people paint his
[44:30] picture sometime with a robe around him
[44:32] or something another or a cross. That is
[44:34] not so. They des dispose that despise
[44:38] that man and bispose of every foul fog
[44:41] or thing they could. But he had to be
[44:44] there. He was the highest and loyalist
[44:48] of all the world. That's
[44:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; That ever was or will be.
[44:54] And in all of that loyalty,
[44:58] God put him on a cross.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; And forsook him.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:10] But it has to be that way.
[45:15] And sometimes
[45:18] sometimes we go through
[45:21] those times in life when it's the
[45:23] darkest
[45:25] and we feel like we're being the
[45:27] loyalist
[45:29] and things go south.
[45:36] But the price has to be paid.
[45:40] It must needs be that offenses will
[45:44] come.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; And who wants them?
[45:49] Nobody does.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; But it has to be this way.
[45:56] God designed it for every one of his
[45:59] children. And there is no exceptions.
[46:04] When when
[46:07] um
[46:11] brother Brandham says talking about
[46:13] Abraham, Abraham had double test. So he
[46:15] said,"Abraham, take thy son, thine only
[46:17] son, and take him to a certain mountain
[46:20] where I'm going to show you and then
[46:22] there sacrifice him." Now what Abraham
[46:25] would have took a second thought? How am
[46:27] I going to be father of nation where I'm
[46:29] this old and you're asking me to kill
[46:31] and destroy the only evidence that I'll
[46:33] have? You'll keep your word and make me
[46:34] a father of nation. How God loves to
[46:38] test his people. Every child that comes
[46:41] to God must be tested, child trained.
[46:47] No exceptions.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Everyone, and maybe tonight you're sick
[46:55] that you're sick. Just have a little
[46:56] child training, just a little testing.
[47:02] Don't be discouraged.
[47:07] God on the throne. He knows all things.
[47:12] If we're truly born of the spirit of
[47:13] God, everything's working together for
[47:15] our good. He's going to make everything
[47:18] right. He promised he would. He swore he
[47:21] would. And he's got to keep that word.
[47:23] He's kept it now for oh thousands of
[47:25] years to every believer. Would you be an
[47:29] exception?
[47:32] No sir, we're no exception. God is
[47:36] obligated to his word and he's obligated
[47:39] to his people.
[47:42] Listen what brother Brandham says. I
[47:44] imagine some of his enemies walk around
[47:46] say, "Father of nation, how many
[47:48] children do you have?
[47:51] Don't make any difference how I have
[47:54] now. I'm a father of nation. That's all.
[47:56] How do you know?" God said so that sell
[47:57] it. So along went Abraham. You see
[48:03] being so loyal,
[48:06] more loyal.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
[48:18] I think I think every one of us need to
[48:21] take that quote and put it on our
[48:23] refrigerator.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:30] Now, I want you to think of somebody
[48:32] that's loyal to you.
[48:36] Because remember, our brains are the
[48:39] ones that need rewired.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; And so Abraham, only a prophet could say
[48:46] this. So Abraham
[48:50] more loyal. Now, if somebody's loyal to
[48:53] you, what are you going to do to them?
[48:56] You're going to patty cake them around
[49:02] &gt;&gt; because why? You don't want to ruin that
[49:05] loyalty. That's
[49:06] &gt;&gt; right.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; You don't want to test
[49:11] &gt;&gt; that loyalty,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; because that would be cruel because
[49:17] they're so loyal to me,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:24] But that's not how God works.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; And that's not how God works with seed
[49:30] of Abraham.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Right, sir. Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Whom you are.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And so the more loyal you are,
[49:40] &gt;&gt; guess what? You get
[49:48] &gt;&gt; what
[49:51] the
[49:56] brother Gabe, can you read the next
[49:57] paragraph? Maybe
[50:04] by chance are you splicing tapes,
[50:06] brother?
[50:09] No. No,
[50:13] but remember, you are designed to be
[50:17] seed of Abraham.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; That's how God built you.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; And the more loyal you are
[50:28] is not the more cupcake road you're
[50:30] going to have. Amen.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; But more loyal, being so loyal, more
[50:38] loyal, more testing.
[50:41] So he brought him right back. Now
[50:43] remember, when God has counted you
[50:46] worthy, when you have a test, then he
[50:49] says, "Now don't fail this to get this.
[50:53] When you have a trial or a test, it
[50:56] shows the grace of God
[50:59] has found you." Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; You found favor.
[51:05] What?
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't that Isn't that contrary to our
[51:12] thinking?
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Because it's when the test comes
[51:19] and it gets real hard and dark, that's
[51:22] when we in our mind begin to question,
[51:26] God, where are you at?
[51:30] Brother Paul, you pray for me then.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; You pray for me, brother. Good.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "When the trial or test," he
[51:39] says, "you found favor with God and God
[51:42] believes that you'll stand the test.
[51:45] When looks like everything has gone
[51:47] wrong, God is giving you a trial.
[51:56] He's got confidence in you.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; He don't have to baby you around. You're
[52:03] not a hot blend praying a hybrid. You're
[52:06] a real Christian. God has given you a
[52:09] test. See what you'll do about it. No
[52:11] wonder Peter said these fiery trials why
[52:14] count it all joy. It's more precious to
[52:17] youth than gold.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And many times we hum and haw. Oh, well,
[52:24] if I just Well, that that's something
[52:26] God gave you to overcome. He knows
[52:29] you'll do it. He's put his trust in you.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; See, it it's it's
[52:38] when everything you you look at you look
[52:41] at Daniel in the lion's den, as faithful
[52:44] as he was, he didn't close the windows
[52:47] and hide, but he opened them up and he
[52:50] prayed unto the Lord. And what did God
[52:52] do to reward him?
[52:56] And we would think, well, that's not
[52:57] fair.
[52:59] Why did God allow that?
[53:02] But brother Brandham straightens it out
[53:04] for us.
[53:06] God was sealing his ministry
[53:09] with a change of the king's heart. that
[53:13] Darius sent to every language people
[53:15] across the world that every man should
[53:17] fear of the God of Daniel because he was
[53:20] a God that could deliver. Amen. So you
[53:23] see, it's at that time when men forsake
[53:26] men.
[53:29] It's when it's the darkest and it seems
[53:34] like it's the most confusing.
[53:37] God was sealing his ministry.
[53:41] God was crowning his ministry.
[53:44] But in order for for him to come to that
[53:47] breaking of the day, there had to come a
[53:50] lion's den.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; And we don't want the lion's den, but we
[53:55] want the breaking of the day.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; God's servants that stay true to the
[54:03] word that God seals their ministry with
[54:06] a crowning time.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:09] Did it look like a crowning time?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[54:15] The same way we have to tear down our
[54:18] imagery of what our crowning time is,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; because it may be a broken down body,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; but a heart of faith
[54:29] &gt;&gt; that still beats true.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[54:35] It may be a broken home and a broken
[54:38] family and a broken heart,
[54:44] but it's the fact that you get up and
[54:46] you dust yourself off and you conduct
[54:49] yourself with joy in the midst of the
[54:51] trials. That's the crowning of your
[54:55] ministry. Because every one of us have a
[54:59] ministry. And it's not just behind this
[55:01] pullpit. It's every day of our lives
[55:05] that we can conduct ourselves with joy
[55:08] in the midst of the trials. We can
[55:11] handle ourselves not as a slave but as a
[55:14] son or daughter of the king.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; You look at Jesus and and when he was
[55:19] getting ready to go to his road to
[55:21] Calvary, you know, brother Brandham
[55:23] tells us this. It's so profound. He says
[55:26] he asked for one thing in his prayer to
[55:29] the father. You know what it was? One
[55:31] thing after all his sacrifice that he
[55:34] had did on the earth the life that he
[55:37] this is St. John 17 right before he goes
[55:39] to Gethsemane he says the path that he
[55:42] had walked he asked for one thing that
[55:45] where I am they may be also he asked
[55:49] for our fellowship
[55:52] &gt;&gt; when the great trial was coming upon him
[55:55] but that loyal the loyalist of them all
[56:01] was beating not for himself
[56:04] but his heart was beating for others.
[56:07] Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He says that's the only thing he asked
[56:12] the father in the prayer, your
[56:14] companionship
[56:16] forever.
[56:18] If you want to read this in St. John the
[56:21] 24th verse, then how much should we
[56:23] desire him? If he desires, he says, "Now
[56:26] listen, if you're really born of the
[56:29] spirit of God, that means everything to
[56:32] you."
[56:34] See, it ain't some book of rules.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; You don't live any laws and so forth.
[56:40] You live by the grace of God
[56:43] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; It it's when you you know when when you
[56:49] think when you think of of what the Lord
[56:53] and his great trial and the crowning of
[56:55] his ministry, it it didn't look like it
[56:58] was a crown, but it truly was.
[57:02] You look at our prophet at at his great
[57:05] crowning, you could say, of his ministry
[57:07] and the the loosening of the book of
[57:10] redemption. You know, you know the
[57:12] struggles that he was going under at
[57:14] that time.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; If if you look at the timeline of his
[57:20] life, it before those seals in ' 63, in
[57:23] 1962, he was ready to go off into the
[57:27] mountaintops and
[57:29] &gt;&gt; hunting fish and
[57:32] because of the rejection of the people.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; It and you would think that was God's
[57:41] preparation
[57:42] for his prophet.
[57:48] He was preparing him not on a
[57:50] mountaintop,
[57:52] but he was preparing him in a valley.
[57:58] And you know, I I'm I'm thinking more
[58:00] and more as I as I look at this gospel,
[58:05] we
[58:07] we we must have
[58:11] our brains recalibrated.
[58:14] You know, when we think of sin,
[58:17] sin means to miss the mark,
[58:21] to miss the goal.
[58:23] That's what sin means. and and and
[58:29] the moment we lean to our intelligence
[58:33] is the moment we're missing the mark.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] And
[58:39] you know
[58:42] we look so much at speaking the word and
[58:47] third pool and you know uh speaking to
[58:51] the storm and right
[58:54] but if you really look about it look at
[58:57] it for a minute
[58:59] I don't think the greatest part
[59:02] of him speaking to the storm was
[59:04] speaking to the storm.
[59:07] But I think it was after it
[59:10] &gt;&gt; because
[59:12] it was after that he spoke to the storm.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I just stood there just looked
[59:18] around and with my hat off and I I got
[59:21] numb all over. I thought the very God of
[59:24] creation, it's all in his hands. What's
[59:28] he telling me?" I picked up my gun,
[59:30] wiped off the scope, started to walk
[59:33] back, go down the hill, and something
[59:35] said to me,
[59:37] "Why don't you stroll with me through
[59:39] the wilderness?
[59:41] Walk
[59:43] &gt;&gt; with me."
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, Lord, with all my
[59:49] heart, it would be one of the greatest
[59:51] things I could do was to walk with you."
[59:56] You know,
[59:59] this was before he was changed back
[1:00:02] young and Sister Mey came to him. That
[1:00:04] was after this cuz it was speaking to
[1:00:07] the storm. He walks with God and then he
[1:00:10] walks with God for a little bit and then
[1:00:12] God turns him back to a young man and we
[1:00:15] all know the story and the deers come up
[1:00:17] and but but to me this right here
[1:00:23] it's after the storm is over
[1:00:26] to me
[1:00:29] especially in this message is we want to
[1:00:30] speak the word and speak to the storms
[1:00:32] and
[1:00:34] but to me this right here is the mostant
[1:00:38] important part.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; It's not speaking so much to the storm,
[1:00:46] but really it's just walking with the
[1:00:48] Lord
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; because that's
[1:00:51] what this purpose of God is all about.
[1:00:56] You know, brother Brandham tells us, he
[1:00:58] says, "The entire Bible is an expression
[1:01:00] of one goal that God had, one purpose
[1:01:04] that he wanted to achieve into the
[1:01:05] entire Bible." And all the acts of the
[1:01:08] believer in the Bible has been in type
[1:01:10] and expressing what God's great goal is.
[1:01:13] And now in the last in this last day, he
[1:01:15] has revealed it and showed it. And the
[1:01:18] three-fold in the and the goal of God,
[1:01:20] the purpose of God comes in a three-fold
[1:01:22] manner. We pastors preach on this many
[1:01:25] times, right? We all know it, right? By
[1:01:26] heart. But here's what I want you to see
[1:01:31] is ultimately the first thing that was
[1:01:34] God wanted to reveal himself express
[1:01:37] himself completely God in Christ.
[1:01:39] Secondly, to have the preeminence in his
[1:01:41] bride that he might live in people to
[1:01:43] express himself through him. Thirdly, to
[1:01:46] restore the kingdom to its rightly
[1:01:47] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:01:50] Adam where to where he walked in the
[1:01:52] cool of Eden with his people talk with
[1:01:54] them.
[1:01:58] But what does it funnel down to?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; It funnels down to fellowship.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; And and you know, here's the thing. This
[1:02:10] is this is where people that want to,
[1:02:14] you know, uh speak tumors out of
[1:02:17] existence and see squirrels created and
[1:02:21] right speak to the storm and
[1:02:24] to but but that's not the three-fold
[1:02:27] purpose of God.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] All of those things happened because
[1:02:35] there was a need or a necessity.
[1:02:43] It was God taking care of his children.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; And and and when we and when we look at
[1:02:51] that,
[1:02:53] to me, the three-fold purpose was not
[1:02:56] speaking to the storm.
[1:03:00] The three-fold purpose of God was to
[1:03:03] bring us back to fellowship. Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And and and you know the thing of it is
[1:03:11] is people that that are wanting some uh
[1:03:15] outward emotion or outward manifestation
[1:03:18] and the latter rain of never
[1:03:25] right. I'm I'm not I I I believe in all
[1:03:29] those things. I know brother Brandham
[1:03:30] taught those.
[1:03:32] But to me, friends, you know, there's
[1:03:35] there's going to be no doubt millions
[1:03:37] that's going to come to him and said,
[1:03:38] "Have not I cast out devils?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Have not I prophesied in thy name? Have
[1:03:48] Have not the blinded eyes open? Have not
[1:03:50] the right."
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And what's he going to say? He's going
[1:03:54] to say, "Depart from me, you worker of
[1:03:57] iniquity. I never even knew you." Right?
[1:04:03] So, so what were they missing? What they
[1:04:06] were missing was fellowship.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; See, it it's God above us, God with us.
[1:04:15] Now, it's God in us.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And And listen, if if if that doesn't
[1:04:25] ring in your heart, something is wrong.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:32] Something
[1:04:34] is wrong.
[1:04:37] Like like like if brother Gabe is lawing
[1:04:39] you to sleep right now,
[1:04:42] something is wrong. Yeah,
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; this this gospel, this gospel story, if
[1:04:51] if if you're saying, "Brother Gabe, that
[1:04:53] listen, I don't even I'm I'm I'm trying
[1:04:56] to be cautious, you know, because, you
[1:04:59] know, we get we get little um catch
[1:05:02] words and catchphrases and right and and
[1:05:06] I'm not here to try to wow you with the
[1:05:08] seventh seal."
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] But but to me, that's what I'm preaching
[1:05:13] this morning.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to preach it without
[1:05:17] telling you.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand where I'm
[1:05:20] coming from. This this right here that
[1:05:23] God's purpose, what he was trying to do
[1:05:26] is to bring us back into fellowship.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; We had to be lost because he had to
[1:05:32] express himself. There was a part of him
[1:05:34] that was to be a savior.
[1:05:37] And in order for him to express that,
[1:05:39] there had to be something that was lost.
[1:05:42] There was an attribute of healer. But he
[1:05:44] could not express it unless there was
[1:05:47] somebody that could be sick.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; All of those things. Look, you you know
[1:05:54] you know you know when Jesus do you know
[1:05:56] when Jesus rejoiced in spirit? You know
[1:05:59] what he rejoiced in spirit over her?
[1:06:03] in the gospels. If you look at all of
[1:06:06] his times that he expressed his emotions
[1:06:10] and you know whether he was I think
[1:06:12] brother Chad said it recently about you
[1:06:14] know he had a sense of humor and he said
[1:06:16] go tell tell Herod that fox right and
[1:06:19] brother Bham said he got a sense of
[1:06:21] humor but you know there's very few
[1:06:23] times that Jesus was happy
[1:06:27] in an outward expression in his word but
[1:06:31] he was a man of sorrow and acquainted
[1:06:33] with grief but but he He would he would
[1:06:36] uh he he would rejoice in spirit.
[1:06:40] And you know what he rejoiced in spirit
[1:06:41] for is because God had hid those things
[1:06:44] from the wise and repudent. But that he
[1:06:47] would reveal them to babes such as would
[1:06:49] be so. So So Jesus would rejoice when
[1:06:53] his children saw revelation.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So So if you're struggling with God
[1:07:00] trying to I don't understand the message
[1:07:02] and it's so complex. Listen, don't don't
[1:07:05] don't in your imaginary mind think of
[1:07:08] God as some, you know, school boy kid
[1:07:11] that's tantalizing his little brother
[1:07:13] with revelation. And
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; no, no. God rejoiced when he was on
[1:07:20] earth
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; when one of his children saw it.
[1:07:23] What what you what we have to do is stop
[1:07:27] and and rewire our thinking and realize,
[1:07:30] wait a minute, I don't care what I feel,
[1:07:33] he rejoiced when when I when I saw
[1:07:36] revelation.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And God's nature does not change.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; So So what I'm going through is is got
[1:07:43] to be me.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; It's not him, it's me.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. when when look when when
[1:07:51] brother Brandham's talking about Christ
[1:07:53] the mystery of God and and he's and and
[1:07:55] he's he's uh to me this is one of the
[1:07:59] most profound quotes it just it just
[1:08:01] blows me away uh when he says these
[1:08:04] things if I could find it. Um
[1:08:13] let's see here.
[1:08:17] Yeah.
[1:08:18] He says, "But all this mystery is
[1:08:21] revealed only as he promised to his
[1:08:24] bride. Hell is against this truth of the
[1:08:28] revelation of this mystery."
[1:08:30] But the bride is standing on it. That's
[1:08:32] her stand. Why do you hunger, church?
[1:08:37] Why do you thirst? It's the father
[1:08:40] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[1:08:42] you.
[1:08:44] So, he's not keeping it from you. He's
[1:08:48] trying to reveal it to you. He's wanting
[1:08:51] to rejoice that you see it.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; But he says,
[1:08:58] I want you to say, I want you uh but you
[1:09:01] let
[1:09:05] not the devil.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; So, so listen,
[1:09:11] I I I'll be honest. Sometimes I feel
[1:09:12] sorry for the devil.
[1:09:15] He gets blamed. He gets blamed for so
[1:09:17] much.
[1:09:19] You got to know that. You got to be
[1:09:20] like, "I wasn't even there. What are you
[1:09:22] talking about?
[1:09:25] [Laughter]
[1:09:28] I'm serious."
[1:09:31] He gets blamed for the He like, "I God,
[1:09:34] I wasn't even there. I was on the other
[1:09:35] side of the world. It wasn't me.
[1:09:41] [Laughter]
[1:09:45] I'm so glad the prophet straightens us
[1:09:48] out.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "But you let so many things get
[1:09:52] it out of you."
[1:09:55] So God is trying to reveal this great
[1:09:58] mystery. You say, "Brother Gabe, I just
[1:10:00] don't understand the seven." You get
[1:10:03] Okay, calm down.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] cuz you let so many things
[1:10:11] get in your way.
[1:10:14] Remember, the father's trying
[1:10:18] to reveal it to you,
[1:10:22] but you let
[1:10:24] your job.
[1:10:27] Notice
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; where's the devil in that?
[1:10:33] Where's them demons?
[1:10:35] them demon powers
[1:10:38] that made you.
[1:10:46] And and and here's here's here's the
[1:10:48] amazing thing. This I'm so glad he put
[1:10:51] this in here because there is no
[1:10:55] Budweiser in this quote.
[1:11:02] There is no Marbel man hiding behind the
[1:11:04] corner.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; There's no marijuana.
[1:11:10] There's no pornography in this quote.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:16] This is the elect of God he's realking
[1:11:19] to.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; This is not foolish. This quote is not
[1:11:23] for foolish virgin.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. This quote is for
[1:11:27] you and I.
[1:11:30] So if we have a problem with
[1:11:32] understanding or c catching the seventh
[1:11:34] seal and this mystery that's supposed to
[1:11:36] be unfolding the three-fold purpose of
[1:11:38] God and
[1:11:41] simplicity
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; then what we need to do is we need to
[1:11:46] apply what he says and you let so many
[1:11:49] things get
[1:11:54] where is the mystery at
[1:11:59] it. He said it's in you,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; but you let so many things get it out of
[1:12:05] you.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, it don't had the
[1:12:09] preeminence
[1:12:11] that it should because God will take
[1:12:14] third place
[1:12:16] if that's all you can give him.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; If all you can give him is fifth place,
[1:12:24] he'll take it.
[1:12:28] But he wants first,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; but he won't take first. He wants you,
[1:12:33] he wants me to give it to him.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You let your wife
[1:12:46] and you let your husband
[1:12:49] and you let your children
[1:12:53] see. We
[1:12:56] All of these things are necessities
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; and all of these things we can have
[1:13:05] scripture to back up why we have to
[1:13:08] work.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Well, if I don't, I'm worse than an
[1:13:12] infidel.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; But no, it's not that. You have a
[1:13:19] problem with Amazon.
[1:13:23] That's
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:13:26] Come on, brothers.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I've been trying to be good, but
[1:13:30] seriously,
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:35] Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:13:38] You have a problem with your hobby,
[1:13:42] and your hobby is taking the
[1:13:44] preeminence.
[1:13:46] You say, "Brother Gabe, are you
[1:13:47] preaching?" No, stop. I'm not preaching
[1:13:50] against hobbies.
[1:13:52] Right? We're not talking about sitting
[1:13:54] in a room and um
[1:13:59] but the whole thing of it is is you have
[1:14:01] to have enough relationship
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; relationship with God to realize I am
[1:14:08] working too much overtime
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; and I don't have time for the Lord
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; and you have to take inventory and
[1:14:15] realize I am trying to fix everything in
[1:14:19] the house at once.
[1:14:27] and our priorities are not in line,
[1:14:32] right? And and we have to have a 2025.
[1:14:44] Oh, we have to have the big house and we
[1:14:47] have to have the boat and we have to
[1:14:48] have and we got to have the pond and we
[1:14:51] got to have the woods and we got to have
[1:14:53] the barn and
[1:14:58] and not you. Brother Gab, you preaching
[1:15:00] against barns?
[1:15:03] No, brother John. No, no,
[1:15:08] no, brother Elmer. No.
[1:15:11] Right. These brothers need a job. But
[1:15:13] they got to build them, right? That's
[1:15:16] not my point. But my point is is we can
[1:15:19] get so caught up with things that are
[1:15:22] not sin.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Right? You let your wife, we can be so
[1:15:31] tied into our family
[1:15:34] that our family becomes a hindrance.
[1:15:37] Brother Brandon would say, "I don't even
[1:15:39] express my love to my wife like I should
[1:15:43] because I don't want to mar my love for
[1:15:45] Jesus Christ." And we could say, "Yeah,
[1:15:48] but he's Malachi 4."
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; So, I'm trying not to yell. So are you.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, here we go.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hello.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, you you are you
[1:16:16] come before Elijah.
[1:16:18] [Applause]
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; There's an order to it. Behold, I
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; God
[1:16:29] send you
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[1:16:34] Elijah's last.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; So, so, so when, so see how we get our,
[1:16:43] we got our thinking. We got our
[1:16:46] thinking. And he says, "You let your
[1:16:47] job, you let your wife, you let your
[1:16:49] husband, you let your children, you let
[1:16:52] the cares of the world,
[1:16:59] you let some pastor,
[1:17:02] you listen, a ministry, church,
[1:17:08] we could all all these things are
[1:17:10] honorable
[1:17:12] things.
[1:17:14] Yeah,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; we have to take we have to work because
[1:17:18] we will be worse than an infidel. But if
[1:17:20] but if you are so consumed with your
[1:17:24] career,
[1:17:29] if you are so consumed with overtime and
[1:17:33] getting every drop
[1:17:36] and I'm guilty
[1:17:43] and we can in our mind, well, I'm just
[1:17:45] being faithful to the family. No, you're
[1:17:47] not.
[1:17:49] We're unbalanced.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; And then brother Gabe's falling asleep
[1:17:55] on Wednesdays.
[1:17:56] And it's not the preaching, it's the
[1:17:59] fact that brother Gabe is grinding every
[1:18:02] ounce of overtime for what?
[1:18:09] And it's not sin,
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; but it is
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; sin
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; because brother Gabe and you and
[1:18:20] everybody else, all of us that's guilty,
[1:18:23] we are missing the mark.
[1:18:32] You let somebody else get that out of
[1:18:34] you when you know that way down in your
[1:18:37] heart you're hungering, thirsting,
[1:18:39] hungry. It's God not dangling it.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; It's God trying
[1:18:48] to reveal it to you. See the revelation?
[1:18:55] Wh when when you look at when you look
[1:18:57] at brother Brandham and his seven church
[1:18:59] ages,
[1:19:01] what blacked out the moon?
[1:19:10] Yeah.
[1:19:13] So,
[1:19:15] the moon is you, right?
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be separate from the
[1:19:21] world.
[1:19:22] We're supposed to live a separated life.
[1:19:25] But what was the problem in Lady Oia?
[1:19:29] The earth
[1:19:31] got in the way.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Of the sun shining
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; on the church.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham just put a little
[1:19:45] sli brother go God. It was totally
[1:19:47] blacked out. But brother Brandham the
[1:19:49] prophet put a little sliver in
[1:19:53] for this last day.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And you know it's
[1:19:59] I think every one of us
[1:20:03] ought to take that sliver out
[1:20:06] and give him more.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] But if I but but if we only give him a
[1:20:20] sliver, he'll take it.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, you say, "Brother
[1:20:25] Gabe, I got this and I got that and I
[1:20:28] got this." And I get it. I understand.
[1:20:30] I'm not I'm not condemning you. All I'm
[1:20:33] trying to tell you is
[1:20:36] anybody ever take inventory?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Right? Anybody have a job? They take
[1:20:41] inventory and they got to go into the
[1:20:44] storehouse and they got to check and I
[1:20:46] got five cans of this and four this and
[1:20:49] three bags. All I'm telling you, all I'm
[1:20:52] asking you to do, I'm not telling you
[1:20:53] nothing. All I'm asking you to do is
[1:20:56] take inventory.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Because it's not God's fault that we're
[1:21:02] where we're at.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It's our fault.
[1:21:08] God's trying to reveal the revelation to
[1:21:12] us,
[1:21:14] but the problem of it is is we let
[1:21:19] and and
[1:21:22] I don't want to blame the devil.
[1:21:25] I want to put blame where blame is due.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; And the blame rests on these shoulders,
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; not on the devil's shoulders. They rest
[1:21:35] on mine.
[1:21:38] You know the you know the things that I
[1:21:41] I'm seeing this I hear the things in the
[1:21:43] message and you know it it's so profound
[1:21:46] to me. This message is sent to tear down
[1:21:51] our ideology.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; The message is sent to rewire our brains
[1:21:57] so that we don't think like normal human
[1:22:00] beings think. This message is sent so so
[1:22:04] that we don't think like normal message
[1:22:07] people think.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be I I want to be
[1:22:14] unique.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying I'm not talking about
[1:22:18] being odd, but I'm not trying to fit a
[1:22:21] cookie cutter mold.
[1:22:26] I I I I I
[1:22:29] want to just read this to you cuz to me
[1:22:33] remember this message is God in
[1:22:34] simplicity. Right.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:38] I saw this last week, week before last,
[1:22:41] this before camp, before the retreat and
[1:22:44] brother Brandham, it it it just
[1:22:50] to me is so profound.
[1:22:53] Brother Brandham is getting ready to
[1:22:56] preach the greatest series that ever was
[1:22:58] preached.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Do we have any other recordings,
[1:23:05] you know?
[1:23:08] 8 day services, something like that, and
[1:23:11] the book of redemption would be loosed.
[1:23:13] And in paragraph three of the opening
[1:23:16] message, Brother Brandham says this.
[1:23:19] I'm bringing you this morning greetings
[1:23:22] from my wife and my children who long to
[1:23:25] be here at this time for this dedication
[1:23:28] service and these a week of consecration
[1:23:31] to Christ.
[1:23:33] But the children are in school
[1:23:36] and it's hard to get away.
[1:23:50] He He just had seven angels
[1:23:54] come to him.
[1:23:58] He just held the king's sword
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; and was commissioned to go back.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; And loose the book of redemption
[1:24:06] by the mighty angel coming down.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; He's going to stay at brother
[1:24:11] Bankswood's house right next door to
[1:24:13] him. So his house is empty
[1:24:22] and his wife and children stay home for
[1:24:26] school.
[1:24:40] I just let him marinate for a minute.
[1:24:42] There is
[1:24:45] I'm trying to be good, brother. Just
[1:24:51] see because in this message, people have
[1:24:55] the wrong concept
[1:24:57] of education.
[1:25:06] to me
[1:25:08] that quote right there. I have listened
[1:25:10] and read this message
[1:25:13] since 2003. And I can't tell you how
[1:25:15] many times I've listened to God hiding
[1:25:17] in simplicity.
[1:25:19] And to my shame, this just comes up. And
[1:25:22] when it did, it was like a lightning
[1:25:24] bolt in my soul
[1:25:28] because we have to rewire our thinking.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] because I don't want
[1:25:38] I don't want
[1:25:41] my son-in-laws,
[1:25:43] if God grants me them, to have to work
[1:25:47] 60 hours a week.
[1:25:52] I don't want
[1:25:55] my daughters to have to
[1:25:59] work a job.
[1:26:02] So, in order for that to happen, what
[1:26:05] has to happen
[1:26:08] for my son-in-laws?
[1:26:15] I don't want my grandchildren to have to
[1:26:18] go to public school. So, what has to
[1:26:21] happen
[1:26:23] to my daughter? She has to be able to
[1:26:27] instruct
[1:26:29] my grandchildren. Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; She has to explain to them algebra.
[1:26:43] And I think that prophet understood it
[1:26:45] too.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I hope that quote don't make you mad,
[1:26:52] right?
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:26:55] he wasn't ashamed to say it.
[1:27:00] And so if he's not ashamed to say it,
[1:27:02] I'm not ashamed to display it
[1:27:05] cuz I
[1:27:07] believe that
[1:27:09] we have to have a balance.
[1:27:13] And I don't know
[1:27:15] what the balance is,
[1:27:18] but I'm asking God, please, Lord, I just
[1:27:21] want to be balanced. Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to have a a pet
[1:27:26] doctrine.
[1:27:27] And I don't want to go on a tangent.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; I just want to be steady and level.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; I want to be loyal, faithful, and true.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And you know, in order to be loyal and
[1:27:41] faithful, you can't have an agenda.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; If if you have an agenda, loyalty takes
[1:27:49] second place. Yeah, that's right.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; If if you if you have a motive,
[1:27:55] if you have a motive, you will not find
[1:27:57] the purpose of God.
[1:28:00] The Bible tells us, "But he that shall
[1:28:03] endure unto the end,
[1:28:06] and that end means the aim, the purpose,
[1:28:09] the same shall be saved."
[1:28:12] If we are to endure there has we have to
[1:28:17] check and see what our loyalty is to.
[1:28:23] I don't want it just I don't want my
[1:28:25] loyalty just to be to my family
[1:28:29] and my job
[1:28:31] and my church.
[1:28:36] But I think above all our loyalty above
[1:28:38] everything
[1:28:40] ought to be our loyalty to Jesus Christ.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "I've got my mind
[1:28:47] set on this message." That's that third
[1:28:49] pull, and it's the one I must be loyal
[1:28:54] and reverent to.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] So what was the attributes
[1:28:59] of of of that prophet being connected to
[1:29:03] the third p pool?
[1:29:06] Loyalty
[1:29:08] and reverence.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; And that's not just for him.
[1:29:14] That's for you, too.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:17] Because you you
[1:29:22] this right here, right there,
[1:29:29] you
[1:29:31] are a part of that vision.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was to catch that
[1:29:39] rainbow trout, that covenant fish,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; and that was a symbol.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the reality that I'm preaching
[1:29:48] to this morning because that it does no
[1:29:51] good to see the symbol.
[1:29:57] We have to recognize the reality.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; We have to recognize
[1:30:04] you
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; are the reality
[1:30:08] that that that
[1:30:10] you are the I send you. You are the you
[1:30:15] in Malachi 4,
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; right? that that I would love to be able
[1:30:21] to speak to the storm. But brother
[1:30:24] Brandham said that, you know, that that
[1:30:26] that that
[1:30:28] I'm going to paraphrase, but when he's
[1:30:30] referring to that, he he uh he says uh I
[1:30:34] don't know if I'll be able to find it,
[1:30:35] but but he says uh paraphrasing, he says
[1:30:38] uh that that the prophet was doing the
[1:30:41] um
[1:30:45] maybe I could find it
[1:30:52] He says he's he is trying to this is in
[1:30:55] uh he that is in you. He says he is
[1:30:58] trying to find that person that he can
[1:31:00] vindicate himself through. Now that
[1:31:02] doesn't mean he has to do it to
[1:31:04] everybody. Now in the time of Moses that
[1:31:07] Moses led the children of Israel there
[1:31:09] was one that was Moses. The rest of them
[1:31:12] just followed the message. Yes. Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; See, so I I don't have to speak to the
[1:31:19] storm. All I have to do is walk with
[1:31:23] him.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; All I have to do is hear him say, "Won't
[1:31:28] you walk with me?"
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And and to me, you say, "Brother Gabe,
[1:31:33] that's that." Listen, I know that people
[1:31:35] could be critical of that and uh you
[1:31:38] know, like frozen chosen, and that's
[1:31:41] fine. Uh,
[1:31:43] that's okay.
[1:31:45] But to me,
[1:31:47] I I'll stand I'll stand the ridicule.
[1:31:51] I just want to walk with him.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And I I I want to I want to keep my head
[1:31:56] above all the fanaticism that follows
[1:32:00] this message.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And I just want to walk with him.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; I don't care. I I I don't I Oh, man.
[1:32:09] in my heart. God knows
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; the voice.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; It It don't I I just don't want to say
[1:32:14] it brashfully. I I don't care what it
[1:32:17] costs me.
[1:32:19] it it it I just want to walk with him
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; cuz because when we see this world where
[1:32:26] it's you know we see the world where
[1:32:28] it's at and and I
[1:32:31] to me friends if we ain't careful
[1:32:35] we can let time space and matter take
[1:32:39] the place of the preeminence of the
[1:32:40] third pool.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:32:49] And and the and
[1:32:51] the the the terrifying thing is we have
[1:32:54] to live in those three dimensions.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; But the but the but the the test is to
[1:33:04] not those let those three dimensions
[1:33:06] take prereeminence. That's right. Amen.
[1:33:09] It's it's it's it's it's to be able to
[1:33:12] have that ability
[1:33:15] that when everything falls apart,
[1:33:20] when
[1:33:22] when we do get so caught up in the cares
[1:33:25] of this life
[1:33:28] that we have enough humility to realize,
[1:33:32] I'm missing the mark. Yes.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And
[1:33:40] I
[1:33:44] I want to be loyal.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I just want to be faithful to what the
[1:33:50] Lord has given in this hour.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; And and in all honesty, I want you to
[1:33:59] become second place.
[1:34:05] I want I want my family
[1:34:08] to be second.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And as much as I love my family and you,
[1:34:15] I want him to have first place.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; But I let so many things take it out of
[1:34:22] me.
[1:34:27] And it's not sin,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; but it's sin
[1:34:35] because sin means to miss the goal,
[1:34:40] the path of right and duty.
[1:34:46] To miss the mark, to miss oneself,
[1:34:50] to lose oneself.
[1:34:54] That's the definition of sin.
[1:34:58] And if we could if we could have that
[1:35:00] definition in our mind and recalibrate
[1:35:05] our mind to not think about
[1:35:08] cell phones and iPads and
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; I believe we ought to be a million miles
[1:35:17] down the road from that.
[1:35:21] But I believe we ought to have enough
[1:35:23] discernment and honesty
[1:35:26] and integrity
[1:35:30] in our lives to say, "God,
[1:35:33] I'm missing the mark."
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:39] because I've let so many things
[1:35:42] get in the way,
[1:35:49] you know, and we'll close on this.
[1:35:54] And you know, when brother Brandon was
[1:35:56] out hunting with brother with brother
[1:36:00] Bert call lizard eyes,
[1:36:05] maybe you can stand with me.
[1:36:10] You know, brother Brandham no doubt
[1:36:12] fellowshipped and
[1:36:15] hunted with him many a time.
[1:36:24] But
[1:36:28] after all of those
[1:36:31] fishing expeditions that brother
[1:36:33] Brandham did with a rifle in his hand,
[1:36:38] cuz though he may have had a rifle in
[1:36:40] his hand, he was trying
[1:36:45] to catch Bert.
[1:36:51] and all of those opportunities
[1:36:55] that you think this is what this is what
[1:36:58] just blows my mind about God when you
[1:37:01] start thinking about how he works.
[1:37:04] God sent lizard eyes Malachi 4
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; over and over and over and over again.
[1:37:15] Yeah.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham
[1:37:21] couldn't crack his shell.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And and I have a hard time. You play
[1:37:28] something soft, brother. I have a hard
[1:37:31] time wrapping my mind around that
[1:37:36] because when people would see him, they
[1:37:38] would see God.
[1:37:44] So much so that they would baptize in
[1:37:46] his name.
[1:37:49] But Bert Call would spend no doubt hour
[1:37:53] upon hour upon hour
[1:37:59] and that prophet
[1:38:02] would say,
[1:38:04] "It wasn't a sermon I preached.
[1:38:08] It wasn't a song that was sung.
[1:38:12] It was a display of something that was
[1:38:14] so real
[1:38:16] that he seen something real. And that
[1:38:19] mother's loyalty led that man.
[1:38:25] See that mama deer
[1:38:28] wasn't playing loyalty
[1:38:31] and she wasn't playing church.
[1:38:35] She had something in her. She was born a
[1:38:37] mother.
[1:38:39] something
[1:38:41] real.
[1:38:43] And to me, God's ways are past finding
[1:38:47] out
[1:38:50] that God would use
[1:38:53] Brother Brandham in such a powerful way.
[1:38:57] But there would still no doubt be a
[1:38:59] teaching moment that that Malachi 4
[1:39:02] would have to sit on the sidelines to a
[1:39:04] mother deer.
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:11] You you wonder what he did that night in
[1:39:13] the tent when he's praying to the Lord
[1:39:16] and thinking about the day and going
[1:39:19] through his mind of all the times he
[1:39:21] threw out the line to fish for Bert and
[1:39:24] Bert just swatted away.
[1:39:27] called him a chicken-hearted preacher.
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:34] And God would just wink at that
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] because there would be an appointed
[1:39:43] time. Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; That there would be a little deer, a
[1:39:47] mama deer,
[1:39:50] that would display loyalty.
[1:39:54] And that loyalty would be displayed in
[1:39:56] such a way
[1:39:59] that it would break
[1:40:02] that stony heart
[1:40:04] of brother Bert call
[1:40:08] and he would
[1:40:12] he would
[1:40:16] look down that scope
[1:40:19] and that scope starts shaking
[1:40:22] and his heart is trembling.
[1:40:26] And when he came to that breaking spot,
[1:40:29] he'd say, "Preacher,
[1:40:31] lead me to that Jesus Christ you've
[1:40:33] talked so much about.
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:48] This message,
[1:40:50] that's that third pull.
[1:40:53] And it's the one
[1:40:56] we
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] we
[1:41:03] must be loyal
[1:41:06] and reverent to.
[1:41:09] And I I pray and I'm sure it's your
[1:41:13] prayer. God, help us.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[1:41:19] [Music]
[1:41:29] Lord Jesus,
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:35] truly Lord,
[1:41:39] I'm sure my brothers and sisters are in
[1:41:43] agreement
[1:41:45] as touching this one thing.
[1:41:48] We want that loyalty
[1:41:51] that was displayed.
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:57] And you promised that
[1:41:59] if two would agree as touching any one
[1:42:01] thing, you'd bring it to pass.
[1:42:04] That's my heart.
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:12] That's our heart's cry, Lord.
[1:42:22] Lord, we let so many things
[1:42:26] so many things
[1:42:29] take it out of the way.
[1:42:34] But Lord, we're asking this morning
[1:42:38] in the cry of our heart that you would
[1:42:43] be our helper.
[1:42:46] Lord, we just want to walk with you.
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] That'd be the greatest thing we could
[1:42:54] have.
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:42:59] Lord, we want to set jobs,
[1:43:03] careers,
[1:43:06] ministry,
[1:43:08] family,
[1:43:10] church,
[1:43:15] our study life,
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:20] and
[1:43:23] mentally speaking.
[1:43:27] and we just want to walk with you.
[1:43:33] Lord, I I pray that your purpose would
[1:43:39] be fulfilled in our lives.
[1:43:43] We have a deep crying out to a deep and
[1:43:46] that means there has to be a deep to
[1:43:49] respond.
[1:43:51] And you see your people's needs this
[1:43:54] morning.
[1:43:56] And we're asking, Lord, that you would
[1:43:58] just meet our needs.
[1:44:01] That your great Holy Spirit would
[1:44:04] reveal to us the things that are a miss
[1:44:07] in our life.
[1:44:09] Help us, God, to
[1:44:13] take inventory,
[1:44:16] [Music]
[1:44:18] Lord. We want to be loyal to you and you
[1:44:20] alone.
[1:44:25] for you alone are worthy.
[1:44:30] I pray that you'd help us
[1:44:33] to
[1:44:35] g the armor a little bit tighter
[1:44:38] after today.
[1:44:41] would set aside the cares of this life
[1:44:47] and
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:52] we would give you the first place. Yes.
[1:44:57] Lord, we
[1:45:02] see that
[1:45:04] you would train Moses under the
[1:45:08] Egyptians for 40 years and him be a
[1:45:11] military genius
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:17] and raise
[1:45:21] under the teachings of the Egyptians
[1:45:25] with a determination to be a deliverer
[1:45:28] of your people.
[1:45:31] And you would allow all of that
[1:45:34] for him to fail miserably
[1:45:37] cuz he would be an example to us
[1:45:41] as your prophet taught us that it's not
[1:45:43] by might nor by power but by your
[1:45:47] spirit.
[1:45:49] And Lord, we want that great Holy Spirit
[1:45:51] to work in our lives in a greater
[1:45:53] measure.
[1:45:55] Lord, that you'd have full sway, full
[1:45:57] reign
[1:46:00] seven days, a week, and as many nights
[1:46:07] that you would be the very forefront of
[1:46:10] our hearts and thoughts.
[1:46:14] Lord, we can't do that in ourselves,
[1:46:18] but we're asking that
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:21] you'd help us to surrender to you in a
[1:46:23] greater way,
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:28] Lord. That
[1:46:31] we as
[1:46:33] your people this morning would
[1:46:39] have favor with you.
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:44] and that you would grant the desires of
[1:46:46] our heart.
[1:46:51] Truly Lord, we love you. We commit all
[1:46:54] we are into your hands
[1:46:58] and we ask these things to be so in
[1:46:59] Jesus lovely name.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:05] Praise the Lord. You happy to be in the
[1:47:07] house of the Lord this morning?
[1:47:11] Amen.
[1:47:13] Let's sing a
[1:47:15] song together. I just want to praise the
[1:47:17] Lord. That's what we came here, right?
[1:47:20] Let's just
[1:47:23] let's praise him.
[1:47:26] I just want to please
[1:47:29] the Lord.
[1:47:34] be in his will in every way.
[1:47:39] To be lost in his presence,

[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Be in his will in every way.

[1:48:41] Found in his likeness.
[1:48:44] To hear him say, "Well done." Someday
[1:48:49] once more.

[1:49:49] Oh, I know the time is near. For
