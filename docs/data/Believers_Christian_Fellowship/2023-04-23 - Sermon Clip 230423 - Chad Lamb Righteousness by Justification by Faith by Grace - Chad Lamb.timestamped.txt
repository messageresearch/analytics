[0:00] before the law God had righteous
[0:04] servants
[0:05] Abel was righteous Abraham was righteous
[0:08] the question is how were they righteous
[0:10] they were righteous by faith
[0:13] before the law the children of God were
[0:16] declared righteous by faith because they
[0:18] believed God
[0:19] Abel believed God
[0:21] Abraham believed God they didn't believe
[0:24] the same part
[0:27] does that make sense
[0:28] they believed the present tense God the
[0:31] I am God The God Who was coming to them
[0:33] by Revelation and giving them the word
[0:35] for their day and when Abel received the
[0:37] Revelation for his day he was declared
[0:40] he witnessed that he was righteous
[0:42] when Abraham received the the
[0:44] instructions from God the word of God
[0:46] for his day it was imputed unto him for
[0:48] righteousness
[0:50] praise God
[0:52] then the law comes and then all the
[0:54] Deeds started amen but before the law
[0:57] remember the law came as a failure of
[1:00] Israel to keep the word of God and come
[1:02] up into the mountain and exodus to come
[1:04] to Sinai they ran away and brother bam
[1:07] said that's where they made their fatal
[1:08] mistake in Exodus 19 they chose law over
[1:11] Grace God wasn't going to give them the
[1:14] law he was going to give them Grace all
[1:16] he was going to give them was the Ten
[1:17] Commandments and that was it
[1:19] the book of ordinances and all the laws
[1:22] and the rituals it came after they
[1:24] turned from God and sent Moses up
[1:26] God was going to deal with them with
[1:28] Grace where they would receive a
[1:30] revelation of the word and when they and
[1:32] that Revelation as they believed it
[1:34] would be imputed unto them for
[1:35] righteousness
[1:37] that's how it was before
[1:40] but now that the law was fulfilled in
[1:42] Christ and he became the ultimate
[1:44] sacrifice freeing us from the bondage of
[1:46] the law it has gone right back to what
[1:48] it was before now it's righteousness by
[1:50] Faith by a revelation in your God in
[1:53] your day in Jesus Christ today
[1:58] you see how the message opens the whole
[2:00] Bible
[2:02] things that are fundamental to
[2:04] Christianity they've been absolutely
[2:06] lost they've been they've been they've
[2:08] been hijacked amen and they've made it
[2:11] repeat after me prayers repeat after me
[2:13] I believe Jesus died for me on a cross
[2:15] 2000 years ago and they're repeating
[2:18] this and they're acknowledging what
[2:19] happened Amen in in declaring people to
[2:22] be righteous and to be justified but my
[2:24] goodness the Revelation from the Bible
[2:26] it's everybody who had imputed
[2:28] righteousness it was declared righteous
[2:30] or witnessed to be righteous were people
[2:31] who believe the god of their day
[2:34] the I am present tense of God and the
[2:38] Bible so opens up the Revelation the
[2:41] truth of justification the truth of
[2:43] righteousness
[2:45] and the message has taken us back to the
[2:48] realities
[2:50] of these things
