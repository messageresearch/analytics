I while you're trying to do that I have heard my pastor coming here when he's not preaching on Wednesday Sunday he comes after week he said I feel nervous he said what Brother Kyle will come here and say I don't know I only have an hour an hour 10 minutes I don't know what brother Ben would say about that but just put all those together mixed with water with concrete and let it dry that's how I'm feeling right now very heavy will speak to us so Hebrews 10 24-26 and this is just this is not the main scripture for the our film this morning as this is just what we are here to do one another it says and this is Paul speaking it says and let us consider one another to provoke and to love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another in in so much the more as you see the day approaching you may be seated may God bless the reading of his word I just pulled this up and uh so we're here this morning not to bring something new because we know that everything has been old you yourself you are old because you didn't you didn't just come on earth a few years ago I remember brother Brandon could look at his son Billy Paul he said Billy when I was 16 years old the Billy Paul you were in me so what would be Billy's Paul's birthday then because probably he had him on he returned to 24 or 25 so nine years prior to that not only that even when he was a little kid Billy Paul was still inside of him so that you can tell how much old even the seals are not old that are not new everything has been so it's just the Revelation that uncovers it and unveils it for our day and I like the way the prophet of God brings it up and this is just we're family here right this morning we have no big big toes and and smoke toes we're the same here children of God and the prophet of God said this and the message is life worthy of the Gospel in 1963 he said we have assembled it together father for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better and to live closer to you that's our purpose this morning we don't want to show up that say I know better we will never even know so what what we will never know in this world will be just a little dust off of God's Gods maybe foot will never you will hear how the prophet of God tells us for we see the day approaching and we must assemble ourselves together oft and take instruction from you in the possessing all things he reiterate the same thought so our heavenly father thou has chosen that we should gather together it's the will of God today this morning you have gathered together around the world of God this is his will his word it's the will of God that we should assemble ourselves together as we see the day approaching and that regularly Lord to bring ourselves closer to you and closer to each other in a bond of Fellowship through the shed blood of Jesus which makes it possible it's more more deeper than I can even explain it every time we get together there is a portion of a scripture we are fulfilling and the prophet of God said that the only way to stay in Divine Fellowship is to keep that word keeping a piece of God's word is still keeping his word because he said that look what caused all that we have going on today it's just because one little piece of God's word was left up in the message Oneness the prophet of God says now just one little piece of a Commandment that she disobeyed but Adam's bride disobeyed just a little piece of commandment and distorted the whole thing because she did that it made every hungry child that was ever in the world every pain of death every sorrow we're just naming them to see what living out a little piece of commandment every pain of death every sorrow every heartache she did it right there meaning right when we leave out the Peace of God's commandment just right then we don't know the list of things that we have opened up he continues and said what a horrible thing to disbelieve God's word every person that groans in pain of every death that ever was or ever will be she did it right then that puts away weight on when and how do I have to look at the word of God today regardless on which form which shape it comes to us we should consider it says every little unwitted child she did it right then every child born out of wedlock every sin that was ever committed this is just for about a little piece she left out but look what what we're talking about here I know some of us who have been going maybe through deep pains some we have not even come experienced them some are even greater than we can understand them that this is just because of one little piece of commandment of God everything that was ever committed she caused it right there by doing what the prophet of God Says by keeping every word right down but one little place here she reasoned she kept every word down brother will not even arrived there yet she kept every word down but one little place that makes me just as a human being to be very careful very watchful with anything that pertains to God anything that might be his commandment anything that might be his word because you can we can keep it every word down but one little piece where would it be in my life where would that be in your life because if we have that little peace remaining there it's gonna cause the very same thing because God doesn't change God doesn't change in reasoning I looked up a word reasoning excuse me if I can take this off the word reasoning I looked at it it said I said to think to understand but the most striking was it's to form a judgment by a process of a logic to make it sensible to justify for inaction so when we are reasoning in reality we are forming a judgment now who are you to form a judgment before you can form a judgment you need some kind of authority so Adam's bride by reasoning just one little piece in that little little piece she gave herself an authority to make a judgment now that's the blessing that we have that if God leaves us in the same condition that we can believe down to come to only live one piece out we will be in the same boat but because of his loving kindness his bowels of Mercies he wants things to go back the way they were he sent the word that had never never never the Earth this precious message that we have it is the fullness of God himself haven't given himself to you that I'm giving myself all to you that not even a chance of you missing out a little peace and that should put a price on this message it should put a price on it it's Beauty should become the most valuable valuable thing then even yourself it has come to read out of you and me every attempt to observe Authority every attempt to believe down and live out one piece it's your as we heard last Wednesday it's your security you will never have any other security but this message I like how Wednesday the Lord the Holy Spirit was speaking to us said Christ has come to seek and gather the pieces of himself and for him to do that he has those those no leaks somewhere for a little peace there's no leak so we have come this morning with only one anticipation that whatsoever I have put here scripture called it's a letter that he would use me and use you to speak because he speaks on both ends and when he speaks we can hear his voice and when we hear his word we have everlasting life there's something that struck me it's a in the crisis the mystery of God revealed this is before brother Brandon reads out the scripture to start preaching he's referring to brother Bill down in his mentioning brother tambra so it hits home because we know brother Tom and his beautiful smile before he left us but he's doing like this he's referring to the Book of John the first John 5 24. where Jesus Christ said very verily I say unto you he that Hearth my word and believe it on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it is passed from Death unto life he's saying this just pay attention he hasn't even started preaching yet but he's just talking and checking that there's something deeper there that he's striking he said I'm reading it's uh those that have the book it's uh at the paragraph 18. he's asking in the congregation he's asking hey does any anybody know whether the Dow family and any any of them got down today or not sister down brother Brown are you here brother Brown is asking and brother Thomas speaking to brother Brennan and Tom it says that Tom Brown comments about the brother Bill doll they build those condition and coming down brother REM is laying kind of explaining how brother Builder that was almost left us he was sick and then brother Brennan drove to Lima Ohio to come and visit him he thought that Lima Ohio was just the nearby you hip skip they found out it was far away from Jeffersonville so he's speaking about brother Bill down and then his act there's something that a little conversation that happened between brother Bill down brother Branham and brother Brahm is going to mention it uh he said build out said the other day I was talking to him he said brother man do you think I'm all right brother Brenner little tiny question do you think I'm all right and brother bran comes down to this he said okay brother Bill I said did you ever go to a doctor for a physical checkup he said yes sir I said the doctor will put stethoscope in his ears put them on your heart see if your heart is beating right and electrical cardiogram and the blood pressure or urine test and so forth instruments to find out where your physical being now the way he does that he looks back at a book so he tests you here and then there's a book there he can look at do things from the test to the book maybe your condition might have worsened or maybe have improved so there's no there's always a disconnection between the test and the book and the prophet of God says uh he looks at the book here where Specialists on these different subjects are wrote down if this takes place this is what's wrong I said now the only stethoscope that I have is the Bible which is which is which is something simple because it's the testing the testing and it's the very same book he's going to be reading out it's no more testing stethoscopes and coming to the book now they're combined into one the testing material in the book that stays out the condition or the your healing it's in one needs to get some water he'd say and I said now the only stethoscope I have is the Bible see for the soul and I said I'm going to give you the test I said Saint John 24 5 24 said he that heareth my word I said it didn't just sit and listening so brother Branham is telling us what hearing my word means he said it isn't just sit and listening if we do that it's good but it's not it yet that's receiving it that's hearing it's right it's receiving it you believe it something inside of you tells you it's right that's a hearing the word of God something inside of you your mouth might say Amen your mouth might be shut or anything might be going on but there's something inside of you there that says that's right you've accepted it you believe it it's yours so hearing his word means that it's yours you have possessed it you are one with it he that heareth it's already yours my word and believe him on him that sent me you believe that how many believe that or you've got you've got the whole thing you've got the book never got the book so it's and I just read that just to signify for brother Charlie lamb to me to say that but with the little experience I had last year I think I spoken about that of me passing [Music] on the airplane is something that has become real to me this word I don't take it like something it used to be and I know that some of them are maybe further there but for me personally something has become a reality it's been it's been a reality but it becomes a you cannot tell the level of the reality it has become to you every time sometimes I do not know when brother Chad or a minister and brother preaching here and down there probably I don't know how many times I would say amen I don't count that I might battle someone close to me but it's something that I cannot contain because it has become me every word I could say Amen to every word for a million times if God gives me enough breath in the service because it's something that is a reality inside and I just pray that you become more and more a substance to each and every one of us gonna be reading in the Book of John John first John chapter one I'm 35 to 51 so that's a little verse a few verses we're going to be getting our little subject there John 1 we're going to be reading from 35 to go 40 41. my Bible saw my glasses are kind of having a glare so sometimes I have to look into this so if you are there we can start reading again the next day after John stood in two of his disciples what I'm reading it's going to be the last the last three days of John's Baptist ministry we know that his ministry was to declare the Lord that was suddenly entered into his Temple he was preparing the way for the Messiah to come and now we we know from the beginning that during his ministry the whole Judea Jerusalem they were going to be baptized of John multitudes have followed his ministry priests cyruses Pharisees Soldiers the people the publicans this the prophet of God describes it as a it was a six-month Revival multitude were after him because they were convinced that this was a prophet something they have never sinned and hit their history because before John there were other prophets but there was a length of time that a prophet had not appeared on the scene yet so John no Miracles is the prophet of God said but just the preaching the the depth of the word words that were coming out of this man that had no no nice clothes on him clothed on him but they knew something was convincing that this was a prophet but here we see him on this last of the three days staying only with two disciples and I know brother Chad and other ministers of touched on this before but I just want to revisit it just to provoke you to love provoke you to Good Good Deeds Good Deeds what is it Lord we show us how to how can we do Good Deeds no it's a believing just to provoke you to God's faith to believe in him so here he is only staying with the two we know the first of the three days he starts with John 1 Chapter verse 19 but we're going to be keeping reading this again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and he looked Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God I like reading the Bible with the lenses of the Revelation I know brother Chad said that I wish God could just erase my memory with the Pinnacle Pentecostal background of what I'm reading because when we have those that are hindering us from even seeing the pictures here is a man a male walking by and John is looking at this male is declaring this is a lamb you would be confused how would the man be become a lamb How could a man become a lamb of God and I know that in the previous um uh versus even some of his disciples left him because it became so strong on them that he is pointing out his second cousin as the Lamb of God I know some of the word there said John we've told with you or these all these months we've been laboring in the ministry and now you're kind of letting us down you are pointing to your second cousin that this is the Lamb of God so we've been wasting our time it was too hard for them to to understand that this is this is a family called this is a family affair here you John pointing to your second cousin declaring that you've been waiting for him you've been waiting to introduce the Messiah and what are we seeing your second cousin there was too much for them to handle they had to fade away so from multitudes the wish to be associated with John multitude vanish the first day when they came from Jerusalem sent by the by the the headquarters the priests these or the priests and the Levites of the Pharisees the Bible stipulated its Pharisees the the the the the strongest the Bold the worst of the worst the Pharisees they came from Jerusalem or you are you the Christ are you Elias are you the prophet no he said I am the voice meaning that's scripture that you see in your school there and I we're one they they couldn't see that they couldn't see that and in another way in another fashion John could have responded to all those three questions with a yes he was not the Christ but yes by just saying that I am the voice that was Christ there because Christ is the interpretation of the word he was not the Christ he was a Christ he could said yes in a form in a sense are you Elias he could say I am a liar but he would not help them because he was fading away he was decreasing he had only one day left he could not point back to himself again are you the prophet I am not the prophet of Deuteronomy you're waiting for but he was a prophet to all those three questions he had a reason to say I am yes to all of them and he would not have helped them he had the greater Mission he was decreasing and for us to understand better what was happening to John let's read what happened to our prophet in this generation in the looking unto Jesus the prophet of God said when Paul was speaking one time to a group of people why they listened to him closely as long as he stayed in the law as long as he went the same way they went they always went it was good but he wants to turn a corner he said but when he began to tell about the revelation of the heavenly vision quickly it changed the congregation this pattern was for John was for brother Branham it's going to be for you and me in life it's going to be the same pattern in your life you're going to have many friends many family members tapping you on the shoulders oh you're the good one you're the the funny one you're the good one but once you start joining yourself with this revelation they're going to be starting pulling away from you even those that who used to love you that oh when he shows up here everybody's going to be laughing they're going to be mad at you because you're no longer their friend you no longer act like them the congregation is going to be fading away on you even in the house in the home there might be things with Christian things that that don't bother us someone could wear a skirt or a son can wear this one said you know what I see with God's word that this is no longer holding family The Clash will be coming into the family the husband might see that first if you see first just know that the Clash is there on your spouse to start pulling away if the the wife sees it first or vice versa the congregation will start fading away on you I know most of you guys you have experiences with the family relatives some cannot even call you to talk to you because you believe a cult because what you believe is hard it's harsh that's that's the reality the bride will have the same pattern they rose up to screaming if they they just listen to what the man said he was revealing the truth of God by the word some time ago in a big city in the in this United States I was invited for a Revival just a few people there that turned out I think he's referring to Chicago meaning in Chicago and I taken my love offering to make the breakfast free to some of the Year communicable Believers there in the city and told them to come out I would like to speak with them and tell them my purpose of being here of being there to help the city to help the sick to help them every Church well that morning when Dr leeville was my speaker at the campaign he had introduced me to the the audience after the breakfast I looked I took this text I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision [Music] just in a moment I noticed a minister look at his watch reached over and nodded his head to the other fellow got up and went out before I had said six or eight words almost a third of that ministerial group had walked out by the time I got to where I could say something about the texts there was just about three or four sitting they all they had all got up and gone the decreasing and the increasing this bride will decrease in the very same way every ministry will take the same pattern every home of a Believer will take the same pattern because the word will not be mixed with nothing else it's a seed that stands out on its own but before two and then let's keep on reading that this is a little bible study have been going on here but there's a mortal to it than what am I even bring here 37. and the two disciples heard him speak so 36 said and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them what seek ye they said unto him Rabbi which is to say being interpreted a master where dwelleth thou he said unto them come and see they came and saw were he dwell and Abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour something strange is in this kind of in these verses the the two John could not explain they knew John it was a Simon's brother Andrew and and another they don't give the name they knew they knew Jesus that he was second cousin to John but they couldn't go they stayed there these two and he's pointing to this male this cousin of his being the lamb they could not explain that maybe they had some references to referring to the Lamb of Isaiah 12 or the the Lamb of Isaiah Exodus 12 or Isaiah 53 11 there was to be to Bear the iniquity of them all but they stayed there and as they are following Jesus it's strange that they were following Jesus and Jesus turned to ask them what they were after now let's take let's wipe out our memory of everything you have the very creator the one who put every cell that were in their bodies who knew their mind he is walking knowing how many chemicals he put in those two bodies how many of calcium were in those two bodies how many of everything now he's turning around to ask a question what kind of question would that be it's just just it's just like Europe having a wound and then the open wound that's hurting so bad and someone comes with a needle inside of that wound pushes them meaning that Jesus knew exactly to pinpoint their question their need and they had responded it to it in a way that it might not even look clear to us but it was exactly what was inside of them he's looking at them what's seeking he knew that deep inside them they were seeking for something they had a question and they answered they said and we will find out that Dwelling Place that's the title a little title of our subject the indwelling the indwelling of Christ and then we see as they give the response he said unto them they said where dwelleth thou he said come and see and that's the best that he could have offered them but for us to to to understand why his even telling them to come that they can see the prophet of God speaks to us about that in in crisis the mystery of God revealed this always blows my mind he said the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people a great desire from God he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space time and Eternity we already lost there space I'm lost I don't know how far it would go Time We Lost eternity in badly speaking we are lost you're talking about things that cannot be in language of man the mortal he said he couldn't do he couldn't he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people he wanted to reveal himself to the people but look what dimension he's in he could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious too mysterious how could that great being or now we're taking another level now of understanding how could that great being that never did begin how could you even fathom that that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundred of billions and trillions and trillions of years I mean heard that could you repeat them for me this this this this this is melting me how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillion and trillion of years of light space and on out into eternity into it Infinity into Infinity the infinite and great creature that was all and still is we are completely knocked out now this great being that we cannot fathom wanted to be revealed to his people the prophet of God said he wanted to express himself one of his great three-fold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to identify himself with human being but how would you ident how would this infinite identify with my brother and my sister and secondly and to identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ secondly to have preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he my not only be identified with people he becomes even deeper to live in people oh how do you take this and bring it down there there's just no way how would you take this infinite being where are we going to put it how the only thing you can be swallowed into it but no he wants to come into you now this this will give you chills and humility to know that the god the infinite one is longing to be inside of you it should be that the most thing that would humble any mortal any motto God's holy spirit that is promised to come in indwell within you it should be the most reverent Reverend being ever in our lives because it's funneling this infinite into you something very interesting he keep kept on he said now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them I don't know how would his God as a man how would he even do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now their head oh I love this their head to be some way to get it back again he's still determined not only to be identified with human beings but he is still determined to live inside them and there had to be some way to get it back in that's where Christ steps in anything he could do he had to use Christ Christ is the one it's the love of God to you see what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never be able to express his fullness that's where he the nominations might not are blown his full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior you say how do you know he was he is because I've had an experience see he is a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through Christ it's the full Christ that he has been achieving anything that he ever is because Christ would take him from this mysterious being and bring it to us so when Christ will have a deeper meaning than it's just that just a ghost no it's God himself but in a way that he can relate to us in a way that he can come and live in Us in everything we have it's only through Christ because everything he had only through Christ and also he said in the Hebrews the book of Hebrews he said Christ revealed the god he said um he said it's no not me that do what the work it's my father that dwelleth in me I do nothing in myself but what I see the father doing the father in me showing me these visions and then I go do just what the father told me to do you get it God was inside inside of a human body not being not behind the goat's kids died but was living moving God had hands God had feet God had tongue God had eyes and it was Christ there he was so we're seeing that as we read the scripture in the Book of John this to fellow they could not understand or explain why they still stayed with John the Baptist after he pointed them to a man which was his second cousin and then he even told them that I knew him not twice in the same verse in the same chapter I knew him not someone says this some of his followers said you mean you don't know him I said I knew him not because he was speaking the spiritual level and they were in the flesh and said you should know him this is your second cousin but these two disciples they heard that they saw that but something inside of them waited for this day and the prophet of God said that in the God is rich in Mercy Jesus said there's no man who can come to me except my father draws him first these were drawn something that could not they could not control I can see their wives maybe their children said you are crazy how would you your fellow brother disciples co-disciples left what are you still hanging on to that person they could not explain it they had to be there and he said God has to do the drawing that has there has to be a life and all that he has given me will come to me he made a provision for those who want to be redeemed these two were to be redeemed even when John was decreasing so Christ could increase they were redeemed and because they were the redeemed in them there was a seed of redemption God made a provision for them I like how the prophet of God puts this in the in the adoption he said here is the way they tried to make it God said well there's a lot of people lost I want them to be saved so I will send Jesus down in perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry some people think that by making a movie showing The Passion of Christ we have heard it or in in Years Gone by or you you tell the story the denomination can tell you the story of how cruel the death of Christ is and you can feel the pity you feel the sorrow but it's not by that you come to Christ it's not by that by the feeling the emotion how painful it has been on him to take my life it has nothing to do with it and the prophet of God clarifies that here and know that I've done so so I will send Jesus down in perhaps maybe somebody feels sorry and know that I've done and get saved all Mercy I wouldn't run my my office like that even as poor as I do run it sometimes I wouldn't do it like that God by his foreknowledge oh praise be to God wouldn't you say Amen would you see me scream about that God by his foreknowledge seen exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved a security again it's a security it's not how much you they can tell you how how Jesus Christ just was so horribly beaten on the cross you might be standing there not feeling no emotions but deep inside there is a seed to be redeemed he's going to redeem you it's not based on emotions He sent Jesus to save those that he had already chosen oh brother my that puts me to rest brother that puts me to rest he said he chose us in him before there even was a world that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price he sh his shedding of the blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do nothing he did it and he keeps on he said for he that sin willfully after receiving the knowledge the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice and he clarified it he said who had received the knowledge of the truth they never received the truth because they just received the knowledge of it then you can be tempted even to sin willfully when you only have a knowledge of it see it's impossible for those who are once enlightened and made partakers of Holy Ghost tasted the power of God because they are the truth themselves so coming back to little our little reading here I don't know how the time goes on so I'm gonna stop somewhere but we're coming back to now the main the main our main subject now Christ Jesus is turning the man who's been pointed to them as the Lamb of God asking what do you seek what's seeketh thou they say where do I what do you dwell and we will read that in 40 now let's start at 39 he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt if they only needed to see where he'd work that would satisfy them because they saw where he dwelt and Abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour one of the two which heard John speaking follow him was Andrew followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first finds his brother Simon in saith unto him we have found where he dwelt did I read that correctly no he first finds his own brother Simon and said unto him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ that was exactly the answer to their question to their seeking and by the word dwelleth in Greek it's a primary verb it tells us to abide to stay in a given place a given state also in the same Greek it means to stay in a relationship who stays in a relationship with you who are you related to that's their question who are you related to you are a man we know your second cousin to John John is pointing to you that you are the lamb Master could you clarify that who are you related to who is in a union with you who can testify of you the prophet of God said that in in God's only provided place of worship throw the edges many has sought to for this this secret place of God through all the ages even a job wanted to know where he lived job looked for that dwelling place too if I could only go to his house and knock at his door but the prophet of God slips in something very important he said job wanted to find God's Dwelling Place because there God and his family is worshiped together whoa their god with his family is worshiped together that's the only place that this great trillions Cycles a lifetime and his children can worship together and that's only in Christ their questions was they were seeking for Christ for seeking for somebody who can be the bridge between this great mysterious God and man worshiped together and Jesus told them come and see and the prophet of God said these are two when the veil was lifted after finding the place he was dwelling it wasn't too much they were poor the Bible 53 Isaiah 53 describes it it wasn't even too much to look at so that when they found the place it was dwelling he couldn't even pay attention to it but once they are bowed with him something came open to them something the answer to their question brother Brahm says that every answer needs and must have and every every question must have an answer and what is the answer the answer is Christ in anything you have a question you have a question we've got only one answer the answer is always Christ the word the word of your day is answer to everything you ever have a question on CE you have Christ you've got all the questions answered in your life you've got all the questions answered oh the veil the prophet of God says in the unveiling of God he said the veil has been lifted off the word for those two disciples that veil was lifted then the kid could see Christ that's right it's revealed to babes it's lifted they see it that's right then it will be as once when you see when this Veil is taken off of the word the Traditions is taken off of the word as Jesus once said when you see me you see the father see God in his word is one not understand that slips down he said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if I do the works and I and my father are one and the prophet of God says when you see the word made manifest you have seen the father and the word manifestes Christ God because the word is the father the word is God and the word made manifest is God himself taking his own word in manifesting it among among believers now listen this is very critical everything is critical but listen to this he said nothing can make it live nothing can make the word of God live but believers just believers you're saying you say I'm a Believer but how can I how can the word of God can I make the word of God live in my life because it says nothing else can make it live but believers just believers now listen to what the prophet God says in calling Jesus on the scene 63. God created the winds you still have that question hanging in your mind right how can I make the word of God believe uh make it live I'm a Believer I've been believing this message I've been trying my best to do it how can I make it live the prophet of God will give us an answer he said God created the winds and the waves if other things had to obey him and he was the creator would not the winds and the waves have to obey him also notice let us remember he also created our bodies oh he's coming closer to us I answer our question he also created our bodies and want our bodies have to obey him meaning for the word his word can only be made life through Believers just believers and Believers have bodies we are bodies said and want our bodies have to obey him he's giving us the key now you surrender your thoughts to him want to make the word of God live make it live nothing else can make it live but Believers just believers and Believers have the desire for God to make his word live and he's giving us the way you surrender your thoughts to him Surrender Your Life to him those sleeping deacons would you help us maybe name all those that have been sleeping I see I'm gonna call you by name you surrender your thoughts to him Surrender Your Life to him Surrender Your Faith to him and watch that body obey what he says oh brother this is powerful because you're not going to strive anything you just give your thoughts to him just just do what the prophet has told you to do it's not you're not pushing or shoving or are we going to do this no surrender your thought to him Surrender Your Life to him Surrender Your Faith to him take your hands off and you'll watch him and you're watching just do those three and set quiet because of faith I looked up the word faith in in the Hebrews face means something that's permanent it's quiet can remember Moses in the before uh these magicians he put out his uh his Rod there turns into serpents they did this very same well Moses to do Faith had to keep him quiet faith is permanent and just give him those three your thought thoughts your life and your faith take your hands off new watch can fold your hands and watch him and watch that body obey what he says he will make that body come back in subjection to the word yes sir but you've got to surrender it to him you've got to believe him he made our bodies they obey him he they obey his will also do you believe that if you are a Christian you have to that's why the prophet is saying if you are a Christian you have it there's no other way around always been commissioned brother it's sorry that many things going through my mind here but you know he doesn't need your abilities no no he does not he does not need your abilities I'm going to tell you I'm gonna the prophet of God is going to tell us what our abilities could do in life it's the message and the perfect strength by Perfect weakness in 61. the prophet of God is telling us speaking about Moses he said Moses seeing the need of the Dead this was a need not something that Moses imagined the need was there and you will see that it was the will of God Moses seeing the need of the day with his intellectual powers and his ability that he had to do with he was a smart man excuse me he was the coming pharaoh he had psychology he had physical strength he had everything so he said I'm well equipped I know all of it and if there's a man in the land that that's able to do it I am Moses had those so I'm the man of the hour so I will step out and he went out to accomplish a work that was right this work was right there was a need for the day they were in slavery the word of God was to be fulfilled after 400 years plus that was to be fulfilling that and the need was there a real need from God the work was right and in the will of God he went out to accomplish a work that was right and in the will of God and he offered his natural abilities and listen what God did with his natural abilities the same way he did with his he will do with yours and mine and God refused it he couldn't use one thing that Moses had forgot so goodbye my ability he couldn't use one thing that Moses had he couldn't use it then neither can he use it now God cannot use our natural abilities for my natural abilities brother Gardner knows I have three degenerated discs I cannot stand for more than 30 minutes for if I counted my ability I could not be standing here and it's amazing that if I send more than 30 minutes because I'm checking that they can give me some injection in my back glad to see sister Bob how you doing sister Barb much better wonderful so it's when [Music] we're giving this body maybe the service preaching I can go for four hours I don't feel anything right now I'm feeling nothing if it was for my abilities I cannot stand here and he said he couldn't use it then neither can he use it now God cannot use our natural abilities we've got to get ourselves and our abilities out of the way and surrender to the will and the power of God now we're coming back to these two disciples we're back and forth they are finding the very thing they were seeking after that was who was that man related to there was something about him who was who was inside of him or which state was he in they couldn't get put it together but after they Abode with him they found out that he was the Messiah he was the Christ and then the prophet of God when what is the messiah what is Christ let's let's take the prophet's work in the possessing the enemies gave the prophet of God said now remember he was the son of God when he was born he was God's virgin born son but when he became Messiah Jesus was born a Son of God but he was not born the Messiah he had to become the Messiah because the indwelling the anointing of God Messiah means the anointed one he had to come upon him he had to come God provided himself a body on Earth but that deity had to come together and dwell in the fullness of it he become Messiah that's when the Holy Spirit Come on him cause the Messiah means of the anointed one see and he was the anointed one when the Holy Spirit came on him oh brother when the Holy Spirit comes on you brother it's Christ in Christ there's only two portions you can the anointed anointing alone is not Christ it has to be a counter body here there too you can look you see a man and someone look and see God he said remember my message on Messiahs you see you are the word Messiah means the anointed one the anointed one if now you are if you have the Holy Spirit that's the prophet saying it you'll become the anointed one what does it make you it's not you alone it's Christ in you that's the Messiah it's that combo of you and him being one that combo is Christ is the anointed one he said give me a church in the hood you say this is give me a church that's so completely Anointed with God till their every action and move is thus saith the Lord walk in that kind of Glory I will show you a messiah a church could be a messiah when she is one with the anointed with Christ feet so if he sent his son like that Jesus Christ in whom he the fullness dwell he's going to be sending us the same way John 17 18 to 22 in 2019 is thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself what they that they also might that they also might be Sanctified through the truth reading this in the book of Ephesians because the prophet of God said that we are Sanctified to be filled when God is Not sanctify us just to let us be in clean no we are being Sanctified for a purpose and that purpose is to be filled God sent his son the same way and his son Sanctified himself for the fullness of his father could dwell in him now Jesus is sending us the same way he Sanctified himself and now we're coming so we can be filled with his fullness Ephesians 3 14 through 19 said for this cause I bow my knees and to the father of our Lord Jesus of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you this is Paul telling he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in the in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints not him alone he wants All Saints in that body dwelling in Christ what is the bread the length the depth and height and to know the love of Christ the love of Christ is greater than we ever even thought and to know the love of Christ which passes the knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God God is not saying hey you just have a portion of me his desire is for you to be filled with everything he has ever been what love he's giving himself totally not a portion the fullness in this generation you can have that fullness of God dwelling within you is what time is a slipping way in the message Oneness the prophet of God said if he abide in me Jesus saying and my word in you you can ask what you will now listen to what God wants you to ask him what you will just thinking about little things God wants you to ask for the creative things he said if I abide in me if he abide in me my word in you what is it you've got to get with the word get yourself killed now I'm I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough Holy Ghost enough said we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants you not enough Holy Spirit brother we could have enough Holy Spirit you know what I go to work I come here Wednesday and Sunday I show up and I'm believer I give my tithe my family is in order I do everything I go I'm not watching TVs I don't have that I'm misbelieving we can only have enough Holy Spirit he wants he said but God wants to fill every fiber of his church praise God every fiber he wants to feel your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just surrender in God's till his words just living right through you living right through you you don't know you don't know nothing else but God's word nothing else we want to know I know I have kids going to college sometimes they come into this is what college what college you know what is my mind saying that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie oh how did it go did you did you succeed it worked okay take it but you know what God's word is all it's going to fade away it's a lie it's a lie just stay right with the his word it is life my words are life Jesus said winding down in Christ is the mystery of God again he said what was Jesus manifested for that's the same way he he he's called you to be manifested the same in the same fashion Jesus was manifested to show God you are manifested in this generation to show God he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was he that was to come he that was he that is and he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose now I'm coming to your portion down I was talking about his son and through that purpose he achieved a church brother we have been achieved we are God's achievement [Music] brother we are God's achievement and through that purpose he achieved the church that he God the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days these last days every promise he has ever given there's an achievement on Earth to fulfill every one of them you know he wouldn't do any better if you tell somebody that I am I am the bride of Christ there's no there's no effect to that the effect will be when they look into the Bible where it's talking about the church and they see a person standing the characteristics are the same John the Baptist could not tell him he would not help them or I'm a Christ I'm a prophet I'm a liar no I am that word there that voice you see there I am that voice I'm one with it said that he might bring to pass every promised word of God in this last day when he gets preeminence in the church the position his place in the church his place in the church what is his place in the church and who is he the fullness the fullness it won't be robbery when the church claims the fullness Jesus claims the fullness no there's no robbery of God there it's exactly the same thing he gets preeminist his position Jesus said he that believe on me the works that I do shall he also even more than this shall he do he wants to get today and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word he said Jesus so it's so so seen it so was so perfectly born for the day until God's expressed every move that he made and God wants this church so filled with him that every move that this church makes it expressing him let us stand I had to cut it short in First Corinthians 3 16 17 is Paul said know ye not that ye are the temple of God in that the spirit of God dwelleth in you the prophet of God said in the stature of a perfect man now building a house you put your uprights and everything else brother woods and some of these carpenters and contractors they could tell you how to build your house see but I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house where God can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself like himself he wants you to be reflecting his being I like this prayer that we can close as the musicians would come Short Line that the prophet of God in the message a way to have Fellowship he's praying Softly saying Heavenly Father bless Thy word tonight and may to go out to every heart and find a Dwelling Place and never live no more his magician will sit play something Softly just by our heads the prayer his brother Chad can get ready to come precious Lord words a man can never

there's more to be had I want to receive it amen amen and how how do we get filled up we have less of ourselves Paul says I Die daily laid our life on the Altar and we thought that we died and we gave all and we did amen we did it was genuine it was heartfelt but the more the word unfolds the more we realize there's still a piece of self there and then we surrender to that and died of that and then as the word unfolds more we find other little pieces of self and I say God thank you for revealing all those little pieces of self so that I can die to that and surrender that to you and let the word take over and be filled with all the fullness of God that's what I want I want the indwelling of Christ not just enough I want all that he is allowed for this age which is fullness I want to open myself for all all that I can receive and I want to empty out of every hindrance that would hinder God I know you feel the same way I'm so thankful for God bringing a word like this to keep reminding us and keep showing us hey this is the day this is the hour don't stop now we're not finished amen there's more to be had we can still grow and what God has given us I'm so excited so excited that the

would encourage Us by your word that you would give us instruction and righteousness and Lord you have done all of that this morning God I'm so thankful that I can say you've been faithful to your word and God my greatest desire is to be found faithful that I can be faithful by my own choosing Lord that I can surrender you've already made your choice Lord and you chose me and I believe that by faith now I want to make you my choice and I want to choose you Lord and I want to surrender all of self to you I pray God that you would help us to surrender more that as we surrender may you come and fill up those places in our lives may you dwell in Us in fullness God may you accomplish your great purpose in this time to have absolute preeminence in a body of Believers and may we be part of that body of Believers and may you find your way day by day in a greater preeminence under our surrender may you come to a perfect preeminence in each one of us Lord God that's what we're striving for help us Lord we thank you for the word may it be applied to us Lord personally we thank you for our brother Emmanuel the vessel that you chose to use this morning may you replenish all that he's given
