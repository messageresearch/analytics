========================================

we believe we've seen the wave Chief in our day amen the same son of man was waved again it wasn't brother random wasn't the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man so where was the son of man he was being revealed in a son of man amen and that a son of man was being waved over because the son of man had come to maturity in a son of man amen and so now we saw it I mean we saw it clearly on display without mistake I mean so Vindicated and so proven by God so now we've seen that so what does that mean what is that what does that actually mean it means thank God it's Harvest Time thank God whatever happened to that first part is happening to the rest of us the every other part of the Bride field that's laying there this wheat plant this field that's got to come to harvest maturity at the end time whatever happened to that first part is the same thing that's happening to us that was a sign that the whole field is coming to harvest maturity not maybe not hope so but it's a sign that whatever brought this to maturity is going to bring the rest of it to maturity it's it's a Thanksgiving amen and so now when we see that Ministry when we see that life when we see that level of consecration that level of obedience that that manifestation uh of the word and the gifts of the Spirit and the the life of the spirit amen operating in that man it's not so that we can stand there and say oh what a man that was I mean that's our that's our reaction we appreciate and value what that was but if we just fixate on what was being waived we missed the whole point of it being waived because the whole point of the waving was that I can have absolute confidence in God that if God could take that part to maturity he can take me to maturity amen and he's already working the process because this is Harvest Time [Music] this is the the whole point of the sign that's been waived at the end time and the Messianic sign that's been shown in the Life of Christ on display through human flesh the whole point of that was not so that we can memorialize that and remember what was done so but that would give us Faith to recognize that all I need to do is lay in the presence of this Jesus Christ that has returned to his church and it'll bring me to the same Harvest maturity I'm on that same road I'm to that same destination that is my goal not not something I idolize but something I'm pointed to something that I'm that's showing me the way to walk in the direction I'm walking and the goal the place that I am coming to is that maturity how do you know there's already been a Thanksgiving wave and it's already been a sign believing that the rest of them is going to come
