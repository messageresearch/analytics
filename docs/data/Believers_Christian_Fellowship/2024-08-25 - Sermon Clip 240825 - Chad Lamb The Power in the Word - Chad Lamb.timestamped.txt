[0:00] that's why our confidence is what God's
[0:03] done not what we're
[0:06] doing what God's
[0:08] done this is something that I have to
[0:11] constantly remind myself because you
[0:13] know we as human beings we get
[0:14] passionate about things and I'm I'm
[0:17] truly passionate about this message but
[0:20] my personal passion in the message can
[0:22] move me amen Beyond uh certain barriers
[0:26] and trying to press and trying to push
[0:28] or trying to conjure something up make
[0:30] something happen or push something
[0:31] before it's time or persuade or push
[0:34] people into a certain
[0:37] Conformity amen amen and and and that's
[0:41] one of the errors that we can make as
[0:42] people it's one of the errors we can
[0:44] make make as ministers is that we're
[0:46] trying Amen to use our passion amen and
[0:49] our Force to produce something in the
[0:51] kingdom of God but God has his own
[0:53] method for producing something he sent
[0:55] his word amen that's his method and if
[0:57] I've Got Confidence in the word he sent
[1:00] that word's not going to return into him
[1:01] void he doesn't need me to apply extra
[1:04] pressure all I need to do is preach the
[1:06] word and let the word take effect cuz
[1:07] the word will take effect
[1:10] am amen and and I don't say that to
[1:13] condemn any preaching style because we
[1:15] absolutely understand God calls
[1:16] different men for different things and
[1:18] every once in a while we need somebody
[1:20] amen who has the ability to call call us
[1:22] on the carpet and call us to question
[1:24] amen but that's not what I'm saying what
[1:26] I'm saying is I don't need to do
[1:28] something to make the the word take
[1:30] effect in your life all that I've got to
[1:32] do is proclaim the truth that he's
[1:34] proclaimed to me and if it's the true
[1:35] word of God it'll have the life of the
[1:37] word inside of it and it'll bring life
[1:39] out of you if you've got a seat of God I
[1:42] don't need to use my personality I don't
[1:45] need to use a church discipline I don't
[1:47] need to use peer pressure we don't need
[1:49] to use guilt trips we don't need to use
[1:51] anything to get the word to produce all
[1:53] we need to do is preach the word keep it
[1:56] as true as we know how to keep it keep
[1:58] ourselves out of the way as much as we
[2:00] know how to keep ourselves out of the
[2:01] way and if we can do that that word's
[2:04] going to produce the results and it
[2:05] doesn't matter if you say it in a
[2:07] whisper or you say it at the top of your
[2:08] voice it's not the inflection of your
[2:10] voice or the volume that you say it with
[2:12] it's not how dynamic or how boring it's
[2:15] the power of the spoken word it's the
[2:17] foolishness of preaching it's God's
[2:19] Method All We've got to do is have
[2:21] confidence in God's method and let the
[2:23] word do the
[2:25] work oh I'm more convinced than ever and
[2:28] I Don't Preach that to you I preach that
[2:29] to me because sometimes I feel
[2:31] constrained I see things that aren't
[2:33] lined up and I got we got to fix this we
[2:35] got to fix that and I stay awake at
[2:37] night sometimes wondering what should we
[2:38] do about this situation or that
[2:40] situation and I've come to terms with
[2:42] myself that there's nothing that I have
[2:44] the power to do it's the power is in the
[2:49] word you got to preach the word
