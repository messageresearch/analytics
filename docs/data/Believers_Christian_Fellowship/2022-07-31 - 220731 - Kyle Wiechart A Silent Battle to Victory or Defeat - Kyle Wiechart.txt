lord this day you've ordained it lord you've ordained you've guided my mind you've anointed me in such a way but lord ultimately lord i don't know how to help your people but i believe you're here i believe lord you'd promise wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i'll be in the midst and lord you choose unlikely unworthy insufficient vessels to speak your word so father god i'm trusting in that now speak to all of us lord strengthen us this day lord may we say that it was good to walk with you today lord we sure love you and we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen amen god bless you all musicians thank you good to see you all today i'd like to have you turn in your bibles to isaiah 14. forgive me it has been a little bit since i've been up here so it's like i gotta get a rhythm here so i apologize i'm so used to speaking at my own home in the comfort of right in front of my own fireplace and talk to the youth and so it's just a little bit more intimidating here in this spot it's always an honor and a privilege and also scary as i'll get out to know that i have to come and it's not so much what scares me always is am i going to be saying the thing that you'd want me to say lord that's what always scares me because i just want to be able to find his will find his mind i don't certainly want to establish my thoughts in your lives i want the word of god established in your lives and and before i begin i just wanted to say also i've been really blessed by the minister that have been able to come through it was a while since we've had that many ministers back to back to back and it was a real honor and a real privilege to be able to see them follow the leadership of the lord and just speak to our hearts speak to our needs and also to see the leadership of the lord and brother chad as he's been ministering i believe to all of us in such a special way and he certainly has been to me as well and i really honored brother to have you as a brother and as a friend and as my pastor and how many appreciate him as your pastor okay there you go brother chad next time the devil says nobody loves you what was that how many people love brother chad okay record that brother franco sent it so it's an honor so i am have a thought it's been in my mind for a little while i had just ministered it this last week to the youth and then brother chad asked me wednesday night and i began to scramble looking for another thought i'm like it's okay to bring that to the youth but how do i bring it to you all you know but it's like anything else if he doesn't let you go anywhere then you better just say what he wants you to say if you will turn in your bibles to isaiah 14 chapter 14 verse 12. isaiah chapter 14 verse 12. let us begin how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weakest the nations for thou has said in thine heart i want to bring attention to that for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend unto heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god and i will sit upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds and i will be like the most high turn now to ezekiel 28. ezekiel 28 14. say amen when you're there thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled thee with in the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the oak covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thine beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground and i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee just ask prayer one more time lord take the word take the vessel take both speaker in here lord and minister unto yourself lord we love you we thank you we commit ourselves to you now in jesus name amen you may be seated um i'd like to read another scripture verse for you let's find my comfort zone second corinthians chapters 10 verse 3 says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they are mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of christ we are at war everyone congratulations welcome uh boot camp is over and now you're fighting the greatest battle that's ever been fought and there's not a one of us that isn't fighting the battle you know brother brian if you came in today with a black eye and a bloody lip and uh ripped up shirt we'd say that brother had a rough time getting here this morning and we wouldn't believe it was sister anna never we would believe this brother really got into quite a battle on the way here and that's obvious because we all could see that we could all know that but many times that's not the battle we're fighting in this day that's not where the battle is raging that's not the difficulty that's not the problem we are living in satan's eden and the devil's been studying this and he's been bringing up his tactics he's been studying humankind he's been studying you since you were born he knows the weak spots of your life and he's going to hit you each and every time in that weak spot the devil is a powerful being i have never liked and i do not think it's right to ever minimize him as a powerful foe he is not some pushover it would not speak to god's glory to make an enemy that wasn't a worthy opponent we have a worthy opponent that's why in the bible he says michael not bringing a railing accusation against him he just said the lord rebuke you and so today i'm not bringing a railing accusation against this worthy opponent i'm just saying by the word of god and the authority of god we rebuke you in the name of jesus christ you have given us a shield and a sword to combat you we're not looking at the strength of our arms we're looking at what god has equipped us with to fight this great battle and this title that came to my mind this is just a sentence that came to my mind a few weeks ago and it was the silent battle to victory or defeat a silent battle to victory or defeat and i want to take some time if that's okay i i'm not one that usually has a lot of notes you all know me enough by now but by the time i got done i had 10 pages and um and i i was a little surprised so and yeah so so i have some things i want to say and i'm going to lay some background i'm going to lay some foundation and i'm going to give some examples if that's okay just like if uh if we could see so many times we could see that um you know someone that's sick uh brother uh brother juan right god blessed you and he raised you brought you up out of the hospital for the glory of god and we can see that we can recognize that we can be in prayer for our brother because we can see the ailment we can go to a physical hospital and we can and we can pray for the brother but how often do we recognize the spiritual wounds and the heartache and the breakness in a spirit realm of an individual how often do we recognize that we don't know it because we can't see it but it's as real as ever and that's where the battles are really won and that's where the battles are really lost in the mind it's in your mind you know these things but oftentimes we stand here as if oh it doesn't matter it's not a big deal oh it matters and it's a big big deal you think the devil is going to just all of a sudden come to you one day and just oh just deny the message deny the word no he don't work that way he's too slick he's really slick he's really smart he knows exactly how to just keep throwing out a word here and there throwing out a word see if you're going to grab it capture it take a hold of it and cast it away or if you're just going to meditate on it just a little bit just begin to consider it oh my that isn't a bad thought you know that's how he caught captured eve he was there with eve and he just you know gained a buddy buddy with him you know talk to him a little bit became friends with her and before long he just you know just threw out a little word and just a slight perversion to it to see what she would do instead of quickly turning and say no that's not what god said i'm going back to my husband adam she began to entertain that thought a little too long and that thought began to take root in her mind and brother branham said she didn't commit natural dog treats she committed spiritual adultery when she forsook the word of god and she listened to a perverted word of the devil she opened up the womb of her mind and brought forth a perversion there's where the battle started there's where the battle was lost it wasn't lost in the physical act it was lost in the mind she opened up the womb of her mind and there she lost the victory and that's where you lose your victory that's where i lose my victory that's where the devil attacks us he begins to sow those little seeds of compromise those little seeds of perversion to the word of god and the promise of god to this hour he said he'd be for me he said i'll never leave you nor forsake it you believe that you say well i believe he'll never leave them or he'll never believe those but how will he leave me i don't know maybe he will no no no that's not reading your name into it that doesn't sound like a rock that you're standing on it sounds like a rock that somebody else is standing on that's told you about what they're standing on but it doesn't sound like the rock you're standing on he gave me a place that i can stand so i'd like to take some some time and let's look at this second corinthians 11 2. so you know paul became very concerned very nervous about that subtle enemy he said for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband the word then i may present you as a chaste virgin this is what he was trying to do with eve this is what he was trying to do with the early church but he found she became perverted the devil got to her first but god is watching over a people she's not going to be perverted she's going to keep herself in a virgin state only to the word and to the word only he says i fear lest by the means of the serpent beguiled eve through his substility except through his subtility so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is christ you see the devil's so slick he's so sly he's working angles and you don't even realize it every day of every hour he's watching you seeing if you're standing on the word right or if you're compromising by reasoning affections memories bringing back the old memories of things that are contrary to the word of god what are you going to do with it you're going to take a hold of it you're going to cast it aside affections for the things of this world what do you do with it contrary to the word and will of god for your life what do you do with it do you entertain it do you let it take root in the womb of your mind because i promise you the battle is won and lost there it's always won and lost there i can show it to you in almost every type in the bible the battle is lost right there first peter 5 says be sober be vigilant the adversary the devil goeth about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour with one objective kill you spiritually kill you if he can do it the greatest battle ever fought we know that the original sin was not in the garden of eden original sin started in heaven lucifer got lifted up in his own beauty and in his heart he never said it out loud in his heart he said i will ascend i will do this i will do that i'm going to leave my position that god has placed me because i will i'm a little better than that i can do a little more than that i can be in a better position i can do i could i could do it better than god could do it uh-oh you think you can do something better than the way god has done it no sir let's bring it home a little bit do you think god has set things in order the way they ought to be do you think all things are working together for the good to them that are that love god yeah you believe you have the right parents god said them so you believe you have the right brothers and the right brothers and sisters sitting in the church with you today do you think the wrong ones are there do you think the wrong persons are in offices who are you are you god you're not god we know that all things are working together for the good of god don't let the devil throw a seed a little seed of discrepancy in your mind you start to say well that's off and that's wrong and that's wrong they shouldn't be here that shouldn't be doing this nonsense god hath thus said it so god has ordained it so god put these things the way they are so if you have an issue with that you better say lord help me to understand because i just don't understand but don't try to figure it out i trust you god i believe you we're not always supposed to figure things out and try to understand why people do the things they do we're just supposed to believe god and say god's going to work it out for the glory god knows what he's doing god knows what he's doing in that one god knows what he's doing in this one god even knows what he's doing in me how many have looked at your own life say lord i do not understand me thank you i'm not the only one there was about four people in here that are humble enough to admit you don't understand you i don't understand me i've been frustrated with me for 38 years well i can't i was four years old you know what are you going to do in your 40s i don't like me no as long as i can remember i've been frustrated with me i've got weaknesses i've got complexes you've got them too we all got them and you need them little do you know you need them those weaknesses are going to make way for the strength of god to be your satisfying portion and your shield and your buckler when you need it ain't that something even your weaknesses are working out for the glory of god it's like uh you know brother ahri was talking about them stones right and a sculptor a great master sculptor he'd take a stone you ever i i know at the fair here they have that man that comes with the chainsaw you've probably all seen him and he he'll shape a piece of wood and make like an owl or an eagle or a wolf or and he just shapes it away but not every single block of wood that he chooses is the same some of them have big old knots on the side here and one have a limb out here and they say well what's the purpose in that you know why they should all be just exactly the same you know god don't make cookie cutter christians we're all different we're all stones a little bit different with each other but the kicker of it is in the mind of that sculptor he had to have that kick out part that part that kind of goes off this way it's a little oddball right a little bit strange he's like tilted this way but in the mind of the the carver he knows what he's got to do that has to be there so that when he cuts it the right way it'll bring into view his masterpiece and so are you you say i don't like this about me i'm i'm oblong i can't be like this brother this no you're exactly the way you have to be for the sculptor to bring in to view his masterpiece it has to be that way you have to be that way not that god's going to leave it there no he's going to cut it away a little bit he's going to shape it he's going to mold it and bring into view the thing he wanted everybody to see ain't that something god has a purpose in these things god has a plan in every one of your weaknesses it's a wonderful thing but also the devil knows these weaknesses too now with these weaknesses you have one of two things you can take the word of god and say i'm fearfully and wonderfully made god made me this way to serve his purpose or with that same weakness you can create a complex and say nobody wants me nobody needs me i can't do it i can't make it i can't do it and the devil begins to hit that weak spot boom boom boom boom wearing you out wearing you out seeing what you'll do the greatest battle ever fought this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate in earth it originated in heaven and when it was and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and it fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that was his purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and it begins in us and it's been raging ever since so the greatest battle ever been fought you know this it's right here isn't it interesting in the building of the statue of a perfect man we know what god has been doing he established us upon the foundation of the apostle apostle paul so building up his great masterpiece he set it upon the feet right and then he raised up ireneus and martin and columba and they stood upon that foundation and the body's coming into view and he brought it up through luther and brought it out to wesley the great missionary age he said and then it came up through the restoration of the gifts of the holy spirit to tongues and then he restored a prophet so we could see clearly but now where is it where's this great battle now and isn't it interesting in 1963 he signified his coming by the head coming and uniting with the body so the body has now been formed god must have seen something god must have been doing something god must be getting everything set and ready for the greatest of great battles that has ever been fought to go into view because look at this he says when that great battle started on earth there had been a mutual meeting place there had been a place selected for this battle to begin and the battle to rage and that battleground begins in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind is the chosen place for the battle it's where it will begin and it's where the decisions are made of you see from the head okay i don't i must have the wrong but brother ban makes the comet he says now god's been selecting some select soldiers some certain type of individuals you're not talking about you're just everyday soldiers not like your everyday marine no navy seal like right so you like say i wish i wasn't in this age i wish i was back 200 300 years ago no no no god must have been watching for some select soldiers the elites of the elite of the elite you may complain about the satan's eden that you're in but i promise you you were brought up to this day and this hour to defeat satan's eden this is the age for the overcomer you're not like everybody else this bride is not exactly like everybody else she is the elite of the elite and brother brown said that greatest battle that ever has been fought is getting ready to go into array now hold on it struck me when i heard that i said now hold on i thought the greatest battle that's ever been thought's been going on for 2000 years well the battle the mutual battleground in the mind that's been going on but the greatest battle that was ever to be fought is now ready to happen because god has brought into view his masterpiece god has equipped her god has revealed to her his secret she has his word she knows what he wants done with it she's fully equipped she's battle armored sword in the hand shield in the other helmet of salvation she's ready he's been getting her ready so you may complain about this foe you may complain about this satan's eden but don't complain you were rose up in this generation to destroy it just as samson was rose up in his generation to defeat the you know the philistines so have you you've been rose up for the same thing but how was samson defeated who defeated samson which philistine army overcame samson no army overcame sampson he got defeated here he put the words of a woman in his affections for that woman over the will in the word of god that had prophesied that he was rose up to destroy these philistines and he let the word take the words of this woman take preeminence in his life and he failed and lost the battle right there and that's where we fail and lose the battle when we take any other idea over the word of god then the lucifer has found his position and has exalted his throne above the stars of god you see it's very interesting now brother bam says in satan's eden there is a god of this world that i have preached to you about last sunday here he is today in deceit in this treacherous hour that tremendous time that we're living that it's the most glorious time of all the ages because we are facing the great millennium again we're facing eden again but right at this age all the deceit and every tactic that he has ever used and been able to deceive with he has gathered it all together he has reinforced himself and he's come down like god and has put himself in the place of god religious and can quote the scripture and can tell you scriptures just as satan did to eve in the garden of eden but he'll leave out one spot of it that's all he has to do he just makes a little gap where the poison doctrine of the devil can be poured in like that you see like the thinking man's filter that i was talking to you about the other day oh so there it is thinking man's filter where is this filter where must it be put in its proper place at you know it's everything's got to run through the will and word of god in our minds casting down imaginations in every high thing that would exalted itself above the word and will of god for your life now he said he would exalt himself and be above the most high he would ascend above the clouds of the stars he would sit there like god and be above the most high he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by listen by the people letting him explain away in every age the value of god's promised word to that age that's exactly how he has done it in every age he explains it away my through human reasoning through human affections but remember everything's trying to get you back to the control tower back to the soul level where there's either faith or doubt in the word of god everything's probing everything's coming through the imagination conscience reasoning affections memories see taste feel smell in here everything's probing where's the weak spot where's the weak spot where's the weak spot where can i get in boom boom boom boom i got one he didn't cover this up with prayer he didn't deal with this he hasn't been able to put hold up the shield of faith in there and stop the fiery darts i got him boom there he got him so many times it's not just the physical things right brother one it's the spiritual things that are the problem we're not dealing with the spiritual gaps the spiritual sicknesses the spiritual wounds the spiritual scars haven't fully healed you know when there's a scar you don't keep it a big old bloody mess you get cut on something right and it's well walk around and play in the mud no you cover it up it'd be foolish to do such a thing so you better keep some things covered up you got some weak spots you have to keep them covered up you have to overcome you have to do what god told you to do see it's like so basic but you know what i'm saying is true and you know you haven't done that sometimes i know i haven't am i right say amen if i'm right okay well not me that i'm right god's word's right i'm not right now i'm just a nobody in here so we got to keep some things covered eve did not want to do that he showed her how it was more wisdom and and she didn't know she wanted to know she didn't understand but she wanted to understand and god told her not to try to understand how can i understand all of these things i cannot understand all of these things i believe them i don't have to understand them god is faith not understanding we just believe what he said okay so how many of you have not understood something that has taken place in your life that has created a scar or a weak spot and you tried to figure it out and then you got discouraged and dismayed and down and out brother shay's the only one i'll be with you brother i might okay brother okay so we've got a few more you tried to figure something out about your own life or the circumstances of your own life and the situations you went through why things happen when you were young why this happened why'd this have to go that way you tried to figure it out you're not supposed to try to figure out why everything is all you need to know is god rescued you you're here today you're the seed laying in the presence of the sun god's ripening you what more do you need don't let the devil try to explain away the value of the word that has been given in this day and this age to bring you to your full harvest maturity god isn't playing around this is a big deal this is not something we are taking lightly this message is not to be taken lightly this isn't just some random thoughts spoken by a kentucky born boy no this is the mind of god coming down and calling you as the light for this hour to quicken the seed to its full harvest maturity to bring those navy seals into view to fight the greatest battle that's ever been fought today and it's all happening in your mind and what you're doing what you're thinking about what you're uh pushing away are you satisfied with the word are you sufficiently impressed with what he is doing are you trying to figure it all out and say well that one shouldn't be there this one shouldn't be here that guy is not right this one's not right oh well if he should have done just say devil get out of here that's not right everything is working for the good eve and that spiritual womb the battle rage when eve opened up her mind and she began listening through her reasoning that was the flu that it came in it came in through a channel and run down through reasoning down to her soul her eyes her eyes of sight she saw that serpent he was a beautiful handsome far better than her husband he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field and he was probably fairer than her husband he looked like a great big masculine beast standing out there how great he was he was trying to tell her all these great things and the first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasoning caught it and so first it hit satan hit eve's mind and in the womb there of her mind she doubted god's word and then come the act so you've never fallen into sin by accident you've never just done something wrong no i promise you you put aside the word of god first you don't just make mistakes you lost the battle in your mind and then you went out and manifested or brought the physical act into view you don't a man just doesn't commit adultery no he opened up the womb of his mind to adulterous thoughts and he began to commit spiritual adultery in his mind he had to push aside the word of god and then he goes out and creates and messes up and does the act but he didn't that that act wasn't the mess up the the the sin was here sin started in heaven in heavenly places it started up there and then it brought down into these earthly battles to be fully manifested fully expressed but it all started up here okay these things don't just happen they don't you've been equipped you've been you've been you've been taught you've been well trained and now the battle is going into array in the beginning of the word the word was with god the word was god the word was in the guard was and the word was made manifested and it dwelt among us and right among us the word of god the spoken seed from the very garden of god when every seed was to bring forth of its own kind that's right when eve got perverted and got to listening to the lie of a devil and took the wrong seed into her womb of her soul to believe one word that was twisted see the devil's just not going to come and tell you something that's just a million miles from the truth that's not deceptive that is not deceptive at all he's going to come it's going to be 90 99 right it's going to look really good it's going to look that's just about right but he'll leave a gap one little gap tell you something 99 true with a gap and you inject that one little word and see what you do with it see what you do with it see if you'll grab it if you grab it uh oh a seed's going to take hold in the womb and you're going to begin to manifest unbelief amazing these little spots you okay keep going page three okay and so an army first and getting ready for a battle the first thing he's got to do is he's got to select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and i believe that the greatest battle that has ever fought is now ready to go into action i believe that god has been selecting his soldiers and i believe that he has been dressing them and training them and the battle and the battlefront is now set getting ready to start amen congratulations you're getting ready to start in the greatest battle that was ever fall see you had to you know it's um it was fitting to god to see to it that he would train like um with a father with the son he wants to um he'll raise him up in a certain way he'll teach him in a certain way he'll see that he can walk a certain way and walk without fall and then you know and he gets he gets to come like a soldier in the army you know you don't just take the first recruit on the first day and throw him on the front line no you're training you're getting ready you're equipping you're toughing him up you're getting mentally ready for the battle you're getting physically ready for the battle and then you fully equip him for the battle and that's what god's been doing to us he does the same way he gets you physically right he gets you spiritually right you're mentally right and then he equips you to have confidence in the things that you've been given to fight the enemy if a soldier goes to battle and he doesn't have confidence that his gun's going to fire when he's out there brother shea would you like to go on the the field without a gun that actually works in your pocket ain't no way in the world a police officer would want to go to battle without a gun that he's not sure about no he has to have confidence that weapons that he was issued are going to work and i have confidence that the word has been issued to me the sword of the spirit that's in the hand of in our hands by the faith of god it will work but if you don't believe it will work i promise you you won't pull the sword you'll use human reasoning understanding affections memories all kinds of things to get away from just using the thing god told you to use you won't speak the word you won't take the word because you don't have confidence in it somewhere along the line somebody told you you listened to a lie of the devil that caused unbelief something to sneak in and you no longer have confidence in the things of god or what god has given you see scars situations difficulties complexes disappointments all of these things creating unbelief and ultimately what is it trying to lead you to unbelief in god's word ultimately doubt that god is in control and gout god has equipped us and god is with us that's all it's trying to do the devil's slick very slick he knows what he's doing he knows how to get you um now he says now now remember it's not just christian science it's not just mind over matter the mind accepts the life which is the word of god and there it brings the life just your thought won't do it but the word of god thr word of god brought through the channel of your thoughts see that it's not the thought as christian science would make it mind over matter no that's not it but it's the mind accepts it it grasps it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the word and that's the thing that has the life in it and it brings the life into you oh brother what that when that takes place when life comes down through that channel into you by the word of god it will manifest in you oh my so god's going to have an elect bride without spot or wrinkle right and you look at yourself how many have me not the only one said how am i going to be that what he wants me to be i look at i says i can't physically do this and then i realize i have to look up a little higher you're right i cannot do it but if i set my sights upon him the word and i let that word come in and i accept that and believe that the word itself will produce the life not me i have nothing to produce i can't manufacture the life of jesus christ you can't either none of you can live this message as the message is christ it'll take christ in you to bring forth the manifested life of christ on this earth what do i have to do with it be it unto me according to thy word i have to stop everything that would try to exalt itself try to take a preeminence in my life everything you think it's by any accident that this is the day in the age where technology has advanced to a point where brother branham could stand in the jc penney's and say what those things were were in hell i saw sitting in jcpenney you think it's any accident that we now have technology at our fingertips that can literally bring fifth dimensional hellish type things into view and have a direct influence on you every day of your life in your pocket you think that's an accident you don't think the devil's been studying this for thousands of years and he says i can totally trip them up they cannot stop looking at these things they cannot stop overcoming these influences i've got them i've got the music i've got the the the the imagery the technology and i can give it to them every second of every day of every hour you think there's any accident now that we have a direct link to the fifth dimension by the fourth dimension technology and science satan eden is here it's at its apex and it's not something you better play around with joseph didn't play around with the woman that tried to deceive him he took off and ran the man ran but then we began to play with these things and not realize you know that's a direct thing that the devil's using to trip you up and to get you into a problem and it gets you starting to doubt the word of god and we say well it's not a big deal it's a big deal man i am not honestly i'm not sugar coating that stuff at all no way at all those things won't be there one of these days you ain't going to have a cell phone in the millennium i promise you it's not going to be there you're not going to have these influences all around you no the devil will be chained by a chain of circumstances i promise you you're not going to see those type of influences having its rampage no way no way so we better not take these things lightly the devil knows what he's doing and he's studying you and the thought came okay i gotta hurry up because i gotta get some other thoughts more exciting to me i'm sorry i gotta go um see it's your mind has to open that door or it closes that door it has to listen to your conscience it listens through your memories it listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself off to those things and let god the spirit of the word come in it will blow all the rest of that stuff out of there every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation and doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that he can whip you but he cannot whip god so the only thing you have to do in your weakness is take a hold of the word and then he fights the battle for you aren't you glad you can be honest enough and say i've you know oh remember brother chad you preached that sermon the secret invasion of the enemy's camp see little the devil doesn't understand weakness because he's perfect in beauty full of wisdom he's powerful he's created in such a way with onyx and bernacle and all these other things these beautiful stones he's amazing he's powerful he's perfect and then we behold jesus stricken smitten of god and cast down no beauty that we should behold him learning obedience through much suffering oh my isn't this interesting so the devil doesn't understand weakness so the devil doesn't understand how god could have a people be so weak and that weakness is actually the secret of their strength because they won't be relying upon their abilities they'll be putting their confidence in god and saying it's god that's going to do this in me it's not me i can't do it but god can do it and see this is that secret invasion of the enemy's camp that god is doing and god has let you see and now we know how to overcome so i want to use some examples and we'll take a little time i'll slow myself down if i can sorry the hebrew children now we all know that there was ten spies that went when they came out of egypt god delivered them by a mighty hand they brought him up to jericho and you can think about how they're going to think like god you delivered us from pharaoh you you you broke him and then you brought us out here to the red sea and you deliver us they complained the whole way you delivered us brought us through the red sea now you're bringing us up to jericho and now we see all these big giants in the way and they begin to doubt and remember it was ten spies see taste feel smell here imagination conscience reasoning affections you see ten it was ten spies that came with a lion report and said we cannot take it you know god did not have to allow there to be giants in that land but he did god was testing his children god was testing to see where is faith where can i find faith where are the people that won't be looking at the strength of their arms by looking at the promise of god that said i'm giving you this land this land belongs to you but see the devil began to sow and they began like brother bam said the devil has in every age begins to get you to doubt the promise of god's word for that age and the importance of it and the value of it so they saw the spies and became fearful and be and doubt snuck in they realized we can't take it because they weren't looking at the right things they kept looking around but joshua and caleb was there and a different spirit was upon them and they never looked at the strength of their arms they never considered their human weaknesses they had one thing down on the soul that was looking at one other thing the word of god that said we're more than able to take it now that's a story from thousands of years ago but it applies today you don't think god was allowing giants to come in the land confusing things difficult to understand obstacles in your way just to see will they take a hold of my word or will they doubt it it's a simple concept but this is the greatest battle that's ever been fought and it rages in you and it rages in me david now here's david so i want to talk about david's i'm gonna slow down talk about david's silent battle to victory and to defeat turn in your bibles to first samuel first samuel chapter 17. verse 33 first samuel chapter 17 verse 33 and saul said to david thou art not able to go against the philistine to fight with him there's your backslidden believer that sounds just like a backslidden believer we are unable to take it and who do you think you are that you could take it remember the backslidden believer's not that far away from you you have two-thirds of you that is a backslidden believer your two-thirds of you is of the devil itself and it's constantly there buffeting you saying hey david you're not able to defeat that philistine remember when you fell here remember when you don't worry your backslidden believer isn't the guy beside you it's the guy looks at you in the mirror reminds you of the things that you failed and then times gone past don't worry you get to take saul wherever you go but you don't have to listen to him for thou art but a youth and he is a as a man of war from his youth and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went after him and i smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by the beard and i smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seen he hath defied the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paul of the lion and out of the paul of the bear and out of the hand of the philistines or he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine david wasn't looking at his ability he's still a boy david was looking at the hand of god that had brought him through all these other things why would he not see the different spirit that was in david than was in the hebrew children then why couldn't they say the same god that brought you brought us out of the hand of pharaoh the same god that took us through the red sea the same god that could is the same god that can overcome here at jericho why couldn't they have that spirit because they couldn't they were unbelievers but unbelievers they just can't believe but believers we're called to believe no matter what the situation no matter what the circumstance no matter how big the giant doesn't matter it does not matter that's why brother bam said it does not matter what we overcome but how we overcome the what doesn't matter but the how that matters we overcome by the word and so david first overcame in his mind back there on the desert taking over the fields or whatnot taking care of his father's sheep just being faithful to do those things that god called him to do back there god was training his little warrior his little believer his soon to be king samuel had come chosen him said god's not looking on the outside god's looking on the heart there's something different about david and here comes david and god begins to train his soldier bringing him through certain things taking raising the strength from the bear to a lion how many times has god brought you from a bear to a lion he delivers you from one obstacle and you say god god praise god he delivered me then he braces the power of the obstacle a little bit more and you say well god praise god he deal with me and then he brings goliath you're like yeah i can't do it let's be honest this is truthful you know i'm right right he began to begin to sow those little seeds of doubt but david was looking at something and david was convinced that god was with him and he began to speak like a believer you know believers talk a certain way they don't just think a certain way they don't just say amen on church on monday through friday they talk different they don't talk like saul they talk like david david he's more than able i'm more than able he's with me he promised he'd never leave me he'd never forsake me it's not me it's the spirit of god that will deliver me from that obstacle it's not me it's not you it's him so believers just talk differently and then so he had this showdown then with philistine in first samuel it says and dave and and said david to the philistine thou cometh to me with the sword and with the spear and with the shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord god of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give and i will give the carcass of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts and of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel so it looks to me like david's thoughts began to express in his words that he was speaking and his words became manifested in what he then did but the battle was fought in the mind the battle was one in the mind david wasn't looking at himself he was looking at the promise of god and he overcame goliath in his mind not when he cut off his head with the sword that would soon come the manifestation of that creative thought would soon come into its existence but david here a son of god a little creator in and of himself he began to think the right things remembering he wasn't remembering bad things he was remembering the good things he was remembering the hand of god that delivered him all the other times and he began to have the right thinking the right memories coming into view then he began to talk like a believer he began to express the word with the mouth confession is made unto salvation right and began to say the right things and then he began to perform the right things see little creators on earth again greatest battle ever fought but the man says he had f-a-i-t-h in jesus j-e-s-u-s five rocks five stones one little stone in there and it started off with it started whirling around like this and that and the holy ghost got a hold of that rock and it went right and it went and away it went goliath went to the ground and that's the way it's done i love the simplicity that's found in christ it's so simple so humble it's not great it's not oh wow it's got to be amazing no it's so simple f-a-i-t-h in the promises of god's word knowing that i am his chosen david knew he was going to that throne who could stand in his way do you know where you're going do you believe the prophet like david had to have confidence in his prophet they called him out and said god's not looking at your outward parts god's looking at something he saw a little predestination of himself a seed gene of god down on the inside and as samuel came as a prophet anointed david and said you will be the next king of israel you are coming to that throne what confidence that must have had in david i wonder if it led i wonder if he thought about that you know as that bear came in looking at that line he's probably looking at himself saying that's a big bear that's that's a really big wow those teeth they're pretty big but he said you know what i remember samuel just the other day he anointed me and he called me out and god chose me and he's anointed me and i gotta come to that throne i wonder if he was thinking those things i wonder if those thoughts were going through his mind then he began to say you know what if god before me who could be against me come here bear and then the lion and then the philistine nothing could stop him nothing so in timothy second timothy we're gonna go a little turn second timothy verse 2 chapter 2 verse 3 says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier now i want to bring that into view because of some things we're going to look at in david and samson no soldier entangleth himself in the affairs of this life if you're a soldier you're commissioned to do a certain thing so you have to be focused on doing the right thing just the moment you forget that you're in a battle that's when he'll come just a moment when you're tired and weary and you just want to check out and relax that's when he'll come this is when it got david this is when it got samson you'll find they were both going to sleep they were both tired they were both weary and they were going to relax and then the defeat let's look at it ii samuel chapters 11 and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all of israel and they destroyed the children of amen and besieged rabban but david tarried still at jerusalem and it came to pass in an evening tide that david arose from his bed and walked upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was beautiful to look upon uh oh david you're in the wrong place at the wrong time at a time when kings are supposed to be out on the battlefield fighting not entangling themselves in the affairs of this life you're supposed to remember david you're supposed to be fighting and here you are lounging upon your bed just needing a break you think there's any reason why how many have said i'm just so tired all the time you get a good 10 hour sleep and i'm tired i'm exhausted you think there's any reason that you don't think the devil is trying to exhaust you and make you tired honestly brother man point blank said we were not created to live in an age like this it's too busy it's too constant it's too fast you're exhausted you're mentally worn out why is the devil trying to exhaust you he wants to put you to sleep put you on a bed get you out of fighting yeah so then i'm on the bed so i'll just scroll on the phone well i'll see what everybody's up to oh i'm just lying i'm so exhausted i'm so tired i need a break oh my yep i see what they're doing oh okay see what they you don't think the devil knows what he's doing you don't think he's slick man he is slick he is wait so he got you before he you think he got you he's very very slick so he's trying to exhaust you trying to make everyone tired mentally tired worn out need a break fried he knows what he's doing but our strength cometh from the lord we're not to be entertained by social media we're not to be entertained by knowing what everybody is doing who cares my goodness i have enough time trying to keep everything in order in my own life how in the world can i figure out what everybody else is doing i don't care about it don't tell me what you cook what you made what you've done i don't care nobody cares we don't have time for that it's wearing everybody out don't text me all the time about things you're doing i don't want to know if you ain't got time to spend with god you ain't got time to send a text out or go post your pictures of everybody of what you're doing that week don't do this stuff you don't think the devil knows what he's doing he's got you and you don't even realize it you're too tired to pray too tired to read your bible too tired to listen to message but i can spend four hours finding out what everybody's doing nonsense sorry wow this social media i'm telling you right now nonsense you have it if you want to but i'm telling you the devil knows how to wear you out mentally and spiritually wear you out he's working his trap he's going to set it he's going to set it so you have to be mindful of the tactics of the enemy remember thousands of years he's now brought it to his apex he's now got his soldiers and his equipment and his guns and his uh armaments he's got it all perfect man he's got every i mean he's got the ak-47 shooting 50 caliber bullets out of these things man he knows what he's doing where am i um okay yes at a time when kings go to battle yeah he's trying to wear you out make you tired okay but here's what you have to remember first thessalonians if you want to write it down you don't have to turn but first thessalonians chapters 5 remember this but ye brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken or drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet and the hope of salvation it looks like we are not to get tired and worn out and weary it looks like we are children of the light it is not a time for sleeping it is not a time to allow satan's eden to wear you out and dull your senses your spiritual senses to the things of god it's time to arise and shine our light came and the glory of the lord has risen upon me not just you it risen upon me so now the potentials of that little lily that was buried under the muck in the mud of your life in my life now it can come forth now that right light can come and pull out the life that he had down on the inside and bypass the complexes bypass the weaknesses bypass all that nonsense and filth of your life now is the time see it was just a betting ground anyhow your life was just the betting ground with the sea gene of god down on the inside just waiting for the right light to come to bring that life into view that's so exciting to me so david's mental silent battle when he overcame the lion the bear and the goliath brought that public or those private battles into a public victory right but then david's private thoughts his defeat alone upon his bed brought forth the public defeat in the ministry of david you could say you see what i'm saying and mine the whole battle was fought and finished right there now let's look at samson turn in your bibles to judges 15 14. samson born under a nazarite vow he was told to by his mother and never let a razor come to his head those seven little locks upon his head and you know as a kid i remember having the coloring books and we all used to look at the pictures of samson these massive huge muscles every kid wanted to be just like him but then the prophet of god brings it into view and says don't use a little shrimp of a fella he was a ruddy shrimp man because he said god would not share his glory with man it would be no great thing to see a man with the shoulders the size of a you know cadillac you know picking up barn doors and carrying an oil he said he was a shrimp you think he was made fun of i just hang with me do you think samson could have been made fun of do you think jesus could have been made fun of do you think brother branham was made fun of you don't think there's a pattern to these things you don't think that there could have been some things in brother branham's childhood that created a complex in him that made him feel inferior to everybody that was around him that would make him to go up on his tippy toes when he's standing beside oral roberts you don't think he had some scars some weaknesses some complexes some some fear inferiority complexes he sure did you think he was made fun of oh yeah he was even made fun of by his daddy he says oh i have some boys but one you don't think that had an effect on him you don't think that it carried those scars his whole life and god allowed it it would serve his purpose in the end but here's samson shrimp of a fella seven little fight locks the other band says on his head it was quite a fella to look at i just have a feeling he got picked on a couple times in the uh at gym class or whatever and it was probably very interesting time but i don't know maybe it created a complex or two maybe you know at the time he was a little shrimp of a fella all the other kids would make fun of him you know and all the girls he just also all the pretty girls maybe there was one of those girls there he really admired her she was nice and kind till one day she laughed at him man that made him angry i don't know about this rotten thing i don't know it happened to brother branham's life yeah a girl laughed at him left a complex created a situation in his life a little little thing he'd have to overcome in the conscious realm of his memory at certain date and time he'd have to plug those things up but here comes samson told don't ever touch those locks of hair but he found his weakness was women he found his weakness was coming under the influence and being admired by another woman because probably he was picked on that's just me i don't know i could be wrong about that but i have a i won't go into why but i just have a feeling and so he his weakness became something of he was looking for the admirations of another woman okay and as time went on he uh he he found the wrong woman that gave him the affections that he desired delilah and i want you to read in the bible here of judges 15 and when he had come to leia the philistines shouted against him and the spirit of lord was mighty upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax and that was that was burnt as fire and his bands loosed from his hands and he found the jaw bone of a of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men thereof and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jawl of an ass i slain a thousand men uh-oh he never acknowledged the spirit of god that was upon him he began to lift himself up in the situation and so something had began to start he started to see a little crack in the armor of samson something had caused him to want to exalt himself i wonder why why he needed to feel that he was doing something why did he need to have something to do in it why did he feel like i i i want to show everybody that i did this why couldn't he just say like david said the lord provided the lord spirit of god was upon him you see i bet there was a complex or two along the way i bet there was something that he was trying to compensate for a weakness of some sort and i think you can continue to see this if we turn to the next chapter judges 16 15 and she said unto him how can't thou say i love thee with thine heart when thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth and it come to pass when she pressed him daily with her words okay and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon my head for i have been a nazareth unto god from my mother's womb if i be shaven then my strength shall be gone shall go from me and i shall become weak and be like other men and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart see what were her words trying to get to her heart his heart always see this delilah that was the thing that could overcome samson the cares of this world the pleasures of this life you don't think the devil will use something that's maybe uh satisfies or gives a comfort to you a false comfort you don't think the devil could use those china things to woo you and slowly what's he after he's after your heart he's not after you just trying to mess up no he wants your heart he wants to kill you he wants to spiritually kill you and so he has certain words that have come through the mind and they're always trying to get your heart so samson began to take the words and the affections of this woman and exalt them above the will in the word of god see the very thing he was raised and raised up and anointed to do he was overcome by he was raised up to destroy the philistines and he was brought under captivity of a philistine woman you know you were raised up to destroy satan's eden you're on this earth to utterly destroy it and bring the the kingdom of devil of the devil down how are you being entertained by it why do we find ourselves being entertained by the very thing you were meant and brought to this earth to destroy you see i hope it's if i'm going long i'm sorry it's just a little quiet all of a sudden um so he says here and when delilah saw that he told all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up at once for he hath showed me all his heart and the lord of the philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand brother brandon made it very clear oh and she made verse 19 and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off his seven locks of head of her his head and began to afflict him and his strength went from him what did what did delilah do put him to sleep make him exhausted make him tired worn out physically gotta go to sleep see the pattern david and samson worn out exhausted i need a rest i need a break can't do it no more i'm tired i hope i'm not the only one that's like tired in this age i know i'm not because i hear everybody say it so all of it was trying to get to one thing everybody make you exhausted get you weak get you tired so wear you out with the words and the uh the little thoughts from delilah thoughts of this world thoughts of compromising along the way all in an attempt to cause and create doubt in your life where then you could give up the source of your strength which is the word of god and the promise of god's word for this age and the value of that promise and then strip you of your strength like any other man you know without the spirit of god you're no better than the most rot and sinful person on this earth you know that there is nothing in and of yourself you're a filthy rotten thing except it be for the spirit and grace of god upon your life makes you ought to make you walk very humbly because if he ever removes his spirit from your life you're done you'll be taken captive and stripped of everything you've got now let's look at another one shamgar shamgar won the battle shamgar had a great victory and it all happened in his mind and then he manifested it brother branham convinced and concerned shamgar many of you he was one of the judges of israel many ministers never even seen that in the bible but he was one of the judges of israel one little verse wrote about him but i like him he was a man after my heart you know the philistines then every man did what he wanted to do so he we find that in israel there was raised up that he the israelites had raised up a whole lot of crops and the philistines would set back over there gambled and let them slave for them and here they would walk right in no unity among them go right over there and say hey i'll take up those crops and year after year they did that this little old fella one day he wasn't a warrior one thing he he had was his crop and i imagine him standing there after putting away his crop in the barn he looked at his little ragged kids and his wife and she needed a dress and he just got all of it laid up real nice and he was sitting there leaning saying well maybe we can eat this winter he heard something and he looked out the window and there was coming a thousand philistines marching march march march great big plates of armor all over him well-trained men spears and their hands marching right up to take all that he had he looked down at his kids he looked over at his wife and he was concerned but what was he he was helpless he wasn't a swordsman no he didn't say now wait i better go up to the school now and learn how to duel and creeds if he would have done that he that's all he would have known about but here's one thing that he did know he happened to think he happened to think i was born an israelite and god's promise to abraham my father was that thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemy and that was enough amen so the battle when he defeated these i think 600 brother bam says a thousand philistines it all happened in his mind it wasn't physical the thought came through the right channel and faith rose up took a hold of that thought said i'm more than a conqueror thy seed shall possess the gates of thy enemy i find i'm a part of the right seed with the right promise who is this uncircumcised philistines coming my way you see the pattern just continues to go on now i want to bring another one into view jesus now his silent victory led to a victory for all of us and the greatest battle that was ever fought took place in the silence of gethsethme jesus in conferences 1960 jesus brought himself to a decision before going to calvary the broad the father brought his own son into a conference in gethsethamy while angels were taking their position to see what decision he would make oh it might not have been this way but let's just think about it i can hear them hear him say son do you desire to go to calvary there's a ban there waiting for you there's persecutions there's death there's murder laying on the way they're going to expose your body and they're going to strip your clothes off of you they're going to beat you to a pulp they'll pull the crown of thorns over your head and you will be screaming for mercy will you go on my what a decision how he was wrestling this out this battle this greatest battle calvary was calvary's victory took place in gethsethme that was just the manifestation of the overcoming that took place in gesethme in silence and in the battle of his own mind and so brother banham continues on he says in the breach and john started crying because no one was found worthy no one could even look at the book or take oh and take a human being john wept there was no one that could do it everything was lost and there came a voice from one of the elders standing in the midst of the four beasts and all the great host of heaven said don't weep john oh my the grace of god don't be brokenhearted john don't weep the lion of the tribe of judah hath prevailed the root and offspring of deva he prevailed which means he wrestled with and he overcome oh my in the garden of gethsethme when the blood dropped from his face he was overcoming the lion out of the root of david had prevailed and had overcome brother branham said this is the most sublime scripture in all the bible when real strength prevailed in weakness of a man that was overcoming in his mind and then he could get the victory for us all so his private victory in his mind brought a public victory for you and me don't ever let that go to get pushed off to the side don't let that become a little thing for you my goodness that was quite a battle he ra he fought and he did it for me and he did it for you spiritual amnesia he says now i was with oh so this is what i want to bring into view brother branham says now to be an american he says i have to uh i have to uh i was with george washington when he crossed the delaware he said to be an american i have to be identified with an american he says oh he bros up all those americans and he says you know i was with david when he overcame goliath he said i was there he said you know i was with moses when he went through the red sea i was there and you know what when jesus was battling out in gethsemane guess where you were you were there i believe that i believe that i believe i was there he hadn't yet separated from himself the feminist spirit i was there i had to be so you know what's going to give you prevailing strength to overcome you've already overcame you already fought it out you already have fought this battle in the mind of christ already thousands of years ago now your light is coming and bringing into view the expressed manifestation of that overcoming that took place two thousand years ago you were there in the garden of the catheter and you fought and overcame so if anything should give you an encouragement realize you're riding this trail again you've already fought this battle you've already overcome because you were with him when he was overcoming now i was with david when he was rejected of his brethren i was with him you were too if you're a christian you have to be identified in his rejections i was with the hebrew children in the fiery furnace when the fire could not burn them because of the presence of the fourth man i was with daniel in the lion's den i was there i was identified there when the angel of the lord identified him in there i most surely was with him at calvary i must be identified with him at calvary and i must be there to a place that where not also i was identified with him at calvary i died with him at calvary every christian must die with him at calvary you don't die with him if you don't die with him at calvary you can't be none of his i was there and when he died i died with him and when and then i was was with him when he was raised up from the dead i come up on easter morning with him in that resurrection whatever he did i was there with him every believer is of the same and now i am seated with him in heavenly places in christ jesus and the powers of hell have been conquered through him and every christian believer is seated the same way because you have to be identified now i find myself in these last days and many of the believing christians christians have identified are identified in his ministry he's the same yesterday today and forever and i find myself in this i in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself the same way believing it walking with it notice that when he did he said the believer would do the same things the works that i do you also then you can be identified with him and when the reproach comes upon the word you can stand their approach like he did see identified with him so when he fought and overcame i overcame with him so now that i find myself identified in the same ministry here in this day i know i can overcome do you know you can overcome because you're already overcame you already did this you already have overcome this isn't a mystery this is something that he's brought into view no wonder there's a rock we can stand on in this final day can i bring another one mary you know mary had a silent battle a silent victory and a public victory the angel lord came to mary one day it says the angel came said fear not mary thou sound favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb where was this womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the most high and the lord god shall give him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and his kingdom there shall be no end then mary said unto the angel how shall this be seen i know no man boom immediately uh oh something in her mind no man has ever been born outside of being with another man a woman must be with a woman okay now here comes the answer what will she do mary here's your showdown it's in your mind the battles are aging and the angel answered and said the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the most high shall overshadow thee therefore also this holy thing that shall be borne in thee it shall be called the son of god and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord and be it unto me according to the word so immediately when that doubt and reasoning started to come in boom something came up faith started to rise up and say no i believe what you're saying is the truth i believe you chose me and i believe i'm the vessel i'm the womb that i'm going to accept your word i'm going to accept it into the womb of my mind i'm going to accept it and i'm going to bring it forth and that's exactly what happens with you and me exactly we may say how can it be that i'll be found spotless and without wrinkle how can it be he's predestinated you to not fall like he fell he's predestinated you to stand and he sent the word the light the manifestation needed to bring you to your full potential the devil is not pulling this trick over on us we value the word that we've been given in this hour it's the very mind of god so the bride's now time in her silence to bring forth victory or defeat revelations i'm sorry christ is a mystery of god it says and said satan oh you know she turned around and listened to him but the eve and the last day she's not going to do it because she's predestinated not to no sir god knows god's going to do it he knows he'll have it she'll be there without spot the church would be there without spot or wrinkle she's going to stand there in the splendor of him in his word made manifested now remember the church that christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit anti-word spirit would come in the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works and his attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time that he is cast into the lake of fire he fights it he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirit spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be as power powerless before her he will be as definitely thought of today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail against them do you find yourself saying that you find yourself bringing that into view when the goliath shows up at your scene can you go back and say you know the same god that delivered me from the paul of the bear and the jaws of a lion and this uncircumcised philistine he's going to deliver in every obstacle and every difficulty and everything that i find in my way because he predestinated me to stand he knew that i would overcome he knew that i would be here in satan's eden and this is as dark as it has to be because there's such a great light here to fight this foe there has to be this bad you know that don't complain that things are bad it's got to get this dark but the fact that the darkness is covering the earth how horrible it is for the unbeliever but brother man said but how wonderful it is for the believer because it's in the darkness that the light can shine forth so now this great light that came in this hour is calling forth for these other lights to arise and shine because this is the hour that we have been called to and we've been trained and we've been taught and we've been equipped we know how to fight this battle we don't have to say i don't know how to overcome yes you do you know how to overcome don't believe that kind of a lie you know what to do you know how to fight and you know the tactics of the enemy musicians will you come i want you to turn in a few scripture verses if this is okay i did this with the youth and i'd like to do it with you you are now designated youth okay ii timothy verse 1. remember we look at ourselves we see nothing but weakness and failure the only thing you can say that you're good at is you're a good failure but if we look at what god says about us we can say oh my greater see that's in me than he that's in this world i'm more than an overcomer if you know not to say it braggingly but the devil can overcome he can't overcome you he can only overcome you when you put away the word that's the only time he can overcome you ever and he'll always start in your mind that's where the battles fall and i know you know these things but i just felt to bring it to your attention second timothy verse 1 or chapter 1 verse 7 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but power love and of a sound mind you hear that i want you to read it we're going to read it together for god hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power love and of a sound mind okay you got it good now we're going to change it up i want where it says us you insert your name for god hath not given kyle the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind see see how good you're doing first john 4 verse 4. first john 4 verse 4. say amen when you're there ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now where it says you put your name in it as we read ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in kyle than he that is in the world okay i'm training soldiers how to fight i know it sounds simple but god's hiding in simplicity you see it's not the great mental it's very calm very settled you have to take the word and speak the word turn to isaiah 26 verse 3. and i i hope i'm not i'm not meaning to be condescending i'm not at all you have to understand these are the basics of our warfare isaiah 26 3. i'll read it while you're turning thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee now where it says him insert your name and let's read it thou wilt keep kyle in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because kyle trusted in thee wow f-a-i-t-h-n-j-e-s-u-s no match for the devil he may look like quite a foe it may look like you cannot overcome that but it's f a i t h n j e s u s the word all you have to do is let it come through the right channel speak the word and let the holy spirit guide that stone to take out your enemy you don't have to do it i want you to return in your bibles to psalms 91. psalms 91 verse 1. david said i keep the word always before me that i would not sin against thee you know he was the meditation of his heart his dwelling place isaiah 91 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide unto the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress and my god in him will i trust i love how david makes it personal david isn't just saying he is to other people he's saying he's my refuge my strength my fortress he had that revelation of the rock surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noise and some pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings thou shalt trust his truth shall be my shield and my buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night or the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilences that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand on thy right hand but it will not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high my habitation i don't think it was just because david was dwelling in a physical temple i believe his habitation was in his mind i believe he let the word of god have the preeminence in his mind i believe that was the place that he gave god the preeminences and therefore he could stand upon a rock and could take out every foe will you stand with me i pray that it was a blessing i enjoyed studying it i enjoyed going through it and it is encouraging me god's words and encouragement to us you know as we get a little bit it would say older and mature i guess in the lord you begin to realize you're not moved by the winds the earthquakes or the fires it's always the still small voice that calls you out of the cave and puts you recommissioned back into your post of duty as a soldier of christ that still small voice how he speaks and how that calls forth god's elect each and every time so my prayer was that the word was just a blessing to you and that you can say lord be it unto me according to thy word may your word be established in my mind may it be the confession of my my lips and it may be the action of my life the very purpose of my living you just bow your heads for a word of prayer heavenly father we so thank you for this day lord i'm so thankful for your word it means just so very much to me lord it's all it's my strength it's my shield it's my buckler it's my hiding place lord may we all each individually find you to be our hiding place not in the cares or the pleasures of this life no it's a delilah whispering trying to put you to sleep lord but may we find that we are entertained by the holy spirit you prophet said that the bride is entertained by the holy spirit the word that's our entertainment that's the place that we love to dwell we love to be lord that's the place of peace safety joy overflowing father if there's any here today lord that they had had some the devil i pray has been exposed that's my prayer the devil could be exposed in the hiding places that he hides in lord and little avenues and little channels that he might have had an influence into each and every one of our lives maybe we've been trying to cover up a scar or a weakness lord but we are covering it with the wrong thing lord let us cover it with the word of god and with prayer lord that's what we were told to do father you've done all that you needed to do you've provided everything we have need of for this journey through satan's eden lord may your bride and i know she will not be overcome but may she overcome the satan's eating she was predestinated to it lord we love you we commit ourselves afresh and anew to you take us lord and use us for your purpose and for your glory we love you in jesus name amen god bless you it's really an honor and privilege to speak to you this morning and brother chad if you don't mind coming brother if you've got a song oh they were beaten hopeless beating and so weary [Music] are waiting for this day of liberty just to see the glorious sunrise from the highest mountaintop in this dawn we'll see their shackles falling off [Music] rising of the a new day has begun rays of mercy made us free from sin today o the joy that fills my soul for the message is my all thank you jesus for this day of liberty brave is empty he's raised in water day because i live you shall live as well he said resurrected with christ jesus lift your hands toward the sky your reward is [Applause] [Music] for us that day our redeemer and our god soon he'll catch away his bride thank you jesus for this day of victory amen god bless you i tell you i was certainly edified by the word this morning very much encouraged amen just to take god at his word just to confess it and believe it amen and not be afraid i was thinking he's given those examples how many how many examples we could go through in the bible remember david wasn't afraid of the revelation that came through samuel it didn't scare him he was willing to be identified with what the prophet said he was and it gave him overcoming power and remember mary was not afraid of the revelation that came from the angel messenger she went directly before she felt one thing brother benham said before she felt any change in her body she went and confessed it to elizabeth amen and then as soon as she confessed that elizabeth began to prophesy being filled with the holy ghost she wasn't afraid of what the angel messenger said she was willing to confess it and it and it gave her power to overcome i say help us never to be afraid of what the prophet told us about what god has done for us and who we are in this day let's believe it let's confess it let's focus on it and let that revelation give us overcoming power amen god is certainly good i say it was really good to have brother emanuel back i think he's in the booth translating but he's back from oregon he and his wife it's good to have them back appreciate the message i appreciate the sacrifice of our brother may the lord bless him and also i appreciate that song special sister naomi that was a real blessing amen blessed me and encouraged me amen tell your god is good there's a lot of things amen i want to be more careful of i want to keep i want to keep myself preserved for this word so that this word can live through this body of flesh man god is still never taking away free moral agency you're still the vessel he wants to use to have victory in the he's still the power that we'll overcome but he's given us the choice of what we yield ourselves to and that choice will determine how easy or how hard this is going to go and i said i want to use the power of free moral agency that he's put in my hand and i want to choose to surrender myself to him and and keep myself separated from the world for his use so that he can do what he's promised to do in this age i'm encouraged to be more determined than ever to keep myself separated unto him amen let's bow our heads and pray thank you lord jesus for this day thank you for this word i appreciate the gift you placed in our brother and the sacrifice he made to yield himself to your hand so that you could use him to bring this word and this word will change our lives lord it is changing our lives it's encouraging us in a better way i pray god that you would come and take full possession of these vessels any area lord that we've been laxed and lazy and lord forgive us for that help us lord to gird up the loins of our mind and not let them run loose lord but to gird them up and keep ourselves focused stored on the purpose for which you've called us in this life and may we give you preeminence lord for that's the age we live in the age that you will have preeminence and a people while we thank you for your word help us to go yield to it that the word might live in us and might live through us and may you gain your victory in this day through your bride we love you father and we ask that you would bless us as we move from here may these lessons not fade away may what we've heard lord not move into the past but may it become part of our daily life that we might have more victory by your grace we love you father we ask your blessings over us as we part in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you god bless your brother by standing all within the presence of the lord whom the wisdom of the ages lies for whom the raging of the seeds my only source of life my hope is in the lord from is this tender mercy comes with every rising sun to meet the sinner in his brokenness to offer healing and forgiveness [Music]
