[16:40] always greet visitors but we're happy to
[16:42] have everybody
[16:43] amen let's look at Matthew chapter
[16:49] 28 Matthew 28 and verse 19
[16:58] Matthew 28:
[17:01] 19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations
[17:04] baptizing them in the name of the father
[17:06] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[17:08] teaching them to observe all things
[17:10] whatsoever I've commanded you and lo I
[17:12] Am With You Always even to the end of
[17:15] the world Amen God bless you as you have
[17:18] your
[17:20] seats for a subject this evening I'd
[17:23] like to take uh I am with you and in you
[17:27] and many of you know the message really
[17:29] well you know that brother brandham says
[17:30] this many times when he quotes a couple
[17:33] different scriptures but he'll he'll use
[17:34] the term that he'll say I am I am with
[17:37] you even in you to the end of the world
[17:40] and and brother bham is combining a
[17:42] couple different scriptures together
[17:43] when he does it and he repeats it that
[17:45] way multitudes of times amen because
[17:48] it's absolutely the true it's a true
[17:49] statement amen because he says here uh I
[17:53] Am With You Always even to the end of
[17:56] the world and so that's a promise that
[17:59] has God given to his disciples amen it's
[18:01] in a promise that we never want to
[18:03] forget uh if you can turn with me to
[18:06] Acts chapter
[18:09] 7 we're going to read here in uh out of
[18:13] Acts we're going to read a little bit
[18:14] about Moses going to Egypt but we're
[18:15] going to pick it up in Acts because when
[18:17] Stephen is is preaching right before
[18:20] he's stoned he goes through a history of
[18:22] the church and he condenses some
[18:24] scriptures down into a thought and it's
[18:26] very concise so I'm going to pull it
[18:28] here from from what Steven says in Acts
[18:32] 7:33 it says then said the Lord to him
[18:36] put off thy shoes from thy feet for the
[18:37] place where thou standest is Holy Ground
[18:40] I have seen I have seen the Affliction
[18:42] of my people which is in Egypt and I
[18:44] have heard their groanings and and am
[18:47] come down to deliver them and now come I
[18:50] will send thee unto Egypt amen so God
[18:54] says I have seen the Affliction of my
[18:58] people amen and I have heard their
[19:00] groanings and I have come down so this
[19:04] is the coming of the Lord he's coming to
[19:05] fulfill his promise word because he made
[19:07] a promise amen that his people Abraham's
[19:10] seed shall sojourn in a Strange Land for
[19:12] 400 years but he said I will bring them
[19:14] out with a mighty hand so God had
[19:16] promised to visit them and God had
[19:18] promised to deliver them and now God
[19:20] comes to the time where he comes to the
[19:22] Moses and he says I've seen their
[19:24] afflictions I've heard their groanings
[19:26] and I have come down to deliver them
[19:28] amen I've come down to keep my promise
[19:31] but when I come down he says now come I
[19:33] will send thee un Egypt so when God came
[19:37] to deliver what they saw brother B said
[19:40] what they saw was a man with a stick in
[19:43] his hand and a beard amen that's what
[19:45] they saw but it was God coming to
[19:46] fulfill his word it was God coming down
[19:49] as he promised to deliver his children
[19:51] with a mighty hand amen and so amen they
[19:55] had to recognize their message and their
[19:58] day yes let's go to Exodus chapter 3 and
[20:02] Pick up a little more of
[20:04] this in Exodus chapter
[20:13] 3 look at verse 11 it's amazing what
[20:17] always throws people off is the way God
[20:19] fulfills his
[20:20] word he never does it a way they assume
[20:23] when he says you know the children shall
[20:25] sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years
[20:28] but I will bring them out with a mighty
[20:30] hand you know for years they would
[20:32] recite that uh promise to one another
[20:35] and they would look forward to it and it
[20:36] was a source of encouragement a source
[20:38] of strength some anticipation but no
[20:40] doubt they had many fanciful ideas of
[20:43] how that was going to
[20:44] happen but the way God did it was not
[20:47] the way they expected it amen but it was
[20:49] God nonetheless and it was God working
[20:52] through a servant working in and through
[20:53] a servant and he was working through
[20:55] Moses and brother Ben said it was Christ
[20:57] in Moses CU Christ was the anointed word
[21:00] for the day and that anointed word was
[21:02] working through Moses God had a vessel
[21:06] and in Exodus
[21:07] 3:
[21:09] 11 he says and Moses said unto God who
[21:12] am I that I should go into pharaoh and
[21:14] that I should bring forth the children
[21:15] of Israel out of Egypt and he said
[21:18] certainly I will be with thee of course
[21:21] he'll be with thee CU he said I come and
[21:24] I'm going and I'm sending you so
[21:27] certainly he'll be with he said
[21:29] certainly I will be with thee and this
[21:30] shall be a token unto thee I have sent
[21:33] thee when thou has brought forth thy
[21:34] people out of Egypt ye shall serve God
[21:37] Upon This Mountain so God was sending
[21:40] them to Egypt to bring them back to to
[21:42] worship on the mountain and he said
[21:43] that's going to be the token but he said
[21:45] certainly I will be with thee that was a
[21:48] promise to Moses Moses was sin of God
[21:50] Amen he was there representing the power
[21:52] he was there representing the arm of God
[21:54] to deliver them and God was working
[21:56] through Moses amen but God said I will
[21:58] be with thee and then in Exodus
[22:04] 14 Exodus 14:1
[22:10] 15 this is when they're up against the
[22:12] Red Sea they begin to holler and
[22:16] complain in verse
[22:18] 15 he says and the Lord said unto Moses
[22:21] wherefore criest down unto
[22:25] me speak
[22:28] wherefore Christ unto me speak unto the
[22:30] children of Israel that they go forward
[22:32] but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out
[22:34] thy hand over the sea and divide it and
[22:36] the children of Israel shall go on dry
[22:38] ground through the midst of the sea so
[22:41] now we know the predicament that Moses
[22:43] is in Moses has went to Egypt he has
[22:46] done the the the signs that were that
[22:48] the God gave him to declare himself to
[22:50] Israel now he brought uh destruction
[22:53] upon Egypt through the plagues and he
[22:56] delivered God had delivered through
[22:57] Moses delivered the children of Israel
[22:59] with a mighty hand and they spoiled
[23:01] Egypt and they came out into the desert
[23:03] and they were dancing and they were
[23:04] happy and they they had spoiled their
[23:06] their their captors and now they come up
[23:08] to the first big trial up against the
[23:11] Red Sea hemmed in by the mountains with
[23:12] no Escape Route amen and the army of
[23:15] Egypt was barreling down upon them and
[23:16] they began to lose all hope am mean they
[23:19] begin to lose I mean everything that God
[23:21] had done had just went out of their mind
[23:24] all the plagues all the destruction I
[23:26] mean they're there crying and their
[23:29] children are robed in Silkk and golden
[23:31] chains around their neck because they
[23:32] had so much loot they couldn't carry it
[23:34] themselves they had to put it on their
[23:36] kids can you imagine them standing there
[23:39] Egypt is absolutely H wrecked amen they
[23:42] spoiled their neighbors and they're
[23:44] standing there and and in Rich apparel
[23:47] amen they're standing there with with
[23:49] all kinds of goods and their kids have
[23:51] gold chains around them and they're
[23:53] saying why did you bring us here to kill
[23:55] us we're all going to die amen
[23:59] oh man it sounds silly but it happens
[24:02] again in this day they're there with the
[24:05] blessings upon
[24:06] them forgetting what God had done they
[24:09] were looking with their eyes at the
[24:11] obstacle and there sound no no way
[24:13] around it amen and then Moses began to
[24:16] cry out and God says to Moses why criest
[24:18] thou unto me speak that the children of
[24:21] Israel move forward and and and it's
[24:23] amazing to me say why CRI out to me amen
[24:26] because God was looking at the solution
[24:28] the solution was Moses amen Moses you
[24:31] speak that they go forward you lift up
[24:34] the rod I sent you I've come down but
[24:37] I've sent you and I promise to be with
[24:39] you why Christ unto me speak that they
[24:41] go forward move the right you're the
[24:45] solution you're the one that I sent my
[24:48] power is working through you you're the
[24:50] one who's bringing the Deliverance now
[24:52] I'm not God was doing but he's doing it
[24:53] through
[24:55] Moses Moses was the solution
[24:59] amen when they got in the bind they
[25:02] forgot but God saved them let's turn to
[25:06] the Book of Judges
[25:17] now now let's look at Judges chapter uh
[25:21] six Judges chapter
[25:23] 6 and verse
[25:26] 11 come to the story of Gideon
[25:30] and in judges 611 it says and there came
[25:32] an angel of the Lord and sat under an
[25:34] oak which was in ofra that pertaineth in
[25:37] joash the
[25:39] abizer and his son Gideon threshed Wheat
[25:41] by the wine press to hide it from the
[25:43] midianites and the angel of the Lord
[25:45] appeared unto him and said unto him the
[25:47] Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[25:50] Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my
[25:52] Lord if the Lord be with us why then is
[25:55] all this befallen us and where be all
[25:57] his miracle which our father told us of
[25:59] saying did not the Lord bring us up from
[26:02] Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us
[26:04] and delivered us into the hands of the
[26:06] midianites this is amazing the angel
[26:08] comes to to to Gideon and he knows where
[26:11] to find Gideon hiding behind the wine
[26:13] press um threshing out a little wheat to
[26:15] hide it from the midianites and he says
[26:18] I love how he says this he says the
[26:22] angel of the Lord appeared unto him and
[26:23] said unto him the Lord is with
[26:26] thee the Lord is with the that was a
[26:29] revelation to Gideon Gideon didn't know
[26:32] the Lord was with him Gideon thought
[26:34] they were Forsaken and they were all
[26:36] alone and they had been cast out and God
[26:38] wasn't with them and there's no more
[26:39] miracles and and they were under bondage
[26:41] and they were coming to take our crops
[26:43] again and the midianites are strong
[26:45] those are all the things he saw but what
[26:47] the angel came to tell him was tell him
[26:49] something that God saw that Gideon
[26:50] couldn't see and he said the Lord is
[26:52] with
[26:53] thee and he says wow if if that's true
[26:57] the if God be with us and why why is all
[26:59] this befalling us and where are his
[27:01] miracles and where are this and I love
[27:03] it the the scripture now says and the
[27:05] Lord looked at him let's let's read on
[27:08] verse 14 and the Lord looked upon
[27:11] him and don't read
[27:13] further I didn't give you permission to
[27:17] refer it says and the Lord looked at him
[27:21] the Lord didn't answer his
[27:24] question at least he didn't answer it
[27:26] directly
[27:29] he didn't explain all that had been
[27:31] going on and why it had happened and the
[27:33] falling away and and the things that he
[27:35] was displaying he didn't explain all of
[27:37] that he had already told him the Lord is
[27:39] with thee and Gideon begin to question
[27:41] it and begin to and it just says I just
[27:43] love it and it says and the Lord uh
[27:45] verse 14 and the Lord looked upon
[27:48] him I wonder what kind of look he gave
[27:51] him because I mean the scripture is very
[27:55] specific that the Lord looked upon him I
[27:57] mean could have just went into saying
[27:59] what he was going to say next but it
[28:00] stopped to say the Lord looked upon him
[28:03] and it to me I believe that there was
[28:05] something in the look there was a pause
[28:07] there was something that that that is
[28:09] significant enough that the Bible
[28:11] records and the Lord looked upon
[28:13] him because he had said the Lord be with
[28:16] thee and he starts to say well well how
[28:18] is he with us if he's with us then then
[28:20] why is this and where are the Miracles
[28:22] and all of that and then the next thing
[28:24] it says is the Lord looked upon
[28:26] him very very
[28:30] interesting and the Lord looked upon him
[28:32] and
[28:33] said go in this thy might and thou shalt
[28:36] save Israel from the hand of the
[28:38] midianites have not I sent theej
[28:44] amen here what he says the Lord is with
[28:48] thee if God be with us then why this and
[28:51] why this and why everything I see and
[28:53] why all my circumstances and why is the
[28:55] mid nightes and why are the Miracles and
[28:57] why and the Lord just looked upon
[29:01] him the Lord just looked at him didn't
[29:04] answer he looked at him he says go in
[29:08] this thy
[29:09] might and thou shalt
[29:12] deliver
[29:13] you're you're the place of
[29:16] Deliverance you're the Miracles you're
[29:20] just like I he said the he just like he
[29:23] he said to Moses I will be with thee
[29:25] amen certainly I will be with thee I
[29:27] send you now he comes to Gideon and he
[29:30] looks at Gideon and Gideon's going to be
[29:32] the solution to Gideon's own
[29:34] questions it's going to take place in
[29:36] his own life it's going to happen
[29:38] through him it's going to happen to him
[29:40] and he's wondering well all this stuff
[29:42] and why is it this way and the Lord just
[29:44] looked at him and the Lord I can only
[29:45] imagine now I don't have a clue what God
[29:47] was thinking or why he looked at him the
[29:49] way he did but I wonder if he's looked
[29:51] at him and tried to get Gideon to
[29:52] realize it's you yeah where's all this
[29:56] and why all this and
[30:02] I already said I'm with
[30:04] you I'm with you what else do you need
[30:07] to
[30:09] know the Lord is with thee but why this
[30:12] by why this but he's not answering that
[30:15] he just looked at
[30:17] him man I wonder how many times in all
[30:20] of our crying and all of our complaining
[30:22] and all of our worrying if God doesn't
[30:23] just look at us say I already told you
[30:26] through a prophet I'm with you I promise
[30:28] to never leave you nor forsake you I
[30:31] said in the word I'll be with you always
[30:32] to the end of the world Amen this day
[30:35] it's in you you're the solution you're
[30:38] the answer to the
[30:41] question he says all he says is go in
[30:44] this thy might and thou shalt save
[30:47] Israel from the hand of the midianites
[30:49] have not I sent thee
[30:53] Hallelujah that's it that's it it's
[30:56] finished if God sent him it was over if
[30:59] God sent him he was going to win if God
[31:01] sent him they were going to be delivered
[31:02] if God sent him now was the time if God
[31:04] sent him all questions are
[31:07] answered
[31:10] amen we ask a lot of questions yes and I
[31:13] wonder if he just looks at us
[31:16] sometimes
[31:18] amen let's go to John chapter 20
[31:30] can you imagine after the prophet told
[31:32] us who the bride is and what Christ has
[31:34] done in this generation and we in our
[31:37] moment of Crisis begin to cry out God
[31:39] where are you where are you where are
[31:41] you where are you and the prophets
[31:43] already told us where he
[31:44] is we say God why won't you come why
[31:48] won't you come on the scene why won't
[31:49] you come and Deliver Me and the prophets
[31:51] already told us where he
[31:56] is wonder if he could just look at
[32:00] us John 20:
[32:07] 211 then said Jesus to them again peace
[32:09] be unto you as my father has sent me
[32:12] even so send I you and when he had said
[32:15] this he breathed on them and saith unto
[32:17] them receive ye the Holy Ghost brother
[32:21] Brenham said though same way the father
[32:22] sent him as the way he sent them he went
[32:24] in
[32:25] them amen so as the father has sent him
[32:28] so send I you and it was going to be the
[32:30] coming of the Holy Ghost he was going to
[32:32] actually come in them and Le through
[32:33] them and he promised I will be with you
[32:36] always let's go back to verse 14 or
[32:39] chapter 14 I'm sorry go back to Chapter
[32:41] 14 verse
[32:46] 18 Jesus says to them in chapter John
[32:49] chap 14: 18 says I will not leave you
[32:53] comfortless I will come to you amen yet
[32:57] a little while in the World teaches me
[32:58] no more but ye see me because I live you
[33:01] shall live also at that day you shall
[33:03] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[33:06] and I in
[33:09] you I am with you and in
[33:14] you now it doesn't make sense anymore to
[33:16] pray God where are
[33:19] you God where are you God where are you
[33:23] I don't see you in the trial I don't
[33:25] understand where you're at I don't know
[33:26] why the situation like this I don't know
[33:28] why I'm in trouble I don't know this I
[33:29] don't know that where are
[33:31] you I wish I wish sometimes we could
[33:34] just see his eyes look at
[33:36] us and say go in this thy
[33:39] might amen I'm using you to finish my
[33:43] work in this last time I'm using you to
[33:45] finish the work that I left for this
[33:47] hour go in this thy might and go do the
[33:49] work I've called you to do have not I
[33:51] sent
[33:52] thee amen I don't want it to be just for
[33:54] Gideon and just for Moses but I want it
[33:56] to be for me now God has sent me when he
[33:59] told his disciples go into all nations
[34:01] and preach the gospel he sent them out
[34:03] and said lo I am with thee
[34:05] always I want to believe that he's with
[34:07] me now and according to the word in
[34:12] Meen brother Brenham has a a interesting
[34:16] quote I'd just like to bring to your
[34:17] attention from calling Jesus on the
[34:20] scene he he says now you say how could
[34:23] he be God and be man see there is a
[34:26] mystery see in body he was man in spirit
[34:31] he was God someone asked me said then
[34:34] how did who did he pray to In The Garden
[34:37] of
[34:37] Gethsemane I love this quote this is one
[34:40] of those head Spinners you know but it's
[34:42] the truth and nonetheless who did he
[34:45] pray to In The Garden of Gethsemane I
[34:47] said I'll answer you that when you
[34:48] answer this do you believe you have the
[34:50] Holy Ghost said yes said then who do you
[34:54] pray to where is he at When you pray to
[34:57] him amen when you claim you have him and
[35:00] yet you're praying to him see people
[35:02] they they just get some little idea and
[35:04] run wildly you see that's the way it
[35:07] goes amen I love the way brother B
[35:10] answered the question amen who who was
[35:12] Jesus praying to in the garden of gethy
[35:14] and the question is do you have the Holy
[35:15] Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost where
[35:17] is
[35:18] Christ he's in me he said he would be in
[35:21] me he promised to be in me he said I
[35:23] will be with you I will be he said I
[35:24] will be in you amen and now we believe
[35:27] he's in US by the baptism of the Holy
[35:29] Ghost and who do we pray to we're
[35:31] praying to Christ where is he how far
[35:33] away how long does it take from my
[35:36] message to travel from my lips to his
[35:38] ears how far does he have to travel to
[35:40] come on the scene to deliver
[35:43] me amen we've been brought up higher in
[35:46] this age so we don't keep thinking those
[35:48] carnal thoughts and keep putting God far
[35:50] away amen and we can feel God's presence
[35:53] so close and know that he's so near to
[35:55] us and we walk away elated sometimes
[35:57] with a church service cuz it was so
[35:58] tangible his presence was so real amen
[36:01] but then we get into a trial and we
[36:03] don't have that same feeling and he
[36:04] feels so far away and we're praying to a
[36:07] God and our prayer the the tone of our
[36:09] voice and the way we're praying we're
[36:11] praying to somebody that is far far
[36:16] away but oh God give us the Revelation
[36:19] amen that breaks that off of us and let
[36:21] us realize that if he's if he was with
[36:23] us he's always with us he's not coming
[36:25] and going he's not leaving he's not
[36:27] abandoning ship in the time of trouble
[36:29] but he's
[36:30] here he's in you he promised to be in
[36:34] you Amen brother bham said in the
[36:37] message the healing of gyrus his
[36:39] daughter this is preached back in 1955
[36:42] he says just just previous of this
[36:44] chapter we find one place where the Son
[36:46] of God spent so much time in prayer I
[36:49] want you to hear how he talks about
[36:51] prayer and if Jesus had to spend much
[36:55] time in prayer to stay in fellowship
[36:58] with the spirit that was in
[37:01] him how much more do you and I have to
[37:04] spend in
[37:06] prayer so Jesus was spending time in
[37:09] prayer to do what to pray to a father
[37:12] that was far off in
[37:15] heaven to stay in fellowship with the
[37:18] spirit that was in him so now what is
[37:21] our prayer life doing staying in
[37:23] fellowship with the spirit of God that's
[37:25] in us staying connected to the one
[37:28] that's in
[37:29] US amen almighty
[37:32] god let's go to the Book of
[37:36] Jeremiah listen I am going to read all
[37:38] of these things and we're going to say
[37:40] Amen to all of it and the next time we
[37:42] get into a trial and everything goes
[37:44] wrong we are going to have to ask God to
[37:46] bring this back to our memory because we
[37:49] slip into the carnal so fast because our
[37:51] human side is so carnal it's always see
[37:54] taste feel smell and hear but we got to
[37:55] come back to the revelation of this
[37:57] power and understand where he abides
[38:00] now amen he poured himself where into
[38:04] the church amen where he's at he's in
[38:06] you amen he's in me amen where am I
[38:08] praying how far am i mailing it how many
[38:11] how much postage do I have to put on the
[38:13] prayer so that it gets to the
[38:20] destination I just need to pray to stay
[38:22] in fellowship with the spirit that's in
[38:26] me jeremi 8 and
[38:34] 19 Jeremiah
[38:38] 8:19 says behold the voice of the Cry of
[38:41] the daughter of my people because of
[38:42] them that dwell in a far country they
[38:45] were crying because the enemy was coming
[38:47] they were going to be taken
[38:49] captive it says is not the Lord in
[38:53] Zion who's he talking to he's talking to
[38:57] Judah
[38:58] he's talking to those that dwell in
[38:59] Jerusalem those that dwell in Zion he
[39:02] said my people are crying because of a
[39:03] people from a far country but is not the
[39:06] Lord in
[39:07] Zion is not her King in
[39:13] her amen is not her King in her this is
[39:17] this is what through the Prophet
[39:18] Jeremiah this is what God is trying to
[39:20] bring their attention to you're upset
[39:22] you're crying because of there people
[39:24] from AAR countries coming but isn't the
[39:26] King in Zion amen isn't the Lord and
[39:28] Zion isn't her King in
[39:32] her he says why have they provoked me to
[39:34] anger with their graven images and with
[39:36] their strange vanities the Harvest is
[39:39] passed the summer has ended and we are
[39:40] not saved for the her of the daughter of
[39:43] my people I am hurt I am black that just
[39:45] means he's mourning dark with mourning
[39:48] astonishment had taken hold on me is
[39:51] there no bomb in Gilead is there no
[39:53] physician there why then is not the
[39:55] health of my daughter of my people
[39:57] recover
[39:58] covered he's saying you're not forsaken
[40:02] you're not abandoned it's not the Lord
[40:05] in Zion you're in Zion is not the Lord
[40:07] in Zion amen what you've done is you
[40:09] provoked me to anger because you missed
[40:11] who was in your presence and you went
[40:13] running around and trying find help
[40:15] somewhere else going to graven images
[40:18] and going to idols and going to the high
[40:20] places what were they trying to do they
[40:21] were desperately trying to get help from
[40:23] somewhere and they weren't recognizing
[40:25] that the King was still in Zion
[40:28] the King was in
[40:31] her and she was missing it running
[40:34] around scared trying to go to other gods
[40:37] for help and he says is there no bomb in
[40:40] Gilead is there not a physician there
[40:42] why then is my daughter not
[40:46] healed because they didn't recognize
[40:48] what was
[40:50] there that's
[40:53] why brother Benham is preaching in
[40:55] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[40:58] and he says this he says we are his
[41:01] victory the church is his victory we
[41:04] came forth in the last days with this
[41:06] glorious gospel showing his victory he
[41:08] died for this purpose and we are proof
[41:11] of his victory when we see him coming
[41:13] down and living among the church that's
[41:15] his
[41:16] victory amen where is the Lord he's in
[41:18] Zion where is the king he's in
[41:21] her man we don't need to run all over
[41:23] the place trying to find help the help
[41:25] is here amen
[41:28] the helper is
[41:29] here he says this shows that that he
[41:33] couldn't keep they couldn't keep him in
[41:34] the grave neither can they keep us
[41:36] that's right and we are already
[41:38] potentially arised because we raised
[41:40] from dead unbelief in his word from
[41:43] denominational Creeds to an eternal word
[41:45] of the Eternal God which is him hisself
[41:48] working through US manifesting himself
[41:50] that he is the same yesterday today and
[41:52] forever and then the word moves on down
[41:54] into the body from the head what is it
[41:56] the same word word nothing can be added
[41:58] or taken from it so the same word moves
[42:00] from the head as the day comes close
[42:02] down into the body down into the body
[42:05] vindicating that they are one they are
[42:06] husband and wife they're flesh of his
[42:09] flesh word of his word life of his life
[42:11] Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you
[42:13] know Bears the same record same fruit
[42:16] same word see manifest Christ same life
[42:18] same God Same Spirit same word same book
[42:22] amen amen same signs things that I do
[42:24] show you also oh Hallelujah notice the
[42:26] vind ated word in his body is his
[42:30] victory and the reason of his
[42:32] death what is that this message came
[42:35] Amen to be what the Vindicated word in
[42:37] his body a many membered body in his
[42:39] bride that's the Victory and that's the
[42:42] reason of his
[42:43] death so that what so that he can be
[42:46] made manifest in you where is he in you
[42:49] where is he living in you where is he
[42:51] working in you where is the Lord in Zion
[42:55] where is the king in
[43:01] her I don't want to be like Jerusalem of
[43:03] old and running everywhere trying to
[43:06] find help the help's
[43:08] here the help's
[43:11] here amen they were looking for a hero
[43:14] and even at one place they were
[43:16] entertaining having Egypt coming to help
[43:18] them and pay them a sum to come and help
[43:20] oh how the Lord was so angry with
[43:23] that because they were running
[43:24] everywhere to try to find help amen find
[43:27] so many times amen people begin when
[43:30] they get in trouble we find ourselves
[43:31] not just people me too like all people
[43:33] all of us we try to run to and fro
[43:37] trying to find help we go from a
[43:38] minister to a minister to a meeting to a
[43:40] meeting to a church to a church what are
[43:42] we trying to find we're trying to find
[43:44] somebody that can help us but we're
[43:45] failing to recognize he who's here he
[43:48] that is in you is greater than he that
[43:50] is in the world Amen and we're we're
[43:52] looking for a hero for another great one
[43:55] amen God wants to be the Great
[43:58] one amen we get scared and we get
[44:01] nervous we get fearful and we got to
[44:03] find somebody with the
[44:10] answer why is this happening why is this
[44:13] befalling us he looked at
[44:18] him go in this thy might and thou shalt
[44:21] deliver Thou shalt save Israel from the
[44:23] hand of the minites have not I sent thee
[44:29] God wants to overcome through you and I
[44:31] he wants to be the
[44:34] Overcomer he wants us to rely upon him
[44:38] and he is the word yes sir he wants to
[44:41] live in US dwell in us and he wants to
[44:43] conquer through us and overcome through
[44:49] us let's go to Matthew 21
[45:10] it's amazing Israel wanted a
[45:12] hero but God said he came
[45:16] down amen Moses agreed too they needed a
[45:19] hero he just didn't believe he was the
[45:20] one who could be the
[45:22] hero in the days of the minite uh uh
[45:26] enslavement
[45:28] they needed a hero even Gideon believed
[45:30] they needed a hero he just never
[45:32] believed that God would use him to be
[45:33] the
[45:35] hero amen sometimes we believe we need a
[45:38] hero but we failed to believe that God
[45:40] wants to overcome through us as simple
[45:43] as it is the Overcomer is here he's in
[45:49] you it doesn't mean that God's not going
[45:51] to use somebody else he'll use he'll use
[45:54] all of us to help one another
[45:57] but if we see somebody else as having
[46:00] God and I have to go to them to get God
[46:02] I miss the god that's in Me God can
[46:05] speak through that voice absolutely God
[46:07] can help me through that hand that's God
[46:09] too that's this Dwelling Place also and
[46:11] I recognize that but if I look that I
[46:13] need the I need somebody else because
[46:15] God's in that other person then I fail
[46:17] to recognize God's also in
[46:19] me so I keep looking for a man with God
[46:24] a man that's in touch with God a man
[46:25] that's close to God a man that can touch
[46:29] God how about being the man or woman
[46:32] that's in touch with God where God
[46:34] dwells in
[46:36] you
[46:39] amen amen Matthew 21 and
[46:45] 20 and when the disciples saw it they
[46:47] marveled saying how soon is the Fig Tree
[46:49] withered away Jesus answered and said
[46:52] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[46:53] if you have faith and doubt not you
[46:56] shall not only do this which is done to
[46:58] the Fig Tree but also if you shall say
[46:59] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[47:02] be thou cast into the sea it shall be

[47:32] perfect faith if ye believe then the
[47:35] mountain can be plucked up and cast into
[47:36] the sea this is what Jesus is trying to
[47:38] get them to understand they Marvel at
[47:40] what Jesus just did amen he just spoke
[47:43] to this tree and then that they come by
[47:45] the next day or whenever it was and the
[47:46] trees already withered up and they
[47:48] marveled at how soon it was withered up
[47:50] and Jesus said don't don't get don't get
[47:52] your eyes off on this amen realize now
[47:55] that if you if you believe and you don't
[47:56] doubt
[47:57] ye you not just me Jesus is standing
[48:01] here in flesh not just me but you can
[48:02] say to this mountain

[48:10] pick it back up where I was I say unto
[48:13] you if you have faith and doubt not ye
[48:15] you shall not only do this which is done
[48:16] to the Fig Tree but also if ye shall say
[48:19] unto the mountain be thou removed and be
[48:21] thou cast into the sea it shall be done
[48:23] and all things whatsoever you shall ask
[48:25] in prayer believing ye shall
[48:29] receive ye shall ask in prayer believing
[48:32] ye shall
[48:34] receive praise be to
[48:37] God man let's turn to Luke 17
[48:53] now Luke 17 and verse 20
[49:00] and when he was demanded of the
[49:02] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[49:03] come he answered them and said the
[49:05] kingdom of God cometh not with
[49:07] observation neither neither shall they
[49:09] say loow here or low there for behold
[49:12] the kingdom of God is within
[49:14] you amen how many's looking for the
[49:17] kingdom of
[49:19] God it's
[49:21] hiding it's hiding where's it hiding the
[49:24] kingdom of God is within you
[49:27] Amen in the future home brother bam said
[49:29] God already took us up uh God already
[49:32] took up his his Abode potentially
[49:34] brother V's preaching about future home
[49:36] where the bride and the bridegroom will
[49:37] dwell after the Millennium he's
[49:39] preaching future home and he says but
[49:41] God already took up his abod potentially
[49:44] the kingdom of God is on earth now amen
[49:47] in the hearts of his Saints we're always
[49:50] looking to Future looking to Future
[49:52] looking to future but but God
[49:54] potentially is already taken up his a
[49:56] boat on the Earth and he's taken up his
[49:57] bone his kingdom is in
[49:59] you amen his kingdom is on earth now in
[50:03] the hearts of his Saints it's his
[50:05] attributes that he began in the
[50:06] beginning now his attributes is redeemed
[50:10] so God the kingdom of God is on Earth
[50:13] how many believes that where in his
[50:17] bride and Christ is the mystery of God
[50:19] revealed he says then our headship is a
[50:21] kingdom the kingdom of God is within you
[50:24] said the Bible said the Bible Jesus the
[50:27] kingdom we are not a denomination we
[50:29] belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is
[50:31] the word of God made spirit and life in
[50:33] our own life so what is the kingdom of
[50:36] kingdom it is the word of God made
[50:38] spirit and life in our life it's the
[50:40] word living in us that's the kingdom of
[50:43] God bringing to pass every promise in
[50:46] this day as it did in that day when the
[50:48] word of God was one and the word of God
[50:50] is one in his church today making it the
[50:53] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[50:55] bring the message in the last last days
[50:57] and be taken up from the dead and the
[50:58] resurrection to go back and restore
[51:00] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[51:02] In the Garden of Eden the three-fold
[51:04] mystery of God his
[51:06] body amen so the kingdom of the kingdom
[51:09] is the word of God made spirit and life
[51:12] in our
[51:13] life
[51:17] amen let's go to First John
[51:21] 4:4 first John 4:4
[51:36] praise God I think I could wake up every
[51:39] morning and remind myself of these
[51:41] things I think I should wake up every
[51:43] morning and remind myself of these
[51:46] things 1 John
[51:48] 4:4 year of God little children and I've
[51:51] overcome them because greater is he that
[51:53] is in you than he that is in the world
[51:57] right amen no matter what you face
[52:00] greater is he that is in
[52:02] you and he that is in the world where is
[52:06] the answer it's in you have not I sent
[52:11] thee brother bam preached a message
[52:14] titled he that is in you he preached it
[52:16] in 1963 and he says this in this message
[52:19] if we only could receive this truth now
[52:22] just a moment if we only could realize
[52:24] that this scripture mean he that is in
[52:26] in you is greater than he that's in the
[52:28] world we can't understand that yet we
[52:30] say we believe it and we know it's true
[52:32] but we really don't understand it I'm
[52:35] glad he said that but I believe God's
[52:38] wanting us to understand it better I
[52:39] believe we're coming into a greater
[52:41] understanding because that's what he
[52:42] wants to do in this day yes sir but he
[52:45] says I love it he says we can't
[52:47] understand that yet we say we believe it
[52:48] and we do believe it and we know it's
[52:51] true but we really don't understand it
[52:54] Greater is he that's in you than he
[52:55] that's in the world
[52:57] what is in you that's greater it's
[52:59] Christ the Anointed God that was in
[53:01] Christ is in you greater is he that's in
[53:03] you than he that's in the world then if
[53:05] he's in you it's not you anymore living
[53:09] it's him living in you it's not your
[53:11] thinking what you would think about this
[53:13] it's what he said about this then if he
[53:15] is in you he absolutely would not deny
[53:18] what he said he couldn't do it but he
[53:21] would keep what he said and he's trying
[53:23] to find that person that he can
[53:25] vindicate himself through
[53:27] now listen to what he says next this is
[53:29] a really interesting statement and I'm
[53:31] glad brother B said it this way he said
[53:33] now that doesn't mean that he has to do
[53:35] it to everybody and the time that Moses
[53:37] led the children of Israel there was one
[53:40] that was Moses the rest of them just
[53:41] followed the message see some of them
[53:43] tried to raise up to impersonate it and
[53:45] God said separate yourself and just
[53:47] swallowed them up see now but he that's
[53:50] in you is greater than he that's in the
[53:52] world God in you like he was in Jesus
[53:54] Christ because what all God was he
[53:57] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[54:00] poured into the church see that's God in
[54:02] you he that's in you now he says this
[54:05] about he not all has to do it not he
[54:09] says now that does not mean uh he has to
[54:11] do it to everybody but in the time of
[54:14] Moses what brother Bram is showing is we
[54:15] don't have to repeat brother bram's
[54:18] Ministry to believe this is trueth we
[54:20] don't have to repeat that like brother
[54:21] ringan was saying God's not repeating
[54:23] we're not going back and trying to copy
[54:25] amen we're moving on into the bride
[54:27] dispensation of Jesus Christ is
[54:29] something he wants to do today we don't
[54:31] have to go back and repeat that God
[54:32] already did that to show where he was to
[54:34] vindicate the message coming to prove
[54:36] that this is I this is me amen so that
[54:39] we would receive it the rest of them
[54:40] just followed the message but that
[54:42] doesn't mean he's not working in you
[54:44] amen just because he did something
[54:45] special through the prophet to bring a
[54:47] Vindication he wants to be seen in a
[54:49] many membered body and he wants to do
[54:52] all of his works on Earth today through
[54:54] this body amen amen amen we don't need
[54:58] another another Prophet to rise up like
[55:00] brother bam God's already accomplished
[55:02] that amen the seventh angel is already
[55:04] come that work is finished now what he's
[55:07] wanting to do he's wanting to do in a
[55:08] many membered bride not in one man
[55:12] anymore and where is he going to do it
[55:14] he that's in
[55:15] you is greater than he that's in the
[55:18] world
[55:22] Amen we keep like I said before we keep
[55:25] looking around for a hearing hero but
[55:27] the hero is
[55:30] inside we keep looking around for
[55:32] somebody to rescue us but The Rescuer is
[55:35] inside yes
[55:38] amen you
[55:40] know this is this is where it comes to
[55:43] many times we don't know where to turn
[55:44] we don't know what to do we don't know
[55:46] what the solution is we don't know why
[55:48] we're in the fixes we're in sometimes we
[55:50] don't have all the answers and we just
[55:52] would love for somebody to come how many
[55:55] of you have ever wished brother was
[55:56] still
[55:57] alive you're honest praise God I've
[56:01] wished it many many many times but God
[56:03] saw fit to bring us to a greater
[56:04] maturity amen God saw fit to that he was
[56:08] going to do a work and that work was
[56:10] going to be in you in
[56:13] me we have to believe that and yield to
[56:16] that amen and and even though God used
[56:19] gifts in the body and God uses gifted
[56:21] men and women and God can speak through
[56:23] a brother or a sister and that that's
[56:25] still that's still the voice of God God
[56:27] can still do those things but you still
[56:29] have to have the witness inside of you
[56:31] that it's
[56:32] true somebody can get up behind this
[56:35] pulpit and they can lay out exactly the
[56:37] answer to the question that you had amen
[56:39] scripture by scripture by scripture it
[56:42] can be the voice of God absolutely
[56:44] speaking to that situation but if you
[56:46] don't have the resonator on the inside
[56:48] that say that's the truth you're just
[56:49] going to going to go over your head
[56:51] you're going to come into the service
[56:52] and leave the service and say oh I wish
[56:54] God would come and speak to me
[56:58] amen and it'll happen it'll happen time
[57:01] and time again a brother will say
[57:02] something in a conversation something
[57:04] will come up something will happen amen
[57:06] because it's it's he that's in you it's
[57:08] not that God's not using gifts God will
[57:10] use gifts it's not that God won't use
[57:12] the preaching of the word he'll use the
[57:13] preaching of the word he can still use
[57:15] dreams he can still use a word of
[57:16] knowledge he can use all of that but
[57:18] there's got to be something inside of
[57:20] you that clicks with that and say that's
[57:21] for me and that's the truth it's he
[57:24] that's in you
[57:26] right he's the hero he's the deliverer
[57:30] he's the
[57:32] Overcomer we are his victory he's having
[57:36] a victory inside of
[57:38] us that's where it's
[57:41] happening in the message go wake Jesus
[57:45] we we many of us know the story of
[57:47] gowake Jesus brother brandom preaches
[57:49] many times about Jesus getting into the
[57:51] boat after the campaign and he was tired
[57:53] and he goes to the back of the ship and
[57:55] he falls asleep sleep and they they they
[57:57] go out into the Sea of Galilee and they
[57:59] get caught up in a terrible
[58:01] storm and and they think they're going
[58:03] to die and and brother B preaches this
[58:06] in many places gowake Jesus calling
[58:08] Jesus on the scene and all kinds of
[58:10] places but here in go Jesus said then it
[58:13] must have said John the young fellow
[58:15] might have said think of it brethren we
[58:18] have him with us now oh what a thought
[58:21] he's now in the ship with
[58:24] us man they had just come from a
[58:26] campaign and they seen him do some of
[58:28] the greatest Miracles that's ever been
[58:29] done on the face of the Earth and they
[58:31] climb into this ship and and they they
[58:33] look back and they see him asleep back
[58:35] there and I love the way brother Brenham
[58:37] dramatizes this and they said think of
[58:39] it brethren we have him with us
[58:43] now oh would have thought he's now in
[58:45] the ship with
[58:47] us if we tonight my precious brother and
[58:49] sister could only settle down for a few
[58:51] moments to realize this Messiah that
[58:54] we've been talking about and God said
[58:56] would come and was here on Earth died
[58:58] rose again ascended into heaven and come
[59:00] back uh after 10 days and appeared to
[59:03] them at Pentecost and commission his
[59:04] church that same Jesus is with us today
[59:07] as we're sailing life solom
[59:10] man we talk about him we think about him
[59:13] we read about him what he did what he
[59:15] was how he lived what kind of works he
[59:18] did and then forget about it do you
[59:21] realize that he is with us not only with
[59:23] us but in us oh how I think that what a
[59:27] feeling of security it must have been to
[59:30] think about the very Creator himself
[59:32] sailing through Troubled Waters with
[59:36] them that's what John was thinking when
[59:38] to look back think
[59:40] Brethren he the one who opened the
[59:42] blinded eyes the one who fed 5,000 the
[59:45] one seemingly nobody can resist his
[59:47] wisdom nobody can stand against him no
[59:50] circumstances he's with
[59:52] us what a comfort that was What a
[59:55] Feeling of security it must have been to
[59:58] think that the very Creator himself
[1:00:00] sailing through Troubled Waters with
[1:00:02] them that's the way we feel sometimes
[1:00:04] when we're in the service and the word
[1:00:05] is breaking so powerful amen you feel
[1:00:08] like you could just scream and you could
[1:00:10] just take a Rapture right
[1:00:11] then or when God delivers or God heals
[1:00:14] or God answers a situation so perfect
[1:00:16] you know it was none other than the hand
[1:00:18] of God that just came down and boom boom
[1:00:20] boom the situation you were in is now
[1:00:23] solved you say oh you look over to your
[1:00:25] wife you look to your husband say oh
[1:00:27] isn't it so comforting to know that he's
[1:00:29] with us he's in the ship with
[1:00:32] us but listen what brother B says as he
[1:00:35] goes on in the
[1:00:36] message said then they found like we
[1:00:38] have today that trouble sets in the ship
[1:00:42] began to rock the winds blowed the sails
[1:00:44] away and the water filled up the boat
[1:00:46] what all hopes was gone all hopes of
[1:00:50] survival yes all of the sudden something
[1:00:52] happened trouble arose and down went the
[1:00:55] sails and Away the wind puffed it away
[1:00:57] and the ores begin to fail and crack and
[1:01:00] Creek as these bronny backed fishermen
[1:01:02] laid to them knowing how to face those
[1:01:04] waves and all of the sudden the boat
[1:01:06] filled up with water but isn't it
[1:01:08] strange that men who just a few hours
[1:01:10] ago amen seen him do such things had
[1:01:13] forgot all about
[1:01:15] it the God who raised the Dead The God
[1:01:17] Who healed the sick the God who feels
[1:01:19] fills with the Holy Ghost that we've
[1:01:21] seen done is now the same today he's
[1:01:25] right here here in the boat he is here
[1:01:27] with us Lo I'm with you always whether
[1:01:30] in troubles or when she's sailing smooth
[1:01:33] I'm still in the
[1:01:36] boat they had forgot about
[1:01:39] it and they thought all survival was
[1:01:41] gone they thought they had seen him do
[1:01:44] so many things but now they had
[1:01:46] forgotten he was in the boat all
[1:01:48] forgotten in the time of trouble just
[1:01:51] like it is now
[1:01:56] I have lived through this myself not the
[1:01:59] Sea of Galilee not a leral
[1:02:01] boat but I've been in the place where
[1:02:03] God so supernaturally delivered me so so
[1:02:07] powerfully showed himself to me did
[1:02:09] things that that no man could have done
[1:02:11] and and I had such a testimony of what
[1:02:13] God and it was so comforting to know
[1:02:14] God's with me and then the Troubles of
[1:02:17] Life creep in and then things unexpected
[1:02:19] happen and then things that go beyond
[1:02:21] our control and beyond our capabilities
[1:02:23] brother mam talks about these men were
[1:02:25] fishermen they were born on the sea
[1:02:26] their living in occupation with
[1:02:28] fishermen for Generations they were
[1:02:30] masters of mastering the sea but it got
[1:02:32] Beyond them yeah beyond their control
[1:02:35] beyond their ability and all their
[1:02:36] efforts failed and all their abilities
[1:02:38] failed and when everything failed they
[1:02:40] despaired of even their lives and they
[1:02:42] forgot that the one who fed 5,000 was
[1:02:45] right there he was right there and
[1:02:47] because he was inactive and not speaking
[1:02:49] and not animated they didn't they forgot
[1:02:52] all about who was in the ship
[1:02:57] yes amen I'm not angry at the disciples
[1:03:00] I'm angry at me because I forgot who was
[1:03:03] in the ship I forgot who promised that
[1:03:06] I'll be with you always to the end of
[1:03:08] the world that I'll be in you I in you
[1:03:10] and you in me amen that I'll not leave
[1:03:12] you comfortless but I will come to you I
[1:03:15] will indwell
[1:03:17] you and in the time of trouble I started
[1:03:20] talking like he wasn't in the
[1:03:23] ship I started acting like I was all
[1:03:27] alone I started speaking like there was
[1:03:30] no hope and all was lost yes turn to ma
[1:03:35] Mark chapter 4 with
[1:03:40] me turn to Mark chapter 4 verse 38
[1:04:01] it says Mark 4:38 and he was in the
[1:04:03] hinder part of the ship asleep on a
[1:04:06] pillow and they awoke him and say un him
[1:04:09] Master carest thou not that we
[1:04:13] perish look how their attitude had
[1:04:16] shifted they started out the boat with
[1:04:19] the blue skies and sunny day and look
[1:04:24] he's right here with us
[1:04:26] think about what he just saw what he
[1:04:28] just did and doesn't it feel good to
[1:04:30] walk with the Lord doesn't it feel good
[1:04:31] to be his disciples does
[1:04:33] it and in just a few moments time the
[1:04:36] circumstances changed and they said
[1:04:39] Master carest thou not that we
[1:04:43] perish like he didn't
[1:04:46] care and he arose and rebuked the wind
[1:04:48] and said unto the sea peace be still and
[1:04:52] the wind ceased and there was a great
[1:04:53] calm and he said unto them why are you
[1:04:56] so fearful how is it that you have no
[1:05:02] faith he was there all
[1:05:04] along brother B said he was just waiting
[1:05:07] to be called on the
[1:05:08] scene he was just waiting for somebody
[1:05:11] to recognized that he was there and that
[1:05:13] he had the same power he always had and
[1:05:14] he's the same deliver he always was he
[1:05:16] was just waiting to be called on the
[1:05:18] scene instead of calling them on the
[1:05:20] scene they were they were they were
[1:05:22] hoisting the sail and and they were
[1:05:24] bailing water and they were speaking
[1:05:26] ores but then when it got beyond all
[1:05:28] their power then they said now now they
[1:05:30] didn't say oh we need God now they said
[1:05:32] don't you even
[1:05:35] care but oh he cared he cared he was
[1:05:40] there waiting to be called on the
[1:05:42] scene
[1:05:44] friends he's with
[1:05:47] us he's in
[1:05:49] us he's with us always don't let there
[1:05:52] be a Bible verse Oh God help it not be a
[1:05:56] Bible verse let it be a reality to me
[1:05:59] that he's he's with me always even to
[1:06:01] the end of the
[1:06:03] world he says in the message go Jesus
[1:06:06] again I'm a little further down he says
[1:06:08] the father dwelleth in me he was the
[1:06:10] Messiah by that with that anointing made
[1:06:12] him fully Messiah and we with the same
[1:06:15] Spirit was upon him not in portion but
[1:06:17] the same quality with a portion upon us

[1:06:23] little sons of God adopted sons of God
[1:06:25] God and His holy spirit has sealed us

[1:06:45] said under the but what they should have

[1:07:00] in remember despairing for Life gave up
[1:07:03] all hope of surviving amen the ores were

[1:07:13] that we perish but brother brandham said
[1:07:15] in that circumstance here's what they
[1:07:18] should have

[1:07:37] about it how much different it would be
[1:07:40] oh God you know what we need to do
[1:07:42] sometimes when the waves are swamping
[1:07:44] our boat we need to stop one time and
[1:07:46] have a testimony service and remember
[1:07:48] what he did last time and talk about
[1:07:50] what he did to our brother and to our
[1:07:52] sister and to me and how he brought me
[1:07:53] to the message and how he cleaned me up
[1:07:55] and saved me and delivered me things
[1:07:57] that I could never get over and things I
[1:07:59] tried all my life and when I come to the
[1:08:01] Lord when his when he filled me with his
[1:08:02] Spirit he took the desire out of me and
[1:08:04] I've got victory over that thing for 20
[1:08:06] years now 20 plus years amen what was
[1:08:09] that that was the power of God and he
[1:08:11] who delivered me there is still in the
[1:08:13] ship the one who fed 5,000 is in me amen

[1:09:05] vessel we have to learn how to rein the
[1:09:08] feelings back in and say you know what I
[1:09:10] feel like All Is Lost but nothing's out
[1:09:12] of
[1:09:13] cater there's nothing wrong with feel

[1:09:30] to stay the same way forever so just let
[1:09:32] the feel say Lord I feel this but I know
[1:09:35] your word says
[1:09:37] this Lord I feel like there's no hope
[1:09:40] but I know there's always hope because
[1:09:42] you got a plan for me from before the
[1:09:44] foundation of the world and nothing is
[1:09:45] going to change the plan you have of
[1:09:48] me amen you you you you wrote my name in
[1:09:52] your book you sealed it amen amen and
[1:09:54] there's no way that nothing there's no
[1:09:57] way that I'm going to be destroyed
[1:09:58] there's no way I'm going to miss the
[1:09:59] mark there's no way I'm going to miss
[1:10:00] your purpose for
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:03] me we need to speak the word amen we
[1:10:06] need to let the word come out of our
[1:10:09] mouths amen let's go to Romans I want to
[1:10:11] go to a scripture in
[1:10:14] Romans Romans chapter
[1:10:22] 10 Romans chap 10:5
[1:10:33] Romans 10:5 for Moses described the
[1:10:35] righteousness which is of the law that
[1:10:38] the man which doeth those things shall
[1:10:39] live by them but the righteousness which
[1:10:42] is of Faith speak on on this wise say
[1:10:45] not in thy heart who shall Ascend to
[1:10:47] Heaven that is to bring Christ down from
[1:10:48] above or who shall descend into the
[1:10:50] depth that is to bring Christ up again
[1:10:52] from the dead but what saith it the word
[1:10:55] is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in
[1:10:59] thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:11:02] which we
[1:11:03] preach how far away is
[1:11:06] he how far away is he he's given us his
[1:11:10] word amen not that we have to go pull
[1:11:13] him down from heaven or bring him up
[1:11:14] from below it's not the word is nigh
[1:11:16] thee even in thy mouth our Victory is
[1:11:19] here with
[1:11:20] us he's given us a mouth to speak his
[1:11:23] word God Amen it doesn't you can't stop
[1:11:27] from feeling
[1:11:29] afraid just try sometimes say okay I
[1:11:32] decided I'm not afraid
[1:11:34] anymore it's not going to work I just I
[1:11:37] decided I'm not I decided I'm not going
[1:11:40] to let that bother me anymore I mean
[1:11:42] we're fooling
[1:11:45] ourselves the reality is God this thing
[1:11:48] that's happening is scaring me but I
[1:11:51] know greater is he that's in me than
[1:11:53] he's that in the world and I know for
[1:11:54] sure this thing's not going to destroy
[1:11:56] me I know for sure that your plan for me
[1:12:00] is steadfast I know for sure that you're
[1:12:02] not changing in your thoughts towards me
[1:12:03] I know for sure you have a plan and I
[1:12:05] need to just sit still and wait these
[1:12:07] waves are no big
[1:12:09] deal amen cuz you're in the
[1:12:13] boat praise be to
[1:12:18] God he says in the message again he
[1:12:21] that's in you when he come to the Red
[1:12:24] Sea and it was in his way God said speak
[1:12:27] to the Sea and Moses spoke to the Sea
[1:12:30] and greater is he that was in Moses than
[1:12:32] the sea was
[1:12:35] itself is that
[1:12:38] right God didn't speak to the Sea he
[1:12:41] told Moses to speak to the Sea because
[1:12:44] he told Moses I will certainly be with
[1:12:46] thee because I'm sending
[1:12:53] you now you see greater was that was in
[1:12:55] Moses than he that's in the world
[1:12:57] greater is he that was in Moses than any
[1:12:59] nature there is in the world he
[1:13:01] commanded nature at whatever God told
[1:13:03] him to say he said it and that's the way
[1:13:05] it was the same God is with us tonight
[1:13:09] not only with us but in us he proves he
[1:13:13] was in US greater is he that is in you
[1:13:15] than he that is in the world Amen what
[1:13:18] are we afraid of the
[1:13:21] world there's nothing to be afraid of
[1:13:24] friends
[1:13:25] amen the the like I said we live we're
[1:13:28] human beings we live in a world we live
[1:13:30] a human life and God intended for us to
[1:13:32] human live a human life we feel the
[1:13:34] things the world feels we we have the
[1:13:37] reactions to certain things that the
[1:13:38] world has we can be fearful we can be
[1:13:40] perplexed we can be
[1:13:42] confused we can be confused even about
[1:13:44] what God is doing in our
[1:13:47] lives but it doesn't change anything the
[1:13:51] reality is still the same he's in the
[1:13:53] boat
[1:13:56] he's with us he's in US circumstances
[1:14:00] can't change
[1:14:02] that am where is go where is the king
[1:14:06] he's in Zion amen where's the Lord he's
[1:14:09] in Zion where is the king he's in
[1:14:12] her what shall destroy me when he's with
[1:14:17] me and if he's with me the only thing
[1:14:20] that can happen is whatever this is that
[1:14:22] looks like it'll destroy me can only
[1:14:23] carry me to the next dimension cuz he's
[1:14:25] in me the Kingdom's already
[1:14:29] here we don't have to be afraid we don't
[1:14:32] have to be perplex we don't have to
[1:14:33] worry we can come back to the word and
[1:14:35] say God greater is he that's in me than
[1:14:39] he that's in the
[1:14:40] world will things happen
[1:14:44] absolutely do you think you'll ever be
[1:14:46] afraid
[1:14:49] again but where will he
[1:14:51] be in the time of
[1:14:54] trouble where will he be the next
[1:14:57] situation that we can't solve or figure
[1:14:59] out where will Christ be the next time
[1:15:03] that circumstances start to mount so
[1:15:05] fast we feel like we're drowning where
[1:15:06] will he be he'll be the same place he's
[1:15:08] always been he'll be in
[1:15:12] you man help me
[1:15:15] God not to run all over the place like a
[1:15:19] wild man trying to find somebody with an
[1:15:22] answer the one with the answers inside
[1:15:26] he may bring it through a brother in the
[1:15:28] pull pit he may bring it through a
[1:15:29] brother and sister in a conversation he
[1:15:31] may allow somebody with a gift but it's
[1:15:33] still him inside of me has to bring it
[1:15:35] to a reality amen still the faith that's
[1:15:38] in me has to say that's nothing but the
[1:15:41] truth and that's for me men if we
[1:15:45] believe we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:15:46] we've got nothing to be afraid of we've
[1:15:49] got nothing to worry about we have
[1:15:51] nothing that we need to lose our minds
[1:15:53] over everything is
[1:15:55] okay and what the disciples should have
[1:15:58] said was that's no big
[1:16:01] deal well I mean I'm paraphrasing but
[1:16:04] that's pretty much what he
[1:16:05] said let me read it
[1:16:07] again now those disciples should have
[1:16:09] had said why there's nothing wrong
[1:16:12] now why there lays the Creator laying
[1:16:15] right
[1:16:19] here
[1:16:21] amen life
[1:16:23] happens but God doesn't
[1:16:26] change circumstances change but God's
[1:16:29] word never
[1:16:30] changes if he said he's with you always
[1:16:33] even to the end of the world that's a
[1:16:35] promise if he says he's in you say
[1:16:37] greater than he that's in you than he
[1:16:39] that's in the world that can never
[1:16:41] change next time we meet an obstacle we
[1:16:45] just need to hold
[1:16:46] steady quit running quit jumping quit
[1:16:49] getting scared just hold steady and say
[1:16:52] God I don't exactly know what you're
[1:16:54] doing and I don't exactly know how to
[1:16:55] move forward but I know one thing for
[1:16:57] sure you're still with me you have not
[1:17:00] left me you have not forsaken me you
[1:17:02] have not changed your mind about me you
[1:17:04] have not changed your word one iota I
[1:17:05] know you're with me and I know you have
[1:17:07] a plan so I'm asking God that you help
[1:17:10] me each step of the way because I don't
[1:17:12] know what's happening
[1:17:14] now but you know what these waves are
[1:17:17] not a big deal because the big deal is
[1:17:20] inside of
[1:17:22] me the one who created the world is in
[1:17:26] me the one who spoke the world into
[1:17:29] existence is still dwelling me his
[1:17:31] spirit is still dwelling in me I have
[1:17:34] nothing to worry about if he needs to
[1:17:36] part the waters he can still part the
[1:17:37] waters if he needs me to walk on the
[1:17:40] waters human beings can still walk on
[1:17:43] water I can't pretend I can't fake I
[1:17:45] can't make it happen but he
[1:17:47] can he that's in you is greater than he
[1:17:51] that's in the
[1:17:52] world Amen let's all stand
[1:17:57] together I think we're going to remind
[1:17:59] ourselves of these as often as we
[1:18:02] can cuz times are not getting less
[1:18:05] complicated they're getting more
[1:18:06] complicated and news is not getting less
[1:18:09] frightening it's getting more
[1:18:10] frightening but greater is he that's in
[1:18:13] you than he that's in the world there's
[1:18:15] wars and rumors of wars and pestilence
[1:18:17] and all kinds of troubles all over the
[1:18:19] place but it doesn't change anything
[1:18:22] really God knew what he was going to do
[1:18:25] in 2024 and he knows what he's going to
[1:18:26] do in 2025 if there is a 2025 God knows
[1:18:29] all about it we have no clue but he
[1:18:33] does so I need not to let the news and
[1:18:36] the circumstances and all the situations
[1:18:38] cause me to lose sight of what is so
[1:18:41] important to
[1:18:42] remember it's no big
[1:18:45] deal I don't mean that trivial but in
[1:18:48] the spirit it's
[1:18:49] true in the real reality it's true in my
[1:18:54] flesh I can't help it sometimes I still
[1:18:57] get worked up I still get I still get
[1:18:59] knots in my stomach over certain
[1:19:02] situations I mean I'm not I'm not
[1:19:05] preaching anything that I'm not
[1:19:08] experiencing I still have situations
[1:19:10] don't know how to solve I get knots in
[1:19:11] my stomach over certain things because I
[1:19:13] don't know how they're going to
[1:19:14] transpire I don't know the way out I
[1:19:16] don't know what's going to happen next
[1:19:17] but I got to keep reminding myself he
[1:19:20] knows he
[1:19:22] knows he knows what's happen happening I
[1:19:25] don't know what's happening he knows
[1:19:26] what's happening and when he got into
[1:19:29] that boat with the disciples he had a
[1:19:31] purpose in getting in the boat amen cuz
[1:19:33] he was going to go to the other
[1:19:36] side you know when God got in this boat
[1:19:38] of me he had a purpose he was going to
[1:19:41] get it to the other side and it's going
[1:19:43] to get to the other side I don't know if
[1:19:45] the storms are going to rise or not rise
[1:19:47] I don't know if the sails will break or
[1:19:48] not break I don't know what's going to
[1:19:49] happen but if he got in this boat to go
[1:19:51] to the other side he's going to go to
[1:19:53] the other side amen
[1:19:55] and I've Got Confidence in that and say
[1:19:58] God remind us of these things let us re
[1:20:01] rehearse them in times of trouble when
[1:20:03] chaos breaks out let's be reminded that
[1:20:06] he's in the
[1:20:07] ship and let's bow our heads and pray
[1:20:09] together dear heavenly father we thank
[1:20:12] you God that your word is ever
[1:20:15] true God we're learning as your bride to
[1:20:18] depend on the word above everything else
[1:20:22] you're speaking to us time and time
[1:20:24] again show showing us that the word is
[1:20:25] the only way that you made promises and
[1:20:29] your promises remain true that your word
[1:20:31] doesn't Fade with time it doesn't grow
[1:20:34] weaker Lord but it's as powerful as it's
[1:20:36] ever been that the promise is
[1:20:39] sure God I pray that it becomes more of
[1:20:42] a reality to us day by
[1:20:44] day there's a reason you speak these
[1:20:47] things to us because we need to be
[1:20:49] reminded because we are your victory in
[1:20:52] this time you want to overcome through
[1:20:55] each one of us Lord and you need us just
[1:20:58] to hold steady and trust you you need us
[1:21:02] to believe you Lord in the midst of
[1:21:04] chaos you need us just to let you have
[1:21:08] your way and show yourself Mighty on our
[1:21:11] behalf that you might get the victory
[1:21:14] through us and we can be your victory in
[1:21:17] this end
[1:21:18] time lord Jesus I'm
[1:21:21] sorry I'm sorry that I've run to other
[1:21:24] sources
[1:21:25] sorry that I've been afraid and tried to
[1:21:27] solve my own
[1:21:29] problems God if you'll forgive me Lord
[1:21:32] and strengthen me God I want to serve
[1:21:35] you with all of my heart and I want to
[1:21:37] be pleasing to you and I want to learn
[1:21:40] to trust you despite the
[1:21:43] circumstances Lord I want to learn to
[1:21:46] overcome even my own emotions and my own
[1:21:48] feelings and my own thinking and my own
[1:21:51] reasoning and I want to cast it all down
[1:21:55] so that you can take the preeminent
[1:21:56] place in my
[1:21:58] life God I believe you're training us
[1:22:00] for this
[1:22:01] now God help
[1:22:04] us Lord I believe that you're in our
[1:22:08] ship I believe it Lord not just when
[1:22:12] it's smooth sailing but in Troublesome
[1:22:14] times that you're still in the ship and
[1:22:17] I believe it Lord for you say greater is
[1:22:20] he that's in me than he that's in the
[1:22:23] world
[1:22:24] if that's true Lord then there's nothing
[1:22:26] we have to be afraid
[1:22:28] of God let that truth become Superior in
[1:22:31] our hearts and our lives thank you for
[1:22:34] the reminder Lord for surely we need it
[1:22:38] surely we'll need it in the days that
[1:22:39] lay
[1:22:41] ahead Lord I Thank you that you reminded
[1:22:44] us once again may this word go into our
[1:22:47] hearts Lord and may it root itself down
[1:22:50] there and spring forth life and may it
[1:22:53] not just be something that hit our ears
[1:22:55] and tingled in our minds but Lord may it
[1:22:58] be something that becomes part of us a
[1:23:00] reality Lord that we lean on that we
[1:23:02] trust in that we act upon we love you
[1:23:06] father we thank you for your word we ask

[1:23:16] refresh him and bless him in all his
[1:23:18] travels and that you would use him as a
[1:23:20] vessel Lord that you can speak through
[1:23:23] and may we have the witness in our heart
[1:23:24] heart to ears to hear all that you're
[1:23:26] trying to say to us may you bring us

[1:23:37] pray we thank you Father
[1:23:40] amen and God bless you all brother
[1:23:44] John as I look back in
[1:23:48] history I see a mighty God unveiled
[1:23:55] proving over and
[1:23:58] over that his word will never
[1:24:04] fail but I'm not just
[1:24:09] dwelling on a past
[1:24:15] memory for he's the same God he's
