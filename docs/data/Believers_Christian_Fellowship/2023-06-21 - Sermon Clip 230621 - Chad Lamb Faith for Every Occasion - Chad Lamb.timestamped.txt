[0:00] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[0:03] and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[0:07] imprisonment
[0:08] they were stoned they were Saun asunder
[0:11] were tempted were slain with the sword
[0:14] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[0:16] goat skins being destitute and afflicted
[0:20] tormented
[0:22] how did they do this by faith
[0:26] you mean by faith I am afflicted
[0:29] by faith you can be afflicted
[0:33] I was always taught that perfect Faith
[0:35] would keep me from anything bad ever
[0:37] happening to me and I'd be healed and
[0:39] I'd be delivered and ever
[0:41] that's true
[0:43] but sometimes that same faith that
[0:46] they'll deliver you
[0:48] that will deliver you from torture that
[0:51] will deliver you from Affliction that'll
[0:52] deliver you from being destitute amen
[0:54] that same faith that will bring that is
[0:56] the same faith that will carry you
[0:58] through it and it delivers you a
[0:59] different way
[1:01] it delivers you from falling into
[1:03] unbelief it delivers you from falling
[1:05] away it delivers you from doubting God
[1:07] it delivers you from walking away
[1:11] when everything goes wrong amen there's
[1:13] a faith that holds amen and that's a
[1:16] measure that's given by God
[1:21] okay
[1:22] oh when I read through this all of a
[1:24] sudden something inside me just begins
[1:26] to Quake amen because it wasn't what we
[1:29] read through the Bible and we see
[1:30] deliverance and miracles and but it
[1:33] wasn't all deliverance and miracles amen
[1:35] amen sometimes amen God Amen had to
[1:39] display himself in all kinds of forms
[1:41] and his attribute in all kinds of ways
[1:43] and his children had faith for every
[1:45] obstacle they had faith for every trial
[1:48] and had faith for every occasion
[1:51] they had faith for the deliverance and
[1:53] they had faith when they went through
[1:54] the fire
[1:56] they had faith for both why because they
[1:59] never quit believing they never doubted
[2:00] God they never doubted his promise they
[2:02] never doubted his word
[2:04] they died in faith
[2:07] amen
[2:08] let's keep reading read this again they
[2:11] wondered about sheepskins and ghost
[2:12] skins being destitute Afflicted
[2:14] tormented of whom the world was not
[2:17] worthy they wandered in deserts how by
[2:21] faith and in mountains and in dens the
[2:23] caves of the earth and these all having
[2:26] obtained a good report through faith
[2:28] receive not the promise God having
[2:30] provided some better thing for us a day
[2:32] without us should not be made perfect
[2:36] praise God
[2:39] they obtained a good report through
[2:41] faith
[2:43] they obtained a good report although
[2:44] they were afflicted
[2:46] but to God they had a good report
[2:49] man may not have understood their
[2:51] Affliction and their destitute in their
[2:52] sheepskins and and goat skins and living
[2:55] in caves and dens of the rocks it looked
[2:57] like they were Outcast it looked like
[2:58] they were not blessed it looked like
[3:00] they were the ones that God wasn't
[3:01] blessing amen but they obtained a good
[3:03] report by faith because Faith would not
[3:06] let them leave the promising word of God
[3:08] for nothing for no circumstance for no
[3:11] situation would they leave the word
