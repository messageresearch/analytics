[0:00] so much of life is
[0:03] just life carnal things that will fade
[0:06] away but there's a depth of reality
[0:09] that's inside of us and it's the most
[0:10] exciting thing in the world it's from
[0:13] out of this world when you realize that
[0:16] that that c genit in you that's part of
[0:18] the life of God that's part of the word
[0:20] that's part of Christ amen and when it
[0:22] was quick in life it was always there
[0:24] what is in you now is the same thing
[0:26] that's in the Lamb's Book of Life it's
[0:28] not like that name written there
[0:30] something different than what you are
[0:31] here the real you on the inside behind
[0:33] the veil that you dwell in is whatever
[0:35] was written in that book
[0:38] amen that's why when the lamb took the
[0:41] book it Thrills us yeah amen what makes
[0:44] us so excited even when brother brandom
[0:46] says and the lamb has to take the book
[0:48] and open the seals and we're all like
[0:49] yes amen what does it mean it's not that
[0:52] he's walking around with the book well I
[0:53] mean that's not the exciting part the
[0:55] exciting part is I don't know how I
[0:57] don't know how it come into me to know
[0:59] this but but I know when the lamb takes
[1:01] the book it has something to do with me
[1:04] I don't know it here but when I hear
[1:06] brother brandom say it in the breach I
[1:08] know it down here when when the people
[1:10] are shouting I'm shouting when I look at
[1:12] John when John sees the lamb step
[1:14] forward when no man was worthy to take
[1:16] the book and he hears that the lion of
[1:18] the tribe of Judah has overcome and
[1:20] prevailed to take the book and he looks
[1:22] and he sees a bloody lamb and the Bloody
[1:24] lamb takes the book and when the bloody
[1:25] lamb takes the book and everybody falls
[1:28] down on their face and then John says
[1:30] and everything in heaven and everything
[1:32] on Earth and everything under the Earth
[1:34] heard I John shouting praises and glory
[1:37] and Hallelujah why because John knew
[1:40] he's in the book brother Bram said he
[1:43] must have looked over and saw his name
[1:44] in the book how did he see his name in
[1:46] the book it was still sealed amen I
[1:49] don't know how he saw it with carnal
[1:51] natural eyes but something in John knew
[1:53] he was part of that book and if no man
[1:57] took the book all was lost amen
[2:00] what was John re re rejoicing about
[2:03] because by Revelation he knew he was
[2:05] part of that book what is so exciting
[2:07] about this message is by revelation we
[2:09] know we're part of the
[2:11] book part of the book is in me and the
[2:14] life of Christ is here living out that
[2:17] book it's the book of the life of the
[2:21] Lamb amen his life on display on the
[2:25] earth that's what's recorded in the book
[2:27] and I'm part of that book and the book
[2:30] is alive in me amen
