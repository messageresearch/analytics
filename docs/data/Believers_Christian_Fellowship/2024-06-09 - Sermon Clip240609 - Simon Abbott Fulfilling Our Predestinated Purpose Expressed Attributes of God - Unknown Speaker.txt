TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I want you to I want you to get this home you would not misquote like Satan did in the beginning Thou shalt not surely die is there anybody in here that is ever tempted to add one word or take one word from it then why don't we live the life because you are the word of God expressed see on one hand we we've got such respect for this that we would never misrepresent or misquote this and yet he's saying that this is you so we've got to be so careful that day by day every day that we live if no one's watching you and you're going down the 75 home and you know you're doing 80 when you're supposed to do 70 he's watching you someone's watching you somewhere what is it this level of responsibility it's this sincerity that we have to come to you would not misrepresent the scriptures don't misrepresent your life because your life is the scripture amen you are the written Epistles of God read of all men come on you have been chosen to display this message and everything around the message to the world you listen you've been chosen before the foundation of the world to hold the sword of the Lord amen think of it the word and he shaped us just like he shaped brother mam he shaped each one of us in such a way that we are so so we feel we are just so seems like we're battered you know at the end of the day my old nana I mean Anna used to love cooking jam tarts for me they were the best but you know when she'd been making the old bow to get it into shape she'd give it a good slapping you know what I mean if you want to get it into shape you've got to give it a slap you know what I mean and that's kind of how it is we've been shaped we aren't just here like that we've been shaped not only by our parents we've been shaped by all those Generations back everything so listen we have to listen carefully we have to manifest God so perfectly to the full capacity in this day that you have got to be shaped to Perfection Perfection does not mean we look like some kind of sweet guy on the outside Perfection means your character
