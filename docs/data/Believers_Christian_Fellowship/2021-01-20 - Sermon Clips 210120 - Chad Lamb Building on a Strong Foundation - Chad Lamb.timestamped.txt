[0:00] he was crying out to the son of david
[0:03] he recognized that this is prophecy
[0:05] being fulfilled
[0:07] the pharisees wouldn't say that amen
[0:09] some of the other in the malta
[0:10] wouldn't say that but there was a blind
[0:12] man there who caught a revelation
[0:14] and said this is the very prophecy being
[0:16] fulfilled in our day
[0:18] and he cried out thou son of david and
[0:20] they were trying to get him to be quiet
[0:22] but jesus heard what he said and he said
[0:24] bring him to me
[0:25] he said what do you want he said i want
[0:26] to receive my side he said then receive
[0:28] your sight
[0:29] that you are saved your faith has saved
[0:31] you
[0:32] see he he had the capacity
[0:36] to believe that this was the day for the
[0:38] prophecy to be fulfilled
[0:41] others were doubting others were
[0:42] questioning others were mocking and
[0:45] saying horrible names about jesus but
[0:47] here was a little blind man
[0:48] amen who said down in his heart he said
[0:50] this is the son of david
[0:52] this is the prophecy this is the messiah
[0:57] god could see his faith there was a
[1:00] little woman
[1:01] who knew down in her heart that if i
[1:02] could but touch the hem of his garment
[1:04] i could be made every bit whole amen you
[1:07] realize
[1:08] friends this isn't it it's not that that
[1:11] she was repeating when anybody else had
[1:12] done this wasn't
[1:14] five steps to salvation this wasn't this
[1:16] wasn't the romans road to the sinner's
[1:18] prayer
[1:18] amen this was a spontaneous reaction
[1:21] amen an inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:23] amen where there was a seed on the
[1:25] inside that could recognize
[1:26] this man can help me and something is
[1:29] telling me that if i could just touch
[1:30] the hem of his garment i could be made
[1:32] every bit whole
[1:34] this is real salvation this is real
[1:36] christianity this is not this is far
[1:38] beyond formalism and far beyond
[1:40] repeating after me and far beyond
[1:42] this step and this step and this step
[1:44] amen it's it's something that's
[1:46] down inside of an individual amen she
[1:48] may not have known she had that kind of
[1:50] faith amen the blind man didn't know he
[1:52] had that kind of faith the woman that
[1:54] washed jesus feet she may not have known
[1:55] she had that kind of faith but when she
[1:57] come in contact with the living word for
[1:59] her day
[2:00] something inside of her said i got to
[2:02] get to him i've got to wash his feet
[2:05] amen when when blind bartimaeus was
[2:07] sitting at the
[2:08] the gate in jericho and he heard who was
[2:11] passing by
[2:12] amen that spontaneous well of faith came
[2:14] up and said thou
[2:15] son of david this is my chance this is
[2:18] the word for the hour
[2:19] this is the prophecy this is my time i'm
[2:22] calling out to you
[2:23] oh god save me
[2:26] do you think it'll be any different for
[2:28] us in this day amen what do we need to
[2:30] do whatever god is moving in your heart
[2:32] to do
[2:33] but to recognize who is here amen the
[2:36] prophecies being fulfilled the word is
[2:38] made manifest
[2:38] you can see the son you can hear his
[2:41] void the voice of the lord
[2:42] and you can respond in whatever way god
[2:45] is inspiring you to respond but he will
[2:47] see your faith and impute unto your
[2:49] righteousness
