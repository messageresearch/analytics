it didn't have the feel it didn't have the click it didn't seem to hit and I'll go home in Despair and I'll go home but I know the word was true it wasn't we were preaching false it was the message we read the quotes we read the script we knew it was the truth but somehow for me it just felt flat inevitably those are the service I get the most text messages where somebody said that was exactly for me that was the conversation we had on the way to church that was what I talked to my coworker about and I said oh God I'm sorry sorry God's trying to wean me off of feelings it doesn't matter how I feel while I preach if I don't deliver the word it doesn't do anything amen but if we can deliver the word and if I feel good praise God if I don't feel good praise God as long as the word is being preached it'll affect the lives of God's children cuz the word Works anywhere anytime under any condition and it never fails so if everybody's standing on their feet and waving their arms it'll work if it's the word if they're standing on the feet and waving their arms if it's some intellectual talk if it's some psychology some feel-good something it's not going to do anything but if everybody's sitting in their seats writing down notes Whispering an amen and if it's the word they'll go home delivered if they believe that word amen we got to wean ourselves off of feelings I love the feelings let's have them every service but if we don't have them don't call it a failure if it's the preaching of the word it can't fail the word Can't Fail amen amen so we got to we got to get weaned off of these feelings where one service that was a good service what was good about it it just had that that feeling that service wasn't any good why wasn't it good I don't know the things he were saying just kind of stepped on my toes and I left not feeling good the question and how you felt the question is was it the word whether you felt condemned attacked convicted whether you felt exalted whether you felt lifted up whether you felt whatever you felt it doesn't matter what you felt the question is was it the word we got to get weaned off of feelings and get back to the word it's the word it's the word it's the word what was brother brandham emphasizing over and over what was the third pull it was the opening of the word I mean what was the climax of his mystery it was the revealing of the word it's all the word friends what did he how did Christ come to us in this age he came as the revealed word right how did he Unite with his bride what was the headship the headship was the headship of the word that had come back it's the word that we're looking for not feelings feelings will come feelings will go as long as we're in the flesh feelings will be all over the place but the word will never change God give me the strength to say Amen to the word when everything in me feels like crawling in a hole and dying I want to say Amen the word still the truth yes
