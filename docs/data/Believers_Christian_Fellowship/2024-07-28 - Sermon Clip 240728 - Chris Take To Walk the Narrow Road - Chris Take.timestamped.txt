[0:00] if there ever was a time and this brings
[0:02] us right back down to our point about
[0:04] the separation if there ever was a time
[0:07] that the Church of Christ needs its eyes
[0:09] opened it's today some more breaking
[0:12] bread their eyes were open and they
[0:14] recognized that it was him oh friend has
[0:18] he ever opened your eyes that way has he
[0:20] ever blessed you in such a way has he
[0:23] ever broke you apart from the things of
[0:25] the world because we are to be a type of
[0:28] Christ so we must be
[0:32] broken we must be
[0:35] broken go go back and listen to
[0:37] Masterpiece he has ever broke you apart
[0:40] from the things of the world separated
[0:41] you a breaking and an opening time
[0:45] that's what the church needs today is a
[0:47] breaking and an opening time you see it
[0:50] was twofold the breaking of the bread
[0:52] and the opening of their eyes if you go
[0:55] back and you and you listen to brother
[0:57] Bram the angel begins to tell him before
[0:58] The Reeling of the seals you need to be
[1:00] more
[1:01] sincere you see the seals and the
[1:04] opening of the word and those final
[1:05] years of his ministry that was the
[1:07] transition that was the word for the
[1:10] transition to move the bride from the
[1:12] church that's why it had to be recorded
[1:14] because we needed it this
[1:16] day that that transition in order to
[1:19] reach that he's the wave sheath right
[1:21] he's the one there first if you will so
[1:25] he what is whatever he needed to do be
[1:27] more sincere than you must as well am
[1:30] God is calling us to be more sincere to
[1:33] let go of the apathy of the age that we
[1:35] live in I mean everywhere you look it's
[1:37] laziness just just laziness unconcerned
[1:41] brother preach that message
[1:42] unconcerned you must be convinced and
[1:44] then concerned because something inside
[1:46] of you says this is really really really
[1:48] really important that's right I I this
[1:50] is very important the angel tells him
[1:52] you've got to be more sincere you're
[1:55] talking about the prophet amen what a
[1:57] position we have to attain to and I
[2:00] don't say that to discourage you I say
[2:02] that to encourage you to inspire you if
[2:04] you will just be more sincere that thing
[2:06] in your life that you want to take care
[2:07] of that that even your church friends
[2:09] say what's the big deal with that but
[2:12] God's calling you to let it go he's
[2:15] calling you higher because there's a
[2:17] highway and there's a way there's a way
[2:20] and that way leadth
[2:22] unto somebody say it unto
[2:26] life there is a way and that way leadth
[2:29] unto life he is the way the truth and
[2:32] the life and the truth shall set you
[2:34] free
