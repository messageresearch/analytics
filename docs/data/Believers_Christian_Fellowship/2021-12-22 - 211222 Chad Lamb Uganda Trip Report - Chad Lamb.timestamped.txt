[5:50] i just showed up at the church at 6 30

[6:14] as we get started lord jesus we thank
[6:16] you for the privilege to be together
[6:18] lord when there's been an absence lord
[6:20] it means so much to us to be able to
[6:22] gather again and see one another's faces
[6:25] and worship together lord as we are your
[6:28] children sitting at your feet lord
[6:29] basking in your glory lifting our voices
[6:31] to seeing of your greatness lord
[6:34] god i pray that you bless us tonight as
[6:36] i share lord the things that have been
[6:38] going on the last two weeks and the
[6:40] blessings that we've had with our
[6:41] brother abraham and lord may you just
[6:44] give us inspiration out of your word to
[6:46] keep moving forward and pressing forward
[6:48] and that each one of us will take our
[6:49] position and take our place and do as
[6:51] you've called us to do
[6:53] and god we just thank you for the
[6:54] privilege of once again opening your
[6:57] word and reading out of it together and
[6:59] blessing your name bless us lord and
[7:01] guide us in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:04] amen
[7:05] while you're yet standing let's turn to
[7:07] the book of proverbs
[7:08] proverbs chapter 25.
[7:15] we'll read one scripture and let you
[7:17] have your seat
[7:21] proverbs 25
[7:23] verse 25.
[7:25] i may cough a little bit tonight don't
[7:27] worry about me
[7:28] i went from
[7:30] lima ohio to tropical along the equator
[7:34] back to lima ohio amen so my sinuses
[7:37] don't know what to do but that's okay
[7:39] and as i keep preaching to keep speaking
[7:41] it'll blow it out and they'll get
[7:42] clearer and clearer so it doesn't bother
[7:44] me don't let it bother you but it seems
[7:46] like whenever i travel i have a little
[7:48] bit of trouble those air air
[7:50] conditioning on the plane first they fry
[7:52] they roast you and then they freeze you
[7:53] and when you're ball headed you know you
[7:55] get hot sitting there waiting and then
[7:57] you lit little beads of sweat on your
[7:59] head and then as soon as they're ready
[8:00] to take off they blast cold air right
[8:02] across your head and i thought mom i'm
[8:04] gonna have to start wearing a toupee
[8:09] so i don't get horses amen
[8:11] so i know what brother branham was
[8:13] talking about
[8:14] but let's look here proverbs 25 25
[8:18] as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is
[8:21] good news from a far country amen god
[8:24] bless you you may have your seats may
[8:26] the lord refresh you with good news from
[8:29] a far country
[8:31] i start off by just thanking everybody
[8:33] for your prayers we certainly needed it
[8:35] amen it's a long tiring trip but
[8:39] god is good
[8:40] excuse me
[8:43] when we got there it was like i said it
[8:45] was hot and humid
[8:47] and dusty
[8:48] and my it was just it's rough and i
[8:51] don't know if i'm starting to get older
[8:53] or what but i don't do as good as i used
[8:54] to i used to be like a boy scout none of
[8:56] that stuff bothered me but
[8:58] now my i just it is a hot car with no
[9:01] air conditioning with the windows down
[9:03] on a dusty road
[9:04] for seven hours bumping along and dust
[9:07] blowing all over you and
[9:09] my goodness i'm not i'm not as hardy as
[9:12] i used to be that's what i found out i
[9:14] haven't traveled overseas for two years
[9:15] so i guess you get out of practice a
[9:17] little bit
[9:18] but i appreciate your prayers it was
[9:20] needful and i was a beneficiary of that
[9:22] and i appreciate that and all of you who
[9:24] checked on my family while i was going i
[9:26] really appreciate that that's real real
[9:27] blessing to me so thank you for that and
[9:30] and
[9:31] those who are checking on one another
[9:33] and
[9:33] i just thank god that everybody's doing
[9:35] well also
[9:37] angie told me that there's a lot of
[9:38] christmas cards waiting for me to read
[9:40] when i get home and
[9:41] treats and cookies and gifts and all
[9:44] kinds of good stuff so i can't wait to
[9:46] get home amen
[9:47] so god bless you thank you all for that
[9:49] that means a lot to us your
[9:50] thoughtfulness for our family always
[9:52] means a lot we're always blown away by
[9:54] how good you are to us and we really
[9:56] appreciate it it means a lot to us so
[9:58] i'm looking forward to sitting down and
[10:00] reading through the cards and looking
[10:01] through the pictures and all of that
[10:03] also want to really thank the brothers
[10:04] who ministered for us while i was away i
[10:07] think brother kyle brother kyle pulled
[10:09] double duty he had service here sunday
[10:11] then he took care of the outreach
[10:13] service over at the yoders in the amish
[10:15] country for us the following sunday so
[10:17] we appreciate that and brother ben took
[10:19] the wednesday service we appreciate that
[10:21] and also brother nathaniel cyrus for
[10:23] coming down that was a real blessing and
[10:25] then brother ben had probably the worst
[10:27] job of all because he was emergency on
[10:29] deck in case my flights didn't work out
[10:31] he was going to have to preach tonight
[10:33] so i mean
[10:35] it's rough when you know you got to
[10:36] preach to catch inspiration but it's
[10:37] worse when you're trying to study not
[10:39] knowing if you're going to preach or not
[10:40] amen so that's a hard spot to be in and
[10:42] you can get a call last minute that
[10:44] you're on go so i appreciate that
[10:46] brother ben thank you for sacrificing
[10:48] for me and i appreciate that and i'm
[10:50] glad it worked out we could be here also
[10:52] brother abraham and sister rachel uh
[10:55] brother abraham's wife they wanted me to
[10:57] send special greetings to the church
[10:59] they really love you all and brother
[11:00] abraham's hoping to come back the first
[11:03] part of next year and so i'm hoping that
[11:05] we can get him here by spring and have
[11:07] some services together so that looks
[11:09] like the door might be opening and so we
[11:11] we hope that that will work out
[11:14] also
[11:15] uh i want to let you know i'll try to
[11:17] remember to announce it again at the end
[11:20] but uh
[11:21] i tried to find a little bit of candy or
[11:24] something for uganda to bring to the
[11:25] kids i always like to bring something
[11:26] for the kids if i can but uganda doesn't
[11:29] make their own candy
[11:30] and so
[11:31] whatever they have for candy you
[11:33] probably don't want
[11:34] but so when i was in amsterdam i found
[11:36] some chocolates made in amsterdam so you
[11:39] got the best amen you got good chocolate
[11:41] so all the kids after service there's a
[11:43] basket out at the welcome desk with
[11:45] chocolates
[11:46] freshly imported from amsterdam
[11:49] made in amsterdam freshly imported so
[11:52] grab one of those on your way out and we
[11:54] just want to say we love you and i hope
[11:56] that you enjoy that
[11:58] also we'll let you know we won't have
[11:59] prayer time this saturday it'll be
[12:02] christmas day
[12:03] and then we'll be going through the
[12:05] schedule for watch night we'll be having
[12:06] watch night next friday and no service
[12:09] that wednesday a week from today we
[12:10] won't be having any service
[12:13] i'd like to get into this powerpoint and
[12:15] show you some pictures
[12:16] of uganda
[12:18] excuse me
[12:20] so when we look at uganda uganda is
[12:23] called the pearl of africa i think they
[12:26] call themselves the pearl of africa i
[12:27] don't know if anybody else calls them
[12:28] the pearl of africa but it's on the sign
[12:30] as you come out of the airport the pearl
[12:32] of africa so
[12:33] i guess if that's what they want to be
[12:35] called
[12:36] but uh this is my second time being
[12:39] there i think i was there five or six
[12:40] years ago
[12:42] and uh not much has changed but you know
[12:45] it's a beautiful country you can see
[12:46] here that it's it's beautiful it still
[12:49] has some ruggedness to it it's still a
[12:51] bit wild in places and it's really
[12:53] beautiful but it's it's contrasted by
[12:55] poverty it's a very poor country
[12:58] and you can see here this is the big
[13:00] market in kampala
[13:02] so sisters if you want to go buy some
[13:04] glows
[13:05] are some shoes this is where you would
[13:06] do your shopping in kampala and you'd be
[13:09] on the street bartering for what you
[13:11] wanted so this is just kind of the way
[13:13] it is in uganda there's people
[13:14] everywhere and any of the brothers who
[13:16] traveled overseas in a third world
[13:17] country especially in africa or haiti
[13:19] you know what this scene is like
[13:22] but uh you can see here you can get
[13:24] fruit and watermelons and all kinds i
[13:26] mean anything you can get at this market
[13:29] so when you go to the market this is
[13:30] what the market's like they don't have
[13:32] much in the way of supermarkets like we
[13:33] would have
[13:35] and if you want fresh chicken for dinner
[13:37] this is how you get your chicken
[13:39] take it home and fix it up fresh so
[13:43] yeah so we see all kinds of motorcycles
[13:46] and bikes and stuff going by with
[13:48] chickens tied by their feet hanging off
[13:49] the sides like saddle bags going down
[13:51] the road or they'll be a pig across the
[13:53] back or something like that you know
[13:55] somebody's going to eat good tonight and
[13:57] they got some chicken going home or some
[13:59] pork or something
[14:01] so these are the scenes you get used to
[14:04] and i got a picture later on a video
[14:06] driving that you'll you'll see what it's
[14:07] like so it's it's so interesting when
[14:10] you travel
[14:11] and i thank god i've had the privilege
[14:13] to go see our brothers and sisters in
[14:15] other parts of the world just to get
[14:17] perspective because life is different
[14:19] life is difficult life is hard amen but
[14:22] you can see there's such a contrast in
[14:24] the way that we live our daily lives
[14:27] but when you go to fellowshipping on the
[14:28] word it's the exact same there's no
[14:30] difference at all so from across the
[14:33] world from different cultures and
[14:34] different lifestyles and
[14:36] and differences of all kinds when you
[14:39] sit down to fellowship on the word it's
[14:41] like you've known each other all your
[14:43] lives amen and you can sit and talk
[14:45] about the word you have such a common
[14:47] denominator across brethren around the
[14:49] world something that unites us stronger
[14:51] than any family bond any national bond
[14:54] any other bond and that bond is the word
[14:56] it's christ that's glued us together
[14:59] and so that's that's one of the greatest
[15:01] privileges of getting to travel
[15:04] next i want to show you brother
[15:05] abraham's new house he just finished a
[15:07] new house
[15:08] and it's very nice
[15:10] i looked at this house when i pulled up
[15:13] when we pulled in i said brother abraham
[15:15] and he just laughed
[15:16] because
[15:17] i was at his old house previously
[15:20] and brother abraham didn't have any
[15:23] facilities with which to take care of us
[15:26] um so it was really rough the the house
[15:28] that he was in was rough and he couldn't
[15:30] keep guests and and it was difficult so
[15:34] we had actually sent him some money when
[15:35] we knew he was going to try to build
[15:36] another house
[15:38] and we sent him some money and
[15:41] some other brother sent some money and
[15:43] it wasn't going to be this kind of a
[15:44] structure
[15:46] but um he started building it and he
[15:48] wanted a place really where he could
[15:50] host people at least have dinner in his
[15:52] home or when he has guests and things
[15:53] like that
[15:55] and there was a brother from somewhere i
[15:58] don't even know
[15:59] the brother wished to remain anonymous
[16:01] so i don't know who it is but the
[16:03] brother heard a testimony of a sister in
[16:06] norway the sister in norway was born
[16:09] mute and she was born blind and when
[16:11] brother abraham was in norway many years
[16:13] ago he prayed for her and god gave her
[16:15] the ability to speak she could now speak
[16:17] she was still blind but she could
[16:19] communicate she could speak
[16:22] and then after several years god just
[16:24] planted in her heart that if he can pray
[16:26] for me to speak he can pray for me to
[16:28] see
[16:29] and she had confidence that if she went
[16:31] to brother abraham and and prayed
[16:33] something lodged in her heart that
[16:36] kindness she went to uganda and had him
[16:38] pray that she would see
[16:41] and so she did she couldn't get anybody
[16:43] to go with her she went by herself this
[16:44] is a a blind woman who'd just been able
[16:48] to speak for a few years traveled by
[16:50] herself
[16:51] and went to see brother abraham and
[16:53] brother abraham prayed for her at the
[16:55] end of the service
[16:56] she sat through the service he called
[16:58] her up at the end he prayed for her
[17:00] then they went back to the to his house
[17:03] and they were eating around the in the
[17:05] living room there
[17:06] and
[17:07] uh she still couldn't see you know and
[17:10] her eyes were hurting her actually after
[17:12] the prayer and so she laid down she
[17:15] wasn't feeling very well then they were
[17:17] going to eat so she got up to eat
[17:19] and then when she was sitting there all
[17:20] of a sudden she screamed out because she
[17:23] could see she couldn't see much but she
[17:25] could see she could see that there was
[17:26] something on a plate
[17:28] and she began to scream and rejoice but
[17:31] she had just got it opened her eyes for
[17:32] the first time her whole life and it was
[17:34] so painful that next couple of days she
[17:37] laid down she stayed in the dark because
[17:38] the light hurt her eyes so bad so she
[17:40] went back to norway and she gradually
[17:43] improved and she's got uh she's got some
[17:46] degree of sight i don't think it's
[17:47] perfect side but she now can see she can
[17:49] now speak and she gave that testimony
[17:51] and that testimonies went out from
[17:53] norway so there was a brother who got
[17:54] intrigued about this and he made plans
[17:56] to travel to uganda and he went to
[17:58] uganda to see brother abraham because he
[18:00] wanted to see what kind of man this was
[18:02] and whether this was real or not i guess
[18:05] so he spent some time with brother
[18:07] abraham but brother abraham can't keep
[18:08] guests in his home so he has no
[18:10] facilities for gas no way to keep guests
[18:13] so
[18:14] every evening he has to drive it's about
[18:18] 30 minutes of look 30 minutes or a
[18:20] little over to the nearest city that has
[18:22] a hotel to put guests up in a hotel then
[18:24] he drives home and the next morning he
[18:26] goes and picks up his guest and comes
[18:27] back
[18:28] so he's driving two hours a day just to
[18:30] take care of his guests and the roads
[18:32] are rough it's not like 30 minutes going
[18:35] down
[18:36] i-75 but it's it really beats you up
[18:38] especially the first half of the trip
[18:40] really jostles you about and beat you up
[18:42] i don't know how many times my head
[18:43] slammed against the window when we hit a
[18:44] pothole and
[18:46] things like that so it's not an easy
[18:47] trip
[18:48] so this brother he stayed in the hotel
[18:50] so brother abraham was driving him back
[18:52] and forth and his brother happens to be
[18:54] an engineer and the brother said i want
[18:56] to finish building your house i want i
[18:59] want you to have a house where you can
[19:00] keep company i want you to have
[19:02] everything you need and the man took it
[19:04] upon himself to design the house and pay
[19:06] for everything to finish this house
[19:09] because he saw what brother abraham was
[19:11] doing because brother abram gets a lot
[19:12] of guests a lot of people come and see
[19:14] him from around africa from there in
[19:16] uganda and visitors from overseas so
[19:18] this this brother took it upon himself
[19:20] to finish this house and it's very nice
[19:23] for the standards there
[19:25] amen so to the right hand side now he
[19:29] has guest quarters which is where i got
[19:30] to stay and he's got two little bedrooms
[19:33] on the side of the house that are
[19:34] isolated by a door from the house two
[19:36] little bedrooms and a bathroom just for
[19:39] keeping company it's got its own outside
[19:41] door and it's got another door separated
[19:43] from the rest of the house you could go
[19:44] into to the dining room and so he's got
[19:47] a perfect place for keeping company now
[19:49] he doesn't have to do all that driving
[19:50] back and forth and
[19:52] it's much easier for the guests it's
[19:54] much easier for him but god bless that
[19:56] man that's what i say god he took it
[19:58] upon himself and he says you must have
[20:00] it this way this way this way this way
[20:02] and he wanted it to be just right and he
[20:04] saw the project all the way through to
[20:05] the end and so i'm really really
[20:08] thankful for that when i pulled in i
[20:10] said praise the lord because i knew this
[20:11] was where i'm going to be sleeping so
[20:13] my rejoicing was a little bit selfish
[20:15] you know
[20:17] but i was just i was just happy he's
[20:19] he's not on the grid he's on complete
[20:21] solar power
[20:24] also um all of the rain collection off
[20:26] the roof goes into some storage uh big
[20:29] water tanks in the back
[20:31] and for
[20:32] forever he's relied completely 100 on
[20:36] rainfall for water that's where he gets
[20:38] all of his water for washing for cooking
[20:40] for cleaning he gets it from
[20:42] the rain
[20:44] and so when he built this house he was
[20:46] able to dig a well there was a place out
[20:48] back that he could dig and he dug down
[20:50] just a little bit and he hit solid rock
[20:53] and they chiseled through the rock and
[20:54] they found a cavern between two layers
[20:56] of rock that has gushing water clean
[20:59] gushing water so he doesn't have to rely
[21:01] on the rainfall only anymore so he's got
[21:04] a place where he can
[21:06] really
[21:07] keep guests where he can really tend to
[21:10] the church where he can really take care
[21:11] of all the things that he needs to take
[21:12] care of and i was really so happy for
[21:15] him and so happy for that brother that
[21:18] that had a vision and wanted him to have
[21:20] a place that he could use for the glory
[21:22] of god so it was wonderful we really
[21:25] appreciated being there
[21:28] this next picture is out back this is
[21:30] brother abraham's barn with a yard full
[21:32] of chickens and turkeys and cows
[21:35] and when you eat it brother abraham's
[21:37] because he's really a farmer he lives
[21:38] out in the village he's you know 30
[21:40] minutes from the city and he's really a
[21:42] farmer
[21:43] and when you sit down to a meal
[21:46] brother abraham bought almost nothing on
[21:48] that table everything came from his farm
[21:51] you have mangoes you have papayas you
[21:53] have pineapples you have chicken you
[21:55] have beef you have all kinds of i mean
[21:58] you eat good
[22:00] you get corn meal and what i call
[22:02] cornmeal they've got another name for it
[22:05] but
[22:07] what we call organic
[22:10] is all that he eats amen and so we get
[22:13] organic meals every day and and so
[22:16] uh
[22:17] i was outside one day in the morning
[22:20] just reading my bible i think it was on
[22:22] a tuesday there and just studying and
[22:24] just sitting outside and i saw some of
[22:26] the younger girls that were helping
[22:28] sister rachel there they were running
[22:30] around with a stick chasing a chicken
[22:31] around the yard trying to catch a
[22:32] chicken i said oh i wonder if we're
[22:34] having chicken for lunch
[22:36] and sure enough we had chicken for lunch
[22:38] so so it was fresh chicken
[22:42] and it's the real he called brother
[22:44] abraham calls it original chicken not
[22:46] like what he said not like what you be
[22:48] you people eat this one you have to have
[22:50] a good set of teeth to eat this chicken
[22:52] you really have to tear it apart and
[22:54] then you know then it sticks between
[22:56] your teeth and you have to have a
[22:57] toothpick or else you wake up in the
[22:58] night with a toothache because you got a
[23:00] piece of meat lodged up in there but
[23:02] it's it's the original
[23:04] so we had good food the entire time and
[23:07] so it was just really nice to be there
[23:09] but abraham's home
[23:10] another thing that i thoroughly
[23:12] thoroughly enjoyed is brother abraham's
[23:14] family altar every night and every
[23:16] morning and he never misses it
[23:19] and so
[23:20] family altar would be whenever the the
[23:22] rest of the guests would leave because
[23:23] he had people in for special meetings
[23:26] whenever the rest of the guests would
[23:27] leave
[23:28] you know whoever was staying in his
[23:29] house that night we would gather for
[23:31] family altar and brother abraham would
[23:33] play the guitar and he said he taught
[23:35] himself how to play the guitar he'd play
[23:37] the guitar and sing
[23:38] and then
[23:39] he would open up the bible and read
[23:41] through a portion of scripture if we
[23:42] were reading through matthew at the time
[23:45] and then he would expound on it and i
[23:47] enjoyed him expounding on the word so
[23:49] much and then he would sing another song
[23:51] and we would go to prayer and after we
[23:53] all prayed the whole family after we
[23:55] prayed we'd go to bed and many times we
[23:57] were having family altar because it was
[23:58] a really busy time for them with having
[24:00] the wedding we'd be having family altar
[24:02] at 11 11 30 12 o'clock
[24:05] and wouldn't you know it 5 a.m every
[24:08] single morning we have another family
[24:09] altar
[24:10] and the the first morning or two i could
[24:13] hear him out there singing i'm like oh
[24:14] lord
[24:16] i have to get up
[24:18] i can't just lay here amen so
[24:21] every morning at 5am no matter when you
[24:24] went to bed if you went to bed at 1am
[24:26] 5am you get up for family altar and the
[24:28] same thing you start seeing you'd hear
[24:30] him and his wife and they're singing and
[24:32] that was the wake-up call we'd come to
[24:34] family altar and the same thing expound
[24:35] on the sing expound on the scriptures
[24:38] have prayer and then i would sneak back
[24:40] to bed for an hour or two
[24:42] praise god
[24:44] luckily the breakfast comes late like at
[24:46] 10.
[24:47] but i was really blessed by that and
[24:49] really encouraged by that and inspired
[24:52] by that to be more diligent even in our
[24:54] own family altar you know because it was
[24:56] really a wonderful time of worship it
[24:58] wasn't just reading through a scripture
[25:00] but it was worship the family worshiped
[25:02] together not just prayed together and i
[25:04] that was a benefit to me and i really
[25:06] enjoyed it
[25:07] so
[25:09] there was another brother that was there
[25:10] for the same duration of the trip with
[25:12] me sorry
[25:14] this this uh the tall brother there the
[25:17] white brother there is brother de vet
[25:19] engelbracht
[25:21] i practice saying that a lot
[25:23] ingobracht
[25:25] but he's from south africa so his name
[25:28] is comes from the
[25:30] dutch blend of whatever is blended in
[25:32] south africa but this brother sent me a
[25:35] watch that message a few days before i
[25:36] left and he let me know that we would be
[25:39] he would be traveling to uganda and be
[25:41] there with me at the same time
[25:43] brother um
[25:46] alright robertson was going to come my
[25:48] brother already couldn't make it so he
[25:49] asked this brother to go instead and so
[25:51] this brother is a young pastor he's 32
[25:54] years old i believe either 32 or 34 and
[25:56] he pastors a group there just outside
[25:59] johannesburg
[26:02] the brother's like six foot seven
[26:04] six foot eight he's a big brother
[26:07] and uh
[26:08] when i met him we got the dog
[26:10] excuse me we got the talking
[26:12] and i thought he looked familiar there
[26:14] was something really familiar about him
[26:17] so when i we started talking he says
[26:19] yeah he says when you remember when you
[26:21] came
[26:22] to the camp for brother gideon and
[26:24] brother willie ratif
[26:25] and that would have been excuse me
[26:27] easter time 2018. i went to do easter
[26:30] meetings for their camp
[26:32] and i took uh the whole weekend of
[26:34] services there
[26:36] and he says
[26:37] i was the song leader
[26:39] so i knew this brother i met this
[26:42] brother
[26:42] uh
[26:43] almost three years ago and i didn't know
[26:46] his name i don't think we were formally
[26:47] introduced but he was the one leading
[26:49] songs every time i came to the pulpit
[26:52] and so now when i meet him two years
[26:54] later i thought wow god this is a small
[26:57] world amen so i didn't even know who it
[26:59] was that i was meeting but
[27:01] he was part of brother william brother
[27:03] gideon's church for a long time a song
[27:05] leave there for a long time and then
[27:06] they moved a little bit out of
[27:08] johannesburg and they started to work
[27:09] there and now
[27:12] excuse me now they're gathering like 60
[27:13] 70 people in a church and he's been
[27:16] pastoring there now for two years so it
[27:18] was really wonderful to get to know this
[27:20] brother from south africa and he we had
[27:22] a really good time of fellowship and it
[27:24] was really beneficial and i can say this
[27:26] trip for me was was really fruitful in
[27:28] many ways
[27:30] i could see the hand of god i felt like
[27:32] i was supposed to go but and really the
[27:34] main reason that i went because brother
[27:36] abraham really asked me to come and do
[27:38] the wedding for his oldest daughter and
[27:40] it was something that
[27:42] sister mercy had shared with my wife
[27:45] that that wasn't something to take
[27:47] lightly because brother abraham's very
[27:49] very serious
[27:50] on who prays a blessing over a wedding
[27:52] that he wouldn't ask anybody that it's
[27:55] it's it's an honor but it's something
[27:56] he's very serious about so i really felt
[27:59] to do it for him he's been a good friend
[28:01] to me and he's been a good brother here
[28:03] for the assembly and a friend of many of
[28:04] us so i traveled to do that but i can
[28:07] say it was fruitful on many many avenues
[28:10] and it was fruitful also for this
[28:11] brother david because we had some deep
[28:14] discussions on the messages and things
[28:16] that that god was we had some time
[28:18] together and as we begin to fellowship
[28:20] some things were really opening up and
[28:22] blowing up and and he he told me one
[28:24] time we were talking he said brother you
[28:26] have to quit he goes i'm going to
[28:27] explode he goes i can't take no more
[28:30] he said i'm going to go home and he goes
[28:31] i'm going to preach i don't know he said
[28:33] i don't know how many sermons he said he
[28:34] was going to preach and i could tell
[28:36] just that time together i enjoyed the
[28:37] fellowship with him but things were
[28:39] really opening up and god was really
[28:41] doing a work and it was it was really
[28:43] wonderful because he had some questions
[28:45] and he would ask some questions and we
[28:46] would just go into the message and you
[28:48] could see i just love to see
[28:50] the light bulb go off for somebody and
[28:53] you can see it's almost like fireworks
[28:55] were coming out of his head amen and he
[28:57] would just i mean he would he goes i'm
[28:59] about to run around and shout brother he
[29:01] said this is so exciting and it was it
[29:04] was so it was so rewarding for me so i
[29:06] enjoyed that kind of fellowship and we
[29:08] had a wonder wonderful time so i would
[29:11] love to get his tapes when he gets back
[29:12] home and and listen to him preach i
[29:14] would enjoy that i might ask him if
[29:16] they'd do any kind of streaming or
[29:17] archive if i could slip in and take a
[29:19] peek because we had a wonderful time of
[29:21] fellowship he took a couple of the
[29:24] services while we were there he was
[29:25] there the whole time i was there he flew
[29:27] in the day i flew in and he flew out the
[29:29] day i flew out
[29:31] this is brother abraham's church
[29:33] you can see the church in the distance
[29:36] and then the foreground is some tents
[29:39] brother abraham's congregation hasn't
[29:41] fit into their church for many years and
[29:43] so they've had to meet outside it to the
[29:45] left you'll see a mango tree there's a
[29:47] lot of people under there actually a lot
[29:49] of women and young children are sitting
[29:51] in the mango tree and there's people
[29:53] there's other shade trees around there's
[29:54] people there and there's people under
[29:55] the tents
[29:56] but
[29:58] this is the mango tree
[30:00] that brother abraham
[30:02] tried to eat from when he was a boy he
[30:04] was rejected from his family and chased
[30:06] away
[30:07] and when he would come to try to get
[30:08] mangoes from this tree they would throw
[30:10] stones at him and chase him away
[30:12] and
[30:13] later we were sitting under it last time
[30:15] we were here six years ago and a mango
[30:17] fell
[30:18] and he goes
[30:19] just think he goes they used to throw
[30:21] stones at me and chase me away from this
[30:23] tree and now god's given me the tree
[30:26] he said now it's my tree
[30:28] and he said this is a blessed mango tree
[30:30] because mangoes usually ripen in a
[30:32] certain season
[30:33] he said this tree is not like any other
[30:35] mango tree he said if you look there's
[30:37] some flowers there's some fruits there's
[30:39] some ripening and some falling he said
[30:41] it produces mangoes year round all the
[30:43] time he said it's not like any other
[30:45] mango tree so this is a blessed mango
[30:48] tree and so many of the congregations
[30:49] sit under that mango tree yet because
[30:52] they're required to do some form of
[30:53] social distancing
[30:55] and so when they could gather back to
[30:57] church they had asked us if we could
[30:59] help them with some tents so that they
[31:00] could have the believers so we were able
[31:03] to send some funds to help them buy
[31:04] these tents so they could social
[31:06] distance and still have the believers
[31:08] they needed some of the tents anyhow
[31:10] because they outgrew the
[31:12] the building but you can see
[31:15] the tents go to the right and down the
[31:18] right hand side and this is a picture
[31:20] from the right hand side looking back
[31:23] and you can see some church excuse me
[31:25] chairs even under this little overhang
[31:27] and then people all the way down the
[31:29] tents and all the way around
[31:31] so they packed that place out and they
[31:34] don't even have the tents aren't
[31:35] sufficient the building's not sufficient
[31:37] they're under the mango tree and all the
[31:38] other shade trees
[31:40] so
[31:41] i was able to take some funds to abraham
[31:43] to help them start on a church building
[31:45] we're going to try to help them
[31:47] expand their church building they want
[31:48] to make it wider and a little bit longer
[31:51] and they want to be able to get
[31:52] everybody they're hoping to be able to
[31:53] get everybody into the church and so
[31:55] they're going to start that project
[31:57] hopefully this this coming year
[32:00] so this is inside the church with
[32:02] brother abraham at the pulpit
[32:05] and this is
[32:06] me this is when we we got there we we
[32:10] arrived
[32:11] i think
[32:12] 11
[32:13] 10 30 or 11 p.m friday night we stayed
[32:16] in the hotel right there in entebbe and
[32:19] the next day we drove and it was an
[32:21] all-day drive to get to his house from
[32:23] entebbe like i said that's a rough hot
[32:26] dirty drive it's just not easy and so we
[32:29] made it all day and so we went right
[32:31] into meetings on sunday so we had two
[32:33] services sunday two services on
[32:34] wednesday and i took three of the
[32:36] services brother moses actually took
[32:38] this picture for me he sent it to me
[32:40] brother moses was out in the
[32:41] congregation there and he snapped that
[32:43] picture
[32:44] and this isn't brother david
[32:47] he took one of the services he took the
[32:49] sunday evening service for us
[32:51] one of the highlights of the trip was
[32:53] seeing moses and mercy and their
[32:54] children there there this is in brother
[32:58] abraham's house they stopped my
[33:00] excuse me for a visit
[33:03] and they were so happy to be home they
[33:06] hadn't been home i think sister mercy
[33:07] hadn't been home in five years they
[33:09] meant to see their family when she left
[33:12] all she left to go
[33:14] um
[33:15] to come over to be with moses when she
[33:17] left she had a little baby she had
[33:18] jeremy when she went back she had four
[33:21] babies
[33:22] so that was quite a visit i said sister
[33:23] next time you come back you may have
[33:25] eight
[33:26] she just smiled yeah i don't know what
[33:28] she thought about that but i don't know
[33:30] how they'd get ate across the plane
[33:33] so they had quite an ordeal getting in
[33:35] because you have to have everybody you
[33:37] know has to be tested before they leave
[33:39] then
[33:40] you have to excuse me you have to go
[33:42] through a covet test
[33:44] before within 72 hours of leaving you
[33:45] have to have a negative covet test to
[33:47] fly over there when you land at the
[33:49] airport they test you again
[33:51] and so
[33:53] then it's it's it's hectic everything is
[33:55] hectic in uganda it's organized chaos so
[33:58] they give these resemblance of being
[34:00] organized but then once you get past the
[34:02] placards and signs it's just chaos every
[34:04] man for himself find a line get in get a
[34:07] test and hopefully they got your name on
[34:09] your test bottle and who knows what
[34:10] happens
[34:11] but so we we went through that so they
[34:13] had to go through all of that it was
[34:14] quite a challenge but they made it
[34:16] through
[34:17] and so
[34:18] they're going to be there for a month
[34:19] though i think they come back i think
[34:21] either the 7th or 8th of january so just
[34:23] pray for them they're having a really
[34:25] good time and it was good to see them
[34:27] there and see them happy and see their
[34:28] children playing with all their cousins
[34:30] and all the relatives so we that was one
[34:32] of the highlights of the trip for me to
[34:34] see them over there
[34:36] and you know i i've i've had three
[34:39] negative results on covet tests in the
[34:41] last two weeks i do not have coven
[34:45] that's one thing i'm sure of
[34:47] and each time i mean they violate your
[34:49] sinus cavity so bad they shove that
[34:51] thing so far back in your nose and some
[34:54] of them are a little nicer than others
[34:55] but some of them just get the job done
[34:56] you know they slam it back there and
[34:58] they pull it out
[35:00] the last test i did was in in tebay in
[35:03] uganda and you go into a clinic they
[35:06] call it a clinic i
[35:08] i thank god i didn't need any medical
[35:10] treatment well i was there
[35:13] going to the clinic to get the test so
[35:15] i'm sitting in one plastic chair and
[35:18] brother david's and the other one he's
[35:19] to get tested too and she comes through
[35:21] and she wants to do one in each nostril
[35:23] i don't know why in america we can just
[35:24] do one but they got to do two so this
[35:27] stuff went in and she shoved it so far
[35:29] back i coughed
[35:30] then she did the other one
[35:32] and i looked at brother david i said i
[35:35] can't believe it she hit my tonsils i
[35:36] didn't know you could hit tonsils from
[35:38] your nose
[35:40] so we were
[35:42] yeah
[35:43] i don't want to take any more covet
[35:45] tests
[35:46] i hope we can get past beyond that but i
[35:48] thank god the lord took care of it every
[35:50] time was a negative result i could
[35:52] travel everything worked out just
[35:54] perfect you know one positive test would
[35:56] have been
[35:57] so complicated so complex
[36:00] and but god worked it all out and i
[36:02] really thank him for that so
[36:04] i've been well tested i i have failed
[36:07] every kova test i've ever taken
[36:10] praise god i've never been so happy
[36:12] about failing tests
[36:14] so i got a negative result i think
[36:15] that's either four or five i've taken
[36:16] now
[36:18] so we had services on wednesday so we
[36:21] had services sunday and monday we had
[36:23] special meetings and invited some of the
[36:25] other area churches there was a couple
[36:26] visiting ministers from the area that
[36:28] were there
[36:29] services monday and two are i'm sorry
[36:32] sunday and monday tuesday we had off
[36:34] wednesday we had service
[36:35] and then thursday
[36:37] i got to spend the whole day with
[36:38] brother moses
[36:40] and sister mercy
[36:42] it was really nice because brother moses
[36:44] drove me around to see where he went to
[36:46] school he showed me where the first
[36:48] group was meeting in a school where he
[36:50] first come in contact with the message
[36:52] brother moses is the only believer in
[36:54] his family he was the first one to come
[36:56] in contact some other members of his
[36:58] family been baptized but they're not
[36:59] they walked away right now so he's the
[37:01] only believer in his family but he
[37:03] showed me the little school room where
[37:05] they met where he first come in contact
[37:07] with the truth showed me a little school
[37:08] where he went to primary school and
[37:10] showed me the road he walked to go to
[37:12] school it's quite a walk
[37:15] and so i really enjoyed you know he's
[37:18] part of us he's part of the family here
[37:20] but it was really good to go see
[37:22] where he grew up see his family where
[37:24] they're from so i really enjoyed that so
[37:27] brother moses took us out for a drive
[37:29] and so this is a little clip of what
[37:31] it's like driving down the road this is
[37:33] the secondary roads in a town a city
[37:36] called embale which this general area is
[37:39] the area where brother moses who grew up
[37:44] so i'm in the front seat
[37:48] i'm on the left side but i'm not driving
[37:49] they drive on the right side there so
[37:51] i'm shooting video
[37:54] but this gives you a feel what most of
[37:56] the roads are like
[38:00] and if you watch the dash bouncing up
[38:02] and down
[38:04] that's how you drive you bounce all over
[38:06] the place
[38:07] so those are what the majority of the
[38:09] roads are like they do have some asphalt
[38:11] roads between the cities and in a couple
[38:13] main thoroughfares in the cities and
[38:15] this is what it's like to be on one of
[38:17] those
[38:23] if you're a nervous passenger you just
[38:24] have to close your eyes
[38:27] and you just pray
[38:29] the first few times i was overseas
[38:31] that's all i would do i'd close my eyes
[38:32] and pray i wouldn't even watch them
[38:34] drive
[38:35] because i'm the kind of person who likes
[38:36] to have a little bit of control and when
[38:37] you're sitting over there you have no
[38:39] control
[38:40] and
[38:41] i mean there's people everywhere there's
[38:43] kids running across the road there's
[38:44] people motorcycles and bicycles and and
[38:47] vegetable stands and and trucks and
[38:50] parked cars and there's no lines there's
[38:52] chaos everything everywhere i used to
[38:54] just close my eyes and pray and now i
[38:56] just keep my eyes open and pray
[38:57] i'm advancing in my faith amen
[39:00] i'm doing better but but it's just
[39:02] normal it's so normal and what was
[39:04] interesting is brother moses is learning
[39:06] how to drive on the right-hand side of
[39:08] the car on the left-hand side of the
[39:10] road he learned to drive in america he
[39:12] didn't learn to drive there so when he
[39:13] went back he's learning to drive on the
[39:16] left-hand side
[39:17] on the right side of the car
[39:19] for the first time
[39:22] he says you know i'm learning to drive
[39:23] down i said oh praise god thank
[39:25] you
[39:27] praise the lord
[39:28] what a good place to learn i mean
[39:30] so i mean it's not like you can do
[39:31] anything wrong there's no traffic law so
[39:33] it's not like you can violate a traffic
[39:35] law you just drive you know
[39:37] it's funny because they even have
[39:38] traffic police but i do not know what
[39:40] they're there for i have no idea what
[39:42] they do i think they just stand there
[39:43] and every once in a while pull somebody
[39:45] over and talk to them that's what it
[39:46] looked like to me and then let them go
[39:50] so this is a brother moses sister
[39:51] mercy's house in uganda brother moses
[39:53] had sent some funds home to build a
[39:55] house
[39:56] it's not complete he told me it's about
[39:58] 60 percent complete but this is where
[39:59] they're staying when they went back home
[40:01] so
[40:03] this is mostly mercy's home we got to
[40:04] stay there
[40:06] this is moses's garden that you can see
[40:08] the banana trees some corn plants a
[40:10] papaya plant all of this is in his
[40:12] garden so
[40:14] this brother moses has his own his own
[40:18] vegetables and fruit there his own
[40:20] bananas and i asked him who keeps the
[40:21] garden he said his parents his parents
[40:23] live in the house just behind him they
[40:25] keep the garden for him so that was
[40:26] really neat to see that i don't know if
[40:28] you can see you see how blue the sky is
[40:30] in the background
[40:31] it's beautiful
[40:34] this was a real treat for me
[40:36] this was jeremy's sixth birthday so we
[40:39] got to go for jeremy's birthday party
[40:41] jeremy turns six he's got all his
[40:43] relatives there those are all some aunts
[40:45] and some cousins
[40:48] of brother moses family so he turned six
[40:50] we were there for his birthday party and
[40:52] it was interesting because jeremy was
[40:54] born there he's the only one of their
[40:56] four children that was born there he was
[40:57] born there and he went back to celebrate
[41:00] his sixth birthday so we had good time
[41:02] there
[41:03] this is brother moses is dead and so
[41:07] brother moses dan is a he's an anglican
[41:11] so he's been in the anglican church i
[41:13] believe all of his life
[41:15] and he's a very intelligent man he's
[41:16] been a schoolteacher for 40 years he
[41:18] just recently retired he's been teaching
[41:20] school in kenya and he's really really
[41:22] bright
[41:24] and he had some questions about the
[41:25] bible
[41:27] so
[41:28] this this man loves geography he loves
[41:30] to talk about geography around the world
[41:32] and ask questions and you tell him where
[41:34] you're from and he starts telling you
[41:36] rivers that are near you because he
[41:38] studies geography and mountain ranges
[41:40] and asks us all kinds of questions about
[41:41] united states
[41:43] but moses prompted him a little bit he
[41:45] said remember that you had a question
[41:46] about water baptism
[41:48] and so he asked us the question and we
[41:50] sat and witnessed this man for i mean i
[41:52] don't know how long we were talking to
[41:54] him talking about the creation of the
[41:56] world and talking about uh water baptism
[41:59] in jesus name and all kinds of stuff so
[42:01] that was a real treat and it was a real
[42:02] blessing and i could tell moses was
[42:04] excited because moses was wanting to get
[42:06] more truth to his dad and so we were
[42:08] there we were able to talk about
[42:09] water baptism we talked about the
[42:11] rapture we talked about some things in
[42:12] revelation talked about creation we just
[42:15] i bet we spent an hour or more maybe two
[42:18] hours just sitting talking and
[42:20] witnessing and so we just pray that god
[42:22] will bring some fruit from that so this
[42:24] is brother moses living room over there
[42:27] then we got to see sister mercy's mom
[42:29] this is sister mercy's mom's house so
[42:32] this is where her mother lives
[42:34] and we got to visit with her this is
[42:36] inside of her house and you can see it's
[42:38] just a teeny tiny little house this is
[42:41] the living room which would make up
[42:42] probably one third
[42:45] one third to half of the house
[42:47] and so
[42:48] we're in there visiting
[42:50] and this is sister mercy and her mom
[42:53] so it was really nice to get to see her
[42:55] mom to meet her and
[42:57] and so i was giving them good reports of
[42:59] how we all love sister mercy and we love
[43:01] brother moses and their parents were so
[43:03] happy that they're doing well here that
[43:04] they have friends and that people love
[43:06] them and that they're really part of a
[43:08] body and so it was really a blessing it
[43:10] was a blessing for me to get to meet
[43:12] them and carry a good report back to
[43:14] their parents and their parents were
[43:15] really blessed by that so it was like i
[43:17] said there was many different things
[43:18] that took place on this trip that i
[43:20] wasn't expecting and it was kind of out
[43:21] of the normal for me for a trip to go
[43:23] minister but it was really good
[43:27] this
[43:28] uh
[43:29] is again of course me and brother david
[43:31] but to the left-hand side of me is a
[43:34] brother named brother evans this is
[43:36] brother evans i'm going to see if i can
[43:38] get his name here and pronounce it
[43:40] correctly
[43:42] brother evans
[43:47] evans osumba
[43:49] evan zasumba all the way to the right is
[43:51] his wife
[43:53] evelyn and the sister next to her is
[43:55] catherine one of the sisters from the
[43:56] church
[43:58] they came down from kenya
[44:00] to be part of the meetings they came in
[44:03] as special guests for abraham for the
[44:04] wedding and for the services after
[44:07] and uh
[44:08] brother evans and i got a chance to talk
[44:10] and visit and and he began to share with
[44:13] us that he's been streaming our services
[44:15] for quite a while
[44:16] and in kenya they really went through an
[44:18] ordeal of people falling away from the
[44:20] message and really starting
[44:22] to
[44:23] really blaspheme and really speak evil
[44:25] the prophet and created quite a bit of
[44:27] confusion
[44:28] and he said while that was going on he
[44:30] said god led them to our services and he
[44:33] began to watch some things that he said
[44:35] really gave him a breakthrough like it
[44:37] totally he said it changed everything
[44:39] for me it gave me the strength to stand
[44:41] and and he was really thanking us for
[44:43] our services he wanted to send greetings
[44:45] to you guys as well he said greet the
[44:47] church for me tell him thank you for
[44:48] standing true he said it's been so
[44:50] exciting to see a group of people stand
[44:52] for the message and he wanted to send
[44:54] special greetings to all of you
[44:56] and so the brother was
[44:58] he he watches a lot of our services like
[45:00] he was telling me all kinds of stuff
[45:02] that we preached he preached as he
[45:03] preached this he preached this i said
[45:04] well there's no point for you to come to
[45:05] church on sunday because you know
[45:07] everything i can possibly preach
[45:09] and so but you know they they're tuned
[45:12] in and he's a minister also they've got
[45:14] a group
[45:15] there
[45:16] in kenya they have a church and a pastor
[45:18] and they're well established they're
[45:20] doing really well the group is standing
[45:21] strong and they're doing really well but
[45:23] it was
[45:24] excuse me it was a few years ago they
[45:26] went through that shaking and he said
[45:27] the word of god just grew and magnified
[45:30] in them and then they're they're able to
[45:31] really stand and and he was just really
[45:34] uh blessed but through watching the
[45:36] services here he saw brother abraham
[45:38] minister then he found abraham's
[45:40] testimony so they live he's about an
[45:43] eight hour drive eight to nine hour
[45:45] drive away in kenya so he drove
[45:47] um several months ago i think earlier in
[45:49] the year drove down to be part of a
[45:52] services there to meet brother abraham
[45:54] and they got acquainted they became
[45:55] friends and so when he knew that we were
[45:58] coming he came back down so now he and
[46:01] brother abraham are
[46:03] acquainted they've invited brother
[46:04] abraham up to kenya and it looks like he
[46:06] may be able to go up there and minister
[46:08] sometime
[46:09] so it was really neat just sometimes you
[46:12] just don't know what's going on on the
[46:14] other end you don't know i mean we know
[46:16] how god's blessing us we know how
[46:18] wonderful the word is for us and how
[46:19] we've grown and how god has established
[46:22] us in the truth and keeps establishing
[46:24] us in the truth but you really don't
[46:25] know that that's having an effect on
[46:27] somebody else as well you don't know
[46:28] that just standing for the truth gives
[46:30] somebody else courage to stand for the
[46:32] truth and so i just i just want to share
[46:34] that appreciation with you because the
[46:36] brother was really thankful that there
[46:37] was a group of people in america
[46:38] standing for the truth and it really
[46:40] blessed him and gave him the courage to
[46:42] stand so for me it was a real treat just
[46:45] to hear his testimony to hear the things
[46:46] that he said the things that blessed him
[46:49] it was a real real deep encouragement
[46:51] for me
[46:52] and so it's it's easy the devil's a
[46:54] really good discourager he's even easy
[46:56] to get discouraged but when you go and
[46:58] you meet a brother that you didn't know
[46:59] existed you know you had no idea who he
[47:02] was and where he was on earth and you
[47:04] didn't know anything about him and you
[47:05] sit across
[47:06] the living room from him and you just
[47:07] fell a ship and you find out he's in
[47:09] love with the same word you're in love
[47:10] with and he's growing just like you're
[47:12] growing and he's been benefited by
[47:14] anything that you were able to do and it
[47:16] just it's a great encouragement and god
[47:18] really blessed us that way and made it
[47:20] nice for us so that was a real special
[47:22] treat for me and we got to spend several
[47:24] days with this group from kenya and so
[47:26] it was it was quite a blessing
[47:29] the main event then started coming on
[47:32] friday thursday i spent the day with
[47:34] brother moses sister mercy
[47:36] friday is what they call introduction so
[47:39] i was introduced to all kinds of new
[47:41] things that i'd never seen or heard
[47:42] before and one thing i realized is
[47:45] weddings were a big deal everywhere on
[47:46] the planet
[47:48] i thought i thought
[47:50] i thought we were over the top on
[47:52] weddings
[47:54] boy was i wrong i'll never complain
[47:57] about our weddings anymore the armed
[47:59] weddings are great amen
[48:02] i've had the feeling you know we should
[48:03] simplify our wedding make it simple just
[48:06] get married after church i mean what's
[48:07] the big deal
[48:09] but when i traveled over there
[48:12] boy it's different
[48:14] the real big event to the wedding is the
[48:16] introduction the introduction took place
[48:18] at brother
[48:19] abraham's house
[48:21] these are the tents this is the brother
[48:22] abraham's front yard they bought with
[48:24] the tents from the church and strung
[48:25] them out for the guests
[48:28] and the introduction is interesting
[48:30] because
[48:31] you don't marry somebody in your own
[48:34] clan your clan would be like your family
[48:35] group so a tribe can be broke up into
[48:38] clans different extended family groups
[48:42] and you don't marry somebody from your
[48:43] clan you marry from another clan in your
[48:45] tribe or you can marry from another clan
[48:46] and another tribe and
[48:49] this happened to be a brother from
[48:51] another
[48:52] tribe and another clan
[48:54] but because you're from separate clans
[48:56] what they do is they have what they call
[48:57] introduction so when the boy and the
[48:59] girl decide that they're going to get
[49:01] married they talk to the parents they
[49:02] make all the arrangements then the
[49:04] parents of
[49:06] the bride
[49:07] will invite the family part of the clan
[49:10] or representing party from the clan of
[49:13] the groom over to meet pretty much the
[49:16] whole clan there was like 400 people at
[49:18] brother abraham's in his front yard
[49:20] so
[49:21] so they come and they meet the clan and
[49:23] this is a big deal this is actually
[49:25] bigger than the wedding itself
[49:27] because what they're doing is this i'm
[49:30] sharing this with you because i found it
[49:31] absolutely fascinating i was sitting
[49:33] there the whole time like this is
[49:34] amazing
[49:36] they're coming
[49:37] to take her and take her back to be part
[49:39] of their clan
[49:41] so the whole meeting is they're actually
[49:43] coming to fetch a bride they're coming
[49:45] with the groom they're represented as a
[49:47] family and they're coming to take her
[49:48] from this clan to their clan so the
[49:51] whole thing's deeply rooted in tradition
[49:53] that goes way back i mean way back
[49:55] before cell phones before uh any of that
[49:57] stuff and that's where this gets started
[49:59] and so what they do is they this
[50:01] representing party i think there was
[50:02] about 40 or 50 of them came and so we're
[50:05] sitting there waiting
[50:07] and as we're sitting there waiting
[50:09] um
[50:10] you know one thing i realize is nothing
[50:14] happens on time
[50:16] brother moses looked over at me one time
[50:17] i said i thought this started at 10 it
[50:19] was like 2 o'clock
[50:21] no 11 i think it was like 1 30 or 2. he
[50:24] goes
[50:25] he goes yeah you know moses he's quiet
[50:27] he goes
[50:28] time keeping is a bit of a problem for
[50:30] us
[50:34] i said yeah you don't say
[50:36] oh my goodness i said when we got to the
[50:40] next day to the wedding the wedding
[50:42] started four hours late
[50:46] and i was the one conducting the wedding
[50:48] i was preaching the wedding i was doing
[50:49] the vows i was doing the whole wedding
[50:51] and so for me i mean this is like i i
[50:54] work my schedule i like things
[50:56] regimented i like schedules and so i
[50:59] asked the night before what time does
[51:00] this start i asked the bride in the
[51:02] groom they had very specific he says
[51:04] we're going to start at 10 he goes and
[51:05] we'll not we know that some people will
[51:07] be late but 10 30 11 at the latest
[51:10] i said well that sounds like africa okay
[51:12] i can deal with that
[51:13] so i get up in the morning i get all my
[51:15] notes repaired i got the sermon online i
[51:17] get showered i get dressed i got my tie
[51:19] on and i and i come to breakfast i think
[51:22] 9 30 i think nine there we eat we'll go
[51:24] because we got to drive to in bali they
[51:26] had it at a hotel so you go to this
[51:27] hotel and then we just sit there and we
[51:29] just sit there and nobody else is
[51:31] dressed
[51:32] i mean the bride's in the house i mean
[51:34] so i know there's no wedding because
[51:36] it's not like we're missing anything
[51:39] and so i asked them well there's been a
[51:41] delay and then there was another delay
[51:43] and then there was another delay and
[51:44] then another delay
[51:46] and i i'm sitting here just like lord
[51:49] you've got to help me
[51:50] this is
[51:52] god did this to me because i need to be
[51:54] changed a bit i need to be less
[51:56] regimented i need to take things in
[51:58] stride i need to learn to let people be
[52:00] what they are and just smile and be a
[52:02] happy person so
[52:05] here i am
[52:06] dressed for a wedding
[52:09] for five hours
[52:13] i mean i don't mind dress clothes all
[52:14] that bad but no i don't like them that
[52:15] well
[52:17] so yeah it was interesting
[52:21] but back to introduction
[52:23] so
[52:24] this you can see is the bride and the
[52:26] groom
[52:28] brother abraham's second-born child but
[52:30] his oldest daughter her name is rebecca
[52:33] her future husband is brian they're
[52:35] married now so it's her husband brian
[52:37] and if you look at the sign and excuse
[52:39] me in the background it says rebecca
[52:41] introduces brian
[52:43] because her clans never met brian so
[52:45] they're coming and rebecca's going to
[52:47] introduce brian to the whole clan and
[52:49] everything has ceremonies i mean
[52:51] everything is is so interesting
[52:55] i mean this is a i can't stress how big
[52:57] a deal this is so we're sitting there
[52:59] and i mean i'm sitting here this is
[53:01] another one of those all day deals it's
[53:03] supposed to start at something it
[53:04] doesn't start and
[53:08] the key word is delay
[53:12] because now the groom's family was
[53:14] delayed okay so we're sitting there in
[53:16] the delay so they come and they make a
[53:19] little gate they make like a little hoop
[53:22] with some greenery and there's a gate
[53:24] and they come to the gate and they can't
[53:25] come in the gate
[53:27] until
[53:28] uh the bridesmaids have to go inspect
[53:31] and make sure they have an invitation to
[53:32] the right people and all this so there's
[53:34] a big ceremony back and forth and then
[53:36] they come
[53:38] and they say what are you here for and
[53:40] they give a microphone to the man and so
[53:42] the key spokesman for the clan that's
[53:43] coming says i'm here to pick a flower
[53:47] i said oh you want a flower this is no
[53:49] flower garden go home you know and they
[53:51] make it intentionally hard and this is
[53:53] all in good fun it's ingest but what
[53:55] they're trying to do is make the clan
[53:57] work for the girl they can't just come
[53:59] in and get her so they try to drive them
[54:01] away they try to discourage them they
[54:03] tell them we have no flowers go away and
[54:05] they have to be persistent i'm telling
[54:07] you if we had introductions like this i
[54:09] don't know who would get married i
[54:13] it's a lot of work
[54:16] so i was fascinated by the whole thing
[54:18] i'm sitting here thinking i have never
[54:19] seen anything like this in my life but
[54:21] it's also really interesting because
[54:22] it's deeply rooted in tradition and
[54:24] everything has a lot of meaning
[54:26] and so the groom comes and the groom is
[54:28] kind of hidden in the in the company and
[54:31] they go sit in chairs and they have
[54:32] their honor
[54:33] and guest so they have
[54:35] premium seating there as a family and
[54:37] he's kind of hidden in the back and at
[54:39] some point i mean there's all kinds of
[54:40] stuff that goes back and forth questions
[54:43] and they want to pick a flower
[54:44] so they said you want to pick a flower
[54:46] so they give them a flower he said
[54:47] that's not the flower i'm looking for
[54:48] this flower speaks this flower can talk
[54:50] and
[54:51] we were told if we could come we could
[54:52] get this flower and so they said oh so
[54:55] they march out like five girls from the
[54:58] tribe they're all dressed up march them
[54:59] out and they say any of these your
[55:01] flower and they said no this isn't the
[55:02] flower we're looking for and they go and
[55:05] they march in seven more and no and
[55:07] there's this whole ceremony that's not
[55:09] them and and the whole thing is set up
[55:12] to to make them really work for the one
[55:14] that they came for and so finally back
[55:17] and forth and back and forth and it's
[55:19] interesting because i was just cracking
[55:22] up because they really make them work
[55:24] they say okay i need transportation
[55:26] money to get some more so you can see
[55:28] some more flowers so the groom's family
[55:30] has to pay them
[55:31] and he pays them to go get seven more
[55:34] girls
[55:34] [Laughter]
[55:36] and then none of those oh he says well
[55:38] now we're going to have to take an
[55:39] airline it's going to be more money so
[55:41] he has to pay to go get more girls and
[55:43] and finally
[55:45] it all climaxes with rebecca coming out
[55:47] with her bridal party and it's a big
[55:48] hoopla and everybody's cheering and all
[55:50] of these things it was just super
[55:52] interesting i mean this has nothing to
[55:54] do with anything i'm just sharing it
[55:55] with you because i thought it was
[55:56] fascinating
[55:57] so finally rebecca then she'll go at one
[55:59] point and she'll go pull out of the
[56:00] crowd brian and then she brings brian
[56:02] out and introduces this is the formal
[56:04] introduction of brian to her family
[56:07] so i thought it was interesting i i like
[56:10] the traditional part of it but i mean a
[56:13] whole day ceremony like that i'm just
[56:15] glad we get married the way we do i mean
[56:19] keep it simple friends
[56:22] the vowels were the exact same i promise
[56:24] you i use the exact same vowels so the
[56:26] binding wedding is the same
[56:29] so
[56:30] so it was it was fun to see it anyways i
[56:32] got a lesson in ugandan culture
[56:34] and then i had to wear a traditional
[56:38] outfit
[56:42] this was really important to the family
[56:44] so they bought brother devitt and myself
[56:47] this is brother david myself and brother
[56:48] moses they bought us these
[56:51] i was calling them dresses but you
[56:52] probably shouldn't call them dresses
[56:54] they probably should be called i think
[56:55] they're called robes or something or
[56:57] gowns i don't remember what they said
[56:59] but it was very interesting i mean i'm
[57:01] not used to wearing anything like that
[57:03] so i was like i was i have sympathy from
[57:05] my girls you know you gotta gather this
[57:07] up to go up and down steps so you don't
[57:08] step on it and things like that i was
[57:10] learning all kinds of things i've never
[57:12] experienced before in my life
[57:14] so you wear you know you wear this and
[57:16] you wear a suit jacket over it that's
[57:18] the traditional thing and we were
[57:20] honored guests we were part of the
[57:21] household guest so we were part of the
[57:23] receiving party
[57:24] of the household so we were dressed like
[57:26] elder klans members i'm an elder member
[57:29] of the clan
[57:31] so he goes you're an elder in the cla i
[57:33] said yeah i blend right in i mean nobody
[57:34] can tell i'm a visitor
[57:37] i'm a clan elder now so i would like for
[57:40] you guys to call me elder elder lamb
[57:43] because i'm a clan elder
[57:46] so
[57:47] but i sat there and at one point i had
[57:50] my handkerchief in my front pocket and i
[57:51] leaned over to brother david i said is
[57:54] it bad manners to lift your dress to get
[57:56] something out of your pocket or would
[57:57] that be offensive or
[57:59] i'm not sure what i should do like
[58:01] what's protocol so i just snuck my hand
[58:03] up under my seat and got my handkerchief
[58:05] out so
[58:07] i don't know if i'm going to do
[58:08] something wrong or not
[58:10] so basically i just sat still and just
[58:12] watched the proceedings
[58:14] and i was just so glad i didn't have to
[58:15] do anything like i i was so glad i
[58:18] didn't have to
[58:19] take part so here here i am sitting as a
[58:23] member
[58:24] an elder clan member
[58:26] in uganda so praise god i'm an honorary
[58:29] clan member
[58:30] of the new title and
[58:33] if any of you would like to see it they
[58:34] gave me the robe so i have it you know i
[58:36] thought about wearing it tonight but i
[58:38] didn't think my family would go for that
[58:41] so
[58:42] but i'm telling you this was an
[58:44] experience and it was interesting and i
[58:45] was glad to be part of it but it was a
[58:47] long ordeal
[58:49] the time we were done i was exhausted
[58:51] and then we get up the next day and we
[58:52] go for the wedding the wedding is at a
[58:55] um
[58:56] hotel and it's outside under these tents
[58:58] this tent on the left is for the guests
[59:00] and this tent here is where the bride
[59:02] and groom and their best man and their
[59:04] maid of honor will be
[59:06] for the wedding
[59:07] and then there's a picture of moses and
[59:09] mercy and three of their children they
[59:10] were there at the wedding so it was good
[59:11] to spend some time with them again at
[59:13] the wedding
[59:15] this is brother abraham walking his
[59:16] daughter up to the tent
[59:19] and
[59:20] the the wedding ceremony is actually
[59:21] very similar to ours the ceremony itself
[59:24] is not a whole lot different it's it's
[59:26] pretty similar
[59:27] this is me i was doing the service there
[59:30] and we had a nice service i mean it was
[59:32] a nice pool it was it really went nice
[59:34] and i thank god for that
[59:36] and then this is brother abraham and i
[59:38] both of us had to sign the marriage
[59:39] certificate and the bride and groom
[59:41] signed it so this is the signing of the
[59:42] marriage certificate so the wedding went
[59:44] really well it was very nice wedding and
[59:46] uh it was
[59:48] um
[59:49] like i said brother
[59:52] i'm sorry brother brian the groom
[59:55] he's also the only believer in his
[59:57] family none of his members of his family
[59:59] are message believers at all
[1:00:01] so you know i just it was a golden
[1:00:04] opportunity for me to preach i preached
[1:00:05] about 45 minutes or so and i preached on
[1:00:08] god's masterpiece
[1:00:10] and how god developed his masterpiece
[1:00:12] through creation and we went into
[1:00:13] marriage and we went into all kinds of
[1:00:15] stuff
[1:00:16] and when i went to my seat and sat down
[1:00:18] one of his one of brian's aunts tapped
[1:00:20] me on the shoulder she goes that was the
[1:00:22] best preaching i've ever heard i've
[1:00:24] never heard marriage like that before
[1:00:26] and then two members of brian's family
[1:00:29] got in contact with brother abraham and
[1:00:31] said we've never heard the word like
[1:00:33] that we've never heard a message like
[1:00:34] that before and one one man come to
[1:00:37] brother
[1:00:38] abraham and said can i talk to you and
[1:00:40] he stepped aside and he says i've never
[1:00:42] heard anything like that you people have
[1:00:44] something different would you please lay
[1:00:46] your hands on me and pray for me that i
[1:00:47] could have god's blessing and they
[1:00:49] exchanged contact information with two
[1:00:51] different or three three different men
[1:00:53] there
[1:00:54] that wanted to know more so i just thank
[1:00:56] god and just pray that some fruit comes
[1:00:58] from that but it was
[1:01:01] it was really really interesting and
[1:01:03] they were captivated by the word you you
[1:01:06] know that they're not believers so about
[1:01:08] half of the crowd as believers about
[1:01:09] half of the crowd is not believers but
[1:01:11] they were so captivated by the word
[1:01:12] they're all nodding and they're all
[1:01:14] saying amen and you would think it was a
[1:01:16] room full of believers and i was just
[1:01:18] really blessed by that and i thank god
[1:01:19] for it for open hearts so we just pray
[1:01:22] that god will do something permanent
[1:01:24] there
[1:01:26] this is back at brother abraham and then
[1:01:28] on sunday we had a
[1:01:30] one service on sunday these are two
[1:01:32] ladies who bring in their babies to be
[1:01:33] dedicated i just thought that was
[1:01:34] interesting i never seen him do a
[1:01:36] dedication service before that so he was
[1:01:38] praying for the children
[1:01:40] this is the
[1:01:42] service that sunday morning i preached
[1:01:44] the you they're they're still under
[1:01:47] social distancing and mass mandates so
[1:01:49] you come to the pulpit with a mask and
[1:01:50] take it off and the congregation wears a
[1:01:52] mask but this uh translator the one
[1:01:55] who's interpreting for us is brother
[1:01:57] enoch this is brother abraham's oldest
[1:02:00] child his oldest son enoch and enoch was
[1:02:02] a good interpreter and we had a good
[1:02:04] time with enoch and he stuck with us the
[1:02:06] entire time i mean every service we we
[1:02:09] preached he he took the service and this
[1:02:11] last day was a long one but abraham said
[1:02:13] we're only going to have one service he
[1:02:15] says take your time you can preach three
[1:02:17] hours or more and so we did we end up
[1:02:18] preaching three hours
[1:02:20] because with an interpreter it just
[1:02:21] takes a long time and brother enoch was
[1:02:23] young and energetic and he stayed right
[1:02:26] with us it was funny because you know
[1:02:28] i'm preaching like i normally do but
[1:02:30] brother enoch's bouncing up and down
[1:02:32] like a kangaroo one point when he's
[1:02:33] interpreting because he's so excited
[1:02:35] about the word i thought man he's
[1:02:37] getting me all fired up and
[1:02:39] this is really good i mean you want to
[1:02:40] get me fired up and get you to preach
[1:02:42] just come stand next to me and bounce up
[1:02:43] and down like
[1:02:44] and get excited about the word because
[1:02:46] it was it was exciting and it was just a
[1:02:48] really really wonderful atmosphere a
[1:02:50] really wonderful service and god really
[1:02:53] blessed the word and
[1:02:55] i mean it was just tremendous i mean it
[1:02:56] was like
[1:02:58] it was like the atmosphere was swelling
[1:02:59] you know by the end of the service it
[1:03:01] would it would swell to an uproar and
[1:03:03] everybody on their feet it would
[1:03:04] crescendo and come back down and then
[1:03:05] you go to another part of the world and
[1:03:07] it was like ebbing and flowing and it
[1:03:08] was just a wonderful atmosphere and but
[1:03:10] abraham himself said that it was a
[1:03:12] tremendous blessing and i was so
[1:03:14] thankful but i was wiped out at the end
[1:03:17] of that
[1:03:17] and so we had that on sunday monday
[1:03:20] morning we woke up
[1:03:23] excuse me the long hot dusty drive all
[1:03:26] the way back to kampala when i got back
[1:03:28] to kampala i was so tired
[1:03:31] uh
[1:03:31] and i went to into the hotel and i went
[1:03:33] to wash my face they had a hand towel
[1:03:35] there and i washed my face
[1:03:37] and i wiped it off and it was just brown
[1:03:40] streaks all the way down from all the
[1:03:42] dust you pick up from the road and the
[1:03:44] sweat and
[1:03:46] no wonder i'm coughing
[1:03:49] this is the last slide i'm going to show
[1:03:51] this is the brother abraham
[1:03:53] brother abraham
[1:03:55] when he comes up after you preach i told
[1:03:57] him i said the only reason i preach is
[1:03:59] to hear you do the wrap up
[1:04:01] i'll come and preach just to hear you
[1:04:03] wrap up because he calls it the wrap up
[1:04:05] but what it is is another sermon and
[1:04:07] it's my favorite part of the trip to
[1:04:09] hear brother abraham do the wrap up but
[1:04:11] then he'll take the microphone and sing
[1:04:12] and believe abraham always says he goes
[1:04:14] really i'm a better song leader than a
[1:04:15] preacher and you know i don't believe
[1:04:17] that but he's a very good song leader
[1:04:20] and it's just amazing to see the way the
[1:04:22] people respond when he leads the worship
[1:04:24] so here's just a little sample of their
[1:04:25] worship here at the end
[1:04:29] this is a last day sunday
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:38] [Applause]
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:45] foreign
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:05:00] oh
[1:05:13] believe it or not i shuffled my feet a
[1:05:14] little bit
[1:05:18] and i enjoyed it
[1:05:20] it was such a good atmosphere it's
[1:05:22] amazing how people with nothing can
[1:05:24] worship so freely and be so happy
[1:05:27] i mean we would look
[1:05:28] at what they have and it'd be very hard
[1:05:31] for us
[1:05:32] to live a week the way most of the
[1:05:34] believers in that church live very very
[1:05:35] difficult
[1:05:37] but they're happy people the word has
[1:05:40] made them happy they rejoice and they
[1:05:42] sing with their whole heart and i
[1:05:44] enjoyed it it meant a lot to me
[1:05:47] i'd like to wrap up i just want to read
[1:05:48] a couple scriptures as we wind down and
[1:05:51] go to a close if you could take your
[1:05:52] bibles and turn with me to james
[1:05:59] just talk a little bit
[1:06:01] about
[1:06:03] why we do what we do
[1:06:07] james chapter 2
[1:06:13] and verse 14.
[1:06:18] what does it profit my brethren though a
[1:06:20] man say he hath faith and have not works
[1:06:22] can faith save him
[1:06:24] if a brother or sister be naked and
[1:06:25] destitute of daily food and one of you
[1:06:27] say unto them depart in peace be warmed
[1:06:29] and filled notwithstanding you give them
[1:06:32] not those things which are needful to
[1:06:34] the body
[1:06:35] what does it profit
[1:06:37] so
[1:06:40] james is telling us if you see a brother
[1:06:42] in need and you say lord bless you
[1:06:46] and he says but you have means to help
[1:06:47] them and you don't help them what does
[1:06:49] it profit what is the good of saying the
[1:06:51] lord bless you be warmed and be filled
[1:06:53] but if you have an ability to do so
[1:06:55] do good
[1:06:57] i want to look at this in romans i'm
[1:06:59] just going to look at three more
[1:07:00] scriptures let's look at romans chapter
[1:07:02] 15.
[1:07:11] romans chapter 15 and verse 24.
[1:07:22] he says whensoever i take my journey
[1:07:24] into spain i will come to you for i
[1:07:26] trust to see you in my journey and to be
[1:07:28] brought on my way to their word by you
[1:07:30] if first i'd be somewhat filled with
[1:07:32] your company
[1:07:34] but now i go into jerusalem to minister
[1:07:36] unto the saints for it has pleased them
[1:07:38] in macedonia and achaea to make a
[1:07:40] certain contribution for the poor saints
[1:07:42] which are at jerusalem
[1:07:44] it hath pleased them verily that they're
[1:07:46] debtors they are for if the gentiles
[1:07:48] have been made partakers of their
[1:07:49] spiritual things their duty is also to
[1:07:51] minister into them in carnal things
[1:07:54] when therefore i have performed this and
[1:07:56] have sealed to them this fruit i will
[1:07:57] come by you unto spain
[1:08:00] now let's turn to first corinthians 16.
[1:08:05] there's several descriptions we can go
[1:08:06] to but i just want to read enough to get
[1:08:08] a context
[1:08:12] first corinthians 16 and 1.
[1:08:16] first corinthians 16 and 1. now
[1:08:18] concerning the collection for saints
[1:08:20] as i've given order to the children of
[1:08:22] galatia even so do ye upon the first day
[1:08:25] of the week
[1:08:26] excuse me let every one of you lay by
[1:08:28] him in store as god has prospered him
[1:08:30] that there be no gatherings when i come
[1:08:33] and when i come whomsoever you shall
[1:08:34] approve by your letters then will i send
[1:08:36] to bring your liberality unto jerusalem
[1:08:39] and if it be meat that i go also they
[1:08:41] shall go with me
[1:08:43] both in romans and and first corinthians
[1:08:45] here and somewhere else in the
[1:08:47] epistles too
[1:08:48] he's talking about
[1:08:50] they're making a gathering and he he's
[1:08:52] encouraged the churches in macedonia and
[1:08:54] that's all through greece there
[1:08:56] they decided to set money aside for the
[1:08:58] poor saints that are in jerusalem
[1:09:00] and so you can see all the way back in
[1:09:02] the apostle paul's day they were
[1:09:04] gathering money for other brothers that
[1:09:06] had needs
[1:09:07] and the brothers in jerusalem were the
[1:09:09] poor brothers the poor saints that were
[1:09:10] in need so so paul's admonishing them
[1:09:13] and encouraging them save up and he's
[1:09:15] even telling them how to lay it aside so
[1:09:17] they don't gather up when he gets there
[1:09:18] and there'll be one appointed to carry
[1:09:20] it out carry it through and and paul
[1:09:22] said even he could take it himself when
[1:09:24] he talked to the romans
[1:09:25] so
[1:09:27] you can see that this kind of missionary
[1:09:29] work and also relieving the needs of
[1:09:31] others has been going on since the bible
[1:09:33] time has been going on since the time of
[1:09:34] paul
[1:09:35] and let's read one more in galatians if
[1:09:37] we could
[1:09:39] galatians chapter 6.
[1:09:47] galatians chapter 6 verse 9
[1:09:52] and let us not be weary in will doing
[1:09:54] for in due season we shall reap if we
[1:09:56] faint not
[1:09:57] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[1:09:59] do good unto all men especially unto
[1:10:01] them who are of the household of faith
[1:10:04] so the apostle paul is encouraging us
[1:10:08] to reap to sow and we'll reap don't grow
[1:10:11] weary and well doing but when you have
[1:10:13] opportunity to let us do good unto all
[1:10:15] men especially them that are of the
[1:10:17] household of faith
[1:10:18] and i say we've had a blessed
[1:10:19] opportunity to do something for our
[1:10:21] brothers abroad
[1:10:22] it's been a real blessing to be able to
[1:10:24] help some brothers we've helped with all
[1:10:27] kinds of different needs over the years
[1:10:29] you know brother lonnie was a real
[1:10:31] missionary and he really kind of got
[1:10:33] this church set with a missionary
[1:10:36] mindset and i'm thankful for that
[1:10:37] because it's good sometimes to look
[1:10:39] outside our own walls and to recognize
[1:10:41] what's going on elsewhere in the world
[1:10:43] and get a feeling for brothers in other
[1:10:45] parts of the world and for the work that
[1:10:47] they're doing and if there's something
[1:10:48] we can do to help them if it's a
[1:10:49] motorcycle
[1:10:50] if it's the help of the building if it's
[1:10:52] to help print books if it's to help pay
[1:10:54] for a plane ticket for them to go
[1:10:56] minister if there's something that we
[1:10:57] can do and it's and it's in our power to
[1:11:00] do it i say it's a blessing for us to be
[1:11:02] able to do that
[1:11:03] because that's been happening since the
[1:11:05] time of the apostle paul he even speaks
[1:11:07] in the epistles where a brother and a
[1:11:10] group in macedonia sent by a brother of
[1:11:12] funds to help paul out and paul the
[1:11:14] apostle paul says they came to support
[1:11:16] me for your lack you didn't give me but
[1:11:19] they came from far away to support me so
[1:11:21] even even
[1:11:23] the apostle paul is getting support from
[1:11:25] other churches not the church he's at
[1:11:27] but other churches are supporting his
[1:11:28] missionary works
[1:11:30] so and then the traveling around and
[1:11:33] ministering to the brothers if you read
[1:11:34] the epistles paul's always sending this
[1:11:36] brother go to that church and once you
[1:11:37] go there come by here and i'll send this
[1:11:39] brother there you take a letter to this
[1:11:41] brother and you guys receive this
[1:11:42] brother and and paul is sending brothers
[1:11:45] out to encourage the churches and send
[1:11:47] this one here and you take my greetings
[1:11:49] and you come to me and when you come to
[1:11:51] me bring this and bring this brother and
[1:11:53] leave that brother there and have you
[1:11:55] read the have you read the epistles and
[1:11:56] read the book of acts
[1:11:58] so this going to encourage our brothers
[1:12:00] in other cities has been going on since
[1:12:02] the time of paul missionary work has
[1:12:03] been going on since the time of paul
[1:12:05] supporting the needs of other brothers
[1:12:07] have been going on since the time of
[1:12:08] paul supporting the minister who's going
[1:12:10] out has been going since the time of
[1:12:12] paul so really when we do these kind of
[1:12:14] works we're just supporting a
[1:12:16] long-standing christian tradition that
[1:12:18] started in the ministry of the apostle
[1:12:19] paul in the first century christians and
[1:12:22] i say it's a privilege it's a privilege
[1:12:24] to be able to do something and see god
[1:12:26] bless it and see the people and then to
[1:12:28] be able to follow up and go and see the
[1:12:30] work
[1:12:31] let's see
[1:12:32] the people are happy the work's
[1:12:34] establishing the work's growing brother
[1:12:36] abraham does a radio ministry
[1:12:39] once a week every week he preaches for
[1:12:40] two hours he preaches one hour in
[1:12:43] english and one hour in his native
[1:12:45] tribal language
[1:12:46] and he sees many results from that
[1:12:49] people are coming to the church people
[1:12:50] are going to other churches in the area
[1:12:52] he's always getting contacts and calls
[1:12:55] and so the brother
[1:12:56] is always out and always working and
[1:12:59] it's been a privilege to be able to help
[1:13:00] him i thank god that somebody put it on
[1:13:02] the heart of a brother to give him a
[1:13:03] house that he could use for the ministry
[1:13:06] that would really support him and his
[1:13:07] household and give him an ability to
[1:13:08] keep it i think god god put that on
[1:13:10] somebody's heart
[1:13:12] i thank god we've been able to help him
[1:13:13] somewhat in the past and hopefully we
[1:13:15] can help him with a building here in the
[1:13:17] future maybe to expand the church
[1:13:20] i thank god for that and then the other
[1:13:22] brothers we haven't
[1:13:23] been doing as much as we had because
[1:13:25] coveted shut down a lot of the mission
[1:13:26] work
[1:13:27] excuse me a lot of the traveling
[1:13:30] but if things
[1:13:31] begin to pick up
[1:13:32] i want to pick up with it amen
[1:13:35] i want to be able to do what we can do
[1:13:36] amen i want to i want to follow in the
[1:13:38] tradition of the of the
[1:13:41] elders and the tradition of the apostle
[1:13:43] paul i want to keep doing the work that
[1:13:45] god's given us to do as long as we can
[1:13:48] i say you know with these experiences
[1:13:49] that we've had and seeing the brothers
[1:13:51] around the world and have them come
[1:13:52] visit us and some of our brothers go
[1:13:54] visit them
[1:13:56] it makes our experience richer
[1:13:58] deeper and it and it gives us a better
[1:14:02] understanding to me seeing these
[1:14:04] brothers in other lands gives me a
[1:14:05] better understanding of the message
[1:14:07] their perspective and their
[1:14:08] understanding
[1:14:09] and then it gives us a chance to share
[1:14:11] brotherly love brotherly love is right
[1:14:14] next
[1:14:15] to charity
[1:14:16] to perfect love
[1:14:18] if you can't have brotherly love how
[1:14:19] will you ever come to capstone love and
[1:14:22] god gives us opportunities to share that
[1:14:23] and i'm thankful
[1:14:25] that that brother lonnie started us down
[1:14:27] this track
[1:14:29] and i'm thankful that the work continues
[1:14:31] to go it's a blessing to be part of it
[1:14:33] and i thank god for a church body that
[1:14:35] has the same vision i say god bless you
[1:14:38] thank you for your support for
[1:14:39] supporting the brothers that out there
[1:14:40] supporting missions
[1:14:42] thank you for praying for us praying for
[1:14:44] our family thank you for supporting the
[1:14:45] local work
[1:14:46] i say i just want to say god bless you
[1:14:48] we love you it's good to be home i'm
[1:14:50] looking forward to
[1:14:52] being home i'm looking forward to seeing
[1:14:54] my family spending some time with them
[1:14:57] my plane
[1:14:58] landed at 5 pm in dayton
[1:15:02] i drove straight here
[1:15:04] grabbed a shower saw my family over
[1:15:06] there and come to see you and i feel
[1:15:09] like now that i've seen your faces and
[1:15:10] we've had a chance to talk to one
[1:15:12] another now i can go rest amen and my
[1:15:15] rest will be sweet because i really
[1:15:16] wanted to see and i really wanted to
[1:15:18] give you this report and tell you what a
[1:15:20] blessing time it was
[1:15:22] and so many things that took place that
[1:15:24] were unexpected you know the the
[1:15:26] fellowship of brother david the the
[1:15:29] brothers from kenya
[1:15:31] the time with moses and mercy these are
[1:15:33] things that i really wasn't my main
[1:15:35] target i was going to do a wedding but i
[1:15:37] found there was just as much fruit in
[1:15:39] these other things and when you just let
[1:15:41] god lead your footsteps you don't always
[1:15:43] know you know it's hard to go this was a
[1:15:45] hard trip to go on you don't know what's
[1:15:47] going to happen you don't know for sure
[1:15:48] that coming back is secure you don't
[1:15:50] even know they're getting in the country
[1:15:51] secure traveling is not as easy as it
[1:15:54] used to be and it has certain amount of
[1:15:56] risks but but i went because i felt like
[1:15:59] i i ought to go i felt like god wanted
[1:16:01] me to go and i'm so glad i did and i was
[1:16:04] going for one objective and that
[1:16:06] objective was a real blessing to brother
[1:16:07] abraham and his family and i'm glad that
[1:16:09] we could bless them that way
[1:16:10] but in return there was other tremendous
[1:16:12] things that were going on all around and
[1:16:14] i thank god for that so the footsteps of
[1:16:16] the righteous are truly ordered to the
[1:16:18] lord i wasn't expecting all these other
[1:16:20] fruitful events and things to take place
[1:16:23] i wasn't expecting to get the witness to
[1:16:24] brother moses's dad for an hour and a
[1:16:26] half i wasn't expecting to meet these
[1:16:28] brothers from kenya this brother from
[1:16:30] south africa and get to have a deep
[1:16:32] fellowship with him and encourage him in
[1:16:34] the word some i didn't expect all that i
[1:16:37] didn't expect to be a tribal clan elder
[1:16:41] that was a bonus
[1:16:42] but i'm going to see if i can get a
[1:16:44] plaque and put it on my wall it'll make
[1:16:46] me feel better
[1:16:47] this one say i love you god bless you
[1:16:50] thank you for praying
[1:16:51] may god continually bless us and help us
[1:16:55] to be focused on his business his work
[1:16:58] let's all stand musicians if you can
[1:17:00] come and brother ben
[1:17:05] as we part i just pray that the lord
[1:17:07] will give you a blessed weekend this
[1:17:08] weekend with the christmas weekend
[1:17:10] coming up you get to spend a lot of time
[1:17:11] with family
[1:17:13] and
[1:17:14] i hope you enjoy your time with the
[1:17:15] family
[1:17:16] and you know many of us will meet with
[1:17:18] unbelieving family as well and may god
[1:17:21] just prosper that may something good
[1:17:23] come from that time may god use it just
[1:17:25] to drop another seed just to create
[1:17:27] another little opportunity and maybe we
[1:17:29] won't even see the fruit of that for
[1:17:31] some time but but let's go with that in
[1:17:33] our hearts and in our minds that god
[1:17:34] will do something
[1:17:36] time is drawing short
[1:17:38] the world's in chaos
[1:17:41] but we've got something that the world
[1:17:43] needs
[1:17:44] and you can't force feed it to somebody
[1:17:46] you can't make them take it but but when
[1:17:48] you're there
[1:17:49] just i'm always cognizant i'm always
[1:17:52] paying attention god what would you want
[1:17:53] me to say is there's something i can say
[1:17:55] is there some opportunity to say
[1:17:56] something because you're sitting there
[1:17:58] with people you love and you know they
[1:18:00] need what you've got
[1:18:02] and you would love to share with them so
[1:18:03] may god bless you in all your family
[1:18:04] gatherings and in your time together in
[1:18:06] your homes and your families and may god
