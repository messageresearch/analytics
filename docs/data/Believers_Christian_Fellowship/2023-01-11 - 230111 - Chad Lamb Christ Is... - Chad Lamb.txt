you would just Minister unto us Lord that you would break the bread of life and Portion it out to each one of us and may we receive what we have need of we love you father and we thank you for your goodness and for your mercy pray that you have your way with us in every way today take this vessel under your control Lord and preach your word speak Eternal Words of Life Lord that bring life to our souls God that you would bring out of us all that you've placed in us that needs to be manifest in this day would you Lord bring it forth by your spirit may you accomplish your work through Us in this end time in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you let's look at our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 13. if you turn there and I want to just give you a quick update on little Marcus losing off Ellie and Natasha are doing well a little Marcus is doing well I got an update from Brother Ilya today I said Marcus is doing great and he's on zero support or oxygen whatsoever his lungs are working absorbing everything's working fine so now they just want to monitor him for a period of time make sure he's okay before they send him home so God has done a wonderful work and a quick work for that little baby so we're excited about that it was good to hear about brother lets the surgery going well and we pray that he can get home quickly and recover so remember him in prayer and also we had an opportunity to go to the viewing for brother Robert Douglas and just remember to keep the family in prayer we're thankful that our brother is released from this world of Toil and care but the family that's left behind sure is grieving and so we want to remember them remember his wife Linda and sister Tammy who fellowships here with us I was thinking when I was there talking to Mr Linda I thought brother Bob was really good friends with Brother John Matthews they used to go out witnessing together and they were like a team you know and I know some person in the sixth Dimension is really happy to have their buddy back amen and so I'm sure they've had a wonderful reunion and fellowship and I thank God that's what we all have to look forward to a wonderful reunion and fellowship one day so we thank God for that so just continue to remember them as well let's look at the Hebrews chapter 13. Hebrews chapter 13 verse 8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever God bless you as you take your seats amen brother Franco if it's ready you can pull that PowerPoint up I decided at the last minute to put my notes on PowerPoint because there's quite a few uh quotes of the Prophet that I want to read and it's and I don't want to just read I want us all to look at them together amen so I I hope that they're all in order because I flew at the last minute to put this together I just caught the inspiration last second to get it on uh PowerPoint so I hope it works out but I want to tell this Christ is and I mean that's a that's a big statement Christ is it can be followed up by many things and we're not trying to you know we're not trying to spend the next 12 hours or 12 months standing here trying to incorporate all or explain all and preach all that Christ is but I just want to take that statement and I want to look at that and just think about that for a minute and we may just get one little snippet of this but I want to look at Christ is because you know we live in a world that and we as Believers we we we use terminology all the time time and we we throw terms out and we speak in Bible terms and in message terms and but sometimes it's good to stop and say what is it I mean when I say that what am I referring to what all does this Encompass and what is the depth of my understanding in this and so I want to look at that and Christ is and we see here in Hebrews 8 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and that's such a that's such an interesting interesting scripture because it makes uh it makes such a statement that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever but we know that Jesus the man the flesh body that God made to dwell in amen that that it it was made at some point it was created right so it was it was not that body was not on the earth in existence before amen and now that body is is on the right hand of the father it's not here present now and so it's interesting when he says Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever he must be referring to something other than just that one aspect amen there's a there's a fuller dip deeper richer meaning than what our carnal mind if we just only take it as the man that was born through the Virgin Mary and lived 33 years and died at Calvary and resurrected again and send it on high if that's it it's hard to say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen but we know that that was an expression of Christ amen that was Christ expressed in full measure as a human being as a man so it was the full expression of Christ in one figure man but it wasn't the only expression of Christ so I want to look at this and and read as we go here and why it had to be Shepherds the prophet said and Christ is the word the anointed word made manifest though I love the way he says that we know Christ is the word he also says God is the word he said the word and the Holy Spirit are the self-same thing so so it's all the word and I find this so amazing when it comes down to it Christ is all and in all right he is the expression of God Amen and God is everything and so we look at these uh we terms will use God we'll use the father we'll use uh Christ we'll use uh Jesus Christ the son of God the holy spirit all of these terms but it's all God it's all God but it's God in a manifestation it's God in a way a mode of operation God and an expression and a way he wants to reveal himself or Express himself so Christ is the word the anointed word may manifest and then he goes in this message three kinds of Believers he says can you receive the word all the word all of Christ Christ is the anointed word he is the word anointed Christ means the anointed one the anointed word for that day made manifest so we we're really nailing this down Amen in the in the aspect of this statement Christ is that I want to look at Christ is the anointed word for that day okay we know these things but oh it's so much fun to look at this and realize what God has done the mystery that has been laying in the Bible hidden amen because we know that the mystery of God was revealed in the end time by the seventh angel and the sounding of the seventh angel the mystery of God shall be revealed and we know that Christ is the mystery of God revealed so God has revealed his mystery in Christ amen in Christ Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and Christ is the anointed word of that day so wherever you find the anointed word in a day you find Christ and that is a revelation of God then when we get to the end time amen God sounds the seven Thunders opens to us to see us and reveals the mystery that's been laying in the whole Bible and the Mystery that's been laying in the whole Bible was expressed all the way back in Eden when God was going to make man in his own image and his own likeness and he made them male and female and placed him in his creation to rule over his creation that was God expressing himself as male and female and then we know that that image was ruined so he could rebuild it back so that he could express all of his attributes and all of his family and restore it back to that picture many fold and and that is the mystery that's been revealed in the end time the mystery of God becoming tangible expressing himself amen becoming tangible in his creation so Christ is the mystery of God revealed and whenever you find Christ it's revealing God and and what is Christ is the anointed word for that day praise God he says Christ has identified the same in all generations now I absolutely love that title especially in the subject we're talking about Christ is identified the same in all generations Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you find his characteristics and you can find him and it's amazing when he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's not always the same exact expression will find that it was Christ in Moses it was Christ and no it was Christ and David it was Christ in Jeremiah I mean these were all expressing Christ parts of Christ the word for their day being expressed amen and it wasn't always the exact same expression it wasn't always a building an ark it wasn't always leading a a people out of bondage it wasn't always a preaching that the people were going into captivity it wasn't always a king after God's own arm and every expression was expressing another part of the word Another Part Of God was being expressed and it was Christ in that day but it's the same yesterday today and forever what makes it the same it's always the word being expressed for that day and season that makes it the same that makes it Jesus Christ the same so now he says when Moses come he could not have took Noah's message neither could Moses or Noah took Moses message and neither could Joshua have took on any other message see each one Isaiah could not have took another's message each message is for that age and with the age that we're living in when the word is interpreted God's speaking that word out and making the word for that age live giving the interpretation of it that is God in Christ manifesting see because Christ is the word and when the word is made manifest that is Christ in every age so Christ is the word may manifest in that age praise God so we look at this quote God will judge the world not by any certain group he will judge the World by Jesus Christ and Christ is the word he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and one Among Us so he is the expressed word of God in every age he makes him the same yesterday today and forever so what makes him the same yesterday today and forever is that he is the expressed word of God in every age so when the word of God is being expressed manifested fleshed out that is always Christ amen praise be to God I don't want to miss something there's yeah there's something here I do not want to miss so so we realize that Christ was here all the way in the beginning um let's look at John 1 1 together so in John 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so we're talking about the word the word was with God the Word was God and now all things were made by him by who by the word okay so let's go over to Colossians chapter one Colossians chapter 1. when we get over to Colossians chapter one let's look at verse 15. you know Colossians 1 and 15. who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature now what are we speaking about here we're talking about Jesus Christ clearly he is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell so now he's referring to the person of Jesus Christ and now Christ and this word John 1 1 and Colossians 1 are the same he made all things by the word but now when when we talk in the beginning was the word and God said let there be amen that was the coming forth of Christ amen and as that word let there be light manifest into light that was Christ all the way back there with a word made manifest and that day was Christ but it was not known as Jesus because it didn't have an Earthly name it was Christ until amen we get to the the prophecy coming through a virgin and Virgin Mary and was told what his name will be and Joseph was told what his name will be so God selected his name Jesus so it's Jesus Christ amen but before that time it was always Christ it's always been Christ but it didn't it was not known as Jesus Christ until all the word and fullness was encompassed in a body amen that would be the body that God would create for himself to dwell in and he would take the Earthly name as Jesus Christ and from then on forward and backwards you can refer to the word as Jesus Christ [Music] so so there was a time now we know the word is eternal it's not bound by time but I'm looking at an Earthly perspective now from an Earthly perspective there was a time before Jesus there was still Christ that makes sense we know in the mind of God in the Eternal Realms there's no before and after is eternal but there was a time but then later that expression would be bottled up in Jesus and then we knew what this was now we say in the beginning was the word that's a title but now we can give the word a name it's Jesus Christ praise God so let's go to Hebrews chapter 11. Hebrews chapter 11. and let's go to verse 24. Hebrews 11 and 24 by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ this was before the manifestation of Jesus the man it was still Christ and so now with this is Christ we know that this is Hebrews 13 8 this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but he wasn't known as Jesus Christ in that day esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured is seeing him who is invisible amen what was the what was the reproach of Christ it was the reproach of the word for that day that he was part of these slaves and he was here to as a redeemer he's one selected to to be the vessel that God would use to call him out and he was there representing God because God would come down and speak to Moses in a burning bush and say I've heard the cries of my people and I have come down to deliver them now come I'm sending you so he was going to be the representation amen of God's plan and God's word for that day so what was Moses reflecting what was Moses manifesting Moses was projecting Christ his life became the projection of Christ amen and later what was in Moses would be in Jesus Christ because all the word was there and now have a name so we know what was it what was it that Moses first took off for he forsook all for Jesus Christ but in that day he didn't know him as Jesus Christ he just knew it as the word of God and that was Christ let's go to First Corinthians 10. First Corinthians First Corinthians chapter 10. and verse 1. First Corinthians 10 and 1. let me see if I got that right yeah let's go down to verse four and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ now we know that there was a physical Rock there was a rock that Moses smote with the rod and as he smote the rod The Rock cracked open amen and water came gushing out but that was a natural type of something spiritual that was going on in that day because we know that there was a rock that followed the children of Israel and he said they did all drink of that spiritual Rock now Paul's not talking about the rock that that he hit with the rod now he's talking about the spiritual rock that followed him and that rock was Christ it was Christ who was the Revelation for that day that was opened by the prophet in that day and out came Living Water for them to drink and to live by so now we see that Christ Christ was in Moses's day and he was the same in that day as he is this day but we're not wandering through a desert we don't have a physical man named Moses with with a long beard walking us through a physical desert amen but what was happening that day is happening this day that's happened every day it's always been a day when Christ amen is being manifested and God is revealing himself to the people and that is Christ the anointed word for that day and we have no problem saying that rock was Jesus Christ is that right does anybody have a problem saying that rock was Jesus Christ does anybody have a problem saying that it was Jesus Christ that Moses forsook Egypt for but that was there there was no physical appearance of Jesus Christ it was the word for that day and if that was true then could it be true now that in order for it to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and ever and Jesus Christ being made manifest in Jesus Christ declaring himself it doesn't mean there needs to be the Corporal body of Jesus Christ for Jesus Christ to be here revealing himself amen so we see in fact let's go over to Revelations chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10. in verse 1. I was never sure never sure how things will go but we're certainly not going the direction I thought but praise God I just encourage you to keep pulling because I'm starting to have fun and I like it this way Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we see this is a very similar description that we find over in Revelation chapter one and it's a description of Jesus Christ right so we see that there's a mighty Angel come down from heaven this is not a mighty flesh body it's a mighty Angel this is a spiritual invisible thing that's coming right and and it come down from heaven close to the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was where the sun and his fetus pillars of fire and he had a in his hand a little book open which in Revelation 5 was closed now it's open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with the loud voices when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices so now brother Branham comes to this scripture and he says the mighty Angel he said the angel of the Covenant only Christ it could be right so does anybody have any problems saying this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever who is this Christ it's Jesus Christ but not the body that was nailed to the cross this is the Angel of the Lord the angel of the Covenant this is the the mighty Angel this is Christ coming down from heaven with an open book in his hand and then he cries with a loud voice and seven Thunders out of their voice and they're sealed but now in the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen the mystery of God shall be revealed as he's declared to his servants the prophets and brother Branham comes to this portion of scripture and he says now he says the seventh angel which is the seventh Church age messenger which is William Branham will be on Earth at the time of this coming who came Jesus Christ came I I don't have any problem saying that but not the Corporal body coming but the mighty Angel amen the fullness of the person of Christ as he brought the fullness of the word the headship coming to the body praise be to God praise God and so we see so he is the expressed word of God in every age that makes him the same yesterday today and forever now what was so unique is when in the Old Testament as we're coming down to the prophets the Patriarchs and the prophets and moving our way through it's always a portion of Christ a manifestation of Christ a portion of Christ a a a a part for That season that's being played out and then it was all the way down through until it comes to the person of Jesus Christ himself in fullness now everything that they were every portion that was portioned down and every portion that will be portioned out in the future was all bottled and confined in one body and that body was the fullness of the word is that right so now this wasn't a day of partial this was a manifestation of fullness amen that's the difference that's why you couldn't say you could say it was Christ and Moses but you couldn't say that was the person of Jesus Christ or all of Christ you can't say that amen because it was a portion praise God but you shouldn't say that wasn't Jesus Christ you see what I'm saying the line is so tight you can't deny that that was Christ but it wasn't the full expression the full expression was going to come and we saw it now in the unveiling of God he says notice veiled in human flesh Moses with that word speaking what was to be later put behind Badger skin so is Christ Our Moses Christ is our Moses he was God veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity and flesh that's right and he's the same yesterday today and forever what does he say is here God veiled in humanity and now he says he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he was veiled by Badger skins he was veiled and this time he was veiled in a man now notice same yesterday today and forever promised his word to this age he is still Christ The Promised word to this age veiled in human flesh the word is God so he's still Christ The Promised word to this age but where is he veiled in human flesh and we saw it veiled in that prophet he said the word is God the anointing is a person the word Christ means anointed one the anointed one then Moses was Christ in his day he was the anointed when Jeremiah was Christ in his day with a portion of the word for that day but when Jesus came he came as the Redeemer anointed one and that was both Moses and all that was in Moses and all the word and all the godhead bodily was in him that's the reason the whole temple veil rant and The Mercy Seat come in perfect view he was the anointed one notice now the veil in human flesh the the promised word to this age must also be veiled sin loving church members and sinners cannot see it because of the human Veil you say this is Christ being made manifest and people say where are the nail scars this is Jesus Christ amen but where are the nail scars it's the same as it was in that day's the same as it is in this day it's Christ being made manifest through flesh through Veil through a veil says in the message there is a man here who can turn on the line said God's word comes only by the Bible God's Bible is the printed form of the Son of God because the Bible said that it is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word and remember we're still on the topic of Christ is God's revealing himself through Christ because God God if we could I'm going to say things because I only know how to as a human being right language is so inferior to express this but before God expressed his thought and how reform he expressed it we can say in word but that that's really for us to understand something because God's an eternal spirit so in the day when there was nothing there to hear him was it an audible voice with vocal cords like these in human lips right so God spoke what does it mean to speak it means to take the thought and declare it we do that by speaking but sometimes we write it down but when we write it down it's still expressing a thought it's still a word and it still speaks something so God we know his first expression was the logos amen his first expression was something that came out of him that was the word and brother bear said he saw brother remember said it was as a glowing amber light a pillar of fire and that was God now beginning to speak his word so so when when saying don't don't think brother Ted got sacrilegious and denied everything because you may not have heard anything that day because nobody there had ears he was God who dwelt alone he wasn't even God yet he was the great Elohim the self-existent one and he was going to create something that could hear a voice but before then he spoke so what does it mean to speak it means uh uh he declared something or something from his thought was declared or manifested and that was the word so God was before the word now I know the word is eternal so don't think you're I'm saying something wrong I don't know how else to express this before there was an expression and you can't say before because we're back in eternity where there's no before and after so I we're so limited friends I don't even know how to preach about this stuff because all I have is words you know and words and back then they didn't even need words so now if there has a way there had to be a way for God to take what was inside of and what his thoughts were his attributes himself and express it and that expression is called word and the first it was expressed was in the form of logos a spiritual form of God and that was the word and all of the thoughts of God were in the logos and out of the logos everything was made it was I mean brother Bemus describes this in so many different ways but but I'm not going to go into that right now so but God is revealing himself through Christ so Christ is the word made manifest in the day so it says God's expecting himself through Christ you could almost look at this as two different entities we have gone then we have Christ it's really the same person it's God but it's God expressing himself because God really was before the expression does that make sense so then when we say Christ is the expression of God well what is Christ Christ is God but it's what God had invisible and unspoken and Unknown by anybody that is his attributes God himself Amen in order to express himself he was going to have to use a form called word and when that word would take on action and manifest itself it was going to call it Christ but what is it it's still him because it all goes back to his thought everything goes back to the thought of God so in everything that goes back to the thought of God is God because it's God's attributes which are his thoughts which is him that he's divided up and portioned over time it's still God we call it Christ we call it the word we call it the Holy Spirit we call it but it's still God but it's a way in which God can begin to express himself so that we would understand what was hidden inside of him now can be understood by portions of himself amen that could comprehend him so that he could have fellowship with himself I can't wait to get Beyond language and human intellect and experience the reality of what we're trying to express so we call it Christ but it's what was in God's mind being expressed moving into a manifestation and that is Christ and that's revealing God it's God revealing himself through Christ and Christ is the word and it takes the light of God to shine upon that word to vindicate it to prove that God still speaks life eternal life he speaks natural light brings life life only comes by the Light the word made manifest or made flesh that last sentence I want to lock in on for a minute life only comes by light the word made manifest or made flesh so what brings Life Light what is light light is illumination it's symbolic very symbolic in the Bible so God uses natural light to symbolize spiritual light and it takes light for life so the first thing that God would create in the days of creation would be light because light was going to bring forth life and no life would come forth without light and so the first thing that God did when he was the great Elohim the self-existent one by himself the first thing he did was Express himself his word and that word took on the form of light and from light there can be life without light there can be no life so we we were in this world trapped in darkness so what did God do God revealed his word to us which is light he turned on the light for us so that what was in us laying dormant could come to life and there is no life without the light and the light is the word made manifest or made flesh [Music] so let's take this back to Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever with in the beginning was the word Christ without him was not anything made in him was life and the life was the light of men without the word there was no lives there was there was other attributes of God were never going to take on another expression without the light and the light was going to Quicken them so life only comes by light the word made manifest or made flesh so if you think about uh think about Israel let's just take Israel for example they're down the nation of Israel as though it's dead it's in a grave called Egypt right they're supposed to be in the promised land they're supposed to have the inheritance and that whole portion is dead to them now because they're in a grave because even God refers to bringing them out of the graves when he brings them out of the Nations he brings them out of the graves because as a nation they're dead to the promise they're dead everything's dead they're in bondage and slavery I mean down in Egypt amen and what is going to bring them out there has to be a word made manifest that'll be light and that light will bring life to the nation of Israel and it will quick them from the Quicken them from the dead slave condition they're in in Egypt and it will bring them into newness of life and restore them back to what God's thought was for them from before the foundation of the world without Moses representing Christ and displaying that portion of Christ there would be no light the light in that day amen was the word for that day made flesh and it was made flesh in Moses so now we have a human being a human Veil Badger skins amen and the word is behind that it's God working through Moses and it's an expression of Christ which becomes light for that day which brings life to the word for that day so so life only comes by light the word may manifest or made flesh so we can say amen hallelujah that's nothing but the truth because they would have never resurrected out of Egypt without that portion of the word and tell Moses the prophet came until the Redeemer came amen until God worked through that vessel to to complete his word to perform the prophecy and bring them out they would have laid dead in Egypt as a nation but they were renewed to life quickening power came the light came and brought that Nation to life when when God come and worked Christ through Moses that's the truth but if it was a truth in that day he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's the very same thing today without the manifested word for the hour there is no life we want to have life everywhere else life here like no life only comes by light which is the manifested word for the day the word made flesh so where does the manifestation manifested word in this day because where you find that that's light and that light brings life and outside of that there's no life amen so there was one light there is not Methodist Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian Christ is the light and the light is life and the word manifested is the light of the hour do we believe it amen so where is life where there is light what is light the word manifested for the hour what is that that is Christ what is Christ doing revealing God amen oh praise God in Galatians 4 19 the Apostle Paul says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you now Paul the Apostle Paul is now the the prophet to the Gentiles he's the first church age messenger he's taking the message of grace to the Gentiles to fulfill all kinds of prophecies and as he's there he's telling them I'm laboring in the ministry I'm working under labor pains until Christ be formed in you so if what Paul is laboring for and what Paul is Desiring is accomplished what will be the end result of all of Paul's efforts the end result will be Christ in the church that's what he's laboring for that's what he's pushing for that's what he's ministering for he's laboring again in pain until Christ be formed in you so where where will Christ be in the church that's what Paul is trying to work towards in the in the message perfect Faith the prophet said Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it came because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word this is so good you you this is why you can't just say I'm the word I'm the word I'm the word no there must be a receiving of the word amen in that receiving of the word is you receiving light and that light bringing life to the word that's laying dormant inside of you and that light that light that word will come to life it'll be quickened and it will begin to live a life producing light that may bring somebody else to life but you become the word as you receive the word and so so there's so many times we make things so complicated I mean even in the in the way of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost we make it so complicated and brother Branham teaches it I mean there's two aspects to the baptism the Holy Ghost there's one as an experience there's a death he says there's a definite experience and what is the experience if you read all that he says he really can sum it up this way it's the experience of a changed life your soul change you change something and you changed you were going one way you went another way you changed and then he has the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the evidence is you're able to receive all the word for your day not previous days future days but your day so you have an experience and an Evidence right so so the it's amazing how Jesus before he leaves his disciples we know there's a promise of the Holy Spirit coming but Jesus breathed on his disciples think about this breathed on his disciples and he told them receive ye the Holy Ghost so so what's he saying the breath of Christ the breath of Jesus Christ he breathed on them and told them to receive the Holy Ghost so there was something that was going to come from his mouth which is word and they are to receive the Breath of God which is the word of God that's why water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is so critical because it's the word and you must be baptized correctly not in titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost but under the right baptism which is the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because with that brings the right revelation of who Christ is what if God is it's the right understanding of the godhead and with baptism in that name you have received the proper word for your day because it's contrary to all denominational teaching I mean the understanding of the godhead is contrary to all denominational teaching and you've received that word amen that has come from that prophet and receiving that word when you receive that word then now you're a candidate to re if you repent and receive the word now you're a candidate to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so you become the word and the Holy Spirit in the word is the self-same thing that's what brother Brahm says the word has a life behind it has a life to it and the spirit is the life of the word amen and you become the word when you receive the word and I'm not talking about an intellectual consent or an intellectual agreeing but when something in you identifies that that's nothing but the truth then I tell you just receive the word and let God do the rest open yourself up to Christ and say God come in that word take complete preeminence in me amen so you become the word as you receive the word keep receiving the word keep letting the spirit of God influence your life the spirit of the word bring changes it says in the token message says when you are subject then you are subject for the resurrection because the resurrection power is already in you the token is the resurrection power showing that Jesus raised up from the dead and you are raised from the dead the dead things of unbelief and have been made alive in the word of Jesus Christ you believe it and the word lives through you so you become the word as you receive the word and you believe it okay so now we understand what receiving is not just saying yes pretty good idea it's better than any other explanation I heard I'll agree with it no friend it's a genuine faith in the word of God you believe it and the word lives through you then in Christ is the mystery of God he says that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express itself in Christ then Express himself through the church in the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them okay so when the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them I want to talk about this just for a moment I don't want to just read these statements and move on but what I want to absorb what the prophet is telling us and what does this mean so let's let's look at the Virgin Mary there was a prophecy laying in Isaiah 7 14 that a virgin shall conceive that was the word it was spoken by a prophet and that word would have a due season when it would come into manifestation all right so Christ is the word the anointed word made manifest for that age we got it so there was the word but that word must become the manifested word for that age so there was a specific age appointed for a virgin shall conceive Isaiah's prophecy to be fulfilled so somewhere in a vicinity of 700 years later amen Angel Gabriel shows up to speak to a virgin Amen in Nazareth and begins to tell her you're highly favored and she has no idea about any of this she I mean it wasn't like her parents were telling her you're going to be the virgin of Isaiah 7. I mean she had no clue she was just living life going to fetch water doing all she can making wedding preparations and all of the stuff that that she was doing as a teenage girl and and then the angel would come and tell her you don't know who you really are you've you've thought one thing you've been identified one way but I've come to bring you another identification you don't really know who you are but you really are the word that must be made manifest in this day and so now she she she is uh contemplating and questioning and she questions Angel how can these things be says I know not a man and she's looking scientifically and naturally he gives her a spiritual answer and a holy ghost shall ever shatter you overshadow thee and then and she you know she doesn't get a real clear answer but she got an answer that was good enough and then in verse 38 this is Luke chapter one she says be it unto me according to Thy Word you see the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them Mary she was the predestinated word do we believe that I don't believe God I don't believe if she would have refused God would have picked Plan B I don't think God has plan B known unto God from the beginning of the world or all of his Works amen and we are ordained in Christ Jesus under good works God knows what we're going to do he has already pre-selected every vessel for its purpose amen so if she would have said no God's not going to pick another one she was ordained before the foundation of the world to be the Fulfillment of that thought of God that was expressed through a prophet that was written in the Bible and now there was a season that had to come manifest but it needed to move from predestinated word to manifested word and there was a key in between these two and the key was the woman herself saying be it unto me according to your word she had to believe it and then let it flow through her John the Baptist couldn't just come and say I believe I believe Malachi 3 that there's going to be somebody who's going to prepare the way and make straight the path of the Lord I believe that word well that was wonderful it's good to believe that it's not ever bad to believe that he couldn't have been saying you know I believe there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness I mean that that's also that's a wonderful thing but that wasn't what was needed in that day because for Generations people have believed that word was true and then it doesn't do any good also for John the Baptist to say you know what I think I'm that voice the one crying in the woods I think I'm the one to prepare the way of the Lord that's also wonderful but that still isn't Christ amen because Christ is the word made manifest John the Baptist had to actually take what he believed and allow that prophecy to flow through him and actually go out and prepare the way of the Lord he actually had to preach the gospel the coming of the Kingdom the coming of Messiah he had to baptize unto repentance he actually had to let the word flow through his flesh vessel agreeing with the word and letting and obeying the word and letting the word flow through him and when he did he became Christ in that day the manifested word of that day amen praise God so there's so many so many things like this in the Bible I mean Moses mother convinced him that he was the Redeemer born a proper child so he had the right understanding of the scripture but yet no manifestation he had he had been taught intellectually through a mother who had told him you were born a proper child you were born at the right time and we have a revelation you're the Redeemer you're the one that's going to bring us out and and he believed it and he tried to act upon it in his own accord amen and he failed miserably he goes into the Wilderness for 40 years and then God comes to approach him and call him back into his commission amen and then he begins to stumble around and say he can't do it and he's not able and and there's this whole dialogue with God and also God doesn't have a plan B here so God is in dialogue with money you say why didn't he strike him dead because he doesn't have a plan B Moses is the Fulfillment of the scripture he is carrying within him the predestinated word for That season but it must move from predestinated word to manifested word and God has got to get Moses to yield to the word and when Moses yields to the word it moves from predestinated word to manifested word and when it's manifested word it becomes light and that light becomes life and a whole nation is saved perfect so we realized that Jesus Christ is the anointed word made manifest in that day so we must be like the virgin like Moses like John the Baptist I believe amen I believe that God has called me for this hour amen I believe that I'm part on Eternal thought of God that he had of me I believe that I'm predestinated to be here in this hour and there's a prophecy laying in me a word to be fulfilled but nothing's going to happen until I and my own free choice my free moral agency lay down my life and surrender to the word that's been handed and I get baptized in his name I dress the way he said I talked the way he says I Surrender everything all my thoughts all my previous understanding of the Bible all my own wishes I lay it all down and I Surrender the word and become the manifested word by letting the word for the hour flow through me and that brings light and that brings life you can see what a hindrance it is to say I am to say that I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ but I want to cut my hair I want to wear jewelry I want to wear makeup I want to I want to join with systems I want to have my own way I still want to do a little side deal on the side I I think the brother Brandon was right in all these areas but you see what a hindrance it is because the predestinated word must be manifested word and we become the word when we let the word flow through us how do we let it flow through us being unto me according to your words if that's what you're calling for in this hour that's what you're going to have that's what I'm going to surrender to you I'm going to quit all my little deals I'm going to quit my associations I'm going to surrender my own thinking because the manifested word is the light of the hour so it becomes so important to know the day we live in in what the predestinated word is for this hour and then yield ourselves to become the manifested word in this hour because that will bring life in this hour modern events May clear by prophecy he says when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again the same one that went in the ground come back to be the bride who's that one who went in the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so the one who went to the ground Jesus Christ come back to be the bride what did he come back for what was his return in this age he came back to be the bride all right so that's why we see there's such a misunderstanding on the coming of the Lord because this is the rapture coming where he comes to take his bride away in order to do that he first comes reveals himself to her unites with her each member and then he takes her away so this is the coming of the Lord for the Rapture not the coming of the Lord to the 144 000 and not the coming of the Lord to set up the millennial Kingdom but this is the rapture coming he's come to claim what's his he's come to take her to himself amen and to free her from all denomination and fear from all man's understanding so she's no longer manhandled and take her unto himself in an invisible Union and when he comes this time he's not going to come with nail scarred hands the prophet said we don't look for nails guard hands we look for the word made manifest because the word made manifest is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the difference between this and the church ages through every Church age you had a portion yeah of the word just like Moses just like Abraham just like Dave but then when Jesus came it was the fullness of the word then through seven Church ages amen because they left the teachings of Paul they've had portions of the word and portions of the word and brother bear said a dip in the Holy Spirit is that right portion portion portion but when we get to the end of the church ages now the fullness is coming back again Christ the full word of God Amen is going to return to the body to his body what body the bride body and it's going to be Jesus Christ again remember what the prophet told us over and over again he said all that God was he poured into Christ amen all that Christ was he poured into the church when at the opening of the seals when the mighty angel came down when the headship came to unite with the body now it's not portioned that's why when you had portion of the word you had a dip in the spirit you had part of the spirit because the word and the spirit are the self same thing yes so now it's no longer dip in the spirit dip in the spirit partial life partial life partial life but now we've come where he himself the full word now can express himself through his body through the bride and it brings light and it brings life so when the same one that went in the ground come back to be the bride that's why they missed his coming that's why the world missed his coming because he came back to be the bride and when and and that's the prophecy and fulfillment of the word for this hour and we become the word when we let the word flow through us come back to be the bride just the bride and the groom is the same Flesh and Blood the same Ministry and the same things doing just exactly what he done the spirit and modern events made clear he says and so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts now look how he inserts Restoration in the gifts because he's showing what looked like in the Pentecostal Revival was the long sought after promise of of the return of the full spirit of God it wasn't that it just looked like that it was the restoration of the gifts so after justification sanctification baptism Holy Spirit restoration and gifts right on into the formed image of Christ what is the formed image of Christ Christ in Bride form he's already been expressed in bridegroom form when he was here on Earth two thousand years ago but in this coming he's being expressed in the formed image of Christ which is Christ in Bride form in his bride body Christ is the bridegroom the church is the bride and the Bride is a part of the bridegroom it'll have to be a word church not a denominational Church it'll be the word church the word that's made known and by the Vindicated word of God she'll be the word for this day when she lets the word for this day flow through her praise be to God First Corinthians 12 27 says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular man the body of Jesus Christ that was that was laid in the manger 2000 years ago that was the Lamb of God that was a created body of God with the creative blood of God that would pay the price of redemption for us all yes but that body was smitten and something was taken out of that body word and spirit to begin making another body just like Adam and the woman in the beginning and now God and and we've said this before but it's worth saying again when God laid Adam down and took a rib out of Adam's side and took the finished Spirit out of Adam and he formed woman now this woman what body did she have amen because God took a part of the body of Adam and made the body of the woman so he took a part of the body of Adam and made the body of the woman and he called their name Adam but what gave life to that woman was the spirit and that spirit that was in her was first in Adam is that right so God split Adam's Spirit between masculine and feminist took the feminist out and put it in there so now that's the body of Adam's spirit is that right making it Adam's Body that and the two were one so the same picture he lays down there is the same picture he wants us to understand there he says now ye are the body of Christ where is Christ where is Christ empty tomb and his body has went into heaven Hey listen Apostle Paul's saying now in this dispensation in this manifestation you are the body of Christ if you want to know where Christ is you find his body if you want to know where I am you must find my body because I can only dwell in this body in this dispensation in this period of time is that right so you want to find me you must find your body if you want to find Christ you should find his body ye are the body of Christ and members in particular that's why just like Moses could not claim he was all of Christ none of us can claim that we're the person of Jesus Christ amen we can but the body the bride body as a whole all that Christ well God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church amen and now they're bottling and confining Christ so individually we're only a little portion of this but through the whole body through seven Church ages it's Christ's body and now in the last time for this end time bride the full portion of the word amen which it brings the Full Life of Christ the full spirit of God has been poured into her and now she is the full reflection of Christ she is now the formed image of Jesus Christ because he doesn't have to repeat on this Earth the bridegroom form he did it now he's got to finish the Masterpiece that had got ruined back in Eden to finish that he must bring forth the bride for him now into completion unite the two is one then he can clean the Earth off amen and bring it back that's the portion of the word that we're to live out which is Christ amen dwelling in Bride form each of us have a portion but we must each yield ourselves to the portion for us to live so that Christ can be displayed in full measure through his bride globally not any one of us have it all we can't claim to have it all amen but but we but don't ever cut me out of it either I've got Christ Living in me I may not have all of Christ but whatever I the portion I've got amen is the portion that's allotted to me and it's the same Jesus Christ that's been around forever yesterday today and forever in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 29 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourish and cherish it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones huh I don't think I don't think Paul can make it any clearer somehow it's been missed the full scope the full plan the the full reality of this has been missed for generations for two thousand years but in the end time God has wanted to bring us back to this reality this is what was supposed to happen after Christ gave his life for his bride God smote him in the side to take out of him the elements to make his bride which was the smitten word and the life [Music] and he was going to bring amen that word to them amen and bring that life back to them at Pentecost and bring the word to them but they fell from the word amen and they handicapped are they chained or they blocked off the full measure of the word which blocked off the full measure Liberty of the spirit right that's what the prophet of God said the Holy Spirit now has been bound in these denominational Rivers for nearly 2 000 years but will be loosed was bound but he's not bound anymore we'll be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Ghost back in the church again so what is she being formed into the formed image of Christ the body coming back to this word and this purpose when Paul laid it down now is being fulfilled in our day but we become this word when we let this word flow through us when we say be it unto me with all the consequences with all the rejection with all the changing my own plans when Mary said being unto me according to your word she didn't know if Joseph would still accept her she didn't know if her parents would kick her out of her house she didn't know what the consequences would be she didn't know what the priesthood would do she didn't know what her Nation would do she had no idea what her future life would be but something in her could identify with what that angel messenger was saying and she something from within not from her intellect because her intellect would have boggled her up amen just like you're in mine intellect will Boggle us up and have us thinking we can't be it's not possible I don't live the right kind of Life I'll never be good enough but you got to go deeper than that to something that says I know that's the truth I know it's right whatever that angel said that identification is who I really am and be it unto me according to your word let's go to uh the Luke chapter one together I just want to look at this Luke chapter one and we'll start at verse 38 with the verse that I just quoted and then I'm going to move to another one and Mary said behold the hand man of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her now we know she left and she went to visit Elizabeth Elizabeth was carrying John the Baptist at this time and when she comes and gives a salutation gives a greeting amen Elizabeth is now filled with the Holy Ghost and begins to prophesy but I want to go to verse 45 this is the tail end of what she says said and blessed is she that believed this is the key to the whole Bible it has all been based on faith it has always been based on faith and blessed is she that believed for that little word four means because blessed is she that believe for there shall be perform a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord God could tell her her position God could send an angel to tell her who she is and the prophecy that she's coming under the scripture that she used to fulfill but she has to believe it in order for it to be performed she has to believe it and she has to surrender to it and in this day for Christ to be to for the bride the body the church the the be the formed image of Christ she has to hear from an angel messenger her identification and the prophecy for the day she must identify herself with it she must surrender to it yield to it uh acknowledge it believe it all of those things and then let it flow through her you have to believe it if we're still riddled with doubts we're not there yet and I'm I'm not talking about the doubts that always come you make a mistake that's just the devil troubling your mind but if you've never had that experience of of Christ personally revealing your position to you that you know you're part of this end time message maybe despite all the obstacles in your life despite all the the hindrances that are around or the mistakes but something inside has come alive and said it's me I looked in that mirror and said it's me mama it's me I'm the one they're talking about and you believe it and then surrender to it and become the word by letting the word flow just a couple more no no notice we then we become part of him as you are the veil that veils him you are part of him as long as Christ is in you as Christ was of God because God was in him made him God it's a mouthful but it works both ways and as Christ is in you the hope of glory you become part of Christ he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also see you become part of Christ as long as Christ is hidden you then it's veiled to the unbeliever but you know he's in you you are templing Christ that's behind the veil the skin behind because of the Veil The Veil again in human flesh hides God the word from the unbeliever so where is the word it's hidden in plain sight what is a manifestation for this hour hidden in plain sight just as much as John the baddest was hidden in plain sight Jesus Christ was hidden in plain sight the Virgin Mary was hidden in plain sight but it was this flesh Veil that hid them from the eyes of the people but it was there for anybody who could believe same thing's true today the choosing of a bride he says the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are one are we getting it now amen is it sinking in deeper is it striking something way down on the inside and you can recognize that is me that's my scripture that's my portion that's why I'm here that's what I'm here for I'm not here to live my own life I am here to surrender to him in every Avenue of my life so that the word will be expressed in my conduct my conversation my workplace my family as a mother as a grandmother as a grandfather as a dad as a co-worker as a whatever I'm here for Christ to display himself in me that is my whole portion that's what I'm here to do and that way nobody has an excuse nobody can pass this off to the ministry nobody can pass this off to gifted people it is the full body of Jesus Christ fingers toes uh wrinkles hairs everything it's the full body giving a full expression ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and every member must be yielded to this Revelation and allowing the word to flow through them we don't pass it off to a select few no it's me Lord I'm the one you want to live through I'm the one you want to express yourself through and stop thinking great big things because if you start doing that you'll be waiting all your life for the time that you can raise the Dead you'll be waiting all your time where you can manifest a spoken word and you won't realize that it's every day he wants to express the word through you and the way you dress yourself the style you put on the the fashion either you reject or take on Amen the the way you have conversations the way you share the word the way you conduct your family the way you treat one another what is that it's the word flowing through you and we don't recognize it's the simplicity of Christ in you at work at home alone with your children with your family it's Christ in you and the two together makes the one body again the message it is the rising the sun he said you believe that we shall rise in him we become part of him the Easter the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death he's talking about the first Easter Jesus coming out of the grave but he's taking it right to this day and brother banham if you can receive it we'll take it right to you in your seat right now the revealed Secret Of God like it was then of life after death we are now alive who were once dead in sin and trespassing oh what life is he talking about now the manifested word for this day brought life that light brought life to this scene and I have had my Easter experience I've come out of the Grave behind the big rock of false Revelation amen it's been rolled away and I by the Light of the manifested word for the day have come to life I have had my Easter in this message [Music] praise God the the true Easter seal has broken death from around me amen and I'm alive what did Brother Bear I'm talking about he's talking about his own life let's bring it home to our own lives said the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal now he's going right back to the Jesus Christ being be in the Tomb the stone rolled over a big Roman seal to fix to it but the Easter seal broke the Roman seal and the Roman seal was was man's ideas and denominationalism in our day and the Easter seal has broke that seal for you and I they're Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret amen and now gone by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in US for now we are quickened with him has the word brought you to life has the light of the hour woke you up and brought you to life amen and you've had your Easter amen now let the light shine through you to bring somebody else into Easter in Romans Apostle Paul says so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness so I want to follow this closely if Christ be in you means you receive the spirit of God the body is dead your body is dead but you didn't fall over dead you died to self you died to the desires of the outer man the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you what's he saying what the Apostle Paul is saying he's not talking about a future Resurrection although that applies what he's showing is you were dead in sin and trespasses your body is dead because of hybridization you come to this world dead amen making choices of the Dead loving the things of the Dead right is dead in the Sin but you're alive your spirit is life because of righteousness because God has come in now you're alive so now with the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you that's what made you alive it now will Quicken your mortal body and bring this body into the life of the word and make this body live the word so why so that you can let the word flow through you so that you can become the manifested word in a hybrid body in a fallen body you can become the manifested word if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead it shall also Quicken your mortal body and bring it to life of the word amen will it also Quicken your mortal body if you die absolutely but it needs to be quick and now to be brought subject to the word and the message it is the rising of the sign he said the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in the last day you believe the son which is Jesus Christ is the son Jesus Christ so the sun has got to be revealed again in the bride in this last day the quickening powers got to come Quicken them out of these dead denominations and Creeds to a Living Word of the Living God and things that are to be he says now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by the nominationalism we must live by the word why if the word flows through you you the word for the day it has to be the word not our ideas or somebody else's ideas or our own concept it's got to be the word we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour and the manifestation of the word for this hour is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it is Christ it's Christ in Bride form it's Jesus Christ in the formation of the Bride it's the son that's got to be revealed in the bride is him who's come back to be the bride how many other ways do we need to say you this whole message is you it's you it's you and me that's the body he wants to live in that's the body that has to express the full measure of Jesus Christ in this day it's the predestinated word that must in this hour become the manifested way and it will do it when we surrender when we believe the word and surrender to the word and let it flow through us what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his body the finished part of his body expressing the full measure of Christ as a bride that's the hour we live in that's the calling we've been called to that's the thing we must believe and surrender to you that's why this goes so far beyond church membership Church attendance group thinking you can see why that's never going to work in this hour being part of the group will never accomplish this going along with others will never accomplish this mental agreement will never accomplish as being educatedness that will never accomplish this in order for Christ to be manifest in the bride every member of that body must be yielded and he must be in control and then as she surrenders he begins to live his word through her and manifest himself in his body the completion of his body where did the mighty Angel go that that angel that spirit that angel of the Covenant Christ he came to unite with his body the head came to the body to do what to manifest himself again I want to read this one last scripture let's all stand together we'll read it together the musicians could come and brother Ben if you'll come Colossians chapter 1 verse 15 whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory the whole plan is waiting on this bride to come to perfection to recognize who she is as an angel has identified her and for her to forget about all the intellectual understanding how shall this be I know not a man how can this be and how will that happen but just to surrender and say be it unto me I believe it be it unto me I believe it and now I'm surrendered to it you can have this vessel to finish your work the bride can only be the body of Christ if she is yielded to the word how can this be the the finishing completion of the body of Jesus Christ if the that portion that member of the body is constantly defying his word he is the word she must also be the word to be the completion of his body in order to be the word she must receive the word she must believe the word and she must let the word flow through her nothing less will work we're through the we're beyond the time of playing this is reality say God make it a reality in me I mean let's bow our heads and think going dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your word for God there's no way that we could have ever identified ourselves we could have opened a Bible and read from cover to cover and we could have never identified where we were who we were but God you sent an angel in this dispensation of time at the very end of the church ages you send an angel Messenger to identify your little bride to call her bride to change her from church to bride so that she will understand what it is you're trying to tell her God I pray that you would help us Lord to have eyes to see and ears to hear God make this a living reality inside of us God we believe we're here because we believe God we surrender because we believe Lord help us to surrender more God made you accomplish through this body what you intended to accomplish your bride body that's on Earth at the end time may she be fully surrendered to you and may each one of us Lord be genuine and real Lord help us God to be sincere and consecrated and dedicated for each member must be fully committed Lord help me not to hinder any other part of your body help me not to hinder your work but help me to believe and to surrender God I love you and I thank you Father for what you're doing we could have never done this for ourselves we could have never identified ourselves we could have never properly identified the hour we're living in to even look for the right manifestation but God you came and you demonstrated it you Vindicated it you showed it to us so we would know the very hour that we're in the very dispensation of time and the portion of the word that you want to fulfill you've identified it and we believe it now Lord help us to move from the predestinated word into the manifested word each one of us as individuals personally for me God I'm asking that you would help me to move from the predestinated word because I believe I'm that I believe it Lord by faith I've received that Revelation but help me to completely move from predestinated word to a complete manifested word whatever you wanted to manifest before the foundation of the world through this Tabernacle I want to yield completely to that to become that manifested thought it's expressed in this day and I know Lord that'll be Christ expressed to the world help me to surrender take preeminence now Lord amongst us as we yield ourselves to you while we're looking to you to finish the work that you've set for this day and hour God you don't need us to do anything you just need us to surrender you don't need us to try you don't need us to come up with ideas or plans you just need us to die to surrender to give up and to let you have control help us to do that now in Greater ways than ever before we love you father and we ask that you have your way with us in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] oh that he is the same oh he's the same yesterday [Music] and foreign [Music] to tell the world the same
