[0:23] amen it's it's not as though we're
[0:25] having to
[0:27] really work hard to make a sacrifice of
[0:29] praise he's drawing it right out of us
[0:31] and the revelation is lifting us on a
[0:34] higher plane and
[0:35] we're connecting to him in a greater way
[0:37] than we ever have before and
[0:38] praise is just flowing out of us unto
[0:41] him what a wonderful thing friends it's
[0:43] just a beautiful place to be and
[0:45] you know i was preparing yesterday and
[0:49] i knew somebody was praying i didn't
[0:51] know who and i didn't know
[0:53] but i knew somebody was praying because
[0:54] the presence of god came down so strong
[0:57] in my study
[0:58] i was just weeping i couldn't even study
[1:00] i couldn't do anything but walk around
[1:01] in circles and
[1:03] and i if i could live right there
[1:07] i would stay there every moment of my
[1:09] life
[1:10] it's the most wonderful thing when he
[1:12] when he comes and just does something
[1:14] personal
[1:15] and i just loved it and i just i was
[1:17] just relishing in it and i just wanted
[1:19] it so whoever's been praying thank you
[1:21] keep it up i love it you know i just
[1:24] want us all to be in that atmosphere to
[1:26] be more spiritually tuned in than we
[1:28] ever have before
[1:29] god's wanting us to be dedicated unto
[1:32] him he's calling for a spirit-led life
[1:34] a spirit-filled life i mean not to go
[1:36] through the motions not to
[1:38] have a form of religion but to be amen
[1:41] the manifestation of the word to be
[1:43] a living word in our day to have god
[1:47] within living his life yes that's what
[1:50] he's called for in this hour and
[1:52] and i long for it more and more and more
[1:54] every day
[1:55] let's take our bibles and turn to isaiah
[1:57] 46
[1:58] we're going to continue in the third
[2:00] seal
[2:02] and then the more i look in the seal the
[2:03] bigger it gets
[2:05] and i thought you know it might be one
[2:06] part or two parts and it's getting to be
[2:08] i think the third part on the third seal
[2:11] and we'll see what the lord does if we
[2:13] can finish up or not
[2:14] but we will we will do our very best to
[2:17] follow the leading of the lord
[2:19] amen it's good to have brother craig
[2:21] bower back amen god bless you brother
[2:23] i talked to him this morning he said he
[2:25] had a very exciting trip a lot of things
[2:27] happening
[2:28] so he's going to take this wednesday
[2:29] service for us and give us an update and
[2:31] minister for us
[2:32] and i'm very excited to hear what's
[2:34] happening because he was very
[2:35] excited amen and that's that's wonderful
[2:38] god's really moving
[2:40] and then i want to remind you that this
[2:41] coming sunday brother esther
[2:43] um brother nestor espanola from the
[2:46] philippines will be here ministering for
[2:47] us
[2:48] and then camp starts next wednesday
[2:52] praise god it's hard to believe it comes
[2:54] so fast but i'm
[2:55] i'm excited to see it come and
[2:57] everybody's working hard there's a
[2:58] flurry activity right at the end and
[3:00] if you find yourself with a little bit
[3:02] of time and no job to do and you want to
[3:04] get involved
[3:05] see brother dean or somebody else and
[3:07] ask hey what what do you need the most
[3:09] and and i'm sure brother dean will sign
[3:11] you up quick
[3:12] for something amen god bless you
[3:17] let's uh read isaiah 46 and verse 9.
[3:26] isaiah 46 and 9 remember the former
[3:28] things of
[3:29] old for i am god and there is none else
[3:32] i am god and there is none like me
[3:35] declaring the
[3:36] end from the beginning and from ancient
[3:38] times the things that are not yet done
[3:40] saying my counsel shall stand and i will
[3:43] do all my pleasure
[3:45] amen it's amazing that god has his own
[3:48] counsel and he's able to declare
[3:50] things from ancient times that have not
[3:52] yet come to pass
[3:53] amen and he has declared it and he
[3:56] declared it to daniel and it was sealed
[3:57] and he told daniel to be sealed
[3:59] he declared it in the thunders and he
[4:00] told john not to ride it but we're
[4:03] we're living in the day that the seals
[4:05] have been broken the thunders have been
[4:06] preached
[4:07] and we're here seeing and hearing those
[4:10] things that were foretold of ancient
[4:11] times
[4:12] that some have not even yet come to pass
[4:15] so we're looking forward to those and
[4:17] we're seeing the day of rapid
[4:18] fulfillment
[4:19] and now what i love about this is
[4:23] we know that his council shall stand
[4:26] and if you have a position in that
[4:28] council and you're part of that council
[4:29] you shall stand
[4:31] his counsel shall stand amen and he says
[4:34] and i will do all my pleasure
[4:37] if your pleasure is his pleasure then
[4:39] those are good words for you
[4:41] amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[4:44] father we thank you lord for this day
[4:46] and
[4:46] as we approach unto you lord we're just
[4:48] so grateful that we can come again
[4:51] noah we're so grateful that we have a
[4:53] place where we can gather together with
[4:55] our brothers and
[4:56] sisters and we can worship you lord and
[4:58] we know you're here because you promised
[5:00] it lord
[5:01] you promised in your word where two or
[5:02] three are gathered in your name you'll
[5:04] be in their midst
[5:05] and here we are and we know you're here
[5:07] also lord
[5:09] while we pray that you'd make yourself
[5:10] known to us by the breaking of your
[5:12] bread lord that you would feed your
[5:13] sheep this morning
[5:15] pray that you would take this vessel of
[5:16] clay lord and by the power of your holy
[5:18] ghost that you would operate a gift
[5:20] that's laying inside to minister your
[5:22] word to your people
[5:24] lord use lips of clay to speak eternal
[5:26] words
[5:27] we ask for these things now as we lord
[5:29] just feed on your word in jesus christ's
[5:31] name we pray
[5:33] amen you can have your seats we'll bring
[5:36] up the powerpoint
[5:39] amen we've we've done quite a bit of
[5:40] review so we're just going to launch in
[5:42] and go
[5:43] go very quickly we're going to talk
[5:45] about the third seal and show that the
[5:47] lamb
[5:48] is in control this is what i think is
[5:50] one of the greatest revelations of this
[5:52] seal
[5:52] is the fact that the lamb is in total
[5:55] control
[5:56] amen let's go to revelations chapter six
[6:01] just refresh ourselves on the seal
[6:04] revelations chapter 6
[6:06] verse 5 and 6.
[6:09] and when he had opened the third seal i
[6:11] heard the third beast say come and see
[6:13] and i beheld and lo
[6:14] a black horse and he that sat on him had
[6:17] a pair of balances in his hand
[6:19] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[6:20] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[6:23] penny
[6:24] three measures of barley for a penny and
[6:26] see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
[6:30] i want to really emphasize here that
[6:32] that there was a voice
[6:34] in the midst of the ford beast that said
[6:37] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[6:38] measures of barley for a penny
[6:40] and see thou hurt not the oil and the
[6:42] wine we're going to
[6:44] take a look at this in just a couple
[6:45] slides real quick i want to show right
[6:48] at the beginning of the third seal i've
[6:49] read the first half of this
[6:51] uh the last two services that there was
[6:53] another part that i wanted to add
[6:55] tonight
[6:55] he said in this great hour that we're
[6:57] now living we see yearly it gets darker
[7:00] and darker to the world
[7:01] and the coming of the lord gets brighter
[7:02] and brighter as he reveals himself
[7:04] in his word and in his manifestation
[7:07] this
[7:07] is a synopsis of the third seal the
[7:10] world is getting darker and darker and
[7:12] darker because there's
[7:13] gross darkness there's a famine of
[7:15] hearing the word of god
[7:16] and then the word of god is not being
[7:19] preached in its purity it's not being
[7:20] preached in its wholeness
[7:21] it's bringing peace together by the
[7:23] minds of men to make it comfortable for
[7:25] those who are living in compromise to
[7:27] stay in compromise
[7:28] it's made the the preaching of the
[7:30] gospel is made to make people
[7:32] comfortable in their pews
[7:33] it is not preached in a way to line
[7:35] people to the word amen
[7:37] because people don't want to line to the
[7:39] word they want to be comfortable and
[7:40] have religion just like cain wanted to
[7:42] have religion amen so now there's a
[7:45] famine in the land of hearing the word
[7:46] of god
[7:47] amen because people just want to do what
[7:49] they want to do
[7:51] and they heap together themselves
[7:52] teachers having itchy ears amen they
[7:54] just want their ears scratched
[7:56] they just want to have a form of
[7:57] religion but deny the power thereof
[8:00] but through the man age anointing amen
[8:03] there was light coming revelation coming
[8:05] amen the oil and the wine was coming and
[8:07] it was getting brighter and brighter
[8:09] and now we're talking about the third
[8:11] seal and the third seal we know
[8:13] brother brenham takes it and shows that
[8:16] how this was the
[8:17] the darkest hour for the word of god but
[8:20] how
[8:20] through a man anointing out coming from
[8:22] luther through wesley and on
[8:23] up it would begin to restore back to the
[8:26] word amen but by the anointing of the
[8:28] wisdom of god
[8:30] would come and he typed it with a man
[8:32] typing the the intellectuals the right
[8:34] understanding the revelation of the word
[8:36] would pour back into the church bringing
[8:38] it out of the dark ages
[8:40] and so he types this back but then he
[8:43] makes a statement that's very
[8:44] interesting
[8:45] this is right in the beginning right in
[8:46] the opening statements in the third seal
[8:49] we have come again tonight lord to
[8:50] attempt this meeting and to pray
[8:53] thee to open to us lord this third seal
[8:56] of this book
[8:57] that it might be known to us that we
[8:58] would know what to do
[9:00] and how to live and how to be better
[9:02] christians
[9:04] so he's not asking for the seal to be
[9:06] open so we understand what happened in
[9:08] the church ages
[9:10] the purpose of the seal being revealed
[9:12] was not to understand what happened in
[9:13] the church ages
[9:15] so but though that we would know what to
[9:17] do and how to live
[9:19] and how to be better christians
[9:23] hallelujah it has to do with the church
[9:26] ages absolutely amen
[9:28] this is a pattern that this is a pattern
[9:30] that patterned itself
[9:31] out through the church ages but brother
[9:33] branham is not asking for just to see
[9:35] the
[9:36] pattern he's asking for the pattern to
[9:38] show
[9:39] us how we should be living today how we
[9:42] should be better christians today
[9:44] by understanding the third seal
[9:48] hallelujah is the black horse was the
[9:52] antichrist was riding on his black horse
[9:54] which is spiritual famine
[9:56] and dark ages amen and people believe
[9:58] that we have come out of the dark ages
[10:00] we most certainly have not come out of
[10:02] the dark ages spiritually speaking
[10:04] the world is steeped where amos put them
[10:07] in a spiritual
[10:08] famine not for bread and water but
[10:10] hearing the word of god
[10:11] amen their minds are darkened to the
[10:13] gospel amen it's never been a
[10:16] darker time for the gospel than it is
[10:18] right now
[10:20] there's churches on every corner amen
[10:22] but it's not the abundance of steeples
[10:24] that you see
[10:25] across the landscape that have anything
[10:27] to do with light all they're doing is
[10:29] sowing more
[10:30] darkness because they perverted the word
[10:32] of god amen the only thing they'll bring
[10:34] light is the pure word of god the
[10:36] perverted word of god will bring
[10:38] more darkness more famine for hearing
[10:41] the word of god
[10:43] hallelujah the scriptures are replete
[10:46] with this the new testament
[10:47] speaks of this amen
[10:50] so it's a dark ages
[10:54] the third seal he said this he was
[10:55] starting writing him in the time of dark
[10:57] ages that's what the dark horse
[10:59] represented
[11:00] the dark ages for it was a time of
[11:01] midnight to the true believers that was
[11:03] left
[11:07] now we see our battle plan we know now
[11:09] as we've been studying this and watching
[11:11] it we're seeing the devil's tactics
[11:13] we're understanding
[11:14] how he operates and brother branham said
[11:16] if you want to if you want to
[11:17] fight somebody in a war you need to
[11:19] understand your enemy and understand his
[11:21] tactics so you know how to fight against
[11:23] him
[11:23] and that's what the seals are doing is
[11:25] it's revealing the enemy
[11:27] exposing his tactics so now we
[11:29] understand what's happening in our lives
[11:31] we know why something's coming against
[11:34] me this way and why
[11:35] it's happening this way because that's
[11:37] the way he operates
[11:38] he's laid down a pattern and he will
[11:40] always operate by that pattern
[11:42] the pattern's not changing
[11:47] then he sends out a competing power the
[11:50] power of the man
[11:52] now the third beast that went out from
[11:53] the devil was this black horse now the
[11:55] third beast that went out power from god
[11:57] to combat him
[11:59] to combat the powers of the black horse
[12:00] was a man cunning smart with the wisdom
[12:03] of god
[12:04] and we've we know too that he had oil
[12:06] and wine oils the holy spirit wine is
[12:08] the stimulation of revelation
[12:10] and so now this wisdom of god this
[12:12] intellectuals that come from god
[12:14] is spiritual understanding by revelation
[12:18] not spirit spiritual understanding by
[12:20] education
[12:22] spiritual understanding by revelation
[12:26] we could give you a message quiz book
[12:28] and sit down and train you until you
[12:30] could answer all the questions on the
[12:31] message quiz book
[12:33] but that doesn't mean that you've
[12:35] received revelation and actually know in
[12:37] your heart
[12:38] what all this means amen doesn't mean
[12:40] that you've ever met jesus christ
[12:41] personally to you but what it means is
[12:44] that you're able to recite
[12:45] back what you've heard in your ears and
[12:47] comprehended in your mind
[12:49] that's not what's going to get it
[12:50] there's got to be a spiritual revelation
[12:52] that takes place
[12:55] amen and that's what this man that's
[12:57] what this man
[12:58] age anointing amen represents
[13:02] praise the lord the fourth seal the word
[13:05] itself
[13:06] is spirit it's spirit in word
[13:09] form then you see when it's quickened or
[13:12] brought to life
[13:12] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[13:18] acts
[13:20] but now you start bringing the word now
[13:22] that's the thing that
[13:24] actually brings life is the word
[13:28] and that brings the joy of stimulation
[13:30] of new wine
[13:31] and that's what it was on pentecost when
[13:34] the word
[13:35] was vindicated now you see what what was
[13:38] it what was happening at pentecost
[13:40] is they already had received promises
[13:42] jesus had already unlocked their
[13:44] understanding by the scriptures amen but
[13:46] they were waiting for a promise to be
[13:48] fulfilled
[13:49] amen and when they saw that promised
[13:51] word come into manifestation
[13:53] they got so stimulated they were drunk
[13:55] on new wine and spilled out into the
[13:57] street
[13:58] so excited they just had to tell
[14:00] somebody about it
[14:02] and that's what happened at pentecost it
[14:04] was the stimulation of revelation when
[14:06] they saw the word
[14:07] coming to pass in their day they got
[14:10] excited about it
[14:12] amen that's why if you don't see the
[14:14] manifestation of the word in your day
[14:15] you're not going to be very excited amen
[14:17] you'll sit in church and there won't be
[14:19] a whole lot of hallelujahs or amen
[14:21] just kind of stoic sitting there
[14:23] rehearsing god sent a prophet god sent a
[14:25] prophet god sent a prophet god sent a
[14:27] prophet
[14:27] god sent a prophet but what did the
[14:29] prophet say and what was the purpose of
[14:30] his ministry
[14:32] amen we live in a day where we know god
[14:34] sent a prophet but god also took a
[14:36] prophet off the scene
[14:37] and what that prophet left the words
[14:39] that he brought was more important than
[14:41] himself
[14:43] what he introduced was more important
[14:45] than the person himself
[14:47] and now we have to be united not with
[14:49] malachi 4
[14:50] but we have to be united with the mighty
[14:52] angel that came down in revelations 10.
[14:56] it's not the seventh angel that we unite
[14:58] to amen it's the mighty angel that we
[15:00] unite to
[15:01] and then catch those revelations as they
[15:03] peel themselves open in our day
[15:05] and then you'll get stimulation with new
[15:08] wine
[15:09] and that's why when when we're just
[15:11] rehearsing over and over what god did
[15:13] what god did what god did
[15:15] it's hard to keep the youth excited amen
[15:17] it's hard to keep him from running out
[15:19] for movies and videos and some other
[15:20] entertainment it's hard to keep the
[15:22] families together
[15:23] it's hard to keep dad sitting next to
[15:25] mom because there's nothing to be
[15:26] excited about i've heard this before
[15:28] we're talking about what god did 50
[15:30] years ago
[15:31] and every service is what god did 50
[15:33] years ago but i tell you if you want to
[15:35] get a believer excited you show them in
[15:36] the word what god's doing today
[15:39] right now then they'll spill out of the
[15:41] upper room and have to go
[15:43] tell somebody about it hallelujah
[15:48] stimulation by revelation drinking new
[15:50] wine
[15:53] hallelujah
[16:00] praise the lord
[16:05] now just as that church is kind of
[16:07] antichrist church progresses
[16:09] she's showing how the antichrist church
[16:12] progresses from white horse
[16:14] to red horse to black horse and then the
[16:16] pale horse
[16:18] he says just as he progresses so has the
[16:20] bride come along
[16:22] with different things through
[16:23] justification sanctification
[16:25] baptism of the holy ghost just moving
[16:27] right on see
[16:28] just like that only they've taken the
[16:30] revival first and the church is taking
[16:33] it the last there's a principle here
[16:36] that we'll hopefully get into in the
[16:38] next few weeks i don't have time
[16:40] to get into it today but we see that
[16:42] this cycle repeats itself
[16:44] through the through the church ages we
[16:45] always see whatever time
[16:47] god lays down a pattern that pattern
[16:49] you'll find it repeating over and over
[16:51] and over again
[16:52] and so the church has progressed through
[16:56] the false church through white horse red
[16:58] horse black horse
[16:59] and you'll find that that rolls right on
[17:01] all the time
[17:02] so you get a new false doctrine that'll
[17:05] start it'll come out in innocency under
[17:07] white horse
[17:08] can't harm anybody it's just a saying
[17:10] amen it's just a way of fellowshipping
[17:12] together
[17:13] and then it'll move the red horse and
[17:14] start division amongst brethren and
[17:16] start war
[17:16] and then it'll go to black horse and
[17:18] leave the people in spiritual famine
[17:20] and it'll start to measure out the word
[17:22] amen and bring control
[17:24] back to the mother church it happens
[17:26] every time the same way
[17:28] and so god is showing that there's a
[17:30] pattern there but there's another
[17:32] god bless you isabella it's good to see
[17:33] you here today
[17:35] hallelujah i i just happened to see you
[17:38] there
[17:39] my wife sometimes asked me why don't i
[17:41] don't say hi to people when i see him i
[17:43] say because i'm so lost in space
[17:45] when i get up here if i if i see you
[17:47] half the time i don't even know what
[17:48] your name is
[17:50] praise the lord so we see there's a
[17:53] pattern and the church went first and
[17:55] then god come down through
[17:57] and he said the pentecostal message was
[17:59] the last message
[18:00] which justification sanctification the
[18:02] baptism of holy ghost
[18:03] the last three messages the last three
[18:05] church ages formed the complete birth
[18:08] so he's showing the birth of the church
[18:10] not not just the individual but those
[18:12] three church ages
[18:13] brought the church all the way back into
[18:15] birth amen so they could unite with the
[18:17] headship
[18:20] and so we see this pattern that the lion
[18:24] is justification amen because you hear
[18:27] the word
[18:28] what happens when you first hear the
[18:29] word you run out and you're roaring and
[18:31] roaring and roaring like a lion amen
[18:34] and and you catch the word and it makes
[18:36] you bold and it makes you independent
[18:39] and oh praise the lord it's a wonderful
[18:41] thing but then
[18:43] you realize you've got to eat the book
[18:45] amen and the book becomes bitter in your
[18:47] belly
[18:48] because it's not just talking now
[18:49] there's a life that has to be lived amen
[18:52] you can come out excited about what you
[18:53] hear and go talking about it
[18:55] but there has to come where the rubber
[18:56] meets the road that this word has to
[18:58] translate into a life
[19:00] lived and so then we have to come into
[19:02] sanctification which is the ox anointing
[19:04] which is you bear under the burden of
[19:06] the word and you sacrifice your life
[19:10] hallelujah but then you come
[19:14] to a greater revelation amen come to a
[19:16] new birth experience
[19:18] where it's revealed to you amen
[19:22] brother branham says in christ is the
[19:23] mystery of god revealed what is the new
[19:25] birth then
[19:26] well brother branham what is the new
[19:28] birth it is the revelation of jesus
[19:31] christ
[19:31] personally to you now let me be clear
[19:35] it is not the revelation of who he was
[19:40] it's the revelation of who he is
[19:44] there's a ton of people who can tell you
[19:46] who he was but how many people know who
[19:49] he
[19:49] is today and we know that he is the word
[19:52] and he said
[19:53] his he is the word i mean the word was
[19:55] with god the word was god
[19:57] we know the word was made flesh and
[19:59] dwelt among us and when that flesh
[20:01] died and resurrected and went he never
[20:03] stopped being the word he is still the
[20:04] word he was always the word that came
[20:06] out from god
[20:07] he always will be the word and he says
[20:09] the word that i speak unto you they are
[20:11] spirit and they are life
[20:15] if people want to get in the spirit and
[20:17] they want to have a spiritual
[20:18] show and a spiritual service and they
[20:20] want to feel the spirit of god and
[20:22] jam up the music and play and dance
[20:24] around a bit but if you don't have word
[20:27] you don't have
[20:28] spirits because my word
[20:31] is spirit and life you can get a spirit
[20:34] you can get a spiritual anointing
[20:36] on your on your spirit and you can get
[20:39] excited about that
[20:40] but that that that could be a false
[20:42] spirit altogether amen
[20:45] amen because without the word you don't
[20:48] have the right spirit
[20:49] without the word you don't have jesus
[20:52] christ
[20:54] so what is the new birth it's the
[20:55] revelation of jesus christ today
[20:58] manifesting his word who he is right now
[21:01] at this moment
[21:02] amen personally revealed to you not you
[21:06] joined a church you shook hand you'd
[21:07] done something different you said a
[21:09] creed you promised to live by a coat of
[21:10] rules
[21:11] but christ the bible he is the word that
[21:14] was revealed to you and no matter what
[21:16] anybody says
[21:17] what takes place it's christ pastor
[21:20] priest whatever it might be
[21:21] it's christ in you that is the
[21:23] revelation the church was built upon
[21:28] it says now same same message now paul
[21:31] knew him by revelation
[21:32] that's how we know him today is the only
[21:35] is
[21:36] only the only way you could know him not
[21:38] say i'm a methodist that means nothing
[21:40] i'm a baptist that means nothing i'm a
[21:42] catholic that means nothing i go to a
[21:43] message church that means
[21:45] nothing amen that's no more than just
[21:48] another form of worship
[21:50] amen if that's the deeper all the deeper
[21:52] it goes it don't mean nothing
[21:54] amen but by revelation that god has
[21:57] revealed
[21:58] the word to you
[22:01] he is the word and the word how you know
[22:04] it's revealed
[22:06] it lives itself and expresses itself
[22:09] through you hallelujah
[22:15] super sign the solar sun
[22:18] up there s-u-n has control of all botany
[22:21] life
[22:22] when a seed is laying there and that sun
[22:24] strikes it it'll come to life
[22:26] yes sir and the s-o-n of god
[22:29] is the controller of all eternal life
[22:31] and you've got a seed of life
[22:33] in you brother and when the s-o-n
[22:36] strikes there and shows you what he
[22:38] is it comes to life there is no way of
[22:41] keeping it from it
[22:44] hallelujah praise the lord
[22:48] i want to read a little bit out of the
[22:50] fourth seal if you've brought your
[22:52] book i'm going to read out of paragraph
[22:54] 76 and the fourth seal
[22:58] says yes you you can accept it by faith
[23:01] you have to accept christ by faith
[23:03] that's exactly right and you accept the
[23:04] holy spirit by faith
[23:06] but then let the holy spirit come and
[23:08] give the circumcision as a witness
[23:10] that he's accepted your faith you see
[23:12] then so abraham believed god and it was
[23:14] reputed to him for righteousness
[23:16] now i i have to stop here and i just
[23:19] pray for me folks because
[23:21] we could preach four or five hours today
[23:24] amen
[23:24] and if you all leave in one of your
[23:26] stays i'll still feed whatever sheep
[23:28] stay behind
[23:31] so so it says abraham
[23:35] believed god and it was imputed unto him
[23:37] for righteousness
[23:38] so if abraham's imputation of
[23:41] righteousness was based on what he
[23:43] believed
[23:44] what was he believing on was he
[23:46] believing on something that
[23:48] abel had said or something that adam had
[23:50] said but or was he believing on a fresh
[23:53] revelation from god
[23:55] was he believing old word or was he
[23:57] believing the word
[23:58] that was manifest for his day see there
[24:00] was a promise that came to
[24:02] abraham for abraham for the day abraham
[24:05] lived in
[24:06] and it didn't matter how much he
[24:08] believed what adam had said or what
[24:09] abel had said or what enoch had said
[24:12] none of that at this point matters
[24:13] doesn't matter if he believed what noah
[24:15] had said and done it doesn't matter at
[24:17] this
[24:18] point all that matters for the
[24:19] imputation of righteousness
[24:21] is that he believes god today
[24:25] god could come to him and say you're
[24:26] going to have a sign and he says no no
[24:28] no no no
[24:29] that's not happening this day i'm
[24:30] building an ark because that's the last
[24:32] word that i saw
[24:33] that's in my bible i'm just going to do
[24:35] what's in my bible and nothing else
[24:39] he would have never had the imputation
[24:41] of righteousness
[24:42] because imputation of righteousness is
[24:44] based on believing
[24:46] god hallelujah
[24:50] and you can't it doesn't do you any good
[24:52] to believe what was in the past
[24:54] amen we should believe what's in the
[24:56] past but anybody can believe what's in
[24:58] the past
[24:59] amen even jesus he's looking at the
[25:01] pharisees and he's saying
[25:02] he's saying your fathers killed these
[25:05] prophets
[25:06] and now you're out there recognizing
[25:08] those prophets and whitewashing their
[25:10] tombs
[25:10] what good is it going to do you amen it
[25:13] didn't do your father's any good because
[25:15] they rejected
[25:15] what good is it doing you polishing that
[25:18] because everything that those prophets
[25:19] dead is now standing in front of you in
[25:21] a body of flesh
[25:22] and you're rejecting it you're doing the
[25:24] same thing your fathers have done
[25:25] it doesn't do one ounce of good to
[25:27] recognize the past
[25:29] amen even the pharisees who were
[25:30] standing jesus in the face and calling
[25:32] him beelzebub
[25:33] they had no problem with isaiah no
[25:36] problem with ezekiel
[25:37] no problem with jeremiah they had the
[25:39] old testament and they believed every
[25:41] word of it
[25:42] so far amen so far as they knew but when
[25:45] the word itself that all that old
[25:46] testament come into flesh and was
[25:48] standing there living in front of them
[25:50] they rejected it thereby cutting them
[25:53] off from
[25:53] any any resource any ability or any
[25:56] effect of that word
[25:58] it now meant nothing to them
[26:02] friends we stand in the same place today
[26:06] we can believe in prophets and polish
[26:08] their tombs and visit jeffersonville all
[26:10] we want
[26:10] but what good is that going to do if we
[26:12] deny jesus christ manifest in the
[26:14] formation of the bride today
[26:17] the full word manifestation and a many
[26:20] membered bride
[26:21] if we're rejecting that it doesn't
[26:22] matter if you get your picture taken
[26:24] beside the tombstone it won't do you any
[26:26] good
[26:27] it won't do any more than it did for the
[26:29] pharisees in that day
[26:33] if you had believed moses
[26:37] you would receive me if you had believed
[26:40] in what the prophet told us
[26:42] you would receive the manifestation of
[26:43] the word for this hour
[26:48] so abraham believed god and it was
[26:50] imputed to him for righteousness we're
[26:52] back in the fourth seal
[26:54] but god gave him the sign of
[26:56] circumcision as a confirmation he'd
[26:58] accepted his faith
[26:59] so that's the same thing we must do we
[27:01] must wait
[27:02] on the holy spirit till it's done
[27:05] something
[27:06] i want you to get this so much
[27:10] confusion on the holy spirit baptism
[27:12] because we take a pentecostal idea
[27:15] amen and we've got to actually
[27:17] understand what the prophet is teaching
[27:19] us about the baptism of the holy ghost
[27:21] amen abraham received it in a type of
[27:24] circumcision
[27:25] and he didn't receive it and dancing and
[27:27] shouting and speaking in tongues
[27:29] he received it in a sign of separation
[27:31] of cutting off
[27:32] amen and a separating out we must wait
[27:36] on the holy spirit until it's done
[27:37] something
[27:38] not necessary not necessarily because we
[27:41] spoke in tongues
[27:42] not because we have danced or we got
[27:43] emotional we shouted
[27:45] until we were changed
[27:49] until something actually happened i
[27:52] don't care what form it comes in
[27:54] just so it happened that's the main
[27:56] thing
[27:58] it says though i speak with the tongue
[28:00] of men and angels and have not charity
[28:02] it profit me nothing see though i could
[28:04] do it so
[28:05] those things doesn't mean that you have
[28:07] the holy spirit
[28:08] but when he the person the immortal
[28:11] spirit of christ
[28:12] comes becomes your personal savior and
[28:15] changes you
[28:17] and throws your views right straight
[28:19] into calvary to this word
[28:21] something's happened yes sir
[28:24] something has happened no one will have
[28:26] to tell you about it you'll know it when
[28:28] it happens
[28:29] and the new wine when it brings
[28:31] revelation then it's revealed and that's
[28:33] the way it was
[28:34] at pentecost so he's not saying
[28:37] see brother branham said you must
[28:39] receive it by experience
[28:42] right but then you have to yourself what
[28:44] experience
[28:45] i mean is it a tingling sensation a
[28:47] shiver up my spine
[28:49] will i speak in tongues do i have to do
[28:50] one of 10 different things i mean could
[28:52] it be 10 different emotional outbursts
[28:54] could it be 10 different forms of things
[28:56] do i have to do one of them
[28:57] you don't have to do any of them it can
[28:59] come without any sensation whatsoever
[29:02] the experience does not mean it's
[29:04] sensation the experience means you've
[29:06] gone through the experience of a changed
[29:08] life
[29:09] the baptism of the holy ghost is an
[29:11] experience where you were going one way
[29:13] living one way
[29:14] and then god revealed himself to you and
[29:16] opened up to you the word for this
[29:18] hour and it actually changed you and you
[29:21] started going another way
[29:22] you started thinking different feeling
[29:24] different acting different
[29:26] there was an actual change in your life
[29:29] you you know sometimes young people grow
[29:32] up in the message and they have
[29:33] questions about
[29:34] the baptism of the holy ghost because
[29:36] you know what i've always believed this
[29:38] and
[29:38] and i've always lived in a in a holy
[29:40] manner and i've always
[29:41] been under mom and dad's rule and i've
[29:43] never went wild drinking smoking cussing
[29:45] swearing
[29:46] i mean none of these things but but see
[29:48] it still has to come a change
[29:50] amen where all of a sudden it's not mom
[29:52] and dad's faith anymore
[29:54] i'm not here because of my friends
[29:55] anymore it's not a social religion for
[29:57] me anymore it's not the place i've
[29:59] always been the place i'm comfortable
[30:01] but now there's a desire for it to be
[30:03] personal to me
[30:04] to now if the whole church disbands
[30:07] something's changed in me
[30:08] now i want the word for me now i don't
[30:12] want it to listen to woman mom and dad
[30:14] said i don't want it to be a good boy
[30:15] i don't want it to be in good standing
[30:17] in the church i want that word for me
[30:22] change something changed and change your
[30:24] desires and now
[30:25] you don't want to be just floating along
[30:27] just drifting along just part of a
[30:29] church and go back out and do whatever
[30:31] you wanted before
[30:32] but it changed your actual desires you
[30:34] don't want to do anything else
[30:36] but what god wants you to do
[30:39] doesn't mean you've come to sin as
[30:40] perfection you'll mess up all the time
[30:42] that's not a problem for god god's
[30:44] already got an atonement laying there
[30:46] for that
[30:46] but your desire is not to mess up your
[30:48] desire is to be right
[30:50] but in trying to do right going along
[30:52] living in a fallen cursed body
[30:54] in a cursed world you stumble and fall
[30:56] brother branham said the devil's got
[30:58] traps laid for you and you're going to
[31:00] fall into them
[31:02] it's going to happen but that's what the
[31:04] atonement's for
[31:05] friends but there's got to be a an
[31:08] experience
[31:09] of a change something in you
[31:13] has to change that's the experience
[31:17] of the baptism of the holy ghost not a
[31:19] reformation
[31:20] not i'll do better next time not
[31:24] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not
[31:25] gonna be bad anymore now i'm gonna be
[31:27] good
[31:27] that's not it friends it's a personal
[31:30] encounter with jesus christ
[31:32] and an awakening in the soul that
[31:34] actually changes you
[31:37] let's go on and read in the in the
[31:39] fourth seal
[31:40] now look at the promise of the last days
[31:42] and here we see it vindicated right
[31:44] before us
[31:45] the present coming of the holy spirit
[31:47] and works that he was supposed to do
[31:49] and we find it right among us see oh my
[31:52] now how could we hear something takes
[31:54] place i tell you friend
[31:55] when the real true sincere predestinated
[31:58] believer
[31:59] when that light strikes upon that seed
[32:01] something bursts forth to a new life
[32:05] that little woman at the well when those
[32:07] scholar priests had said well that's the
[32:09] devil
[32:09] he's a fortune teller he he is telling
[32:12] those people their fortune he's a devil
[32:14] but when that little woman with that
[32:16] predestinated seed
[32:17] amen here the priests they see the
[32:20] manifestation of the word for their hour
[32:22] and they call it the devil and here
[32:24] there's a woman who's living in a
[32:26] terrible life and a terrible
[32:28] condition but yet there's something
[32:30] inside of her
[32:31] that was there before the foundation of
[32:32] the world she didn't even know it was
[32:34] there she couldn't have explained
[32:36] anything about it
[32:37] but when she came in contact with jesus
[32:39] christ it came to life
[32:42] and it wasn't because she rubbed against
[32:44] him amen when the crowded streets and
[32:46] they were jostling about they rubbed
[32:47] against him
[32:48] the the the the evil wicked soldiers who
[32:51] beat him they punched him in the face
[32:52] and ripped his beard out
[32:53] and they touched him all over the place
[32:55] that didn't do them any good
[32:57] amen but it was when it was when he
[32:59] began to reveal
[33:01] something to her it awakened the seed
[33:03] inside
[33:05] it's not just touching jesus amen it's
[33:07] not just coming in contact it's a
[33:09] revelation
[33:10] and a revelation is based on
[33:13] understanding
[33:14] something about the word
[33:17] hallelujah
[33:20] further down i'll skip down just a
[33:22] little further and says in the day that
[33:24] we're living in why it should bring joy
[33:26] unspeakable and full of glory
[33:28] that little old woman as soon as that
[33:30] struck her my the seed burst forth
[33:34] hallelujah further down in the fourth
[33:38] seal he says now remember
[33:39] the bible says it in the last day now i
[33:42] want you to watch real close brother
[33:43] brother branham's going to tell a story
[33:46] amen and he's he's talking about the
[33:48] seed coming to life he's talking about
[33:50] the woman at the well and the pharisees
[33:52] rejecting but her receiving
[33:54] and he's continuing that same thought
[33:56] and so don't lose it because you're
[33:57] going to jump to something and jump
[33:59] back and i'll point it out to you but i
[34:00] want you to catch it
[34:02] now remember the bible says that in the
[34:04] last day that this antichrist would
[34:05] deceive the whole world
[34:07] there'd only be a small number whose
[34:08] names were put on the lamb's book of
[34:10] life
[34:10] before the foundation of the world and
[34:12] when that true vindication of the
[34:14] revealed truth of god's word strikes
[34:16] that heart
[34:17] he will strike the water and out yander
[34:19] with the holy ghost
[34:20] just as hard as he can and you can't
[34:22] stop him from doing it because the new
[34:24] life
[34:24] work worked forth and i was talking to a
[34:28] person not long ago
[34:29] he was trying to discuss with me and
[34:31] saying aren't you ashamed to say that
[34:33] god created the heavens and the earth
[34:35] three
[34:35] in six days now what in the world is he
[34:37] saying
[34:38] he's talking about when the light when
[34:41] the truth of god's word strikes that
[34:42] heart he'll strike the water and out
[34:44] yonder
[34:44] and the holy ghost just as sure as you
[34:47] can you can't stop him from doing it
[34:48] because the new life's working
[34:50] and then he says somebody asked me
[34:51] aren't i ashamed to say that the world
[34:53] was created in six days
[34:56] pay close attention he's going back to
[34:57] genesis back to creation
[35:00] he's continuing the same thought he's
[35:02] not changing his mind
[35:03] i said that's what the bible said he
[35:06] said well we've got evidence and can
[35:08] prove that the world is millions of
[35:09] years old
[35:10] i said that didn't have anything to do
[35:12] with it in genesis 1 1 it said
[35:14] in the beginning god created heavens and
[35:15] earth period see that's
[35:17] all now the world without form and void
[35:20] and i said
[35:20] i believe every seed was laying right
[35:24] there
[35:24] from some other civilization
[35:26] civilization
[35:27] or something and as soon as the water
[35:30] lifted off and the light struck it
[35:32] up come the trees and everything
[35:36] now he's talking about the new birth
[35:38] he's talking about the
[35:39] the revealed word coming to life then he
[35:42] goes
[35:43] to somebody questioning him about
[35:44] believing genesis and how could these
[35:46] things be when the world's millions of
[35:48] years old
[35:48] and he says that's true it is millions
[35:50] of years old but we find out in genesis
[35:52] 1 2
[35:53] that it's covered with water and he said
[35:55] underneath there
[35:56] there's seeds laying there from another
[35:59] civilization
[36:00] or something and when the water parts
[36:03] and the light strikes it
[36:04] it comes to life now listen the same
[36:08] thing with the human being
[36:10] it's a type the mist is moved away
[36:14] and the revealed truth to the real seed
[36:17] laying there
[36:18] still germatized and the light of the
[36:21] gospel can strike it by true a
[36:22] vindication of the word
[36:24] it'll live it's got life in it
[36:28] outside of that it can't live it hasn't
[36:30] got no life in it
[36:32] them names were put on the lamb's book
[36:34] of life before the foundation of the
[36:36] world
[36:36] will come forth just as certain as
[36:39] anything
[36:41] now you've got to catch the significance
[36:44] of what he's saying here friends
[36:46] your new birth has nothing to do with
[36:48] your crying out
[36:50] your new birth has nothing to do with
[36:52] your desperate pleading and fastings and
[36:54] all of that
[36:54] your new birth has everything to do with
[36:57] the seed gene of god
[36:58] an eternal predestinated seed laying in
[37:00] your soul
[37:01] that when the mist is moved away and the
[37:03] light strikes that seed
[37:05] it comes to life that's the new birth
[37:07] friends
[37:08] it may come with all kinds of sensations
[37:10] it may come with no sensations
[37:12] but that's exactly what the new birth is
[37:15] the new birth is that portion of god
[37:17] that he portioned out for this day
[37:19] that winds up in your body of flesh your
[37:21] clump of dirt
[37:22] that light laying there dormant amen
[37:24] it's germatized
[37:26] it's got life inside of it already amen
[37:31] it's just waiting for something it's
[37:34] waiting for the conditions to get right
[37:36] when god would move back the mist the
[37:38] waters from over your life and the part
[37:40] the darkness
[37:41] and let the word amend that eternal word
[37:43] of the
[37:44] s-o-n strike that seed and it'll come to
[37:47] life because it's already a dermatitis
[37:49] seed
[37:50] and it's already been planted in your
[37:51] dirt that is the new birth
[37:55] that's why we don't talk people into the
[37:57] new birth we don't beat them on the back
[37:58] of the altar for hours
[38:00] amen we don't have all-night prayer
[38:01] meetings for the new birth the new birth
[38:03] comes by revelation of the word of this
[38:05] hour and when that conditions are right
[38:08] when god moves back all the midst of
[38:10] your wrong thinking
[38:11] all the midst of your own ideas and he
[38:13] brings to light
[38:14] the true word for this hour and hits
[38:16] that seed it will come to life
[38:20] you may have sat in church all of your
[38:22] life and you wonder why i didn't receive
[38:24] the baptism holy ghost why i wasn't born
[38:26] again when i was 8
[38:27] 10 12 20 25 because the conditions
[38:30] weren't right yet
[38:31] god first has to get the conditions
[38:33] right he's got to move the water aside
[38:36] the mist from your life the fogginess
[38:38] and your thinking and the
[38:40] misunderstandings of the message
[38:42] the misunderstanding of your life move
[38:44] it aside
[38:45] and then then he'll let the revealed
[38:47] word of the hour hit that seed
[38:50] and it will come to life the new birth
[38:54] isn't speaking in tongues this is why
[38:57] brother branham could stand against
[38:59] the the whole pentecostal world in his
[39:01] day he knew exactly what the new birth
[39:03] was
[39:04] it's not speaking in tongues it's not
[39:06] dancing and shouting it is when that
[39:08] life that's laying there
[39:09] quickens and springs forth
[39:13] hallelujah
[39:16] he says in the third seal paragraph 236
[39:20] what was it the light struck that seed
[39:23] that had been laying there
[39:24] that was spoke by god
[39:28] the seed was on the earth when god moved
[39:30] the water away and the sun hit it it
[39:32] come up that's right
[39:33] that's all it needed was sun it needed
[39:35] light and when the holy spirit in him
[39:38] moved away her past life and showed it
[39:40] her
[39:40] that light struck it and she said sir i
[39:43] perceive you're a prophet
[39:45] she said now i know that when messiah
[39:47] comes that's what he's going to be and
[39:49] we ain't had a prophet for hundreds of
[39:51] years
[39:51] we have never had a true prophet for
[39:53] hundreds of years and she said
[39:55] you tell me about my husband and told me
[39:57] how many i've had and so forth
[39:59] i don't understand this when messiah
[40:01] cometh well he's going to do that but
[40:03] who are you he said i am he
[40:06] that was it a harlem what was it a
[40:09] personal revelation of jesus christ
[40:12] she saw the word she saw what it was
[40:14] able to do
[40:15] and she said but who are you amen and he
[40:18] says
[40:19] she said are you the messiah she says i
[40:20] am he what did she receive
[40:22] a personal revelation of jesus christ in
[40:25] her day
[40:28] how come the pharisees couldn't receive
[40:30] that there was no seed in there
[40:33] but this little woman living in an
[40:35] adulterous condition there was a seed of
[40:37] life laying in there
[40:38] and when that light hit it oh it begins
[40:40] to quiver under the revelation
[40:42] and the mist is moving back and it's
[40:44] getting it's get the fog is lifting and
[40:46] all of a sudden
[40:47] the words are reminding her of her
[40:49] former life the words are reminding her
[40:51] of a previous civilization
[40:52] remember friends brother branham said
[40:54] those seeds were laying there
[40:55] from a previous civilization hallelujah
[40:58] you have come that seed gene of god
[41:01] inside of you
[41:02] has come from a previous civilization
[41:05] and it's
[41:06] laying here dormant in the earth waiting
[41:08] for the condition to get right
[41:10] and when the condition gets right it
[41:11] comes to life amen
[41:13] and begins to express the former life
[41:16] not the current life the former life
[41:20] that tree that was laying there in
[41:21] genesis 1 1 amen and 1
[41:23] 2 when covered over there's a palm tree
[41:26] laying under there the seed's been
[41:27] germatized
[41:28] it's in the ground it's laying there
[41:30] when the conditions are right
[41:31] it'll come up the same thing it was
[41:33] before
[41:36] it came from a palm tree it's got to be
[41:39] a palm tree
[41:40] it's got to express a palm tree and it's
[41:43] got to give palm tree life amen
[41:45] you have come from god as a seed from
[41:47] god come and planted in this earth
[41:49] and when you come forth you have to come
[41:51] forth as a son of god
[41:53] as an amateur god in the image of god
[41:55] giving forth the seed of god
[41:59] i love how the prophet can take
[42:00] something so simple
[42:02] and explain your whole life
[42:06] hallelujah jesus was speaking to her
[42:09] words from another civilization
[42:12] and it was moving back the mist
[42:16] he said he said that he said i am he
[42:20] that was it a harlot and the priest
[42:22] looked around and said well
[42:23] they'd have to answer to their
[42:24] congregation said don't fool with that
[42:26] fella
[42:27] he's possessed with the devil now that's
[42:29] the difference that's the
[42:30] the same thing today same thing today
[42:35] it's just exactly yep yes sir she knew
[42:37] it because the light struck it
[42:39] them fishermen woodsmen farmers tax
[42:42] collectors harlots
[42:43] they seen in him what the simple
[42:44] scripture said he would do
[42:46] and the pharisees couldn't see because
[42:48] of their tradition
[42:50] they couldn't see because they're
[42:51] traditions but the prostitute the
[42:53] farmers and all them
[42:54] they saw it all that was predestinated
[42:57] when the doubts rolled away
[42:59] the seed went to growing
[43:02] hallelujah can i read a little more
[43:06] these are the kind of quotes that get me
[43:07] stimulated this is like drinking new
[43:10] wine friends
[43:13] questions and answers on the seals now
[43:15] remember jesus come to be a witness as a
[43:17] savior of the world
[43:18] is that right why there was just people
[43:21] after people after people after races
[43:23] after people that never even know
[43:25] nothing about it it went right on just
[43:27] like the world know nothing about it but
[43:29] all the time that was going on in the
[43:32] world see
[43:33] why didn't he let them know he came and
[43:36] the ones that was predestinated to
[43:38] eternal life was the ones that received
[43:40] him
[43:41] it had been no good to say anything to
[43:43] the rest of them because he could not
[43:45] have redeemed them
[43:46] because they wasn't even redeemable
[43:50] say that again it had been no good to
[43:53] say
[43:53] anything to the rest of them because he
[43:56] could not have redeemed them
[43:58] because they wasn't even redeemable
[44:02] why the only way you could be redeemable
[44:04] is to be bought back and brought back to
[44:06] a former condition
[44:08] if their former condition wasn't in god
[44:09] they're not redeemable
[44:11] and if your former condition is not in
[44:13] god you're not redeemable
[44:15] that doesn't mean you can't be saved
[44:16] that the white thunder doesn't mean you
[44:17] can't enter into eternal life
[44:19] but the only thing being redeemed is the
[44:21] seed that came from god
[44:23] his redeeming back to himself so he
[44:26] didn't he doesn't have an obligation
[44:28] amen get this jesus christ does not have
[44:31] an obligation amen
[44:32] to to make sure that every human being
[44:34] that ever walked on the face of the
[44:36] earth here's the gospel message
[44:39] he's not obligated to that he's already
[44:41] put it in the stars
[44:42] he's already put it in the pyramid he's
[44:44] already showed it in his nature amen
[44:46] if people will just live true to what
[44:48] they see there can be mercy extended to
[44:51] them amen because he's given enough of
[44:53] himself
[44:53] enough of his word for them to line up
[44:55] to it but he's not
[44:57] obligated to give his secrets amen to
[44:59] them he only gives his secrets to the
[45:01] bride
[45:02] he only gives the secrets to that which
[45:04] is redeemable and by the secrets he
[45:06] redeems them back
[45:10] he draws them back into redemption which
[45:12] he paid for with his blood
[45:13] but he pulls them back by revealing the
[45:16] secrets
[45:18] nobody else can get the secrets friends
[45:22] the mysteries are still mysteries
[45:25] they're not believable they're fairy
[45:26] tales they're odd stories to most people
[45:29] but to you and i when we begin to hear
[45:32] what other people call fairy tales or
[45:34] false doctrine or
[45:36] doctrines of devils when we begin to
[45:37] hear that something inside began to
[45:39] quiver and to shake
[45:41] because there was words from another
[45:43] civilization
[45:44] that was words from my former life that
[45:46] was words from my
[45:48] origin because i come from god i go back
[45:50] to god when i hear the word of god it
[45:52] reminds me of where i came from
[45:54] like you sitting here this morning when
[45:56] you hear the pure unadulterated word of
[45:58] god
[45:59] something inside just gets stimulated
[46:01] all over again
[46:02] why because it's speaking of that other
[46:04] civilization
[46:05] it's speaking of your origin
[46:07] [Applause]
[46:09] something in you remembers not your
[46:12] brain
[46:13] amen not your human but the seed
[46:15] remembers amen and when it hears the
[46:17] word of god and comes contact with the
[46:19] living word
[46:20] it springs to life again friends
[46:23] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:28] where was i reading
[46:32] amen yeah there's people after people
[46:35] that know nothing about him
[46:37] there wasn't even redeemable why was it
[46:39] when these priests stood there
[46:41] he had to come to the spot because the
[46:42] predestinated was plotted out in there
[46:44] all around so he had to preach to them
[46:47] as a group
[46:48] amen see he's casting the net again he
[46:50] has to preach as a group because the
[46:52] predestinated is plotted out in there
[46:54] in israel so he's got to throw the net
[46:56] amen but it's not for some it's only for
[46:58] a few
[47:02] hallelujah he said no man can come to me
[47:03] unless my father draws him
[47:07] and the great scholars that should have
[47:09] known him said this man is beelzebub
[47:11] we'll not have this man rule over us and
[47:13] so forth will not
[47:15] do it but a little old prostitute with a
[47:17] life in her
[47:18] get this with a life in her this is
[47:21] before her new birth
[47:24] this is before she was born again there
[47:27] was a life inside of her
[47:28] because if you've got eternal life when
[47:30] did you get it
[47:33] because if you ever got it it's not
[47:36] eternal
[47:38] if it ever started it's not eternal life
[47:41] it could be perpetual life amen it could
[47:42] be life for eons and eons of time
[47:44] but that's not eternal life eternal life
[47:47] has no starting point
[47:48] so if you had an eternal seed gene of
[47:50] god down on the inside of you
[47:52] then it had to come from god and there's
[47:53] no beginning for god there's no
[47:55] beginning for you
[47:58] and so now she's laying there with a
[48:00] german thai
[48:01] seed friends you have to understand this
[48:03] she's laying there with a germatized
[48:05] seed with life
[48:06] in it ready to spring forth
[48:09] oh we're just gonna i just i've got to
[48:11] share something with you
[48:14] you know that we have to be virgin born
[48:20] and we have to be a virgin bride
[48:24] how are we going to be virgin born and a
[48:25] virgin bride when we came the wrong way
[48:28] naturally
[48:29] amen and we've believed all kinds of
[48:30] wrong things and lived a polluted life
[48:32] how can we be called a virgin bride
[48:36] we've believed false doctrines we've
[48:37] been in false systems of man
[48:39] we've we we have come up with our own
[48:41] doctrine sometimes and believe their own
[48:43] funny ideas
[48:44] amen how can we be virgin born
[48:48] and how can we be a virgin bride
[48:54] brother banham told us that this
[48:57] germatic
[48:58] seed was in the womb
[49:01] of your soul and it was sealed off to
[49:05] everything else
[49:07] friends you were already carrying a
[49:10] germatized seed
[49:11] when you came into this life and that
[49:14] means
[49:15] nothing else could get into that wound
[49:17] of your soul
[49:18] nothing else could get in there because
[49:20] it was already sealed
[49:22] it was already germatized you could
[49:24] flirt and have fornications and all
[49:26] kinds of stuff
[49:27] but all that's doing is polluting your
[49:28] mind your spirit realm is accepting
[49:30] false things your intellectual
[49:32] understanding of
[49:33] catholic doctrine and methodist doctrine
[49:35] and some of you might have been into
[49:36] hindu stuff in eastern religions it
[49:38] doesn't matter
[49:39] because that just went as deep as your
[49:41] mind but it never touched the womb of
[49:42] your soul
[49:43] because there was already a planted seed
[49:46] in there
[49:47] and because that seed was already
[49:48] planted your soul is virgin amen
[49:51] and when you hear the virgin word the
[49:53] pure word it brings you to virgin birth
[49:56] amen
[49:56] because it brings that virgin seed to
[49:58] life amen
[50:00] not what man had done in your mind when
[50:02] a man had polluted up with you when
[50:03] you're raising in your education
[50:05] none of that matters because there was
[50:07] already something sealed inside the soul
[50:11] when that word comes to that that word
[50:15] doesn't germinate the seed
[50:19] that word quickens it to life
[50:25] he came the first adam came
[50:28] amen a living soul the last adam came a
[50:31] quickening
[50:32] spirit and he's a quickening spirit here
[50:36] to quicken you and quicken you and
[50:38] quicken you and quicken you and quicken
[50:39] you
[50:40] how by the word
[50:43] hallelujah that's how your virgin bride
[50:46] not because you've lived a clean moral
[50:48] life
[50:48] that's not how your virgin bride your
[50:50] virgin bride because down inside of you
[50:52] was a predestinated seed of god
[50:54] and it was sealed away from the world
[50:55] but at the right time you would come in
[50:57] contact with your maker
[50:59] you would come in contact with your mate
[51:00] and it would bring forth that seed that
[51:02] was already planted there and that is
[51:04] the
[51:04] evidence of your virgin birth and that
[51:07] is the
[51:08] evidence amen of your virginity
[51:12] and now you can be married to him
[51:14] because the seed life
[51:16] proves your virgin
[51:20] hallelujah that should make you shout
[51:23] and dance especially if you've lived a
[51:24] filthy life
[51:25] especially if you've been caught up in
[51:26] false doctrines and false systems of man
[51:28] you should be as happy as happy could be
[51:30] because it's not what i did it's what he
[51:32] did amen
[51:33] he's always done it i've never done it
[51:35] he's always done it
[51:36] this is what grace has done
[51:40] god wanted a virgin bride so he made
[51:42] sure he would have a virgin bride
[51:45] amen hallelujah not because i was good
[51:48] enough not because i was strong enough
[51:50] but because there was
[51:51] already a seed germatic seed planted in
[51:54] my soul
[51:55] i could never be anything but the virgin
[51:57] bride of jesus christ
[51:58] because he will his counsel shall stand
[52:00] and he will do all of his will
[52:04] amen we're not changing his will by our
[52:06] conduct we're not changing his will
[52:08] amen by our lifestyle or by
[52:10] intellectually accepting that this is
[52:11] the message
[52:12] you're not going to change his counsel
[52:13] his counsel will stand and all
[52:15] he'll he will do all of his pleasure and
[52:17] it was his pleasure to have a virgin
[52:19] bride in this last day and it was his
[52:21] pleasure that i would be part of that
[52:24] and because of that he had to secure
[52:26] that from before the foundation of the
[52:28] world
[52:28] and he secured it by writing my name in
[52:30] the lamb's book of life and seeing to it
[52:32] that that portion of himself
[52:34] that would come out of him would be
[52:35] planted in this portion of the dirt
[52:37] right here
[52:38] and he made sure that i would come in
[52:40] contact with the s-o-n
[52:41] light it's all god's doing it's not your
[52:44] doing it's not what we've done
[52:46] it's what he's done because it's his
[52:48] pleasure it's his good will
[52:49] it's his purpose
[52:53] we're caught up in a plan so much bigger
[52:55] than our individual selves
[52:57] amen you could have been a prostitute on
[52:59] the street you could have been in
[53:00] prostitute religion
[53:02] amen you could have been a catholic
[53:03] priest
[53:05] serving out false doctrine all the time
[53:08] but if there's a predestinated seed of
[53:09] eternal life laying in there
[53:11] when that light comes to and it springs
[53:13] forth it's the evidence that you're
[53:14] virgin virgin bride to jesus christ
[53:21] hallelujah i don't know about you but
[53:24] that makes me
[53:24] happy that little prostitute with life
[53:29] in her predestinated to eternal life
[53:32] and her name is immortally in the word
[53:34] of god
[53:36] walk up there and the first time the
[53:38] light struck that little seed quickly
[53:39] she knowed it
[53:41] brother bam says in thinking man's
[53:43] filter
[53:45] notice the word cannot deny itself
[53:48] then it's satisfied or it's it's the
[53:50] desire it's a desire of what
[53:52] what made you desire in the first place
[53:54] because down in your
[53:56] soul there was a predestinated seed that
[53:58] was eternal life
[54:02] that seed was already eternal life
[54:06] it already had life in it it was just
[54:10] laying dormant
[54:11] sleeping waiting for the appointed time
[54:15] in your soul there was a predestinated
[54:17] seed which was eternal life
[54:19] always laying in there always was
[54:23] in there
[54:27] friends this is the message
[54:31] that was always in there that seed of
[54:34] eternal life was
[54:35] always amen was always
[54:38] in there all that the father hath given
[54:41] me will come to me there isn't any of
[54:42] them going to be lost
[54:44] a thinking man's taste when a thinking
[54:46] man hears the word of god
[54:47] my sheep hear my voice a stranger they
[54:49] will not follow
[54:50] for down in there is life and life
[54:53] connects with life that's why the word
[54:56] comes it connects with the life on the
[54:58] inside
[54:59] the word comes to the word the word
[55:01] quickens the word
[55:02] life comes to awaken life
[55:05] hallelujah that's why when you heard
[55:08] this message something inside of you
[55:10] stirred
[55:10] there was an attraction amen and it may
[55:12] have felt like the wrong kind of
[55:14] attraction to you at the time
[55:15] amen when i first heard this message i
[55:17] didn't want to be attracted to it
[55:20] i didn't want to believe it i didn't
[55:22] want it to be right amen
[55:23] it was inconvenient for me for this to
[55:26] be the truth
[55:28] i wanted to prove it wrong i wanted to
[55:30] fight against it amen
[55:32] i wanted to show that it was false but
[55:34] the more i read the more life came and
[55:36] the more i read more life came
[55:38] and finally that word that predestinated
[55:40] that that pure word
[55:42] awakened a predestinated seed lying
[55:45] inside of me
[55:47] i didn't go looking for it it found me
[55:50] that little seed that's laying in the
[55:52] earth
[55:54] it doesn't really know what it needs the
[55:56] german to come to life it's germatized
[55:58] it doesn't really
[55:58] know what the conditions are it's just
[56:01] laying there
[56:02] dormant sleeping inactive
[56:06] but it's got all the ingredients for
[56:08] life
[56:09] the conditions just have to get right it
[56:12] wasn't
[56:13] it wasn't the seed that found the sun it
[56:15] was the sun that found the seed
[56:19] it wasn't you that found the message it
[56:20] was god jesus christ
[56:22] found you and awakened you
[56:26] let's turn to first peter chapter 1.
[56:31] with all these quotes in our mind i want
[56:33] to read now first peter chapter 1
[56:35] and take a fresh look at it
[56:46] first peter chapter 1.
[56:57] first peter 1 and 22.
[57:10] for i'm sorry let's go to 23.
[57:14] being born again not of corruptable seed
[57:18] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[57:21] which liveth and abideth forever let's
[57:24] read that again
[57:25] being born again not of corruptible seek
[57:28] see that's how you were born the first
[57:29] time
[57:31] you were born the first time if
[57:32] corruptible again so you have to be born
[57:33] again
[57:34] but you can't be born again the same way
[57:36] you were born the first time
[57:37] nicodemus asked this question and and
[57:40] the lord shot him down he says
[57:42] so so you're born again not of
[57:44] incorruptible seed
[57:45] but of incorruptible by
[57:49] the word of god
[57:52] that means your new birth is the
[57:55] incorruptible seed that's already there
[57:58] amen being born again by the word of god
[58:02] coming to the incorruptible seed and the
[58:04] incorruptible seed springing to life
[58:06] you're born again not of corruptable
[58:08] like you were before but you're born
[58:10] again of incorruptable
[58:11] by by the word of god it's the word of
[58:14] god that brings this to life
[58:16] and brings the new birth
[58:19] praise the lord hallelujah
[58:23] i think i have some more slides
[58:29] now you understand why brother branham
[58:32] typed this man age
[58:33] this wisdom this understanding with the
[58:35] new birth
[58:37] because you have to see the word for
[58:39] your age
[58:40] it's the word for your day the
[58:41] illumination the light the understanding
[58:44] that's bringing
[58:44] to bringing the seed to life
[58:48] modern events made clear by prophecy he
[58:50] says then if you are a son of god or a
[58:53] daughter of god
[58:54] you were in god all the time but he knew
[58:56] what bed and time that you'd be planted
[58:58] so now
[58:59] you're made a creature a son of god
[59:02] manifested son or daughter of god to
[59:04] meet the challenge of this hour to
[59:06] vindicate the true and living god
[59:08] of this hour the message that's coming
[59:10] forth in this time
[59:12] that's right you was done there before
[59:14] the foundation of the world
[59:15] if it wasn't if you wasn't chose that
[59:18] way
[59:19] no matter how much you try to
[59:20] impersonate it you'll never
[59:22] make it so we
[59:25] we find out now you're made a creature
[59:28] son of god manifest son or daughter of
[59:30] god
[59:30] to meet the challenge of this hour
[59:33] remember he knew what bed and ground you
[59:36] would be planted in
[59:37] and he planted you here not for not for
[59:40] your pleasure
[59:42] not according to your counsel but he
[59:44] planted you in this ground and in this
[59:47] time
[59:47] knowing what bed and ground you'd come
[59:49] forth he did it by his counsel
[59:51] for his pleasure and you're here to meet
[59:53] the challenge of the day
[59:56] that's why you're here you're not here
[59:59] for a three-bedroom house and two cars
[1:00:01] and a retirement account that's not why
[1:00:03] you're here
[1:00:04] if you get those things in life that's
[1:00:05] fine but that's not your purpose for
[1:00:07] existing
[1:00:08] your purpose for existing is to meet the
[1:00:10] challenge of this day
[1:00:13] hallelujah you see how distracting the
[1:00:16] devil constantly wants to distract from
[1:00:17] our main purpose
[1:00:18] because our main purpose is eternal life
[1:00:20] coming to manifestation as a son or
[1:00:22] daughter of god
[1:00:23] and it will influence this world
[1:00:26] and the devil wants to stop that if at
[1:00:28] any cost at all cost
[1:00:30] just don't let them manifest go to
[1:00:33] church just don't manifest
[1:00:35] go say whatever you want to say just
[1:00:37] don't live the real life amen don't let
[1:00:39] that seed life come to life
[1:00:40] please because nothing can stop that
[1:00:47] ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 says but god
[1:00:50] who is rich in mercy for this great love
[1:00:52] wherewith he loved us
[1:00:54] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:00:56] quickened us together with christ
[1:00:58] by grace are you saved and hath raised
[1:01:00] us up together and made us to sit in
[1:01:01] heavenly places in
[1:01:03] christ jesus that in the ages to come he
[1:01:06] might show the exceeding riches of his
[1:01:07] grace
[1:01:08] and this kindness toward us through
[1:01:09] christ jesus for by grace
[1:01:12] are you saved through faith and that not
[1:01:14] of yourselves it is the gift of god
[1:01:16] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:01:19] what in the world have you got to do
[1:01:20] with any of this
[1:01:22] abraham believed god it was imputed on
[1:01:24] him for righteousness and he received
[1:01:26] the seal
[1:01:28] you believed god but not because of what
[1:01:31] you've done
[1:01:31] you were saved by but you were saved by
[1:01:34] grace are you saved through faith and
[1:01:36] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:01:38] god
[1:01:39] and so now righteousness is imputed unto
[1:01:42] you because you believe god because of
[1:01:43] grace amen he's given you faith to
[1:01:46] believe his word
[1:01:47] and then he seals you into the kingdom
[1:01:48] it's what he's done not what you've done
[1:01:52] not of works unless any man should boast
[1:01:54] now listen
[1:01:55] for we are his workmanship
[1:01:58] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:02:03] which god hath before ordained
[1:02:07] that we should walk in them
[1:02:11] there's a purpose for you being here
[1:02:14] you as an individual person right now
[1:02:16] each one of us
[1:02:18] there's a purpose for you being here and
[1:02:20] that purpose is an eternal purpose
[1:02:23] and that is to manifest the word for
[1:02:25] your day
[1:02:28] that is the meet the challenge for your
[1:02:30] day
[1:02:31] so god when he portioned himself out
[1:02:33] amen he portioned out
[1:02:35] and he made he made it come forth amen
[1:02:38] in an
[1:02:38] hour and a day that this portion would
[1:02:41] meet the challenge for that day
[1:02:43] and this portion would meet the
[1:02:44] challenge for that day like i've said
[1:02:46] before
[1:02:46] you would have been a miserable
[1:02:48] christian if you came forth in luther's
[1:02:49] day
[1:02:50] you have been totally unsatisfied if you
[1:02:52] came for in the wesley's day
[1:02:53] because the attribute of god in you is
[1:02:55] desiring something more
[1:02:57] amen than a reformation is designing
[1:03:00] something more than sanctification
[1:03:02] it desires the full manifestation of the
[1:03:04] full word of god
[1:03:05] and nothing but that will satisfy
[1:03:09] amen no distraction of the world no
[1:03:13] other idea is going to satisfy
[1:03:15] what god has planted there the only
[1:03:16] thing that will satisfy the desire
[1:03:18] that's in that seed
[1:03:19] is the full word that's why you were
[1:03:22] planted
[1:03:23] in this day that's why you didn't come
[1:03:26] up in luther's day and why you didn't
[1:03:27] come up and
[1:03:28] known unto god are all his works from
[1:03:30] before the foundation of the world
[1:03:31] he knew where you'd be he knew what you
[1:03:33] would come forth he knew what he was
[1:03:34] going to do
[1:03:36] it's not a mystery to god
[1:03:40] hallelujah god hath before
[1:03:43] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:03:46] for his pleasure according to his
[1:03:49] counsel
[1:03:50] you're here in this hour to manifest
[1:03:53] him
[1:03:57] the amen says now i've got another thing
[1:03:59] here i want to notice notice i was not
[1:04:01] one of the four beasts that said don't
[1:04:03] touch the oil and the wine
[1:04:05] did you notice that the four beasts had
[1:04:07] been talking but watch
[1:04:09] let me just read out here just a little
[1:04:10] bit said now a measure of penny
[1:04:12] for a wheat for a penny and three
[1:04:14] measures of barley for a penny and see
[1:04:16] that
[1:04:16] thou hurt not the oil and the wine the
[1:04:18] wine and the oil now look here
[1:04:20] and i said i heard a voice in the midst
[1:04:22] of the four beasts what what
[1:04:23] was it the lamb amen it wasn't the four
[1:04:26] beasts the lamb said it why he's going
[1:04:29] to take his
[1:04:30] own that belongs to him he's redeemed it
[1:04:33] amen don't you touch that oil
[1:04:36] no sir not the four beasts but the lamb
[1:04:38] was the one that said it
[1:04:40] now oh my the lamb not the four beasts
[1:04:42] didn't announce this
[1:04:44] the lamb said itself when the four
[1:04:45] beasts said come and see and then they
[1:04:47] went and they seen it like that and he
[1:04:49] said
[1:04:49] a measure of wheat for a penny and four
[1:04:51] see so much this and so much barley but
[1:04:54] then the lamb cried out right among them
[1:04:56] and said
[1:04:56] don't but don't hurt the oil the wine
[1:04:59] and the oil
[1:05:01] amen i just i just put this on here
[1:05:03] because this is where i want to finish
[1:05:05] up today
[1:05:05] we want to show that that your being
[1:05:08] here is predestinated amen the seed
[1:05:10] inside of you came from god
[1:05:12] and your birth your new birth is nothing
[1:05:14] more than that seed coming to life
[1:05:16] period that's it what happens with it
[1:05:19] anything can happen with it any kind of
[1:05:21] sensation or none at all but the thing
[1:05:23] that matters is that seed came to life
[1:05:24] that's the new birth
[1:05:26] you can dance and shout and run the
[1:05:28] aisles and do anything you want amen it
[1:05:30] doesn't matter for not if there's no
[1:05:32] seed there there's no new birth
[1:05:35] amen that is why there's no new birth
[1:05:37] and denominationalism there's no new
[1:05:39] birth outside the message
[1:05:40] because it takes the word it takes the
[1:05:42] life to bring forth the life
[1:05:44] it takes jesus christ the quickening
[1:05:46] spirit who is the word
[1:05:47] to quicken those to quicken all those
[1:05:49] seeds to life there's no new birth
[1:05:51] outside the message
[1:05:54] amen there's only new birth amen where
[1:05:58] where that seed is coming to life
[1:06:00] that's the new birth hallelujah amen
[1:06:04] but here the lamb
[1:06:08] he's he's saying now this is the first
[1:06:10] time he speaks in the
[1:06:12] first three seals it's always one of the
[1:06:14] four beasts who are saying
[1:06:16] come and see come and see they're the
[1:06:17] announcers of the seal
[1:06:19] but now we get to a place where now
[1:06:21] they're announcing the seal but then
[1:06:23] jesus is saying
[1:06:24] wait a minute amen he's putting
[1:06:27] limitations
[1:06:28] on the dark horse rider think about
[1:06:32] this the dark horse rider goes out with
[1:06:34] a scale in his hands
[1:06:35] and he's going to strip the world of its
[1:06:37] economy and he's going to strip the
[1:06:38] believers of everything they have
[1:06:39] amen he's going to sell them natural
[1:06:41] life in place of spiritual life
[1:06:43] and he's going to strip them down to a
[1:06:44] famine condition
[1:06:46] and god and jesus christ knows that he's
[1:06:48] going he declared this before it ever
[1:06:51] happened
[1:06:51] amen this black horse this seal that was
[1:06:53] broken it was broken when john was on
[1:06:56] earth amen
[1:06:57] and this wasn't going to happen for
[1:06:59] hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:07:00] so jesus is sitting there looking at it
[1:07:02] knowing that it's going to come to the
[1:07:04] dark ages for the believer
[1:07:06] knowing that he's going to ride he's
[1:07:07] going to have a scale that he's going to
[1:07:09] measure out natural life
[1:07:10] he knows all of that but in doing that
[1:07:12] he says you can sell
[1:07:14] that for a penny and you can sell this
[1:07:16] for a penny
[1:07:17] i'm going to let you sell your natural
[1:07:19] life i'm going to let you substitute
[1:07:21] but do not touch the oil and the wine
[1:07:24] that means the lamb is in absolute
[1:07:27] control of the horse riders
[1:07:31] and we find it that to me is one of the
[1:07:32] greatest revelations in the seals
[1:07:34] one of the greatest in the third seal
[1:07:36] amen is not what the black horse is or
[1:07:38] what the man is the greatest revelation
[1:07:40] to me
[1:07:41] is that black horse rider cannot do
[1:07:43] anything outside of the boundaries that
[1:07:45] the lamb put on it
[1:07:46] when the lamb said you don't touch it he
[1:07:48] can't touch it when the lamb said you
[1:07:50] can do this then he can do that but he
[1:07:52] cannot do what the lamb did not give him
[1:07:54] permission to do
[1:07:56] hallelujah we know now that our lives
[1:07:59] are orchestrated our trials are under
[1:08:01] control
[1:08:01] there's no horse rider going to ride in
[1:08:03] your life outside of the boundaries that
[1:08:05] god has placed there
[1:08:06] he cannot outwit god he cannot outdo god
[1:08:09] he cannot outflank god
[1:08:11] but god is already predetermined before
[1:08:13] it happened
[1:08:14] these are the boundaries you'll not
[1:08:16] cross these boundaries
[1:08:20] remember we're here for his purpose his
[1:08:23] pleasure to manifest his word
[1:08:25] to meet the obstacles of our day
[1:08:28] that means there's going to be obstacles
[1:08:32] let's go to romans together i want to
[1:08:34] read through romans just a little bit
[1:08:37] hallelujah friends
[1:08:40] these are the greatest revelations we
[1:08:42] have ever seen
[1:08:47] if i can find romans i'll turn to it
[1:08:50] romans
[1:08:51] 8.
[1:08:55] romans chapter 8 verse 26.
[1:08:59] i tell you what friends we know this
[1:09:00] bible we've heard it we've read it
[1:09:02] but oh my now when i read it it's just
[1:09:05] different
[1:09:06] this is opening more and more and more
[1:09:09] romans chapter 8 verse 26 likewise the
[1:09:12] spirit also helped with our infirmities
[1:09:14] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:09:16] as we ought but the spirit itself maketh
[1:09:18] intercession for us
[1:09:19] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:09:21] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:09:23] what is the mind of the spirit
[1:09:25] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:09:27] saints according to the will of god
[1:09:30] now listen he doesn't make intercessions
[1:09:32] on the saints according to your will
[1:09:36] because if he did you wouldn't go
[1:09:37] through any trials
[1:09:40] but your trials are ordained how else
[1:09:43] will you be an overcomer
[1:09:45] how else will you meet the obstacle for
[1:09:47] your day the challenge for your day how
[1:09:48] else will you manifest the word
[1:09:50] jesus manifests the word against
[1:09:52] opposition
[1:09:53] noah manifests the word against
[1:09:54] opposition amen abraham manifest the
[1:09:57] word against opposition
[1:09:58] moses manifest the word against
[1:10:00] opposition amen the
[1:10:02] the disciples manifest the word against
[1:10:04] opposition how are you going to manifest
[1:10:05] the word without opposition
[1:10:09] it's impossible verse 28
[1:10:12] and we know that all things work
[1:10:14] together for good to them that love god
[1:10:16] to them who are the called according to
[1:10:18] his purpose
[1:10:20] not called many are called but few are
[1:10:22] chosen but there is the
[1:10:23] called according to his purpose for whom
[1:10:27] he did for know he also did predestinate
[1:10:29] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:10:32] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:10:34] many brethren
[1:10:36] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:10:38] he also called and whom he called
[1:10:40] them he also justified whom he justified
[1:10:44] then he also glorified
[1:10:47] friends for you it's a finished work
[1:10:49] you're already justified you're already
[1:10:51] called you're already chosen you're
[1:10:52] already glorified
[1:10:53] so when jesus comes to the place where
[1:10:55] he can say father glorify me with the
[1:10:56] glory that i had with you before
[1:10:58] you can say the same thing because in
[1:11:00] the mind of god you're already been
[1:11:03] glorified
[1:11:05] you're not going to be lost you're not
[1:11:06] going to fail you're not going to miss
[1:11:08] anything friends all that he's calling
[1:11:10] for is a greater surrender a greater
[1:11:12] surrender but you're not going to miss a
[1:11:14] thing
[1:11:14] friends it's already finished in the
[1:11:16] mind of god you've already been
[1:11:18] glorified
[1:11:19] and when we get to the end of our
[1:11:20] earthly journey we can say god would you
[1:11:22] glorify me with the glory that i had
[1:11:24] with you before
[1:11:28] hallelujah
[1:11:32] what shall we then say to these things
[1:11:34] if god before us
[1:11:36] who can be against us
[1:11:39] hallelujah does that scripture mean more
[1:11:41] to you now than it did before
[1:11:45] amen of god before us who can be against
[1:11:47] us he that spared not his own son but
[1:11:49] delivered him up for us oh how
[1:11:51] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:11:53] us all things
[1:11:55] whom shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:11:57] god's elect it is god that justifieth
[1:11:59] amen how can you lay anything to my i'm
[1:12:02] virgin born
[1:12:04] i've come to the virgin birth amen by
[1:12:06] the pure word has brought me back into a
[1:12:08] virgin condition
[1:12:09] just like i was in the beginning he's
[1:12:11] brought me back to my ought to be
[1:12:13] conditioned amen
[1:12:14] in my soul he's returned me back to my
[1:12:16] ought to be conditioned to my virgin
[1:12:19] condition
[1:12:20] what about all those sins what sins i
[1:12:22] have no sins
[1:12:24] well i saw you do something wrong i
[1:12:26] didn't do it
[1:12:29] amen because it can't a man cannot sin
[1:12:33] because the seed remaineth in him i
[1:12:35] cannot disbelieve this word
[1:12:36] amen you can see all kinds of
[1:12:38] manifestations and false but i cannot
[1:12:40] disbelieve this in my soul
[1:12:42] my mind can get confused i can have
[1:12:44] doubts in my brain but that doesn't have
[1:12:46] anything to do with what really matters
[1:12:48] what matters is that portion that came
[1:12:49] from god that's dwelling inside this
[1:12:51] tabernacle of flesh
[1:12:53] that's the part that god's watching
[1:12:54] that's what god cares about
[1:12:57] that's what's being redeemed friends
[1:13:01] that that came from god and that part of
[1:13:03] me cannot disbelieve the word of god
[1:13:05] no matter what you see on the outside i
[1:13:08] have no sin i have no more consciousness
[1:13:10] of sin
[1:13:10] because the seed has been quickened to
[1:13:12] life and i
[1:13:13] believe and accept and receive the word
[1:13:15] of god
[1:13:18] amen remember when when we come to the
[1:13:22] pure
[1:13:23] blood of jesus christ amen the blood
[1:13:25] that's flowing fresh and clean this
[1:13:27] morning
[1:13:28] not that dry not the blood that dried on
[1:13:30] a post
[1:13:31] amen in galgotha not that blood not the
[1:13:34] blood that dried amen in the ground
[1:13:36] but when we come to the blood the life
[1:13:38] of the blood the life that was in that
[1:13:40] blood that's flowing today
[1:13:42] that's flowing this morning by the by
[1:13:44] the word being preached
[1:13:45] when we come to that life when you
[1:13:47] receive that blood life
[1:13:49] that blood life is the clorox bleach
[1:13:51] amen
[1:13:52] and your sin drops into that clorox
[1:13:54] bleach
[1:13:55] and it disbands and it goes right back
[1:13:58] to the originator of sin
[1:14:00] which is the devil himself
[1:14:04] so when you've come to that life friends
[1:14:06] when you've come under that fresh
[1:14:07] atonement when you've come under that
[1:14:09] blood of jesus christ
[1:14:10] which is the spirit of god today when
[1:14:12] you've come under that it's
[1:14:14] taken your sins and it put it back to
[1:14:16] the devil
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:19] it's not yours anymore that's why
[1:14:20] there's no record of your sin
[1:14:22] because the record of your sin
[1:14:23] transferred to the originator of sin
[1:14:25] and you've gone back to your original
[1:14:27] ought to be conditioned in your soul
[1:14:29] there's a transfer that takes place by
[1:14:31] the redemptive blood of jesus christ
[1:14:33] and it doesn't do you it doesn't do you
[1:14:35] any good to try to scrape dried blood
[1:14:37] off of a post
[1:14:40] everybody knows there was bloodshed
[1:14:42] there but where is his blood
[1:14:44] now where can i be covered in the
[1:14:46] atoning blood of jesus christ today
[1:14:48] where is it it's in the spirit friends
[1:14:50] the spirit is the life that was inside
[1:14:52] of that blood
[1:14:53] when jesus walked that life has come
[1:14:55] back to us and that is atoning for us
[1:14:57] it is washing us it is removing our sins
[1:15:00] away and that brings me back to a virgin
[1:15:02] condition
[1:15:03] and that puts my sin on the devil the
[1:15:05] originator of the world
[1:15:10] oh praise god the things this prophet
[1:15:13] has told us
[1:15:14] friends why does he fight against you
[1:15:17] because he has to bear
[1:15:18] now finally after all of these years he
[1:15:21] now has to bear the iniquity for his own
[1:15:23] crimes he now has to be he's the
[1:15:26] transgressor
[1:15:26] before he comes down and he does crimes
[1:15:29] and everybody else has to pay for it
[1:15:32] right amen eve falls
[1:15:35] adam leaves the word amen they they fall
[1:15:39] from what they were told to do
[1:15:41] and now everybody else has to suffer and
[1:15:43] the devil comes down
[1:15:44] and he shows his unbelief and he works
[1:15:46] and everybody suffers
[1:15:47] but now when we come back to the true
[1:15:49] atonement in this age
[1:15:50] it brings us back to our ought to be
[1:15:53] conditioned and puts all of the crimes
[1:15:55] back on him and now he's caught
[1:15:57] red-handed friends
[1:15:59] that's why he hates this word that's why
[1:16:01] he hates this revelation
[1:16:03] that's why he hates you because now he
[1:16:05] has to bear all that stuff he's put on
[1:16:07] you
[1:16:09] all that manipulating your human spirit
[1:16:11] manipulating your thinking
[1:16:13] manipulating people around you to get
[1:16:15] you to fall to get you to sin
[1:16:16] to get you to do things you ought not to
[1:16:18] do amen he's the one who does it he sows
[1:16:20] it into you then he stands back and lets
[1:16:22] you pay for it
[1:16:25] but through the pure atonement through
[1:16:26] the true true atonement now
[1:16:28] he's got to pay for his own crimes
[1:16:32] hallelujah only
[1:16:36] through the atonement does he have to
[1:16:38] pay
[1:16:41] without the atonement he doesn't have to
[1:16:43] pay your sin remains on you
[1:16:46] you go to a judgment with your own sin
[1:16:49] but through atonement
[1:16:51] he has to pay that's why he hates this
[1:16:55] message
[1:16:57] it's this message that will defeat him
[1:16:59] in this day
[1:17:05] who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:17:07] god's elect verse 33
[1:17:09] it is god that justifieth who is he that
[1:17:12] condemneth it is christ that died yet
[1:17:14] rather that has risen again who is even
[1:17:15] at the right hand of god
[1:17:16] who also make intercession for us who
[1:17:19] shall separate us from the love of
[1:17:21] christ
[1:17:22] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:17:25] persecution
[1:17:26] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[1:17:30] as is written for thy sake are we killed
[1:17:32] all the day long
[1:17:33] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:17:34] slaughter name and all these things we
[1:17:36] are more than conquerors through him
[1:17:38] that
[1:17:38] loved us for i am persuaded that neither
[1:17:41] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:17:43] principalities nor powers
[1:17:45] nor things present nor things to come
[1:17:47] nor height nor death nor
[1:17:48] any other creature shall be able to
[1:17:50] separate us from the love of god
[1:17:52] which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:17:56] you know what that tells me
[1:18:01] that the devil will try famine and
[1:18:04] nakedness and sword and peril and
[1:18:06] pestilence
[1:18:09] and that means that we will overcome
[1:18:12] famine and nakedness in perilous times
[1:18:14] amen this god has not
[1:18:18] called us to live an easy life he's
[1:18:21] called us to be overcomers and manifest
[1:18:23] his word in this day
[1:18:26] none of these things shall separate us
[1:18:27] when you go read hebrews 11
[1:18:29] go read hebrews 11 at the end it said
[1:18:31] those who who who
[1:18:33] received their dead back to life they
[1:18:34] stopped the mounds of lion they stopped
[1:18:36] the flames
[1:18:37] amen they were sawn asunder they were
[1:18:40] persecuted
[1:18:41] they were chased from the they were hid
[1:18:43] in the rocks and the dens of the caves
[1:18:45] they went about in sheepskins and goat
[1:18:47] skins destitute and afflicted
[1:18:52] hebrews 11 is a chapter about overcoming
[1:18:55] faith
[1:18:57] the the heroes of the faith amen the
[1:19:00] heroes of the faith
[1:19:01] you want to see a hero of a faith he's
[1:19:03] in a camel skin hid in the cave
[1:19:05] chased from place to place persecuted
[1:19:07] afflicted stone
[1:19:08] they threw rocks at him they spit on him
[1:19:10] they mocked him they scourged him
[1:19:11] how did he how was he an overcomer
[1:19:13] because he never
[1:19:14] left his faith he was a manifest son of
[1:19:19] god despite the trials
[1:19:20] despite the circumstances no matter what
[1:19:23] happens he was going to overcome
[1:19:28] hallelujah friends oh
[1:19:34] mine
[1:19:38] jeremiah 1 4 says then the word of the
[1:19:40] lord came unto me saying
[1:19:42] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[1:19:44] thee
[1:19:46] and before thou came us forth out of the
[1:19:48] womb i sanctified thee
[1:19:50] and ordained thee a prophet unto the
[1:19:52] nations
[1:19:54] do you know jeremiah was referred to as
[1:19:56] the weeping prophet
[1:19:58] jeremiah wrote the book of lamentations
[1:20:02] jeremiah's life was a difficult life of
[1:20:04] affliction
[1:20:05] persecution imprisonment and rejection
[1:20:09] and here's what god says before i formed
[1:20:12] thee in the belly
[1:20:14] i knew thee
[1:20:17] before his earthly tabernacle was even
[1:20:19] formed in the belly
[1:20:20] god knew him and before he came us forth
[1:20:23] out of the womb
[1:20:24] i sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[1:20:26] prophet unto the nations
[1:20:28] if he would say that to you and i we'd
[1:20:30] walk around like this
[1:20:32] to hear what he said about me he knew me
[1:20:35] i'm predestinated
[1:20:36] i'm elected i'm called to be a prophet
[1:20:38] to the nations
[1:20:40] but he was called to manifest the word
[1:20:42] in his day
[1:20:44] against all obstacles against all odds
[1:20:48] in the face of all persecutions amen he
[1:20:51] did what god asked him to do regardless
[1:20:52] of what god asked him
[1:20:53] god asked him to lay naked on his side
[1:20:55] he lay naked on his side
[1:20:57] god asked him to go say something to a
[1:20:59] king he said it to a king if many went
[1:21:00] in prison he went in prison
[1:21:02] amen he stayed true to the word of god
[1:21:04] and he manifest his word for his day
[1:21:06] no matter what happened to him why
[1:21:09] because before he was even formed god
[1:21:12] and his mind had already ordained the
[1:21:14] works that he would do
[1:21:15] we are his workmanship created in christ
[1:21:17] jesus unto good works which god has
[1:21:20] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:21:22] them
[1:21:22] there's a work for you to do there's a
[1:21:24] work for me to do and it doesn't matter
[1:21:26] obstacle it doesn't matter what we have
[1:21:28] to overcome we are made to overcome
[1:21:37] god put him on the earth to overcome
[1:21:44] god put jeremiah on the earth
[1:21:47] to be afflicted to be rejected
[1:21:51] to write the book of lamentations god
[1:21:54] had already ordained all of that for
[1:21:56] jeremiah
[1:21:58] so he put something inside of jeremiah
[1:22:01] that would overcome
[1:22:03] against all lives god has called you to
[1:22:06] overcome
[1:22:07] every kind of situation known to man the
[1:22:09] bride of jesus christ is not coming
[1:22:11] always out of
[1:22:12] pink decorated rooms they're coming
[1:22:16] through all kinds of marriage situations
[1:22:17] all kinds of children situations
[1:22:19] all kinds of things and sometimes you
[1:22:21] scratch your head on why
[1:22:22] why did i go through that and why did i
[1:22:24] go through this and why was my childhood
[1:22:26] this way
[1:22:26] and how come my daddy didn't love me and
[1:22:28] how come somebody abused me and beat me
[1:22:30] and why was i neglected and why did
[1:22:32] nobody in school love me
[1:22:33] why didn't i ever have a home
[1:22:37] think about it friends god
[1:22:40] has ordained it so
[1:22:44] god has called it to be this way
[1:22:48] listen to job i'm going to read from job
[1:22:51] chapter 1 verse 6.
[1:22:52] now there was a day when the sons of god
[1:22:54] came to present themselves before the
[1:22:56] lord and satan came also among them
[1:22:58] and the lord said unto satan whence
[1:23:00] cometh thou
[1:23:01] and satan answered the lord and said
[1:23:03] from going to and fro in the earth and
[1:23:05] from walking up and down in it
[1:23:07] and the lord said unto satan hast thou
[1:23:09] considered my servant job
[1:23:12] there is none like him in the earth a
[1:23:15] perfect and upright man one that feareth
[1:23:17] god and the skew with evil
[1:23:19] then satan answered the lord and said
[1:23:20] does job fear god for not hast thou not
[1:23:22] made a hedge about him
[1:23:24] about his house and about all that he
[1:23:25] hath on every side
[1:23:27] thou has blessed the work of his hands
[1:23:29] and his substance is increased in the
[1:23:31] land
[1:23:31] but put forth thy hand now and touch all
[1:23:34] that he hath
[1:23:35] and he will curse thee to thy face
[1:23:39] now here's a challenge that god
[1:23:43] gives to satan
[1:23:47] yes saying where have you been i've been
[1:23:48] roaming to earth you're walking up to
[1:23:49] and fro
[1:23:50] and and he says have you ever considered
[1:23:54] job you're out there tempting and trying
[1:23:58] and people are falling away
[1:23:59] and you're having your successes over
[1:24:01] there and you're having your successes
[1:24:02] over here
[1:24:03] but i've got one that you won't beat
[1:24:07] i've got one that you cannot defeat have
[1:24:10] you ever considered
[1:24:11] job do you think god didn't know what
[1:24:14] was inside of job do you think
[1:24:16] he didn't already know what would happen
[1:24:17] if he come under persecution if he'd
[1:24:19] come under
[1:24:19] extreme pressure what was going to
[1:24:21] happen to job god already knew amen he
[1:24:24] knows
[1:24:25] known to god are all his works from
[1:24:26] before the foundation
[1:24:28] that's either true or it's not true
[1:24:30] friends
[1:24:32] we were ordained amen unto good works
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:35] so job he says jobs everything's going
[1:24:38] right
[1:24:39] and god put a hedge of protection about
[1:24:41] him and he's got
[1:24:42] massive wealth and he's got children
[1:24:44] he's got respect
[1:24:46] and why does he have all of those things
[1:24:47] god is just setting him up
[1:24:51] god's just moving in a position so that
[1:24:53] he can demonstrate the seed life
[1:24:56] so he can demonstrate a life of faith
[1:24:59] these things can go along so well for us
[1:25:01] so long sometimes
[1:25:03] and everything's just cruising right
[1:25:04] along and families happy
[1:25:06] kitties are happy job is good
[1:25:08] everything's going good and all of a
[1:25:10] sudden a series of things can happen in
[1:25:11] your life boom boom boom boom
[1:25:13] and all of a sudden the car's broke down
[1:25:15] you can't make the mortgage payment lost
[1:25:17] the job
[1:25:18] everything's falling apart and all of a
[1:25:20] sudden we start saying what did i do
[1:25:21] wrong what did i do wrong what did i do
[1:25:23] wrong
[1:25:25] god just brings you up so that he can
[1:25:28] bring you down
[1:25:29] so that he can show the world nothing
[1:25:32] can defeat a seed of god
[1:25:37] he asked him if you consider job
[1:25:41] he says if put you put forth thine hand
[1:25:44] now
[1:25:45] this is satan talking to to god put
[1:25:48] forth thine hand now
[1:25:50] and touch all that he hath and he will
[1:25:51] curse thee to thy face and the lord said
[1:25:53] unto satan behold
[1:25:55] all that he hath is in thy power only
[1:25:57] upon himself put not forth thine hand
[1:25:59] so satan went forth from the presence of
[1:26:01] the lord
[1:26:03] measure of wheat for a penny three
[1:26:06] measures of barley for a penny
[1:26:07] don't touch the oil and wine all that he
[1:26:10] has
[1:26:11] in your hand don't touch him it's the
[1:26:13] same god all the time
[1:26:15] friends the same one that's here in job
[1:26:17] directing the trial for job is the same
[1:26:19] one that's directing through the dark
[1:26:20] ages
[1:26:20] and the third seal is the same one
[1:26:22] that's directing the trial in your life
[1:26:24] he's the same one who's put the limits
[1:26:26] on satan he's the same one who's called
[1:26:28] for
[1:26:28] called for the manifestation of the word
[1:26:30] in your life who's ordained you into
[1:26:32] good works who has allowed the devil to
[1:26:33] have certain access and has put
[1:26:35] boundaries on his access
[1:26:37] it's the same god all through the bible
[1:26:39] he's not changing
[1:26:43] he says in deuteronomy i want you just
[1:26:45] to listen deuteronomy 8
[1:26:47] verse 1 all the commandments which i
[1:26:48] command thee this day shall you observe
[1:26:50] to do
[1:26:51] that you may live and multiply and go in
[1:26:53] and possess the land which the lord
[1:26:54] swear unto your fathers
[1:26:56] and thou shalt remember all the way
[1:26:57] which the lord thy god led thee these
[1:26:59] forty years in the wilderness
[1:27:01] to humble thee and to prove thee
[1:27:05] god led them through all kinds of trials
[1:27:07] for 40 years
[1:27:08] to humble them and to prove them
[1:27:12] to know what was in thine heart whether
[1:27:14] thou would us keep his commandment
[1:27:16] or no and he humbled thee and suffered
[1:27:20] thee to hunger
[1:27:22] god would suffer you to hunger
[1:27:27] suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[1:27:29] with manna which thou knewest not
[1:27:31] neither did thy fathers know
[1:27:33] that he might make thee know that man
[1:27:35] doth not live by bread only
[1:27:37] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:27:39] the mouth of the lord
[1:27:41] doth man live he suffered you to hunger
[1:27:44] why so he could give you a revelation
[1:27:48] that's what he says i proved you through
[1:27:50] the wilderness journey
[1:27:51] to see whether you loved me or not
[1:27:54] whether you would keep my commandments
[1:27:56] he told abraham to go crucify isaac and
[1:27:59] to go sacrifice isaac
[1:28:01] and he goes to sacrifice isaac and at
[1:28:02] the last second before he plunges the
[1:28:04] knife into his heart
[1:28:05] he stops him he says now i know that
[1:28:07] thou lovest to me
[1:28:10] god knew all along he was just proving
[1:28:12] abraham
[1:28:15] when he called when he called paul i'm
[1:28:18] just trying to lay out some things here
[1:28:19] just pay close attention
[1:28:21] when he called paul he says he told
[1:28:23] agabus
[1:28:24] against was afraid to go up and and talk
[1:28:26] to him
[1:28:27] and he says go thy way for he is a
[1:28:30] chosen vessel
[1:28:31] unto me he's a chosen vessel unto me
[1:28:34] inside of him is a seed there's an
[1:28:36] attribute that's got to be expressed
[1:28:38] and he's a chosen vessel unto me to bear
[1:28:40] my name before the gentiles and kings
[1:28:42] and the children of israel
[1:28:43] for i will show him how great things he
[1:28:45] must suffer from my name's sake
[1:28:49] what a calling friends god when he
[1:28:53] called paul
[1:28:54] he didn't make no bones about it he
[1:28:56] called paul and he says i will show him
[1:28:58] what things he must suffer for my name
[1:28:59] sake
[1:29:00] why because he's a chosen vessel and
[1:29:02] because the chosen vessel he has to
[1:29:03] suffer
[1:29:06] this isn't good american doctrine this
[1:29:08] is good christian doctrine
[1:29:12] he has to suffer because he's a chosen
[1:29:15] vessel
[1:29:16] he looks at peter he says peter when you
[1:29:18] were young
[1:29:19] you girded yourself and went where you
[1:29:20] want but when you were old you'll
[1:29:22] stretch forth thy hand
[1:29:23] and another will gird thee and lead you
[1:29:24] where you would as not signifying what
[1:29:27] death that he should die from
[1:29:29] he told us he told his disciples before
[1:29:31] he departed he says
[1:29:32] amen he says in this world you shall
[1:29:34] have tribulation
[1:29:36] that's a promise
[1:29:39] he's not telling them a flowery bed of
[1:29:41] ease he's not telling them rosie tells
[1:29:43] what's he telling him he's telling him
[1:29:44] you'll be afflicted tormented
[1:29:47] stoned run from city to city when paul
[1:29:50] starts rehearsing his life and he starts
[1:29:53] telling about
[1:29:54] i was i was went from city to city
[1:29:56] stoned
[1:29:57] and i received stripes this many times
[1:29:59] and all of these horrible things
[1:30:00] happened to me
[1:30:01] he wasn't complaining he was boasting of
[1:30:04] what faith and god would do
[1:30:05] he was boasting what god was able to do
[1:30:08] through a human being
[1:30:09] that though you'd be beaten smitten left
[1:30:11] in the deep
[1:30:12] it doesn't matter you can't kill this
[1:30:14] seed
[1:30:16] you can beat it you can stone it you can
[1:30:18] reject it you can spit on it you can
[1:30:20] laugh at it but you cannot stop the seed
[1:30:22] from believing the word and you cannot
[1:30:24] stop the seed from manifesting the word
[1:30:27] there's nothing the devil can do to you
[1:30:29] to get you to stop he can take your
[1:30:31] loved one he can take your child
[1:30:33] amen he could upset your whole world and
[1:30:35] though he slayed me
[1:30:36] yet will i serve him that's the seed
[1:30:39] life coming forth
[1:30:40] that's a faith life amen coming forth
[1:30:47] brother ma'am said in the message
[1:30:48] believeth thou this and i just want to
[1:30:49] read a few quotes
[1:30:51] then then wrap it up here
[1:30:55] now zechariah is getting himself in
[1:30:58] order getting his church ready zechariah
[1:31:00] is the high priest or
[1:31:01] great priest rather he was to burn
[1:31:02] incense he had
[1:31:04] he had a home that was consecrated to
[1:31:06] god god give us some more homes like
[1:31:08] that yes sir they believed god and
[1:31:10] waited on god and elizabeth his wife was
[1:31:12] barren
[1:31:13] she was way past the age now and she was
[1:31:15] barren and had prayed for years for god
[1:31:17] to give them children but seemingly
[1:31:19] he had not done it sometimes god holds
[1:31:22] off to the very last moment
[1:31:25] just to see what you will do about it it
[1:31:30] says and be certain of god
[1:31:33] and the woman as she's seen the crucial
[1:31:35] hour coming no doubt she checked up and
[1:31:37] said lord
[1:31:38] i've done all that i know to do when
[1:31:40] you've done everything that you know how
[1:31:42] to do and
[1:31:42] met every requirement that god has
[1:31:44] required that's where faith takes hold
[1:31:47] that's where faith comes in if you've
[1:31:49] met every requirement that god required
[1:31:51] you to do
[1:31:52] then sometimes god tests your faith to
[1:31:54] see what kind of reaction you'll have on
[1:31:56] your action
[1:31:59] oh he's good at that
[1:32:02] just it just proves whether you really
[1:32:05] believe what you think you believe
[1:32:08] you know he does that many times
[1:32:12] in the message when your eyes were open
[1:32:13] they knew him notice as they went now
[1:32:16] two of them cleopas and his friend was
[1:32:17] on their road to emmaus
[1:32:19] it was sunday morning so they was on
[1:32:20] their road over there talking
[1:32:22] they was going along the road real sad
[1:32:24] my they were really let down with
[1:32:26] something
[1:32:26] looked like a veil and god lets things
[1:32:29] happen like that he does that
[1:32:31] purposely just to test you
[1:32:35] now let me get this before you straight
[1:32:36] so that you understand
[1:32:38] that every son that cometh to god has to
[1:32:40] be child trained
[1:32:42] he's got to be tested every son if
[1:32:44] you've never tested you're not a son if
[1:32:46] you
[1:32:46] if you can't stand the chi tasman of god
[1:32:48] then you're illegitimate and not a child
[1:32:50] of god
[1:32:51] you claim god is your father you say oh
[1:32:52] i can't believe well that just shows
[1:32:54] that god is not your father see
[1:32:57] you would get it now notice the testing
[1:32:59] god tests every one of his children
[1:33:01] all that come to him must first be
[1:33:02] tested tried
[1:33:06] proved it says and how can i overcome
[1:33:10] in the days of daniel time there were
[1:33:12] four overcomers that could stand the
[1:33:13] test of fire and lion
[1:33:15] now we're expected to be tested are you
[1:33:17] expected to be tested
[1:33:20] don't be disappointed then when it comes
[1:33:24] when everything goes wrong don't get
[1:33:25] disappointed you expected it
[1:33:28] says johan who expects to be tested
[1:33:31] all right then don't complain
[1:33:35] because you expected it to be tested and
[1:33:37] it's not you being tested as that seed
[1:33:39] life on the inside that's being tested
[1:33:41] god's proving his children and he's
[1:33:42] manifesting himself
[1:33:47] we're expected to be tested that's a
[1:33:49] good lesson my brother back there
[1:33:51] he that cometh to god must first be
[1:33:53] tested tested with the word that's god's
[1:33:55] test you believe it
[1:33:56] he that cometh to god must be tested the
[1:33:58] only show that
[1:33:59] only shows a true child then see be
[1:34:02] tested
[1:34:03] and when the test comes on you when the
[1:34:06] test comes on
[1:34:07] you can't overcome unless there's a test
[1:34:10] given to you
[1:34:11] and when test is given it's to see
[1:34:13] whether you can overcome or not
[1:34:16] and jesus said to him that overcometh
[1:34:19] the test
[1:34:20] the test is the greatest thing that ever
[1:34:21] happened to you
[1:34:23] i believe it it's written in the
[1:34:25] scriptures peter said our trials
[1:34:27] are worth more to us than precious gold
[1:34:29] it's a testing time
[1:34:30] it's one good evidence to us that god is
[1:34:32] with us when we're tested
[1:34:34] for all children of god are tested and
[1:34:37] tried
[1:34:41] job says when i am tested
[1:34:45] i shall come forth as gold
[1:34:48] how many has that kind of faith that
[1:34:49] when i'm tested i shall come forth as
[1:34:51] gold
[1:34:52] see so many times test comes into
[1:34:54] people's lives and
[1:34:55] and things happen that they never
[1:34:57] expected to happen never planned for
[1:34:59] never anticipated amen
[1:35:01] there's death that sets in and sickness
[1:35:03] and and abandonment and all kinds of
[1:35:05] things
[1:35:05] and they get tested and they never
[1:35:07] expected it to come this way
[1:35:09] and then all of a sudden you see that
[1:35:10] they just can't hold to god anymore they
[1:35:12] just can't believe the word because
[1:35:14] it didn't happen the way i expected it
[1:35:16] friends the word believes
[1:35:17] i mean faith the seed believes whether
[1:35:20] it happens like you expect it or not
[1:35:22] it doesn't matter if it happens
[1:35:23] according to the way you desire it it
[1:35:25] doesn't matter if it happens opposite to
[1:35:27] the way you thought it would be
[1:35:28] belief faith always believes the word of
[1:35:31] god
[1:35:32] the seed gene of god will always come
[1:35:34] back to the anchor and the word of god
[1:35:36] and will anchor itself there and hold on
[1:35:38] no matter what happens in my life
[1:35:40] we don't come to christianity to have an
[1:35:42] easy life amen we come here because we
[1:35:45] believe the word
[1:35:46] amen we give our life to god we
[1:35:47] surrender to him because we're part of
[1:35:49] him
[1:35:49] we've come from him we're going back to
[1:35:51] him and now god when he wanted to
[1:35:53] display himself on the earth
[1:35:54] he did it through one man that was jesus
[1:35:56] christ and look at the life of jesus
[1:35:58] christ
[1:36:02] no riches no wealth no place to lie his
[1:36:04] head
[1:36:05] right roaming around from place to place
[1:36:09] amen loved and then hated accepted and
[1:36:11] rejected
[1:36:12] amen until they wanted to kill him amen
[1:36:15] they called him beelzebub they called
[1:36:16] him a false prophet
[1:36:18] they said he was mad they said he was
[1:36:19] illegitimate born
[1:36:21] what was happening god wanted to display
[1:36:23] his attributes
[1:36:25] god wanted to be on display and the only
[1:36:27] way that he could do it was when
[1:36:29] negative was unleashed
[1:36:30] when the enemy was unleashed on jesus
[1:36:33] christ then jesus christ manifest the
[1:36:35] word
[1:36:37] and the only way that he can be
[1:36:38] manifested in this day is when evil is
[1:36:41] unleashed upon the children of god
[1:36:42] and they overcome by faith in the word
[1:36:45] only they don't overcome by their credit
[1:36:47] card they don't overcome by their
[1:36:48] favorite doctor
[1:36:49] they overcome by the word and the word
[1:36:51] only and they hold the faith
[1:36:53] despite everything else it doesn't
[1:36:55] matter what they say it doesn't matter
[1:36:57] what they do
[1:36:57] i believe the word of god and that is
[1:37:00] what god is looking for in this day
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:04] amen
[1:37:10] the prophet of god said god always has
[1:37:12] overcomers
[1:37:14] he's had overcomers in every age
[1:37:18] they're always every time and every age
[1:37:20] that there's been on the earth god has
[1:37:22] always had somebody he could put his
[1:37:24] hand on
[1:37:25] as a witness in the earth look at that
[1:37:27] as a witness in the earth
[1:37:30] i want you to hold on to that he's never
[1:37:32] been without a witness
[1:37:34] though sometimes just one but somebody
[1:37:37] overcome now
[1:37:38] like the saints of old it says in the
[1:37:42] message i know
[1:37:44] it's those crucial hours that press us
[1:37:46] on those sacred sands
[1:37:48] it was in the bible and remember no
[1:37:49] matter how great the distress is satan
[1:37:51] cannot take your life until god is
[1:37:53] finished with you
[1:37:55] there is nothing can happen to you
[1:37:56] unless god permits it
[1:38:01] penny of wheat a measure wheat for a
[1:38:02] penny three measures of barley for a
[1:38:05] penny
[1:38:06] see thou touch not the oil in the wine
[1:38:10] unless god permits it there's no evil
[1:38:11] can come unless god permits it
[1:38:13] and it's for your good he's working that
[1:38:17] let's think there when the floods come
[1:38:18] to destroy the world it could not
[1:38:20] destroy noah noah could not be destroyed
[1:38:22] because that god had a work for him to
[1:38:24] do
[1:38:25] and one day down in a great nation under
[1:38:26] a great bondage there was some
[1:38:28] hebrew children that we know as shadrach
[1:38:30] meshach and abednego
[1:38:32] and it came to a place where they had to
[1:38:33] make a decision that something had to be
[1:38:35] done
[1:38:36] their faith was put to a test and when
[1:38:38] their faith is put to a test
[1:38:40] they won't fail stay right with what you
[1:38:43] believe
[1:38:44] and when their face faith was put to a
[1:38:47] test
[1:38:48] they went through a crucial hour and not
[1:38:49] only did they go to an ash heap but they
[1:38:51] went to a fiery furnace
[1:38:53] but satan could not destroy them for
[1:38:55] god's purpose wasn't yet fulfilled
[1:38:57] they could go in there with this hope i
[1:38:59] know my redeemer liveth
[1:39:00] they could go in there with this hope
[1:39:02] here we are assured that god is able to
[1:39:04] deliver us from thy fiery furnace but
[1:39:05] nevertheless
[1:39:06] we will not bow to the image if god
[1:39:10] doesn't answer your prayer will you
[1:39:11] still serve him
[1:39:13] if he doesn't heal your body will you
[1:39:14] still serve him
[1:39:16] if he takes your family member from you
[1:39:17] will you still serve him
[1:39:19] that's what he's looking for friends
[1:39:25] satan could not take them he could not
[1:39:27] drown no in the flood until the purpose
[1:39:28] of god had been finished he could not
[1:39:30] burn up the hebrew children until the
[1:39:31] purpose of god had been finished
[1:39:32] he could not kill job with boils and
[1:39:34] troubles until the purpose of god had
[1:39:36] been finished
[1:39:36] neither could the lions eat daniel until
[1:39:38] god's purpose had been finished
[1:39:40] neither could death and old age take
[1:39:41] abraham until the purpose of god had
[1:39:43] been finished
[1:39:44] and neither can it take you or can it
[1:39:46] take me until the purpose of god of our
[1:39:47] life is finished
[1:39:49] so we gather from their consolation and
[1:39:52] why does god let troubles come
[1:39:53] god harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[1:39:56] mouth and makes it obey him
[1:39:58] and those troubles bring us into a
[1:40:00] closer fellowship with god
[1:40:03] do you ever thank god for your trial
[1:40:06] thank them
[1:40:06] thank you god for this trouble that's
[1:40:08] come upon me thank you for this
[1:40:09] affliction thank you for this rejection
[1:40:11] because i know you're in control of all
[1:40:13] things and if you say that i need to go
[1:40:16] through this now
[1:40:16] i'm happy to go through
[1:40:24] there had been no rainbow until the
[1:40:26] flood came but after noah was pressed
[1:40:28] into that condition that he was in
[1:40:30] to float 40 days and nights in a storm
[1:40:32] and the little ark pitching up and down
[1:40:33] in the water
[1:40:34] it was after the flood was over that he
[1:40:36] saw the rainbow for its first time
[1:40:38] the covenant of hope the covenant of
[1:40:40] promise after he went through the
[1:40:42] tribulation then he saw the promise
[1:40:44] that's the way you see the promise after
[1:40:46] you've gone through the tribulation
[1:40:48] i've liked that poem or psalm must i be
[1:40:50] carried home to heaven
[1:40:51] on a flowery bed of ease while others
[1:40:53] fought to win the prize and sailed
[1:40:54] through bloody seas
[1:40:56] we ask for comfort and peace god gives
[1:40:58] us the best he could give us
[1:41:00] trials and tribulations that's better
[1:41:02] than comfort and peace
[1:41:04] our conference is just beyond the river
[1:41:08] it wasn't until the hebrew children was
[1:41:09] forced into the fiery furnace on one of
[1:41:11] their most outstanding trials
[1:41:13] that they seen one like the son of man
[1:41:14] stand among them
[1:41:17] think about it friends a manifestation
[1:41:19] of jesus christ
[1:41:21] before jesus was a baby in a manger
[1:41:25] when was he manifest when they went to
[1:41:28] the fire
[1:41:30] think about that
[1:41:33] their troubles produced the son of god
[1:41:35] standing among them
[1:41:36] in breezes to wave away the heat wave
[1:41:39] but not until they went to the fire did
[1:41:41] the comforter
[1:41:42] appear not until you went into sickness
[1:41:46] did the healer appear not until you went
[1:41:49] to financial ruin
[1:41:51] did the provider appear not until
[1:41:54] amen not until you lost loved ones not
[1:41:56] until
[1:41:57] not until you were in distress that the
[1:41:59] comforter show up not until you were
[1:42:01] absolutely down to the last wire when
[1:42:03] there was nothing left of yourself that
[1:42:05] the el shaddai show up
[1:42:06] amen god allows these things to show
[1:42:08] himself amen god allows these things to
[1:42:10] prove his word
[1:42:11] but it's god doing it friends
[1:42:15] god's doing it why
[1:42:18] he wants to see your reaction he wants
[1:42:21] the
[1:42:21] the life to be made manifest
[1:42:27] it was daniel had purposed in his heart
[1:42:29] that he not defiled himself with the
[1:42:30] things of the world and he was forced
[1:42:32] through a trial
[1:42:32] whether he'd pray to god or go to the
[1:42:34] lion's den but it was after the heat was
[1:42:36] put on and he was thrown into a lion
[1:42:37] then that after that
[1:42:38] he saw the angel of the lord standing in
[1:42:40] the midst of him keeping away
[1:42:42] that great pillar of fire standing
[1:42:44] between him and the lions
[1:42:45] and the lions could not get him because
[1:42:46] he went through the trials and
[1:42:48] temptations and troubles
[1:42:49] he knew that his god was able to deliver
[1:42:51] him from that
[1:42:53] it was abraham after he'd seen the
[1:42:54] ground get barren and the drought come
[1:42:56] and lot separate himself and go down to
[1:42:58] live deliciously in the world
[1:43:00] it was after he had heard the whines and
[1:43:02] cries of his herdsmen with no grass for
[1:43:03] his cattle
[1:43:04] but he maintained the land that god gave
[1:43:06] him and told him to sojourn in
[1:43:08] and as on that day after he'd been tried
[1:43:11] to his patience was at the end
[1:43:13] it was on that day that when after the
[1:43:14] trial was over he spoke face to face
[1:43:16] with elohim
[1:43:17] under the oak that day it was after he'd
[1:43:20] suffered his trials after he went
[1:43:21] through the troubles that he'd been
[1:43:23] through that god
[1:43:24] appeared to him in a form of a man and
[1:43:26] sat there and told him he was married
[1:43:27] and his wife's name was sarah
[1:43:29] and said she laughed at him in the tent
[1:43:30] it was there that abraham called him
[1:43:32] elohim
[1:43:32] it was after the trial in tribulation
[1:43:36] oh if the church could only wake to
[1:43:38] itself today to find that after the
[1:43:40] troubles and trials
[1:43:41] and laughs and made fun of the things
[1:43:43] the church has been through
[1:43:44] the pentecostal church that was that we
[1:43:46] see god in our midst doing great signs
[1:43:49] and wonders
[1:43:51] all these great men that would take much
[1:43:53] of our morning service to go in to
[1:43:54] mention
[1:43:55] that they went through trials and saw
[1:43:58] god
[1:43:58] they went through trials and saw angels
[1:44:00] they went through trials revelations and
[1:44:02] saw signs and wonders and things but oh
[1:44:04] none of them saw what job saw all of the
[1:44:07] men after seeing angels and seeing god
[1:44:09] and all these things
[1:44:10] they never saw nothing give them hope
[1:44:12] beyond the grave but job saw
[1:44:14] the resurrection he saw easter he saw
[1:44:16] the thing that comforts every heart
[1:44:18] then when he did oh that the words would
[1:44:20] be printed in a book oh that they would
[1:44:22] be engraved with iron pen
[1:44:24] on a rock why because i know that my
[1:44:27] redeemer liveth
[1:44:28] and though the skin worms destroy this
[1:44:30] flesh but in my flesh yet will i see him
[1:44:35] all of these things friends are ordained
[1:44:37] of god the situations that you come
[1:44:39] through were ordained of god
[1:44:41] their mom and dad's situation whether
[1:44:43] you even had a mom or dad it was
[1:44:44] ordained by god
[1:44:45] amen god is manifesting himself in this
[1:44:48] world
[1:44:48] amen through his seed and his seed is
[1:44:51] overcoming every obstacle by the word
[1:44:53] the word will overcome everything that
[1:44:55] you've ever faced everything that you've
[1:44:57] ever been through the word will overcome
[1:44:58] it friends
[1:44:59] it's the word that will give you victory
[1:45:01] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:45:02] world
[1:45:03] even our faith our faith that's in what
[1:45:07] faith in the sanctuary of the word of
[1:45:09] god
[1:45:10] faith on the firm foundation of the word
[1:45:12] why does he let these things come
[1:45:14] why is it coming to you to prove you
[1:45:19] why was elizabeth barren all those years
[1:45:22] so god could prove that he could open a
[1:45:24] womb
[1:45:27] why did the three hebrew children go to
[1:45:29] the fire furnace so he could show
[1:45:31] himself as a deliverer
[1:45:33] a friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:45:35] brother why did the things happen in
[1:45:37] your life
[1:45:38] the thing that you scratched your head
[1:45:39] over all your life why did this happen
[1:45:41] he did it to prove you he did it to
[1:45:44] prove
[1:45:45] himself it was when they were in the
[1:45:49] fiery furnace
[1:45:50] that they saw the son of god it was when
[1:45:53] daniel was in the
[1:45:54] lions then he saw the pillar of fire
[1:45:56] amen it's when you've been through your
[1:45:57] darkest hour that you've seen a
[1:45:59] deliverer
[1:46:00] it's when you've been down to the last
[1:46:02] wire when sickness has got you wrung out
[1:46:04] amen when disease has taken its toll
[1:46:06] that you've come to your last hour that
[1:46:08] you see god
[1:46:09] how many people have come come amen
[1:46:12] through the prayer line
[1:46:13] brother branham they are the last
[1:46:14] moments the last moments before they die
[1:46:17] and god is showing i can heal cancer i
[1:46:19] can heal epilepsy
[1:46:20] i can heal they had to have it so he
[1:46:22] could show that he could heal it
[1:46:24] there had to be impossible for doctors
[1:46:26] to heal people had to come to situations
[1:46:28] that were impossible for doctors to heal
[1:46:30] so that god could show in this day that
[1:46:32] he could heal impossible situations
[1:46:34] and if that was god's lot for me if he
[1:46:36] wanted me to be the one
[1:46:38] that got down to 50 pounds amen had no
[1:46:40] more moisture in my body
[1:46:41] couldn't even blink my eyes because i
[1:46:43] was so close to death if god wanted me
[1:46:45] there so that he could show his mighty
[1:46:46] power
[1:46:47] then i say let me be there whatever god
[1:46:50] desires is what i want for my life
[1:46:52] whatever is proportioned to his counsel
[1:46:54] amen according to his pleasure
[1:46:56] that's what i want if he wants me to go
[1:46:59] through dark ages and dark nights and
[1:47:01] suffer
[1:47:02] i'll suffer for him because if i suffer
[1:47:04] i shall reign
[1:47:07] we get the wrong idea of christianity
[1:47:08] get the wrong idea of the message
[1:47:10] just because the profit could come and
[1:47:12] cancer could be healed
[1:47:13] and diabetes could be healed and
[1:47:15] epilepsy could be healed
[1:47:16] we think that he was here just to
[1:47:18] deliver us from all of our troubles
[1:47:19] that's not what he came for
[1:47:21] that's not what the word came for the
[1:47:22] word came to call out the seed
[1:47:28] god wants to use you
[1:47:32] that thing that you've suffered with all
[1:47:34] your life because it happened to me when
[1:47:35] i was a child and it never should have
[1:47:37] happened
[1:47:38] can the word overcome that
[1:47:42] see remember when we come to the
[1:47:45] revelation of the hour into that
[1:47:47] clorox bleach where does the sin go
[1:47:52] back on the head of the one who
[1:47:54] originated it
[1:47:56] in heaven now he's bearing the iniquity
[1:48:00] for it
[1:48:00] not me now he's holding the blame
[1:48:05] not me
[1:48:08] god has a desire
[1:48:11] to defeat the devil
[1:48:15] i want you to listen real close for just
[1:48:16] a minute
[1:48:18] god has a desire this whole life
[1:48:22] is planned by god for a purpose
[1:48:26] the fall in the garden was planned by
[1:48:28] god
[1:48:30] whatever happened before and we find the
[1:48:32] earth
[1:48:33] void and without form it's in a form of
[1:48:35] judgment and god has judged it for
[1:48:37] whatever reason we don't understand
[1:48:38] we know there's been a war that broke
[1:48:40] out in heaven and and
[1:48:42] and and that war now is going to spill
[1:48:44] on the earth in the garden of eden and
[1:48:46] god
[1:48:46] creates a paradise and he puts his
[1:48:48] children there he gives them his word
[1:48:49] and he knows that they're going to fall
[1:48:51] he created them in such a way that they
[1:48:52] were able to fall
[1:48:55] why because he does it all by his own
[1:48:57] counsel according to his pleasure he
[1:49:00] can't make him fall
[1:49:01] but he sets him up in a situation where
[1:49:02] he knows that they'll fall
[1:49:04] why because there's something he's got
[1:49:06] to accomplish
[1:49:08] there's something god wants to do in
[1:49:09] this life he wants to manifest himself
[1:49:12] he wants to be known he wants to be
[1:49:14] proved he wants to be demonstrated in
[1:49:16] mighty power as a mighty conqueror
[1:49:18] so he's got to let things fall into ruin
[1:49:21] so that he can be a conqueror
[1:49:23] and see the devil takes the battle
[1:49:26] from heaven and he brings it down to
[1:49:28] earth now remember when we first started
[1:49:30] in the seals we showed
[1:49:31] that the false vine started in heaven
[1:49:33] but the false vine will have an
[1:49:35] end
[1:49:38] there's judgment coming to the false
[1:49:40] vine
[1:49:41] now think friends think with me
[1:49:45] god has to stay righteous and holy
[1:49:48] and he has to work according to his own
[1:49:50] laws
[1:49:52] when war broke out in heaven he didn't
[1:49:54] just take the devil and kill him
[1:49:57] you wonder why why didn't he just
[1:49:59] absolutely destroy him
[1:50:01] he has the power to but god does
[1:50:03] everything according to his laws
[1:50:05] he does everything in justice
[1:50:08] and and so now god's got this plan and
[1:50:10] it's all working according to his plan
[1:50:12] he has a desire in his mind he has
[1:50:13] something he wants to accomplish
[1:50:15] and it's all working but now his seed
[1:50:18] would be sown into the earth friends
[1:50:20] and that seed would be tried and tested
[1:50:23] and persecuted but it would overcome
[1:50:25] every situation
[1:50:27] everything that the devil would put
[1:50:29] against it it would overcome
[1:50:31] the devil would try this it would
[1:50:32] overcome then he would try this and it
[1:50:34] would overcome
[1:50:35] there was nothing that the devil could
[1:50:36] do that the seed couldn't overcome
[1:50:39] see friends that's part of the plan
[1:50:42] that's part of the purpose
[1:50:43] you and i are soldiers in this bottom we
[1:50:46] have signed up for the army of the lord
[1:50:48] and there's two great forces fighting
[1:50:50] and it's christ and it's the devil and
[1:50:52] now we're on christ's side and we're
[1:50:54] attributes of christ
[1:50:55] and when we overcome we seal his doom
[1:50:59] when we take faith in the word overcome
[1:51:01] the situations
[1:51:02] we seal and signify his destruction
[1:51:06] god is depending on you and i
[1:51:09] this whole battle is depending on you
[1:51:11] and i if the devil can defeat
[1:51:13] one attribute of god he's defeated god
[1:51:16] if the devil can stop one son of god one
[1:51:20] expressed attribute
[1:51:21] that peace of the father that came off
[1:51:23] of the father that landed in your flesh
[1:51:25] whether you be 13 or 14 or 15 or a 17
[1:51:28] year old young man it doesn't matter
[1:51:29] where it falls
[1:51:30] if it falls in you if he can stop that
[1:51:32] defeat that seed move it to unbelief
[1:51:34] then he has beat god
[1:51:38] so where is the battle now
[1:51:43] right here if he can stop
[1:51:46] one part of god
[1:51:49] he stopped god
[1:51:53] if he can defeat one
[1:51:58] he's defeated god that's why he'll
[1:52:01] unleash every bit of tarot he's
[1:52:03] permitted to unleash against you
[1:52:04] he wants to stop one
[1:52:08] but if god can overcome
[1:52:14] he's defeated if the devil can win
[1:52:18] on one attribute god's defeated
[1:52:22] if all of the attributes of god can win
[1:52:27] he's destroyed now do you see where
[1:52:30] you're at
[1:52:31] do you see your part in the battle it's
[1:52:33] not about here or over there or over
[1:52:35] there
[1:52:36] it's about me the portion of god that's
[1:52:39] in me
[1:52:40] overcoming every obstacle and now you're
[1:52:43] going to stand as a witness on the day
[1:52:45] of judgment
[1:52:45] friends when somebody comes up and their
[1:52:48] judgment's not fair and said
[1:52:50] you just don't understand you don't
[1:52:52] understand your word wouldn't work i had
[1:52:54] no daddy to raise me you could stand and
[1:52:56] say i had no daddy to raise me and the
[1:52:57] word works
[1:53:00] but you don't understand i was neglected
[1:53:01] and abused as a child there'll be
[1:53:03] somebody that will be able to stand up
[1:53:04] and say
[1:53:05] i was neglected and abused as a child
[1:53:08] but the word works
[1:53:11] but you don't understand i lived in
[1:53:13] laodicea and you could stand up and say
[1:53:15] i lived in laodicea but you don't
[1:53:18] understand
[1:53:19] i mean the doctors told me there was no
[1:53:21] hope how could i have faith and you can
[1:53:22] stand up and say
[1:53:23] the doctors told me there was no home
[1:53:26] but i waited for 25 years for my healing
[1:53:29] abraham can stand and say i waited 25
[1:53:31] years for the promise of a baby
[1:53:34] see friends all these things has to be
[1:53:36] why so that god can destroy your enemy
[1:53:40] and he's allowing he's allowing you to
[1:53:42] fall into every situation imaginable
[1:53:45] because god's got to overcome the devil
[1:53:47] in every way
[1:53:48] you had a hateful dad you had an
[1:53:50] unloving mom you had no mom and dad
[1:53:52] you were abused you were beat up as a
[1:53:54] kid you were mocked and you laughed at
[1:53:56] god's going to overcome everything and
[1:53:58] the devil's going to be utterly defeated
[1:54:01] amen he didn't put you through that for
[1:54:03] you to be defeated and downtrodden and
[1:54:05] downcast all your life
[1:54:06] god has allowed his seed to come that
[1:54:08] way so that you can be an overcomer
[1:54:10] and you can be a witness on that day and
[1:54:12] you will stand there on that day when
[1:54:14] that final judgment is
[1:54:15] met out to lucifer himself and you will
[1:54:18] be a witness
[1:54:19] amen that he is defeated
[1:54:23] some through the fire some through the
[1:54:26] flood
[1:54:27] some through great trials but all
[1:54:29] through the blood
[1:54:32] see suffering is instrumental in
[1:54:34] defeating the devil
[1:54:37] things go wrong and you toss up your
[1:54:38] hands and say oh why is god
[1:54:40] oh it's just an opportunity for you to
[1:54:42] win again
[1:54:44] it's an opportunity for god to defeat
[1:54:46] the devil on one more battlefield
[1:54:48] and one more obstacle you were put here
[1:54:51] to be
[1:54:51] an overcomer when you read through
[1:54:53] genesis or revelations chapter two and
[1:54:56] three you read the church ages
[1:54:57] every every church age has a message
[1:54:59] message to the overcomers
[1:55:02] because every age has overcomers in this
[1:55:04] age will have overcomers too
[1:55:09] praise the lord what have you gone
[1:55:11] through in your life
[1:55:13] has it been unfair has it been
[1:55:15] unrighteous
[1:55:17] has it been terrible those all may be
[1:55:20] true
[1:55:21] but has it been for no purpose
[1:55:26] is it just suffering for no reason just
[1:55:28] to suffer
[1:55:29] does it make no sense i'm telling your
[1:55:32] friends it makes sense
[1:55:35] it's for a reason it's for a purpose the
[1:55:38] lamb is in complete control of your
[1:55:39] trial
[1:55:41] nothing's going to happen unless god
[1:55:44] has provided for you unless god has
[1:55:47] allowed it
[1:55:50] if you've been waiting 10 15 years to be
[1:55:52] healed keep waiting
[1:55:55] if you've been waiting for loved ones
[1:55:57] for 10 15 20 years keep waiting
[1:56:00] whatever you let faith have its final
[1:56:03] victory it doesn't matter what the test
[1:56:04] is
[1:56:07] jesus looked at peter one day said peter
[1:56:10] the devil desires as sifty as wheat
[1:56:14] he never said but i've stopped him
[1:56:18] the devil desires as sifty as we but you
[1:56:19] know i told him he's not allowed
[1:56:22] he permitted it why because peter had to
[1:56:26] come forth as gold
[1:56:28] all the gold that's locked down inside
[1:56:30] of you has to come forth
[1:56:32] some through the fire some through the
[1:56:35] flood
[1:56:36] some through great trials but all
[1:56:38] through the blood
[1:56:40] the seals are here friends not just to
[1:56:42] unlock the mystery of the church ages
[1:56:44] but it's unlocked the mystery of your
[1:56:46] life
[1:56:48] we have to stop thinking as victims
[1:56:50] we're not victims
[1:56:52] how can god's attribute be victimized
[1:56:55] how can how can god's children be
[1:56:57] victims in this world
[1:56:59] amen god is just setting the devil up
[1:57:01] for destruction
[1:57:03] do you think jesus when jesus stood
[1:57:06] before pilate
[1:57:07] and his visage was so marred above any
[1:57:09] man that he could not be recognized as a
[1:57:11] man
[1:57:12] they had ripped his beard out they had
[1:57:13] put a crown of thorns on his head they
[1:57:15] had beat him 39 times with a web
[1:57:17] do you think he was downcast
[1:57:21] do you think he was defeated do you
[1:57:23] think he was pitiful
[1:57:25] do you think he was sorry do you think
[1:57:28] god felt sorry for him
[1:57:30] the scripture says it pleased god to
[1:57:32] bruise him
[1:57:36] every time they beat him the devil was
[1:57:39] getting that much closer to defeat
[1:57:42] every stripe that they put on his back
[1:57:46] was for my healing every stripe
[1:57:50] was victory over the devil every time
[1:57:53] they mocked him
[1:57:54] victory over the devil when they took
[1:57:56] him and they nailed him to the cross
[1:57:58] amen before that when they rejected him
[1:57:59] they called him up and he said behold
[1:58:01] thy king
[1:58:01] and they rejected him and they wanted a
[1:58:03] murderer instead he was getting victory
[1:58:05] god was winning every step of the way
[1:58:09] every blow every strike every situation
[1:58:12] god was defeating the devil and the same
[1:58:15] thing's true in your life
[1:58:16] every affliction you go through every
[1:58:18] bit of torment from the devil every
[1:58:20] demon that oppresses you he's going to
[1:58:22] be utterly defeated
[1:58:24] every time he comes against you you're
[1:58:25] going to have victory every time he
[1:58:27] afflicts you you're going to win
[1:58:29] god is going to prove that the seed will
[1:58:31] come through indestructible
[1:58:32] undefeated amen it'll never be defeated
[1:58:40] when they went through the trials they
[1:58:41] saw angels they had revelations
[1:58:44] it was the affliction that bought the
[1:58:45] manifestation when they were in the
[1:58:47] fiery furnace they saw the
[1:58:48] they saw the son of god when they were
[1:58:50] in the lions then they saw
[1:58:52] the angel of the lord the pillar of fire
[1:58:54] all these things happened when they
[1:58:56] needed to happen friends
[1:58:58] but there's another time of pressure
[1:59:00] coming upon the bride
[1:59:02] called the squeeze what a little produce
[1:59:07] the spoken word manifestation of god
[1:59:10] we're not afraid of those things it's
[1:59:12] the final destruction of the devil from
[1:59:14] the bride age
[1:59:15] is his final loosing of his powers the
[1:59:18] final defeat of him
[1:59:19] and we're not afraid to face it friends
[1:59:21] when persecution comes when trials come
[1:59:23] when mocking and scourging
[1:59:25] when they close this church you better
[1:59:26] get excited because all the pressure
[1:59:28] will do
[1:59:29] is manifest the son of god again and the
[1:59:31] pressure will come and it will squeeze
[1:59:33] down
[1:59:33] and it'll tighten up and persecution
[1:59:35] will come and god will manifest himself
[1:59:37] again
[1:59:38] you think god's going to stop it he's
[1:59:39] not going to stop it he's already
[1:59:41] prophesied it's coming
[1:59:42] he won't stop it but what will he do he
[1:59:44] will use it
[1:59:45] for a great manifestation of himself
[1:59:47] again
[1:59:49] and we will see the lord high and lifted
[1:59:51] up
[1:59:52] in the in the in in christ is the
[1:59:55] mystery of god revealed he says then
[1:59:57] they've laughed at her they've mocked
[1:59:59] her the churches have rejected her but
[2:00:01] then he'll take her and lift her up here
[2:00:03] and say this was her
[2:00:05] and then away he'll go with him what's
[2:00:08] he going to do
[2:00:09] trap the devil by his own devices when
[2:00:12] they were crucifying jesus
[2:00:14] he was trapping the devil by his own
[2:00:16] devices
[2:00:17] and when he's afflicting you god is

[2:00:35] the earth in this age that the word

[2:00:51] the greatest revelation of the third
[2:00:53] seal to me
[2:00:55] is that the lamb's in control of it all
[2:00:58] when you slip into your dark ages and
[2:01:00] everything around you is dark
[2:01:02] the lamb's in absolute control he's put
[2:01:05] limits he's put boundaries
[2:01:07] and that's only there so he can be made
[2:01:09] manifest

[2:01:14] thank you lord for this day and for this
[2:01:15] word

[2:01:37] had to be afflicted

[2:01:40] and let the dove of your holy spirit coo
[2:01:42] in their ear
[2:01:43] and reveal to them that it has to be
[2:01:46] this way
[2:01:47] so that you can get victory over the
[2:01:49] devil
[2:01:51] so that the end of the age is when the
[2:01:53] lucifer is taken and cast into the lake
[2:01:55] of fire and annihilated completely
