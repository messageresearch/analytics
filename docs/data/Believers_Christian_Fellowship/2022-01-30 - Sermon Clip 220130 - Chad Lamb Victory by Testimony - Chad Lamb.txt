========================================

when paul says that the circumcision we have now is the circumcision of the heart not of the flesh where did moses say that but when paul wrote that letter amen the believers in that day they didn't say well let's take paul's letter that he wrote and then all the parts that we can find in the scripture will keep but the parts that we can't find in the scripture we won't keep paul's letter was the scriptures we read the bible and when we read the bible we're reading a letter that a church age messenger and a prophet of god wrote to a church in corinth wrote to a church in ephesus wrote to a church and he wrote it to the church and that day they had to receive it by faith having faith in who that man was [Applause] they didn't know that what they got was the scripture we look back and we say when paul says it that's thus saith the lord is that right when paul says amen if paul says this in the scripture it's thus saith the lord if paul says this is the way you do it in the church that's the way you do it in the church if paul says amen you don't stumble on brother you don't stumble a brother if paul says whatever paul says in those letters is the way we do it is thus saith the lord [Music] and we look back and say well obviously what else would they say it's the bible it wasn't the bible in their day [Applause] [Music] and paul was bringing things that put him absolutely contrary to the pharisees because he was saying things amen that you could not find direct correlation for in the scripture but paul was pulling out grace out of the law and he was establishing grace it was all the way through the bible but they couldn't see it but paul could see it by revelation and he would begin to take basing it on the entire bible he wrote this letter [Music] and they may not have been able to say what he said here oh that's deuteronomy xyz but when he wrote that letter that was thus saith the lord to that church and there were skeptics in paul's day there were skeptics who would say you know where does he get this no physical circumcision that's not anywhere in the bible there were a group of judaizers that were going around amen behind paul to the churches that paul established and they were they were bringing back law bringing back circumcision this is what the book of galatians is all about and they were skeptical of paul's writing because they believed paul had moved them away from the scriptures and they were trying to bring them back to the scriptures not knowing that paul was writing the scriptures
