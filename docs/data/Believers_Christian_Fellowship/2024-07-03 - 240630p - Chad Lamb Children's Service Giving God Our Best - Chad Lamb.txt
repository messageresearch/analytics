pray before we get started dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord You're so mindful of us and love us so much and we're so thankful we can be here together in this special service that we set aside for the children amongst us God we know that when you were here Lord the disciples thought that you might be too busy and under too much pressure to be bothered with the children but you rebuked them and you said suffer the little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and Lord You've showed us that you took the children into your arms and you picked them up and you bless

in their lives today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can all sit down alrighty so is my first slide up all right we've got lots of pictures and some videos that we're going to go through today we're going to do a lesson on giving God our best and we're going to learn about uh somebody in the story called Blind bmas has anybody heard about blind raise your hand if you've heard about blind barus all right some of you had by the time we're done we'll all know about blind bmas because we're going to read about it and learn about it so we're going to start with this scripture that says we love him because he first loved us so who loved who first Who Loved You did you love Jesus first or did he love you first the Bible says he loved you first we love him because he Lov us first and so our love to him is just something we give back to him because he loved us first so we're going to learn today like I said about blind barnas I'm going to read a couple scriptures that talk about barnas and the scriptures and barnas was a blind man meaning he could not see he had no vision brother benam says some things about uh barus that we're going to learn together that's interesting he tells us more about his life and his background but barname wasn't born blind according to what the brother M told us that he could see when he was a little boy but something happened somewhere along the way and he lost his vision and now he could no longer see and and and there's a whole story behind it we're going to learn about that but here's what we know about him in the scriptures from uh The Book of Mark chapter 10 says and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bmus the son of tus Sat by the highways side begging and when he he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many he charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of David have mercy on me so we find out here that he's in Jericho and in Jericho it says that he was blind and also he was begging that means a a blind man in that day couldn't have a job he couldn't go out and do the kind of work that that they needed to do in that day so his only option was to beg and asked people to give him money out of the kindness of their heart and he was a beggar begging by the walls of Jericho but he heard that Jesus was passing by and inside he knew that this Jesus Son of David could help him so he started crying out and as he cried out for Jesus to help him the people nearby told him to be quiet but he wouldn't be quiet he cried out the more that s thing Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and then and Jesus answered and said unto him what will thou that I should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way now how exciting would that be can you imagine uh you all can see right you all can see me right you can see you know how wonderful it is to be able to see can you imagine if you wake up tomorrow and you couldn't see you couldn't see anything you couldn't see the sunrise the flowers you couldn't see Mom and Dad you couldn't see anything can you imagine you live your whole life like that but then one day Jesus passes by and as Jesus passes by you cry out and Jesus said to you what would you want me to do for you and you said Lord that I could see and he says your faith has made you whole and immediately he could see again do you know how exciting that would be that would be a thrill he would go home he would tell his family he would show everybody that he can see now and that's the story in the Bible of barus but it's beautiful that God gave us a prophet today that would tell us a little more we can go and listen to what brother Venom said and we get a little more of the story and here's what he here's what he said he said I read the history of blind barus one day a little story they said that he had been blind for years and he had a little daughter he had never seen apparently his little daughter was born after he lost his eyesight he never seen her face never knew what she looked like but he had a little daughter and it goes on to say he had two little turtle does and they would do little tumbles like that to attract the tourist attention going into Jerusalem or into the City and they would drop coins into his cup because he was blind so brother R said he had two little turtle does and because bmus couldn't go to work to earn money for his family he had a wife and he had a little girl and they had to buy their groceries they had to get the things that they needed to live and their clothes and things so what little uh uh what barus would do is he would sit in the corner of the street as people were passing by and he had little two little turtle does that would do that would do tricks he said they would tumble over one another and brother B said it this way he said uh blind barus had had two little tur Turtle does that turned little tumbles over each other and they would attract the attention of the passer by so this is how he would get money not just begging but he would do a little show with his little birds so that the people would be attracted Ed and they'd come over and they'd like what they seen and they would drop a few coins in his little cup and you want to see the the birds tumble I looked this up and I found this is a pigeon this is a tumbling pigeon and this is what it looks like this is played in slow motion so you can see what it's like it's getting ready to take off and look at that have you ever seen a bird do a backflip it's amazing these are called Tumblr pinons there's actually a thing they breed them and they have them and they tumble and and brother benam said that bmus had two of these little turtle doves and and they would tumble over one another and he would let them go and they would do a little show and he'd throw them in the air and they tumble over each other and then they would come back to him and that's why people would stop and watch his little show and and then he would ask them for something and they would drop a little bit of money into his thing and that's how he would earn his money and that's what he was doing to earn money but then brother Brenham says something he gives us some more information and he tells us that he had a little daughter remember he said he had a little daughter that he had never seen he said uh uh and he had a wife and and this is where brother said he said that one night bame's wife took real sick and he went along the side of the house and knelt down after the doctor had left and said that he didn't know what to do for her and he prayed to God and he said Lord if you'll just let my dear precious wife get well I promise you that I will take these two Turtle does and offer them to you for a sacrifice and it says his wife got well so here he is he's blind he he has no job he has very little he's got these two little turtle doves that he does this little show with to get a few coins so that they could live and and they're precious to him but he's also got a precious wife and a precious daughter and his wife wife got real sick like she was going to die and he didn't know what to do so he just prayed oh God will he just save my wife's life if she'll live I'll give you my two little doves and and it said that they lived that she lived and and so he took his two little turtle does and he took them up to the temple to give them to God and he would give them to the priest and the priest would offer them to God and now he would no longer have his Turtle does the the thing that he made his money by the little show that he had that would get him a few coins he gave it to God because he was so thankful for what God did for his wife he was so happy that his wife was alive that he made a pledge to God and he wanted to give God the very best that he have he didn't give him one of the old coins that somebody dropped in there but he gave him something that was precious to him he gave him these two little turtle doves and now he has no way to make his money he has no little show he has no tumbling uh uh doves to entertain the people or attract their attention so now all he can do is beg and just ask them to please give him money so it gets worse for him but then brother Brenham goes on to tell us something else about barus that I didn't know he said he said he used to go up there and sit on the street he had a little lamb and the lamb used to lead the blind people like the dogs does today the dogs that lead the blind they had a lamb trained to do that to lead the blind and he says in another place he said also in this day we find that a blind person is led by a dog that's trained to take them across the street and and brother Ben says I forget what you call that he says seeing ey in those days instead of having a train dog they had a trained sheep that led them have you ever seen a dog lead a blind person a seeing eye dog I got a little video of it so you can watch and see these These are amazing dogs they're trained to help blind people move around the city so here's a little story about a a little seeing ey dog I'm finally living my dream I'm not like any ordinary pet I'm a guide dog I work with a blind partner helping him throughout his day crossing streets navigating sidewalks going around obstacles and running errands we work together to accomplish all of this but to be sure we remain safe I need to stay focused on my work at all times that's why I'm trained to ignore other dogs stopping to play with them would be really distracting and that could be dangerous for my partner and me please help us stay safe remember to keep your dog away from me when I'm at work wow it's pretty nice dog isn't it and brother B said they have dogs that do that now but back in that they D dogs they used a little lamb they would have a little lamb or a sheep that would guide them to keep them from walking down a set the steps or falling off of a a hill or bumping into something they would just have this little lamb and this little sheep would guide them because he couldn't see with his eyes so he had he had things that helped him when he was blind one was his two little turtle doves that he could earn money by but he gave those to God for saving the life of his wife then he had this little lamb that he loved and if you were blind then this little lamb LED you around that would be a pretty important lamb to you wouldn't it what if you were blind and had a seeing ey dog that would be a pretty important dog you wouldn't want to leave the house without it because you could fall off the stairs you could trip over something you could bump into somebody you could walk out into traffic and get hit by a car this little dog was was the little dog was helping the blind but in barnabas' day it was the little lamb that was helping him and so it was precious and valuable and really a good help to him but brother random goes on to tell us he says sometime later that his little daughter got sick so remember the most precious things to barnas was his little turtle does his little seeing ey lamb his wife and his little girl his wife had already got sick but God saved her and in Thanksgiving he offered God his two little turtle does but now his little girl is sick one of the most precious things in the world to him he says sometime later his little girl daughter got sick very seriously ill with a fever and he went out to the side of the house again and prayed and said Lord I don't have nothing left but my lamb if you just let me my baby live I promise you that I'll take my lamb and give it as a sacrifice upon the Altar and as a little story goes his daughter got well and on his road to the church to offer the sacrifice he met the priest and he says where are you going blind bmas and here goes blind bmus up to the temple carrying his little lamb because what was the promise he made God if you'll save my little girl I'll give you my lamb and here he goes happy because his little girl lived happy to give God the very best sacrifice he can give him cuz he's so thankful that his girl is alive that he takes something that's so precious to him and so meaningful and the most precious thing he has outside of his wife and his daughter is this little lamb and he's taking it up to give the very best Thanksgiving offering he can to God is his little lamb and he meets a priest and the priest tries to change his mind and here's what he says the priest said uh he said priest I go to the Temple of the Lord to give my lamb to God and the priest said barname thou cannot give your lamb the lamb is your eyes he said I'll give you money to buy a lamb you go to the Stalls and buy a lamb and offer it because the lamb is your eyes so what the priest was telling him is when you go to the temple because they would offer lambs and they would offer doves all the time to God back in that Day in Israel they that's what their offering was to God that's what they would give and they would have people that had little stalls set up outside the temple and you can go take some money buy a lamb take the lamb give it to the priest and the priest will give it to God and that would be their sacrifice and the priest says don't give this lamb to God this lamb is your eyes you need it to walk around you need this lamb uh he says don't do that I'll give you you some money and you just go up there to the temple and buy a lamb and just give a lamb to God and barus wouldn't do it he says no I didn't just promise God a lamb I promised him my lamb I promised that I would give him the very best thing that I have and and barus said I'm grateful thank you for your kindness that you're showing me but I'm going to offer this lamb to God and then he tried again he says but you can't do that because this lamb is your eyes' and he said oh servant of God this is bamus now he says I will I will keep my promise to God God will provide a lamb for my eyes he knew that if I just in Thanksgiving give God my best God will take care of me God's already taken care of him he's already saved his wife's life he already saved his little girl's life and baramas is so thankful he wants to give something of Great Value to God not something cheap not one of the coins somebody drops in his cup not the money the priest would give him to go buy another lamb but he wants to give the very best gift he can give to God and that very best gift is his own lamb and so he walks up there with the lamb and he and he gives it he gives it to God and now he has to go to begging and he has no turtle doves he has no lamb he's got to you find his way around the street without a seeing ey lamb to guide him probably he would imagine miss the lamb all the time as he would bump into something or or or run into a wall or maybe trip over something that the lamb would have taken him around fall into a a shallow hole and all of a sudden now he's missing this lamb but he thanks God because he's got his little girl and he's got his wife and God's been so good to him and brother bam tells us the story of bmus he says he's sitting by the walls of Jericho this is the day that Jesus comes by and this is what he's thinking about so he began to think of something like this how that when he was a little boy out there on the hills of J Judea the little yellow flowers and how he used to go out as a little child and he would pick those little flowers how pretty they were and especially when they were just coming up in the spring and how he would see the blue skies and would wonder how far it was up to the skies but since that day his sight's been shut off from such so he was sitting there at Jericho remembering what it was like when he was a little boy to see the pretty flowers and the blue skies and then he begins to remember about being a child and he remembers great things of his childhood of how his beautiful little Jewish mother used to get him up in her arms after his midday lunch and would sat out on the front porch and rock him and get get him to take his nap and tell him Bible stories of the great Jehovah God that how God had led their people out of the bondage of Egypt and had brought them into a great land that they lived and he just loved to hear those stories and one that he liked so well was to think when just down at the bottom of the hill at the Ford there was where the Jehovah God rolled back the Jordan and held it up at a standstill until the mighty Joshua and his marching Army of Israel crossed over he loved those stories of the power of God then there was another one there was another one that he liked real well in the Bible it was told about a woman and she was a shunamite woman and she had a little boy such as he was and oh how his mama would tell him these stories and his little eyes would snap as they looked her in the pretty face he was remembering about all the great stories of the Bible all the wonderful things that God had done but as he's sitting there up against the wall with no lamb and no doves and begging for some coins all of a sudden he hears a great crowd coming and the crowd is making a lot of noise and he's wondering what is all this noise about and somebody tells him that Jesus is coming Jesus the son of David is coming and and maybe he had heard some things about Jesus and when they told him the son of David is coming all of a sudden he gets excited because he's just thinking about all the great things that God did in the Bible how he brought them out of Egypt how he made the water stand up in the Red Sea so they could draw cross on dry ground how they stopped the water from flowing in Jordan so they could cross all these wonderful things and now he begins to cry out and he says Thou son of David have mercy on me son son of David have mercy on me and they try to get him to be quiet but he won't be quiet he keeps screaming oh son of David Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and then Jesus stops Jesus stops he heard his cry and brother man tells us there was so many people crying there was noise everywhere they were saying uh all kinds of things about Jesus coming there was a great crowd but through all the noise Jesus heard heard the voice of blind bardus crying thou son of David have mercy and he stops and he bids him to come and and they tell him with excitement he's calling for you and they bring him to Jesus and Jesus says what is it that you want he asked what what can I do for you he said Lord that I might see and here's what brother BM said he said that I might receive my sight and he said why your faith has already made you whole what was it God had provided a lamb for blind barus who was the lamb Jesus was the lamb Jesus knew what barame is needed and there's no time ever that you can give something to God that God won't take care of you amen he gave up his turtle doves now he has no income he gave up his lamb he has no way to find his way around but Jesus already knew what he was going to do for barus barus the god provided a lamb for bame's eyes and that lamb was Jesus Christ because Jesus was going to give his life for the sins of the world so that we all could have life and now Jesus comes along and barus cries out and God doesn't forget what barus did he doesn't forget about the doves and he doesn't forget about the Lambs but he hears his cry amongst all the cries that were going on he hears this one who loved him so much that he gave his best loved him so much that was so thankful to God that He gave everything he had and God now comes to him and gives him back what what barname could never have beli could never have received his sight now he could see he could go home and see his lovely wife's face he could go home and see his little daughter that he had never seen before because Jesus came by God had provided for barnas a lamb not one that would lead him around blind but one that would open his eyes so that he would never stumble around blind again amen there's another story that Jesus tells his disciples it's this story here he says and Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury that's the offering basket there was an offering set up in the temple where when people come in they would give an offering to God and that's the treasury and many there were Rich cast in much and there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in two mites and which make a farthing and he called unto his disciples and saith unto them verily I say unto you that this poor Widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living here we have a a little widow she has nothing and while Jesus was there all the rich people were coming in and maybe they would bring out big bags of money like this full of gold coins and they wanted everybody to see see how much they give so they would open it up and they'd make a lot of noise as they shook it out so everybody could see they gave a lot of money and the Bible says they gave much but they had much they had tons and tons of money so they would take some of their money and they would give and they wanted everybody to see what they had but the way brother B tells us the story is this little widow she didn't have bags of money she didn't have gold coins she didn't have anything she had two little coins and that's all she had and she took her two little coins and she didn't make any noise she didn't say hey look at me she didn't she didn't rattle the coins together all she did was slip up there and she just dropped in her coins for nobody to see because she was a little bit embarrassed that she didn't have as much as everybody else had can you imagine if you're going to the treasury and everybody is blowing a trumpet announcing that I'm coming to give my offering and they shake out hundreds and hundreds of coins into the treasury and everybody can see it falling and they're smiling as everybody's looking at them I'm giving so much to God can you imagine how embarrassed the woman was while she just looked down at these two little coin she had in her hand she didn't have big bags of money she didn't have anything but this is all she had so when nobody was looking when nobody was paying attention she slipped over to the treasury and she dropped her little coins in and moved away because she couldn't she couldn't do anything special like everybody else did she didn't have anything special she didn't have much so she slipped in she dropped it and then she slipped away but guess who saw it who did the Bible say saw that somebody want to guess God God saw it you're right Jesus was standing there and Jesus got the attention of his disciples and said you see this little woman you see all the money all these people are putting in they this little woman gave more money than they did and they were put bags of money in she just had two coins but Jesus saw that they gave because they had much to give she gave everything she had this was this was like bame's two Turtle does and his little lamb everything she didn't give she didn't have a pocket full of money and she just pulled out one coin and gave it she emptied her pocket of everything and dropped it in and you know who saw it Jesus saw it Jesus saw it because she gave her best to God and Jesus made no and she's mentioned in the Bible and God said she gave more than anybody else because she gave her best when we give something to God it doesn't it it doesn't matter how fancy it is or compared to how much somebody else gives but when we give to God our very best God knows how much we gave he knows we gave our best the others weren't giving their best they were just giving a little bit if you have a million dollars and you give a couple dollars that's not much if all you've got is $2 and you give that you gave everything so she gave all but there was somebody else who gave something to God that was very precious and they gave all and it was Abraham back in the Book of Genesis God tests Abraham and he tells Abraham take thy son thine only son and take it and offer your son to me as a sacrifice give me your son and this boy was everything to Abraham Abraham had received the promise from God 25 years before he was born that he was going to have a son and that he would have a son by his wife Sarah and here comes the son little Isaac and little Isaac is the the most precious thing that Abraham has in the world and God tests him and says Abraham why don't you give me your son and Abraham doesn't hesitate he he immediately he gets too servants and they saddle up their donkey and they start the long trip to mount Mariah cuz he's going to give his son to God and and he goes up on top of the mountain and we know Isaac is there and Isaac is carrying the wood and they're walking up and at the end of The Journey there's no more servants it's just Abraham and just his his little lamb his precious son his most valuable thing and he's taking it up to give it to God and they go up and they make the altar for the sacrifice and they lay Isaac down and everything's there and he's just about to give Isaac to God completely when the angel the Lord stops him and says Abraham stop and this is what he said and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son for me and all of a sudden when when Abraham was going to give his very best gift that he could possibly give to God God sees the heart of Abraham and he stops him and he says stop now I know that you love me and does anybody remember what God gives Abraham instead of Isaac yes he gives him a lamb he gives him a Ram with his horns stop uh stuck in the thicket all of a sudden brother bham said they had been up on top of the mountain and the mountain was Bare it's not a mountain with trees it was just Rocky on top and they could see forever and they gathered a bunch of rocks and they had they had made an altar and they stacked it all up they had worked for quite a while and while they were there there was no other animals there there was nothing there just Abraham and his son and they piled the Rocks up and they piled the wood up and they did everything and then Abraham goes to offer his own precious dear son and then all of a sudden God says stop and When God says stop he says now I know that thou love me and as soon as he said stop he turned and looked and this is what he saw there was a a ram a lamb a sheep with his horn stuck in the vine stuck in the bush and he couldn't get out and God saw what Abraham was doing and God now gave a lamb to Abraham to use as a substitute for Isaac now he didn't have to give Isaac to God now he could take the lamb that God provided and he could give the lamb back to God and now Isaac could live and Isaac could stay with his dad see it's important that we give our best to God but if we give our best to God he gives his best to us and he's already given us the best thing he could give us because God has already given us a lamb in Abraham's day he had to be tested whether or not he would give the very best you know barus he gave his very best everything he had to God and God saw it he get it because he was thankful to God because he loved God but God saw it and God gave him his sight back the two the woman with the two little MIT and two little coins she gave the very best she had and God saw it and he mentioned it in the Bible Abraham gave the very best his own son he gave it to God and God saw it and God gave Abraham a lamb that he could use instead but God knew that we needed saved that we needed life and so God gave us his lamb Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God and God gave a lamb instead of us do you know Abraham's son was Isaac and Isaac was going to be offered as a sacrifice but God gave a lamb with his horn stuck in the thicket instead it was a substitute now instead of Isaac give the lamb and Isaac can live well you know what God did he gave Jesus on top of the mountain and Jesus is the Lamb that was given for me you remember when you sang Father Abraham a few minutes ago Father Abraham had many sons I am one of them and so are you you know what the Bible says that if we have the faith of Abraham if we believe God like Abraham then we're children of Abraham so we're children of Abraham like Isaac was a child of Abraham and Isaac was going to be given as a sacrifice on the altar but God said nope I'll give you a lamb instead and Isaac can go free and now we're children of Abraham and you know what God has done he's provided Jesus Christ in our place now he becomes the lamb so we can go free man I don't know about you but that makes me very thankful you know what it makes me want to do it makes me want to give God my best when when Bemus knew that his wife was going to live he gave God his best as a thank you when he found out his little girl who was so sick that she might die when he found out that she was going to live you know what he did he gave his very best as a thank you but you know what because of sin because of failure because of the mistakes that were made and what we all make we had to die we couldn't live forever we couldn't live because of our sin because of our failure because we would lie because we would do all kinds of wrong things but God made a way that we could live we could live we could live forever we could have eternal life we could go back to God but somebody had to give a gift and it was God and he gave his lamb up just like baramas gave his and his lamb was Jesus Christ and he died for you and me and now sometimes I think think what can I give God God's given me life he died for me so that I could go free so that I could receive his life and me that I he paid the price for me he took my place just like that just like this sheep took the place of Isaac this lamb took my place now what can I give to him baramas had two doves he had a lamb but what do I have that God wants I mean should I should I give him my car God doesn't need a car should I what should I give him when I think about it the best thing that I can give God is myself I've got this life that he's given me he's allowed me to live on this Earth he he's given me this body that I live in this mind that I have these eyes this mouth these hands he's given me this life life I don't know anything better to give God than to give him myself so that I can be the lamb that I give back to God and the Bible says this in Romans 12 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable to God which is your reasonal service which means you give yourself to God you you give the very best that you can we can give God a little bit of money but why don't we just give him everything we can give a few coins we can give him a little bit of time we can say okay I'll give him every Sunday I'll go to Sunday school and I'll go to church and then I'll give him Wednesday too I'll come to church on Wednesday and so I'm going to give God some of my time or I'll give God some of my money but God doesn't need money and God lives in eternity he doesn't need time do you know what I think God would want more than anything from you I think God wants you I think God wants you to give you yourself to him give your heart to him give your life to him give all of yourself to him to live for him to love him to let him have his way with you to love his word and to obey his word and to surrender all to him and say God I don't know what else to give you I don't know what gift you would like I don't know how much money is enough I don't I how much time is enough but I know one thing you've given me this life I want to give myself to you man I'd like to pray together but I would like everybody to Bow your heads with me if you could close your eyes close your eyes everybody close your eyes bow your head everybody close your eyes bow your head I don't know about you but I'm thankful that God gave a lamb for me I'm thankful that because of Jes Jesus Christ dying for me if I can believe that he died in my place that I can have eternal life I'm so thankful that all my mistakes all my wrongs Jesus paid for it all and I want to give something to him and I've already given Jesus myself I've already given my life to him my heart everything that I am I want him to have it I want him to have all of me CU he paid for me but I'm wondering about each one of you as boys and girls how many of you want to give something to Jesus how many of you would like to give him the best thing that you could give him keep your eyes closed and your heads bowed and I'm just going to ask you if you want to give yourself as a gift to Jesus just raise your hand just raise your hand Jesus will see your hand and you're just going to show Jesus Lord I don't know what else to bring you I don't know what better gift to give but I want to give myself to you I want you to have me and use me any way you want live through me I want you to have my best of my time and my thinking and all my energy I want to give myself to you and so you can put your hands down now Jesus sees your hands and I'm just going to pray with you but when I pray I want you to pray in your heart that you're going to give yourself to Jesus for the rest of your life that you're he's going to be Lord of your life and king of your life and you're going to serve him with your whole life so I'm going to pray over you but you pray in your own heart dear heavenly father I thank you Lord for these children I thank you for the tenderness of their heart I thank you
