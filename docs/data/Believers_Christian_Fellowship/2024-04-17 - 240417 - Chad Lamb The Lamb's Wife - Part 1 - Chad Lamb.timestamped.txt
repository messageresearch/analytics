[6:30] well we've come to you Lord to worship
[6:32] you and to sing your praises and Lord we
[6:35] count it a privilege to be able to do
[6:37] so God there was a day that you were
[6:40] entering in to Jerusalem and they were
[6:42] singing hosana to your name and Lord
[6:46] they wanted them to be quiet the
[6:47] Pharisees tried to stop them but he said
[6:49] if they be quiet the Rocks shall ring
[6:51] out God we can't do anything but sing
[6:54] your Praises for somebody must declare
[6:56] your glory in this world and in this
[6:58] earth Lord You' revealed yourself to us
[7:01] what can we do but declare your glory
[7:03] magnify your name and it's our privilege
[7:06] Lord and now we come Lord to Feast on
[7:09] your word we just ask God you would open
[7:11] another portion of yourself to us
[7:13] instruct Us in the way of righteousness
[7:15] from your word Lord take this vessel
[7:18] under your control that I might be
[7:19] yielded to you and that you might have
[7:21] control and speak your word and your
[7:23] word only and may Lord we Feast on that
[7:26] and grow Stronger by that portion we ask
[7:29] it in Jesus Christ's name
[7:33] amen amen God bless you all while we're
[7:36] standing this evening let's take our
[7:37] Bibles and turn to the Book of
[7:40] Revelation and uh just want to say I
[7:43] heard from Brother Emanuel that he got
[7:45] back from Pittsburgh for ministering for
[7:47] Brother John last Sunday and the
[7:49] services went well he was on his way
[7:51] here this evening but he got caught in a
[7:53] hailstorm and had to turn back so I we
[7:55] just trust that all is well with him and
[7:58] we can see him on Sunday also uh Brother
[8:01] Kyle wer he'll be traveling this Sunday
[8:04] to uh go Minister for brother Jean as
[8:06] well so we want to pray for he and his
[8:08] family and then I want to remind you
[8:10] that this Sunday brother Burley Williams
[8:11] will be preaching for us so we want to
[8:13] keep all of these things in prayer for
[8:15] Brother Kyle and his family for
[8:16] traveling Mercies in Ministry there and
[8:18] brother Burley for the same coming here
[8:21] we're very much looking forward to
[8:22] having him with us
[8:24] again as we're standing with our Bibles
[8:27] let's look at Revelation 19 verse
[8:34] 7 Revelation
[8:36] 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[8:39] honor to him for the marriage of the
[8:41] Lamb is come and his wife ha made
[8:44] herself ready now let's turn to chapter
[8:49] 21 chapter
[8:51] 21:9 let's read there next and there
[8:55] came unto me one of the Seven Angels
[8:57] which had the seven vials full of the
[8:58] seven last place plagues and talked with
[9:00] me saying come hither I will show Thee
[9:02] the bride the Lamb's wife man God bless
[9:06] you as you have your seats may the Lord
[9:08] bless us as we look into his word this
[9:10] evening
[9:11] amen amen without his Blessing it would
[9:15] be impossible without him giving us eyes
[9:17] to see and ears to hear we would be just
[9:19] as lost but I thank God he's promised
[9:21] amen that he would help us in this hour
[9:24] amen we look at these two scriptures and
[9:26] I I grabbed these just to show that
[9:28] without question the lamb has a wife
[9:31] amen the lamb has a wife there's no
[9:34] question about it we read in in chapter
[9:36] 19 that she's made herself ready and in
[9:39] chapter 21 the seventh angel was going
[9:41] to show us the Lamb's wife the bride the
[9:44] Lamb's wife so the lamb has a wife amen
[9:47] I think that's really important so
[9:48] that's what we want to talk about this
[9:49] evening is the Lamb's
[9:51] wife amen how many wants to be that amen
[9:54] that's our desire to be the Lamb's wife
[9:56] We Believe by revelation we are but it
[9:59] it means a lot to say something like
[10:01] that and I wanted to read a quote from
[10:03] proving his word just to show where we
[10:05] are in time we know it really well but
[10:07] I'm going to lay it down uh once again
[10:10] he said Jesus says As it was in the days
[10:12] of Sodom and Sodom now watch close in
[10:14] the days of Sodom so will it be at the
[10:17] coming of the son of man when the son of
[10:19] man is being revealed not no more is a
[10:21] church SE not no more the bride is
[10:23] called see in that day the son of man
[10:25] will be revealed what to join the church
[10:28] to the Head unite the marriage of the
[10:30] Bride so the re the revealing of the son
[10:33] of man is the coming of the son of man
[10:35] to do what to unite The Head and the
[10:38] body to unite the bride and with the
[10:41] head for the marriage of the Bride the
[10:44] bridegroom call will come right through
[10:46] this when the son of man will come down
[10:48] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[10:51] together the church has to be the word
[10:53] he is the word and the two unites
[10:56] together and to do that it'll take the
[10:58] manifestation of the revealing of the
[11:00] son of man not a clergyman oh I don't
[11:03] know do you see what I mean brother R
[11:05] says it's not a clergyman so you don't
[11:06] look at him it's not a preacher he said
[11:08] it's more than the preacher it's more
[11:10] than the clergy man it's more than the
[11:12] man it's the son of man coming
[11:14] down he's working through that flesh of
[11:17] course but it's the son of man he says
[11:19] not a clergyman oh I don't know do you
[11:21] see what I mean it's son of man Jesus
[11:25] Christ will come down in human flesh
[11:27] Among Us and will make his word so real
[11:30] that it'll unite the church in him as
[11:31] one the bride and then she'll go home to
[11:34] the wedding supper amen she's already
[11:36] United see we go to the wedding supper
[11:39] not to the marriage now this is the
[11:41] purpose for me reading this so we can
[11:43] get this point here amen he so he goes
[11:45] to quote of scripture fill yourself of
[11:47] the Flesh of Mighty Men cuz the marriage
[11:49] of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is
[11:52] going to the wedding supper when the
[11:54] word here unites with the person and
[11:56] they two become one then what does it do
[11:58] then it manifests the son of man again
[12:01] not the church theologians the son of
[12:02] man the word and the church becomes one
[12:05] whatever the son of man done he was the
[12:07] word the church does the same thing amen
[12:10] this quote is so Monumental because it
[12:12] tells us where we are in time amen and
[12:15] we are now in the marriage of the Lamb
[12:17] the marriage of the Lamb has come the
[12:19] marriage is taking place right now so
[12:21] the son of man has come down into flesh
[12:24] not a clergymen but he's he's using that
[12:26] flesh to manifest himself it's the
[12:28] revealing of the son of man to make his
[12:30] word so real that it'll unite The Head
[12:33] and the body it'll bring the marriage of
[12:35] the bride and the bridegroom call will
[12:37] come through this and he said the
[12:38] marriage is taking place now the
[12:40] invisible Union is taking place now the
[12:43] Rapture will be going to the marriage
[12:45] supper amen so that's why when we talk
[12:49] about the Lamb's wife amen it's
[12:51] important to know that the marriage is
[12:52] taking place now amen amen we're not
[12:56] talking about something future we talk
[12:58] about the Lamb's wife amen but he's
[13:00] taking his bride to himself now this is
[13:02] the dispensation we live in where he's
[13:04] uniting with her and he's uniting one by
[13:07] one as as as the members of his body
[13:09] gathered together they're uniting with
[13:11] the headship of Christ and the marriage
[13:13] of the Lamb is taking place
[13:17] amen so that
[13:20] means that means the lamb has a
[13:25] wife but wife brings with it a the term
[13:30] wife brings with it a whole set of
[13:33] responsibilities that are different than
[13:35] just
[13:36] bride and that's what we want to talk
[13:38] about for a little while and we might
[13:40] continue on I don't know how much we'll
[13:41] get done but but it just keeps unfolding
[13:44] as we go so the term wife when we come
[13:46] to the term wife amen we have you have
[13:49] bride and you can be talking about a a
[13:53] an engagement phase and and a phase
[13:55] leading up to marriage amen but but when
[13:58] you talk about wife it brings a whole
[14:00] new set of responsibilities and a whole
[14:02] new Set uh of of of of of
[14:05] responsibilities and issues amen that we
[14:07] must administer and so uh my my wife was
[14:12] my bride before she was my
[14:14] wife but now that she's my wife she's
[14:16] still my
[14:18] bride I'm still a
[14:20] bride but I believe by the union of
[14:23] Christ I've become the Lamb's wife part
[14:25] of that wife I'm not it in a whole but
[14:27] we are many member many member body and
[14:30] so because I believe that to be true
[14:32] amen the then the question is am I
[14:34] willing to take the responsibility of
[14:36] wife that's different than just bride
[14:39] not girlfriend phase not engagement
[14:41] phase amen but now the wife what
[14:43] responsibility is that let's go back to
[14:47] Genesis chapter 2 and keep laying a few
[14:50] scriptures in
[14:52] here Genesis chapter 2
[15:01] in verse
[15:04] 23 and Adam said this is now bone of my
[15:07] bones and flesh and my flesh she shall
[15:08] be called woman because she was taken
[15:10] out of man therefore shall a man leave
[15:13] his father and his mother and shall
[15:14] cleave unto his wife and they shall be
[15:17] one flesh now let's go to Ephesians
[15:19] chapter
[15:24] 5 all the way to the New Testament to
[15:28] the Apostle Paul writing to the Ephesian
[15:31] Church Ephesians chapter
[15:34] 5 and I'm going to read verse 29 to 32
[15:39] Ephesians 5 for no man ever yet hated
[15:42] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[15:43] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[15:45] church for we are members of his body of
[15:48] his flesh and of his bones now he goes
[15:51] right back to what what Adam just said
[15:54] for this cause shall a man leave his
[15:56] father and mother and shall be joined
[15:57] unto his wife and they shall be one
[15:59] flesh this is a great mystery but I
[16:01] speak concerning Christ and the church
[16:04] so he says in verse 30 we are members of
[16:07] his body of his flesh and of his bones I
[16:10] don't know how more specific he can be
[16:12] that we are part of his body amen and so
[16:16] this is what Adam said would take place
[16:18] in a marriage and this is what uh the
[16:20] Apostle Paul is saying is taking place
[16:22] in the marriage that we become part of
[16:24] his flesh of of his flesh of his see
[16:28] here I want to get it right members of
[16:30] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[16:33] amen we are united with him now we've
[16:36] come to the to the marriage of the lamb
[16:39] praise
[16:41] God
[16:42] and he speaks a great mystery it looks
[16:46] like marriage uh Earthly marriage but
[16:48] it's only typing the union between
[16:50] Christ and the bride and they are to be
[16:52] one flesh brother brandham says not I'm
[16:56] sorry not brother brandham but the angel
[16:58] of the Lord told him to pick up his pen
[16:59] and write and I'm going to read this
[17:00] from the church age book and just read
[17:02] just a small segment said notice the
[17:04] harmony of the father and the son Jesus
[17:06] never did anything until it was first
[17:08] showed him by the father this harmony is
[17:11] now to exist between the groom and his
[17:12] bride he shows her his Word of Life she
[17:15] receives it she never doubts it
[17:17] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[17:19] death for the seed be planted the water
[17:21] will raise it up again here is the
[17:23] secret of this the word is in the bride
[17:25] as it was in Mary the bride has the mind
[17:28] of Christ for she knows what he wants
[17:30] done with the word she performs the
[17:31] command of the word in his name for she
[17:33] has thus sayith the Lord then the word
[17:35] is quickened by the spirit and it comes
[17:37] to pass like a seed that is planted and
[17:39] watered it comes the full Harvest
[17:41] serving its purpose those in the bride
[17:43] do only his will no one can make them do
[17:46] otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord
[17:48] or they keep still they know that it has
[17:50] to be God in them doing the works
[17:52] fulfilling his own word he did not
[17:55] complete all his work while in his
[17:56] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[17:59] through the
[18:00] bride she knows that for it was not yet
[18:02] time for him to do certain things that
[18:04] he must now do but he will now fulfill
[18:07] through the bride that work which he
[18:09] left for this specific time I find this
[18:12] quote
[18:13] fascinating amen because it wasn't
[18:15] brother brandham just receiving a
[18:17] revelation or even seeing a vision it
[18:19] was actually the angel of the Lord told
[18:20] him to pick up his pen and write and he
[18:22] was writing and not even knowing what he
[18:24] was writing till he stopped and and and
[18:26] and he took it out and he had to read
[18:28] what he just wrote showing that this is
[18:30] a message from the angel of the Lord to
[18:32] us declaring to us that there was
[18:35] something that Christ did not finish in
[18:37] his Earthly Journey he left he left what
[18:39] did he leave it for for the other part
[18:40] of himself for the other part of his
[18:42] body those who are members of his body
[18:44] of his flesh and of his bones he left
[18:46] that part of the work for them to do
[18:49] amen and now in order to do that work
[18:52] she must come under the headship of
[18:55] Christ which is the fullness of this
[18:56] word that's been restored and she must
[18:58] have thus sayeth the Lord amen which is
[19:01] the word and she must have that or she
[19:03] keeps still what's it showing she must
[19:05] come to the place of of a submissive
[19:07] wife of a perfectly submissive wife in
[19:10] order to fulfill this commission she
[19:13] can't fulfill it on her own she can't
[19:15] fulfill it without his headship she
[19:16] can't fulfill it without being
[19:18] submissive to her
[19:20] headship amen but yet it must be
[19:23] fulfilled cuz it was left for this
[19:26] specific time it's not going to be left
[19:28] undone he's not going to not finish any
[19:31] of his work but he's going to finish it
[19:32] but he must have a a bride he must have
[19:35] a wife who comes under the submission of
[19:37] headship in order to finish this work
[19:40] that's why it's different to be a a wife
[19:42] than just a bride amen because the wife
[19:45] now comes under the headship of her of
[19:48] her husband and she must come under
[19:50] complete authority of her husband amen
[19:53] sometimes we wonder why we preach
[19:55] headship and why we preach submission
[19:57] and the roles of and the roles of a
[19:59] woman and the roles of a husband and the
[20:00] roles of a wife amen because our Earthly
[20:03] marriages must be a reflection of this
[20:05] image of Christ in his bride amen and
[20:08] it's not just preaching it to so so we
[20:10] can have men who are egotistical and and
[20:13] they get to dominate over the women it
[20:14] has nothing to do with any of that it
[20:16] has everything to do with keeping the
[20:18] picture of the Bible pure and straight
[20:21] and that's why brother B said one of the
[20:23] most horrible things on earth is a
[20:25] dominating woman
[20:28] why because it's the spirit that's in
[20:30] the Catholic church it's the spirit of
[20:33] denominationalism a dominating woman
[20:35] amen it it ruins the entire picture
[20:37] because the only way that God can finish
[20:40] his work amen through Christ is for her
[20:42] to take on the headship of Christ and
[20:44] come into submission to that word
[20:46] regardless of her thoughts or feelings
[20:48] or
[20:50] ideas why because her husband Christ
[20:53] Jesus Christ when he was here he had to
[20:55] come under complete submission to the
[20:57] headship of the father father and only
[20:59] then could he finish his commission his
[21:01] part of the commission now the further
[21:04] part of the commission the work that he
[21:05] left for this specific time can only be
[21:08] done if we come under perfect headship
[21:10] Amen to our
[21:12] bridegroom
[21:14] amen so it's different than girlfriend
[21:18] boyfriend it's different than the the
[21:21] the stage of the butterflies and the
[21:23] excitement and enthusiasm amen now it
[21:26] comes to the place where where we get
[21:28] down to the reality of Life yes
[21:33] amen I I as I told you I said I believe
[21:36] it was when I was in Australia I said it
[21:38] like this uh everybody wants to be a
[21:41] bride but nobody wants to be the wife
[21:43] because when the honeymoon's over after
[21:46] the after the big day and the pageantry
[21:48] and the flowers and the decorations and
[21:50] the Beautiful music and the and the and
[21:52] the woman being the center of attention
[21:54] the beautiful dress and all of that amen
[21:57] after the honeymoon's over you come back
[21:59] and and somebody's got to do the dishes
[22:01] somebody's got to pack the lunch
[22:03] somebody's got to wash the clothes amen
[22:05] it's not all fuzzy feelings all the time
[22:09] it's not all glory and it's not all
[22:11] pageantry all the time sometimes you get
[22:14] down to the work of being a
[22:16] wife amen and it's about service
[22:21] submission it's about
[22:25] sacrifice brother BR said in the token
[22:27] he says Jesus was baptized by John and
[22:31] the Bible said and they saw the spirit
[22:32] of God like a dove coming down upon him
[22:35] therefore if it would have been a wolf
[22:38] or if it had been any other animal the
[22:39] nature of the dove could not have
[22:41] blended with the nature of the wolf
[22:43] neither could the nature of the dove
[22:44] blend with any other animal but the lamb
[22:47] and those two Natures come together then
[22:50] they could agree with each
[22:52] other what if the dove had come down and
[22:55] instead of it being a lamb there would
[22:56] have been some other animal it would
[22:58] quickly have taken its flight and went
[23:00] back but when he found that nature that
[23:02] he could blend into he just became one
[23:06] and then the dove led the lamb and
[23:08] notice it led the lamb to slaughter now
[23:12] the lamb was obedient to the dove no
[23:14] matter where it led it was willing to
[23:16] go and so now brother bram's showing a
[23:19] picture of that day on the on the banks
[23:22] of Jordan when Jesus was baptized and
[23:24] the spirit of God descended like a dove
[23:26] and it rested upon the lamb and he
[23:27] mentions a several different places he
[23:29] said that Dove could not rest on
[23:32] anything with a nature an aggressive
[23:33] nature or the wrong nature a wolf or
[23:35] anything else it could only rest on a
[23:37] lamb because they had the same
[23:40] nature and when it rested on the lamb
[23:42] then the dove became the leader of the
[23:45] lamb and the lamb followed the
[23:46] leadership of the dove amen because
[23:49] because the lamb is a follower a lamb is
[23:52] submissive amen so now the dove couldn't
[23:55] descend anywhere else but it said notice
[23:57] and the and and it led the lamb to
[24:01] slaughter but the lamb followed along
[24:04] another question is if the lamb has a
[24:06] wife what kind of wife will the lamb
[24:09] have if the lamb has a wife then his
[24:12] wife will be a
[24:14] lamb because there's no h breeding there
[24:18] couldn't be anything else there couldn't
[24:19] be any other nature there couldn't be
[24:21] any other kind of animal if the lamb has
[24:23] a wife then his wife must be a
[24:26] lamb oh praise God and we know that the
[24:29] that the dove the Holy Ghost could not
[24:31] descend on any other nature only on the
[24:33] nature of the lamb but we live in the
[24:35] day amen when when when the Holy Ghost
[24:38] has descended in full measure at the
[24:39] opening of the word to rest where on
[24:42] Lambs amen coming back on the lamb to do
[24:46] what to lead the
[24:47] lamb in Matthew 4:1 it says then was
[24:50] Jesus led up of the spirit unto the
[24:53] Wilderness to be tempted of the
[24:56] devil when Jesus received this Holy
[24:58] Ghost when the Dove came and began to
[25:00] lead him where is the first place the
[25:03] dove leads him the dove leads him into
[25:05] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[25:06] devil what a leading place to lead the
[25:09] lamb but the lamb is a sacrificial
[25:12] animal and he's a submissive
[25:14] animal so if we want to be the bride
[25:17] what kind of nature should we exhibit as
[25:19] the bride the same that Christ
[25:21] had
[25:24] amen so where can the spirit lead us to
[25:29] where the question is where will we
[25:31] where will we be willing to follow the
[25:33] dove
[25:36] to We Will Follow the dove to
[25:40] Blessings we may follow the dove to
[25:42] church we may follow the dove to special
[25:44] meetings we may follow the dove in
[25:46] blessing and reward are we willing to
[25:48] follow the dove into the Wilderness to
[25:50] be tempted of the
[25:51] devil what if that's where that's what
[25:54] if that's where the dove wants to lead
[25:56] are we going to change nature and stop
[25:58] being a lamb if the dove wants to lead
[26:01] us into the Wilderness to be tempted of
[26:03] the devil are we going to be the Lamb's
[26:06] wife and have the same nature of the
[26:08] Lamb because there's no high
[26:11] breeding so if he's a lamb we have to be
[26:13] a lamb and if the and the dove leads the
[26:15] lamb then can the Holy Ghost lead us
[26:18] today into places we don't even in our
[26:20] flesh want to go amen Jesus in his flesh
[26:24] I'm sure he didn't want to go fasting 40
[26:26] days and afterwards being aung and when
[26:28] he was Hunger now being tempted of the
[26:30] devil with all of these Temptations but
[26:32] he had to pass the
[26:34] test amen so now are we willing to be a
[26:41] wife to go to go anywhere our bridegroom
[26:46] goes are we willing to be a wife I mean
[26:49] before before we're a wife before we say
[26:52] yes we can we can weigh things out you
[26:54] know I'm talking in the natural we can
[26:56] look at it we can look at a young man if
[26:58] there's a young man interested in a
[26:59] young woman she can sit back and she can
[27:01] say I mean what what kind of nature is
[27:03] he does he have a good job what kind of
[27:05] home will he provide amen where does he
[27:07] live and what's he doing and and all of
[27:09] those things she can consider but the
[27:11] day she says yes and she takes those
[27:13] vows amen she is now under the headship
[27:16] of the man amen and her days of choosing
[27:19] are now over because she's accepted the
[27:21] headship of this man if he moves she
[27:25] moves amen if he loses all her his
[27:28] wealth with a poor decision she's lost
[27:30] all her wealth she must stick with
[27:33] him amen is that true or not true then
[27:38] if that's true in the natural what's
[27:40] true in the spiritual amen if the if
[27:42] this is the way the Lamb's going to walk
[27:44] which way is the Lamb's wife going to
[27:46] walk if he passes through Troubled Water
[27:49] what is she going to do say I'm not
[27:51] going there I'm going back to Mom and
[27:52] Dad she's not going back to Mom and Dad
[27:54] she's married to the lamb
[27:58] amen
[28:00] amen why sometimes we want the benefits
[28:02] amen but we don't want the sacrifice we
[28:05] want the we want the label and we want
[28:06] the day of Glory but we don't want the
[28:08] day of sacrifice and surrender and
[28:13] submission but if he was a lamb she'll
[28:15] be a
[28:16] lamb amen it'll be the nature and our
[28:19] nature is being changed to the nature of
[28:21] the
[28:22] Lamb amen let's go to Romans chapter 8
[28:35] Romans chapter
[28:41] 8 I'm going look at verse
[28:45] 29 Romans 8 verse
[28:48] 29 for whom he did for know he also did
[28:52] predestinate to be conformed to the
[28:54] image of his son that he might be the
[28:57] firstborn among many
[28:59] Brethren I thank God that he
[29:01] predestinated to be conformed to the
[29:03] image of his son it's our only hope but
[29:06] yet we know what the destination is to
[29:08] be conformed into the image of the sun
[29:11] to be like the
[29:12] lamb amen we know that we've been
[29:15] reading in second Peter 1 we've read it
[29:17] several times now the last several times
[29:19] we ministered how that he's given us
[29:22] precious promises that by these we might
[29:24] be partakers of the divine nature amen
[29:26] adding to our faith virtue and all of
[29:28] these things all the way up to the
[29:30] Capstone which is love so what are the
[29:32] Divine Promises by these were to be to
[29:34] partakers of the divine nature to what
[29:36] to come into His very nature the nature
[29:38] of what the nature of the
[29:40] Lamb amen and so that's what we're
[29:43] called to in this
[29:45] day and let's go to Ephesians 4 and
[29:48] we're going to look at the same thing in
[29:50] Ephesians chapter 4
[30:00] because it's the work of the ministry
[30:01] now Ephesians
[30:04] 4:11 and he gave some Apostles and some
[30:06] prophets and some evangelists and some
[30:08] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[30:11] of the Saints for the work of the
[30:12] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[30:14] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[30:16] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[30:18] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[30:21] measure of the stature of the fullness
[30:24] of Christ amen the destination is clear
[30:28] what Journey are we on we're coming into
[30:30] His
[30:31] Image we're coming into the image of
[30:34] Christ we're coming into the image of
[30:35] the Lamb that's what the ministry is
[30:38] supposed to be producing for the
[30:39] edifying of the Body for the perfecting
[30:42] amen so they all come into a perfect man
[30:44] and until we come into the the measure
[30:46] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[30:49] what are we coming here Sunday and
[30:50] Wednesday and Sunday and Wednesday and
[30:52] Sunday and Wednesday why keep why are we
[30:54] doing this because the word is molding
[30:56] us into the very image and nature of the
[30:58] Lamb because we're the Lamb's wife and
[31:00] we must reflect the lamb and so we have
[31:03] to keep getting molded and molded Into
[31:05] His Image why because the destination is
[31:08] clear we're moving to the Capstone which
[31:10] is love which is God right God is love
[31:13] and he's got to bring us into his nature
[31:15] we must reflect on this Earth the nature
[31:17] of the
[31:18] Lamb because why we're the Lamb's
[31:22] wife and so we we can we can want to do
[31:27] so so many things and we can want to be
[31:29] so many things and we can think of a a a
[31:32] a great powerful move in the end time
[31:35] but the most powerful move that I can
[31:36] think of is God taking the people under
[31:39] absolute under control and having
[31:41] preeminence and doing only what he
[31:44] says amen not going off on our own ideas
[31:48] and not trying to conjure up our own and
[31:50] solve our own problems amen because
[31:52] that's not what the wife is to do she's
[31:54] to come submissive to her husband not to
[31:56] solve her own problem not to not not to
[31:58] take her own ideas but she's there as a
[32:01] help me to her husband Amen to take his
[32:03] vision and his plan and help manifest it
[32:06] and the
[32:07] home amen that's why I think it's it's
[32:10] so important amen that we understand
[32:13] what nature that we're under that if
[32:15] we're the Lamb's wife we're also a
[32:17] lamb
[32:19] amen uh do you remember the
[32:22] story that brother brandom
[32:24] told of those two young couples that he
[32:27] married we've talked to it many many
[32:29] times but the one was the rich couple
[32:31] one was the poor couple and he took the
[32:33] poor couple and he and they come to his
[32:35] uh front room and he married them in his
[32:37] front room and he was poor and she was
[32:39] poor and they didn't have a enough money
[32:40] to hire a preacher and and his brother
[32:43] doc told him my brother will do that and
[32:45] right and they come right into his
[32:46] living room and and they were shabby and
[32:49] she hardly had any shoes on at all or
[32:50] hardly had a dress no shoes on and and
[32:53] he married that couple and he's
[32:56] comparing and contrasting it with the
[32:57] rich couple but the part that always
[32:59] stands out to me is when he comes down
[33:02] to the to the point when he wants to
[33:04] check up on them and he goes along as as
[33:07] he acting like he says acting like he's
[33:10] checking the the electric poles and the
[33:13] insulators in the poles and and he gets
[33:15] up close and we know about the rich
[33:17] people they were fussing and they were
[33:18] fighting and they had everything but he
[33:20] comes up to this little home here that
[33:22] had nothing was in shambles and he and
[33:24] he starts to listen and he hears a
[33:26] conversation and he Peaks through the
[33:27] cracking the door and he sees her
[33:29] sitting on his lap and they've got an
[33:31] old hat turned upside down they got a
[33:33] little bit of money in there and they're
[33:35] counting so much money for groceries and
[33:37] so much for insurance and so much for
[33:39] that and brother bam said they didn't
[33:41] have enough to meet the ends and then he
[33:43] said oh I I want to buy you that dress
[33:48] so
[33:49] bad and she said oh I don't need a dress
[33:53] the one I got is
[33:55] fine and he says but you look so PR
[33:57] pretty in it and she goes oh I don't
[33:59] need it and brother M said when he
[34:01] looked through that CL crack she was
[34:03] sitting on his lap he had his arm around
[34:05] her she had her arm around him and they
[34:07] really loved one another and brother
[34:10] said he looked from there he could see
[34:11] the steeple on the house up on the hill
[34:13] and he said William Brandon which one
[34:14] would you want he said I take that
[34:17] character down here but what was it she
[34:20] took the same nature as her husband what
[34:24] happened on the hill amen that woman
[34:26] took the same nature as as her husband
[34:28] yes he was jealous he was spoiled he was
[34:32] selfish and what was she she was jealous
[34:34] and she was spoiled and she was selfish
[34:36] he chose one that reflected his
[34:38] character and then she was molded into
[34:41] his image and she was reflecting back to
[34:43] him what he
[34:46] was amen but this one down on the hill
[34:49] that's why I think it's so detrimental
[34:51] amen if you ever start criticizing your
[34:53] husband or start criticizing your wife
[34:55] amen you're on Dangerous Ground because
[34:57] you are to be
[34:59] one and you start tearing him down amen
[35:02] that's who you're supposed to reflect
[35:04] and you start tearing her down and she's
[35:06] your
[35:08] reflection oh my goodness what we need
[35:10] to do is get on our knees and say God
[35:12] help me get this right understanding
[35:14] amen cuz something's not
[35:16] working amen so now this little one down
[35:20] this this little couple down here she
[35:22] was a reflection of him he was
[35:24] sacrificing for her and she was SA
[35:27] sacrificing for him he didn't he didn't
[35:30] want a new fishing pole he didn't want
[35:31] new fishing lures he didn't want to take
[35:33] a vacation what he wanted to do with the
[35:35] little bit of money he had left over is
[35:37] he wanted to buy her a
[35:38] dress what was he doing he was
[35:41] sacrificing for her you know what she
[35:43] had the same nature of him she wasn't
[35:45] saying well just let the insurance go
[35:47] amen I'll take the
[35:49] dress that would have been the wrong
[35:51] nature that would have been the nature
[35:53] for the woman on the hill in the ivory
[35:55] Palace but she was reflecting her
[35:57] husband when he sacrificed for her she
[36:00] sacrificed for
[36:03] him and what did Christ do for you and I
[36:06] amen what should we do for
[36:08] him amen what right do I have to be
[36:11] selfish and take and never give back
[36:14] amen and want the showering of praises
[36:16] and all the things that come upon me but
[36:18] I don't want to give myself to the
[36:20] ministry and I don't want to give myself
[36:21] to Christ and I don't want to give
[36:23] myself for the furthering of the
[36:26] Kingdom help us Lord
[36:31] Jesus you
[36:35] know brother Brenham asked this couple
[36:38] before they got married he says what'll
[36:43] happen if you run out of work and you
[36:45] run out of money are you going to send
[36:48] her back to mom and dad he says no we'll
[36:51] struggle right
[36:52] along and he asked this young woman he
[36:55] says what'll happen if he loses his job
[36:57] and he can't take care of you anymore
[36:59] are you going to run back to Mom and
[37:01] Dad and she says no I'll stick with
[37:05] him and brother brandham said it made me
[37:07] feel little when I saw that they really
[37:09] loved each
[37:13] other so sad friends when Christ doesn't
[37:17] give us everything we
[37:20] want and we're willing to walk
[37:24] away when Christ doesn't answer every
[37:27] prayer
[37:29] request and we get angry and get
[37:33] upset when Christ doesn't give us
[37:35] everything we want and we start to pout
[37:38] yes and the question is which kind of
[37:41] wife am I reflecting the one on the hill
[37:44] or the one in the Box
[37:48] Car
[37:50] amen we've got to realize that I'm
[37:53] married to the
[37:54] lamb I'm not my own I'm not here for
[37:57] myself I'm not here to find my own way
[38:01] listen you know you know how horrible it
[38:04] is what a terrible picture it is when a
[38:06] man will come home and he's worked all
[38:09] that he can work and he's done all that
[38:10] he can do and and and his wife just
[38:12] wants more I want more furniture I want
[38:14] more Goods I want more this and I want
[38:16] more that and he says honey I've done
[38:18] all I can I can't do no more and she
[38:20] says well I'll just leave the house go
[38:22] get a job and I'll buy it for myself
[38:24] [Music]
[38:28] we've just marred the image of Christ in
[38:30] his bride why because you're taking it
[38:32] into your this is what the church has
[38:34] done they taken it into their hands to
[38:36] provide for themselves well we'll just
[38:38] have a program and we'll just have a
[38:39] school and we'll just do all of these
[38:41] things ourselves amen why they're not
[38:44] waiting on God to do it and if God
[38:46] doesn't do it saying hey that's fine
[38:48] with me if now's not the time if we
[38:50] don't have the money amen if if you
[38:52] decide Lord that it's not a good time
[38:54] for us to have this then we say you know
[38:56] best
[38:59] amen so we talk about you know you know
[39:02] brother brandham even preached on women
[39:04] working but he also he was balanced in
[39:06] all things he wasn't legalistic in it he
[39:09] he even commended amen a few women in
[39:11] his church who were working and they
[39:13] kept their honor and integrity even at
[39:14] the manufacturing PL and from the pull
[39:17] pit he gave them honor and respect for
[39:19] that but he said they were helping their
[39:22] husband build a
[39:24] house right so it's not about just it
[39:27] that's not it it's not about just
[39:29] working or not working what it's about
[39:31] is keeping the image right amen not
[39:34] making our own money so that we can make
[39:35] our own decisions I make my money I make
[39:37] my own decisions with the money I make
[39:39] that completely ruins the image of
[39:42] Christ in his bride that is the wrong
[39:44] kind of
[39:45] reflection so brother bandham when he
[39:48] was talking about these things he was
[39:49] talking about the image of Christ he was
[39:51] talking about why when he explained
[39:53] these things amen because the home must
[39:55] be a reflection of Christ and his every
[39:58] marriage must be a reflection of Christ
[39:59] and his
[40:01] bride amen but when we want to go
[40:04] provide for ourselves and we want to if
[40:06] we're told no and then no's not good
[40:11] enough I mean it it's it's
[40:15] detrimental and what it shows is
[40:18] everybody wants to be a bride nobody
[40:20] wants to be the wife
[40:28] remember I think I was thinking about
[40:30] this when brother Simon Abbott was here
[40:32] last last and brother Simon said
[40:34] everyone wants to be the queen but no
[40:36] one wants to bake the cake I was sitting
[40:38] in an airplane when I heard that and I
[40:40] was laughing out
[40:42] loud everyone be wants to be the queen
[40:44] but nobody wants nobody wants to do the
[40:46] hard
[40:48] work but Christ was willing to sacrifice
[40:50] for
[40:52] us amen we pull bad attitudes and yes
[40:57] people will leave church because they
[40:59] didn't get their way people will leave
[41:02] the message because they didn't get to
[41:04] do what they wanted because the message
[41:05] was a hindrance to what they
[41:10] wanted how is that the nature of the
[41:14] Lamb amen what about
[41:17] sacrificing when a woman comes to a
[41:19] marriage amen now she gives her body to
[41:21] this man why because he's going to make
[41:23] his family he's going to make his home
[41:25] and when she receives his child amen all
[41:28] of a sudden she's given herself
[41:29] completely over to this man he's going
[41:31] to reproduce himself and produce his
[41:32] family and she gives her body completely
[41:35] to it she gives up her Comfort she gives
[41:36] up her sleep her diet changes her body
[41:39] changes everything changes cuz she
[41:41] submitted to her husband and now to
[41:43] she's supporting the family the bringing
[41:45] forth of the family amen and she gives
[41:47] her she has to give her all to
[41:50] it what should we be doing amen for
[41:53] Christ to reproduce himself amen Christ
[41:55] has a bride and he wants to minister
[41:58] Amen to his children through his bride
[42:00] amen and we can't be selfish but we must
[42:02] give
[42:03] ourselves even giving ourselves to one
[42:06] another amen for the nurturing up of
[42:09] God's children amen what about
[42:11] sacrificing for each

[42:30] life you won't come up anyhow no matter
[42:33] how religious how good how many churches

[42:37] doesn't matter one thing unless you've
[42:39] been born again why you've got to have
[42:42] that life on
[42:44] display we know the quote really well
[42:46] out of Revelation CH 4 when he says Oh
[42:50] how we need in Jeff and build thousands
[42:52] of lived voices the Thunder of God
[42:55] thundering out sweetness and Holiness
[42:56] purity undefiled lives walking around in
[42:59] the Earth today without a blemish yes
[43:01] sir real Christians that's Thunder
[43:03] against the
[43:05] enemy the devil don't care how loud you
[43:07] holler the devil don't care how much you
[43:08] can jump or how much you can do this or
[43:10] shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see
[43:12] that Sanctified holy life consecrated to
[43:15] God say anything to him call him
[43:16] anything just as sweet as it can be and
[43:18] move right on oh my that throws him away
[43:21] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[43:24] listen to what he just said amen when it
[43:26] hurts the devil is to see that
[43:28] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[43:31] why that was the
[43:32] lamb Sanctified holy consecrated to God
[43:35] that's what hurt the devil that day
[43:37] what's going to hurt the devil today the
[43:39] same kind of life in her yeah what was
[43:42] in him being in her is what's going to
[43:44] shake the
[43:45] devil and then listen what he says say
[43:48] anything to him call him anything just
[43:50] as sweet as can be move right on oh my
[43:53] that throws him away that's the Thunder
[43:55] that shakes the devil
[43:58] you say if I could preach like Billy
[44:00] Graham or Oral Roberts or somebody a
[44:01] great influential speaker oh no
[44:04] sometimes the devil just laughs at that
[44:06] he don't pay no more attention to that
[44:07] than nothing you get all the theology
[44:09] you wanted and all the Seminary training
[44:11] and the devil just sit back and laugh at
[44:12] it but when he sees that life what life
[44:17] the life of the Lamb where in
[44:21] her the same life reflected in her
[44:24] that's what he's trying to get
[44:25] preeminence to do now is he's trying to
[44:27] bring that life into a body he got
[44:30] preeminence in the lamb now is he going
[44:32] to pre pre have preeminence in the
[44:33] Lamb's wife I believe he will because he
[44:36] promised he
[44:38] would amen when I when I looked at this
[44:42] subject when I was thinking about it
[44:44] meditating on it I went back to the
[44:46] marriage vows and I looked back at the
[44:48] marriage vows that we take in in that
[44:51] that we use when we when we marry a man
[44:53] and a woman
[44:54] together and we we say I and whatever

[45:27] ordinance and thereto I give thee my

[46:02] running away because I've pledged myself
[46:04] to
[46:05] him oh praise be to God how should we
[46:08] pledge ourselves to Christ amen only for
[46:11] richer only for better only for the
[46:14] benefits or are we here in the good
[46:16] times and the low
[46:19] times you know Christ didn't come to
[46:21] Earth just for the highlights amen he
[46:23] came down to be spit upon he came down
[46:25] to be rejected he came down to be mocked
[46:27] and why did he do it he did it for me he
[46:29] sacrificed for me and if the lamb
[46:31] sacrificed for me his wife the Lamb's
[46:34] wife ought to reflect his image right
[46:36] back to
[46:38] him oh praise God God help us Amen to
[46:42] come to the realization and the reality
[46:44] of this because I don't want to be a
[46:45] fair weather Christian I want to be the
[46:47] real deal amen if I pass through poverty
[46:50] with my Lord you say how could he he
[46:52] owns the cattle in the Thousand Hills
[46:54] but sometimes he's got to bring us down
[46:56] into the Valley Amen to move somewhere
[46:58] else and it comes down to a a a time of
[47:01] without a time of lacking a time of
[47:04] suffering amen and can I walk with him
[47:06] in a time of suffering the same I can
[47:08] walk with him in a time of blessing can
[47:11] I trust him the same can I stay
[47:12] submissive to his word the same or am I
[47:15] going to start getting discouraged and
[47:16] quit coming to church amen and start
[47:18] doing other things amen because why well
[47:21] I'm just so down because times are so
[47:22] tough and things are going wrong and
[47:24] nothing goes right for me and I got
[47:26] discouraged and I quit coming to church
[47:28] why did you give up on Christ he never
[47:30] gave up on you what about your pledge to
[47:32] be a wife and stop being a girlfriend
[47:35] and be a wife
[47:37] amen when times are tough don't leave
[47:39] your husband when times are good don't
[47:42] leave your husband in sickness and in
[47:44] health but I'm sick and he didn't heal
[47:46] me and I got discouraged and I quit
[47:47] coming why did you give up on him as is
[47:50] his word that tells you to come to the
[47:52] con congregation to the fellowship amen
[47:55] why dishonor him just because of a poor
[47:58] time or a sick
[48:01] time or a worse
[48:07] time does he not know how he's
[48:10] leading can we not trust him in All
[48:14] Things Christ
[48:16] suffered for me can I suffer for him he
[48:20] was rejected for me can I stand
[48:22] rejection for him
[48:27] if you've if you proclaimed this message
[48:29] long enough you've been rejected for
[48:31] it and this message is
[48:34] Christ he was rejected for me can I be
[48:37] rejected for
[48:38] him he was stepped on and he was mocked
[48:41] and he was made fun of and he was called
[48:43] be
[48:45] elub can I be called names for
[48:49] him it's it's coming down to the
[48:54] reality I yes I can't help it it's just
[48:57] the reality
[49:00] friends there's a there's a scripture
[49:02] that I've been meditating on that I want
[49:05] to bring to you but first I want to I
[49:08] want to go to a couple other places and
[49:09] then I'll get to the
[49:11] scripture in the in chrisis the mystery
[49:14] of God revealed brother B said Satan
[49:17] said he's talking about the temptation
[49:19] to Eve oh you know but she turned around
[49:22] and listened to him but the Eve in the
[49:24] last day is not going to do it because
[49:26] she's predestinated not to do
[49:29] it listen the only hope I have the only
[49:33] hope I have in making it and not failing
[49:35] is cuz he predestinated me to make it
[49:37] and not fail not because I have any
[49:39] ability to do it myself but this is the
[49:41] hour we live in when his bride will be
[49:43] on
[49:44] display because she's predestinated not
[49:47] to yes sir God's going to do it he knows
[49:49] he'll have it he said this his church
[49:52] would be here without spot or wrinkle
[49:53] she's going to stand there in the
[49:55] Splendor of him his word manifest she'll
[49:58] be a token to the
[50:01] world she'll be a token to the world
[50:04] something that they can look
[50:06] at and then let's go to Second
[50:08] Corinthians now second Corinthians I
[50:11] still haven't got to the scripture I'm
[50:13] meditating on but we'll get there 2
[50:17] Corinthians chapter
[50:21] 3 verse 2 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse
[50:26] ver
[50:31] two says ye are our epistle written in
[50:34] our hearts known and read of all
[50:37] men for as much as you are manifestly
[50:39] declared to be the Epistle of Christ I
[50:41] love that the Epistle of Christ that
[50:44] means you're the letter Christ wrote To
[50:46] The World the epistle uh the epistle to
[50:50] the Ephesians is an epistle a letter of
[50:52] Paul to the Ephesians to the Corinthians
[50:55] but you're called to be the the Epistle
[50:57] of
[50:57] Christ the letter of Christ for as much
[51:01] as you're manifestly declared to be the
[51:02] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[51:04] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[51:07] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[51:10] but in the fleshly tables of the heart
[51:13] what are we supposed to do we're
[51:14] supposed to be his love letter his
[51:16] letter his epistle written to the world
[51:19] not with ink but with the spirit of the
[51:21] Living God not on Stone like it was on
[51:25] Mount Si but engraved in our
[51:27] hearts and we're to be a display of
[51:30] God's word now let's go over to First
[51:34] Corinthians chapter
[51:36] 11 verse
[51:43] 7 1 Corinthians 11:7 for a man that inde
[51:47] not not to cover his head for as much as
[51:49] he is the image and glory of God but the
[51:52] woman is the glory of the
[51:54] man amen the woman is the glory of the
[51:59] man
[52:03] amen what kind of Glory should we be for
[52:07] him the woman is the glory of the man
[52:10] when we talk about the two couples that
[52:12] brother brandham married the woman on
[52:15] the hill was a reflection of her
[52:16] husband's
[52:18] character and she was declaring to the
[52:21] world what kind of man she was married
[52:25] to but the woman down in the Box Car she
[52:29] was a reflection of her husband's love
[52:30] and sacrifice and surrender and she was
[52:33] sacrificing and surrendering and loving
[52:35] back she was his
[52:37] glory amen when I read that story and I
[52:40] and I see her response you just know she
[52:43] had a good
[52:44] husband you just know she had a good
[52:46] husband she had a husband she loved a
[52:48] husband she could trust a husband who
[52:50] sacrificed for a husband she could have
[52:52] confidence and you know she has a good
[52:53] husband how do you know she has a good
[52:55] husband because she's refle ref in her
[52:56] husband her character reflects his
[52:59] character her conduct towards him is a
[53:01] reflection of his conduct towards
[53:03] her amen and what kind of Glory am I
[53:06] bringing Christ in my life amen I want
[53:09] to be a written epistle I want to be
[53:11] read of all men I I desperately want the
[53:14] Holy Ghost to come and write in my heart
[53:16] that letter so it can manifest not my
[53:18] own Glory not my own desire but his
[53:21] glory I want to be the Lamb's wife I
[53:24] want to be a lamb
[53:27] Amen in the Masterpiece brother bam says
[53:29] notice the bride if the bride in the
[53:31] beginning was the word of the bridegroom
[53:33] and then if the bride is is taken from
[53:35] the bridegroom it must be the word also
[53:39] notice the bride must be why must the
[53:41] bridegroom be the word manifested made
[53:43] plain is because the bride and the
[53:45] bridegroom are one she is just a smitten
[53:47] piece off of him there is the
[53:50] Masterpiece she she must be a reflection
[53:53] of him if he was the word she must be
[53:56] the word word and now let's go to John
[53:59] chap 11 and I want to share with you
[54:01] this thing that I've been meditating on
[54:02] for
[54:06] weeks sometimes you just get a scripture
[54:08] in your mind and just roll over it and
[54:10] roll over it and roll over it and it
[54:11] begins to strike deeper and
[54:18] deeper in John 21 let's go to verse
[54:21] 18 and we know this is after the death
[54:25] burial resurrection of Jesus Christ he
[54:27] comes uh to find them fishing on the sea
[54:30] and he speaks to them and Peter swims
[54:32] the shore and all those then he starts
[54:33] to ask Peter Peter does thou lovest me
[54:36] more than these three times and he says
[54:38] feed my sheep then after that he speaks
[54:41] to to Peter again in verse 18 He says
[54:44] verily verily I say unto thee when thou
[54:46] was young thou Gest thyself and wst with
[54:49] thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old
[54:52] Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and
[54:54] another shall GD thee and carry thee
[54:57] G the Wither thou wouldest not he's
[54:59] speaking of his death because he's going
[55:01] to be crucified let's read that again
[55:05] say I say unto thee when thou was young
[55:06] thou Gest thyself and wst whether thou
[55:08] wouldest but when thou shalt be old Thou
[55:10] shalt stretch forth thy hands and
[55:12] another shall GD thee and carry thee
[55:14] whether thou wouldest not because he's
[55:16] going to be crucified for Christ look at
[55:19] verse 19 this spake he signifying by
[55:23] what death he should glorify God
[55:28] so interesting to
[55:30] me that phrase starts getting in my
[55:32] heart and I can't get it
[55:34] out signifying by what death he should
[55:38] glorify
[55:40] God you mean Peter was going to glorify
[55:44] God by
[55:47] death by being crucified by being turned
[55:50] over to authorities by being tried as a
[55:53] criminal and being crucified that's how
[55:57] he was going to glorify
[56:02] God I wonder by what death I could
[56:05] glorify
[56:06] God maybe by the death
[56:10] itself we think the only way to bring
[56:12] glory to God is through Supernatural
[56:15] Feats and through all these other things
[56:17] but there was a death that Peter could
[56:20] go through that would glorify God and
[56:23] not Peter
[56:27] I started meditating on
[56:29] that and saying by what death he should
[56:32] glorify God and the woman is the glory
[56:35] of the man and if Christ sacrificed
[56:39] himself for me then what should I do to
[56:42] glorify him maybe I should sacrifice
[56:45] myself for
[56:48] him maybe I should reflect the nature of
[56:51] the lamb be led by the dove even Into
[56:55] the Wilderness to be tempted by the
[56:57] devil even to face Temptation even to
[57:00] face trials even in good times and bad
[57:04] times in richer and in poorer and
[57:06] sickness and in health if Peter could
[57:09] die a certain death to glorify God can I
[57:13] go through a trial to glorify God can I
[57:16] go through a hard time to glorify God
[57:18] can can God take me through a valley to
[57:20] glorify God is there more than one way
[57:23] to get Glory out of my life amen he got
[57:26] Glory out of Peter's life certainly
[57:28] certainly when when he when he healed
[57:29] the lame man amen Peter gave glory to
[57:32] God and God got glory in that when he
[57:34] walked by and they were healed by a
[57:35] shadow falling on them God got glory in
[57:38] that but that wasn't the only way he got
[57:40] glory in Peter's life because there was
[57:42] a death in which he signified what way
[57:45] in his death he could glorify God and
[57:47] that means I can bring glory to God not
[57:49] just in my successes not just in just in
[57:53] Supernatural things but I can glorify
[57:55] God even in the way I submit and
[57:57] surrender to his leadership and will for
[57:59] my
[58:00] life if that's what pet Peter gets to
[58:03] the point God already told him about his
[58:05] death God told him what way in which he
[58:07] could glorify God that's why when you
[58:09] read I think it's in second Peter when
[58:11] Peter talks about his departure it's no
[58:13] big deal for him he said my departure is
[58:15] coming near it's time for me to leave
[58:17] why cuz he knew that that was going to
[58:19] be glorifying God and he submitted to it
[58:23] he wasn't backing down he wasn't
[58:25] complaining he wasn't n leaving the
[58:26] ministry he didn't decide not to believe
[58:28] in the Messiah
[58:32] anymore he didn't protect himself defend
[58:36] himself he submitted
[58:42] himself maybe there's a death for me
[58:46] that I can glorify
[58:48] God maybe there's a manner in which I
[58:51] can crucify my own
[58:53] flesh and bring glorify glorify God
[58:57] amen maybe it's in more ways than just
[59:01] one and then I I love what happens next
[59:04] it's always amazing to
[59:06] me he said verse 19 again thus spake he
[59:09] signifying by what death he should
[59:10] glorify God and when he had spoken this
[59:13] he saith unto him follow
[59:15] me then Peter turned about seeth the
[59:17] disciple whom Jesus loved following
[59:19] which also leaned on his breast at
[59:20] supper and said Lord which is he that
[59:24] betrayeth thee Peter SE seeing him
[59:26] sayith to Jesus Lord and what shall this
[59:28] man
[59:29] do Jesus sayith unto him if I will that
[59:32] he T till I come what is that to thee
[59:35] follow thou
[59:38] me do you know that John brought glory
[59:42] to God but not the same way Peter
[59:45] brought glory to
[59:46] God God signified by what death that
[59:50] Peter could glorify God but you know
[59:52] that John didn't have to be crucified
[59:54] and John didn't have to die a martyr
[59:56] John was the only one of the disciples
[59:57] could die of old age amen and you say
[1:00:00] well maybe he didn't glorify God no God
[1:00:02] had a different way in which he could
[1:00:04] glorify God and it was different than
[1:00:06] the way Peter could glorify God and
[1:00:08] Jesus ends up saying what is that to
[1:00:10] thee follow me it doesn't matter and you
[1:00:13] say God how come you heal them and don't
[1:00:15] heal me how come they have a nice family
[1:00:17] and I have family troubles how come
[1:00:18] that's a good church and I'm stuck in
[1:00:20] this situation why do they get a good
[1:00:22] job and I don't get a good job what is
[1:00:24] that to you follow him
[1:00:27] just surrender to the headship of your
[1:00:29] husband amen if you need a good job
[1:00:31] he'll give you a good job amen and if he
[1:00:33] gives you a job that has some degree of
[1:00:35] suffering say praise God maybe in my
[1:00:38] death in this job I can bring glory to
[1:00:40] God maybe in whatever he has to me let
[1:00:43] it be to the glory of God maybe through
[1:00:45] the trial I can bring more glory to him
[1:00:48] than maybe in a in a in arousing
[1:00:50] testimony of a supernatural ball of fire
[1:00:52] per maybe it's actually walking through
[1:00:54] this Valley and submitting and
[1:00:56] surrendering and keeping the right
[1:00:58] attitude amen maybe that's how he wants
[1:01:00] me to glorify him maybe somebody else
[1:01:03] will do it by laying hands on a lame man
[1:01:05] and they leap and jump and walk maybe
[1:01:07] that's how they bring glory to God but
[1:01:09] maybe God's designed for me to bring
[1:01:11] glory to him to suffer through
[1:01:12] tribulation and trial and and and act
[1:01:15] like a lamb yeah amen we don't
[1:01:20] know but we know that God
[1:01:22] knows amen
[1:01:26] what's that to thee Peter's saying well
[1:01:29] if I have to be crucified what does he
[1:01:32] get if this is how I'm going to glorify
[1:01:35] you what's he going to do to glorify
[1:01:38] you and Jesus said don't you worry about
[1:01:41] that don't you worry about that you
[1:01:43] follow me am oh what a that little bitty
[1:01:48] few few verses there had got me all
[1:01:50] stirred up inside amen God if I've got
[1:01:53] to die let me die if you've got if I
[1:01:56] need to die to this situation or die to
[1:01:58] that situation or Surrender my will in
[1:02:00] this or my preference in that let me
[1:02:03] crucify the flesh if that's how you want
[1:02:06] me to bring glory to your name then let
[1:02:08] me be willing like Peter was at the end
[1:02:10] of his life and say hey now it's time
[1:02:12] what he said is going to come to pass
[1:02:14] it's time for my
[1:02:16] departure cuz why I want to have the
[1:02:19] nature of the
[1:02:22] Lamb oh friends I don't know
[1:02:26] sometimes I don't know why I even preach
[1:02:28] like I preach I want to preach happy
[1:02:30] things and and we're all this and that
[1:02:32] but there's a reality to our life amen
[1:02:35] and and the the when Jesus was on Earth
[1:02:38] amen he had campaigns and he had
[1:02:40] healings and they followed after and
[1:02:41] they wanted him but they also mocked him
[1:02:43] and made fun of him and spit on him and
[1:02:45] rejected him and took him in a mock
[1:02:47] trial and false accusations and and they
[1:02:49] and they rejected him as a whole nation
[1:02:51] and and they hung him on a cross and and
[1:02:53] and you talk about wholesale rejection
[1:02:56] amen but he submitted to
[1:03:00] it it wasn't
[1:03:03] always you know he glorified his father
[1:03:08] not just in the healing but also on
[1:03:14] Calvary when he was spit on and didn't
[1:03:16] spit back when he was riled against and
[1:03:18] didn't R back he was bringing glory to
[1:03:20] his
[1:03:23] father and we know testimonies bring
[1:03:25] glory to God we know the supernatural in
[1:03:28] our life brings glory to God and we want
[1:03:32] that but maybe our surrender and
[1:03:34] sacrifice also brings glory to God maybe
[1:03:38] our submission to the headship of the
[1:03:40] word even when it goes against the
[1:03:43] desire of the
[1:03:44] flesh glorifies
[1:03:47] God maybe when I submit myself to the
[1:03:51] headship of Christ and deny myself
[1:03:56] you know what I'm doing I'm reflecting
[1:03:58] the nature of the Lamb right because
[1:04:01] when Christ was on earth when Jesus
[1:04:03] Christ was here he surrendered to the
[1:04:06] will of the father and he only did that
[1:04:08] which the father showed
[1:04:11] himen and he goes to Gethsemane and he's
[1:04:14] wrestling with himself and brother bam
[1:04:17] brother bam so depicts it so beautifully
[1:04:19] if it wasn't for the prophet of God we
[1:04:21] wouldn't be able to say these things but
[1:04:23] the prophet of God says he's wrestling
[1:04:25] out will he will he go to Calvary or
[1:04:28] will he stay with his disciples what he
[1:04:30] wanted to
[1:04:31] do what he wanted to do he he himself
[1:04:35] wanted to stay with his disciples he
[1:04:36] didn't want the separation he didn't
[1:04:38] want the pain and suffering that came
[1:04:40] but or would he obey the father or would
[1:04:42] he stay with the disciples and do that's
[1:04:44] what he wanted to do but he wrestled it
[1:04:45] out till he says not my will but thine
[1:04:47] be done and what was he doing he's
[1:04:49] bringing glory to the
[1:04:51] father I say God let me bring Glory to
[1:04:58] you sometimes what's hard is he doesn't
[1:05:01] tell us ahead of
[1:05:03] time he told Peter when you're old
[1:05:06] you'll somebody else will G you they'll
[1:05:08] take you where you want to go they'll
[1:05:09] stretch your arms out and signifying
[1:05:12] what measure he might die by how he
[1:05:14] might glorify
[1:05:16] God sometimes he doesn't tell us ahead
[1:05:18] of time that you're going to go through
[1:05:20] a hard time and you're going to suffer
[1:05:21] and you're going to suffer a long time
[1:05:23] but the way you suffer is going to bring
[1:05:24] glory to me
[1:05:26] yeah the way you die
[1:05:30] listen if we remain on this Earth much
[1:05:33] longer before the translation of the
[1:05:36] body many of us are going to
[1:05:40] die make your death glorify
[1:05:44] God die in faith die believing die in
[1:05:49] Joy looking forward to step to the next
[1:05:51] Dimension glorify God in death glorify
[1:05:54] God in life glor glorify God in High
[1:05:56] Times glorify God in the low times
[1:05:58] glorify God in much glorify God without
[1:06:01] much glorify God in sickness glorify God
[1:06:04] in
[1:06:05] health that's right
[1:06:08] amen wa what right do we have to
[1:06:10] complain what right do we have to get
[1:06:13] selfish what right that's not the nature
[1:06:15] of the lamb and that's not what he's
[1:06:17] called us to reflect and we are the
[1:06:19] glory the woman's the glory of the man I
[1:06:20] want to bring glory to my husband and I
[1:06:23] want to bring glory to him by reflecting
[1:06:25] back to him his character because the
[1:06:27] kind of wife a man chooses reflects
[1:06:29] what's in him what his nature is and
[1:06:31] what he thinks of his future home and I
[1:06:33] believe by all my heart he's chose me so
[1:06:35] he must know that there's something down
[1:06:37] inside of me that can reflect his nature
[1:06:40] and so I know the potentials are there I
[1:06:42] just have to surrender myself and die to
[1:06:44] myself and say God by the power of your
[1:06:47] Holy Ghost would you bring out the
[1:06:48] reflection of you that must be in me
[1:06:51] because you chose me I didn't choose
[1:06:53] me you called me I didn't call me bride
[1:06:57] you said you're coming to unite with me
[1:06:59] you've come to me I didn't come to you
[1:07:01] all I did was say yay Lord that's what I
[1:07:04] want amen now I know that the wife you
[1:07:06] choose reflects what's inside of you and
[1:07:09] what you're thinking of your future home
[1:07:11] so God inside of me is your
[1:07:15] choice bring it to the surface Lord I
[1:07:18] Surrender Lord I Surrender bring it to
[1:07:21] the surface you know what we need we
[1:07:23] need we need the Holy Ghost to move in
[1:07:24] our lives every every day because this
[1:07:26] isn't something we can do on ourselves
[1:07:28] this isn't sure willpower this is
[1:07:30] something that we must resign ourselves
[1:07:32] to and say God I've got to die today
[1:07:34] I've got to Die Tomorrow I've got to Die
[1:07:36] the next day but you've got to come and
[1:07:38] live your own life because if not I'll
[1:07:40] be the wrong kind of reflection of your
[1:07:42] life and I don't want to hinder I don't
[1:07:46] want to bring a bag Mark against your
[1:07:52] name this this eve of the last is not
[1:07:56] going to
[1:07:57] fail because she's predestinated not
[1:08:00] to Something's already inside of
[1:08:04] her and he sent his word to draw it
[1:08:08] out I say
[1:08:12] God whatever glorifies your
[1:08:16] name let me glorify your
[1:08:19] name and the
[1:08:22] Masterpiece he says now closing in a few
[1:08:26] minutes I want you to notice real close
[1:08:27] of something that just happened Malachi
[1:08:30] 4 is to bring back to the original she
[1:08:33] is smitten from the church from the
[1:08:35] church body smitten with her master for
[1:08:37] the same purpose she is the word just
[1:08:39] the same as Joseph was smitten from his
[1:08:41] Brethren because he was the word and
[1:08:43] Jesus was smitten from his Brethren
[1:08:44] because he was the word the church is
[1:08:46] smitten the bride is smitten from the
[1:08:47] church because she is the word there's
[1:08:50] your stages again the word living in an
[1:08:53] action the Bible bride not some man made
[1:08:55] bride the Bible bride smitten and
[1:08:58] Afflicted of God now listen he goes
[1:09:00] right to Isaiah 53 which is speaking of
[1:09:03] Jesus which is speaking of the lamb and
[1:09:06] he applies it to the bride now he says
[1:09:08] the bride the Bible bride smitten and
[1:09:10] Afflicted of God no Beauty we should
[1:09:13] desire her but yet we did esteem her
[1:09:15] smitten and Afflicted of God that's
[1:09:18] right she stands alone she is smitten
[1:09:21] from all the denominations according to
[1:09:23] Revelation 3 she is smitten out of the
[1:09:25] lateran Church age that she was raised
[1:09:27] up in that's the church was raised up in
[1:09:29] the lateran church age that's the husk
[1:09:32] what you saying he says she is smitten
[1:09:35] and Afflicted of
[1:09:37] God rejected in the church AE rejected
[1:09:41] from the denominations and that's how he
[1:09:44] wants to be glorified in her in her
[1:09:48] rejection amen he was
[1:09:50] rejected will be
[1:09:53] rejected if he was the word
[1:09:55] we must be the word if the word's been
[1:09:58] rejected and ridiculed and mocked and
[1:10:01] made fun of and discredited then what do
[1:10:04] you think we should expect in our
[1:10:07] lives but if my husband is poor then I'm
[1:10:11] happy being
[1:10:13] poor if my husband is Rich I'm
[1:10:17] rich if my husband's going through a
[1:10:19] good time I'm going through a good time
[1:10:21] if he's going through a bad time I'm
[1:10:22] going through a bad time why because
[1:10:25] I've surrendered my life to him my
[1:10:28] identity is wrapped up in him if the
[1:10:30] word was rejected then I'll be
[1:10:34] rejected why because I'm part of
[1:10:38] him in the good
[1:10:40] times and in the bad
[1:10:45] times in Romans
[1:10:47] 8:35 let's turn there together I want to
[1:10:50] read just two more scriptures and we'll
[1:10:51] close
[1:10:57] Romans
[1:11:03] 8:35 says who shall separate us from the
[1:11:06] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:11:10] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:11:14] nakedness or Peril or
[1:11:18] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[1:11:21] are killed all the day long we are
[1:11:24] counted as sheep for the
[1:11:27] slaughter let's read it again you care
[1:11:30] if we go back and read it one more time
[1:11:33] I love asking that because I mean I
[1:11:34] don't think you're going to say no you
[1:11:36] might say it in your heart but not out
[1:11:39] loud because we think about being
[1:11:41] married to Christ and being healed and
[1:11:43] being rich and having the cattle on a
[1:11:45] thousand hills but but let's actually
[1:11:48] read what Paul
[1:11:49] says who shall separate us from the love
[1:11:52] of God shall tribulation or distress or
[1:11:55] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:11:57] Peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:12:00] sake we are killed all the day
[1:12:03] long we are counted as sheep for the
[1:12:07] slaughter he's a lamb we're Lambs amen
[1:12:12] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:12:15] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:12:18] I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[1:12:20] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:12:22] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:12:24] come nor height nor death nor any other
[1:12:26] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:12:28] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:12:30] Jesus our
[1:12:31] lord if none of those things will
[1:12:34] separate us from his love amen will we
[1:12:36] separate ourselves from him because of
[1:12:38] these things or will we stay with him in
[1:12:41] his love and Peril and nakedness and
[1:12:45] sword and being counted as sheep for the
[1:12:47] slaughter all the day long will we stay
[1:12:50] United with him if he goes to the Cross
[1:12:52] will we go to the cross
[1:12:55] if he goes into trial and tribulation
[1:12:57] will we go into trial will we let the
[1:12:58] dove lead us into the Wilderness to be
[1:13:00] tempted by the devil to bring glory to
[1:13:02] God or we say no that's not what I
[1:13:05] signed up
[1:13:08] for we go back to our
[1:13:12] vows I take thee Lord Jesus to be my
[1:13:17] wetted husband to have in to hold from
[1:13:19] this day forward for better for worse
[1:13:23] for richer for poor and sickness and in
[1:13:26] health to love and to
[1:13:29] cherish I want all of that to be true in
[1:13:32] my love back to
[1:13:34] him nothing will separate his love from
[1:13:37] me I don't want anything to separate my
[1:13:39] love back for
[1:13:41] him let's go to Philippians chapter
[1:13:49] 3 Philippians chap 3:4
[1:13:59] Philippians 3 and4 though I might also
[1:14:02] have confidence in the flesh if any
[1:14:04] other man thinketh that he have whereof
[1:14:06] he might Trust In the Flesh I more
[1:14:08] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[1:14:10] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a
[1:14:12] Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the
[1:14:14] law a Pharisee concerning Zeal
[1:14:16] persecuting the church touching the
[1:14:18] righteousness which is the law
[1:14:20] blameless but what things were gained to
[1:14:22] me those I counted loss for Christ
[1:14:25] yay doubtless and I count all things but
[1:14:28] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:14:30] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:14:32] suffered the loss of all things that do
[1:14:34] count them but dung that I may win
[1:14:40] Christ what else do we want in this
[1:14:44] life but
[1:14:47] him and what else do we want to do in
[1:14:49] this life but glorify him and there's
[1:14:52] nothing else I desire but to glorify him
[1:14:57] and to reflect his nature amen but I
[1:15:00] know that it's going to take God coming
[1:15:03] and helping me but I believe that's the
[1:15:06] hour we live in isn't it not isn't this
[1:15:09] the hour for him to manifest himself in
[1:15:12] Bride form isn't that the hour we're
[1:15:15] living in is it we we we've talked about
[1:15:18] it so much we know that it's true but we
[1:15:20] were seeing it in power in demonstration
[1:15:23] in Revelation and all of these things
[1:15:26] but but to me if I'm going to see it
[1:15:28] there I've also got to see it in
[1:15:30] suffering and in rejection and in
[1:15:32] submission and in a lamb
[1:15:35] nature it's got to be both if I'm going
[1:15:38] to be his bride if I'm going to be his
[1:15:39] wife I've got to be able to take both
[1:15:41] sides everything that he is I am
[1:15:44] everything he goes through I go through
[1:15:46] amen his rejection is my rejection his
[1:15:49] success is my
[1:15:51] success and I want to be his glory and I
[1:15:55] want to glorify his name on this Earth
[1:15:57] the only way I can do it is to reflect
[1:15:59] back his character while I'm in this
[1:16:01] earth I never saw Jesus complained to
[1:16:04] God when somebody rejected
[1:16:07] him I never saw him complain to God When
[1:16:10] Trials came when he went to the
[1:16:13] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil I
[1:16:14] didn't see him blaming God or
[1:16:16] complaining to God I saw him submitting
[1:16:18] to the leadership of the dove and and
[1:16:20] obeying his father in all
[1:16:23] things did we see as a man wrestle in
[1:16:26] Geth yes he was a human being he
[1:16:28] wrestled in Gethsemane did we seem tired
[1:16:30] and need to all those things are true
[1:16:32] but but he submitted to the we will of
[1:16:35] the father and to the leadership of the
[1:16:36] father and what was he on Earth he was a
[1:16:38] reflection of his
[1:16:39] father he was God in flesh reflecting
[1:16:43] the very life of God what are we on this
[1:16:45] Earth the reflection of Jesus Christ Our
[1:16:47] husband and I want to be a good
[1:16:49] reflection you know the kind of wife I
[1:16:51] want to be the Box Car wife
[1:16:56] the Box Car wife I I'm okay I'm fine
[1:17:00] Lord everything you give me is wonderful
[1:17:03] I'm happy with you I'm happy with what
[1:17:06] you give me I'm pleased with the
[1:17:07] decisions you make for me I'm happy with
[1:17:10] your leadership I trust in you and I
[1:17:12] know whatever you lead is best and I'm
[1:17:14] giving all my faith and trust into you I
[1:17:16] want to be a box car wife I don't want
[1:17:19] to reflect the wrong
[1:17:21] nature amen let's all Stand Together
[1:17:25] there's many many more things that were
[1:17:26] on my heart but I'm going to save that
[1:17:28] for another
[1:17:33] time and just say that there's no
[1:17:36] way there's no way that a lamb can be
[1:17:40] married to a
[1:17:43] wolf there's no way the poor man from
[1:17:46] the box guard could have married the
[1:17:48] rich girl on the
[1:17:49] hill cuz he had to pick a wife that
[1:17:51] reflected his nature that's why Christ
[1:17:54] could couldn't take a modern
[1:17:55] denominational to be his wife that's
[1:17:57] what brother Benham said he couldn't do
[1:17:59] it he had to take one that would reflect
[1:18:02] his nature that would be humble and
[1:18:04] submissive and have faith and trust in
[1:18:07] him amen I'm so glad that he chose me I
[1:18:12] don't feel worthy of it and I don't feel
[1:18:14] like I'm I'm a good reflection but I
[1:18:16] know if I surrender to his life he'll
[1:18:18] come and do things in me that I can't do
[1:18:21] myself all I need to do is surrender to
[1:18:24] him
[1:18:25] I don't need to take it into my own
[1:18:27] hands I don't need to solve my own
[1:18:28] problems what I need to do is trust in
[1:18:31] him and let him
[1:18:33] lead amen let's bow our heads
[1:18:36] together dear heavenly father we thank
[1:18:38] you God for this
[1:18:40] day and Lord
[1:18:42] Jesus you told Peter by what death he
[1:18:46] can glorify
[1:18:48] you God it's an amazing scripture to
[1:18:51] me that things that look negative can
[1:18:55] bring glory to your
[1:18:57] name things that look
[1:18:59] bad can be a way in which we can bring
[1:19:02] glory to your name things that the world
[1:19:05] would call
[1:19:07] tragedy maybe a
[1:19:09] failure but God those are ways in which
[1:19:12] we can glorify your
[1:19:14] name when Peter would be tried as a
[1:19:18] criminal rejected by governments hung on
[1:19:22] a cross to die
[1:19:25] the world would call that
[1:19:27] failure but that's how you chose that he
[1:19:29] would glorify
[1:19:31] you God I I don't know what you have
[1:19:34] planned for our
[1:19:36] lives but God may we pledge ourselves to
[1:19:39] you for better and for worse for richer
[1:19:44] and for poor and sickness and in
[1:19:48] health Lord I'm sorry for pulling back
[1:19:51] in bad
[1:19:53] times when I got
[1:19:55] discouraged got
[1:19:58] down sorry
[1:20:01] Lord there even times Lord I tried to
[1:20:04] fix things myself and I didn't trust you
[1:20:06] like I
[1:20:08] should I wasn't as submissive as should
[1:20:10] have been when you said no I tried to
[1:20:14] find my own
[1:20:15] way and I'm sorry
[1:20:18] Lord but I want Lord with all my heart
[1:20:22] to be a lamb
[1:20:25] yes Lord I believe you've called me to
[1:20:27] be your bride in this hour I believe it
[1:20:30] lord I can't help but believe
[1:20:32] it God if I lay my life down would you
[1:20:36] pick it up and use it for your glory if
[1:20:39] I surrender to you would you get Glory
[1:20:41] out of my life
[1:20:43] Lord and God I pray that you encourage
[1:20:45] my
[1:20:46] faith draw out of me Lord all the
[1:20:49] attributes you've placed in and help me
[1:20:51] to be shaped into your very image to
[1:20:52] grow into your stature to the fullness
[1:20:55] of you
[1:20:56] Lord God may I be a reflection on this
[1:20:59] Earth of your life Lord and help me Lord
[1:21:01] to stay submissive and trusting to
[1:21:05] reflect you on this Earth to say Lord
[1:21:08] your way is the right way and your will
[1:21:10] is the best and what you choose is what

[1:21:22] Lord God there's times I've acted fussy
[1:21:25] and

[1:21:30] because I recognize every choice you've
[1:21:32] made for me is the right
[1:21:34] choice and every Valley you've took me
[1:21:37] through was needful and every trial was
[1:21:40] on purpose with an intent For Your Glory
[1:21:44] for my shaping to be molded into your
[1:21:47] image and I say God I'm thankful for
[1:21:50] everything that you have allowed in my

[1:22:21] of your work in your Earthly Journey but
[1:22:24] you left some of it to do in and through
[1:22:26] your
[1:22:27] bride God I want to surrender to you so
[1:22:29] that you can finish that work in this
[1:22:31] day and that you can get all the

[1:22:38] Jesus for your mercy for your
[1:22:41] graciousness God how can we not be
[1:22:44] patient in trial when you've been so
[1:22:45] patient with
[1:22:47] us how can we not endure with what you
[1:22:50] allow when you've endured with us for
[1:22:53] years and years years you've been

[1:23:28] for you had a path for Peter and a way
[1:23:30] at the end of his life he could glorify
[1:23:32] you but it was different for John and
[1:23:35] may each one of us maybe have a
[1:23:37] different way in which our surrender and
[1:23:39] our sacrifice of ourselves can bring
[1:23:41] glory to you but God help us not to look
[1:23:45] to the other help us not to
[1:23:48] compare but help us to look to you only
[1:23:51] and trust in you
[1:23:52] only for Lord all that you do is good
[1:23:55] and all that you do is right and you
[1:23:57] have a purpose and a plan in it
