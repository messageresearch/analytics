night with brother gene petrie and many of you know that sister maryland had fallen and injured her knee again she had a knee surgery and she had fallen and injured it she went in monday and had a knee surgery and the surgery went well they found where a part of that knee replacement was loose they fixed it and went well she's feeling better she can walk on it but while they were in there they found that there's infection there so they've kept her in the hospital they've got her own strong antibiotics and they want to get rid of that infection so i'd like for us to join together in prayer that god will deliver her from that infection and she can go home and heal up and walk and enjoy her mobility and enjoy her healing so let's bow our heads together and pray dear lord jesus we thank you lord we thank you for the privilege lord of being able to bow our heads and say that we love you lord billions of people on this earth lord but it's us that you've called lord it's us that you've chosen and god we just love you so much and we thank you god for your provision for your healing for your deliverance for all that you've done for us by your word and god we just want to lift our sister marilyn petrie to you lord you've been so good to her lord you took care of her through this surgery and the pain that she had in her knee is so much better she's able to walk on the lord we thank you for that and god they found an infection lord and the enemy is trying lord to bring more harm to our sister but we pray in jesus name lord that you would heal her and deliver her from that infection and god may we bind that spirit now in jesus christ's name leave our sister alone thou evil spirit god may you just move on her behalf and heal her body and bring her body subject to her confession in the word that by your stripes sister maryland is already healed norm while we just pray now that you would give her a quick recovery may she go home soon recover at home and make she feel well lord and be strengthened and have a good mobility and may she enjoy her healing we ask lord now as we turn to your word i pray god that you would just speak through this vessel for your glory let us have that portion of the word you reserved for this hour for this time that we have need of lord and i just pray god that you would break the bread yourself and fetus of your own hand for we're your sheep oh and we've come to you the great shepherd and god i pray that you would just lead us into green pastures where we can grow strong and healthy on the good word we ask that you would take every part of this service under your control and have preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you all while you're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the book of isaiah we're going to continue on with the same thought we've been dealing with the last three services but i just want to mention to you the weekend meetings coming up i want you to keep that in top of your mind as you're praying pray for the ministers that will be traveling in brother marcus will be arriving lord willing tomorrow brother steven shimba will be coming in on friday brother marcus will have the evening services friday evening saturday evening brother stephen lord willing will have the morning services saturday morning and sunday morning so i just want you to remember that be praying for those be praying for the meetings we know we know how this works come expecting because brother branham said you get what you expect amen so let's come with great expectation also there's going to be a a good number of visitors coming from brother stevens church they wanted to come up and join us in fellowship so i think besides him and his wife they have 11 others that are coming so make sure you greet them in the foyer and say hi to them they're going to be staying through till sunday so if you want to have fellowship with them they're going to be brothers and sisters coming up from south carolina so you might want to remember them on sunday afternoon amen let's look at isaiah 55 verse 11. if you remember this was the verse we ended with on sunday so i'd like to start there and as we've been going through this i i never expected to preach on this uh this long this subject but it seems impossible to find the period at the end of the service so god just keeps opening more and opening more so we're just going to trust him and keep walking the path that he has for us in isaiah 55 11 it says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it amen god bless you can you be seated now we'll ask the lord to bless the reading of his word i want to look at this again it just it just struck me we've known the scripture for many years and looked at it but it says so shall my word that so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return into me void and that means that the word is going to return unto him but it won't return void amen the word comes out from him but the word will return to him but the word will not return void but along the way in the journey of the word the word will accomplish everything that he's determined for it to accomplish so jesus is the lord's saying here that it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sin it so he sent out his word to accomplish something and that word will not return unto him void brother benham said in christ is the mystery of god revealed we've read this quote each time so it's very familiar now it says now you see the seals when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and i hope as we're going through the series as for me i realized that so many times i get hung up on the symbols and i start to see pictures in my mind of symbols but i start to miss the deeper meaning of what those symbols represent amen so when we when we think of the book of life and the lamb's book of life amen we realize brother ben is telling us now in christ as the mystery of god revealed that all that's in the book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him so we know that this this book is him and all the words in the book are the believers and the word is him so we're not we're not talking about paper we're not talking about uh uh pieces of paper we're talking about we're talking about a thought god had a record in god's thoughts something he was going to achieve some purpose that he had in his mind and and he had a desire before the foundation of the world and that book was going to be the record of god becoming material or god becoming as the word because the word was with god and the word was god amen and we know eventually that word and whole was made flesh and dwelt among us and what was it it was elohim it was god with us amen so as that would god would manifest himself portion by portion by portion there was going to be a record of that manifestation as god was manifesting himself and every time that word came into manifestation the anointed word manifested for that day that was christ so that's what this book is recording amen now when we we look at the smyrna church age here in the church age book this quote says watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was gone so now we're going to go way way way way back amen the prophet of god can take us way back he can take us way far ahead and he can take us way way back amen brother franco if you can bring up the white board for me uh he says before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god and then he goes on and he adds god is an object of adoration no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially god so he's explaining what he means by before god was gone and it says and he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not so all the way back before brother bannon said before there was a speck of stardust we had elohim the self-existing one brother ben says at this point he was not even god yet because god is an object of worship but there was nothing yet to worship him and he said in this state before there was anything to worship him that means before the heavens were created and the heavenly host was created amen the bride was already in his mind so you amen as an attribute of god you are eternal as god is eternal and when i say you i'm not talking about you that had natural birth i'm not talking about you and this concept of flesh but i'm talking about that sieging of god that was always meant to be you from the beginning that was in your soul that part of god amen that was already with him so that part existed before there was cherubims before there was a heavenly host of angels and seraphims and all of those things before that with that portion of god that dwells in your soul tonight was there in his thinking so before god was god before there was one speck of stardust amen this this what brother venom is teaching us after the opening of the seals what he is explaining to us when he can go back further back before the heavens were created back before the angelic host was formed back when god was alone with his thoughts he can take us all the way back there so that we can find there our origin amen and if you can find your origin there amen nothing else that comes after that amen can take you out of the thinking of god it brings such a security if you can catch a revelation that i'm one of them amen that by the grace of god i've got a revelation a personal revelation of jesus christ to me that i can say i'm one of them if you say there was attributes the bride was already in his thinking as attributes as thoughts amen i believe by revelation i'm part of the bride placing me back there amen and that part of me existed before angels existed amen so in order for elohim to become god he creates the whole heavenly realm so he creates the whole heavenly realm and when he creates the whole heavenly realm there's all kinds of beings in this heavenly realm there's cherubim seraphim archangels angels there's all kinds of stuff but whenever he created that then elohim became god i hope that doesn't stumble anybody that says brother ben i'm explaining because god is an object of worship so before the heavenly realm was created amen if you're part of the bride you were already there in his thinking if you were already there in his thinking then what is going to defeat you now in a creation that came not even the next thing that was created the heavenly realm but then after that the earthly realm was created and what on this earthly realm is going to defeat you because god cannot be defeated so after he created the heavenly realm he created the earthly realm and brother benham tells us that this earth he said it is the negative that the heavenly is the positive he said if you see here a tree struggling to live there's a tree somewhere else that doesn't struggle to live you see here a man struggling for life it shows that there's a man somewhere else that doesn't struggle to live he said this is that this is the negative that is the positive this now is a as a negative reflection of that realm amen so that when brother benham goes beyond the curtain of time and goes into the sixth dimension when he goes there he sees grass there's air there's there's there's a sky and then there's hills there's things that we see on earth amen we see grass and hills and sky and people but when brother branham went beyond the current of time to the sixth dimension he sees grass and hills amen and he sees people and he sees the sky and the question was where was grass first where was grass first amen it was in the heavenly dimension now when we show these two dimensions this is just a way of of separating the two dimensions they actually go together one's just moving at a faster speed than the other it's not like there's great distances apart it's not like heaven's way up there and earth is down here heaven and earth are together amen amen one's just moving at a faster speed than the other one and that one moving at a faster speed has people and it has trees and it has the streams it has grass it has hills but before any of that you existed in the thoughts of god so that means we know that i'll just draw this here sin originated in heaven is that right and then lucifer and his angels were cast out and come to earth then sin broke out in the earth is that right and now we come in this earthly journey we come in a sin cursed body and a sin cursed earth and when we come born wrong amen with the wrong nature and the wrong spirit and all of that and we have to come through a cycle of redemption but i just want you to know that before lucifer sinned i was here before there was an adversary i was in his thinking before there was a luther lucifer before sin ever broke out i existed somewhere amen in the thought of god because thought god's thoughts are eternal god's thoughts are real brother branham said god's thoughts are not like a blueprint where you write it on paper and then you've got to build amen to match the thought the thought is already real everything else is a lower reflection of the real but when man has a thought he writes it on the blueprint and when he materializes it becomes a greater expression of his thought amen but for god the thought is the most real and everything else becomes a reflection amen and i would say maybe an inferior reflection i don't know but before there was sin before there was lucifer before sin broke out in heaven amen you already had existence because if you are part of the thinking of god if you're part of the word of god if you're an attribute of god amen then you already have eternal life you are as eternal as god is eternal amen so so this is this is uh where i just want to begin from and move from there before there was a speck of stardust before god was god he was only he was only known as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind so let's just do it like this before all of this when we just have elohim the book was already in his mind i draw it as a book the old testament describes it or the new testament describes it as a scroll amen because that's the form the book had then i'm just drawing a book just so you need you know what i'm talking about this book of life was already in his thinking this book of life was already with him amen because it was a record of eternal life and all that was there at that time was eternal life when elohim was elohim before he was god all that had existed then was eternal life amen and so then when he created the heavens amen we know that even some of the heavenly beings that he created will not have eternal life because there's a lake of fire that they will be cast into and destroyed so their life will be terminated at some point so even the heavenly host will have an end to life amen and then then lucifer had a beginning to his creation he has an end to his creation amen but you as a son or daughter of god have no beginning to your creation and have no end to your creation that is the eternal life record that's contained within the book of life so the thing that i want us to see and i've been saying this it's not the first time i say this but i want us to see how secure we are in god and how perfect god's plan is i want to go in and read a couple more quotes here and in the first seal he says you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book the bible was really written before the foundation of the world and christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names were in there and all about it so before there was even a foundation to this world amen your name if you're part of god part of the bride was already recorded in this book so you're existence predated the earth that you're walking on you can pick up dirt amen you can touch a rock you can go back and see you know the the most ancient rock the oldest rocks amen that they can find on the earth and you realize that before that rock was formed your name was on the book of life before that rock was formed and so we feel like that rock of solid and this earth is solid amen and these things aren't changing we feel like these things are the solid elements standing up on the earth the solid rocks the things that don't change we realize these things amen are going to be transformed by fire amen but we existed before the rock in the mind of god every the members of his bride their names were put in the last book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up it's been sealed all the way but now it's unsealed friends it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed now that's what brother branham said it's been sealed up but now it's being revealed whose names were in there and all about it amen at the opening of the seals god begins to take the veil off and begin to show us that stream of life coming all the way down through and show us that book of life coming all the way down through let's look at genesis 18 together genesis 18 verse 16. and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the lord said shall i hide from abraham the thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him and you know paul the apostle picks up this all nations will be blessed in abraham and shows that god preached the gospel unto abraham knowing that all nations would be blessed in him because he would bring salvation unto the heathen which would be considered by faith children of abraham and now when god is speaking to abraham the father of faith the father of us all by faith when he speaks to abraham he said shall he said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do and now all of a sudden you realize when god comes to the father of faith to abraham who now has the promise who we who paul says is heir of the world now when he comes to him he says shall i hide anything from abraham saying he surely will become a mighty nation and all nations shall be blessed in him but listen friends we come right down that same promise right down that same lineage and i would like to say this that when god goes to reveal anything he doesn't hide it from the seed of abraham and now at the end time when god goes to show us the end time seal amen in the wrapping up of all things amen will god hide it from the seed of abraham that thing that he shall do so now we know who the revelation comes to let's go over to revelation chapter 10. we know it by heart but we're going to read it together revelation chapter 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets he says in the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the seals revealing christ amen praise god i'm going to move this picture over so he's the one who opened the seals he is those seals he is the mystery of god amen christ is the mystery of god revealed the mystery that was sealed up is revealed in christ christ is the mystery as it's been coming through because christ is the word the anointed word made manifest in that day that's christ so christ is the mystery of god revealed now he says in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed i want to read this quote it's a long quote so stay with me he says now for a text i want to take out of there this for a text basing it upon the entire bible but i want i want us to title this christ is the mystery of god revealed so now brother branham we know this super well but now he's going to preach christ is the mystery of god revealed he's going to take out of there a text but he's going to base it on the entire bible so the entire bible amen is revealed as in christ is the mystery of god revealed christ being the mystery of god revealed now i took it in the order of a sunday school lesson so we could all read together and have this fellowship together now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it so i want to come back here i i hold off with this too quick back when he was elohim back when god was alone in his thoughts he had something he wanted to achieve that's what brother ben says he says uh now he says now god's great secret he had before the world began back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star adam molecule anything he was god but exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so back when god was elohim the self-existing one alone with his thoughts amen he had a he had formulated a plan he had a desire a way in which he could be expressed a way in which he could express himself amen and so when he began to create his creation was going to be reflecting this thought that he had a way in which he could express himself for the whole purpose was for this great self-existing one who dwelt alone to express himself because he wanted fellowship so in order to have fellowship he was going to come in a multiplied form so that his attributes could fellowship together as a family of god upon the earth so in order to do that he wanted each part of this attribute each part of himself to have a comprehension and understanding he wanted a way to fully express himself amen for and give a full revelation of himself and unite himself together and have fellowship together upon the earth so god formulated a plan and the first thing he did in this plan is he created the heavens and he created angelic beings and he created these things that would worship him and when they began to worship him he became god he became the object of worship and he started his plan there amen and at some point he formulated an earth amen we don't know exactly when he began to formulate the earth and what exactly happened before genesis 1 1 and rpg before genesis between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2 that he formed the heavens and then he formed the earth and we realized that before before there was one speck of stardust before there was an atom before there was anything that's what brother branham said god already had a plan he already had written the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world so god already knew that there would be a lamb slain for redemption purposes meaning god already knew there was going to be a fall but listen sin did not originate on earth sin originated in heaven so god when he was making the heavenly host he already knew there was going to be sin in heaven because he made the heavenly host before he made the earthly host and before he made the earthly creation he already had a book written the lamb's book of life and he already had a plan of redemption amen because there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world god knew that's why amen that's why none of lucifer's plans will ever stop god's plan lucifer plan is working into god's plan that's why we are not afraid of the devil the devil brother branham said is a tool in god's hand for bringing out amen all of his plan everything he wants to express he needed an adversary he needed a backdrop of black so that the white of his righteousness would stand down so that he could express himself amen so god knew there would be a fall before he created the earth before there was one speck of stardust amen he knew there would be a fall because he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world so the devil is a tool in the god in the tool in god's hand so that god can express himself because he could not express healer unless something was sick he could not express savior unless something was lost he could not express his power as one who could restore unless there was something that needed restored all right we understand that concept so now before all of that god already had a plan so lucifer amen although what lucifer did was terrible it was absolutely terrible what happened in the heavenly realms and the rebellion against god it was horrible amen but it didn't stop god's plan all it did was move his plan into further action because when lucifer was cast out he came to the earth and some time later he brought his deception amen into the garden of eden and what happened in the garden of eden was also terrible is that right but what happened in the garden of eden was terrible amen but it didn't stop god's plan it moved god's plan into further manifestation because we've got to get down to this lamb slain before the foundation of the world so when man foul man set up the need for redemption when he set up the need for redemption now he set up the need for the lamb but the lamb was already slain in god's mind before the foundation of the world so just lock this away in the in the safe of your mind that nothing that the devil's doing can stop god's plan the only thing he can do is be used as the tool in the hand of god to move god's plan further along so when the devil comes against you amen and you feel amen the press and you feel the the attack amen he cannot thwart god's word he cannot overcome god's purpose he cannot stop god from expressing and manifesting himself the way he desired before there was one molecule before there was heaven when he was alone and as elohim he already had a thought to express himself and now you're here as part of that expression to express part of him and nothing the devil can do can stop that expression nothing it was determined before there was a lucifer before lucifer became the devil it was already determined so when you feel the press and you feel the battle and you feel everything just realize god's expressing amen god is expressing and if the devil is given any amen any ability amen to press you or to try you just realize that god is expressing and don't be afraid of those things i think the worst thing that plagues us is fear and the the seals came open to give us amen a revelation all the way back before there was anything else created that can harm us to show us how secure we are to take away fear amen because the thing that's tripping us up and shutting us down the thing that's inhibiting us is fear amen and there is no reason to be afraid that's what the revelation under the seals showed us that there's no reason to be afraid amen praise god i'm going to keep reading here in christ is the mystery of god reveal so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be father and him was to be son in him was to be savior in him was to be healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshipped him and that made him god and he started from there as in previous message i've tried to explain it to break it down and now when angels begin to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun nor no moon nor stars no nothing then he was god as he asked job where was you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shout out for joy see now where were you that was way back before the earth way back before the earth the sons of god were already singing and shouting in the mind of god when when god showed him the plan of redemption he showed them the plan of redemption before they needed a plan of redemption and they were rejoicing and shouting over the plan of redemption before there was a need for a plan of redemption listen friends we're now in the redemption amen redemption has come full circle and if we could sing and shout there we can sing and shout here because this is the fullness of redemption that's coming to mankind in the end time we already we already saw the plan he already showed it to the sons of god we are already saying we already shouted for joy when he showed us the plan of redemption and now at the opening of the seals he has showed us once again the plan of redemption where are we we are back in the mind of god amen don't listen we we have entered back into the mind of god by the opening of the seals by a prophetic ministry taking us back to the mystery that was in the back part of god's mind you know you have to remember brother branham is using terminology does god have a back part of his mind does he have a front part and a back part what brother banh is showing us is under uh before everything preceding everything amen there was a mystery that had stayed hidden to even in heaven heaven his brother better said this book was sealed even in heaven the angels didn't know anything about it the cerebellums the cherubims the the heavenly host they didn't know anything about this book this book was sealed even in heaven it was in the back part of god's mind this mystery was hid away away from lucifer away from angelic beings away from humanity it was sealed away in the mind of god but at the opening of the seals he brought what was in the back part of god's mind that god had expressed in symbol form and spelled it out in types they meant through the bible now at the breaking of the seals brother branham goes back and he takes the types and he takes the symbols and he takes the story and the fall of the garden of eden and the creation of man and ruth and and all of these types in the bible of joseph and his gentile bride and revealing himself to brother he goes all the way back and shows us this mystery was in the back part of god's mind that god kept it in the back part of his mind and he showed it in type in the bible but kept the mystery in the back part of his mind so it was sealed where was it sealed in the back part of his mind then when he comes to the opening of the seals in revelation in the time of john he takes john and a vision to heaven and he shows him amen the breaking of the seals but he shows him the breaking of the seals in symbol form because the mystery itself was still sealed in the back part of his mind but in the end time god takes a profit amen and through that prophetic ministry the lamb comes himself and breaks the seals and through that prophet reveals the seals to us and what does he do when he breaks the seals he takes us back to the back part of god's mind where this mystery's been hiding all along what is that back part of god's mind that's where i originated this ministry this message has taken me back home back to my origin back to my beginning back to where i was amen that's why when he tore the seals off the mystery of god he took the seal off of your life continue on in christ is the mystery of god revealing now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly then you see i believe on what's been what what it has been doing what what has been being done i'm sorry what is being done god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said not even the son himself don't know when it's when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't know he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ god hasn't shown this mystery but he showed the mystery it's revealed in every type hmm the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible you catch that the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in time in expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it in god's help well you'll see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it so the bible is showing one goal one purpose one great mystery it was one great mystery in the back part of god's mind but one thing he wanted to achieve and the entire bible has been expressing this one thing he wanted to achieve amen and what was the thing he wanted to achieve he wanted to be expressed amen let's go to revelation 10 now verse 8. we read 10 7 now 3 10 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went to the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he saith unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen this little book that john is eating was the sealed book in revelation chapter five that's what brother brahm tells us in the sealed book in revelation chapter 5 nobody could touch it nobody could read it and nobody could even look at it why it was in the back part of god's mind nobody could touch it nobody could look upon it no man was worthy amen but the lamb was found worthy so he went and took the book and he opened the seals thereof amen and he come down the mighty angel come down with an open book in his hand and now the book that no man could touch no man could read no man could look at now a voice from heaven says go to the angel and take the book and eat it now he's going to take the same book amen that adam had remember some sunday adam had this book it was the title deed to all creation it was the right to rule creation adam forfeited the book brother bam said it went back into the hands of god to keep it out of the hands of lucifer out of the hands of the devil and it's been in god's hand amen but now in the end time that book is now going to come down in the hand of the mighty angel and that book that's been sealed for all this time is now an open book and when it's an open book now john who's the type of the bride he can go and take and eat the book that nobody could touch look at or read now john's commissioned to eat the book when he eats the book he becomes one with it amen the revelations part of the revelation the revelation becomes part of him and it's sweet in his mouth when he's becoming one with it when he's taking it in it's sweet when he has to digest it and live it it becomes bitter because all the rejection of christ comes upon you because it's the rejection of the word but knitting must prophesy again so out of them must come the word that he's eaten now john can eat the book the question is when john ate the book is there any left over for me to eat have you eaten the book he was john was told to eat it up to eat all of it john ate all of it but somehow there's still all of it for me to eat there's still all of it for you to eat this is a book unlike any other book we've ever seen amen this is the mystery that was in god's mind this is the revelation of the one purpose the one goal the one desire that god had amen has been sealed in this book in this book amen it's not just reams and reams and reams of paper amen it's the mystery that has now come down at the time of the opening of the seals and now has been made available to man what man couldn't have what man couldn't know now he's supposed to take it in by revelation and become one with it and now the revelation is in that man and now amen i can eat all of the book but yet you can eat all the book amen i'm feeding on christ are you feeding on christ so if i feed on christ is there lust of christ for you to feed on if i eat a whole bunch is there less for you to have or is there same amount of christ available to you as available to me so we all can eat christ and there's still all of christ left to be eaten amen christ proves this at the breaking of the bread and the fishes amen it never runs out never runs out never runs out amen you cannot out eat amen this manna that came down from heaven amen i i can eat all that god has allotted for me i can eat all of christ but there's still all of christ for you to eat amen remember these are symbols amen trying to get us to a deeper understanding so now where is the book where is the book it depends on where you are in the story for john the book was now in john but there come a time for me that the book was sealed i hope you forgive me for saying that but for me from my perspective there was a time in my life even though the seals were open in 1963 there was a time in my life the book was sealed for me and there was a time in my life when i saw the lamb come forth and take the book and come down with the open book in his hand amen and for me the book was open in the hand of christ and then i went to christ to get the revelation of that book and he gave the book to me and i ate it up and now for me the book is in me but for you the book might be sealed for you the book still might be in the hands of christ you may not have yet gone and taken the book and got the revelation for yourself amen for some of us the book's in us for some of us the books in his hand for some of us the book sealed praise be to god that's why different people will react to the message differently depending on where that book is to them and the way they look at the quotes and the way they see the scriptures and the way they live their life will be dependent on where that book is to them and their perspectives see when you talk about spiritual things they don't operate by the same laws as natural things so sometimes you can see where somebody is in the journey of the book by just the revelation and conduct and attitude of their life attitude towards the message revelation of the message you can begin to see where that book is to them and that's why i choose not to argue with people because when they say the seven steel is not open that's fine i mean because for you it's not open so why would i argue with you and say it's open for you it's not open but for me it's open so there's no reason to argue because the seventh seal can be sealed and open at the same time for you it's sealed for me it's open i hope that makes sense i hope you don't think that i've gone off on the deep end amen but but the way we talk about the message the quotes we gravitate to the things we tend to repeat and the statements we make will show where we are in the journey of the book and where we are in relation to the journey of the book so when somebody says that that the seals aren't open then there's no reason to argue with somebody who says the seals aren't open because for them the seals aren't open but neither is there any reason to argue with me when i say the seals are open because for me the seals are open i've eaten the book you can't you can't take it out of me it's become one with me i've already eaten it i already had the sensation of sweeten my mouth and i already knows what it means to be bitter in my belly so you cannot take that book away from me i've eaten the book amen and me and the book have become one i already have the same experience as spoken of in the scriptures and what brother branham tells us so you can't tell me the seals aren't open but neither can i tell you that the seals are open we all have to go to the message and find out where we are we got to look into the word and find out where we are amen we're beyond the time of trying to persuade people to see things and we're beyond the time of trying to convince people and we're also beyond the time of trying to feel con convinced ourselves when we can convince somebody else amen this is an individual revelation to one person not a church not a group of people but to the individual that's what brother branham is teaching us after the opening of the seals this is no longer church this is bride this is to one this message came to one it came to you and now i'm not going to get my security from you agreeing with me [Applause] that's where the denominations were and they all fell they all agreed and they all went off the word agreeing that they were right so my security cannot come from you agreeing with me because then we take back another denominational spirit my security can only come when i know that i've met the mighty angel with the open book and i've taken that book and i began to eat that book and it was sweet in my mouth and it was bitter in my belly amen but now there's something in me like a spring of living water flowing out to eternal life that that revelation of the book is coming out of my mouth amen placing me amen in revelation chapter 10 verse 11. you can't put me back in five because i'm in 11. i'm in revelation 10 11. you can't take me back to 5-1 now if you're in 5-1 i say keep walking brother there's good roads ahead amen you're on the right path you're on the right trail you're in the book of revelation you're moving down through if you've just come to the message or god's never opened this to you and you're looking at revelations 5 1 and saying we need a lamb to come and take the book i say you're on the right path keep moving down because as you move through that book of revelation in the message of the hour you're going to find that there's a lamb that's come forth to take the book and loose the seven seals thereof keep walking brother don't take my word for it get in the word and keep walking amen because this has to be a revelation to the individual this book has to be in you amen this book that was in the back part of god's mind that was sealed in heaven has to be unsealed in you praise god brother bam said in christ is a mystery god revealed notice next secondly the manifested christ in you the hope of glory the great manifested god in christ now christ manifested in you we'll hurry look what was once god's great secret great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of christ oh do you understand what he's saying what was the mysterious secret when he was elohim all alone with his thoughts amen there was a plan there was a thought there was a desire to be expressed that was the that was the that was the thought of god then as he began to express there was a mystery in all the expression because all of the expression was reflecting back to a thought that he had in his mind an achievement that he wanted to achieve a purpose in doing everything that he did that he wanted to be expressed and everything was reflecting back to that but everything came with a mystery everything came with a seal upon it but now what was once a mystery secret in the back part of god's mind is now in the body of his believers amen it's now is now put into the heart of the believer that is the body of christ so where is the mystery secret now it's in christ where is christ christ is a mini-member bride upon the earth where is the mystery secret inside those who went to the mighty angel and ate the book now the mystery that was sealed in the back part of god's mind is now in the believer amen [Music] what was god's once great secret in his mind before the foundational world is now made manifest think of that i'm sure we don't get it i can't see it the way i ought to i'm sure you don't but god's great mystery what the eternal god had as a mystery has now been unfolded in jesus christ then given right down to his church what was once in god's mind is now in the body of christ jesus making love to the church his bride whispering secrets to her oh praise god if you've never had him whisper the love secrets to you then you don't know how wonderful this is amen when god begins to give you revelation upon revelation of the mystery that he had before the foundation of the world when the seals come off and you begin to see that purpose god had and the bible expressing the entire mystery amen if you've never had him whisper the revelation revelatory love secrets to your year you don't know how wonderful it is because once he's whispered the love secrets to you the most wonderful thing that you ever experience in your life is revelation on the word and when god opens the word to you it does something for you like nothing else can when god begins to unveil himself it'll unveil himself in this scripture and to unveil himself in this story he unveiled himself in this book of the bible and as he begins to peel the layer back and begins to unveil himself to you and show you the mystery secret laying in ruth laying an esther laying in deborah amen all of a sudden you say oh god i love you i love you so much because your plan is so perfect whispering secrets to her then further down in christ mr god revealed he says identified oh the devil is howling about this what's the devil howling about the manifested truth of the promise of the word and her alone this is what the devil's howling about no other church system no denomination no other form of teaching the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone the bride has it and only the bride has it and the devil's howling about that i say let him howl because this revelation and i are eternally united we were bound i was bound with this revelation in god before the foundation of the world and i am bound to it here in this expression by revelation brother brahma says in the breach he said he said there's someone paid that price that i couldn't pay that's right he did it for me charlie he did it for you he did it for the whole human race and now he comes forth to claim his redemptive rights claim it for who not for himself for us he's one of us he's our kin folks i want you to understand what brother branham's saying he's not saying when jesus christ stepped forward and claimed the book of redemption the title deed the book of redemption the heritage of all creation when he comes and takes that he's saying who did he take it for for himself brother bam saying that not that he doesn't get the title deed the right to rule in the millennium that's not it he says not for himself alone but he redeemed it for us who's us who's all included in us he's one of us he's our kinfolk so when he claimed it for us he claimed it for bride and groom together because they are joint heirs with him in his inheritance so let's go back to romans chapter 4. i want to read a couple of the scriptures we've been reading but i want to read it in this light because now he comes to claim the book of redemption the title deed and then he come to claim it not for himself but for us he's one of us so he's included in us he's kin folks with us that's why we'll rule and reign with him for a thousand years as joint heirs for chapter 4 13 for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to abraham or to his steed through the law but through the righteousness of faith so the promise to abraham is that he will be heir of the world do you see that in that scripture he should be heir of the world was not to abraham to his seed through the law so now it's not coming through a jewish heritage or a keeping of the law or the commandments but through the righteousness of faith now let's turn to galatians chapter 3. galatians chapter 3 verse 16. now to abraham and his seed where the promises made one of those is that he'll be heir of the world is that right now to abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not in the seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so christ is that seed who will be heir of the world verse 29 and if you be christ then you're abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so when jesus christ goes as the lamb and claims back the book of redemption he claimed it for us who's us he's one of us he took it for him and his bride because he and his bride have become one amen so he took it for us that's why when a when a man gets married and he buys a home he buys a home for us he doesn't buy a home for him he buys a home for us he said this is our house when jesus christ claimed the book of redemption he claimed it for us he's one of us all right let's go to hebrews chapter 2. we've been reading these scriptures but i want to refresh them in our minds and read them in this context and then keep moving i am so running out of time friends there are so much in my heart that i want to share but language and time and human ability has all ruined everything amen but just bear with me and keep pulling but there's so much on my heart hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things to bring many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren he's one of us we're one with him he that sanctifieth and he that sanctified are all of one brother brennan says in satan's eden and so god knew that he would be here but then he put he put us on in flesh so we could be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he became jesus christ the son of god himself the fullness of the manifestation of god therefore that was god's purpose to display his attributes and fellowship when i was in my father i knew nothing about it but when i became a son and was born of him i was an attribute a part of my father and you were part of your father and as children of god we are part of god's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we could have fellowship one with other as a family of god upon the earth and that was god's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what god wanted at the beginning let's go to romans chapter 8. don't forget this scripture that we just read that he is sanctifieth and he that sanctified her all of one we're going to come back to that but let's jump over to romans 8 now romans chapter 8 verse 29 for when he for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us when was god for us amen before there was a molecule or a speck of stardust when we were in the thoughts of god he predestinated us by foreknowledge he knew we would be here and what purpose we would play and what role we would play and before there was one speck of stardust he was already for us and we were already glorified in that thought so if god before us who can be against us in the message who is this melchizedek he says being eternal with him at the beginning were you eternal with him at the beginning amen the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose catch that the one that left home are you one that left home and come to the earth to do what to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified state it's matured and brought back again amen my word that i send out will not return to me void but it'll accomplish that thing which i determined amen okay genesis 22 i'm going to take 15 more minutes genesis 22 and verse 6 because i've been working all of this to get to this thought genesis 22 and 6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac as son and took the fire took the fire in his hand and the knife and they went both of them together and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together so brother branham has a unique way of of expressing this and possessing the gate of the enemy after the trial from 64. he says did you ever think where did that ram come from remember the country is full of lions and wolves and jackals and the sheep devouring beasts and far back from civilization was he and then up on top of a mountain where there's no water and had picked up the stones all around to make the altar where did that ram come from but it wasn't a vision he killed the ram it had blood what did he say god is able to provide for himself a sacrifice how are you going to come out of the chair how is the child going to get well are you from that chair are you from that heart trouble whatever is the matter god is able to provide for himself so i want to i want to to draw this drawing that we've been dealing with for so long here okay all right we've been drawing this drawing old and new testament talking about coming from adam all the way down through we have abraham we have joseph we have daniel we have all of these that are moving down this line we've got peter we've got paul we've got the seven church ages all right so moving down this line we know that that god in his thinking in the mind of god god already saw all of this is that right so the god's word now is an expression of his thought so this becomes the word line if i could say it that way or an expression of the thought of god in word then the word would taken manifestation and the manifestation would be the anointed word expressed in that day would become christ so that line in each period of time is christ for that day amen and we know that the word come down to accomplish a purpose but the word will return but the word will not return unto god void but it will accomplish the purpose that was set for so if we come down here to daniel when daniel is a young child amen and and jerusalem is now going to become captive to babylon he's taken as a young child over to babylon now for some that would be a disaster but for god there's no disaster because god already has a plan and nothing he said he called nebuchadnezzar his servant amen his servant that came in and executed judgment in the wrath of god his servant now that would take daniel back to a foreign land amen to become a student and become a wise man a counselor in his courts now daniel has to express something for god so the captivity he never died in the war he never died in the captivity amen in fact when he come to to a place where he had to face the word when they were going to give him a diet that was contrary to the dietary law that moses gave him he speaks to a man and says hey the man who was in charge of the children he says hey i can't eat this let us eat pulse only or vegetables only and the man says no the king's wrath he talks to him and who gives favor in the eyes of that man to these hebrew children it was god how did daniel pull that off it was god giving favor to that man it was god giving himself favor because daniel was one of these thoughts that had come down and daniel was an expression of a thought of god was the word of god made manifest daniel was christ for his day or christ was manifesting through the vessel of daniel in that day and so when god when god moved the keeper of the children to have favor amen god was moving the keeper of the children not to have favor on daniel but god was moving to keeper the children to have favor on god god was providing for himself now when when the when the when the corrupt wise men and counselors come up with a law amen to trap daniel amen that nobody can worship anybody but king darius for these what by whatever period of time that was amen they trap him in this trap and they're going to send him to the lions then and darius can't he can't redo the law the law is sealed he's got to go to the lion's den but yet daniel's not afraid because daniel has a revelation that he's in god's hand so when daniel goes down to the lion's den daniel does not stop the mouth of the lions god sends his angel and stops the mouth of the lions now listen to me very closely god did not stop the mouth of the lions for daniel so god stopped the mouth of the lions for god because god had something to express through daniel daniel's life within daniel's life contained amen something god had to express because daniel's life becomes part of our bible it's the word and the word is god and the word being expressed for daniel god has to preserve daniel because god's not preserving daniel god's preserving himself so god listen god is in the lion's den so god comes into the lion's den to protect god god will provide for himself when you come to abraham abraham was given the word of the lord the word of the lord said in isaac shall thy seed be called after god gave that word that's the eternal word of god amen so now god is going to keep his word but he tells abraham to go up and slay a son so abraham's so convinced by this part of his journey that god will keep his word that he goes forward believing that god's able to raise him up but as he's going along his son asking father we got the wood we got the fire we got all this where's the where's the lamb for a sacrifice he said god shall provide for himself a lamb because he knew god had to god had to do something because this word can't fail so god amen he had to preserve the life of isaac because of the word that was in isaac and that word had to be expressed through isaac because he already said and isaac shall thy seed be called so he's not protecting isaac he's protecting himself brother chad listen daniel in the lion's den saved but at some point in his journey he died at some point his journey his earthly life was going to expire he didn't die we no saints sleep but as somewhere in his earthly journey he was going to finish the purpose had for god had for that purpose that for that portion of the word and when that portion of the word's expression was complete daniel goes home until daniel finishes expressing that portion of the word god protects him in the in the war he protects him in the siege of jerusalem he protects him when he's taken captive he protects him when he's when he's uh being trained up as a wise man he gives him favor in the eyes of those who are watching over him he gives him favor in the eyes of each king that comes along now when they throw him into lines then he comes down and shuts the mouths of the lions then what was god doing god was protecting his word god was preserving himself god must provide for himself a sacrifice because i god couldn't take his word back and he couldn't let his word fail so in order for god to keep his word he had to provide for himself a lamb for the burnt offering so that his word wouldn't fail and if you're part of god's word when he was elohim all alone and he had this plan and you're serving a portion of that plan i'm telling you nothing will ever take your life until that expression of the word is finished [Applause] amen but it didn't mean amen life was always easy for abraham or life was always easy for daniel it didn't mean there was no struggle captivity wasn't easy being taken from your home wasn't was difficult i'm sure he wept over the loss of mother and father so it's like i said before it's not like god raised him in a bubble god had an expression he was going to express and part of that expression would tear the height off of daniel and part of that expression would protect him supernaturally but it was all about god expressing his word not really about daniel but it was about what was in daniel amen brother bram said god has provided a way he said but when moses threw his rod down these fellows standing there was super sensory perception threw their rods down done the same thing moses done only moses was following the line of god and what happened there's nothing the man could do he fulfilled his duty when you've done everything that you can do in the line of duty then it's god's business to provide a way god will provide for himself a sacrifice this is how brother branham uses this and moses threw his rod down and aaron threw his down and they turned into serpents and there come the supersensory perceptionist and throw down their rods and they turn and when moses could do nothing else then god provided a way their rods eat up the others what happened to the rods did the snake get bigger or what happened oh god still has a provided way and he's able to make a way when there is no other way he is the way. so when you catch the revelation listen when we when we start talking about back in the mind of elohim back in the attributes and thoughts of elohim the the mystery that had been sealed in god from before the foundation of the world this isn't to have a doctrine that's neat a concept that's interesting it is to actually bring a security that nothing else will bring in your life because if that's your revelation then it doesn't matter if it's lion's den it doesn't matter if it if they throw you in oil to burn you in oil which they tried to do the john the revelator they tried to burn him in a vat of oil and they could not burn him alive somehow no matter how much logs they put on the fire the fire could never get hot enough to boil him because god wasn't yet done with him so they would have to take him out of the oil and eventually they would ship him off amen to patmos island where he would receive the vision and the revelation and write the book of revelation and after he wrote the book of revelation then god would allow him to die john couldn't be burned with oil peter could be hung upside down why would god protect one and not the other it has everything to do with god's purpose the purpose of his word now okay let's keep going god's word would come down and begin to express through generations but that word that would start in adam would now fall in adam and come in a fallen condition now these attributes of the express are going to be expressed in a fallen state and fallen flesh and those attributes that were going to be in a fallen flesh they were going to be separated from god so those attributes in fallen flesh amen now separated from god god could not let himself be separated from himself eternally so let's go back to genesis 22. and let's read this scripture again verse 8 and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb when god was coming down through this line coming through adam coming through abraham coming through moses coming through noah coming through daniel coming through david coming through solomon coming coming coming he was coming but that attribute amen could not return back to him because of the fallen condition so god would become the sacrifice so god would provide himself a sacrifice meaning god would become the sacrifice god would provide himself a sacrifice amen then when jesus was born he was elohim god with us the created body of god the lamb the sacrificial lamb the son of god and god became god provided himself a sacrifice but who was he providing himself a sacrifice for he was providing himself a sacrifice for himself because this is himself and this is himself and he couldn't let his attributes his words stay in a separated fallen situation so he would provide himself a sacrifice for himself oh praise god amen this is the lamb's book of life amen the lamb amen slain before the foundation of the world because god had to display himself he wanted to express himself so in order to express himself he had to allow sin to erupt in heaven he had to allow it to spill down to earth so that he could come as redeemer healer amen deliver all these other things but he was not going to entrust this to other beings amen he had such an expression it had to be himself expressed in each age so it was portion of himself a portion of himself and a portion of himself but god cannot lose himself so in god's great plan he already provided himself a sacrifice he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world brother bam said in the smyrnan church aid that is what happened for our redemption the holy ghost came upon mary and she bore a son and called him jesus the great creator came down and became a sacrifice for our sin his blood was the blood of god brother bram goes on to say god is his own interpreter and now remember you christians were in his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifested manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in christ in god in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is god himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth and that's what god is the whole thing that's what god is the whole thing that's what god is the whole thing what is it god materializing himself tangible so that he could be touched and felt in the message i know i'm sorry in questions and answers in 64 he says and then god became material in a man called jesus christ which was his son this son gave his life that he might bring other sons that god might become tangible working in all in all and the message i know he says satan could not take them he could not drown no in the flood until the purpose of god had been finished he could not burn up the hebrew children until the purpose of god had been finished listen on the timeline here with daniel amen we can come down here and we can drop the three men right and the fiery furnace god will come down himself himself god will be amen as the son of god the fourth man in the fire to shield them from the flames to protect them but all three of them men would eventually die but they wouldn't die until after they finished the portion of the word that was allotted for them to express he said he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of god had been finished neither could the lions eat daniel until god's purpose had been finished neither could death and old age take abraham until the purpose of god had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of god of our life is finished so we gather from there consolation praise god romans 8 28 we know it by heart and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose we come down here to this line right we have you and me before the foundation of the world before there was a speck of stardust god had something for you to do and he had something for me to do in in order to make sure it happened he allocated a portion of himself to come into this dispensation and to this vessel and for that portion of himself to express it's secure because it's him now we call ourselves believers but who is the believer the believer is him in us the seed gene of god that's the believer the believer is not my intellect the believers not my emotions my reasoning believers not my outer man amen the real believer amen is the seed of god inside so he is believing himself but because he would portion this out this portion of himself this attribute this thought this piece of the word this portion of god he would attribute it out for this dispensation to displayed in this fallen vessel in this period of time to express a certain portion of himself because he attributed that out amen he would now give this portion of himself an expression and that expression he would call son and he would allow to have an identity and that identity becomes me but the me is really him the true me is really a portion of him and now it's he believing himself so now when god comes and god brings a deliverance to us god is delivering himself now listen when david was anointed to be king over israel amen god sent solomon down amen solomon comes with the word of the lord to pour the anointing all over david david is now the anointed king is that true david is the anointed king of israel there's now an anointing on his life he's going to become king of israel and all that god had already predetermined for him to do he will do now the lion can't kill him the bear can't kill him goliath can't kill him saul can't kill him he's under a supernatural protection not because he has pretty blue eyes not because he's ready not because he's nice not because he sings well but because there's a portion of god in him that has to have a certain expression and until that expression is finished there is a seal of protection around him that will ensure that that is completed so david becomes invincible under the anointing because of what god thought before the foundation of the world makes him invincible amen now listen this same daniel who was invincible to the lion and to the bear and to goliath and to saul this same man is the one who's running for his life from cave to cave hiding from saul and weeping and crying and making up songs about how horrible his life is is that true you ever read the psalms see david doesn't even understand the old mystery in his life he he knows his enemies are out to get him they would kill him if they had the chance his life is in jeopardy but his life is not in jeopardy but to him his life is in jeopardy but to god his life is not in jeopardy to him he's being chased and it's horrible amen and my life is rough to god it's not rough it's perfect and see david is being saved and he's being saved and he's being saved but in the midst of god supernaturally delivering him from goliath and from the lion and from the bear amen he's not delivering him from saul chasing him from cave to cave in his weeping and his crying and his songs because those psalms will be varied the very psalms amen that show christ suffering and christ's rejection so he's manifesting the word and manifesting the word amen and some i don't know that david knew which part was a manifestation of the word and which part was it but he was under god was providing for himself when he was protecting daniel when god took that rock out of that sling and he guided it like a laser-guided missile and smacked goliath right between the eyes god was protecting god when david amen took that lion by the beard i don't know if you've ever seen the lion face to face i have once we were in mahala holla with brian jones down in south africa brother getting retrieved took me there and there was a fence there that had a big male african lion i was on this side of the fence the lion was on that side of the fence and if there hadn't been a fence there i would have passed out and died the mane on that line was like this big the top of his mane was right here he's got a muzzle like this right in your face he could bite your whole head in his mouth when you see him in pictures you know they're walking around the safari walking around and they look like yeah that's a big cat but when you're looking at it it's eyeballs are that big staring at you teeth are that long it's humongous david took one of those by the beard and smote it and killed it did david grab it by the beard or did god grab it by the beard have you ever seen a bear i've never been that close to one did david kill the bear or did god kill the bear see we've got to go back to the mystery that was in the back part of god's mind and find ourself there if we can find ourselves there then what do i have to be afraid of if i was there if that that sea gene of god that's in me now was there then this is god here and another form and another vessel expressing himself and god will provide for himself if you have a need for your life to be sustained if you have a need for protection for god to keep expressing his word god will protect you for the expression of his thought but if we have need of humiliation for him to express his word we'll be humbled if we need to be afflicted so that we can express the portion of the word we'll be afflicted it's all about expressing the word amen this is why we get so confused in our christian journey sometimes but if we could go back to david david was victorious the day he threw the rock and killed goliath he was weeping in a cave shortly after that amen mourning over the the direction of his life and worried about whether his enemies were going to slay him or not and he was still manifesting god he was still under the care of god he was still the word expressing in that day in the cave and on the battlefield but we getting expressing in our lives like like david god will do something absolutely supernatural and deliver us from sickness work circumstances out for our job do so do things that we couldn't do work them out supernaturally and then the next week we find ourselves with a bad head cold and we're wondering whether we're a child of god or not or have any faith we're in the cave strumming strumming the the harp saying oh what was me if god would only have show me his favor if god would still see me and he proved he saw you the week before he proved he knew where you were he proved he heard the conversation in your car right before you came to church he proved that he knew the need that you had and provided before you asked amen and now when you find yourself in a difficult situation maybe there's another part of the word that has to be expressed amen but we begin to strum on the heart and say oh if god would just look down on me if god just knew my sorrow if god i say god take me back to before the foundation of the world to the mystery that was locked inside of you that you've opened in this day that i know the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord i know that you're with us and i know you're expressing yourself god just helped me to surrender more and give you first place and surrender to you in everything in my life this is why you know we can be we can preach in such a way that if you ever struggle to have a problem you're not a believer we can preach in such a way that the bride has got overcoming power she's got the word which is all true it's true but what is overcoming power for what is the word for it's for god to express himself we can preach a way in such a way that we begin to believe every trial causes us to doubt our sonship but i don't want to do that i want to eat the book and become one with the book and realize that god could protect a governor could deliver him from a mob and the next city he could be stoned and left for dead but he'd raise him up then he would get shipwrecked but god would deliver him on the shipwreck island he'd be bitten by a snake but he'd shake it off but just a short time after that he'd be beheaded for the gospel sake when was god with him and when wasn't god with him i say god give us revelation give us security give us an understanding of who we are in you and what it is you're trying to accomplish in the day and let us have faith that no matter what the circumstances it'll never hinder your word every sickness you'll overcome it amen every trial you'll defeat it how you'll do it is up to you i'm just here to express whatever you want expressed in this day i want you to have preeminence over me i'm not going to question you i'm not going to question what you do i'm not going to question who i am but i'm going to watch for you to do something wonderful in every circumstance i'm going to watch for you to deliver i'm going to watch for you to manifest i'm going to watch for you to heal i'm going to watch for you to speak when i get in a situation amen and and i get into a trouble i get into a problem you put me in contact with people that i've never been in contact before i'm watching for you to say something to open a door to speak something just i'm always watching for you amen to manifest yourself in my life because nothing is without a purpose amen but i want to have that revelation of the mystery that was in the back back part of god's mind i want to eat the book and become one with the book until all of a sudden life begins to make sense that i'm not a christian here and not a christian here i'm not a good believer here and a bad believer here but i'm just a child of god here to express something of god's life in this earth and god will express it in highs and lows and good and then bad but i'm here to express something and nothing nothing will stop that expression amen let's all stand musicians if you could come i want to read one last scripture out of isaiah 14. while the musicians are coming isaiah chapter 14 verse 24. thank you for being patient with me you get a break from me for a few services isaiah 14 sorry isaiah 14 24 the lord of hosts has sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand can you say amen nothing will change that we need to move forward as believers and believe and in every circumstance we come ourselves we come into let us just take the same confession abraham had god will provide himself a sacrifice how will you get over this god will provide for himself how will you figure that out god will provide for himself how will you overcome this god will provide for himself i don't know how i don't know where abraham didn't know there was going to be a ram in the thicket when he said that but he knew god would provide for the word and every situation we find ourselves in in every trial and everything that goes on amen i wish i wish that i could always have that as my first response but i'm praying that god will will help me change my ways to where no matter what happens i can say god will provide for himself i'm not here because i chose to come here amen and the conscience i have now and the thing i am now i'm not here i'm here by god's thought i'm geared by god's purpose i was placed in this body by god's choice i was placed in this time by god's choice i was placed in this geography by god's choice and i'm here to serve his purpose and god will provide for himself i believe that friends i want to believe it more man let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word we ask god that you would manifest it in us more and more day by day oh god if we could just get out of our own way lord if we could just have the right confession and god help us to stop thinking carnally help us to stop thinking earthly but god i pray that you keep lifting us to that back part of your mind and refreshing our memory lord that you would break the spiritual amnesia and we would realize what we realized when we shouted for joy when we saw the plan of redemption back there and we shouted for joy god would you break our amnesia so that we can have that same joy in the midst of our circumstances now oh god forgive us for our negative speech lord forgive us for our attitudes lord help us to walk a walk of faith perfect faith like abraham had when he didn't know the solution he didn't know the way out but he knew your word he didn't know how you would provide but he knew you would provide he knew you wouldn't let that word fail god we're in situations we don't know how you'll provide but you promised that by your stripes we are healed we don't know how we'll get out of these circumstances we don't know how these troubles will pass we don't know how the healing will come but we know one thing that your word won't fail and you've made a promise and you'll keep that promise god help us to speak words of faith help us to have actions of faith help us to live a life of faith like abraham so that we can say god will provide for himself god we trust you we trust your provision we trust that you're doing what's best help us to express your word in every circumstance in jesus christ's name we pray amen remember the bin he's already [Music] [Music] everything you he's already provided
