TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to read revelations out of revelation 16. amen also wanted to announce that we're going to have a youth meeting this friday night is our regularly scheduled youth meeting but we're gonna have it at brother paul and sister jenny priest's house they're gonna have a bonfire some food and maybe a hay ride and it's open to all the area youth we've invited the other churches and uh brother jonathan martin is actually going to be ministering for us there so that's exciting we're looking forward to that uh so god bless you and also remember the politcarian today after service we'd love for you all to stay and have fellowship those are our favorite times is when we can spend all day together amen god bless you let's read this together starting in verse 12 we're going to read about the sixth vial in chapter 16 verse 12. and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great day of god almighty men see we have three unclean spirits like frogs and we know this is a trinity doctrine and we know that when when the false false religion began through the tower of babel through nimrod and all of that it went very quickly to a three god system amen most of the false religion has a mult multiple gods and it moved into the christian church when pagan rome adapted to christianity and blended the two the false religion with the true religion and so we see what a filthy thing this is and what a terrible thing it is it's not just a difference of opinion about the godhead it's not just a different way of thinking it's not like everything's okay we think this way you think this way but we all love god these are three unclean spirits like frogs amen and they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle that great day of god almighty why is the trinity doctrine become such a separation point why is it people will go along with you on so many things and you can be christians and you can have fellowship for so long but as soon as you touch the trinity doctrine you're cut off because it's the thing that is gathering the whole world to the battle of the great day of god almighty verse 15 behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you for this day and for this opportunity we have to hear your word preach lord and i just pray that you would take the vessel that you would move it to the side that i could just relax lord and you would come in and feed your sheep like you so faithfully do you've promised to do it lord and we're just expecting now to hear from you i pray that you break your word to us lord that we might feed upon the fresh manna from heaven in jesus christ's name we pray amen you all can be seated praise the lord we've got i've got a lot on my on my heart today and this is i think if i'm not wrong this is the seventh message on the fourth seal and when we started you know we started going down the line and i thought you know we're going to crank through these and and but you know we read that quote several times when brother branham said you could stop on each one of these seals and preach a whole month of sermons each night on just one of them he said they go all the way through the scripture all the way back from the back all the way through the scriptures each of these seals does and we're beginning to see that that's true i mean not just something that brother branham said this is becoming more and more of a reality to us as god breaks the word to us praise the lord i have been i just want you to know i've been an absolute basket case the last two days three days because the subject is so huge and i thought we're on the seventh part of the fourth seal we'll just wrap it up we'll be done and all sudden it expands and expands you know brother branham said at the end time when at the end of time it's like a roman candle going off it just pops and off of that more pop out and that's the way it is here brothers and sisters it just more comes out and more comes out and more comes out and so i want to talk about armageddon if we could bring up the powerpoint i want to talk about armageddon this morning but i want you to i want to put put on your spiritual jackets this morning and let's really see what the prophet is saying if you'll remember about two months ago brother nestor come along just before camp and he preached on spiritual armageddon how many remembers that well he had got to my subject way before i was ready to get to it but it was exciting because we had just finished on the third seal starting on the fourth seal and brother branham talks about this uh quite a bit in the fourth seal and we're going to look at that because the fourth seal is the wrap-up of everything for the gentile bride it's the wrap-up and finishing of everything for the gentile church and so he speaks about this but i just wanted to take my time getting into it and i've been studying this for a long time so it's a really really big subject we're going to get into a few things that i that i hope will clear some things up for us now do we believe in a physical armageddon where a battle where christ returns with his saints and physically sets up his dominion upon the earth absolutely without a shadow of a doubt we know that it's going to happen but there's also got to be something that takes place spiritually here's a principle that brother lays down our brother branham lays down in the palm worm locust glocus cankerworm and caterpillar you know he preached this subject back in 53 but he picks it up again in the restoration of the bride tree and he touches on it several times through his ministry and he's laying down a pattern or something for us to see here it said during this time of joel's prophecy here the church was in a terrible condition backslid just prior to the coming of the lord the first time and how that the spirit came upon this prophet and he foresaw things and he saw the condition of the jews and he saw the condition of the church in this day now this prophecy of course like other prophecy has a compound meaning a prophecy sometimes has a natural meaning then it has a spiritual meaning so here in joel the fact that brother branham will go back and pick up these four stages of this insect in joel is astonishing because if you read through it and you read through it in the context of what's being written that it's clearly talking about a condition that was happening right then to the jews right he's talking about how how this this insects have come in and they've been been destroying the land and taking what's rightfully israel and he's really talking about a time when under the breakup of the of the grecian empire the king of the north would come down and begin to spoil uh the nation of israel and be begin to destroy them and take them down but god was going to do a restoration work and bring everything back and that literally happened right then at that time and brother branham would go back and he would grab that prophecy amen and he could pull it right to today how is it that brother brenham is able to do that because he saw peter do the exact same thing he looked at peter peter on the day of pentecost he went back to the exact same prophecy that had already been fulfilled in the natural and he pulled it right over to the spiritual and brother branham comes now at the end of the gentile dispensation at the end of the of the bride and he comes down and he takes the same prophecy and he brings it right to today hallelujah only prophets can do that friends so we've got to be careful that when we read the scripture we don't read it and say oh that's finished if we don't read it and say oh that applies to that because once god writes his word his word is eternal that's a principle we cannot forget god's word is eternal and you can't read and say oh that was done when the king from syria came down and he destroyed him and then you had the maccabees rise up and cast them a mountain cleansing of the temple and restoration it's over peter didn't think it was over peter thought it was applicable to his day amen and not only that a vindicated prophet comes in our day and he doesn't think it's over he thinks it's applicable to the church ages see how you cannot use intellectual reasoning to look at the word of god you've got to find god's pattern and god's pattern is to bring a prophet on the scene who's a divine interpreter of the word and when he comes on the scene like peter standing there full of the holy ghost he had every right by the authority of the holy ghost to pull that scripture and put it in his day are we right and brother branham had every right to do the same thing so we have to be careful when we read when we read scripture like we read this in in the sixth vial and and talking about what's happening here we have to be careful when we read this we don't say oh that's only in the future that's only going to happen in a physical got to be very very careful so we see brother branham leaves us shows us this principle and it's and it's manifest through the scriptures it's very clearly done paul does the same exact thing jesus does the same exact thing they'll take prophecies they'll take things that have already happened things that have happened to the nation things that had happened to david himself and it actually physically happened to david in david's lifetime but jesus would pick it up and say it was about me but it was about david but david was just foreshadowing something else to come but but jesus not every man could pick that up and say that works here and that works there but jesus was the prophet amen he was the great prophet so he could pick it up and he could apply it right to today hallelujah no doubt some of the jews were there and say you're taking that out of context that was already fulfilled and that was david that wasn't talking about you amen but he had every right to do that hallelujah so we've been following two vines and as we go through here i'd like to take a step back review and go forward again take a step back and go forward because we don't want to lose our place amen it says in the greatest battle ever fought this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what this purpose was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us it has been raging ever since so the battle moved from angels became human battles this is really important to note so the battle continued we have that so the battle that started in heaven it didn't end when when lucifer and his angels were cast out because they continued the battle right on earth this isn't a different battle this is the same battle and it's continuing all the way through and now it moved from angels to humans so now who's fighting in the battle amen if we don't realize what our purpose here on earth your purpose here is as a soldier amen your purpose is not here to to raise your family and and to have a job and to see what kind of goods you can accumulate while you're on this earth all of those things will happen you have to live a natural life that's the way god's designed it but that's not the purpose of life your purpose of life is to come and fight this battle and overcome the devil that's why you're placed on this earth and that's why you're placed in the laodicea is to fight this battle the devil doesn't want you to realize it's a battle that's why he's made laodicea look so much like there's no warfare going on that everything is easy and everything is peaceful and you got a nice home and you got a nice car and you got plenty of clothes and you got food and you can get a job if you want to get a job and everything's going okay because he doesn't want you to realize that you're actually in a battle and when everything's going okay you're actually losing the battle so this whole system is set up to keep spiritual amnesia going so that we don't know who we are and we don't know what we're here for and we're not actually fighting back we're just going with the pied piper right and that's the whole system it's what it's set up for that's why you know work becomes all-consuming part of life and and then we we get all of these things where we have to start running our kids all to all these activities and now the family split up and we're running to this activity and this activity and work is a consuming part of dad's life work is a consuming part of mom's life and we just work on work and work and run and run and run until at the end of the day we collapse in bed and if we're lucky we'll get up in time to go to church on sunday that's satan's eden that's what devil's trying to do because he doesn't want to lose this battle he wants to win and the battle moved from angels to humans we've got that so it's not as if we can wait for somebody else to pick up the battle and fight there is nobody else you're the one who's placed here in this period of time to defeat the devil in this age in satan's eden at the end of laodicea this is where you're at so there's no putting it off on somebody else and if you if if we're missing our obligation and missing our our duty then then the whole thing is still failing the whole the whole battle is still falling into lucifer's hands it fell into his hands in heaven there was a rebellion there was sin then he was cast out then he fell and it fell into again in eden then it fell to the hebrew church then it fell to the gentile church remember it's been falling his way ever so long but there's going to come a time there's going to be a people who wake up out of spiritual amnesia and realize what they're on this earth for and begin to fight back and take back what's been taken from them amen and defeat the devil in his own terms on his own ground hallelujah look what this is all coming to this is in the fourth seal now mother branham is talking about the the ecumenical move and talking about denominationalism and how it starts and how it how it goes all over and divide up on different beliefs he says look what is this all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven it's going it's coming to the end time battle and friends it's coming to the end time battle that's all there is to it amen and as we're coming to an end time battle we have to realize we're not coming oh how do i say this so that we get it we got to get this we're not coming to an end time pleasure life to live easy and smooth and then slip away in a rapture and everything's wonderful we have to first come to the end time battle before we come to the rapture so that we can return back to set up the kingdom hallelujah i just want to say it this way we can look forward to the physical armageddon where christ comes down with his saints and sets up the earthly kingdom restores the the throne of david and the son of david sits on the throne and we rule and reign with him a thousand years that's a wonderful promise to us but it doesn't do us any good to think about that and contemplate on it and miss the battle we're in now because if we don't win this we don't go there we can talk about what's coming and talk about millennial reign and talk about return of the lord with the same talk about defeating the devil when he's incarnate we can talk about all those things but that's all we're doing is talking about it the only way to get there is to win here win here the spiritual war and if we win the spiritual war here we get to go to the physical and set up the kingdom physically in a physical millennium on the earth but when we're cruising along like everything's just as it's always been and there's no battle to fight and nothing going on we're never going to get there amen we have too many times that that the devil just comes in and he deceives so easily keeps us from the right objective and from the real purpose in our lives and we start chasing rainbows and we start chasing butterflies around and we're so distracted and we're missing the real point and the real point is for us to come so that the devil is no longer getting the upper hand on the people of god and the word of god prevails over him and when the word of god prevails over him then we've accomplished our purpose then this battle here is won and then we get to go hallelujah the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to earth then he polluted eden then he's been polluting it ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's come to the battle on earth and it's to be finished on earth at the at the end time in the battle called armageddon now everyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked them out michael and his angels overthrew them just run out and then they did they dropped right down into eden and here started the battle down here praise god you let me go back i don't want you to read that yet whenever i put something up everybody always reads ahead now you see why you see why the seals had to be broke and spiritual amnesia had to be removed and we had to recognize the plan of redemption and who we are and how we fit in and what's been going on all this time we had to because if we stayed in that sleepy condition then we're going to constantly be deceived by the devil and deceived by the devil but we've got to come to an awakening a realization that we came from god that we go to god what the whole plan on earth is all about what our position is where we're at and what we're supposed to be doing to overcome right because because before that we're just cruising along just doing what we think is right what we think is best trying to do the best that we can but the whole time the devil keeps having victory over the word of god because there's always a letdown somewhere on the word of god so there had to come a time when the word of god would be restored to the people and they would be given a faith to believe that word and when they do now the devil was not going to get victory over that word anymore hallelujah so now you can see why why i just don't know how else to say it but just to say it now you know why a social gospel will never win the battle and now you know why if we just got up here and every day talked about you know be nice to your children and love your wives and husbands and wives be really nice to one another and and you know uh uh you know set up your family and and do nice things and then go out and do some community service and show people the love of christ by being really nice to them you know those things are wonderful and there's nothing wrong with those things but they'll never get you to win this battle and then we'll just keep going on like we are talking about being nice to people and everybody loves jesus and jesus loves everybody but you know why the seals had to come because that gospel will never ever ever win the battle it'll never expose the enemy it'll never expose his battle plan it'll never show his tactics that he come in and defeat the church with all we know we don't know anything we're just cruising along trying our best to be nice to our wife and be nice to our children and be nice to our neighbor and that will never produce what we're supposed to produce in this day that's why brother branham will come along and he will tear down everything tear it completely down and build it back according to the word build back the family according to the word build back the role of a father the role of a mother amen build back the structure of a church and the gifts of the body and the administration of the of the of the ministry he built it all back according to the word amen because the word has to be restored in order for satan to be defeated hallelujah you know there's i'm off on a tangent because nothing else but this message will work there are more there are more family christian family counselors and books and and there's bookstores laden i mean racks and racks and racks of christian material trying to get the christian people to act like christians racks of it racks of it how to have a family and guard against divorce in your marriage and and they have the same problem year after year generation after generation it keeps getting more unholy more on moral amen the life of the teenagers are more ungodly than it was the year before amen the marriages are just in much trouble as they ever were and they may publish 15 new books this year in the christian world and they'll have the exact same statistics next year that they had last year because if if you want to have a good marriage first get the holy ghost and the holy ghost is only available in the fullness of the word you've got to receive the person of the word jesus christ revealed to you and with it comes the holy ghost and with that comes the life to live what all those books are talking about and missing a million miles because they start talking about things like you know you've got to have quality time and you've got to you can have all the quality time you want it won't do anything the holy ghost is what does it amen now you take the holy ghost and have quality time and you've got supercharged quality time you've got to beat people to the new birth amen and the birth is in the word you can't be rejecting jesus christ and expecting the life of jesus christ to come when the when the word was restored the full life was restored and receiving that gives you the power to have the family you want the personal victory you want the marriage you want the church you want it's all in the word that's why nothing else will work hallelujah praise god i don't even know what to say next we've got to have this revealed word it does something to us it changes us it breaks away the old way it starts bringing in all kinds of of thoughts we've never had before and we start overcoming things that we've always struggled with and not even knowing exactly how we're overcoming but we're overcome by what by just receiving the word where willpower has failed us for decades all of a sudden god does something supernaturally before we even recognize it and now we're overcoming and how did it happen i don't know how it happened i just kept reading my bible i kept listening to the message i kept coming to church i kept amending to the word and things just kept dropping off of me hallelujah you know that's that's why this social gospel has utterly failed and will completely fail and will never do any good it might help people try really hard to be nice and we want more nice people in the world and if people are not going to have the holy ghost i prefer they read the books and be nice to me but it's not the solution to the problem amen praise god let's go on a little further it's an old battle that started way back beyond time and satan and his angels was kicked out and they come to earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word now do you got it now you got it this would if i ever wrote a book on family on marriage on christian finances on church structure if i ever wrote a book amen i would put this on page one in bold letters and the rest of them would be blank because why does the devil defeat your family because of this why does he defeat you in your personal finances because of this why does he come in and break up the church because of this this is how he wins the battle every time amen he doesn't win it because you forgot to be nice he wanted because you let down somewhere on the word amen and that's why the measure of the word has to be preached and held up here because that's our victory that's how we overcome when we don't let down on the word but we stay with the word then he's defeated but when we let down on the word then he's won the victory over the word remember he's not trying to get the victory over you you're easy for him to defeat you're just flesh you're just in human flesh you're just in a hybrid condition and you're easy to stomp you're easy to beat but what's he trying to get victory over he's trying to get victory over the word of god because god must operate by his own laws and if satan can have victory over the word then satan gets to stay in his position he's a squatter on the earth he's set up as the prince of the power of the air he acts like he's the god of the he is the god of this evil age he acts like he's the god of this earth but he's just a squatter and what gives him right to remain here what gives him the right to remain here is the people of god letting down on the word gives him the right to remain in your life the people of god letting down on the word what gives him a right to stay in your family the people of god letting down on the word amen we bring things into our home that the prophet of god told us not to bring into our home we bring television into our home magazines and all these other things into our home we have trouble in our home and we say how's the devil getting victory because we let down on the word we can't let down on the word and expect to win the battle win the victory and then we struggle with complexes and we struggle with fears we struggle with anxieties and tension and all kinds of problems it's because we let down on the word and when we let down on the word satan who gets victory over the word when one amen one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar i gotta i believe that there's gonna come a time he's not going to get victory over the word that's why god keeps revealing his word that's why our lives keep going higher and higher and higher because why because we're coming to a place where he's not going to have victory over the word of god why because the people of god are going to wake up out of spiritual amnesia and wake up so much to the point where they're not going to give him they're not going to give the white horse any space the red horse rider he's not going to get anything the black horse he's not going to get a thing from me i'm going to stay right here with the pure word of god hallelujah amen so we see the battle plan all the way up and we're focusing right on the end now when brother nestor preached uh spiritual uh armageddon back two months ago he started with this quote and i thought it was fantastic so i'm gonna read this to you out of the first seal said here's the plan of it the first thing happens there is an announcement in the heaven first what happened a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war their plague falls and the church age opens see what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of god not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of god and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war so he's showing the seven church age messengers and how they would each catch something from god and when they would when they would begin to declare that amen that which that would be a trumpet call that would declare a spiritual war praise god so what do you think happens if each age amen each age each mystery revealed amen each trumpet sound declares a spiritual war and you can very clearly see that in in the in the last three church ages you can see what happened when luther began to declare the revelation that the justice saved by faith it started a spiritual war i mean you could see that you can read the histories you can see it and then wesley did the same thing when he come along preaching sanctification it started a spiritual war so much so that when he would preach he would throw stones and rotten fruit at him who was who was throwing the stones and the rotten fruit the church members amen why because he was telling him you can't live holy and drink you can't live holy and run around you can't live holy and do those things and they didn't like what he was saying they didn't care whether it was in the word or not they wanted to stay right where they were they didn't want to change they wanted to be christians part of the anglican church in good standing and they wanted to live as immoral as they wanted to be as drunk as they wanted to and they wanted to stay right there and when wesley come along and said you're in sin you'll die in your sin god calls for a holy sanctified life amen when they did that then they hated him praise the lord that's why anytime a minister starts nailing you on your compromise starts talking about bringing television in your house or spending all your time on the internet or are you into pornography in the movies you shouldn't be into that's why you can't just take and say oh god me now the thing you have to do is dislike the minister has to happen every time because the pattern has to stay true we've got to attack the minister because it can't ever be me amen that's the pattern the pattern never changes wesley wasn't saying anything wrong but what he said they didn't like and they didn't attack his doctrine they didn't go to debate with him on the bible they attacked the man hallelujah some things never change spirits don't die they just migrate to new host bodies every spirit that's been here will always be here hallelujah in the in the first seal brother brennam says now remember in the days of the seventh angel his sounding forth blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is to finish all the mysteries of god so here he's going to seventh angel is going to blast another trumpet and that trumpet's not going to be just what luther said look at the war that broke out when luther brought his revelation look at the war that broke out when wesley brought his revelation now what do you think will happen when it's all seven sounding at once this is going to be a great battle a huge spiritual war and that's the warfare we're in today hallelujah all seven bringing to a great battle not just not just a single church age messenger battle not just a single trumpet battle but seven voices amen seven thunders now bringing to a great battle not a portion of the word creating a stir but the fullness of the word amen if you get the fullness of the word you've got to come to the fullness of the spiritual battle not a partial battle not a church age battle but an end time battle praise god brother rem says in the fourth seal now on this mixed color worldly pale sick horse just think of it you know that's a bad thing now watch where he gathers them from the corners of the earth they are gathered now for the showdown the showdown will be at armageddon according to the word on the pale horse riding on it with a death tact with the nametag death listen antichrist first denomination that that can't be the spirit he's saying the first denomination was the catholic church that can't be the spirit with this jezebel a prostitute to the word with her daughters with her protestants gathering themselves together now in unity now they are joining themselves together now brother branham starts he's talking now about the ecumenical move and i've got some things i want to show you it becomes crystal clear here in a few minutes he's talking about the catholic church wooing the protestants back in the ecumenical move and he says now they're joining themselves together coming to that showdown to armageddon and riding on a mixed colored horse so now the ecumenical move if you understand the ecumenical move all it is is an agreement between churches that we will unify and we will agree together to be brothers and sisters and not fight against each other and then we'll all be considered christians that's the ecumenical move how is the ecumenical move going to bring a worldwide war when they gather against israel to destroy israel you see this it's spiritual and natural hallelujah this ecumenical move is coming to the showdown to armageddon remember the three unclean spirits like frogs that went out what did they do to gather all the kings in all the world to the great day of the battle of almighty god to bring them to armageddon amen gathering his subjects from every nation under heaven did not daniel interpret the dream and seeing that streak of iron running to every kingdom of rome here they come gathering now set still for the close just a minute and listen they're gathering in now to do it bringing his subjects from the four corners of the earth riding a pale sickly three-colored mixed horse same man now listen he's saying he's already gathering all of his subjects together we're not coming to one physical place friends he's already through the ecumenical move gathering together what are they gathering to they're gathering back to this ecumenical system this system of agreement between religions where they break down their doctrinal differences and just agree on the bare minimums tying them back to the catholic church that is gathering to armageddon hallelujah now in revelation 19 not only is he getting ready he's talking about the antichrist is getting ready but christ is getting ready to meet him the battle is going to be hot and heavy hallelujah does that scare you shouldn't scare you the battle is going to be hot and heavy but but i've read the whole book hallelujah we're going to be hot and it's going to be heavy on him amen christ in revelation 19 christ is gathering his not from the four corners of the earth because they're going to be a little remnant what is he doing he's gathering them from the four corners of heaven on a snow white horse he also has a name not death but the word of god life amen god it wrote right on his thigh there the word of god that's the only life because god is the only source of eternal life there is zoe is that right he's he's got death wrote on him christ got life thrown on him those with him are on white horses also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world amen and they are faithful to the word amen let's go back and read while you got your bibles let's turn to revelation chapter 19. because brother branham is referring to revelation 19 over and over and over again and i'd like to read that together we're going to take our time here a little bit we've got quite a few scriptures we want to read revelation 19 and 11. and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war now recognize here that in revelation 19 and revelation 19 he doesn't see the lord on the earth in this white horse he sees heaven open and he sees then he catches the vision of him i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he did judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vester dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords let's turn back to revelation 17. revelation 17 and 14 talking about the judgment of the says these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called chosen and faithful so these armies that follow after him when they make war with him he he is king of kings and they that are with him are called chosen and faithful amen and they are the armies of heaven the chosen and faithful are the armies of heaven when we get here to revelation 19 this is not referring to an angelic host brother branham said these are the saints so the remember the battle moved from angels to humans we got that so the battle moved from angels to humans so the army must be human and the armies followed after him which were the armies which were in heaven followed after him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean brother in the fourth seal he says those with him are on white horses also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world amen they are faithful to the word amen ooh i like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world who's chosen before the foundation world this is predestination now he's going to show us predestination and free moral agency right here in this scripture he said they are chosen before foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing hallelujah who's he talking about you the armies of heaven you the fa the chosen and faithful chosen from before the foundation of the world and faithful by your own choosing hallelujah you're in the armies of heaven but you must be chosen and faithful to be in this army and to fight in this army you have to be chosen before the foundation of the world and you must also be faithful to the word by your own choosing that means you obey the word you lay down your life for the word you come subject to the word by your own choosing that is the armies that follow him to armageddon that is the armies on white horses with white raiment are the ones that are chosen and faithful i'm chosen i'm chosen but are you faithful because if you're not faithful you can't be part of that army you've got to be chosen and faithful praise god help us to be faithful god help us to be faithful he said they're faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him where do you get stimulated with new wine and oil that's the spirit and that's the the stimulation of revelation of the word this is the armies of heaven friends stimulated with new wine and oil praise god oh hallelujah so many places i want to go so many things we want to talk about so little time amen let's just go through the powerpoint now i might back up a little bit and the feast of trump it's note in revelations the ninth chapter in the 13th verse now notice real close under the sixth trumpet revelation 9 13 under the sixth trumpet note there was 200 000 horsemen that had been bound in the river euphrates was turned loose under the sixth trumpet now there's not two hundred thousand horsemen in the world but there was two hundred thousand horsemen notice it i want to jot it down so you can read it they wasn't natural horses they breathed fire and they had breastplates of jasper and they had tails and the end of the tail looked like a serp and a snake's head on the end of it stinging see it was spiritual horses spiritual devils chargers that had been bound in euphrates all these years supernatural devils we got that what was it the old roman empire being revived the persecution of the jews they had been bound for nearly 2 000 years at the river euphrates can't cross to the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side euphrates you know come through eden but they were bound there two hundred thousand devils of persecution if we could if we could look together boy i got one i got further on this quote to go but let's read uh let's read together in revelation no no no sorry revelation 9. this is the one brother bran is referring to the sixth trumpet now you don't have to turn back but i'm going to turn back and just remind you of the sixth vial because you're going to find there's a pattern laid here in in the book of revelation and if we if we try to make every single word that we read and make logical sense to us you'll never understand the book of revelation because here you've got these horses that are coming out these horsemen and breastplates of this and jasper and tails and stings on them and all this and brother brandon said that has nothing to do with something you can see in the physical world that's not that's not like those are tanks and and on the back of tanks they got char no he said these are supernatural devils right so when you read this you have to understand these are supernatural devils that are coming out so in the sixth vial he says he poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water there was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared so you need the sixth vial has to do with drying up euphrates so that the kings of the east can come across so what does the sixth trumpet have to do with verse 13 and 9 13 and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which was before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates so here the sixth trumpet and the sixth file both have to do with euphrates they're linked together friends we'll see what the prophet says about this and the four angels were loose which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and adjacent and brimstone and the heads of horses whereas the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which issued out of their mouths for their powers in their mouth and their tails for their tails were like serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt and the rest of them which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor their fornication nor of their thefts so we're going to we're going to read what brother branham's saying but here he says they're not natural horses he's talking about these horses they're not natural horses he said it's the old roman empire being revived we got that under the sixth trumpet the six the six seals are revelations to the gentiles the six trumpets are revelations to the jews and then the the seals show the redemption of all the elect amen and especially the first four show the redemption of the gentile bride and the gentile church the gentile bride but the the the trumpets show the redemption of the jews the trumpets are to drive them back to the homeland so that they can receive the atonement the true atonement jesus christ when two witnesses come to them but i want you to understand something else if you'll back up with me to verse 8 or chapter 8 chapter 8 and verse 13 revelation 8 and 13. stay with me we're going to go through some details but they're very simple just just because we go through details don't get lost it's very simple when we get to verse 13 we've already read through four trumpets and there's three trumpets left the fifth the sixth and the seventh so verse 13 is in between the fourth and the fifth and he says and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason are the other voices of the trump of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound so here after four trumpets we have an angel come and say whoa whoa whoa brother branham calls us the three woes and he calls it the three world wars and he said the fifth trumpet is world war one the sixth trumpet is world war ii and and and the seventh trumpet is world war three we got that are we together whoa whoa whoa is three world wars war one fifth trumpet world war two sixth trumpet world war three seventh trumpet so that's why brother branham when he sees the sixth trumpet and he sees what happens in the sixth trumpet all these demon powers come out he said it's the old roman empire being revived the persecution of the jews does anybody remember what happened in world war ii were the jews persecuted they had been bound for nearly 2 000 years at the river euphrates can't cross to the promise a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side so here brother ben's talking about the binding of the loosing of the four angels and the river euphrates the sixth trumpet and he's talking about the sixth vial because they can't cross the boundary of euphrates because he's going to get into this clearly in a minute because pagan rome became papal rome and mixed christianity in with paganism so that it could continue on and because of that it can't cross into the promises until this boundary of euphrates is taken away so it's held back it's bound and held back for time for a period of time until certain things are accomplished and then the waters dried up then they're released and then they can begin to do what they're anointed to do right who was it in a.d 70 that destroyed jerusalem and scattered the jews it was rome and here brother brandon said for nearly 2 000 years now amen they've been bound by euphrates and euphrates is the border the natural border that was given to the promised land he was told abraham was told you can have this land from the river in egypt to the great river euphrates it's the boundary line for the king of the north and the kings of the east babylon was on euphrates the medes and the persian were beyond euphrates assyria was beyond euphrates amen and the king of the north comes across euphrates so there's a boundary keeping them out of the promise but there's coming a time the boundary will be removed so that they can come in and brother branham said that's the reviving of the old roman empire hallelujah so many of these things we're not waiting for it to happen we've seen a fulfillment and there will be another fulfillment just like joel's prophecy of the four insects and the restoration back that that happened and it happened again and it happened again the same things we're talking about now have happened in the mild form and they're going to happen again in the tribulation period are we together so just because i say that brother baby says this don't think well that now that's over no it's coming again in the tribulation period so are we together they can't cross and brother bam tells us why can't they cross why can't they cross over he said it's the same nature in the catholic church that was in the roman system he says but because they've mixed with christianity because they have a form of christianity they can't cross on and do what they want to do they have to look like christians that's the boundary that's the euphrates that's holding them back they have to maintain the image of christianity because they would love to do what they've always done stomp out and crush with their teeth and stomp underfoot and become absolute dominant and kill all those that oppose them that's what they want to do but they've been held back out of the boundary because of having to appear christian hallelujah oh the message reveals everything same feast of trumpets notice what happens under the sixth trumpet they were turned loose on the jews the persecution of the jews supernatural devils nearly 2 000 years then loosed by stalin hitler upon the jews you say well that isn't rome it's the same spirit they've done the same things that they did to the christians in the old pagan roman days now watch the natural israel and the spiritual church now as we separate it here there was a dictatorship that rose up in germany and one that rose up in italy and and began a persecution against the jews and brother branham attached that to the to the sixth trumpet and those demons coming out is that clear and persecuting the jews because it was the same spirits but those spirits were bound they were limited in what they could do they were held back they couldn't go in and do what they want they were bound in the river the river had to drive so they could cross over and when when it was time they did and what did they do the same thing they always done persecute the jews two thousand years the spirit through the roman people the roman church could not move but the same spirit coming up first down there in mussolini in rome the dictator so that same spirit started first in italy under mussolini and now he loosed upon under the sixth seal these two hundred thousand spiritual demons started in rome germany hitler and notice over in the bible where they received they received power as kings but wasn't crowned a dictator is not crowned king just received power as kings brother branham is referring to the ten kings right and that's coming we agree with that that's ten kings who receive power as kings but he's showing it's already happened it's already gave us a fulfillment it'll have a great fulfillment but it's already had a fulfillment you have to ask yourself why there's some things that brother branham says that it can only be this way friends because there's certain things that have to happen while he's standing on this earth or else he's not in the bible when he comes to his position and his ministry comes and unveils there's certain things that must happen and because if it doesn't happen he's not who he says he was and this is one of the things that must happen while he's here hallelujah oh what a time what a time if we look back and see these things he says there is that roman empire bound there by what the ecclesiastical powers what what are they bound by i thought it was euphrates the ecclesiastical powers which rome pagan rome became papal rome and was bound there in its traditions of christian don't you think when pope francis stands up there and smiles and talks about loving everybody and washes prisoners feet don't you think he's not anointed to the same devil that every other pope's been anointed from and if he didn't have this form of christianity he would absolutely annihilate everything that stands against him but he's got to come in by flatteries because that's the pattern the pattern doesn't change they always come in by flatteries and then they turn come in by flatteries and turn that's the way it has to be that's the word and it's bound there in its traditions of christian what part of christian and superstitions it had of rome putting together all these worship of women and all these other kind of stuff and christmas days and holidays and holy days and things it's been bound with that tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against christian principles it has to keep looking christian come in by flatteries bind all the protestants together get get the political system together and then turn it's bound with tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against christian principles still the same ungodly pagan spirit and that spirit caught into the nations of the world according to the prophecies of ezekiel and the rest of them and they were loosed upon the jew who know nothing of the spirit so now we find out that that this sounding of the sixth trumpet now friends don't don't don't get me wrong i don't believe that the sixth trumpet is finished because we know that all seven trumpets sound under the sixth trump and amen in in the in the full opening of the sixth seal takes place when the two witnesses are here preaching to the 144 thousand i believe that wholeheartedly but what's happening is the same thing that happened in joel's prophecy it happened it happened and it happened same thing's happening here because certain things have to happen while brother branham's here so that he can point them out and point it to the scripture and point to his own ministry and god allowed these things to happen so that the prophet could do that i just want to show you something i'll show you why let's take our bibles and turn to revelation chapter 6. i want you to physically see something in the bible i want to read the sixth seal because the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet and the sixth vial all go together and the sixth seal brother branham now remember remember the three woes world war one world war ii world war three you got that world war ii is the sixth trumpet brother branham said the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet sound at the same time you got that they sound at the same time verse 12 chapter 6 verse 12 when i beheld then he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman of every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and he said to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand chapter 7 and after these things after what after the six seals after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascend from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god and their foreheads so here here we see the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet sound at the same time in world war ii breaks out and persecution against the jews come in and then there's a cry saying hold back the four winds it started stop it hold it back remember in the sixth trumpet there were four angels and and the sixth seal after these things there's four angels that are to hurt the earth and the trumpets there's four angels released out of euphrates to hurt the earth and now after these things he says hold it back until what until we seal the servants of our god in their foreheads what happened after world war ii whose ministry began to come up the seventh church age messenger ministry became up and began giving the seal of god amen the baptism of the holy ghost and began to seal the servants and also after that time now there's going to be two witnesses moses and elijah in the form of men in israel that will go to israel preach the true atonement and they will be sealed 144 000. we got that so it began but it had to stop why did it begin and why did they have to stop because the prophet had to be here to point it out it had to be going on and i'm getting ready to show you why this is good this is good friends so then he says hold it back till we seal them and it says i heard the number which were sealed there were 140 and 4 000 and he starts naming 12 000 from each tribe that were sealed so when are these sealed in revelations 11 under the two witnesses after the rapture amended during the tribulation period are we right so now between the sixth seal turn over to chapter eight verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal so between the sixth seal and the seventh seal 144 000 jews have to be marked that's revelations 11. that's why he had to hold back the four wins now now we're in revelations chapter eight is everybody in revelation chapter eight he starts in verse seven the trumpets one trumpet two trumpet three trumpet four trumpet all the way down through through chapter nine chapter nine is the fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet but all of a sudden there's a gap again something stops we don't go to the seventh trumpet just like after the sixth seal we don't go to the seventh seal we go to revelations chapter seven where the 144 thousand are called out and sealed now we come to the sixth trumpet and the same exact thing happens we don't go to the seventh trumpet there's another chapter put in between and that chapter happens to be revelation chapter 10 the seventh church messenger the descending of the mighty angel because that's the sealing of the gentiles so brother branham said in between the sixth and seventh seal and the sixth and seventh trumpet this messenger has to come amen and he has to do the ceiling and he has to reveal the word all of this has to happen when between the sixth and seventh trumpet where is revelations 10 between the sixth and seventh trumpets why did world war ii have to break out why the second woe why those demons come out and then why hold it back because it has to happen between the sixth and the seventh trumpet is revelations 10. had to be amen that had to be already cracked open had to be already declared had to be already a persecution against the jews so the prophet could say i came between the sixth and the seventh trumpet the word is absolutely perfect now you have to hold back the four winds so that the servants of the lord can be sealed talking about the 144 thousand and in that time the the gentile bride is called at that same time then after the rapture the gentile bride is gone and the ceiling of the 144 thousand then it's released and that's why brother branham says that those two witnesses they opened the sixth seal why because they bring it back from its holding pattern being held back and now it's fully released when they begin now they can call for plagues to come they can stop it so it rains not they can call for earthquakes whenever they want why because there's no more holding back because there's no more ceiling now these two witnesses are on the scene and they open the sixth seal it's written in our bible it's in order in the scriptures and we've seen it we've seen it in the history and it's coming again all these things are coming again now brother ma'am he's going to talking in feast of trumpets now he's been talking about the persecution to the jews and those demon spirits coming out of euphrates he's talking about all of that and now he's going to switch gears now there's some marvelous things that are happening world war ii breaks out the second woe the persecution against the jews we got that the opening of the sixth trumpet all right between the sixth and seventh seal the sixth and seventh trumpet you have world war ii persecution of the jews all of this tribulation happening but then it stopped it's held back and right at that time amen after after world war ii is stopped we see a ministry rise on the scene it's a prophetic ministry and brings us right to what's in between the 6th and 7th trumpet revelations 10 brings us right to revelations 10. hallelujah but during his lifetime something else remarkable takes place something that's never happened before there's this vatican ii council from 1962 to 1965 and there's four meetings in those in those years and those four meetings in vatican 2 are the catholics attempt at the ecumenical movement the catholics begin to change their rules and regulations and begin to let down the bars so that they can accept other religions and it happens in the prophet's lifetime both world war ii both world war one and world war ii and the ecumenical move the world council of churches started in 1948 just after the war right when brother branham's ministry was really taking off you see the parallel tracks god and the devil are running on parallel tracks the battle plan all the way through and so now you see all these things that are happening in his life world war one when he's a boy world war ii then his ministry springs up then the world council of churches began then we come to the end of his ministry and now vatican ii amen the old roman system starts calling for all the little all the holy harlot churches to come back that's what started it right here it didn't start some other lifetime what started the ecumenical move what started the mother calling back all the harlots right here vatican 2 1962-1965 and the last meeting was december 8th three weeks before brother branham dies perfectly on time he says in the feast of trumpets notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit now 20 years later after that war we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit you know how significant this is when those demons were released out of the river euphrates they went and started a persecution against the jews now see the persecution against the jews is always physical because the jews are through a certain birth order and in that birth order israel is sprinkled the true israelites are sprinkled through that birth order so if you can annihilate all of that seed you've got all of god's seed that come up through israel but the gentiles are not so the gentiles are a spiritual seed that pops up it's not like you can say if we get rid of all the germans we've got rid of all the children of god you can't do that with the gentiles like you can with the jews so that's why the jews is always a physical persecution and the gentiles are always a spiritual persecution he tries to kill the jews physically and he tries to kill the gentiles spiritually see the path we're on the same path so because all of god's jewish children are going to pop up in that family he's got to wipe out that family to take out god's seed through the jews and kill god's promise to have jews to have a nation but it's not that way with the gentiles you can't kill all the armenians you can't kill all the italians you can't do that it pops up everywhere so you have to kill them spiritually with spiritual death through deception and so now when all these demons come flooding out these two hundred thousand thousand demons coming out you see exactly what their nature is you see what their spirit is because they go right into hitler's army and what do they do all of a sudden they they start they start having a terrible war i mean hitler's army was unbelievable they were fast they were efficient they had the best technology their scientists started creating things on a rapid scale what were they anointed by demon spirits you can see it if you study world war ii you can see those are demon spirits let loose right and then a hatred toward the jewish people amen and they would come up with all kinds of systems and camps and transport systems and tracking systems just to persecute the jews that's the nature of those demon powers but remember it's physical to the jews it's spiritual to the gentiles and after god said hold back the winds and world war ii stopped and the persecution of the jews stopped so that they can move into their homeland to receive the two witnesses to receive the feast of atonement when that stopped now all those demons left the natural army of hitler and they moved into the ecclesiastical realms those demons didn't go back into euphrates brother branham said now the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit now 20 years later after that war we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit now those demons move into vatican ii in the ecumenical move and brother brenham was here to declare it do you know how supernatural that is you know how unbelievable the history matches the scriptures matches the testimonies matches everything feast of trump has noticed we find now that the natural power under the natural to a natural nation israel was loosed there and what did it do it went and made war and how it murdered and persecuted now in ecclesia now in the ecclesiastical realm i hope that god opens your eyes to this now because i realize this is just not speaking to this church here this tape goes worldwide and i don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings but just to tell the truth now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened from the natural revival the old pagan rome went forth on the jews which has always been their enemy the lion with teeth and everything it stopped stomped down and broke the people rome always been god's enemy and it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed it went to the dictators of the world and unleashed a man of war and unleashed a physical persecution because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed hallelujah what has it done in the cunningness as he said and and come to like flatteries and what has he done he's bringing the protestant ecumenical council of world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride now how loosed in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride because they're calling the denominations it's not loosed upon the denominations it's loosed upon the bride but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time the bride will not go through the tribulation period the bride will not go through that time amen the bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see ministers can't you see that brethren so what's been happening since the prophet left the scene those spirits that went into the armies of hitler went into the nations and began a persecution and war and all this stuff where did they go they went to the ecclesiastical realms in vatican ii they went into the ecumenical move and now it was loosed in the ecumenical move first it was loosed in physical war then held back it's been loosed in the ecclesiastical now now it's been infiltrating and dropping the bars and dropping the bars and dropping the bars until now there's no difference between these churches now there's really no there's really no doctrinal difference that we'll stand apart and fight for there's nothing that we're going to stand our ground on doctrinally we'll just let it fade to the side and we believe in a trinity and we believe in in the salvation through the blood of jesus and we believe in these things and that's all you have to believe in and that's good enough and you can be part of the buddy system now what are they doing they're being gathered to the slaughter gathered to armageddon gather to the slaughter amen because in order to do that you have to reject the truth you have to reject scriptures you have to lay it down and turn aside and you have to reject jesus christ to come into the ecumenical movement and so now in the ecclesiastical realm he's been gathering amen and vatican do them in gathering the protestants to themselves and they're moving in and remember the video we showed two years ago of kenneth copeland going back to the catholic church do you remember that kenneth copeland he gets a message from pope francis and then there's this there's this bishop of the anglican church there and he's welcoming them in and talking about now we want to keep we want to keep the final prayer of jesus christ when he said we want to be one amen father may they be one amen and we should be one and he's missing the whole point because jesus said may they be one as we're one well how was god and the father one are jesus and the father he was one because he did everything that the father said he was the fulfillment of the word the thought of jesus christ they were in perfect unity and harmony on the word because he was the originator word this was the expression of the word it came from the mind of god and manifest in the body of jesus christ and he was the fulfillment of the mind of god and that that there the fulfillment of the mind of god is oneness do we have that the fulfillment of the mind of god is true oneness and so now if you're going to be one we have to be the one the way that jesus and the father are one perfectly aligned to the thought of god perfectly aligned in the word hallelujah praise the lord god is good god bless you brother amen so now we've got to come back to perfect alignment with the word if we're going to be one the way jesus and the father are one we can't just be one by letting down the bars and ignoring the word and acting like the scripture doesn't count and saying you lay down your word i'll lay down my word we'll all lay down the word and come to as little word as possible so that we don't disagree with one another that's not being won as god and the father were one that's a false unity amen and that's that's that's driven by demon powers and what's it coming to do it's coming to bring a persecution against those who won't go along with it it's coming to bring a persecution against those who don't want to drop the bars who don't want to ignore the word who don't want to turn their back on jesus christ but want the full word with the full manifestation of the full word in their lives and will not compromise on the word and what do they do they want to shut it up hallelujah brother bennett says in the laodicean church age of the church age book the wheat and the tares which from the first age until now have grown side by side are harvested what nicea set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of the organization the false church turns from any vestige of truth and with political might reinforces herself with state backing and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer remember the same spirit that was in nazi germany is the same spirit that's in the ecumenical move but there still has to look christian but there'll come a time when everything's wrapped up tight and everybody's let down the bar so much they don't even know what christian is anymore and now true christianity will look like hate true christianity will look like intolerance true christianity will look like it's evil and then they'll justify themselves in eradicating this thing that's against our harmony our unity what's bringing the whole world to peace there's these people who won't go along with it and keep crying out against it and they won't shut up they won't be shut up they keep saying it's wrong they keep telling other people it's wrong then we've got to stop it so build a system to eradicate forever the true believer same spirit it just has had to look christian but for 50 years now it's been changing the definition of christian it's been working hard for 50 years to change christian ideas and christian principles and christian morals so that they can do what they want to do to take power and control and still look christian why do you think the morality in christianity has been falling so fast so far why do you think it's been coming crashing down all around us because it's an attempt by these ecclesiastical spirits to make the way to drain euphrates so that the kings can come across held back by the ecclesiastics but been whittling away and whittling away the barrier and witting away the barrier till there's no clear distinction and we don't know what true christianity is anymore and now the model of it is in the bride of jesus christ and she's such a contrast to the rest of the christian world that the evil spirits have to remove the true christianity so that their facade can continue hallelujah praise god you know the seals you know everything you know the message everything's revealed he says now eradicate the true believer but just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat is gathered to the garnet there is nothing for us to be afraid of you stand as true to that word as you've always stood because that's your purpose on this earth is to fight back against this devil fight back against these ecclesial systems and stay true to jesus christ which is the word made manifest in your age the word may manifest in your age that's jesus christ and we have to stay true to jesus christ and are they going to come against her absolutely are they going to try to shut her down it's prophesied to happen will they do it no she'll be gathered into the garner so if if i'm going to be gathered into the garner when this happens amen there's going to come a time when all the world all the ecumenical system is gathering against the bride to try to shut her down and i'm not going to be a pipsqueak keeping quiet not saying anything because all of a sudden all we're going to get gathered away and i never had my chance to get a few licks in but we're going to fight the battle right now we're going to overcome the devil right now we're going to declare the truth not just in word but in deed and manifestation of the holy ghost we're going to live this word amen so much so that they've got to stop you because you're contrary to the rest of the system and we're going to live it we're going to be bold about it and we're going to stand true not me not arrogant not angry but true to the word never backing down one bit from the word until he comes and gathers us away and says well done my good and faithful servant i don't want to be hiding in a corner the day he comes to take us home i don't want to be cowering from the battle when he comes to take us home i want to be standing on the front lines giving it everything i've got with a life that matches the word with a marriage that matches the word with children that match the word amen with a church that matches the word with my personal private life that matches the word with a prayer life with a vindication with a prayer with healing with the anointing of the holy ghost i want to be standing there on the front line that day he comes and gathers us to the garden i don't want to be hiding under my bed saying lord please god i don't want to be no brothers and sisters i have been called you have been called to take the battle on the front lines in satan's eden right here today is the place that we fight we don't fight with fists and we don't fight with with stones what do we fight with we fight with the word of god we don't just say words amen the word has to be on display it's got to be lived brother brennan said in christ is a mystery god revealed in his church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by god being the body that god dwelled in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last day what is she she is his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for this last day and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil's howling these great organizations so set up something to close her up what is this what's been happening for the last 50 years since vatican ii building the system building the system tearing down the walls drying up euphrates everything is ready changing christianity changing the word changing what it means to be a believer getting it ready for what for for the for the old roman empire to rise again and it'll happen so fast it'll shock you remember when when hitler came to power amen germany had been defeated in a war before they signed a decree in 1919 that they're they're they're going to pay for their crimes they're gonna you know demilitarize somewhat and all of this then hitler come to power amen in 1933. in 33 1933 he started building back the system building back the system building back the system and he launched a war in 1939 just six years after he started doing it between five and six years after and they were one of the most powerful military forces on the earth why they were anointed by 200 000 000 demons out of the river euphrates see it doesn't take very long for everything you know to be normal to flip on its head in germany overnight everything changed amen in poland overnight everything changed in holland overnight everything changed it doesn't take very long for everything to be flipped why because those same 200 000 000 demons that work there are the same ones working now preparing and building preparing and building and when it launches out it'll be so fast it'll make your head spin but we know what's coming and we're prepared for it we're not afraid of it because we've got the sword in our hands amen we're standing here ready to be gathered into the garner hallelujah these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not
