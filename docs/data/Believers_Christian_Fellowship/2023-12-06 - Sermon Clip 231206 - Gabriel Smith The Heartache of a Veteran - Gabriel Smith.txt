TRANSCRIPT
========================================
no matter what happens in life to me I I've come to a place to where there's there there's a settledness in my life that I've never felt on this measure before and and and to me I'm at a spot where it's like Lord I want every I want everybody to feel this you know what I mean I mean I mean when you when you when you have that reality of God it's like it it's like everything that you've heard on the tapes is real in your life you understand what I'm saying I mean it's like I mean it's like to to maybe for me it's such an extreme of of my past and then the now but it's so overwhelming but to me I look and I think I don't know how you tick in your mind and in your heart but to me friends I'll be honest with you when I'm sitting in row five it's all I can do not to busten praise God and to me it's like because it's real it's not emotion it it's a life that pulsates and you God you talk to God and God talks back and God helps you overcome something and whatever you're struggling with you have the ability that whenever you're dealing with it on the job you can see Satan come at you and you can flip the script on him and he's left speechless and you walk away like thank you Lord oh man you're so good right to me friends that's that to me that's the whole point of being an overcomer that that that we as grown men I don't you know it used to be all about being a tough guy and you know trying to be uh hard and but but to me listen I I I can't help but to hardly listen to a a a song and just weep I'm I'm driving on the way to work and on the way home weeping you know just the the presence of the Lord so sweet and and I'm thinking th I if if if I can feel this way at the ending of time what in the world is heaven going to be like yeah oh my friends and if you if and if and if if you don't feel that way and you got all these burdens and all these problems listen there is a fountain you can go to there is a refuge there's a place of hope that you can I I promise you look if if you don't know how to get there then then then then then talk to Mama talk to Daddy look if you're a grown man and you don't know how to get there talk to talk to our pastor somebody somebody can talk to One find one of these old oak trees but but but run get there as fast as you [Applause] can don't don't don't sit there in a in a in a halfway filling friends I'm not talking about you got the amen loud like brother Gabe I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is the joy bells of God ought to be flowing in your life in a way that's so special to you that that when you're on the job when you're at home when when you're by yourself whatever it may be wherever you're at and nobody's around and you're a three states away the joy bells of God is still going off
