========================================

So here we've got the the earth spinning so that we get day day and night just as the Lord wants it. But the earth is orbiting around the sun once a year. Every 365 and a/4 days we go right around the sun. And we call that a year. But to do that we've got to be traveling at the speed of 67,000 m an hour. And that's what we're doing. You're sitting right here feeling like you're sitting still, but you're actually moving around the sun at 67,000 mph. That's 19 miles every second. So, but it's a lot more complicated than that because the sun, our sun and our whole solar system is also orbiting the center of our of the Milky Way and it's going round the Milky Way every 230 million years. we do a galactic year, an orbit of the of the center of our uh Milky Way galaxy. But to do that, we have to be traveling at 514,000 m an hour, which is 143 miles every second. But since the whole of our solar system is racing through space, so we just kind of think the sun's here and the Earth's going around it and the other planets like, but it's not like that. It's racing through space and all these other things are keeping up with it, circling around it. But it's a lot more complicated than that because our entire galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, is hurtling through space at a speed of 1.3 million miles hour. So, while we're sitting here, every second we've done 361 miles. But to set that all in order that it all works in perfect harmony, it takes an infinite mind. Amen. He had to plan it all. If we had infinite power and you wanted to put one planet in orbit around a star, you wouldn't be able to do it unless you also had the infinite mind. If you had infinite power to do it, you'd still need an infinite mind. And every satellite, there's thousands and thousands of satellites that man has put up around the earth. There's not one of them that's in a stable orbit. Not one. Every single one of them has to be adjusted continuously to keep it in orbit because it's it's being influenced by all the other planets, being influenced by the moon. It's being being influenced uh by everything else that's out there in space. It keeps putting it out of its orbit. So, they have to keep driving it back into to keep it in a circular orbit. So, uh it's complicated. And I think the way that David said in the Psalms, "Great is our Lord and of great power. His understanding is infinite. Amen. That sums it up.
