[0:43] uh Church problems Church splits false
[0:47] doctrines that's a sick seal right there
[0:49] it's an interruption of
[0:52] nature if all those things still affect
[0:55] you it still seals the book right
[0:58] because if all those things affects you
[1:01] how are you going to be
[1:04] God how how will you rule if those
[1:07] things make you question who you are and
[1:10] question God that's right I'm not coming
[1:12] to church anymore I've been such a good
[1:14] person where is God in my need where is
[1:17] God in my time of need how could this

[1:47] bromism this is happening in the message
[1:50] we can't trust listen if you a person
[1:52] who have a spirit of racism in you you
[1:55] cannot take the book that's right if you
[1:57] have any kind of prejudice you cannot
[2:00] take the book if you even feel inferior
[2:03] to someone else you cannot take the
[2:06] book you need to get over
[2:09] yourself praise the Lord that's what the
[2:11] seals of your life are you cannot take
[2:15] the book unless the revelation of this
[2:17] day breaks those seals away so you
[2:20] personally can take the right to rule
[2:23] you can never overcome and what do we
[2:25] want to rule first the Bor woman and a
[2:28] son need to be cast out how can we cast
[2:31] them out we read a quote last night you
[2:33] cannot do this by yourself you cannot do
[2:36] this by works you cannot do it by church
[2:39] this is why everything fails right now
[2:41] tongues prophecies interpretations
[2:44] fasting prayer
[2:46] religiosity praying five times a day
[2:48] having prayer meetings having Holy Ghost
[2:50] Services nothing can work because those
[2:53] seals of your life have to be broken
[2:56] there's no other way that you can have
[2:58] the mystery of God and can still be
[3:00] affected by those
[3:03] things praise be to God it is Christ
[3:06] revealed in you God is dwelling in you
[3:10] this is the original purpose amen
