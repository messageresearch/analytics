========================================

this is just to coming back to our subject to say that seeing Jesus as a single unit as a man as a a Corporal body as an individual standing in appearance will never do you any good no benefit if he was for benefit pilot would have had benefits herods Herod would have had benefit Judas would have had benefit Ben but it's not that way even if he would come tonight you would have no benefit no benefit at all sometimes we have that Pentecostal or Baptist mindset that if I see him appearing something will happen in my life he could be appearing all the time and you are setting him at not that's right yes sir because you can only see him by faith in the message we s we would see Jesus 1957 the prophet of God said all of us want want want to see him I want to see him you want to see him and that's the desire of the Christian world is to see him that was the desire of the Orthodox Jew uh world of the Jew Jew Jewish church when Jesus came they wanted to see the Messiah but they didn't believe him when he was manifested the main thing is when he manifested we will see the when the the where the What the how or very important in seeing Jesus he said they did believe him when he was manifested and I wonder sometimes if that's just about isn't what we are to we long to see Jesus but when he appears we think it's something else we turn him down the disciples did that they want one time in the boat dark the water tossing the boat on each side and they saw Jesus coming on the water right but they were afraid they thought he was a ghost so they saw him coming but they were still afraid so the how to see him the where to see him went to see him very critical
