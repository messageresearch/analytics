you Lord once again for your privilege that you've given us and God may we always take it as a privilege to gather together and God we've come to sing your Praises but we've come to hear from you now we've entered into that part of the service Lord where we're asking you Lord to come on the scene and break the bread of life may you feed us by your own hand Lord I pray you would take this vessel to mine under your control as I surrender to you may you come and speak your word of eternal life Lord for we are utterly completely dependent upon you for everything Lord we're trusting in you also Lord to keep your word and do what you told us you would do we've gathered together now we trust Lord that through the foolishness of preaching you'll save us Lord that you'll restore us and heal us and train us up in the way that is right we commit ourselves to you Lord and we want to receive your word give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you have for us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you all while we're standing let's take our Bibles thank you musicians we're going to turn to the book of Ephesians as most of you know they were predicting uh some uh maybe freezing rain or ice possibly tonight looked like all the models were showing uh 10:00 or thereafter somewhere around there so we're going to try our best to shorten the service and get out early so everybody can get home before anything begins so I'm going to say God bless you for being here but we're going to do our best to keep it short amen so pull fast and pull short amen we're going to work together and we thank God that we're able to be together also uh Sunday evening I let you know that brother Jim Swanson was going to be preaching over at bible Believers uh uh in two weeks on the February the 16th but I just found out also that Brother Kyle wer is going to be preaching there this Sunday the 9th so he'd appreciate your prayers I'm sure so pray for both of those brothers that'll be back toback Sundays this Sunday and then the following Sunday so we want to remember them and the Saints there in prayer and let's look at Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 verse 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace for there is one body in one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen God bless you as you have your seats may God bless us as we look at his word amen so I want to go back and look at the the beginning of this uh reading here in verse one I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love me there's a there's a thought that I had I've been actually dwelling on this thought for a couple weeks and uh it's actually very fitting tonight because it's just a simple short thought for a a night when we need a simple short service amen so I feel like it's very fitting that we Minister on this tonight amen and I want to preach on forbearing and longsuffering forbearing and longsuffering and we realized that last Sunday we started preaching on the the divine nature the attributes of Christ and how that it actually is God's Own nature that he empowers us with it's not our nature but his nature but we find also that there's a command for us to be long-suffering and forbearing amen and I think we're going to need his help with that too but he said with longsuffering and forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace So I want to look at these words longsuffering and forbearing and the word longsuffering can mean patience or endurance or constancy but there's another meaning which I think is implied here because he he's talking about longsuffering and forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of Peace So This is in relation to keeping unity and peace so there's a definition of this word long suffer uing that means forbearance longsuffering slowness and avenging wrongs slowness and avenging wrongs think about that when we read it again with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace I think that's the definition that applies here and then forbearing means to bear with to hold up to hold oneself erect and firm to sustain to Bear to endure so we are supposed to do that for one another not just holding up ourselves and and holding ourselves direct and bearing under the low but we're supposed to Bear one another bear for forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity uh of the spirit in the bond of Peace so that's what I want to speak on Long uh forbearing and longsuffering there's other applications of those words but I want to have the application that I that's referred to here when it has to do with us deal dealing with one another we're going to need we're going to need forbearing and longsuffering so why if we all have come to Perfection do we need forbearing and longsuffering I think maybe because as long as we're in this flesh and we're human beings and we're striving amen for the Mastery that we're going to need forbearing and longsuffering for one another that's why the Commandments here in Ephesians amen because we all know that we're struggling in this life and what are we struggling with we're struggling with ourselves and we're struggling to overcome and Reign the outer man in to the to the to the control of the inner man so that Christ can have his way in all of us and so we're going to need some forbearing and longsuffering let's turn to Colossians chapter 3 Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of Merc Mercy kindness humbleness uh humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye U I want to read the other next verse too and above all these things put on charity it's love which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful pray praise God so so we see here this word longsuffering and forbearing again referring to one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye so this is amazing I want to take this verse and put it in the light of the message that we've been hearing on forgiveness the one brother Gabe preached and the one I preached myself then it says here that if any have a quarrel against any If any man have a quarrel against any what's he supposed to do forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye so we're supposed to forgive each other the same way Christ forgave us oh that's really good because that's really hard that's why it's so good because who's he referring to here he's not referring to you with a quarrel with somebody in the world right he's talking about in the church you say there's no way that could be in the church oh okay well you haven't been in the church very long amen so we supposed to forgive one another as Christ forgave us well how did Christ forgive me did Christ wait for me to repent or did he forgive me before amen Christ forgave me before before I even came to him to repent before I even asked his forgiveness he forgave me before amen he forgave the whole nation of Jews father forgive them they know not what they do it before they had a chance to ask for forgiveness he forgave them freely he forgave them willingly and then here's the next thing did Jesus ask me to pay for my wrongs or did he pay for my wrongs yeah amen so how are we supposed to forgive one another even as Christ forgave us we're supposed to forgive forgive our brothers forgive them they you don't even have to require a repentance we should for give them anyways we shouldn't require they make it right or they pay the price or they make it up to me because Christ didn't forgive us that way we should forgive each other freely and we should Bear all the consequences of whatever wrong was done just let it go just bear the consequences and let them let let your brother off of the hook because that's the way Jesus forgave me yeah and so and in order to do that it's going to take longsuffering and forbearance with one another it's going to take humbleness of mind Mercy meekness all of these attributes are going to come together amen for us to live together we need this in our homes we need this in a church we need wherever you have a a a lumping of people together how big of a lumping well I guess two people in a home a marriage you're going to need this amen so this is something that we're going to need and we're going to need the attributes of Christ in our lives for us to be able to live this out to make it flesh right the brother bham said in the message the church and its condition from 1956 he said but look if that Dove of meekness is gone from you brother there's something wrong there's something wrong when you can't bear with one another when you can't forgive every person from the very depths of your heart no matter what they've done or what they've said if you can't forgive them from the death Jesus said if you don't forgive everyone man his trespasses from your heart neither does your heavenly father forgive you so this is a serious subject but but he said there's a problem if we can't bear with one another and there's a problem if we can't forgive every person from the very depths of our heart that's a problem so what's the problem the problem is there's still too much of me that's the problem because guess what there are some hurts that are hard to get over there are some things that are extremely painful there are some things it's not just trivial it's not something you just lightly toss off amen it's going to take the very nature of Jes Jesus Christ coming into us to give us the heart the meekness the love amen his love so that we can forbear so that we can suffer long so that we can forgive and there's something wrong when we can't bear with one another amen just note that there's something wrong and you say well what's wrong well obviously if I can't bear with that person it's their fault they're being super difficult I say you know there's a problem we can't bear with one another and the person we should look at is the person in the mirror and say God why can't I just die to myself why can't I stop defending myself why can't I stop getting offended why can't I stop being so hurt yeah I mean there's reasons but we need God to heal us we can't just stuff these things down and put a jar a lid on the jar and act like they're not there but we need actual Deliverance ourselves in order to be F be able to flesh this out we need God's help and that's why it's so good to look at these things and say you know what this is the Commandment this is what Paul's telling us this is how we need to act with one another and if I can't come to this I need something more from God to work on me so that I can come to fulfillment of this scripture because this is the word and the word has to be made flesh and where is the word going to be made flesh in the bride amen are you part of the Bride then this word has to be made flesh in you and I it can't just stay on the pages of the Bible it can't be a good teaching it can't be a good idea it has to actually become flesh amen and how many of you think God wants us to flesh out this word this commandment from the Apostle Paul for the Saints do you think God wants us to flesh that out then how are we going to flesh it out unless somebody needs forgiven amen like we've been saying I I want I I want so bad for my attitudes to change I I'm praying about it all the time that God will get a hold of this vessel and help me die to the outer man because I I I I always look at offenses and it then it always is the same Story how could this be happening and why is this happening and why did they do this to me and blah blah blah blah blah and and I need to get past that where I can actually die to myself and it doesn't matter anymore for if God allows it it has a purpose and it gives me an opportunity to flesh out the very nature of Jesus Christ and what happens too often is I flesh out the nature of the old man of Chad Lamb and I'm tired of that guy I want to flesh out the very nature of Jesus Christ so God God's going to give us lots of opportunities how many have had lots of opportunities well just hold on you're going to get some more because this has to be made flesh it has to be made flesh and you can say why did my brother do that to me well in order for you to forgive your brother you to F to fulfill the scriptures that's a scripture that has to be fulfilled in order you to forgive a brother you have to some point along the way have to have a brother who needs forgiven amen righten so you mean the very fact that I have a brother needs forgiven is part of the word yes we can't fulfill the word unless we have the opportunity to fulfill the word so we look at everything as a negative but we got to stop looking at everything as a negative and look at them as the potential for God to manifest his word every situation no matter how hard it is there's situations that break our hearts there's situations that destroy us there's situ situations that mess us up on the inside we can't help it they do you know there was situations that mess up brother brandham on the inside right they're there but they're an opportunity for God to manifest himself and I want God to take that opportunity and I want him to manifest himself if you could turn with me to 1 Timothy 1 1 Timothy 1 and verse 12 the Apostle Paul is writing here to Timothy and he says and I thank Christ Jesus our lord who ha enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurers but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our Lord Jesus was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus that is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of who I am the chief how be it for this cause I obtained Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him to everlasting life so Paul starts off saying I was a rotten person I was rotten and you know the Christian World especially around uh uh Judaism around uh the Middle East there they knew it they knew in Damascus they knew it in Jerusalem they knew what kind of person he was when he was on the road to Damascus he was stricken down amen and God wants to take ananas to go speak to him anas say you know what I've heard what manner of man this is how he's persecuting and doing all these wrong things and Paul said this is beautiful I want to go back to verse 16 how be it for this cause I obtained Mercy this is why God had mercy on me that in me first Jesus might show forth all longsuffering amen all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should Hereafter believe on him for the life Everlasting what did God what what is Paul saying I was a rotten scoundrel ever everybody knew I was a rotten scoundrel I was doing everything wrong but God showed mercy on me for this one reason so that you can believe he'll show mercy on you and show the longsuffering of God because God has been longsuffering with all of us God has been patient with me he's covered my sins he has forgiven me he's been slow to wrath and slow to punish amen and this is what Paul's saying now he said now I'm an example of the longsuffering of God so that you could believe let's go to Second Peter now second Peter chapter 3 second Peter chapter 3 we'll look at verse 13 said nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you so what's Peter saying Peter saying this longsuffering of the Lord is salvation where would we be if he wasn't longsuffering where would we be if he wasn't forbearing where would we be if he wasn't merciful if he wasn't kind if he wasn't loving where would you and I be and if that's what Christ has done for us what should we do for others because we should be the example of what was done for us we should forgive the way he forgave us we should love the way he loved us we should be longsuffering with others the way he was longsuffering with us we should forebear others the way he forbear for us amen Jesus modeled forbearing and longsuffering when he was here on the earth cuz all around him were people who weren't understanding they weren't getting the program he was there and and good things were happening and they loved him but they they just were missing the mark all the time let's go to chap uh Luke Chapter N I want to pull out just a couple of these and show Christ in his Earthly Journey here all right Luke chapter 9 Luke chapter 9 verse 54 9 and 54 when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord wil thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did but he turned and rebuked him and said ye know not what manner of spirit you are of for the son of man has not come to destroy 's lives but to save them and they went to another Village so here they got the whole wrong program of what's going on but he's got to be patient with these guys they don't understand he's got to be longsuffering and and they think he's going to set up his Earthly Kingdom immediately and he's going to banish all the Romans and cast them all out and set up the Throne of David and they wouldn't accept him and let's just do like Elias did of old and let's call down fire and he says you don't even know what Spirit you're of that's not why the son of man has come he's got to be patient but you know what he didn't throw him out of his he didn't throw him out of his church he didn't throw him out of his confidence as friends and as disciples he kept them right where they were amen let's look again at at at uh verse 46 same chapter then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest and Jesus perceived the thought of their heart and took a child and said him by him and said unto him whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great so here Jesus is going along and they want to call fire down from heaven over here on this group and they're they're over here arguing amongst themselves who's the greatest in the kingdom and they have no idea what's going on but you know what he loved them he was patient with them he would correct them but he didn't cast them out he never chased them away amen Jesus many times had to suffer with them even many times he makes the statement when they when they couldn't believe when the when the man had the epileptic child and his disciples weren't able to cast him out and they brought him to Jesus and said I brought them to your disciples and they couldn't cast them out and Jesus said over and over you you faithless generation how long will I suffer you same word as as suffer the same word as longsuffering uh the same root word as longsuffering in how long will I be patient with you Jesus had to be patient in his Earthly Journey but he was patient he was longsuffering he knew that they would eventually get it amen oh aren't you glad he knew you would eventually get it amen and even now we don't all the way get it but aren't you glad he knows you'll get it he forgave us yesterday he's forgiving us today we thought oh we look back sometimes in our lives and we say oh God was so merciful so longsuffering he was so patient with me back then I'm so thankful he was he's probably being just as patient with you now as he was back then he's probably every bit as longsuffering today as he was 20 years ago amen because we still got some growing to do and if God's going to be longsuffering and patient with me forbearing I should be that for my brethren brother M says when Christ when Christians lose faith in one another the devil gets to church right then that's right we got to have faith and confidence in one another and bear with one another I mean that doesn't mean we always agree with each other and that doesn't mean there won't ever be any mistakes but we got to have confidence in one another and we got to bear with one another with the things that need born amen remember bearing with your brother is not because everything's going perfect bearing with your brothers because maybe something's not perfect there's a difference there's a mistake there's an error there's immaturity there's misunderstanding there's something going on that causes us to bear with our Brethren amen uh I want to go to Galatians now if we can go to Galatians Chapter 2 Galatians chapter 2:1 Galatians 2 And1 it says but when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to his face because he was to be blamed and Paul corrected him because he had been eating with all the Gentiles all the Christian Gentiles but when a delegation from James out of Jerusalem come down he separated amen because he didn't want to be seen fellowshipping with the Gentiles because of old Jewish Customs amen and and Paul Paul had a special gift Paul was was the Apostle to the Gentiles and Paul could see what was going to happen and he had a special discernment and understanding and even though Peter was missing it Paul caught it yeah and Paul wasto stood him to his face and corrected him amen but you never see Peter retaliate in the Bible even in the great Jerusalem Council when when uh when when uh Paul came back and gave the testimony of how God was saving the Gentiles and all these things the Pharisees rose up and says what we must teach them circumcision we must teach them some dietary laws and Paul was saying no these are Gentiles these aren't Jews it was Peter who stood up and defended him and citing what happened in cornelius's house it was Peter who comes at the end of the the the scripture in second Peter we just read and says uh even as Paul has written to you and he refers to Paul's writings which some things are hard to be understood as are the other scriptures and he elevates Paul's writings to the Church on the same level as the scriptures that's Peter amen just because they had a difference just because Paul was correcting Peter amen didn't mean they had to have a falling away and not ever work together and not have respect for each other anymore and he says in questions and answers he says you know Peter and Paul had differences not in their Doctrine but the way Peter was behaving himself they had a little difference in it but it never separated them they were brothers I said oh God help me get to this place amen and things that are to be brother bam makes this statement he says like many kinds of Hills like many kinds of rivers Springs Lakes they were here when you came here first because the kindness of your heavenly father placed them here because some men like mountains some people like Waters some like deserts so you see you're coming he knew your nature and what you would be so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it oh I think that's wonderful uh wonderful father see know that he made it like this I'm glad he made mountains I like mountains and I like that where others oh can't stand oh he must have emptied his mortar box out there well he emptied it out so I could enjoy it you see so they then say I like the plains where I can see a long ways well the two different Natures both of us Christians amen we're not all the same so there's no way in the world we're going to all view everything the same and because we're not going to view everything the same there's going to need to be some forbearing and longsuffering right amen we know that Paul and Barnabas came to a place let's turn there in Acts chapter 15 Act CH 15 and verse 36 in Acts 15:36 he said and the some and some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do and Barnabas determined to take with him John whose surname was Mark but Paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamilia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed aund one from the other and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed into Cyprus and Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God so here if Paul and Barnabas they have a different idea on who should they should take on their next Journey Barnabas wants to take his nephew well of course John Marks his nephew but Paul doesn't want to take him because he left them in pamphilia and he was to take Silas so they separated but we find if you watch the scripture closely there was a Reconciliation at the end because he says into Timothy he said only Luke is with me take mark this same Mark John Mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry oh I love that little nugget that's hidden in the Bible cuz you read this in Acts you think oh that was a separation over Mark but there was a reconciliation somewhere because he realized Mark is profitable to me in the ministry and he was calling amen for Timothy to bring Mark when he comes I'm so glad amen no matter what happens amen by the spirit of God can bring us back together as Brethren brother R says this in super sign say never even had two prophets the same time always an individual men has different ideas cope that together you get a mess God has one man he works with there's one Elijah then Elisha then John on down to Jesus so forth right on down there's Luther Wesley so forth Just Right on down so he says men has different ideas so he only works with one at a time as a major prophet and he says this in the fourth seal said God always deals with one individual two men's got two ideas listen sometimes not two men sometimes is a man and a woman living in the same house can have two ideas two men's got two ideas there never was two Major Prophets on the earth prophesying the same time look back and see if there was no sir too much scrupled up he's got to get one man completely surrendered and use that person I've I've read this I read this for for years I read it many times and even he brings it up in the church age book and in the church age book he says the same thing and he comes down a little farther he says anytime you have a group of people there'll be differences on on on uh not minor points something like that they minor points of major Doctrine though they believe the same Doctrine there'll be differences and and because of this he couldn't have two Major Prophets on the earth at the same time and you think surely two Major Prophets wouldn't do that are you kidding me Jeremiah and Isaiah couldn't come the same time because they had a different view on things is that what Pro is that what brother B saying yeah are you saying Elijah and Moses couldn't be on Earth at the same time back in their Earthly Ministry amen because they would have differences that's what the prophet's teaching us even two Major Prophets couldn't come at the same time because there would be differences so God only worked through one major prophet at a time well my goodness if that's the case with Major Prophets what about you and I we're ripe for it friends we are ripe for differences we're right for misunderstands we're right for different points and minor points and major doctrines even though we believe the same Doctrine we're righte for it but because we're right for it we need to understand that and we need to have forbearance and longsuffering with one another because that's just my brother that's what he sees this is what I see and in reality we both might be seeing it a little wrong but it doesn't matter he's my brother hey amen God help me so I just thought that was amazing when it really hit me I heard brother R say that many times but when the impact of that statement hit me that God couldn't bring Isaiah and Ezekiel the same time why because they would have differences on things and he says men has different ideas cope that together you get a mess praise be to God this shouldn't make it easy for us to to forbear with one another brother M says in questions and answers from 1964 he said now if we took their here this morning in this congregation where people sat here and listen day after day and so forth to the teaching you find out you'd be different one from another because you're different you you make up different your appetites are different you eat different but you all eat food with one individual being just like the other one you're different one from another Christians do the same thing because do all speak with tongues do all prophesy he's showing that even in the body of Christ we have different gifts different administrations of those gifts there's a variety and when brother B says one eat one thing one eat the other in another place he said one likes apple pie and one likes cherry pie but we're both eating pie amen I may have a little I may have a little idea this way and you have a little idea this way but one thing's for sure we love this message amen and we believe it to be the truth and we know that brother Brandon was sent of God to bring us the correct interpretation of the word and I'm still growing in my understanding of that and if I'm growing I can trust that you're growing and if we see it a little different I can forbear with you if you can forbear with me because I I realize now that where I'm standing today is wasn't where I was 5 years ago wasn't where I was a year ago amen I hope it's not where I was 6 months ago but I hope God's constantly unveiling himself to me yeah but you may call it cherry pie I may call it apple pie but we're both eating pie amen I think we need each other more than we realize amen let's go to 1 Corinthians 13 1 Corinthians 13 and good go to verse 4 said charity suffereth long this is this charity is love suffereth long is another another term that's uh used like long suffering it's patience and long patience and long enduring and one of the definitions in the concordance is to be patient and bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be patient so charity suffereth long that means charity is patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish is that the nature of Christ I want that to be my nature charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in Truth beareth All Things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things this word beareth all things also can means to to forbear to suffer to bear and it can mean to bear under a load or to hold up a Lo but it also has another meaning and it means to cover over with silence to keep secret to hide to conceal hides and excuses the errors and faults of others is that what love does yeah is that what charity does is that what Christ charity does for you yeah does he hide and excuse your errors and faults how many want to have charity the Gap Stone of love then we're going to need to suffer long be patient and bearing offenses and injuries of others cuz it's going to come it's going to come because these attributes have to be manifested it's not going to come because you have bad Brethren and you're surrounded by rotten people it's going to come because these things have to be manifested in the body of Christ because these instructions were given to the church so if they're given to the church for how Brethren should deal with each other then there has to be the application of the word meaning there has to be a problem to have the application of the word or else there's no point in Paul writing it amen amen so in instead of instead of uh letting the wheels fall off the bus every time something happen let's keep the wheels on the bus and say hey this is a perfect opportunity for the Life of Christ to mature in me for me to mature into that life say God help me it's so much better I mean it's so much better with a little understanding if we can stop for just a minute if we can stop when the trains are rolling if we could say hold on just a minute let me reflect on what's going on and let me reflect on the inside of me too many times when we when we hit problems we hit conflicts we hit disagreements we hit difficulties we hit circumstances the very first thing we do is start analyzing everybody else in the situation what they said what they did what was right what was wrong and the very last person we analyze is the one we should have started with and that was this guy right here what should my reaction be what did I do did I make it worse can I make it better what can I do what would what would Jesus Christ do what is God asking me to do in this scenario and that's what that brother that brothers and sisters that is what I hope God is teaching us and that's what I hope God is teaching me to stop and there's there's not another person in the world that I can control there's not another person I can fix there's not another person I can make do anything right there's only one person God's asked me to control and he's asked me to possess this vessel amen and so I need to stop and say am I being patient am I being longsuffering am I being forbearing Is This Love or is this Chad and when I stop long enough to do that I I hang my head in shame because most all the time I'm offended and I'm hurt because of me because I want to protect myself I don't want anybody say anything about me I don't want hurt feelings I don't want this and this and this but Jesus was spit on Friends he was stripped naked and made fun of and beat and mocked and laughed and rejected in every way from the people he came to save yeah and I can't bear a misunderstanding with my brother I want to grow friends I want to grow I want to grow I say God I need to grow I admitted I need to grow Lord we need to bear with one another because we're not perfect yet that's right do you believe that I sure believe it we're not perfect yet so we need to bear with one another because we're all growing into the stature of a perfect man we're all striving for the same thing at least we we hope that we are let's turn to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and let's go to verse 14 1 Thessalonians 5:14 says now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are ruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men now this is another commandment for the church and he's telling us to comfort the feeble-minded these are people who are fearful and anxious and nervous not settled support the weak be patient toward all men that means if God wants us to Manifest this then there's got to be once in a while some feeble mindedness Among Us there's got to be some weak there's got to be some need for patience amen remember when when they came to break the alabaster box the woman did anoint Jesus's feet and the disciple says this should have been sold and given to the poor brother Jesus makes a statement he says the poor you will always have but me you not always have so when Jesus said it you can take it to the bank the poor you'll always have there'll always be a need Among Us why because the scripture tells us to take care of one another's needs so how can we keep that scripture unless there's needs that pop up Among Us right so how are we going to keep the scripture unless amen every once in a while we have we have need Amen in our body in ourselves amen a feeble feeble mindedness nervousness anxiety fear amen you can't say well just get over it no that's not what the Bible says Comfort the feeble minded that's our job to comfort one another you say well you should have more faith than that that's not what the Bible says it says Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak support the weak and be patient toward all men say thank God he gave us Commandments to keep man there's other Commandments that we want to keep and there's other Commandments but these are the things that are daily all around us brother brandham in the message the indictment he was speaking early in the indictment just about a sister who was struggling sister Edith Wright I believe is her name she was struggling and he says the human being has two changes in life they have the change from a boy to a man from a woman from a girl to a woman about 6 17 years old they get like a bunch of fly by nights and if you can just suffer with them during that age suffer longsuffering if you can just suffer with them during that age I got a daughter in that age right now Rebecca pray for her and Billy oh every one of us we came through that little frantic age and so we must suffer with them realizing it's something that they have to go through now look at the next one and now edth with just a changing of the seven years every seven years your life changes so the 7even x 7 you see and it makes it kind of hard and that's a complete change he's talking about menopause now and it bothers the women men usually get a kind of funny carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives but women are unfertile after that and we all go through that and we must remember that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things I love this there's things that happen in our life and here he's talking about menopause then he's talking about the the teenagers transitioning and in those early teen years from from childhood to to becoming adults and when they go through puberty they hit a little he said a little frantic spell and what did he say do suffer with them because they're going to get through it just suffer with them what you do for Minos just suffer with them but that only applies when you you know you have your chain of life no there's different things that happen to us friend there's different blows that we take in life there's different things that come our way and what we need is somebody to suffer with us Amen to love us through it amen I need I need somebody to love me through whatever I'm going through if it's if it's menopause if it's change of life if it's whatever it is I need somebody to suffer with me to suffer me to be patient amen we all need one another cuz we haven't haven't come to Perfection yet amen we need each other we need to be patient we need to be forbearing we need to comfort amen we need to not criticize each other every time something goes wrong we need to realize that we're brothers and there's Commandments for Brethren to be longsuffering to be patient to be forbearing I want to throw you my shoulder brothers and sisters when you need it that's the attitude I want because you know what I want I want you to throw your shoulder to me amen amen I want you to help me because I'm not always strong and I'm not always able and I I need your prayer support I want you to have my pray support I want us to love one another Amen brother Bon made this statement and uh is this the sign of the inser he said now all my life since I've been a little boy there's been something that's bothered me and I've had a very odd life and hard to understand even my wife scratches her head and said bill I don't believe there's anybody can understand you and I said I don't understand myself have you ever been in that place when you don't even understand what's going on in your life that you don't even understand why you're feeling the way you're feeling and why you're reacting the way you're reacting but something's going on stress has come to to a point disappointment hurt something's happen you got scared about about something and you know somebody says what's wrong with you and you say I have no idea you know husbands and wives have to do this all the time don't raise your hand but has your spouse ever got in a mood and you don't know why you can't figure it out sometimes they can't figure it out either you know what they need more than anything they need somebody who will suffer with them who will love them anyhow you know to bring him out of that mood faster than anything else brother Bram said he goes I get moody and my wife has to put up with me that's what he said I get moody and my wife has to put up with me I'm glad he said it amen I know none of you other men has ever got Moody but I've gotten Moody before and my wife's had to put up with me but you know when it's all said and done I'm so glad she was patient with me I'm so glad there was somebody who loved me no matter what amen and it makes want to love her no matter what because we're not perfect friends we haven't come to sinless Perfection we haven't got it all figured out we haven't we haven't come to a perfect life where we're never going to make mistake or we're never going to misjudge a situation or we're never going to act wrong or say something wrong that's going to happen how many times do you think that's going to happen I don't know but what we need is to go apply the scriptures and say you know what amen my brother didn't mean it he didn't mean it he doesn't understand he doesn't know let me just bear with him a little while and see if it doesn't work its way out let me just bear with him let me just suffer a little longer and be quiet and be patient for a little bit it'll turn around amen amen sometimes what we don't need is we don't need quick action and quick retribution and jump into something sometimes what we need is just to give it a little time and just cover over it amen and love and be patient and suffer and then see what God will do see if that attitude that idea that concept doesn't just change I don't know about you but I've had ideas that I thought were absolutely right and I remember challenging a minister one time years ago I was just young to the message and I was so on fire and I had read I read the message read my Bible and it was all coming alive and there was a minister and I challenged him on something he said and I quoted a scripture out of this and I said something and boy I was sure I was right and I'm not even going to tell you what it was so don't wait but I was sure I was right but what happened is he was very gracious with me and very patient he said well brother what about this and this and I thought and I stuck to my to my line you know what happened years later I keep thinking about what he said and now here I am that was that was about 20 years ago and here I am and I realize he was right he was right I was wrong you know how I feel now about how gracious he was with me I love that man so much more cuz he saw a young brother who was zealous for the word and I was a little overzealous and I was a little too quick and I was a little too this or that but he was so gracious with me I looked back on that brother and I love him so much cuz I know what he did he could have cut me to Ribbons right but he was just gracious with me amen I don't think we've got it all right today but let's let's forebear one another let's be longsuffering amen let's forgive the way Christ forgave us if Christ could suffer with me all of these years listen I look back on myself just couple years ago just 10 15 years ago I look back and I say I was so immature I missed so much I misunderstood so much I got so things wrong and I had my own ideas mixed in with stuff and I look back and I'm ashamed amen well if God was forbearing with me that whole time and longsuffering with me that whole time why can't I do the same for my brother that's in the same spot today maybe a little immature maybe got the wrong idea maybe just a little too quick on the trigger but why can't I just be patient with him amen and just longsuffering and forbearing I think it would go a long long way friends I look back I thank God that he was bearing me and I want to read one more scripture and I want to end tonight because I don't want to go too late let's we're doing really good on time let's go to Luke chap 12 I intentionally made myself stop studying because I wanted to have a shorter service tonight so Luke chapter 12: 48 Luke 12:48 but he that knew not he that knew not and did commit things worthy of strip shall be beaten with few stripes for unto whosoever much is given of him shall much shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more for whosoever much is given of him shall much be required I believe we've been given much God has given us so much of his word so much of his life so much of his understanding he's given us so much and he's requiring that we live it he's asking us to live it but better than that he's giving us opportunities to live it yeah and we've missed those opportunities I missed I missed I can't tell you how many but I don't want to keep missing the opportunities I want to catch them when they come because he's given me so much he's given me his life his love he's he's he's showed me what he's done for me and how he's bore with me and how he's forgave me and how he's loved me amen and all he's asking me to do is just turn around and give the same out and he's given me opportunities to do that and I see the opportunities as a disaster and a failure and the most horrible thing that ever happened to me but it might not be the most horrible thing that ever happened to me it might be the greatest gift that God ever given me was an opportunity for me to give out what he's given to me because to much is given much is required and much is given much is asked for God has given us if we say God has given us this message he's given us his life he's given us the Holy Ghost he's opened our eyes and opened our standards then God can ask much from us amen because only whom little is given he can only ask little but if he's given you much then he can ask much amen and we claim that he's given us much we he's given us so much he's opened our understanding he's he's revealed himself he's unveiled himself he showed himself if he's done all of that for us and he's given us much then he has the right to ask us for much and he can ask us to die to self he can ask us to surrender our pride he can ask us to forebear and suffer and forgive one another and I think he's got every right to ask for it you know what I want to give that to him I want to surrender myself so he can have that kind of life in me let's all stand musicians if you'll come Jesus was longsuffering with his disciples they were wanting to take the kingdom by force they W want to call fire down from heaven they were wanting to refuse even Jesus to be crucified Peter even took out a sword and tried to kill a man to defend Jesus and and we had the whole wrong idea all together and they wanted to be the greatest in the kingdom and they wanted to argue about it they wanted all kinds of things and he was patient with them because he knew they would eventually get it but you know what brother brandham had to be patient too can you imagine that man seeing the visions that he saw of the unfolding of the Seven Seals and knowing what that knowing what that opening of the seventh seal was and knowing what it was and having to keep quiet and not to explain it and knowing all the Brethren are missing and he and he gets discouraged because nobody's catching it and if you go and watch questions and answers on the seals it's probably the most discouraging moment of his life I can't imagine after what he's preached after the questions that are asked how he discourages this because all week he's saying I hope you're getting it I hope you're catching it I hope I don't have to take it out of my hand and show you I'm just waiting for somebody to jump up and say I see it brother Adam he's waiting at any minute for them to realize the the the magnitude of the event the gravity of what's taking place and in the questions and answers they ask him if it's all right to wear pants P hose and dye their [Music] hair but if you listen to him answer the questions listen how gracious he is how patient how forbearing they're not getting it and at the end he says now I know you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it yeah he come to a realization and and in many ways he was all alone yeah he was all alone he was like Jesus in the midst of the disciples they loved him but they didn't understand Amen brother B was surrounded by people that loved him but didn't understand and got wrong ideas and wrong Concepts and wanted him to do things that were just totally contrary but he was so gracious he was so patient with all of them amen he could have cut them all to ribbons for asking about dying hair wearing this or that but he was patient said oh God help me help me to act like thaten to give my brethren the benefit of the doubt to love them no matter what is there immaturity Among Us yes there's still some immaturity in me if sometimes somebody gets a little overzealous yes that's going to happen maybe sometimes somebody will get the wrong idea absolutely maybe even somebody will make a mistake or say something they shouldn't have said will it happen what a golden opportunity let the word live just let the word live just say you know what it's okay Lord if I heaped up all the things you forgave me for and were patient with me about and I put on a scale what other Brethren have done to me this far outweighs this little bit amen amen let me remember what he's done for me and what he's given to me and when he asks for something back I want to give him back because he's given to me abundantly amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you God for your word and Lord I pray that the instruction that you gave us tonight would hit home Lord that it would hit our hearts and it would become a reality inside of us for God you know who we are and you know the way we take and you know the life we live and God you're giving us opportunities to Shine the Light wherever we go God I pray you help us Lord God I have failed you in this I have failed to get myself out of the way I have failed to surrender I failed to die but God I don't want to fail I want to please you Lord more than I want to please you more today than I did yesterday and tomorrow if there's a tomorrow may I please you more then God I believe you're opening my eyes so that I can see what you want from us today Lord You Want More Than Just Words you want a life you've given us your own life and you've saved us you've redeemed us you've been patient with us Lord God I pray that you would give us that same nature inside of us your nature to be patient and be loving with our Brethren with our families with our children with our spouses may it not Lord be our power we have no power Lord we're weak we have an old Cocker buror nature but God it's you who's living inside of us we're not looking to the flesh man to accomplish this we're looking to your life in the inside we just want to give you more room to work Lord we want to get ourselves out of the way and our ideas and our thinking and we want to surrender it all and strip it all down so that you can come on the scene and you can use us to finish your work God help us I pray God let love rain above all may we suffer one another and bear with one another Lord like we never have before and God I pray that your love would be on display and that Brotherly Love would be on display and perfect love would come on display God I pray you'd start in me May this word of instruction Lord may it go deep inside of us and may it manifest God help us to ruminate on these things and think on them may they become part of our life for it's not preached in vain but it's preached for a purpose and I believe that Lord God I pray that you carry your children safely home we don't know exactly what the weather is like outside but we know there's predictions that I just pray God that you would just drive drive with everybody Lord that you would be in the seat with them that you would take them safely home that you would Compass them about with your angels and protect them along the way God may you bless us as we go along thinking on these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all amen we're not going to have a long song service here at the end so that everybody can be dismissed and go and try not to linger because one of the deacons have to lock up and he'll be the last one out and the last one to drive home and so we want to make sure he can get out too and get home before anything starts amen God bless you all brother Ben He Paid a Debt he did not ow I Ed a debt I could not
