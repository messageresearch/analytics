[0:00] amen now when you see the story of
[0:02] Esther where does your mind go when you
[0:03] think about Ruth cleaning in the field
[0:05] and Ruth laying at boaz's feet and Boaz
[0:07] doing the Kinsmen Redeemer work and
[0:09] coming back and sowing in her a
[0:10] mysterious seed a hidden mysterious
[0:12] seventh portion of seed
[0:15] where do we get that from by the
[0:18] revelation of the open book amen that's
[0:20] where those things come from
[0:23] you don't get it from a surface reading
[0:25] and understanding the Greek words
[0:28] amen amen it's the hidden Mystery that's
[0:31] been hidden in the book amen remember
[0:33] and Junior Jackson's dream there was a
[0:35] great pyramid of stone there and brother
[0:36] Branham there was there was writing all
[0:38] around the stone and he was walking
[0:40] around this Great Pyramid and he was
[0:42] interpreting all the writing on the
[0:43] outside amen that's when the prophet was
[0:46] tying together the Loose Ends all the
[0:48] doctors who the seven Church ages but
[0:50] after he had finished interpreting all
[0:52] the writing on the outside amen there
[0:54] was something inside this rock in this
[0:57] pyramid that no light had ever shined on
[0:59] before amen so he raised his hand in the
[1:02] air he got a sharp instrument peeled the
[1:04] top off said there was White Rock with
[1:06] nothing written on it
[1:09] what is he talking about he's talking
[1:11] about Revelations 10 1-7 where the seven
[1:14] Thunders were never written in the Bible
[1:16] they're all through the Bible but what
[1:18] the seven Thunders uttered was not
[1:20] written Thunder one said this thunder
[1:22] two said that it's a revelation a White
[1:25] Rock that's inside the Bible amen that's
[1:28] never had light shined on before
[1:31] no man-age anointing could ever tell you
[1:34] what those
[1:36] it was going to take a prophet who can
[1:39] get it from God himself and bring it and
[1:42] no amount of teaching will get you to
[1:44] believe that we can get you to
[1:46] intellectually agree with it we can get
[1:48] you to pass the message test on it but
[1:50] there's going to take something
[1:51] Supernatural to drop that into your
[1:53] heart to actually believe that there was
[1:55] a mystery in this whole Bible a white
[1:58] stone laying in the midst of this
[2:00] throughout from Genesis the Revelation
[2:02] that nobody understood no Bible teacher
[2:05] no Bible school until one little Prophet
[2:08] with a seventh grade education come and
[2:10] in a little room the angel comes to him
[2:12] day by day and tells him what John heard
[2:15] but could not write
[2:19] you can say you agree with that but the
[2:21] time is coming when the squeeze will
[2:23] come down we'll find out whether we
[2:24] believe that or not
[2:26] because it can only be received by
[2:28] Revelation not by education
[2:32] we can repeat it back but you go and try
[2:34] to sell that to a theologian
[2:38] he wants to know what what verse was
[2:40] that where did it say that just exactly
[2:42] like that
[2:47] for us we see it everywhere
[2:50] it's all through the Bible
[2:53] this great mystery of the seventh seal
[2:55] it was always there
[2:58] it was Adam
[2:59] and his wife
[3:02] amen it was Boaz and Ruth
[3:04] it was King as an Esther it's been there
[3:07] the whole time
[3:10] we didn't see it
[3:12] until the end time
