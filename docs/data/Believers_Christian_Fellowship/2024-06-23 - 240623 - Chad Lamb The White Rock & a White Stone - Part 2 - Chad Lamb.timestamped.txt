[5:14] forgiven cuz when I touch
[5:20] Jesus he made me
[5:26] whole like the woman who tried
[5:31] [Music]
[5:33] many
[5:37] positions but when she touched
[5:40] [Music]
[5:42] Jesus was healed on that
[5:48] day my sickness was
[5:54] different my sins were so many
[6:00] but when I touched
[6:05] Jesus he washed them
[6:08] [Music]
[6:10] away I pressed through the
[6:16] crowd reached out and touched
[6:21] Jesus the Sweet Holy
[6:27] Spirit came into my
[6:33] soul I knew I'd been
[6:36] [Music]

[7:14] [Music]
[7:17] Cry he's passing by
[7:22] now your needs to
[7:28] supply re Reach Out And Touch
[7:33] Jesus as he passes
[7:38] [Music]
[7:45] by I have a little plaque as I
[7:48] go excuse me as I go in and out of my
[7:51] little house there and it
[7:53] says on the plaque has two little
[7:57] sparrows and it says I I Sing Because
[8:00] I'm
[8:01] happy I sing because I'm
[8:04] free and I was looking in the scriptures
[8:07] brother Bram talks about that about over
[8:09] 50 times but listen what the Bible says
[8:12] it
[8:13] says fear ye not therefore ye are of
[8:16] more value than many
[8:19] sparrows where soever therefore shall
[8:23] confess whosoever shall confess me
[8:24] before men will I confess him also
[8:28] before my Father which is in heaven but
[8:31] whosoever shall deny me before men him
[8:34] will I also deny before my Father which
[8:37] is in heaven think not that I am come to
[8:41] this send excuse me peace on Earth I
[8:44] came not to send peace but a sword and
[8:46] that's misunderstood but all through the
[8:48] trials all through the testing there's
[8:50] one thing that a Believer has the trial
[8:53] of your faith worketh patience so we've
[8:56] all gone through patience because we've
[8:58] all gone through trials and it doesn't
[9:00] look like there's even any possibility
[9:02] that it can end took a little bit of a a
[9:06] fall the other day and
[9:09] uh when I heard the crack I knew what it
[9:12] was pretty well but that didn't stop the
[9:15] pain and I just said well Lord I'm still
[9:17] alive so as I managed to move around and
[9:21] get to the phone
[9:23] and they weren't too happy that I waited
[9:25] about 5 hours but when I finally got a
[9:27] hold of my family I said you better
[9:30] come they call Brother Chad and brother
[9:32] Chad and I have to say this publicly
[9:35] because this is the main reason I'm
[9:36] giving my
[9:38] testimony he went to Sister Sister lamb
[9:42] and said let's agree that when he goes
[9:45] to the hospital and gets x-rays they
[9:47] won't find any
[9:49] breaks that God will heal whatever broke
[9:52] cuz I kept saying I know cuz I've bu
[9:54] busted a lot of Bones through the years
[9:56] and I know when a break is a break so I
[9:59] got there and they went through a
[10:00] battery of X-rays I guessed probably 12
[10:05] and they finally come back and they said
[10:06] we don't know why you're in such pain
[10:08] but we know one thing there's no
[10:15] break I haven't seen you smile that much
[10:18] for a long time you know I'm what I'm
[10:20] fixing to say don't you
[10:23] so the Bible said that not a bone of his
[10:26] would be broken my Lord on the cross
[10:29] thank think of all the nails that went
[10:30] by those tiny little bone fragments or
[10:33] bones in his hand not a bone was broken
[10:37] but he got bruised and I got bruised
[10:39] real bad
[10:41] but so I thought well I laid there
[10:44] through all the tests and whatever and
[10:46] they said well we can't find anything so
[10:49] I went to another doctor because you
[10:52] know how insurance is well you got to
[10:53] make sure you get everybody lined up to
[10:55] check everything and I and he said only
[10:58] thing I can think because it's an MRI uh
[11:01] CT and all these others didn't show
[11:03] anything but I knew in my heart that God
[11:05] had healed me and so I still haven't
[11:08] gotten an MRI by the way that was a
[11:10] month ago and so I started uh thinking
[11:14] about some things that I've been going
[11:17] through like there's people here this
[11:19] morning I know beyond a shadow of a
[11:21] doubt that you're going through tests
[11:22] and
[11:24] trials you're going through some
[11:27] difficult times and you wonder Lord how
[11:29] much
[11:29] longer can I put up with all this stuff
[11:32] remember he'll never put anything
[11:34] greater on you than what you can
[11:36] bear every single thing like a little
[11:39] sparrow that falls he knows it an
[11:42] insignificant little bird like a sparrow
[11:45] he knows it and I'm reminded
[11:48] of how beautiful it is when you step out
[11:52] in
[11:54] faith you know you shouldn't be walking
[11:56] dead I'm not this isn't against my
[11:58] family but but you know you shouldn't be
[12:00] doing anything and I said you know they
[12:02] used to call the old Trappers up in the
[12:04] mountains they get Cabin Fever cuz they
[12:06] couldn't get out because of the snow
[12:08] well there was no snow a lot of rain but
[12:10] no snow but I was getting cabin fever I
[12:12] thought you know if I'm trusting the
[12:13] Lord I've got to trust the Lord but what
[12:16] about the horrible pain you're in ah I
[12:19] don't need those painkillers I don't
[12:20] need those things so I just took a
[12:22] little baby step at a time I'm I'm here
[12:25] to tell you I'm walking on what the
[12:27] doctors say is a broken HP
[12:29] am praise God praise God forever
[12:33] more so I believe the word it isn't the
[12:36] easiest thing to do as far as the
[12:39] natural is concerned but when the
[12:40] spiritual takes over it has nothing to
[12:42] do with the natural because the other is
[12:45] simply just a what
[12:48] symptom he's the Healer you can't see
[12:51] the symptoms in God's economy because
[12:54] faith is a substance that's more real
[12:57] than a broken bone hear me this morning
[13:00] substance is what faith really is it's
[13:02] the real thing as brother Chad's been
[13:04] saying it's the real thing I want to see
[13:07] reality brother sister it's happening
[13:09] today it's happening in our church if
[13:11] you can just go reach out and grab a
[13:13] hold of it God wants to deliver
[13:17] us so as I'm thinking about that I was
[13:20] thinking about about 18 years ago this
[13:22] December
[13:23] 1st I was asked by the brandham family
[13:26] if we would sing at sister Rebecca Brams
[13:28] you've heard this but I want to bring it
[13:30] up this
[13:31] morning it was around the 1st of
[13:34] December uh she was 60 years old and uh
[13:38] that was about 18 years ago a little
[13:39] less than 18 and brother Jim would you
[13:42] sing and it was a private uh funeral
[13:46] just the family few other guests and you
[13:50] know you don't feel
[13:51] worthy uh I never talked to brother
[13:54] brandom but my wife and I were surely
[13:57] close to brother George and sister
[13:58] Rebecca
[14:00] very very close as a matter of fact when
[14:02] she came just before she passed away she
[14:04] came to Phoenix and I was ministering
[14:07] there and afterwards she came and she
[14:09] was crying and she said finally I found
[14:12] a church that my
[14:14] [Music]
[14:15] Daddy has said would be the revelation
[14:18] of this message and finally I'm starting
[14:20] to see what he meant could I be your
[14:23] piano player and I said oh sister
[14:27] absolutely of course phoh like that
[14:29] because she was struggling on the piano
[14:31] anyway she would play the violin but we
[14:33] we were so well first of all we were
[14:35] shocked that she would even say it but
[14:37] as we went on and she stayed there and
[14:39] then you know that she passed away with
[14:41] cancer and we were there with her
[14:43] towards the end and then when brother
[14:45] George said I want you to and your wife
[14:47] to sing that was a great honor for me to
[14:50] sing there with brother Billy Paul
[14:52] Brother Joseph and all the relatives
[14:54] sitting
[14:55] there but while we were singing I know
[14:57] you've heard this before
[14:59] [Music]
[15:00] while we were singing my wife and I and
[15:02] I looked over the brandham family I'm
[15:05] sure just like brother brandham saw his
[15:06] kids there when he was living growing up
[15:10] now
[15:11] older as we're singing this song that
[15:14] I'm going to sing this morning several
[15:16] sparrows came to the window behind me
[15:20] and they started singing their little
[15:21] hearts out they sang so loud I thought
[15:24] the people couldn't even hear us because
[15:26] it bombarded my wife and I from that
[15:28] window window now I I've never seen that
[15:32] before they would fly up to a window
[15:34] that was right behind you and start
[15:36] singing their hearts out and I can't
[15:38] help but say Lord this scripture is
[15:40] fulfilled you are concerned about the
[15:42] sparrow and you just want to bring a
[15:44] witness to how beautiful this song is
[15:46] and when brother brandham said over 50
[15:48] times His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I
[15:53] know he watches over me and you
[15:58] everything could be a lot worse you
[16:00] could had a lot more def de devastating
[16:02] things happen in your life but God is in
[16:04] control of everything brother John he
[16:07] never misses a beat he doesn't care what
[16:10] Satan throws in your pathway he will
[16:12] deliver you you love him this morning
[16:16] amen thank you sister I have to read
[16:19] what brother Bram said and then I'm
[16:20] going to
[16:22] sing he
[16:23] said I can hear him
[16:26] say speaking of the three Hebrew
[16:28] children I watch them all night long
[16:30] Hallelujah for His Eye Is on the Sparrow
[16:33] and I know he watches me he watches you
[16:36] he watches over me yes sir His Eye Is on
[16:40] the Sparrow I Sing Because I'm happy I
[16:43] sing because I'm free for His Eye Is on
[16:46] the Sparrow and I know he watches me and
[16:50] it just dawned on me this morning early
[16:52] real early the reason sister Rebecca and
[16:55] brother George wanted that song she was
[16:58] happy because she was in another land
[17:01] and she was free because she had no pain
[17:03] of cancer anymore so there's an
[17:05] exuberance in The Believer when he has a
[17:07] chance to Worship the Lord no wonder
[17:10] that song meant so much to brother
[17:11] Brandon and it means so much me to me
[17:13] this morning to be able to offer a
[17:15] little bit of encouragement to you so if
[17:18] you're battling things in your life and
[17:20] you think will I ever be delivered just
[17:22] be patient God's got it all in control
[17:25] he's coming along the line he's going to
[17:26] send angels in your neighborhood and
[17:28] maybe it's a goer or maybe it's this or
[17:30] that but he can deliver you in Jesus
[17:34] name God bless you
[17:39] sisters
[17:42] [Music]
[17:46] Hallelujah
[17:48] why should I
[17:51] be
[17:54] [Music]
[17:55] discouraged why
[17:59] should the
[18:00] Shadows Shadows
[18:03] come oh
[18:06] why should my
[18:09] heart ever be
[18:12] lonely and
[18:14] long for
[18:17] heav and
[18:21] home when
[18:25] Jesus
[18:26] is my portion

[29:34] so good to see you right here in the
[29:35] front brother it was a tremendous
[29:38] testimony and as we follow through that
[29:40] testimony with our brother Jim it just
[29:42] became so amazing what God had did and
[29:45] and unless you followed step by step you
[29:47] don't realize what a miracle it is for
[29:49] him to stand here and sing because he
[29:51] was in such excruciating pain after his
[29:53] injury like he said they went and did
[29:55] all the test and could find no break but
[29:57] he was in such such pain he could hardly
[29:59] move I went to visit him and it was
[30:01] horrible it was terrible the pain he was
[30:03] in he had to do a follow-up visit with
[30:05] oio they went and did some more scans
[30:08] and told him the same thing that they
[30:10] come up with different reasons why he
[30:11] was hurting so bad but after he got home
[30:14] they gave him a call and they said
[30:17] actually we found a break it is broke
[30:20] your hip is broke they didn't find it in
[30:22] the hospital they found it at oio and
[30:25] all of a sudden I was confused why they
[30:27] didn't find it we prayed they wouldn't
[30:28] find it they prayed there would be no
[30:29] break they couldn't find it then he goes
[30:31] home and then he calls me and lets me
[30:33] know and and I said oh brother and he
[30:36] says it's okay he said it's okay God's
[30:39] my healer I'm like praise the Lord I
[30:42] said what do you have to do and they
[30:43] said because it's a weekend they
[30:45] couldn't do anything they want me to
[30:46] come in later for an MRI they're going
[30:48] to get some prescription medicine I have
[30:49] to lay completely flat not completely
[30:53] immobile and completely flat sister
[30:55] pharoh was wondering how she was going
[30:56] to get home health aids and n is in
[30:58] there to help him and and all this stuff
[31:00] well I called him a few I no I went to
[31:03] see him a couple days later and I
[31:05] expected brother Jun to be laid out flat
[31:07] not able to move inmobile I walked in
[31:10] his house he's sitting on his couch and
[31:12] as soon as I walked in the door he
[31:13] stands up to come and greet me I said
[31:16] brother what are you doing he said God
[31:17] has healed me
[31:19] brother he said oh IO dropped the ball
[31:22] they didn't order the MRI they didn't
[31:23] get him the pain medicine and he just
[31:24] took it amen as God had healed him and
[31:27] God has certainly healed him and then
[31:30] and then what he told me when I went for
[31:32] that visit he says I know why God didn't
[31:34] allow them to see that he said if they
[31:36] would have found the break when I first
[31:38] went to the emergency room I would have
[31:39] been in the hospital for a week or more
[31:42] laying there flat and God was going to
[31:44] heal me and let me go home so they
[31:46] couldn't see a
[31:47] break God is good friends God is so good
[31:52] amen I'm so thankful that we serve a
[31:55] risen savior amen so I appreciate that
[31:57] testim

[32:02] blessing to serve God and it's a
[32:03] blessing to serve God together with you
[32:06] all man sorry to keep you standing let's
[32:08] let's take our Bibles and look at the
[32:10] Book of Revelation chapter
[32:20] 8 Revelation chapter 8
[32:23] verse1 and when he had opened the
[32:25] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[32:27] about the space of half an hour and God
[32:30] bless you as you have your
[32:32] seats
[32:33] amen want to say God bless you Sister
[32:36] Marty it's good to have you here from

[32:45] visitors from Arizona and we like it
[32:47] amen praise God it's good to see you all
[32:50] and we're going to continue on with the
[32:52] subject I don't know if you remember but
[32:53] we had the uh uh we preached a sermon
[32:55] over two weeks ago called The White Rock
[32:57] Rock and the white stone and we just got
[33:00] super inspired and started preaching and
[33:01] got nowhere near finishing it and so we
[33:05] just got it uh our opportunity to come
[33:06] back today and to pick up where we left
[33:09] off we're going to do just a little bit
[33:10] of review because it was a little over
[33:12] two weeks ago that we ministered on that
[33:14] so we're going to hit the review and
[33:15] then get to the the rest of it and then
[33:18] I once again I've got a a a PowerPoint
[33:20] with the slides so we can go fast I have
[33:23] a lot of slides and I have a lot of uh
[33:25] uh quotes and scriptures and and and I'm
[33:28] not even going to apologize for it amen
[33:30] normally I say I'm sorry but I I don't
[33:32] care I'm so excited I love the word so
[33:34] much I'm so excited just to share what's
[33:37] in my heart that we're just going to
[33:38] take our time this morning it's Sunday
[33:40] morning amen amen let's just take our
[33:43] time and enjoy what God has given us
[33:45] amen this is a special day that we live
[33:48] in and we know that every age has been
[33:49] special but this to me is the special of
[33:52] the special this is the capping off amen
[33:54] and I'm so excited to be alive today and
[33:57] have this Revelation in my heart amen so
[34:01] we read here in Revelations 8 if you'll
[34:03] remember last time we went through and
[34:04] walked through the The Book of
[34:06] Revelation from the church ages to John
[34:08] being caught up to the lamb taking the
[34:10] book and loosing the seals the seals
[34:12] opening in symbol form and brother
[34:14] remember said it was a church form a
[34:15] symbol form they could see the symbol of
[34:17] what it was but they didn't know what
[34:18] the Revelation was and then you come to
[34:21] the the opening of the seventh seal is
[34:23] here chapter 8 verse1 when he opened the
[34:25] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[34:27] about the space of half an hour so now
[34:29] we come to the opening of the six seals
[34:31] in the sixth chapter of Revelations and
[34:33] it's information symbols and things all
[34:36] kinds of stuff to talk about in there
[34:38] but when you come to the seventh seal
[34:40] there's nothing to talk about it's
[34:41] silence it's quiet nothing no moving
[34:44] Parts amen no no images coming out no
[34:47] symbology
[34:48] nothing so thankful for that now let's
[34:51] go over to Revelation chapter
[34:53] 10 and in Revelation chapter 10
[34:57] verse
[34:59] one Revelation 10:1 and I saw another
[35:02] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[35:04] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[35:06] upon his head and his face as it were
[35:08] the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire
[35:11] brother benus said none other than
[35:12] Christ this could be this is Christ The
[35:15] Mighty Angel and he had in his hand a
[35:18] little book open and he set his right
[35:21] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[35:23] the earth now this little book open the
[35:25] prophet of God tells us amen this is the
[35:27] same book that was closed in chapter 5
[35:29] and sealed with Seven Seals now at this
[35:32] coming when the mighty Angel comes down
[35:34] who is Christ and brother Brenham said
[35:36] the seventh angel has to be on earth at
[35:38] the time of this
[35:39] coming so the sealed book it becomes an
[35:43] open book and the mighty Angel descends
[35:45] and brings an open book which is what
[35:47] the seven seal book of redemption now
[35:50] open in the hand of the mighty angel
[35:52] coming down at the time the seventh
[35:55] Church age messenger is on Earth amen
[35:58] so there's no doubts no questions no
[36:00] wiggle room about those things
[36:02] amen and and let's read verse two again
[36:05] and he had in his hand a little book
[36:06] open and he set his right foot upon the
[36:08] sea and his left foot on the earth and
[36:10] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[36:12] lion roared and when he had cried seven
[36:14] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[36:16] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[36:18] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[36:20] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[36:22] up those things which the seven Thunders
[36:24] uttered and write them not now this is
[36:27] such a important verse of scripture and
[36:29] we went through it last time but if
[36:30] you'll just forgive me I want to review
[36:32] cuz I want to encapsulate this whole
[36:33] thought together so just bear with me
[36:35] amen you can say brother Chad you just
[36:37] said that I'm going to say it again and
[36:39] again and again just prepare yourself
[36:41] because this is the day we live in this
[36:43] is the event that has transpired in our
[36:46] day and and so when the mighty Angel
[36:49] descends with an open book in his hand
[36:51] he cries with a loud voice as when a
[36:53] lion roars cuz he is the lion of the
[36:55] tribe of Judah he's the king amen and
[36:57] remember said he's coming now to look
[36:59] for his Queen this is what's transpiring
[37:02] in the end time and the end time seal is
[37:04] the seventh seal and this here is a
[37:07] description of the seventh seal as it
[37:08] opens Revelations 101:7 brother Ram tied
[37:11] that to the seventh
[37:13] seal which he also said was the coming
[37:15] of the
[37:16] Lord
[37:18] amen so now there was a voices the seven
[37:23] Thunders uttered they were voices
[37:25] because John was going to write what the
[37:28] seven Thunders uttered so it was
[37:30] something you could write
[37:31] down we got that so it was a voice it
[37:34] was an explanation it was something amen
[37:37] but he was told to seal it up seal up
[37:40] the the things the seven Thunders
[37:41] uttered and write them not and so now
[37:44] they're sealed up and that sealing is
[37:47] what brother brandham refers to on those
[37:49] seals on the back of the
[37:51] book so if you're listening to brother
[37:53] benam as he's coming down through his
[37:55] ministry he starts talking about now
[37:57] there's seals on the inside of the book
[37:59] and On The Backs side of the book and
[38:01] and then he he he says it different ways
[38:04] you if you follow him through you'll
[38:05] catch he he uses different terminology
[38:07] but he's he's driving at the same thing
[38:09] that there's a set of seals that you can
[38:12] see which were opened when were they
[38:14] opened they were open in the vision of
[38:16] John 2,000 years ago when it opened as a
[38:19] white horse rider and a red horse rider
[38:21] and all the symbology and brother benam
[38:24] saying but there's a set of seals stuck
[38:26] on the back part of the book book amen
[38:28] and and and nobody knows what there are
[38:30] there's nothing written about them
[38:32] there's not even a symbol of that what
[38:34] is he talking about he's talking about
[38:36] the Thunders that were sealed up that's
[38:39] that other set of seals amen that was
[38:43] that oh praise God you don't know for me
[38:47] what it means to see these things so
[38:49] clearly because we probed that and asked
[38:51] God and didn't understand what the
[38:52] prophet said but brother Ben says it's
[38:54] so simple and it is so simple it's one
[38:57] of the simplest things in the scripture
[38:59] amen when brother B saying there was a
[39:01] time in the message people were saying
[39:03] are there 14 seals could there be 14
[39:05] seals because he says seven seals on the
[39:07] inside of the book Seven Seals On The
[39:09] Backs side of the book and it's not 14
[39:11] seals amen it's it's something that
[39:13] opened Amen in a revelation a symbol
[39:16] form but the real revelation of it was
[39:18] still
[39:19] sealed what it all meant what it
[39:21] represented what each symbol represented
[39:24] was still sealed it was sealed till when
[39:26] till the time of the end or the end time
[39:28] or the time of the opening of The Seven
[39:30] seal which is the end time seal and when
[39:32] that Seal's open now will come the
[39:35] revelation of the Seven Seals to explain
[39:38] what it all
[39:41] means that's what he says there's
[39:43] nothing written about it and it ties to
[39:47] the seventh seal because when he opened
[39:49] seventh seal there was
[39:50] silence not a symbol not a sign not
[39:55] nothing so we'll read vers vers four
[39:57] again and when the seven Thunders had
[39:59] uttered their voices I was about to
[40:00] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[40:02] saying unto me seal up those things
[40:04] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[40:05] write them not and the angel which I saw
[40:07] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[40:09] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[40:12] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[40:14] created heaven and the things that
[40:15] therein are and the earth and the things
[40:17] that therein are and the Sea and the
[40:19] things which are therein that there
[40:21] should be time no longer this is why
[40:24] brother M's referring to this as the end
[40:26] time time no longer is the end time seal
[40:28] the ending of all things amen and
[40:31] everything ends he says on this seven
[40:33] seal first it's time no more amen for
[40:35] denominations and time no more for
[40:38] Gentile world power then time no more
[40:40] for this and time no everything finishes
[40:42] out on the seven SEO he said even time
[40:44] finishes on the seven seal and time
[40:46] doesn't finish till the end of the
[40:48] Millennium so everything it's the wrap
[40:51] up It's The End Amen it starts the end
[40:53] of everything praise God now verse seven
[40:57] but in the days of the voice of the
[40:59] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[41:02] sound the mystery of God should be
[41:04] finished as he had declared to his
[41:06] servants the prophets so in the sounding
[41:09] of the seventh angel this mystery of God
[41:13] should be finished praise God now we're
[41:16] going to come down here to a quote I
[41:18] want to
[41:20] read out of the message is this the sign
[41:23] of the ERS and in in the message this is
[41:26] is this the sign of the ERS he preaches
[41:28] this Sunday evening the last Sunday of
[41:30] 1962 which happens to be the next to
[41:32] last day so it's December 30th in the
[41:35] evening of 1962 and he titles the
[41:38] message is this the sign of the answer
[41:39] sir so he starts with a question is this
[41:43] is and and you know we we went through
[41:45] this last time this is the culmination
[41:46] of six dreams and then a vision that he
[41:48] had amen and and now he's got the the
[41:51] word of the Lord to go go west because
[41:53] you got to catch a revelation and come
[41:55] back so now he's going to to go through
[41:57] Junior Jackson's dream which was one of
[41:59] the dreams that came to him in that
[42:01] sequence of six and he says and he came
[42:04] to me and he said something's in my
[42:05] heart I must tell you brother brandom I
[42:06] said go on brother Jackson said I
[42:09] dreamed a dream and there it was I just
[42:11] sat still and I listened and watched
[42:14] said I dreamed that there was a great
[42:15] big hill like out in a field where blueg
[42:17] grass or something was and said up on
[42:19] top of this hill where the water had
[42:21] washed away the soil there was a top
[42:23] rock up on top the hill
[42:25] like uh
[42:28] up on top of the hill
[42:31] like and it was Rock no grass and where
[42:34] the water had washed down and to cup
[42:36] some kind of readings on these stones
[42:38] and you were standing there interpreting
[42:40] this reading on these stones and said
[42:41] all of us and there and here is the way
[42:44] he put it said the Brethren from Jordan
[42:45] from all around we were all standing
[42:47] together listening to interpret that
[42:49] mysterious writing on those stones that
[42:51] mountain said then you picked up
[42:53] something like from the air something
[42:55] like a wrecking bar or a crowbar wasn't
[42:57] it brother something like that A
[42:58] Wrecking Bar real sharp and said how how
[43:01] you done it I don't know said you struck
[43:04] the top of that mountain ripped it
[43:05] around and lifted the cap off of it and
[43:08] was in the shape of a pyramid and you
[43:09] ripped the top of it off now that was
[43:11] months and months before the pyramid
[43:13] message was preached said beneath that
[43:15] was White Stone Granite and you said the
[43:17] Sun or the light has never shined on
[43:19] this before look on this watch this then
[43:22] further down he says and he said look
[43:24] upon this light has never come upon it
[43:27] before and when all of them got up and I
[43:29] told them to watch that and all of them
[43:31] come up to look in so brother takes this
[43:35] in the in the dream he takes a sharp
[43:37] tool and he rips the top off and reveals
[43:40] that there's white granite rock
[43:41] underneath and he said light has never
[43:43] shined on this before but he said while
[43:46] they were looking in he looked out of
[43:47] the corner of eye I believe it was and
[43:49] watched me I slipped off to one side and
[43:52] I started going towards the West toward
[43:53] the setting of the sun coming up a hill
[43:56] going down a hill coming up a hill going
[43:58] down a hill getting smaller and smaller
[43:59] I went all the way out of
[44:02] sight praise God so now this is the
[44:05] dream that brother bams has and and he
[44:07] goes through all six dreams but he
[44:09] really spends a lot of time on this
[44:10] dream and then on the experience he had
[44:12] when he got caught up into the
[44:13] constellation of Angels in the vision uh
[44:16] the week before he preaches this and
[44:18] then he tells about the the the the
[44:20] vision he had where the stones were
[44:22] laying all over his driveway where they
[44:23] were going to tear out his gate he finds
[44:25] out that was time for that that's the
[44:27] time marker for him to go out west
[44:28] everything comes together he preaches it
[44:30] in this message and then he leaves
[44:32] immediately after this to go out west
[44:34] and that starts a whole another cycle of
[44:36] events that leads to him coming back in
[44:38] March and preaching the Seven
[44:40] Seals so all this all of this comes
[44:42] together so we just want to keep in
[44:43] sequence as we move down
[44:46] through now he continues on in is this
[44:51] the sign of the answer and then notice
[44:53] in some mysterious way we picked up out
[44:55] of the air a sharp tool that opened up
[44:56] the the top and in there was white
[44:58] granite but it wasn't interpreted there
[45:00] was no letters I didn't interpret that
[45:02] Junior I just looked at it and said to
[45:05] the Brethren look on this and that's
[45:06] fulfilled
[45:08] tonight so the dream was fulfilled right
[45:11] there and so there's listen don't ever
[45:14] think that there's a future fulfillment
[45:16] of Junior Jackson's dream brother bam
[45:18] said it was fulfilled right then and
[45:20] then the last part of the dream they saw
[45:22] brother bam going out west that was
[45:24] fulfilled the next or two days later
[45:26] when he got in the station wagon and
[45:28] drove out west and moved out west amen
[45:30] so the dream was
[45:32] fulfilled amen what what did he do oh
[45:35] praise God let's just keep going I don't
[45:38] want to get ahead so we know he goes out
[45:40] west and he goes out west he connects
[45:42] with this constellation of angels this
[45:43] was the picture that was tooken and
[45:45] became becomes the sign of what brother
[45:46] Ben's talking about there was a
[45:48] representation in the Heavens to show us
[45:50] amen that there's a Capstone coming down
[45:53] in the pyramid for it's a Capstone and
[45:55] the Capstone is made of the wings of
[45:58] seven angels amen and and the Seven
[46:00] Angels brother said represented the
[46:01] church ages
[46:03] complete it's the complete New Testament
[46:05] it's the completion of the church ages
[46:07] now the capping off of the Church of the
[46:10] New Testament is coming down Amen
[46:12] brother b gets caught into this
[46:13] constellation amen and and it's amazing
[46:15] that it's a clown it's amazing it's
[46:17] white because it was White Rock that was
[46:19] under the stone and white represents
[46:21] Purity and he said there is nothing
[46:23] written on it it's a pure Revelation
[46:25] that light is never shine never been
[46:27] illuminated it's not not one word he
[46:29] said written about it in the Bible amen
[46:31] so it cannot be tampered with tainted
[46:34] manipulated messed up by the ideas of
[46:36] man it was kept totally secret to the
[46:38] end time so that it wouldn't be all
[46:40] messed up so that our thinking would
[46:43] already be messed up about this amen he
[46:45] says when it's in the Bible men probe at
[46:47] it and poke at it and they do all these
[46:49] other things but there's not one word
[46:51] written why light has never shined on
[46:53] this before and brother B said I've read
[46:55] all these books and don't even know that
[46:57] there's Seven Seals yet to be
[47:00] revealed what's he looking at he's
[47:02] looking at the Thunders what's he doing
[47:04] he's preaching it and s s is this the
[47:07] sign of the end Ser he's preaching it
[47:09] there he's letting you know that in this
[47:12] Bible is a mystery within this Bible
[47:15] underneath the rock which represents the
[47:17] Bible because remember it had writings
[47:19] all around it he was going around
[47:20] interpreting all the writings what was
[47:22] his ministry to this point to tie
[47:24] together all the Loose Ends from the
[47:26] church ages that have been left off and
[47:28] misunderstood and he was taking the
[47:30] scriptures and he was correcting the
[47:32] doctrine of the Apostles and bringing us
[47:34] back to the teaching of the Apostles he
[47:37] preached what Paul preached so he
[47:38] interpreted the writing on the outside
[47:40] of the
[47:43] rock then he comes to this point and
[47:45] says now there's something that's not
[47:48] even written there's something with in
[47:51] this Revelation within this mountain of
[47:53] the word that light has never shined on
[47:56] before before nobody's looked on this
[47:58] and now in the vision he takes the cap
[48:02] off and shows you there's a there's a
[48:05] rock within the rock there's a
[48:06] revelation inside the
[48:08] word and nobody knew that till that
[48:11] point and then he tells them you look on
[48:13] this I'm going out west they were
[48:15] looking what were they looking at they
[48:17] were looking at what brother brandham
[48:18] had just exposed in this message he
[48:21] exposed the fact that there's got to
[48:23] come a revelation of this that was
[48:25] sealed up till the end time cuz Daniel
[48:27] was told that it'll be sealed until the
[48:28] end time so that means at the end time
[48:32] what was sealed has to be unsealed
[48:34] because it was sealed until the time of
[48:36] the end so the time of the end would be
[48:38] the time of the unsealing what's going
[48:40] to be unsealed the one thing in the
[48:42] Bible that there's not a word written
[48:44] about and it's those seven
[48:47] Thunders lights never shine on this in
[48:50] that message he's telling them to look
[48:52] on this amen so he can go out west and
[48:55] and then and so they were just there to
[48:57] what to look on the fact that there's
[48:59] got to come another revelation of this
[49:01] yes not to figure it out cuz there's
[49:03] nothing written they can't figure
[49:04] anything out they can't read anything
[49:08] all they can read is verse four which
[49:10] tells him he sealed up the things that
[49:12] were
[49:13] uttered praise
[49:15] God so then he goes out west he connects
[49:19] with the angels when he gets caught up
[49:20] into the consolation of angels they tell
[49:22] him go back East for the revelation of
[49:25] the Seven Seals
[49:30] in in the same message time shall be no
[49:32] more he announces that time is over what
[49:35] happens what happens could that be so
[49:37] now Brethren seriously think if it is
[49:41] then the pyramid is capped by the seven
[49:45] Thunders this is so
[49:48] critical what is this it's the Capstone
[49:52] it's The Headstone it's the headship of
[49:55] Christ coming down to cap off his bride
[49:58] hallu what caps off the church those
[50:02] seven
[50:03] Thunders he ties it all
[50:06] together you remember the pyramid
[50:08] message it's the Capstone what did it do
[50:10] the Holy Spirit capped off when he says
[50:12] the pyramid message he's going back to
[50:14] stature of a perfect man showing that
[50:16] through faith love Temperance or faith
[50:19] Temperance whatever I I don't even have
[50:20] it right now I'm not even going to try
[50:22] amen bring building up to the stature of
[50:24] a perfect man but the headship is love
[50:26] the eighth is the capping off which is
[50:28] love which is
[50:30] God and so he's tying this together with
[50:33] the pyramid message which is Statue of a
[50:35] perfect man and he says what did it do
[50:36] the Holy Spirit capped off the
[50:38] individual and seal it when we added to
[50:40] our faith righteousness godliness and
[50:42] faith and so forth and kept adding it
[50:44] till we got seven things and the seventh
[50:46] one was love which is God that's how we
[50:48] makes the individual and caps him and
[50:50] seals him with the Holy Spirit then if
[50:53] that be so he's got seven Church ages
[50:56] that he's had seven Mysteries that's
[50:58] been sounded away and they fought for to
[51:00] bring back and now the headstone comes
[51:03] to cap off the church does the Thunders
[51:06] mean that my brethren sir is that where
[51:09] we're at I remember that I said in this
[51:12] message it's all questions is this the
[51:14] sign of the end sir sir is this where
[51:16] we're at is that what the Thunders mean
[51:18] is this the time for this to be
[51:20] fulfilled it's all questions but if you
[51:22] follow the message through when brother
[51:23] brandham comes to the seven seal it's no
[51:26] longer a question to him he knows that
[51:29] it is the sign of the end and it is the
[51:31] end time and it's the and and it's the
[51:32] opening of the seventh seal he knows it
[51:35] before he's asking questions but after
[51:37] he says it
[51:39] is
[51:42] amen now look at the title God hiding
[51:45] himself in Simplicity Albuquerque New
[51:47] Mexico this is 3 weeks after he preaches
[51:51] the seals this is not during the seals
[51:53] so he starts the seal week off preaching
[51:55] God hiding himself in Simplicity and
[51:57] revealing himself in the same but this
[51:58] is after that not before he says
[52:01] something happened the other day you
[52:03] read or heard the tape the seven
[52:06] Thunders what time is it
[52:11] siru brother branom just called the tape
[52:14] what time is it sir the seven Thunders
[52:17] what was he preaching the seven Thunders
[52:19] what was he showing there's got to come
[52:21] a revelation of these seven Thunders
[52:23] this is the mystery under the capping
[52:26] this this is the Min this is what caps
[52:28] off the New Testament this is what
[52:29] finishes the word this is what completes
[52:31] the bride this is what brings Christ
[52:33] down to unite with his bride this is the
[52:36] opening of the seventh seal amen This is
[52:38] the End Time message this is the end
[52:40] time and the revealing of of the
[52:42] Mysteries this it's it's all here and he
[52:45] and he comes and he says have you heard
[52:46] the tape the seven Thunders go find the
[52:49] tape titled seven th he tells you which
[52:51] one it is what time is it sir so what
[52:54] time is it sir is the seven th thers
[52:56] that's where brother Brandon preached
[52:58] letting you know there's got to come a
[53:00] revelation of these Thunders and he says
[53:02] is it time for those Thunders if it is
[53:04] the Thunders will cap off the church
[53:06] amen is it is that what this is for is
[53:08] I'm supposed to go out there to get the
[53:10] revelation of these seven Thunders it's
[53:11] all about the seven
[53:15] Thunders so what does he do he goes out
[53:18] west why because the question is the
[53:21] seven Thunders yes what is it nothing's
[53:24] written it's mysterious it's a white
[53:26] Rock not one word written completely
[53:29] silent sealed up till the time of the
[53:32] end he goes out west Amen to to to what
[53:36] because the question is is this the
[53:38] seven Thunders is it time for the seven
[53:40] Thunders to be revealed is it time for
[53:42] those seals on the back part of the book
[53:43] to come open that's his question he goes
[53:47] out west amen we talked about this
[53:49] before God puts the sword in his hand
[53:50] which is the word coming to the hand of
[53:52] the Prophet amen then he gets caught up
[53:53] in the consolation of angels then he
[53:55] gets sent back and he he he goes out for
[53:58] the mystery of the
[54:00] Thunders and he comes back preaching the
[54:03] Seven
[54:09] Seals where' the Thunders
[54:16] go are you
[54:18] following goes out to get the revelation
[54:22] of the seven Thunders and he comes back
[54:26] preaching ing the revelation of the
[54:27] Seven
[54:28] Seals so maybe the revelation of the
[54:30] Seven Seals is the seven
[54:36] Thunders praise be to
[54:39] God now we're in the seventh
[54:43] seal now notice now that now when this
[54:46] taken place Junior was standing in a
[54:48] field had a big pyramid he's going right
[54:50] back listen he went through this dream
[54:52] in detail when he goes out west when he
[54:55] preaches at the end of 1962 now he's
[54:58] back here 3 months later amen and he's
[55:00] preaching in March and and now he's in
[55:02] the seventh he's at all eight days of
[55:04] preaching he's come to the 10th service
[55:06] he's at the last one in the evening
[55:07] service on Sunday preaching and he goes
[55:09] right back to Junior Jackson's dream
[55:11] says now this taking place Junior was
[55:13] standing in the field had a big pyramid
[55:15] to it like that and there was something
[55:16] wrote on the rocks and I was revealing
[55:18] that to the people is that right Junior
[55:20] about a year before it happened now
[55:22] notice the next thing now I took some
[55:24] kind of a bar cut it off on the inside
[55:26] side was the White Rock that had nothing
[55:27] roote on it and at that time I started
[55:30] to the west and told them all said don't
[55:32] go out west stay here and look on this
[55:33] till I return went West for the blast
[55:37] returned back to the east with the Holy
[55:38] Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word
[55:42] what Unwritten word the seven Thunders
[55:45] that John heard and was told to write
[55:47] and was told to seal up that's the
[55:49] unwritten
[55:51] word and he went out to get the to hear
[55:54] the blast to connect with the angels the
[55:55] holy ghost bringing him back East to
[55:58] what to interpret the unwritten word how
[56:01] did he interpret the unwritten word what
[56:03] did he call that series that he preached
[56:05] when he interpreted the Thunders the
[56:07] unwritten word he called it the
[56:09] preaching of the Seven
[56:13] Seals
[56:15] amen he said now if that isn't perfectly
[56:18] the God Almighty I want you to know what
[56:20] is what am I trying to say this for
[56:23] friends is to show you we at the end
[56:29] time Daniel was told go thy Way Daniel
[56:32] for the prophecy the vision is sealed up
[56:35] till the time of the end when will it be
[56:37] unsealed the time of the end brother
[56:39] benam is saying I'm here to tell you
[56:42] this is the time this is we're at the
[56:44] end time what end time when that Mighty
[56:47] Angel come down with an open book in his
[56:49] hand and the revelation of the seven
[56:51] Thunders and cried with a loud voice and
[56:53] said time shall be no longer what is it
[56:55] it's the the seventh seal It's The End
[56:58] Time
[57:02] seal we're at the end time no question
[57:05] friends we're at the end time I used to
[57:09] think listen I I used to think brother
[57:11] Brenham didn't say anything in the
[57:12] seventh seal now I go back and read and
[57:15] he said it all in the seventh seal he
[57:18] gave the full Revelation in the seventh
[57:20] seal amen it's all laying there he told
[57:24] you he told everything that he was
[57:26] allowed to
[57:27] tell it's all there he tells you it's at
[57:30] the end time he tells you he went and
[57:32] got the interpretation of the written
[57:34] word he tells you he came back and
[57:36] preached it he tells you all of it
[57:39] yes look at what he says get in seven
[57:42] seal when will it be brotherr I brother
[57:45] BR I cannot tell you I do not know but
[57:47] one of these days if we never meet again
[57:49] on this Earth We're going to meet Yonder
[57:50] at the Judgment seat of Christ and
[57:52] you'll find out in that room the
[57:54] Revelation coming from God just like the
[57:56] rest of them has that one of the mystery
[57:58] of that seal the reason it wasn't
[58:01] revealed it was seven Thunders that
[58:03] uttered their voices and there it is
[58:05] perfectly because nothing knows anything
[58:07] about it wasn't even written so we're at
[58:10] the end time we are
[58:16] here praise God and you know when
[58:19] brother M comes to the seventh seal he
[58:21] sees it unfold in three unfoldings amen
[58:24] and one of them happened the other day
[58:26] one today and one was in unknown tongues
[58:28] he couldn't make it out and so you know
[58:31] what I believe to me there's still
[58:33] mysteries in the seventh seal there's
[58:35] still things we don't know about the
[58:37] seventh seal to say the seventh seal is
[58:39] open amen you can say well what all is
[58:41] entailed in the seventh seal well I know
[58:43] this part one of the Mysteries so one of
[58:46] the mysteries of that seal what seal the
[58:49] seventh seal so the seventh seal has
[58:51] more than one
[58:54] mystery one of the mystery of that
[58:59] seal so it means the seven seal is not
[59:01] simplistic it's not just knowing one
[59:05] thing one of the mystery of that seal
[59:08] the reason it wasn't revealed it was
[59:10] seven Thunders that utter their voices
[59:12] one part of that mystery of that seal
[59:14] amen that lets you know that the seal is
[59:16] open is the revelation of the seven
[59:19] Thunders which were contained in it was
[59:21] the revelation of the Seven Seals the
[59:23] unwritten word amen that lets you know
[59:25] that one mystery under that seal has
[59:28] been opened so the seventh seal is
[59:31] open listen if the seventh seal is the
[59:33] coming of the Lord it encompasses so
[59:35] many things amen you've got the if
[59:37] you've got the coming of the Lord You've
[59:39] Got The Return of the full revelation of
[59:41] Jesus Christ the full mystery of God has
[59:43] to return the headship has to come down
[59:46] the invisible Union has to take place
[59:48] amen the bride has to be impregnated and
[59:50] bring forth Christ again upon the Earth
[59:52] then she's got to be carried away amen
[59:54] her atoms have to change she has to to
[59:56] go in a translation then he has to
[59:58] return through two prophets and reveal
[1:00:00] himself to 144,000 then he's got to
[1:00:02] destroy everybody on the battlefield and
[1:00:03] the Battle of armagedon and then again
[1:00:05] he comes back to set up the millennial
[1:00:07] Kingdom the coming of the Lord has a lot
[1:00:10] to it friends and some of it's still
[1:00:13] mysterious because we don't know exactly
[1:00:16] how things will happen we don't exactly
[1:00:18] know when things will happen we just
[1:00:20] know what this seven seal is and that
[1:00:22] it's
[1:00:23] open so we're not in any way trying to
[1:00:26] say it's simplistic oh it's this it's
[1:00:28] easy there's a lot to it friends when
[1:00:30] Jesus came the first time in the first
[1:00:32] coming it encompasses so many things so
[1:00:34] many details amen when he came there was
[1:00:37] prophecies being fulfilled there was a
[1:00:39] movement of Nations there was a census
[1:00:41] that took place there was an
[1:00:42] impregnation of a virgin a virgin womb
[1:00:44] according to Isaiah 7 there was a
[1:00:47] Nazareth location then a moving to
[1:00:48] Bethlehem then the ends being full and
[1:00:51] there was wise men that came there was a
[1:00:53] Herod trying to kill all the young then
[1:00:55] there was Jesus debating in the temple
[1:00:57] when he's 12 years old the growing up of
[1:00:59] Jesus Christ then there was his ining
[1:01:01] his Earthly Ministry signs and wonders
[1:01:03] and miracles amen then there was the
[1:01:05] rejection of the nation I mean it was
[1:01:07] full of
[1:01:09] stuff that was the first
[1:01:12] coming and we treat the second coming
[1:01:14] like it's just going to be one little
[1:01:16] simple
[1:01:18] thing
[1:01:21] amen but one of the mystery of the seal
[1:01:24] the reason it wasn't Reve revealed it
[1:01:26] was seven Thunders that uttered their
[1:01:29] voices and there it is perfectly because
[1:01:31] nothing knows anything about it wasn't
[1:01:34] even written so we're at the end time we
[1:01:38] are here you realize brother B's not
[1:01:40] saying it's getting close to the end
[1:01:42] time or this will happen in the end time
[1:01:44] he's saying this is the end
[1:01:49] time again in s said do you notice when
[1:01:52] the Jews asked him that you know when we
[1:01:54] compared the scripture here with Matthew
[1:01:56] 24 with the six seals the seven seal was
[1:01:58] left out because you see Christ said
[1:02:00] only God himself knowed not even the
[1:02:02] angels no wonder it was it even written
[1:02:04] you see they hush nothing taking place
[1:02:06] then Angels don't know it nobody knows
[1:02:09] when he's
[1:02:10] coming what is he talking about the
[1:02:12] seventh seal that's the part that was
[1:02:14] left out of Matthew 24 yeah nobody knows
[1:02:18] when he's
[1:02:18] coming but there will be seven voices of
[1:02:23] the Thunders that will reveal the great
[1:02:24] Revelation at that time what great
[1:02:27] Revelation the revelation of his coming
[1:02:29] the opening of the seventh seal it will
[1:02:31] be revealed at the at the Thunders the
[1:02:35] the the seven voices of those Thunders
[1:02:37] will reveal the great Revelation at that
[1:02:39] time so I believe to us if we don't know
[1:02:42] it if we we it won't be known till that
[1:02:45] time but it will be revealed in that day
[1:02:49] in The Hour That is supposed to be
[1:02:50] revealed
[1:02:51] in why is brother bah haltering around
[1:02:54] so much on this because he himself knows
[1:02:56] exactly what it
[1:02:58] is we're going to get to this in a
[1:03:01] minute so the thing for us to do is to
[1:03:03] be reverent before God and serve him and
[1:03:06] do all that we know how to do and live
[1:03:08] good Christian lives here now we find
[1:03:10] that the six seal has opened to us we
[1:03:12] see it and we know that the seventh seal
[1:03:15] cannot be broke to the public until that
[1:03:17] hour arrives key word there is
[1:03:20] public now there was some reason that
[1:03:23] God let the seven voices be thundered
[1:03:25] because must come for we find that
[1:03:27] Christ the lamb took the book in his
[1:03:30] hand and he opened the seventh
[1:03:33] seal but you see it's a hidden Mystery
[1:03:36] so when you opened the seventh seal it
[1:03:38] was a hidden mystery no one knew it but
[1:03:41] it it's right along with what he said no
[1:03:44] one would know his coming they also
[1:03:47] would not know about this seventh
[1:03:48] Thunder mystery so you see it's
[1:03:51] connected together so what is connected
[1:03:55] the seventh seal the coming of the Lord
[1:03:56] is connected with the seven seal
[1:04:01] mystery the seven voices of the seven
[1:04:03] Thunders will reveal the great
[1:04:05] Revelation at that
[1:04:06] time and we are here it's the end time
[1:04:11] brother R can't come right out and say
[1:04:12] it he's told not to in the third pool
[1:04:13] you won't explain this like the other
[1:04:15] ones when it starts it'll be a total
[1:04:16] secret but he does everything he can to
[1:04:19] get you to see
[1:04:20] it and we missed it and missed it I
[1:04:23] missed it and missed it and missed it
[1:04:25] and missed missed it and missed it and
[1:04:26] missed it then all the day one day it
[1:04:28] was like fireworks going off poof there
[1:04:30] it
[1:04:31] was this is why brother B said don't try
[1:04:33] to interpret anything just live a simple
[1:04:35] Christian humble life you'll get
[1:04:36] yourself way moved away from it if we
[1:04:38] try listen the the the revelation of the
[1:04:41] seven Thunders the opening of the
[1:04:43] seventh seal was so simple that's why he
[1:04:45] started with God hiding himself in
[1:04:47] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:04:49] same amen the reason he starts with that
[1:04:51] message and then he comes to the seventh
[1:04:53] seal says how did I know a week ago amen
[1:04:56] that that is so simple so humble and he
[1:04:58] tells us you just don't try to interpret
[1:05:01] anything if God wants you to know
[1:05:02] something he'll reveal it to you just
[1:05:04] stay simple and humble and live a
[1:05:05] Christian Life if you try to interpret
[1:05:07] you'll wind yourself that much farther
[1:05:09] away from it why because it's so simple
[1:05:12] if you try to figure this out you're
[1:05:14] going to do nothing but mess up what the
[1:05:16] opening of The Seven seal is because it
[1:05:18] was so simple it was taking place all
[1:05:21] week and nobody there knew it that's how
[1:05:23] simple it was yes
[1:05:27] the evidence of the opening of The Seven
[1:05:28] seal was manifesting right before their
[1:05:31] eyes and brother M talks about that I
[1:05:34] think we're going to get into that right
[1:05:35] now I I mentioned it to you last time
[1:05:37] but I went and pulled some quotes and I
[1:05:39] I didn't get them all because I didn't
[1:05:41] have time to read through everything but
[1:05:42] if you find some more along this line
[1:05:44] send them to me so out of the week he's
[1:05:46] preaching the seals brother Brandon
[1:05:48] makes several statements and here in the
[1:05:51] first one God hiding himself in
[1:05:52] Simplicity says now if you're Wide Awake
[1:05:55] you'll see something I hope I don't have
[1:05:58] to hold it in my hand to show you see
[1:06:02] it's it's here we're at the end yes sir
[1:06:07] smart education will miss it the simple
[1:06:10] Visions when they're revealed in such
[1:06:11] Simplicity till it just crosses over the
[1:06:14] top of people's
[1:06:15] head what will cause it to cross over
[1:06:18] head when we think too
[1:06:21] hard because it is Mega simple super
[1:06:26] duper simple so simple nobody that was
[1:06:31] present when it was happening knew it
[1:06:33] was happening except the man who was
[1:06:36] preaching amen and it was that
[1:06:41] simple all right so this is the first
[1:06:44] message then we come to the second seal
[1:06:46] he says but in the last days of the
[1:06:48] sounding Revelation
[1:06:50] 101:7 said the mystery of God would be
[1:06:52] finished in the last days at the
[1:06:54] sounding of the seventh Angel Malachi 4
[1:06:57] said that he would send Elijah before
[1:06:58] that evil Day come upon the earth when
[1:07:00] he'd burn it like a furnace and he would
[1:07:02] restore and to bring back the children
[1:07:04] to the faith of the fathers the original
[1:07:07] Apostolic Pentecostal Faith which he
[1:07:09] promised to be restored now that's just
[1:07:12] as plain as scripture can say it now
[1:07:14] it's promised and if we're in the last
[1:07:16] days something's got to happen and it's
[1:07:19] happening and we're seeing
[1:07:23] it he's in the second seal it had
[1:07:27] already
[1:07:28] begun the day before in the first seal
[1:07:32] he told us what was going to happen in
[1:07:33] the breach then he comes in the first
[1:07:35] seal and he starts it and he says if
[1:07:38] we're in the last days something's got
[1:07:39] to happen so if we're in the last days
[1:07:42] something's got to happen what's got to
[1:07:44] happen in the last days well there's got
[1:07:46] to be a big miracle thing and there's
[1:07:47] got to be some big no what's got to
[1:07:49] happen in the last day is the mystery
[1:07:51] that's been sealed has to be unsealed
[1:07:53] the seven Thunder mystery has to be
[1:07:55] revealed that's what's got to happen in
[1:07:56] the last day that's what he's been
[1:07:58] talking about the whole time everything
[1:08:00] brother Brenham leads up to this message
[1:08:03] when he comes to this he's leading up
[1:08:05] with those seven Thunders the White Rock
[1:08:07] the mystery nobody knows silence in
[1:08:09] heaven the coming of the Lord the the
[1:08:11] the the Mysteries under the seven
[1:08:13] Thunders that's everything like if you
[1:08:15] followed his ministry till you get to
[1:08:17] this place and you're in brandham
[1:08:18] Tabernacle you come to this place this
[1:08:20] is everything he's laying down to prep
[1:08:22] you to this and he says if we're at in
[1:08:24] the last days something's got to happen
[1:08:26] he's been telling them what has to
[1:08:28] happen what has to happen is those seals
[1:08:30] on the back part of the book have to
[1:08:32] come
[1:08:33] off that's what marks the end time
[1:08:36] that's been waiting for the end time for
[1:08:38] to be unsealed so we're at the end time
[1:08:40] something's got to happen and it's
[1:08:44] happening and we're seeing
[1:08:47] it praise God Amen I
[1:08:50] wasn't but by the grace of God I'm
[1:08:53] seeing it
[1:08:54] now amen be third seal but this morning
[1:08:59] early the Holy Spirit came to where I
[1:09:00] was just as plain as anything I seen
[1:09:03] this other seal open now just exactly
[1:09:06] now now now he hears me I know and I'm
[1:09:08] very grateful now you'll just remember
[1:09:10] that there is something happening that I
[1:09:13] hope you're catching
[1:09:15] it there's something happening I just
[1:09:18] want to test the church one time and see
[1:09:20] if they could actually pick up something
[1:09:21] before it actually taken place now
[1:09:23] remember remember that I've told
[1:09:25] remember what I've told you and may the
[1:09:27] Lord help
[1:09:30] us that's he's saying I like I said
[1:09:33] before I couldn't imagine sitting there
[1:09:35] that day hearing those things and
[1:09:36] straining like crazy to try to remember
[1:09:39] what did he tell he's told us all kinds
[1:09:40] of stuff what he talking about remember
[1:09:42] what I told you and he's talking about
[1:09:43] remember what I told you and serves as
[1:09:45] this the time remember what I came back
[1:09:47] and said in God hiding himself in
[1:09:48] Simplicity then the breach I he's been
[1:09:50] telling them the same thing all along
[1:09:52] that there's these seals that have to be
[1:09:54] open the Thunders had to be revealed the
[1:09:56] unwritten word the White Rock the
[1:09:58] mystery that that Daniel couldn't see

[1:10:14] catching I hope you're catching
[1:10:16] it there's something happening it was
[1:10:19] happening right

[1:10:38] there many other things if you caught it
[1:10:41] I'm waiting for my questions to see by
[1:10:44] all right this is interesting because
[1:10:46] when he comes to the fifth seal up until
[1:10:48] this day he's been saying that that when
[1:10:50] we get to Sunday Sunday morning which
[1:10:53] will be the The Eighth Day when we get
[1:10:55] to Sunday morning in these meetings
[1:10:57] we're going to have a prayer for the
[1:10:58] sick we're going to have a prayer line
[1:10:59] and prayer for the sick and he's
[1:11:01] announcing it all the way through but he
[1:11:02] changes his mind and he says no I think
[1:11:05] we're going to do questions and answers
[1:11:07] and then maybe pray for the sick so he
[1:11:09] changes his agenda from what he had in
[1:11:11] the beginning and look at what
[1:11:14] he I'm just going to tell you what I
[1:11:16] think so take it for what it's worth
[1:11:18] this is just what I think he says many
[1:11:22] other things have you caught it I'm
[1:11:24] waiting for my question to see
[1:11:26] by what's he trying to see he's trying
[1:11:29] to see by the questions you ask if you
[1:11:30] caught it he's wanting to know what the
[1:11:33] people are getting and you know what he
[1:11:34] got can I wear deodorant is it all right
[1:11:36] to to wear panty it was going right over
[1:11:39] their heads they weren't they were
[1:11:40] missing completely the event that was
[1:11:42] taking place before their very eyes and
[1:11:44] he says something's going on at the end
[1:11:45] time and this has got to happen and it's
[1:11:47] happening and we see it it's happening I
[1:11:49] hope you can catch it remember what I
[1:11:52] told you and Lord help us I'm testing
[1:11:54] the church to see if they can catch
[1:11:55] something before it actually happens and
[1:11:57] then he comes to the fifth seal and he
[1:11:59] says that the fifth seal has opened
[1:12:02] there what was the opening of the fal
[1:12:05] explaining the souls that are under the
[1:12:06] altar showing what happened for the
[1:12:07] Redemption of the Jews from the time of
[1:12:09] Christ
[1:12:10] on he says the fifth seal is open there
[1:12:14] many other things if you caught
[1:12:16] it I'm waiting for my questions to see
[1:12:19] by all right that's important you catch
[1:12:22] that this is where he's saying we're
[1:12:23] going to have questions and answers and
[1:12:24] now he's telling you I'm waiting for the
[1:12:25] questions to see what you've
[1:12:29] caught Sixth Seal now remember
[1:12:33] friends these are not my ideas of this
[1:12:37] this is not what I've been thinking this
[1:12:39] is all together from me so help me the
[1:12:41] Holy Spirit knows
[1:12:43] it you wait if the Lord willing tomorrow
[1:12:46] night what night is the end this is

[1:12:51] morning he's having questions and
[1:12:52] answers in the evening he's preaching
[1:12:53] the seventh seal
[1:12:55] he said tomorrow night I want to show
[1:12:57] you a mystery that's been going all the
[1:13:00] time right here in this meeting I doubt
[1:13:03] very much whether you've ever seen it or
[1:13:05] not what's what's took place it's been
[1:13:08] something that's laid right here before
[1:13:10] you and I've watched each night for for
[1:13:13] it to rise or somebody to say I see
[1:13:17] it what's he talking
[1:13:20] about what is he what's he what's he
[1:13:23] been what's he been waiting for somebody
[1:13:24] to say say I see it brother B I see it
[1:13:26] and he's trying to get him to see it and
[1:13:28] he keeps referring to it and he keeps
[1:13:29] telling us it's the end time we're here
[1:13:31] this has to happen something's going on
[1:13:34] are you catching it I hope you can catch
[1:13:36] it then he says it's been going on it's
[1:13:41] been going all the time right here in
[1:13:44] this
[1:13:45] meeting you know what probably happened
[1:13:47] if I would have been sitting there that
[1:13:48] day and didn't have this Revelation I
[1:13:50] would have been thinking of the most
[1:13:52] complicated difficult spiritual super
[1:13:55] natural wow moment thing that that could
[1:13:57] be going on and I would have missed the
[1:13:59] Simplicity of what it actually was it
[1:14:01] was actually a man coming and saying
[1:14:03] amen under this fifth seal this fifth
[1:14:05] seal these are souls these are these
[1:14:07] aren't Gentiles these are crying out for
[1:14:09] vengeance these have to be Jews this is
[1:14:11] what H what is that that's the seven
[1:14:13] Thunder amen that's the mystery that
[1:14:15] have been sealed up explaining what
[1:14:17] those symbols actually meant and it was
[1:14:19] happening right there and it was so
[1:14:20] simple that what they were hearing was
[1:14:22] one of the seven Thunders they've been
[1:14:24] hearing it all week signifying that the
[1:14:26] mighty angel had come down with an open
[1:14:28] book in his hand and the Seven seal was
[1:14:30] now open and they're sitting right in
[1:14:32] the middle of it and he's saying I hope
[1:14:34] you catch it I hope you see it's going
[1:14:35] on all the
[1:14:38] time I would have went home that night
[1:14:41] without the Revelation said God please
[1:14:42] show me you got to show me I know I'm
[1:14:44] missing something the prophet says I
[1:14:46] can't get it I'm not
[1:14:50] spiritual listen you don't have to be
[1:14:51] super spiritual to catch this you need a
[1:14:53] revelation from God am and it's like
[1:14:57] Ping that simple not complicated not
[1:15:02] deep it's not deep how deep is it to say
[1:15:06] that when brother Brandon when it came
[1:15:07] time to preach what was sealed up that
[1:15:09] John couldn't write that God would bring
[1:15:11] brother Brandon back from the West to
[1:15:13] reveal what John wasn't allowed to write
[1:15:15] and it happened to be the explanation of
[1:15:16] what the symbols
[1:15:18] were that's not
[1:15:20] hard that's simple
[1:15:26] questions and answers on the seals now
[1:15:28] he's come to Sunday morning that was
[1:15:30] Saturday night we just read now he's
[1:15:31] come to Sunday morning he collected all
[1:15:34] the questions and he's read through all
[1:15:35] the questions now after he reads through
[1:15:37] the questions look what he says then
[1:15:39] also knowing that right among you things
[1:15:41] are happening I'm just I know I know
[1:15:45] that you don't see it I'm just positive
[1:15:47] that you don't see it how does he now
[1:15:49] know last night he was hoping they were
[1:15:51] catching it but the night before on
[1:15:54] Thursday night he says I'll see the
[1:15:56] questions and I'll be able to see if
[1:15:57] you're getting it then last night he
[1:15:59] says I hope you're getting it it's going
[1:16:00] on all around you then he gets all the
[1:16:02] questions and he reads through all the
[1:16:04] questions and he says I know you're not
[1:16:05] getting
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:09] it praise be to God I'm just positive
[1:16:12] that you don't see it and you say and
[1:16:14] listen it's not cuz brother brandham
[1:16:16] knew all along that they're not going to
[1:16:17] see it he's hoping all along they see it
[1:16:19] I'm just waiting for somebody to rise up
[1:16:21] and say I see it it's going on around
[1:16:22] you I hope you catch it remember what I
[1:16:24] told you amen is going on right here
[1:16:26] he's wanting them to see it hoping that
[1:16:27] they'll see it expecting them to see it
[1:16:29] but then now when he comes to Sunday
[1:16:31] morning he's collected the questions and
[1:16:33] read the questions and read about
[1:16:35] deodorant and divorce and cutting hair
[1:16:37] and dying and whatever else they put on
[1:16:38] there he realizes they have no clue
[1:16:40] what's happening this
[1:16:44] week he doesn't get
[1:16:47] mad he realizes now it's not
[1:16:52] time he says I going to go back to this
[1:16:55] Sunday morning I'm just positive that
[1:16:57] you don't see it you say brother B
[1:17:00] that's a hard thing for you to say that
[1:17:01] I know it is but look let me just say
[1:17:03] this now I suppose this is just taped
[1:17:05] for ourselves and so forth but let me
[1:17:07] say this that you you don't you don't
[1:17:10] get it see and you're not supposed to
[1:17:12] get it so don't try to interpret
[1:17:16] anything don't try to put your
[1:17:18] interpretation to it you only get
[1:17:20] further
[1:17:21] away can you imagine not realizing that
[1:17:24] all all those things brother B was
[1:17:25] talking about I hope you see it I hope
[1:17:26] you catch it something spiritual is
[1:17:28] going on all the time and if you don't
[1:17:30] attach it to the preaching of the seven
[1:17:32] Thunders and you try to figure out what
[1:17:33] it was you can realize now that you
[1:17:35] would have been off in a multitude of
[1:17:37] rabbit chases going down the wrong road
[1:17:39] that's why he said don't try to
[1:17:41] interpret it wait for God to reveal it
[1:17:42] to you cuz once you see it you see it
[1:17:44] it's not a question mark it's not a
[1:17:45] guess it's not does it fit or doesn't
[1:17:47] fit it fits so perfect is like whmo
[1:17:50] that's it that's why he said don't try
[1:17:52] to interpret you don't have to try to
[1:17:54] interpret when God opens your eyes
[1:17:56] there's no interpretation needed it's
[1:17:57] self-
[1:17:59] interpreting it's all right there that's
[1:18:00] why he said just be humble just be quiet
[1:18:03] just pray for Revelation don't try to
[1:18:05] figure it out don't bend your mind to
[1:18:07] sort this out you don't have to bend
[1:18:08] your mind it doesn't take a mind bending
[1:18:11] it doesn't take super intellect it
[1:18:13] doesn't take that a child can understand
[1:18:15] what's going on in this week of
[1:18:20] services doesn't take super duper
[1:18:22] intelligence all it takes is the
[1:18:24] revelation
[1:18:25] that my goodness when he send him back
[1:18:28] to preach the seals that was the mystery
[1:18:32] contained in the Thunders that was what
[1:18:34] John wasn't allowed to write and now
[1:18:37] brother brenham's preaching it and what
[1:18:39] does that mean that means the Lord Has
[1:18:41] Come that means the Seven Seals open
[1:18:43] that means this is the end
[1:18:48] time praise
[1:18:50] God don't try to put your interpretation
[1:18:53] to it you'll get further
[1:18:57] away the seventh SE now notice remember
[1:19:00] the vision of the
[1:19:02] constellation this is the seventh seal

[1:22:31] he's he he's preached the Revelation
[1:22:33] under each one of those seals he comes
[1:22:34] down to the seventh seal and he's
[1:22:36] telling you he says one Thunder Sabino
[1:22:40] Canyon seven messages that's been sealed
[1:22:43] up and cannot be revealed till the last
[1:22:45] day what messages the seven Thunders
[1:22:47] from Revelation 10 that was sealed up
[1:22:50] till the last day till the angel said
[1:22:52] time is no more the end time now it's
[1:22:54] time to unseal it according to what
[1:22:56] Daniel was
[1:22:59] told now he says now you
[1:23:02] notice now you notice the mysterious
[1:23:06] part of this week that's what it
[1:23:10] is that's what it's been it's been not a
[1:23:14] human being a man it has been the angels
[1:23:17] of the
[1:23:18] Lord that's why brother B said this
[1:23:20] isn't mine this wasn't my mind this
[1:23:22] wasn't my idea this is not my
[1:23:23] interpretation he said God sent an angel
[1:23:26] to the room every day and gave me thus
[1:23:28] saith the Lord on what to seal it has
[1:23:30] nothing he said nothing to do with my
[1:23:32] understanding nothing to do with my
[1:23:33] intellect this is straight from God
[1:23:36] straight Revelation that's been hidden
[1:23:38] in the word amen coming right from God
[1:23:40] right to
[1:23:42] you that's what this has been the
[1:23:45] mystery that he was hoping everybody
[1:23:47] could catch it's been the preaching of
[1:23:49] the seals
[1:23:51] amen and the Seven seal again he says
[1:23:54] now
[1:23:55] how did I know the other day last Sunday
[1:23:58] a week ago when I was preaching on be
[1:24:00] humble be humble remember God deals in
[1:24:03] little things I didn't realize what it
[1:24:05] really was talking about and now I see
[1:24:08] it it is in such a humble way you think
[1:24:12] that something like that would be
[1:24:13] revealed to the Vatican or be put but it
[1:24:16] comes just like John the
[1:24:21] Baptist who else came just like John the
[1:24:23] Baptist
[1:24:25] Malachi 4 brother bam he's saying it
[1:24:29] comes it comes just like John the
[1:24:33] Baptist do you see
[1:24:36] it it comes just like John the Baptist
[1:24:39] it comes like the birth of our Lord in a
[1:24:44] stable what he's talking about he's
[1:24:46] talking about major prophetic events
[1:24:50] that almost nobody on Earth knew what
[1:24:51] was happening and it was in such
[1:24:53] Simplicity that there was a little woman
[1:24:55] and her husband back in a stable she
[1:24:57] delivered and nobody else in town knew
[1:24:59] it that night and nobody else on Earth
[1:25:01] knew what was going on except the Magi
[1:25:03] that saw the star were making their way
[1:25:05] amen you realize nobody knew what was
[1:25:07] happening the Angels had to come and say
[1:25:10] it to Shepherds so Shepherds could go to
[1:25:12] declare it am mean what was happening
[1:25:14] the greatest event of all time was
[1:25:16] taking place where was it taking place
[1:25:18] in a little stable in Bethlehem out of
[1:25:20] the way with no Fanfare nobody what was
[1:25:22] doing it why cuz God he hides himself in
[1:25:25] Simplicity and reveals himself in the
[1:25:28] same and brother R said you think
[1:25:30] something like
[1:25:33] that like what the seven seal the seven
[1:25:37] Thunders the great Revelation that's
[1:25:40] waiting till the end of time the opening
[1:25:41] of the seventh seal you think something
[1:25:44] like that would be revealed to the
[1:25:46] Vatican or but it comes just like John
[1:25:49] the Baptist it comes like the birth of
[1:25:51] our Lord in a stable glory to God so
[1:25:53] help me that hour is at hand we're
[1:25:57] here oh my now do you see it the truth
[1:26:01] of God's Vision the seven angels
[1:26:03] bringing me from the West they were
[1:26:05] coming from the West Coming Back East
[1:26:08] bringing me here for this message
[1:26:11] tonight what message the seventh seal
[1:26:14] amen what are they bring him back for so
[1:26:17] that you would know the seventh seal is
[1:26:20] open again in the seventh seal now we
[1:26:23] are grateful to God for what he has
[1:26:25] showed us I've been sitting in the room
[1:26:27] up there for8 days and the message that
[1:26:29] I have just got through explaining to
[1:26:30] you many of you here will understand and
[1:26:33] I promis that there was something going
[1:26:35] on spiritual all the time that I was
[1:26:38] sure you were missing it and here's what
[1:26:42] it
[1:26:43] is it's the absolute a Vindication of
[1:26:46] this interpretation of the scriptures
[1:26:48] being sin of God because before we even
[1:26:51] went into it I left to go
[1:26:57] West what are you talking about left to
[1:26:59] go west something supernatural's been
[1:27:01] going on all around tell me what's been
[1:27:02] going on well you have to understand why
[1:27:05] I went West and when I come back to
[1:27:07] understand what's been going on
[1:27:08] Supernatural spiritually all this
[1:27:12] week I want to read it again I promise
[1:27:15] that there's something going on
[1:27:16] spiritual all the time that I was sure
[1:27:19] you were missing it and here's what it
[1:27:22] is it's the absolute a Vindication of
[1:27:25] this interpretation of the scriptures
[1:27:26] being sent of God because before we even
[1:27:29] went into it I left to go west and the
[1:27:32] Lord showed me a vision one day about
[1:27:33] 10:00 one morning and I came and I
[1:27:36] explained it here that I had seen it I
[1:27:38] didn't know what it was it was a
[1:27:39] constellation of angels well well
[1:27:42] remember that you'll get it on tape
[1:27:44] called what time is it sir well now that
[1:27:47] is exactly what you're seeing
[1:27:50] now what were you seeing what he
[1:27:52] preached and what time is it sir amen
[1:27:55] that's why that's why brother brandham
[1:27:57] changed the
[1:27:58] title catch this brother brandham
[1:28:02] changed the
[1:28:03] title when he preached it before it was
[1:28:05] a question is this the sign of the
[1:28:08] answer is this the sign that's the
[1:28:10] question and he's asking could it be
[1:28:12] could this be the end time could those
[1:28:14] Thunders could that be what it
[1:28:16] is then brother brandham goes and has
[1:28:18] the experience out west and now he knows
[1:28:19] it's the end time he tells you it's the
[1:28:21] end time he tells you we're here and
[1:28:22] it's no longer for him a question his
[1:28:25] question is answered when he changes the
[1:28:28] name now the question is directed to you
[1:28:31] what time is it serves now the question
[1:28:34] is not his question he's got the answer
[1:28:36] to the question now brother bam he never
[1:28:39] says is this the sign of the end s he
[1:28:41] never uses that title again but he very
[1:28:43] specifically uses it when he first
[1:28:45] preaches it and doesn't use the title
[1:28:47] what time is it s he's very specific is
[1:28:49] this the sign of the end sir that's his
[1:28:52] question that's what he's wondering
[1:28:53] that's what he's supposing he gets the
[1:28:55] answer and he's satisfied that he knows
[1:28:58] this is the end
[1:28:59] time but then from then on he changes
[1:29:02] the title and never uses that title
[1:29:04] again from now on the question is is
[1:29:08] this no no what time is it
[1:29:13] s now the question is yours to answer by
[1:29:17] Revelation now you've got to answer the
[1:29:19] question now the question is directed to
[1:29:20] you not to the prophet anymore he's not
[1:29:22] confused he's not wondering he's not
[1:29:24] pursuing anymore he knows that this is
[1:29:27] the seventh seal this is the time now
[1:29:29] the question is your question what time
[1:29:30] is it
[1:29:31] sir I'm asking you what time is it is it
[1:29:34] the opening of The Seven seal is it the
[1:29:36] coming of the Lord is it the revealing
[1:29:38] of the Mysteries is it the end
[1:29:41] time oh praise God now the question is
[1:29:44] ours to answer what time is it
[1:29:47] sir praise be to
[1:29:49] God questions and answers he says have
[1:29:52] the seven Thunders which equal seven
[1:29:54] Mysteries already been revealed were
[1:29:56] they revealed in the Seven Seals but are
[1:29:58] yet but are yet not known to us as the
[1:30:01] Thunders yet do I mean are they still
[1:30:04] mysterious and we still don't know what
[1:30:05] the Thunders
[1:30:07] are he says
[1:30:09] no they were revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:30:12] that's what the Thunders was about it
[1:30:15] was the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:30:17] that's what the Thunders was he makes it
[1:30:19] so
[1:30:20] simple they was to reveal the seven
[1:30:23] Thunders that had uttered their voices
[1:30:24] and no one could make out what it was
[1:30:26] John knew what it was but he was
[1:30:27] forbidden to write it he said but the
[1:30:29] seventh angel in the days of the
[1:30:31] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[1:30:33] seven Thunders would be revealed and the
[1:30:35] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[1:30:37] seventh Church age who is William
[1:30:41] brandham which means but the seventh
[1:30:44] angel in the days of his sounding the
[1:30:46] seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:30:47] would be
[1:30:49] revealed praise God and the latery in
[1:30:53] church age now he ties this together
[1:30:54] with Malachi 4 we've been through that
[1:30:57] says he'll do turn two things he will
[1:30:59] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:31:00] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[1:31:03] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:31:05] it will be those divinely revealed
[1:31:07] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:31:09] hearts of the children to the
[1:31:11] Pentecostal
[1:31:13] fathers Malachi 4 is fulfilled in
[1:31:17] Revelation 101
[1:31:19] to7 in the revealing of the seals
[1:31:24] he says when those Seven Seals were
[1:31:27] opened that opened up the entire
[1:31:31] Bible and again he says the hidden
[1:31:34] mysteries of Christ was fully revealed
[1:31:36] and the Seven Seals I made this
[1:31:38] statement asked this question last time
[1:31:40] but I'll ask it again if the entire
[1:31:42] Bible was open in the Seven Seals and
[1:31:45] the mystery of Christ was fully revealed
[1:31:47] in the Seven
[1:31:48] Seals why would we need anybody else to
[1:31:51] come and reveal anything else
[1:31:55] right if the hidden mystery of Christ
[1:31:57] was fully revealed then there's not
[1:32:01] still a mystery of Christ to
[1:32:05] reveal if the Bible if the opening of
[1:32:08] Seven Seals open up the entire Bible
[1:32:11] then there's no more of the Bible to
[1:32:12] open
[1:32:13] up so why would we need another great
[1:32:16] man or another messenger or another
[1:32:18] great person or somebody else to come
[1:32:20] why would we need something else to come
[1:32:23] before we can go in the Rapture and we
[1:32:24] need somebody else to fulfill something
[1:32:26] else it's already
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:30] fulfilled if we need somebody else to
[1:32:32] open something else that means that it
[1:32:34] wasn't open it's been opened now for us
[1:32:38] there's still parts that we don't
[1:32:40] see is that right yes there's still
[1:32:43] parts that we don't see there's still
[1:32:45] things I don't understand there's still
[1:32:47] parts and pieces that I I can't explain
[1:32:50] to you that I don't know amen but that
[1:32:52] doesn't mean somebody else has to come
[1:32:54] because it's already in the message amen
[1:32:56] everything we need's already been
[1:32:58] revealed in the message we're just
[1:32:59] waiting for God to click the Revelation
[1:33:01] so that we can see what's already laying
[1:33:03] there we don't need someone else to come
[1:33:06] we don't need another interpretation and
[1:33:08] listen I I'll tell you this and and and
[1:33:10] and and and just take me for what I'm
[1:33:12] saying and understand me as your brother
[1:33:14] amen God will use the five-fold ministry
[1:33:17] to help us keep unlocking this mystery
[1:33:19] over and over it's his tool it's the
[1:33:21] tool in his hand for him to speak to his
[1:33:23] children amen he's not going to take
[1:33:25] some super duper it's going to be the
[1:33:27] fivefold ministry worldwide that he's
[1:33:29] going to anoint to take the word and
[1:33:30] keep breaking the word till we all come
[1:33:33] into the unity of Faith till we all come
[1:33:35] into the stature of a perfect man amen
[1:33:37] that what's God is the bride going to
[1:33:39] have a Ministry in the end time he says
[1:33:40] yes it's a great ministry it's going on
[1:33:42] all the time it consists of apostle
[1:33:44] prophets evangelist teachers and pastors
[1:33:46] what is it that's the ministry of the
[1:33:47] Bride what is the ministry of the Bride
[1:33:49] to take this Revelation and keep
[1:33:51] preaching it and preaching and preaching
[1:33:52] and God keeps folding it through where
[1:33:55] through the fivefold
[1:33:57] ministry that's how God does it amen
[1:34:00] we're not looking for another Prophet
[1:34:02] we're not looking for a great Apostle
[1:34:03] what we're looking to do is keep
[1:34:05] laboring in this word and praying for
[1:34:06] Revelation and God keeps giving it Peace
[1:34:08] by Peace by Peace by piece by piece as
[1:34:11] we move
[1:34:12] forward but we don't need another
[1:34:16] message we need isav to see the

[1:36:11] praying in the watch Night Service
[1:36:13] looking to the coming year and he's
[1:36:14] saying open this year Lord the hidden
[1:36:16] Mana the rock beneath the rock what was
[1:36:19] hidden Mana hidden Mana was the Mana
[1:36:21] amen that was back in the temple and the
[1:36:23] holy of holies cuz Moses was told to
[1:36:25] take a golden uh sensor and to take this
[1:36:28] golden vessel and take some of the Mana
[1:36:30] that fell in the Exodus Journey the Mana
[1:36:32] that they would eat that would dissolve
[1:36:34] when the sun came up that wouldn't keep
[1:36:36] from the next day to the next he was
[1:36:37] told to take it fill it amen in this
[1:36:40] golden vessel and put it in the holy of
[1:36:41] holies and it would keep from generation
[1:36:43] to generation and that became the hidden
[1:36:46] Mana nobody could see it but the
[1:36:48] priesthood and when the priesthood goes
[1:36:50] in the high priest when he went in on
[1:36:51] the day of atonement he could take some
[1:36:53] of hidden mana and he could eat that
[1:36:55] hidden Mana so that was the hidden Mana
[1:36:57] but brother Brenham now was praying he
[1:36:59] said Lord open this year Lord that
[1:37:02] hidden Mana what's hidden mana mana is
[1:37:05] the word Mana is the word that fell day
[1:37:07] by day but there was a hidden Mana that
[1:37:10] nobody could see back in the shikina
[1:37:12] glory of God back where God dwelt but
[1:37:14] there was Mana that was hiding in the
[1:37:16] back heart of God's mind and the holy of
[1:37:18] holies that nobody could see light had
[1:37:20] never shined on this before and brother
[1:37:22] brandom saying God open this year that
[1:37:25] hidden Mana that mystery in the back
[1:37:27] part of your
[1:37:29] mind that rock beneath the rock what was
[1:37:33] the rock beneath the Rock The White Rock
[1:37:35] that had nothing written on it the
[1:37:36] revelation of the seven
[1:37:38] Thunders the rock beneath the rock that
[1:37:41] why that we might see the program of God
[1:37:43] what did he want what are we supposed to
[1:37:45] see at the opening of the seals what are
[1:37:47] we supposed to understand at the end
[1:37:50] time seal we're supposed to understand
[1:37:51] the program of God
[1:37:54] amen then he goes in this this is where
[1:37:57] I want to focus
[1:37:58] now cap off the pyramids of our life
[1:38:02] Lord put the Capstone Christ Jesus upon
[1:38:06] each and every one of us may his great
[1:38:09] magnificent holy blessing be upon us
[1:38:12] all he talks about the great Revelation
[1:38:14] the rock beneath the Rock open it and
[1:38:16] give it but Lord cap off the Pyramid of
[1:38:20] our lives and when he says that he's
[1:38:22] referring right back to of a perfect man
[1:38:25] those Seven Virtues to the capping of
[1:38:27] love which is
[1:38:28] gone and he ends by saying let this
[1:38:32] Revelation let this Mana let this
[1:38:35] rock bring us to maturity so that you
[1:38:38] can cap off our
[1:38:40] lives that's what this mystery is
[1:38:42] supposed to do supposed to bring us into
[1:38:45] the stature of a perfect man to
[1:38:50] maturity now we come to Revelation 2:17
[1:38:53] remember I I titled this a white rock
[1:38:57] and a white stone the White Rock and the
[1:38:59] white stone the White Rock was the rock
[1:39:00] beneath the Rock in junior Jackson's
[1:39:04] dream but now we're going to look at a
[1:39:06] white
[1:39:07] stone say he that hath an ear let him
[1:39:10] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:39:11] children to him that overcometh will I
[1:39:13] give to eat of the Hidden mana and I
[1:39:17] will give him a white stone and in the
[1:39:20] stone a new name written which no man
[1:39:22] knoweth save he that receiveth him if
[1:39:24] you remember brother Gabe mentioned this
[1:39:26] a few weeks back when he was preaching
[1:39:27] and he he talking about if you go into
[1:39:29] the concordance and you look at the
[1:39:30] different definition they show you that
[1:39:32] in ancient times in Greek civilization
[1:39:34] that many times they would pass the
[1:39:36] verdict of judgment by giving you either
[1:39:37] a white stone or a black stone the black
[1:39:39] stone meant you were condemned the white
[1:39:40] stone meant you were acquitted and that
[1:39:43] and that happens and so there there's
[1:39:45] several meanings behind this white stone
[1:39:48] one you realize little bride you never
[1:39:50] did it in the first place that's what we
[1:39:52] realize under the seven seal amen under
[1:39:55] this capping we go back into the mind of
[1:39:57] God and realize what predestination
[1:39:58] really was what a c Gene of God was what
[1:40:00] a child of God actually is amen what
[1:40:03] went wrong in the beginning and why
[1:40:05] we're in this condition and how we've
[1:40:07] been washed by the bleeding bloody word
[1:40:09] and brought back into a virgin condition
[1:40:10] so that you can have true justification
[1:40:13] not justification that that Luther
[1:40:15] taught in the church age but true
[1:40:16] justification you never did it in the
[1:40:19] first
[1:40:20] place it's not part of your record
[1:40:23] praise God Amen so he says now to him
[1:40:26] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[1:40:27] the Hidden mana and will give him a
[1:40:28] white stone and in the stone a new name
[1:40:31] written which no man knoweth save he
[1:40:34] that receiveth
[1:40:35] it I want us to to focus on this white
[1:40:38] stone now for for the rest of the time
[1:40:41] we have here together this
[1:40:43] morning brother baham goes to the pergan
[1:40:46] church age which is this section of the
[1:40:48] Book of Revelation that we just read
[1:40:49] that scripture he says it also says here
[1:40:53] that he's going to give the Overcomer a
[1:40:55] white stone and in not
[1:40:59] on the stone a new name it's really
[1:41:03] important which the owner alone knows
[1:41:06] now the idea of a new name is familiar
[1:41:08] when Abram was changed to Abraham Sarai
[1:41:11] to Sarah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter
[1:41:14] and Saul to Paul these names either
[1:41:17] brought about a change or were given
[1:41:19] because of a change catch this
[1:41:23] if you overcome in your generation
[1:41:26] you're going to receive a white
[1:41:28] stone and in the white stone a new name
[1:41:32] and whenever he gave a new name it was
[1:41:34] because he was going to bring a change
[1:41:36] or because he had already brought a
[1:41:37] change but the name signified a change
[1:41:40] amen amen and Abram Sarah and and Saul
[1:41:45] amen and pet and Simon Peter and and
[1:41:47] Jacob to Israel every time that he
[1:41:49] changed the name it was because there
[1:41:51] was a major change in their life life
[1:41:54] amen so now he's he's teaching this
[1:41:57] principle and it was only after Abram
[1:41:58] and Sarah had their name changed by the
[1:42:01] Lord that they were made ready to
[1:42:02] receive the coming son in Jacob's case
[1:42:05] he had to overcome and then he was
[1:42:07] called a prince in the case of Simon and
[1:42:09] Saul when they had received the Lord
[1:42:12] their change came and today each one of
[1:42:14] us True Believers has had a change in
[1:42:16] name we are Christians it is a name
[1:42:19] common to all of us but one day we will
[1:42:22] have another change we will of certainty
[1:42:24] receive a new name it could well be that
[1:42:27] the name was our true and original name
[1:42:29] written in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[1:42:31] the foundation of the world he knows the
[1:42:33] name but we do not one day at his good
[1:42:36] pleasure we will know
[1:42:39] also now I want you to just bear with me
[1:42:43] as we we work on this thought of a white
[1:42:46] stone and the white in the white stone
[1:42:49] but not on it is a new name
[1:42:53] brother B begins to talk about how the
[1:42:55] change in the name was because there was
[1:42:57] a major
[1:42:59] change either the changing a name
[1:43:01] brought overcoming power or overcoming
[1:43:03] brought a change in the
[1:43:05] name and he and he starts to attach
[1:43:07] these thoughts together and then he goes
[1:43:09] on to say that we've already had a name
[1:43:11] change we're called Christians so that's
[1:43:14] a title not a name but he calls it a
[1:43:16] name change so if your title changes
[1:43:19] that's a name change yes amen
[1:43:23] and he says now that name could very
[1:43:25] well be the one that's written in the
[1:43:27] Lamb's Book of Life we don't know that
[1:43:28] but he does and someday we all will know
[1:43:30] now now now I'm not taking away anything
[1:43:32] brother Benham said because I have no
[1:43:34] idea what's actually written in the
[1:43:36] Lamb's Book of Life because I don't know
[1:43:38] if there's actual paper in heaven and
[1:43:41] ink and you understand it's a spiritual
[1:43:44] word I don't understand how it works I
[1:43:46] don't understand how big the book is I
[1:43:49] don't even know if there's a physical
[1:43:50] book or if the book represents something
[1:43:53] something in the mind of God you
[1:43:55] understand what I'm saying I'm not
[1:43:57] trying to discredit anything I'm just
[1:43:58] telling us we always think carnal and
[1:44:00] God uses carnal representation to get us
[1:44:02] to understand something that doesn't
[1:44:03] mean it's actually the way it is he's
[1:44:06] trying to get us in an Earthly existence
[1:44:08] to understand what he's talking about so
[1:44:11] we could all have names that and I'm
[1:44:14] sure we will I'm sure we'll call each
[1:44:15] other something I doubt that I'm going
[1:44:17] to be number 452 and you're going to be
[1:44:19] 489 I mean we're going to have a name
[1:44:22] and God knows what that name is what
[1:44:23] language it's in I don't know how to
[1:44:25] spell it I don't know what is the
[1:44:27] language we're all going to speak I
[1:44:28] don't know I don't
[1:44:31] know but one thing I know is every major
[1:44:34] change comes with a name change and when
[1:44:36] he changed us from Center to Christian
[1:44:38] that was a name
[1:44:40] change so we may have many name changes
[1:44:43] in our existence might not just be the
[1:44:46] one at the end we may have many name
[1:44:48] changes as our title
[1:44:50] changes now notice this rock
[1:44:55] what's the name look at that rock and
[1:44:58] tell me what the revelation of the name
[1:45:00] is you can't because it's not written on
[1:45:03] the Rock it's written in the
[1:45:07] Rock oh let's put our spiritual jackets
[1:45:11] on this isn't about physical this is
[1:45:14] about Revelation friends this is not
[1:45:16] what's written on the outside of the
[1:45:17] rock to read this is what's inside of
[1:45:19] the rock how do you read what's inside
[1:45:21] of the Rock Amen are we going to all get
[1:45:23] big hammers one day when the stones are
[1:45:25] hand us and we all go through and break
[1:45:26] them to see what our name is amen
[1:45:28] there's something in the Rock and what's
[1:45:31] in the rock is my identification my
[1:45:34] identity is sealed inside this Stone
[1:45:37] amen and nobody can see what it is
[1:45:40] because it's not on the outside of the
[1:45:42] stone it's in the
[1:45:45] stone so even if God hands you a
[1:45:48] physical Stone today you're not going to
[1:45:50] be able to look at that stone and read a
[1:45:52] name and know what you're name is
[1:45:54] because there's nothing written on the
[1:45:58] stone was there another White Rock with
[1:46:00] nothing written on it it was the
[1:46:02] Revelation that was in the Seven Seals
[1:46:04] amen the Revelation in the Thunders
[1:46:06] there was nothing written what was it it
[1:46:08] was White Rock here's another white
[1:46:10] stone Only The Rock was massive this
[1:46:12] one's just a little
[1:46:14] piece and that little piece doesn't have
[1:46:17] anything physical written on it but it
[1:46:19] has your identity sealed inside side of
[1:46:26] it that's why no man knows the name but
[1:46:30] he that receiveth
[1:46:32] it because nobody else can read it amen
[1:46:36] you could show it to everybody but
[1:46:38] nobody's going to know what your new
[1:46:40] name is because only the one who's
[1:46:42] received it will know the name but
[1:46:44] they're not going to get it by reading
[1:46:46] the rock they're going to get it by a
[1:46:48] spiritual revelation of what's inside
[1:46:51] the Rock
[1:46:53] amen praise be to God I'm so tired of
[1:46:58] carinal I'm so tired of natural I'm
[1:47:00] ready to drop all that and say God lift
[1:47:02] me up into the revelation of this word
[1:47:04] where the reality strikes my
[1:47:08] soul I wonder sometimes if people get to
[1:47:11] heaven if they don't get a White Rock if
[1:47:12] they're going to be disappointed and
[1:47:13] asked to leave or think they're in the
[1:47:14] right wrong
[1:47:16] spot because we made everything so
[1:47:18] physical
[1:47:21] yes it's not not on the Rock it's in the
[1:47:27] Rock when brother bam took that cap off
[1:47:30] there was nothing written on it it was a
[1:47:32] sealed veiled
[1:47:35] mystery here's what brother B says all
[1:47:37] the way back in 56 the Bible said he
[1:47:40] that overcometh will I give a white
[1:47:41] stone in a new name that no one knows
[1:47:44] but he but he himself don't make any
[1:47:47] difference what people say you know
[1:47:49] yourself when you've been brought into
[1:47:50] the inner Veil
[1:47:54] now he's attaching this White Rock to
[1:47:57] you coming into the inner veil with
[1:47:58] Jesus Christ you're Union with Christ
[1:48:01] your new birth your baptism of the Holy
[1:48:03] Ghost he's attaching it to this White
[1:48:06] Rock which is your
[1:48:08] identification so don't make any
[1:48:10] difference what people say you know
[1:48:11] yourself when you've been brought into
[1:48:13] the inner Veil no one could tell you any
[1:48:15] different not because you joined church
[1:48:17] because you did this or that but
[1:48:18] something just tells you you've got a
[1:48:21] stone
[1:48:25] that's in your
[1:48:27] heart not a hard Stone a soft one this
[1:48:30] Stone makes your heart soft instead of
[1:48:32] hard see how brother bam uses the same
[1:48:35] analogy of a stone and he makes it your
[1:48:37] new birth when the Revelation comes into
[1:48:39] your heart yes sir so don't get fixated
[1:48:42] there may there may very well be an
[1:48:44] absolute natural representation and I'll
[1:48:46] be thrilled to death to get
[1:48:49] it amen but I believe I've already
[1:48:52] received my White
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:54] Stone by the grace of
[1:48:58] God in the third seal brother says John
[1:49:02] said everybody in heaven everybody
[1:49:04] beneath the Earth everybody heard him
[1:49:06] where is this this is in this is in uh
[1:49:08] Revelation chapter 5 when the lamb takes
[1:49:10] the book amen he starts rejoicing
[1:49:13] everybody in heaven everything beneath
[1:49:14] the Earth everything heard him praising
[1:49:16] God about it John must have found his
[1:49:18] name on there you know amen well he saw
[1:49:23] the lamb take the book when the lamb
[1:49:25] take the book listen this is happening
[1:49:26] in Vision amen at this point the book is
[1:49:29] still sealed he hasn't even opened the
[1:49:30] seals yet that comes in Revelation
[1:49:32] chapter 6 but brother brandom says John
[1:49:35] must have found his name on there you
[1:49:37] know the question is the book wasn't
[1:49:40] even open yet if it was open was it open
[1:49:42] to the page where John could look and
[1:49:44] see and then if he wrote John in there
[1:49:46] what kind of ink did he use and what
[1:49:48] kind of language did he write it
[1:49:50] in yes yes you understand John's in the
[1:49:55] vision he sees the lamb come forth he's
[1:49:57] weeping because he knows all Redemption
[1:49:59] is lost if nobody can take this book now
[1:50:01] an elder comes and tells him weep not
[1:50:03] for the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:50:05] prevailed and overcome to take the book
[1:50:06] and to loose the seals thereof and he
[1:50:08] steps forward a bloody lamb he takes the
[1:50:10] book they all start rejoicing the Angels
[1:50:13] pour out the prayers and incense of the
[1:50:14] Saints amen and John starts shouting and
[1:50:17] rejoicing and praising God Amen brother
[1:50:19] B says why he must have found his name
[1:50:22] on there the question is how did he find
[1:50:25] his name on there he doesn't take the
[1:50:27] little book and eat it till you get to
[1:50:28] Revelations chap 10 when the mighty
[1:50:30] Angel comes down friends this is just
[1:50:33] brother Chad you can take it or leave it
[1:50:35] but I believe it was a spiritual
[1:50:37] Revelation to John not something he was
[1:50:39] reading on paper but he was recognizing
[1:50:42] I'm part of that Redemption my name is
[1:50:45] on that book and he caught it by
[1:50:47] Revelation that John's in there and it
[1:50:49] may not be pronounced John it may not be
[1:50:51] spelled and John's name wasn't even John
[1:50:54] like we say John
[1:50:56] now probably had a Hebrew or Armenian
[1:50:59] name and it was spelled with characters
[1:51:01] maybe we don't understand it doesn't
[1:51:03] matter that doesn't matter that's only
[1:51:05] for this Earthly existence but we have
[1:51:07] another identification that's not the
[1:51:09] name on your birth certificate and
[1:51:11] that's the C Gene of God that was in the
[1:51:13] back part of his
[1:51:14] [Music]
[1:51:16] mind and John must have
[1:51:19] looked and found his name in there it
[1:51:22] wasn't like John took the book out Jesus
[1:51:24] hand
[1:51:31] start praise
[1:51:34] God the first seal he says now watch
[1:51:37] said it would be known in the last day
[1:51:39] but it comes forth in a church symbol do
[1:51:41] you understand it Church it comes forth
[1:51:43] in a symbol of a church that they know
[1:51:45] there is a seal but just what it is they
[1:51:48] don't know because it's a white horse
[1:51:49] rider and it's only to be revealed at
[1:51:52] the last day when the actual seal is
[1:51:55] broken broken to
[1:51:58] who not to Christ but to the church
[1:52:01] notice how my that just makes me tremble
[1:52:04] I hope that the church truly understands
[1:52:06] it see what I mean you people I'm going
[1:52:09] to call you bride that you'll understand
[1:52:12] it amen what's he just done we're in the
[1:52:15] first seal the first seal now is what he
[1:52:18] started preaching the Thunders amen the
[1:52:20] Mysteries the White Rock that that had
[1:52:22] been sealed in the back of God's mind
[1:52:24] and he comes in the first seal and he
[1:52:26] says listen you've got to understand
[1:52:28] something and to understand that you've
[1:52:29] got to catch a revelation and you need a
[1:52:32] change like Abram and Sarah needed a
[1:52:34] change and that change is going to be a
[1:52:36] prophet pronouncing to you your true
[1:52:38] identity I'm not going to call you
[1:52:40] church anymore this isn't church church
[1:52:42] ages is done I'm going to call you bride
[1:52:45] this is a transition time this is the
[1:52:48] opening of the
[1:52:50] seals amen
[1:52:54] the seals listen he says now when the
[1:52:57] seals actually
[1:53:00] broke that means there's no future
[1:53:02] actually breaking of the seal the Seal's
[1:53:04] actually broke in reality who's it broke
[1:53:07] to not the Christ he knew what it was
[1:53:09] all along it's broke to the church he
[1:53:12] says Church oh my that just makes me
[1:53:15] tremble I hope the church truly
[1:53:17] understands it see as Church you're not
[1:53:19] going to understand it you can't get
[1:53:21] this revelation this church just like
[1:53:23] Abram couldn't receive the son and Sarah
[1:53:25] couldn't receive the son Church can't
[1:53:27] receive this revelation of the seven
[1:53:29] Thunders the mystery it's going to take
[1:53:31] a change in your identification a change
[1:53:35] in your name and you're going to have to
[1:53:36] go from church to bride so that you'll
[1:53:40] understand
[1:53:42] it praise be to God I could preach this
[1:53:46] every day of my life and never get tired
[1:53:48] of it this is the message this is who we
[1:53:51] are this is what awaken the bride this
[1:53:53] is the bride's Revival this is what's
[1:53:55] giving her rapturing faith in the
[1:53:56] ability to overcome all the lies that
[1:53:59] the devil's been spewing for thousands
[1:54:00] of years it's all under this
[1:54:06] Revelation
[1:54:08] amen he says in Feast of trumpets notice

[1:56:27] this Revelation is is a private
[1:56:30] Revelation only for his
[1:56:32] bride so there must come a personal
[1:56:35] revelation of who we are so that we can
[1:56:37] receive this
[1:56:41] Revelation the message once more he says
[1:56:44] if the church can overcome she will stop
[1:56:46] saying listen if the church can overcome
[1:56:50] she will stop saying I'm a Methodist
[1:56:53] Baptist Presbyterian we she can overcome
[1:56:55] her Creeds and the world that's drawing
[1:56:57] her there she'll come back to the bride
[1:56:59] of Christ misses Jesus Christ what is

[1:57:08] Catholic we'll stop saying all of that
[1:57:10] we'll even stop saying our specific
[1:57:12] version of the message but we'll come
[1:57:14] back to one identification and that
[1:57:17] identification is Mrs Jesus Christ that
[1:57:19] has to be who I am I'm not Mrs I'm I'm
[1:57:22] not this kind of believer or this kind
[1:57:24] of believer following this kind of
[1:57:25] Doctrine forget all of that I don't want
[1:57:28] that title all of that title will denote
[1:57:30] something that will keep me down I need
[1:57:32] a title that'll Lift Me Above everything
[1:57:34] that a human being can do and I need the
[1:57:37] title of Bride and more specifically I
[1:57:39] need to drop Methodist Baptist this
[1:57:41] persuasion that flavor and I need to
[1:57:43] come back to being mrss Jesus Christ
[1:57:52] you can say you can even think isn't
[1:57:54] that
[1:57:56] presumptuous well how presumptuous was
[1:57:59] it when Paul
[1:58:02] said I'm the light to the
[1:58:05] Gentiles how presumptuous would it been
[1:58:08] for the Virgin Mary to say I'm the
[1:58:10] Fulfillment of Isaiah
[1:58:11] 7 how presumptuous was it for brother
[1:58:14] brandom to believe he was Malachi
[1:58:18] 4 how presumptuous was it for Jesus
[1:58:20] Christ to believe he was the son of man
[1:58:23] the Son of
[1:58:24] God listen you can think what you want
[1:58:26] to think but when it's a revelation to
[1:58:28] you you can't help it it's who you are
[1:58:31] it's your identification it's the
[1:58:32] reality of your life it's not a put on
[1:58:34] it's not a make belief It's Not sewing
[1:58:37] titles over my shirt so I look like I'm
[1:58:38] some it's the reality that is in the
[1:58:40] depths of my heart that God through this
[1:58:42] message has unlocked something to me he
[1:58:45] has shown me amen before you see white
[1:58:48] stones laying around they're just rocks
[1:58:49] amen amen they don't have anything on
[1:58:51] them they they're they're not anything
[1:58:53] specific they don't indicate what's on
[1:58:54] on the inside but one day God will hand
[1:58:57] you when you overcome denominationalism
[1:58:59] when you overcome yourself in your own
[1:59:01] thinking and die out the self he'll hand
[1:59:03] you a white stone and in that white
[1:59:05] stone is a new name which identifies who
[1:59:08] you really
[1:59:10] are and no man knows that name but he
[1:59:13] that receiveth the stone am it's a
[1:59:16] personal revelation to you not because
[1:59:19] you attend a certain church or you're
[1:59:20] born in a certain family or you sit in a
[1:59:22] certain Pew that has nothing to do with
[1:59:24] it you can't get it you can't catch it
[1:59:26] like you catch the flu you can't get it
[1:59:28] through osmosis you have to get it by a
[1:59:31] divine revelation where God personally
[1:59:33] hands you something that gives you a new
[1:59:35] identity and by Revelation you know what
[1:59:38] this Revelation contains it's who I
[1:59:44] am he says in Christ's mystery of God
[1:59:47] revealed praise God praise God Christ in
[1:59:51] you makes him the center of the life of
[1:59:52] the Revelation Christ life in you makes
[1:59:55] him the center of the Revelation Christ
[1:59:56] in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:59:57] complete revelation of Christ Christ in
[2:00:00] you makes you the complete revelation of
[2:00:02] the whole thing see what God is trying
[2:00:04] to do what's he trying to do Under the
[2:00:07] seven seal under the end time it's the
[2:00:09] mystery of God is going to be finished
[2:00:11] God's revealing his great mystery and
[2:00:13] guess what you're part of
[2:00:16] it that's exactly what the prophet tells
[2:00:19] us amen listen I'm going to find this
[2:00:22] quote here I want to read it to
[2:00:24] you before we move
[2:00:27] on he says and this is again in Christ
[2:00:30] mystery of God revealed he is the first
[2:00:32] fruits of the Resurrection is that right
[2:00:34] then what is he he is the head of the
[2:00:36] body which is his church bride then the
[2:00:40] bride body must follow the head for it
[2:00:43] is part of his resurrection and part of
[2:00:46] the
[2:00:47] mystery so when he says under the seven
[2:00:49] seal the mystery of God will be revealed
[2:00:51] brother comes and preaches the seven
[2:00:53] seal and he titles it Christ is the
[2:00:56] mystery of God revealed well Christ is
[2:00:59] Mr and M Jesus Christ combined together
[2:01:03] bridegroom tree bride tree male and
[2:01:05] female amen reflecting one another
[2:01:08] United together in a holy Union and
[2:01:10] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:01:12] that's why brother Brenham said for the
[2:01:14] bride body must follow the head for it
[2:01:15] is part of his resurrection and part of
[2:01:19] the
[2:01:20] mystery for you to be part of that
[2:01:22] mystery you better get one of those
[2:01:23] white
[2:01:25] stones that has something locked inside
[2:01:29] yeah that nobody can tell amen only he
[2:01:34] who receives
[2:01:37] it again this is just your brother Chad
[2:01:40] this is just
[2:01:41] me I'll say like brother alist said this
[2:01:43] is just my
[2:01:45] excitement he said it so
[2:01:50] nice that that Great White Rock that was
[2:01:53] under the pyramid that was the mystery
[2:01:55] that was contained in this Bible it was
[2:01:58] the mystery of God it was one desire one
[2:02:00] goal one thing he wanted to achieve and
[2:02:02] every character in The Bible's been
[2:02:04] typing it out amen every character every
[2:02:08] story's been W trying to show you what
[2:02:10] the unwritten part is all about the
[2:02:15] mystery that's the White Rock under the
[2:02:19] rock but what is the white stone
[2:02:23] to me the white stone is just a
[2:02:26] part of the White
[2:02:29] Rock and brother bandham said what are
[2:02:32] the Believers the names on the the words
[2:02:35] on the book are the Believers what is
[2:02:37] this she is part of the mystery you're
[2:02:40] part of the mystery and what is that
[2:02:42] White Rock to me this is just to me to
[2:02:44] me in my Revelation what God has done in
[2:02:46] my life that rock is my part of that
[2:02:49] great big mystery in the Bible that's my
[2:02:52] little portion C genene of God portion
[2:02:54] of God his purpose in my life to
[2:02:56] manifest in this day and locked inside
[2:02:59] that Revelation is my true identity who
[2:03:02] I really am from the Lamb's Book of
[2:03:08] Life said the bride body must follow the
[2:03:11] head for it's part of the resurrection
[2:03:12] and part of the mystery it's impossible
[2:03:14] for it not to go it's part of God's
[2:03:19] mystery that's my portion of that great
[2:03:22] big rock one of the one little chunk off
[2:03:26] of
[2:03:27] that is my portion and my personal
[2:03:30] revelation of who I am in
[2:03:37] Christ oh I got to finish this quote he
[2:03:40] said Christ and you makes you the
[2:03:42] complete revelation of the whole thing
[2:03:44] what is the new birth then remember in
[2:03:47] the inner Veil brother Brenham made it
[2:03:49] part of going in behind the veil brother
[2:03:51] said what what what is he trying to do
[2:03:54] what is the new birth then he said well
[2:03:56] brother Brandon what is the new birth
[2:03:58] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:04:00] personally to you amen not you joined a
[2:04:03] church you shook hand you done something
[2:04:04] different you set a Creed you promised
[2:04:06] to live by a code of rules but Christ
[2:04:08] the Bible he is the word that was
[2:04:10] revealed to you and no matter what
[2:04:12] anybody says what takes place it's
[2:04:14] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[2:04:16] be it's Christ in you that is the
[2:04:19] Revelation that the church was built
[2:04:20] upon what Christ Christ and
[2:04:24] me that's the mystery that Paul was a
[2:04:27] steward over now we go back to this
[2:04:29] famous scripture in Matthew
[2:04:31] 16 Jesus asking his disciples who do who
[2:04:34] do men say that I am and they had
[2:04:35] answers for who men said that he was but
[2:04:38] he comes to a real good question who do
[2:04:40] you say that I am said to him but who
[2:04:43] say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[2:04:45] answered and said Thou Art Christ the
[2:04:48] son of the Living God and Jesus answered
[2:04:50] and said unto him bless out there Simon
[2:04:52] bar Jonah this is his name Simon bar
[2:04:55] Jonah Simon bar means son of
[2:04:59] Jonah the word Simon means
[2:05:02] hearer Peter had been hearing the word
[2:05:05] since he was a child amen he had been
[2:05:08] hearing his father talk about the
[2:05:09] Messiah coming he went to synagogue and
[2:05:11] heard it preached about he was a hearer
[2:05:14] yes prise God some of you young people
[2:05:16] in here you're a
[2:05:18] hearer but you need a name change
[2:05:21] amen amen nothing wrong with being a
[2:05:23] hearer but it's got to go further than a
[2:05:25] hearer amen he says he said blessed art
[2:05:28] thou Simon bar Jonah amen you're a
[2:05:31] hearer you're the son of Jonah for Flesh
[2:05:33] and Blood have not revealed unto thee
[2:05:35] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[2:05:37] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[2:05:41] what did he do he just changed his
[2:05:43] identification he said thou are Simon
[2:05:46] barjon he called him by his official
[2:05:48] birth name who he was and who his father
[2:05:50] he gave him his Earthly identification
[2:05:53] but now after receiving the Revelation
[2:05:56] he says no Flesh and Blood told you this
[2:05:58] but my Father which is heaven because
[2:06:00] you can receive Revelation from the
[2:06:02] father it means you're due a new
[2:06:04] identity and you're now
[2:06:06] Peter you know what Peter means Peter
[2:06:09] means a stone what is a stone it's a
[2:06:12] revelation Peter caught a revelation of
[2:06:14] Jesus Christ revealed personally to him
[2:06:17] and it changed his identification he's
[2:06:19] no longer here but now he's got the
[2:06:22] revelation of what he's been hearing all
[2:06:24] of his life this is the Messiah he heard
[2:06:26] about Messiah he heard about Messiah
[2:06:28] coming he longed to see the Messiah but
[2:06:31] in this in this moment of time when this
[2:06:34] Revelation strikes his soul now he
[2:06:36] realized I'm looking at what I've been
[2:06:38] hearing all my life it's standing before
[2:06:40] my
[2:06:44] eyes and now he's a stone he's got a
[2:06:48] confession he confessed his Revelation
[2:06:50] Stone brother B is a two ways there a
[2:06:52] confession and a revelation but you have
[2:06:54] to have a revelation to have a
[2:06:58] confession I also say unto thee that
[2:07:01] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll
[2:07:05] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[2:07:08] shall never Prevail against it what's
[2:07:10] the foundation stone of the church a
[2:07:13] personal revelation of who Jesus Christ
[2:07:16] is to
[2:07:18] you and it'll change your identification
[2:07:21] ation
[2:07:23] amen Peter we just been through this
[2:07:26] means a rock or a
[2:07:27] stone it originally Simon who was
[2:07:31] hearer some of us need to move from
[2:07:33] being a hearer of the message till we
[2:07:34] get that Revelation
[2:07:36] ourselves and we get our own
[2:07:42] Stone the anointed ones at the end time
[2:07:45] so these trees the True
[2:07:48] Vine the True Vine and false Vine you've
[2:07:50] heard me preach on that sense from years
[2:07:52] ago how they've growed up together
[2:07:54] brought them in individuals and showed
[2:07:55] that from Cain and Abel the two vines
[2:07:57] that met at an altar both of them
[2:07:59] religious both of them anointed both of
[2:08:01] them Desiring life and worshiping the
[2:08:03] same God this is what we heard Wednesday
[2:08:06] night brother
[2:08:08] Emanuel and one was rejected and the
[2:08:10] other
[2:08:11] received and the only way that the one
[2:08:14] was received could have done anything
[2:08:16] different from his brother it was
[2:08:18] revealed to him for the Bible said by
[2:08:21] faith
[2:08:22] Hebrews 11th chapter by faith Abel
[2:08:24] offered on God a more excellent
[2:08:25] sacrifice than that of Cain which God
[2:08:28] testifying that he was righteous Jesus
[2:08:30] said the spiritual revelation of who he
[2:08:33] was who does man say I the son of man am
[2:08:36] he said Peter said Thou Art the Christ
[2:08:38] the son of the Living God blessed out
[2:08:40] there Simon Simon son of Jonas Flesh and
[2:08:43] Blood never revealed this to you but my
[2:08:44] Father which is in heaven has revealed
[2:08:46] it Upon This Rock I'll build my Church
[2:08:50] the true Revel ation of the word there
[2:08:53] is the true vine
[2:08:55] again what identifies the True Vine amen
[2:08:58] when they can receive the revelation of
[2:09:01] the true word for the day that they're
[2:09:03] living in who Christ is today who the
[2:09:06] Messiah is now and where he is now not
[2:09:09] where he was amen they all in this day
[2:09:11] knew where he was he was in Moses he was
[2:09:13] in The Exodus Journey he was he was in
[2:09:15] Egypt doing signs and wonders they knew
[2:09:17] he was in Samuel and they knew he was in
[2:09:19] the prophets they knew he was in David
[2:09:21] they knew he was there but what Peter
[2:09:23] caught was where he was right now who
[2:09:25] this man
[2:09:26] is this Revelation this day's word made
[2:09:30] manifest what do we need today amen we
[2:09:32] need a revelation of the word today who
[2:09:35] Jesus Christ is today where he is today
[2:09:38] have we caught the opening of The Seven
[2:09:40] seal the revealing of the Mysteries the
[2:09:42] coming of the Lord the mighty Angel who
[2:09:44] could be none other than Christ himself
[2:09:45] coming with an open book in his hand to
[2:09:47] what to reveal the hidden Mana that was
[2:09:50] in the back part of God's mind so that
[2:09:52] you would have strength to find your
[2:09:53] identification so he can hand you one
[2:09:56] piece of that Revelation hallelujah amen
[2:09:59] and that piece of the Revelation would
[2:10:01] contain your true identity from the
[2:10:04] Lamb's Book of Life amen PR
[2:10:09] amen praise God said oh God let me have
[2:10:15] the
[2:10:16] stone above anything else I need this
[2:10:19] Stone I need this personal revelation of
[2:10:23] who I really
[2:10:24] am more than I need to know anything
[2:10:28] else I need to know who I am in you and
[2:10:32] what part I have do I have part in this
[2:10:36] Great White Rock that mystery that was
[2:10:38] contained in the word am I part of it or
[2:10:41] not part of it that's the rock we need
[2:10:45] Amen in that Revelation is your
[2:10:49] identification has your new name

[2:11:03] Lamb's Book of Life is bride Mrs Jesus
[2:11:06] Christ that's the title that you're
[2:11:08] registered
[2:11:12] under now he goes on and says Able by
[2:11:17] faith again in Christ is the mystery it
[2:11:19] goes right by them and they don't
[2:11:21] recognize it till it's gone it only
[2:11:23] picks up the predestinated seed that God
[2:11:25] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:11:27] the Earth the same thing came through in
[2:11:30] the days of Noah same thing came through
[2:11:32] in the days of Moses Days of Elijah days
[2:11:34] of the prophets days of Jesus on down
[2:11:36] through to this very hour the pregnated
[2:11:38] person with the seed of God the word in
[2:11:41] there manifesting itself so surrendered
[2:11:43] to the will of God that the word and the
[2:11:46] word alone manifest itself in this
[2:11:48] person The Prisoner to an IND individual
[2:11:52] not say my church now my church has
[2:11:55] nothing to do with it Hey listen now
[2:11:59] we're not talking about the Big White
[2:12:00] Rock in the pyramid anymore now we're
[2:12:02] getting down to the personal White Rock
[2:12:05] the Revelation that contains your
[2:12:07] identity listen you can look at that Big
[2:12:10] White Rock and you can listen you can be
[2:12:12] taught to repeat like a
[2:12:16] parrot and say you got the
[2:12:19] Revelation I don't say that to me mean
[2:12:21] or judgmental but just because you can
[2:12:24] repeat what you heard preach over a pull
[2:12:25] pit doesn't mean you got the Revelation
[2:12:28] amen but when that Revelation strikes
[2:12:30] you it strikes you personal it gives you
[2:12:32] your identification it's one it's part
[2:12:34] of that gr that's a huge revelation of
[2:12:36] Jesus Christ it's Christ is the mystery
[2:12:38] of God revealed but guess what to the
[2:12:41] bride they each have a part of the
[2:12:42] mystery they are part of the mystery and
[2:12:44] they each get a white Ro a white stone
[2:12:47] part of that Revelation has to do with
[2:12:49] you and you you and you and you and in
[2:12:52] that Revelation is your true
[2:12:55] identification from before the
[2:12:56] foundation of the world who you really
[2:13:01] are to me that's part of the
[2:13:03] significance of the
[2:13:05] seals it's so the bride can know her
[2:13:08] true identity absolutely amen so she can
[2:13:11] rise so she can rise above the confusion
[2:13:14] in the
[2:13:17] world not say my church my church has
[2:13:20] nothing to to do with it it's an
[2:13:23] individual one person all hell is
[2:13:25] against this teaching all hell is
[2:13:27] against this truth but it is the truth
[2:13:30] Jesus never said now Peter you and John
[2:13:32] and all the rest of the people you've
[2:13:33] got the Revelation now the whole church
[2:13:35] is saved no it was to him personally I
[2:13:39] say unto thee thee not them to thee Thou
[2:13:42] Art Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my
[2:13:44] church and the word Peter means stone
[2:13:46] stone means the confessed one or the
[2:13:48] separated one Upon A Certain Stone Upon
[2:13:51] A Certain thing see I called out the
[2:13:53] church called out upon this this Stone
[2:13:56] upon this Revelation Flesh and Blood
[2:13:58] never revealed it to you but upon this
[2:14:01] Revelation called out group I'll build
[2:14:03] my church in them and all the gates of
[2:14:06] hell will never be able to withstand
[2:14:10] it listen why won't the Gates of Hell be
[2:14:13] able to withstand it oh we got a good
[2:14:16] lesson with Alistair was here amen why
[2:14:18] because the Gates of Hell have been
[2:14:20] defeating the people people of God by
[2:14:22] propagating
[2:14:24] lies what was prevailing the LIE the
[2:14:27] hybridizing word what won in the Garden
[2:14:30] of Eden what caused Satan to win the
[2:14:32] battle is because he lied to Eve and she
[2:14:35] took the LIE what happened in every
[2:14:37] denomination they accepted the LIE what
[2:14:39] happened in every failure down through
[2:14:41] the church I mean down through time it
[2:14:43] was the LIE amen how has the kingdom of
[2:14:46] Satan been overcoming the Believers it's
[2:14:48] because they propagate their lies their
[2:14:51] false Notions they're false doctrines
[2:14:53] they're false teachings humanism mixed
[2:14:55] with the things of God hybridized word
[2:14:57] has been bringing the defeat of God's
[2:14:59] elect all through time but in the end
[2:15:01] time God has taken the veil off the
[2:15:03] entire Bible he's restored all the loose
[2:15:06] s all the doctrines that had gotten lost
[2:15:08] he brought all the truth back and then
[2:15:10] he peeled the veil off the whole thing
[2:15:12] and said it has everything to do with
[2:15:14] Christ in you the hope of glory and now
[2:15:16] God is going to finish the work by
[2:15:18] finishing it in you by giving you the
[2:15:20] true revelation of the true word so the
[2:15:22] Gates of Hell have no chance of
[2:15:24] defeating you because he can't lie to
[2:15:27] you because you know the
[2:15:28] [Applause]
[2:15:30] truth he can only defeat You by a lie he
[2:15:34] can't grab you and twist you in a knot
[2:15:36] and throw he can't do anything
[2:15:38] physically to you he can only defeat You
[2:15:40] by a
[2:15:43] lie and God has taken the veil he's
[2:15:46] revealed the entire word
[2:15:49] amen amen and upon this Revelation
[2:15:52] praise God to an
[2:15:55] individual I will build my church in
[2:15:58] them and the Gates of Hell shall never
[2:16:01] Prevail over them amen why because
[2:16:04] anybody who brings an idea you say
[2:16:06] that's not what the prophet
[2:16:08] said that's not what the Bible says
[2:16:11] that's not in the word that's different
[2:16:13] than the word amen I reject it what have
[2:16:15] you just done the Gates of Hell could
[2:16:17] not Prevail against you why cuz you
[2:16:19] stood behind the wall of the reveal word
[2:16:21] for this day what Eve failed to do in
[2:16:23] the beginning this bride's not going to
[2:16:25] fail she's predestinated not to fail
[2:16:27] she'll stick with thus sayith the Lord
[2:16:29] this is what a prophet brought this is
[2:16:31] the revelation of the word this is the
[2:16:33] Divine the perfect interpretation with
[2:16:35] Divine Vindication I don't need your IDE
[2:16:37] or slam I'll stay right
[2:16:42] here praise be to God and maybe you're
[2:16:46] right somebody comes with another idea
[2:16:49] Hey listen maybe you're right but until
[2:16:51] he reveals it to me I'm not leaving this
[2:16:55] wall you may be right that may be true
[2:16:58] what you're preaching may be dead on
[2:17:00] Amen but I'm not going to follow you I'm
[2:17:02] going to follow the word and until he
[2:17:04] reveals the same thing to me I'm staying
[2:17:07] put
[2:17:08] amen amen there's nothing wrong with
[2:17:11] that when brother brenon preached the
[2:17:12] seals he says you're not getting it
[2:17:13] you're not supposed to get it he said
[2:17:15] don't try to interpret it if God wants
[2:17:18] you to know anything he'll reveal it to
[2:17:22] you don't follow I don't care who it is
[2:17:25] I don't care how sound they are How
[2:17:27] doctrinally Sound how much how long
[2:17:30] they've been in the message and how they
[2:17:31] can tie everything together don't you
[2:17:33] dare follow a man you follow the
[2:17:36] word and that man and especially if he's
[2:17:39] a true minister of God he may be
[2:17:41] teaching you exactly what's in the word
[2:17:43] but you stay behind the safety of the
[2:17:45] Revelation God's given you until God
[2:17:47] opens your eyes to see it
[2:17:51] amen don't discount it it may be true
[2:17:54] but don't chase it either until God
[2:17:56] reveals it to
[2:17:59] you we'll find ourselves derailed
[2:18:06] somewhere upon this Revelation called
[2:18:09] out group I'll build my church in them
[2:18:12] and the Gates of Hell will not be able
[2:18:15] to withand it
[2:18:19] listen brother B says she'll be a super
[2:18:22] Church a super
[2:18:23] race sometimes we get the wrong
[2:18:26] idea and somehow all of a sudden we
[2:18:28] become super powerful and we become
[2:18:30] superheroes and we just go and do this
[2:18:32] and denounce that and call this
[2:18:36] and listen it's never our power it's
[2:18:39] always his power in
[2:18:41] us to be a super church is to be the one
[2:18:45] who stays with the
[2:18:47] word and who says I don't really know
[2:18:50] that sounds interesting but this is all
[2:18:52] I know is what the prophet brought so
[2:18:53] I'll stay
[2:18:55] here humility surrender submission is a
[2:19:00] super church is a super race because
[2:19:03] that's where the woman failed every time
[2:19:05] in the Bible through surrender
[2:19:07] submission and
[2:19:09] humility sometimes we get the wrong idea
[2:19:12] of what the bride's supposed to be in
[2:19:13] the end
[2:19:14] time she's supposed to be a vessel
[2:19:16] completely surrendered to the will of
[2:19:18] God and if God does anything through her
[2:19:20] to be his strength manifesting through
[2:19:22] her not
[2:19:26] hers he goes on and says not one hair of
[2:19:29] your head Shall Perish you are mine I'll
[2:19:31] raise you up in the last day give unto
[2:19:32] him eternal life and raise him up at the
[2:19:34] last days there it is the Revelation not
[2:19:38] them but him an individual not a group
[2:19:40] an individual all hell is against it
[2:19:45] what is all hell against all hell is
[2:19:47] against you getting a white stone with
[2:19:49] your true name in it amen all hell is
[2:19:51] against you getting your own personal
[2:19:53] revelation of who you are in this
[2:19:55] mystery of the end time and who you were
[2:19:58] before the foundation of the world and
[2:19:59] what's your purpose here and you
[2:20:01] surrendering to that and finding out
[2:20:02] that your M Jesus Christ individually
[2:20:05] not a group
[2:20:07] individually all hell is against that
[2:20:11] teaching praise
[2:20:14] God now I want to come and finish with
[2:20:17] this one thought
[2:20:22] remember that several I don't remember
[2:20:25] how long ago months ago I don't know
[2:20:26] maybe a year ago maybe more we talked
[2:20:29] about Sarah and Abraham how there was a
[2:20:32] prophecy in Abraham's life that he shall
[2:20:34] have a son and that son shall be the
[2:20:36] promise shall be in that son and that
[2:20:38] son shall be Isaac and you remember how
[2:20:41] that that there was some doubt on
[2:20:43] Sarah's part and she she came up with
[2:20:45] the scheme of Hagar and and in the legal
[2:20:47] way and and Justified the actions that
[2:20:50] come up with than ishmail
[2:20:52] yes we found when we looked at when we
[2:20:55] looked back at that the the the
[2:20:57] scripture says in Hebrews 11 that
[2:21:00] Abraham grew stronger in the faith as
[2:21:03] time went on he didn't grow weaker he
[2:21:05] was perfect in faith he believed what
[2:21:07] God told him and it was imputed unto him
[2:21:09] for righteousness he didn't always
[2:21:11] understand it but he believed
[2:21:13] it the problem then wasn't in
[2:21:17] Abraham anymore the problem was in Sarah
[2:21:21] because she didn't
[2:21:23] believe and it wasn't that she didn't
[2:21:25] believe the
[2:21:26] promise she wasn't struggling to believe
[2:21:29] that Abraham would have a son and that
[2:21:31] what God Said was true the part she was
[2:21:34] struggling with was her
[2:21:36] part in the
[2:21:38] prophecy that's why she could distract
[2:21:42] uh uh separate herself from the prophecy
[2:21:44] and said here take my handmade and
[2:21:46] there's a legal way which which we can
[2:21:48] bring you seed maybe God will do it this
[2:21:50] way amen and what what the reason it was
[2:21:53] off the word is because Sarah wasn't
[2:21:55] part of
[2:21:56] it it was
[2:21:58] wrong so when it comes down to it
[2:22:01] Abraham was believing Abraham was
[2:22:03] believing but now in the in the plains
[2:22:05] of memmory when God comes in flesh which
[2:22:07] denotes the end time when God comes in
[2:22:10] flesh and discerns the thoughts behind
[2:22:11] it that's exactly what God did in this
[2:22:13] generation when he came through a
[2:22:15] prophetic Ministry of William brand and
[2:22:16] turned his back to the crowd and
[2:22:17] discerned the thoughts amen behind him
[2:22:20] he showing that we're at the same time
[2:22:22] this is the same marker now Abraham and
[2:22:24] Sarah get a new name new identification
[2:22:27] they're going to get new bodies amen
[2:22:29] what it means they're going to be
[2:22:29] resurrected back to their condition in
[2:22:31] their early marriage we're going back to
[2:22:33] the church we were at Pentecost the
[2:22:35] words come back the brides come back
[2:22:38] am but yet Sarah now with a restored
[2:22:43] identity and a restored body amen coming
[2:22:45] back she's still not
[2:22:49] conceiving amen
[2:22:51] the listen the problem's not in
[2:22:55] Abraham the problem's not with
[2:22:58] God the problems with
[2:23:03] Sarah look at what Hebrew
[2:23:06] says through faith also Sarah herself
[2:23:11] received strength to conceive
[2:23:13] seed and was delivered of a child when
[2:23:16] she was past age because she judged him
[2:23:18] faithful who had promised
[2:23:21] this was all hinging on Sarah receiving
[2:23:27] Faith Abraham's seed was restored his
[2:23:30] youthfulness restored her youth was
[2:23:32] restored they went back to the condition
[2:23:34] they were when he was a young man she
[2:23:35] was a young woman he was viral in the
[2:23:37] beginning he was able to produce he
[2:23:39] produced an ishmail amen and it was her
[2:23:43] who could never conceive amen now she's
[2:23:45] turned back young she's got a young body
[2:23:47] he's turned back into potency again amen
[2:23:50] they they've got all that it takes now
[2:23:52] now God doesn't have to work on Abraham
[2:23:55] anymore to fulfill the promise now he's
[2:23:58] got to do something to Sarah's Faith now
[2:24:01] it's hinged on Sarah's Faith because
[2:24:04] Sarah is part of Abraham so that makes
[2:24:07] her part of the prophecy meaning she's
[2:24:09] part of the word she's part of the
[2:24:12] mystery and because she's part of the
[2:24:15] mystery she has to have faith too not
[2:24:18] just Abraham's Faith she must believe
[2:24:21] and when that when her faith comes it
[2:24:23] says here in Hebrews through faith also
[2:24:25] Sarah
[2:24:28] herself receive strength not to be made
[2:24:31] young to conceive
[2:24:34] seed what do we need we need a
[2:24:36] revelation of our part of the
[2:24:41] mystery Genesis
[2:24:44] 21 and the Lord visited Sarah
[2:24:50] listen there before this there was seven
[2:24:53] times that he visited Abraham Vis
[2:24:55] Abraham changed his name to Abraham he
[2:24:57] visited him seven times the seventh time
[2:24:59] was the plains of memory because in the
[2:25:01] seventh age God would come in flesh and
[2:25:03] discern the thoughts behind
[2:25:05] him amen and we discern Sarah and now
[2:25:08] the serment would work on her and and
[2:25:10] she's the bride and now the all of this
[2:25:12] is transpiring but but he promised
[2:25:15] Abraham that I will visit you again in
[2:25:18] the appointed time in the appointed
[2:25:19] season I'll visit you you again but you
[2:25:21] read through your Bible there's never a
[2:25:23] time that we find God coming and
[2:25:25] visiting Abraham again the next
[2:25:27] visitation is this one in Genesis 21
[2:25:30] when the Lord visited Sarah what did
[2:25:32] Sarah need Sarah needed a personal
[2:25:35] revelation of her part of the mystery
[2:25:37] before it was Abraham Abraham Abraham
[2:25:39] Abraham she was no doubt hearing what
[2:25:41] God told Abraham hearing the prophecy
[2:25:44] through Abraham and Abraham no doubt
[2:25:45] told her but until she came in contact
[2:25:48] with a living God herself in a private
[2:25:51] visitation listen there's no record of
[2:25:53] what happened and the Lord visited Sarah
[2:25:55] as he had said and the Lord did unto
[2:25:57] Sarah as he had spoke for Sarah
[2:25:59] conceived and bear Abraham a son in his
[2:26:01] old age what happened in this meeting I
[2:26:04] don't know what happened in this meeting
[2:26:05] it was Private there's nothing written
[2:26:07] about it but the Lord visited Sarah and
[2:26:10] then we pick it up in Hebrews and Sarah
[2:26:13] herself by faith Sarah herself receiv
[2:26:16] received strength
[2:26:20] God has done everything he needs to do
[2:26:22] in the end time he has sent a prophet he
[2:26:24] sent his word he's revealed The Mystery
[2:26:26] of the seven Thunders he's took the cap
[2:26:28] off of it he's revealed the unwritten
[2:26:30] word he's changed your name to bride
[2:26:32] he's told your identification as Mrs
[2:26:34] Jesus Christ but you know what we need
[2:26:36] we need an individual meeting in private
[2:26:38] with a living God who will come down and
[2:26:40] confirm you're part of this mystery
[2:26:43] you're part of Christ this message has
[2:26:45] to do with you you're part of that White
[2:26:48] Rock inside the Rock amen and here's
[2:26:51] your portion of white stone and in this
[2:26:53] stone is your
[2:26:56] identification revelation of who you are
[2:27:01] in Christ amen seed Gene of God
[2:27:04] revelation of who you've always been who
[2:27:07] you're always meant to be and in this
[2:27:10] Revelation is your
[2:27:14] identification what did the seven
[2:27:16] Thunders come to
[2:27:18] do to give Grace for rapturing
[2:27:21] Faith the seven Thunders the revealing
[2:27:23] of the seven Thunders the opening of The
[2:27:25] Seven seal came so that you and I could
[2:27:29] have faith to change these
[2:27:32] bodies you know what we need we need
[2:27:35] that White Rock that white stone we need
[2:27:39] that Revelation and we need it to give
[2:27:42] through faith give us strength to
[2:27:45] conceive on this
[2:27:48] word in wisdom vers Faith said Jesus
[2:27:51] noted by faith in the revelation of
[2:27:54] God's word in his own predestinated life
[2:27:57] Glory I hope that soaks Plumb to your
[2:27:59] heart Jesus knew who he was Satan was
[2:28:03] wondering he knowed that he was a
[2:28:06] predestinated creature of God and that
[2:28:08] God himself was manifesting in him it
[2:28:10] wasn't him doing the works it was the
[2:28:12] father that dwelt in
[2:28:17] him listen Satan was wondering Satan
[2:28:20] wasn't so sure who this was he was
[2:28:22] meeting in the wilderness but Jesus knew
[2:28:24] who he was and because Jesus knew who he
[2:28:27] was Satan could not overpower him in the
[2:28:29] Temptation in the wilderness why because
[2:28:30] he knew who he
[2:28:31] was how did he know who he was he just
[2:28:34] had a personal encounter with a living
[2:28:36] God at Jordan am and the Holy Ghost came
[2:28:39] upon him and he knew who he was this is
[2:28:41] my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased
[2:28:43] now he goes from there he goes straight
[2:28:45] to Jordan and he goes straight to the
[2:28:48] Wilderness in the wilderness the Devil
[2:28:49] comes to the devil's wondering could
[2:28:51] this be that son could this be Messiah
[2:28:53] but Jesus wasn't wondering he knew who
[2:28:55] he was and because he knew who he was
[2:28:57] Satan couldn't defeat him with the
[2:29:04] Temptation Jesus knew it by experience
[2:29:07] he knowed it by Revelation he know that
[2:29:09] he was that Son of God that was to come
[2:29:11] into the world he knowed his standing he
[2:29:13] knowed he was born in this world for
[2:29:15] that purpose and that's the reason the
[2:29:17] word of God could work through him
[2:29:19] because he knows what he
[2:29:21] was you realize the power of a personal
[2:29:24] revelation of who you are in Christ it
[2:29:26] can't be group Revelation because in
[2:29:28] group Revelation won't work in your
[2:29:30] private
[2:29:31] Temptation being part of the truth in a
[2:29:34] group won't work when the Temptation
[2:29:35] comes to you when you're alone when the
[2:29:38] Mind battle comes to you when the
[2:29:39] Temptation isolates you in the
[2:29:41] wilderness and you're all by yourself
[2:29:43] it's going to take more than just I'm
[2:29:45] part of the Bride I'm one no it's not
[2:29:47] that you have to have a white Rock
[2:29:49] placed in your your hand carry it in
[2:29:51] your pocket all the time so that if you
[2:29:52] ever get confused and beat up and beat
[2:29:55] down and wondering what's upside and
[2:29:56] down you can take out that right Rock
[2:29:58] and in that rock is your identification
[2:30:02] say no Satan I don't need your lie I
[2:30:04] don't need your Temptation I'm a Child
[2:30:06] of
[2:30:07] [Music]
[2:30:08] God Don't Throw That Rock down there's
[2:30:11] nothing written on it why because it's
[2:30:13] written in the table of your heart who
[2:30:15] you really are the Revelation comes to
[2:30:17] the inner chamber keep it in your pocket
[2:30:19] friend
[2:30:21] the White Rock and you can show it to
[2:30:25] everybody and they have no idea what it
[2:30:28] means cuz nobody else knows the name
[2:30:31] that's in the Rock except he who's
[2:30:33] received the
[2:30:36] rock it's a private revelation of who
[2:30:39] you are in
[2:30:43] Christ 1 Peter 26 and 7 wherefore also
[2:30:47] it is contained in the scripture behold
[2:30:50] I lay in Zion in a Chief
[2:30:52] Cornerstone elect precious he that
[2:30:55] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[2:30:58] unto you therefore which believe he is
[2:31:00] precious but unto them which be
[2:31:02] disobedient the stone which the builders
[2:31:03] disallowed the same is made the head of
[2:31:06] the
[2:31:07] corner Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago God
[2:31:11] made flesh was the word made flesh that
[2:31:14] bled and died for us he was the
[2:31:15] Cornerstone that the church has built on
[2:31:18] but he's also the cap in off at the end
[2:31:21] time the Cornerstone the head of the
[2:31:23] corner the the the Cornerstone has
[2:31:26] become the head of the corner he's
[2:31:28] become the Capstone to cap off his
[2:31:31] bride and we can quote things and say
[2:31:34] things and and repeat
[2:31:36] things but what's going to give us the
[2:31:39] victory that Jesus had is when we have
[2:31:41] the revelation of who we are like Jesus
[2:31:44] said there's been a there's been a
[2:31:47] tremendous Revelation laying in this
[2:31:49] Bible
[2:31:50] that's been given to us in the end time
[2:31:52] the veil's been taken away it was sealed
[2:31:55] up with Seven Seals wrapped around it
[2:31:57] but they've been peeled off and it's
[2:31:59] been opened up and now we see Christ in
[2:32:01] every verse and every line and every
[2:32:02] character amen
[2:32:07] amen that's
[2:32:09] great but what I
[2:32:12] need I need to overcome leod
[2:32:15] deia and I need from God to give me a
[2:32:18] White Rock
[2:32:20] and in that rock I need my name the same
[2:32:25] name that's written in the Lamb's Book
[2:32:26] of Life mrss Jesus
[2:32:30] Christ oh I thank God I don't know about
[2:32:33] you but if I feel around in my heart I
[2:32:35] can feel that
[2:32:36] rock has God given you a White Rock with
[2:32:39] your name in it has God given you a
[2:32:41] revelation listen friends if there's if
[2:32:44] you're in doubt if you don't know just
[2:32:46] ask him just say God I need a revelation
[2:32:49] I need you to Quicken this to
[2:32:51] me I can see it I can identify with it I
[2:32:54] can recognize that some of these these
[2:32:56] things are true and I I have no
[2:32:58] objection to brother Brandon being a
[2:33:00] prophet I have no objection to the truth
[2:33:02] but I keep failing in my Wilderness
[2:33:05] Temptation I keep falling I can't I seem
[2:33:08] to have no strength to stand God I need
[2:33:11] you to give me what Jesus had when he
[2:33:13] went to the
[2:33:14] Wilderness I need the baptism of the
[2:33:16] Holy Ghost I need a meeting I need what
[2:33:18] Sarah had when she received strength to
[2:33:20] conceive
[2:33:21] seed I need a my Genesis 21
[2:33:26] encounter I need Lord you to come to me
[2:33:30] and the Lord visited
[2:33:34] Sarah and he did unto her as he had
[2:33:37] promised God come to me and do unto me
[2:33:42] as you has
[2:33:43] promised what's he looking for is and
[2:33:47] he's not looking for accolades and Mar
[2:33:50] and he's looking for a
[2:33:53] surrender he's looking for somebody
[2:33:55] who'll just say I'm tired of my way
[2:33:58] tired of my thinking I'm tired of
[2:34:01] sitting on the fence I'm tired of
[2:34:02] playing around with the world I'm tired
[2:34:04] of trying to have two worlds at the same
[2:34:06] time I'm tired of
[2:34:08] it what I want is to dive into this
[2:34:12] White Rock and get lost in this
[2:34:13] Revelation and have him drop in my hand
[2:34:17] a white
[2:34:18] stone with the identification of who I
[2:34:22] am listen if he reveals to you who you
[2:34:25] are it'll change your whole life am amen
[2:34:29] it's not a church walk churches try
[2:34:32] Reformation we try to conform people and
[2:34:34] we all have a standard and we all live
[2:34:35] by the standard we all do the same thing
[2:34:37] listen that's not going to work so well
[2:34:39] I mean that may only work when you're
[2:34:40] around people or that only may work if
[2:34:42] you're embarrassed about getting caught
[2:34:43] doing something wrong but that's not
[2:34:45] going to work on the back side of the
[2:34:46] desert when he whispers in your ear
[2:34:48] alone
[2:34:49] yes it's going to take something more
[2:34:52] than that it's going to take a direct
[2:34:54] Revelation from the father of who Jesus
[2:34:56] Christ is today and who I am as part of
[2:34:59] that
[2:35:01] mystery Lord give us the white
[2:35:04] stone that has in
[2:35:07] it our new name amen I need to know
[2:35:11] brother BR said when he come to this
[2:35:13] last service he preached communion he
[2:35:14] said it was a wonderful day when I
[2:35:16] realized I wasn't the son of Charles and
[2:35:18] Ella brandham but I was a Son of God
[2:35:22] what did he get he got a White Rock with
[2:35:24] his name in it he knew who he really was
[2:35:27] hey what a glorious day for us to
[2:35:29] realize this flesh stuff has nothing to
[2:35:31] do with it this is temporal to serve a
[2:35:33] purpose that God has it'll one day be
[2:35:35] all change some of it trips me up some
[2:35:37] of it blesses me but overall it's a
[2:35:41] handicap but praise God that's not what
[2:35:44] I'm looking at he's given me something
[2:35:45] else in my heart a true identification
[2:35:48] when he says I'll no longer call I'll
[2:35:49] call you church I'll call you bride I
[2:35:51] say he's talking to me when he says when
[2:35:53] you leave these names and you leave
[2:35:55] these titles of churches and you come
[2:35:56] back to being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:35:58] you'll be Mrs Jesus Christ and something
[2:36:00] in me says that's me mama that's me he's
[2:36:03] talking about I'm part of that I was in
[2:36:05] the back part of your mind I'm part of
[2:36:07] the White Rock I'm part of the mystery
[2:36:09] of God and he's given me a little
[2:36:11] portion of that Revelation so that I
[2:36:12] know my name is on the Lamb's Book of
[2:36:16] Life oh we've seen the seals open we've
[2:36:19] seen the preach of the Thunders we've
[2:36:20] seen him come and do what he promised to
[2:36:22] do in the end time but you know what
[2:36:23] John got out of that when John saw him
[2:36:26] take the book John realized I must John
[2:36:29] must have saw his name in that that's
[2:36:31] what he started dancing and shouting it
[2:36:33] wasn't just because the lamb took the
[2:36:35] book but brother brandham gives us a
[2:36:36] little insight it wasn't just because
[2:36:38] the lamb took the book but it's because
[2:36:41] he saw his name in the book that he was
[2:36:43] rejoicing when the lamb took the
[2:36:46] book you know it'll cause you to be
[2:36:49] thrilled at preaching about the Seven
[2:36:51] Seals about the Thunders about the
[2:36:53] opening of the word about the coming
[2:36:55] forth of the Bride you know what'll
[2:36:56] thrill your heart not to say oh God sent
[2:36:58] a prophet that was wonderful and now we
[2:37:00] all know the truth of the Bible what
[2:37:01] will thrill you beyond sitting in your
[2:37:03] seat and being able to contain yourself
[2:37:05] is when you recognize he's talking about
[2:37:07] me when he says bride that's me when he
[2:37:09] says wife that's me when he says Mrs
[2:37:11] Jesus Christ that's me that's when you
[2:37:13] can't hold it in any longer friends when
[2:37:16] you recognize he's talking about me
[2:37:21] amen praise God that comes by
[2:37:24] Revelation say God grant us your
[2:37:28] Revelation amen let's all stand
[2:37:31] together oh thank you Lord
[2:37:34] Jesus musicians if you'll come and

[2:37:40] Father we thank you Lord for this day we
[2:37:42] live in God the world is wicked but I

[2:37:52] economy is failing and I don't care Oh

[2:37:57] blowing Wars are all over and natural
[2:38:00] disasters are occurring but I don't care

[2:38:06] stand in this day if you let me pick I
[2:38:09] say put me here in the very end of the
[2:38:11] last moment so that I could have a heart

[2:38:29] sisters Lord May each one have their
[2:38:33] Genesis 21 meeting with

[2:39:24] seals may they recognize the the sound
[2:39:28] of your voice as a lion
[2:39:31] roaring and recognize it as a call a
[2:39:34] lion a king calling for his Queen to
[2:39:37] come to his
[2:39:39] side Lord may they not just hear
[2:39:42] Queen but may they hear their
[2:39:45] name and the Roaring of The Lion and the
[2:39:47] sounding of the Thunders in the
[2:39:49] revealing of the
