[0:00] luke 13 10 and when he was teaching in
[0:03] one of the synagogues on the sabbath
[0:05] and behold there was a woman which had a
[0:07] spirit of infirmity 18 years
[0:09] and was bowed together and could in no
[0:12] wise lift up herself
[0:14] so she is crippled she has bowed over
[0:17] like
[0:18] like hunched back there curled over
[0:21] and bowed over and she could in no way
[0:23] straighten herself up she is she
[0:25] this is a crippled woman
[0:26] who's bowed over in the back and could
[0:28] not raise herself
[0:31] and could in no wise lift up herself and
[0:33] when jesus saw her he called to her
[0:36] he called her to him and said unto her
[0:38] woman thou
[0:39] art loosed from thine infirmity and he
[0:41] said
[0:42] and he laid his hand on her and
[0:44] immediately she was made straight and
[0:46] glorified god
[0:49] what i like about this is in verse 11
[0:53] there was a woman which had a spirit of
[0:56] infirmity
[1:00] she did not have a crippled body
[1:04] that was a spirit of infirmity that was
[1:07] reflecting in a crippled body
[1:12] you understand you understand what i'm
[1:14] trying to say
[1:15] we would look at that and say that poor
[1:17] woman she was probably born a
[1:18] she's probably a hunchback
[1:20] she's bowed over her spine is probably
[1:22] deformed i mean she
[1:23] she may she may have been disfigured she
[1:25] may have been in that condition so long
[1:27] her muscles have have molded to that
[1:29] position and she could not even raise
[1:31] herself
[1:31] up and we look at that as a physical
[1:33] condition and that is not a physical
[1:35] condition
[1:36] that is a spiritual infirmity and i'll
[1:40] tell you why that is amazing
[1:42] the reason that's amazing is because he
[1:44] hath made us kings and priests and we're
[1:46] kings over a
[1:47] spiritual dominion over a spiritual
[1:49] kingdom we're spiritual kings and
[1:52] priests and if that's a spiritual
[1:53] affirmative
[1:54] infirmity we have the power and the
[1:56] spiritual realm to exercise
[1:58] our dominion as a king and a priest over
[2:00] the spiritual realm
[2:01] and cast that thing out and reject that
[2:04] and let it go
[2:05] and not worry about how the muscles will
[2:06] work and how the spine will come back
[2:08] and there's not hopeless it's not
[2:10] helpless it's not because there's kings
[2:12] and priests on this earth
[2:14] spiritual kings and priests over a
[2:16] spiritual kingdom
[2:17] now not will be but he hath already made
[2:20] us kings and priests
