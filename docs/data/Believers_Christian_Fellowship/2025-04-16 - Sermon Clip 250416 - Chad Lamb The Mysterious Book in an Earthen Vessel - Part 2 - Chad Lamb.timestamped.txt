[0:00] Again, Christ is the mystery of God
[0:02] revealed. Now, you see the seals when he
[0:04] was in his mediator work back there
[0:06] redeeming, but someday he comes forth to
[0:07] get this book that he's redeemed. And
[0:09] all that's in the book would be him. For
[0:12] that's the believer. The word's in the
[0:14] book. And the word is him. Amen. So
[0:17] everything that's in this book is what?
[0:21] Christ. Yeah. Because Christ is the
[0:23] mystery of God revealed. Yeah. But what
[0:26] are you? Yeah, I'm one of the words in
[0:29] the book.
[0:31] So there's my name. I'm part of the
[0:34] book. But the book is Christ, which
[0:36] means I'm part of Christ. And Christ is
[0:38] the revelation, the mystery of God
[0:40] revealed. That means I'm part of God.
[0:41] I'm part of the revelation of God. I'm
[0:43] part of Christ. And Christ is the book.
[0:45] And the believer's words in the book.
[0:46] I'm part of the book, part of Christ.
[0:48] Part of the revelation of God's great
[0:50] mystery.
[0:51] The seventh seal. The seventh seal is
[0:54] not something I believe. The seventh
[0:56] seal is something I'm part of,
[0:58] manifesting, expressing on this earth.
[1:00] It's not a belief. It's a manifestation.
[1:02] It's not a belief. It's a person. It's
[1:04] God himself coming and manifesting
[1:07] himself through Christ through the
[1:09] anointing of Christ upon a people on the
[1:11] earth to manifest the bride form of
[1:12] Jesus Christ. It's not a doctrine. It's
[1:15] not a teaching. It's not a belief. It's
[1:17] a manifestation of a life. That's the
[1:20] seventh seal.
[1:24] Praise God.
[1:25] Now, does it matter if you lose your job
[1:27] tomorrow? It doesn't matter if you lose
[1:29] your job tomorrow. Will your flesh
[1:31] suffer? Sure, it will suffer. But what
[1:32] does it matter? I saw my name in the
[1:34] book. The book that's been from before
[1:36] the foundation of the world. Amen. What
[1:38] does it matter? Everything's secure. If
[1:41] something happens to me, it's only
[1:42] because God wants to express some of his
[1:45] word through me.
[1:48] This revelation is the revelation that
[1:51] gives the bride faith to take her
[1:53] position. Yeah. This is the revelation
[1:55] that will eventually give her faith to
[1:57] take a body change because she
[1:59] recognizes what she really is, what her
[2:02] substance is, what she's part of, and
[2:05] why she's here.
