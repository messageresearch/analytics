[0:00] we we we all uh want to uh do a little
[0:04] tweak here and we know uh because we
[0:08] like it our way is that right but but
[0:11] God has called us to take what has been
[0:16] corrupted and to have a true
[0:19] restoration that it goes back to the
[0:22] original amen right we don't want to add
[0:25] that one thing to it we we don't even
[0:27] want to put the fuzzy dice on the mirror
[0:30] right we want it original amen just like
[0:33] it came from the factory and and you
[0:36] know we we we we think of this and and
[0:39] in this message there there's so many uh
[0:42] offshoots and so many uh ideas and and
[0:46] and there's so many different fandangled
[0:48] things but I I love what the prophet
[0:50] said uh in a a man running from the
[0:53] presence of the Lord he he he took the
[0:55] Mysteries and he made it so real brother
[0:59] bam says he
[1:00] says in uh man running from the presence
[1:03] of the Lord he says now watch what he
[1:05] says may all the great Mysteries that we
[1:09] are supposed to know at this age Lord be
[1:11] unveiled to
[1:13] us amen and will see the plainness of
[1:17] God Amen so so the revelations ought to
[1:22] make
[1:24] what Christ plain to
[1:26] us so so if we have a revel ation of
[1:31] complication that's not the
[1:34] Mysteries but but the revelations are to
[1:37] bring plainness of
[1:40] Christ but but watch what he says he
[1:42] says so that we'll
[1:45] know what's the mystery supposed to
[1:48] do right so that we'll know how to
[1:53] behave
[1:56] ourselves
[1:58] sir and act
[2:01] correcting
[2:05] ourselves and bringing the members of
[2:10] our body into discipline to the word
[2:14] that we might know how to live in this
[2:17] present day at the approaching of the
[2:20] Lord Jesus so in this message in this
[2:25] seven seal book of redemption that's
[2:28] been Loos to us in this day
[2:32] yes it ought to bring
[2:37] plainness and it ought to bring us to a
[2:42] realization of the incorrect parts of
[2:45] our
[2:48] body and it ought to bring our members
[2:51] of our body into discipline to God's
[2:56] word
[2:57] amen and and if that message brings
[3:01] anything else we're looking at it
[3:06] wrong you know we we all want the
[3:10] Mysteries but but really in essence we
[3:13] ought to look and say what are the
[3:15] Mysteries doing for
[3:17] me where am I at in my Christian
[3:21] experience and and and and if it's in a
[3:24] and and if we're falling short then then
[3:26] maybe we need to real maybe we need to
[3:28] take a second look and go wait a minute
[3:29] minute maybe I don't see the Mysteries
[3:32] like I
[3:33] should
