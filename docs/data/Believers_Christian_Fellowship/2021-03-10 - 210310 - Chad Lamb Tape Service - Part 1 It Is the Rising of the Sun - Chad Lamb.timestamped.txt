[0:00] oh we're a band of christian soldiers
[0:03] fighting satan every day
[0:05] we're standing up for jesus while we're
[0:08] kneeling down to pray

[0:27] i've been washed in that soul cleansing
[0:31] blood of the land i was bound by chains

[2:01] that is in me
[2:04] greater is he that is
[2:09] greater is he that is in me
[2:12] than he that is in the world
[2:17] well satan's like a roaring lion
[2:22] roaming to and from
[2:26] seeking who he may devour
[2:30] the bible tells me so
[2:35] many souls have been his
[2:38] prey to fall in some weekend
[2:44] but god has given us today
[2:48] his overcoming power
[2:52] oh greater is he that
[3:03] that is in me than he that is
[3:07] in the world and on
[3:11] that day of pentecost
[3:15] a rushing mighty way
[3:19] blew into the upper room
[3:23] and baptized all of them
[3:28] with the power greater than
[3:32] any earthly food
[3:36] and i'm so glad i've got it
[3:40] too i'm gonna let the whole world know
[3:44] well greater is he that is he that is in
[4:00] the
[4:00] world one more time
[4:17] [Music]
[4:25] [Music]
[4:30] we want to see
[4:34] [Music]
[4:41] to jesus out and touch
[4:47] [Music]
[4:50] and say that we
[4:54] love
[4:58] [Music]
[5:08] oh
[5:11] and help us
[5:26] [Music]
[5:36] see
[5:40] [Music]
[5:42] amen praise god how many came to see him
[5:46] how many expect to see him the prophet
[5:49] of god told us
[5:50] you get what you come expecting amen
[5:54] and so we want to expect to see him and
[5:56] then we're going to
[5:57] go right into our tape service now we're
[6:00] going to play this tape thank you
[6:01] musicians
[6:02] appreciate all you do for us amen um
[6:05] let's just go ahead and have our seats
[6:07] as we prepare here and prepare ourselves
[6:11] i want to make a quick note and let you
[6:13] remind all of you if you haven't
[6:15] been made aware that the time changes
[6:17] this weekend so we'll be springing
[6:18] forward
[6:19] moving our clocks up this saturday night
[6:22] and so that's always a good sign that
[6:24] warm weather is coming
[6:25] so praise the lord amen so it seems like
[6:29] just like last month we moved it back
[6:31] time's going so fast but here we are
[6:33] again
[6:34] so now we've come to this tape service
[6:36] we we've been doing this
[6:38] at least once a year for the last i
[6:40] think four years i think this is the
[6:41] fourth year we've done it
[6:43] and maybe a little wrong on that but i
[6:44] believe that's where we're at
[6:47] and the reason i started doing this
[6:48] originally and the reason i continue to
[6:50] do it
[6:51] is because we've always got uh those in
[6:53] our midst who are coming up who are
[6:55] who either who are raised in the message
[6:57] and are starting to get a hold of it for
[6:58] themselves and our youth and our
[7:00] children
[7:01] some who who are new or some who have
[7:03] just started to really committing
[7:05] themselves to the lord and
[7:06] and i do this for a couple of reasons
[7:09] one
[7:10] one reason is because i i i want to
[7:13] demonstrate to our children and to our
[7:15] young people and anybody else who can
[7:16] benefit from that
[7:18] how to really feed on the word not to
[7:20] just play a tape
[7:21] as background noise but really do how to
[7:25] dig in and glean from that message
[7:27] something that god is trying to share
[7:28] with us in this day so it's not just a
[7:30] tape that you play as
[7:32] noise in the background but it's
[7:33] actually a message god is trying to get
[7:35] to his children
[7:36] and how do we dig in and receive that
[7:38] message from the lord
[7:40] so that's one of the reasons i do that
[7:42] and i've also found that it's really
[7:44] refreshing for the whole assembly amen
[7:46] that we listen to this together because
[7:48] we we we benefit together
[7:51] being in the same place and listening to
[7:52] the same thing at the same time
[7:54] and it's really it's always been really
[7:56] refreshing for me and i've always really
[7:57] enjoyed that
[8:00] and i always want to remind you too just
[8:02] because we're playing a tape and
[8:04] following along in the book
[8:05] it doesn't mean that we have to be quiet
[8:07] amen we still want to respond to the
[8:09] word and if something strikes your heart
[8:11] shout amen
[8:12] amen praise the lord and clap your hands
[8:15] whatever
[8:15] strikes you whatever stimulation comes
[8:17] from the revelation let it be expressed
[8:20] in the way that god expresses through
[8:22] you so the the service or the message
[8:24] that we're going to take today
[8:26] is the message it is the rising of the
[8:28] sun i hope you all have a book if you
[8:30] didn't get a chance to get this book
[8:32] there's a iraq out by the welcome desk
[8:34] and the foyer
[8:35] and the deacons brother dave has some
[8:36] too and so
[8:38] if you and brother steve do you have any
[8:40] so if you need one
[8:42] and you can just raise your hand and one
[8:43] of these brothers will get you a book if
[8:44] you didn't get a chance to get one
[8:46] or they're out there you can feel free
[8:47] to slip back there and get them
[8:49] and brother drier has some as well so we
[8:51] do this i
[8:52] we order quite a few books because i
[8:55] like to follow along in the book
[8:57] my favorite way to listen to a message
[8:59] is to follow along my favorite is to
[9:01] read
[9:02] amen and to follow along with the tape
[9:05] but i do this every time i go through
[9:07] this for for all of us but especially
[9:09] for our youth
[9:10] whenever i pick up a message book
[9:12] whether it be in book form or
[9:14] or even on the tablet or on your phone
[9:16] uh and the table form the app
[9:19] what i want to know first is i want to
[9:20] know when did bro
[9:22] first i want to know the title so what
[9:25] is the title and what does this title
[9:26] mean
[9:27] and this title is it is the rising of
[9:29] the sun
[9:30] and this is amazing title because
[9:32] brother branham is not
[9:33] talking about he's not he's not phrasing
[9:36] this in past tense
[9:38] neither is he phrasing it in future
[9:40] tense but the phrasing of this message
[9:42] is in present tense
[9:44] that it is the rising of the sun and
[9:47] just by that title alone
[9:49] i start to build some anticipation in my
[9:51] heart for what he's going to say
[9:52] because this is something that's
[9:54] pertinent to me today that it
[9:56] is the rising of the sun not it will be
[9:58] or it was but it is today the rising of
[10:01] the sun
[10:02] so right away our mind goes to the right
[10:05] spot
[10:05] and anticipation begins to build in my
[10:07] heart and now i'm eager to hear what the
[10:09] prophet of god has to say
[10:11] about it is the rising of the sun then i
[10:14] look at the date and in your book it's
[10:15] in the upper left hand corner
[10:17] and it's in it's always in the format of
[10:19] year first
[10:21] then month then day so it's 65-0418
[10:25] which o4 is the month april 18th is the
[10:28] 18th day of the month
[10:29] and then there's a little m behind this
[10:30] one and that means morning that means on
[10:32] that particular sunday they had two
[10:34] messages
[10:34] this is the morning message if you're
[10:37] looking on your the table whether it be
[10:39] tablet or phone
[10:40] and you search for your title and you
[10:42] pull it up it'll be there on the left
[10:44] hand side and it will tell you the title
[10:46] it'll below that give you the date in
[10:48] the same format 65-0418-m
[10:51] to the right it will tell you the
[10:52] duration how long the message is
[10:54] and where it was preached but in the
[10:56] book if you open up
[10:58] not not to the first covered page but to
[11:00] the second page
[11:01] and on the inside of the second page in
[11:03] the small print down on the left hand
[11:04] side
[11:06] it there's there's it'll tell you that
[11:08] this is the rising of the sun
[11:10] it gives you the same format for the for
[11:12] the date but then down in the paragraph
[11:15] it says this message by brother william
[11:17] mary and branham was delivered on sunday
[11:19] morning
[11:19] april 18 1965 at the branham tabernacle
[11:23] in jeffersonville indiana usa the tape
[11:27] number 65-0418
[11:29] m is two hours and 24 minutes so i
[11:33] i this is just something i do i look at
[11:35] that i want to know how long it is i
[11:36] want to know where he preached it
[11:38] uh because because brother branham
[11:40] sometimes will change
[11:42] the way he addresses a crowd in
[11:44] different places and so i want to know
[11:45] where he's at
[11:47] and why maybe he phrases things the way
[11:49] he phrases them
[11:50] amen but when he's in jeffersonville at
[11:52] home he phrases it
[11:54] much differently sometimes i also want
[11:56] to know where in the ministry is he in
[11:58] 1965
[11:59] we know that he goes off the scene in
[12:01] the end of 1965
[12:03] so here he is at the end of his ministry
[12:05] this is after the church ages from 1960
[12:08] after the seals from 1963 and here he is
[12:11] in the on the home stretch of his
[12:13] ministry and i want to know that too so
[12:15] i want to know where it's at
[12:16] in the timeline of his ministry and the
[12:18] timeline of events
[12:19] where he preached the sermon and what
[12:22] the title of the sermon is
[12:23] and i want to hold that title in my mind
[12:26] the whole time
[12:27] so i don't want to just get it first and
[12:29] then drop it because i want to know
[12:31] that what he's preaching about is it is
[12:32] the rising of the sun
[12:34] from the beginning to the end so that's
[12:37] how we go there
[12:38] so as we usually do uh i have questions
[12:43] and so i do this so we will all stay
[12:45] tuned in as we go along because
[12:47] as we listen to the tape brother branham
[12:49] will answer all of these questions
[12:50] but i finally had an epiphany and i
[12:53] decided to put them up on a powerpoint
[12:56] so we can all read them together and i
[12:58] don't know how that hit me but somebody
[13:00] must have been praying
[13:03] because this is always the hard part i
[13:04] move too fast and you don't write fast
[13:06] enough
[13:07] so the first question is what is the
[13:09] subject
[13:10] so we know what the title is but the
[13:12] question is what is the subject and
[13:14] and brother branham will answer all of
[13:15] these and i don't
[13:17] there's no tricks here these are no
[13:18] trick questions i put them in
[13:19] chronological order as you'll come in
[13:21] contact with them
[13:22] as we listen to the message today so
[13:24] what is the subject we know the title
[13:26] but what is the subject
[13:29] next why does satan not care how
[13:31] religious you
[13:32] are or how right you are in your
[13:34] doctrine this is a good one
[13:37] why does satan not care how religious
[13:40] you are
[13:41] or how right you are in your doctrine
[13:49] i get excited just reading the questions
[13:53] why does satan not care how religious
[13:56] you are
[13:58] or how right you are in your doctrine
[14:04] number three how did brother branham get
[14:08] his text
[14:09] in his subject for this message this is
[14:12] another good one
[14:14] that i very much enjoy
[14:18] how did brother branham get his text
[14:21] and his subject for this message
[14:25] and he'll tell you very plainly
[14:38] all right number three how did brother
[14:39] branham get his text
[14:41] and his subject for this message
[14:47] all right in number four
[14:52] what does the sun son rise
[14:55] for what does the sun rise for
[15:00] or what is the purpose of the sunrise
[15:02] s-o-n
[15:03] sunrise so we'll hear that as well
[15:14] all right number four what does the sun
[15:16] rise for
[15:18] and number five what are we quickened
[15:21] from number five what
[15:25] are we quickened from
[15:29] all these are very very good brother
[15:31] brahm goes into this
[15:33] there's much more he says but these are
[15:35] just some points that i wanted to bring
[15:37] out and that we can follow along on so
[15:38] number five
[15:39] what are we quick and from now if you
[15:41] open your book or you turn on your
[15:42] tablet
[15:43] your phone we're going to begin right
[15:44] for paragraph one and brother ben right
[15:47] out the
[15:47] onset here he gets into some good stuff
[15:49] and we want to start from paragraph one
[15:52] but if you will take your bibles i want
[15:53] to go ahead and read the
[15:55] the scriptures that brother benham reads
[15:57] to to
[15:58] form the basis for this message and i'm
[16:01] going to go ahead and do that now
[16:02] because as you're following along the
[16:03] book sometimes it's hard to put the book
[16:05] down and pick your bible up
[16:06] and the scriptures written in the
[16:09] message as well but i want to
[16:10] take some time and just look at it first
[16:12] revelation chapter one
[16:14] is going to be the first scripture that
[16:15] he goes to when he opens
[16:17] this message revelation chapter one
[16:20] we're going to read three places in our
[16:22] scriptures
[16:25] revelation chapter 1 and verse 17
[16:29] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[16:32] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[16:34] saying unto me fear not
[16:36] i am the first and the last i am he that
[16:38] liveth and was dead
[16:40] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[16:43] and have the keys of hell and of death
[16:46] now let's turn to romans chapter 8.
[16:55] during romans chapter 8 and we're going
[16:57] to read one scripture here and that's
[16:59] verse
[16:59] 11. romans chapter 8 and verse 11
[17:04] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[17:06] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[17:08] he that raised up christ from the dead
[17:10] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[17:13] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[17:16] now let's go to mark 16. this will be
[17:20] the final one we read
[17:25] mark chapter 16.
[17:32] and in mark 16 we will start with verse
[17:36] one and read verse one and two
[17:38] mark 16 verse one and when the sabbath
[17:41] was passed mary magdalene and mary the
[17:44] mother of james and solomay
[17:46] had brought sweet spices that they may
[17:48] come and anoint him
[17:50] and very early in the morning the first
[17:52] day of the week
[17:54] they came into the sepulcher at the
[17:56] rising
[17:57] of the sun amen
[18:00] so that will be uh the scriptures that
[18:02] brother bannon will go to
[18:03] we want to go to your book or to your
[18:05] tablet whatever form you have it in
[18:07] and turn to page one we're going to
[18:08] begin right at the top of page one
[18:10] and also um brother franco has the audio
[18:14] playing but he also has the scrolling
[18:16] text
[18:16] that'll be scrolling so if you want to
[18:18] look up from your book and look at the
[18:19] screen
[18:20] you can also follow along there so at
[18:22] this time we can go ahead and
[18:24] start let us that
[18:28] head lord as we
[18:31] gather here this fine easter morning
[18:36] see the little bugs pressing
[18:39] we're way out the bees flying in and
[18:44] hitting their potion the birds singing
[18:47] like their
[18:48] hearts would burst the joy
[18:51] because there is an easter
[18:57] we believe that you raised up jesus from
[19:00] the dead
[19:01] many years ago today and we celebrate
[19:04] this memorial day
[19:08] and let there come an easter among us
[19:11] all today
[19:14] may we as disturbance understand his
[19:18] word
[19:18] that we are in his fellowship
[19:22] then and that now that we are
[19:25] risen with him and setting together in
[19:28] heavenly places
[19:30] bless the service here in the tabernacle
[19:34] and across the lands where it goes by
[19:36] this
[19:37] telephone
[19:41] heal all the sick and afflicted may it
[19:44] be an easter for them
[19:45] also and an exodus
[19:48] from sickness onto strength
[19:54] and those who are dead in sin and
[19:57] trespass
[19:58] may they live today through christ amen
[20:02] and we'll praise thee for we ask it in
[20:04] his name
[20:05] amen
[20:12] i certainly deemed this a marvelous
[20:15] privilege this morning to be back here
[20:17] in jeffersonville in indiana with
[20:21] this great congregation the church
[20:23] paxton
[20:24] standing in the round and outside in the
[20:26] lot
[20:27] ever worried to you people on the phones
[20:30] across the nation
[20:31] the beautiful morning here five o'clock
[20:34] this morning
[20:36] my little friend with a red breast flew
[20:39] up at the window and
[20:41] woke me up he might his little heart
[20:43] would burst and
[20:44] he is risen
[20:49] i've always thought that this little
[20:51] bird is being a friend to me because
[20:54] i like him as the legend about him says
[20:58] the little brown
[20:58] bird saw him suffering on the cross
[21:01] where
[21:02] sin had placed him of course the little
[21:05] bird
[21:05] had no sin he didn't have to die for the
[21:08] little bird
[21:10] but he flew into the cross and tried to
[21:13] pull the nails out
[21:14] with his little beast and he got his
[21:17] breath all red
[21:20] and that's the way i want mine too
[21:23] as this shield of trying to protect
[21:27] this glorious thing that he died for
[21:32] realizing that our time is limited here
[21:36] especially for those friends who are
[21:39] listening in by this
[21:40] telephone i would like to call
[21:44] your attention this morning to a
[21:48] a picture at some time ago
[21:51] was taken by uh the
[21:57] camera of a vision that i had here
[22:00] at the tabernacle of leaving indiana
[22:03] to arizona where i was to meet in a form
[22:07] of a pyramid
[22:08] seven angels not knowing what would
[22:11] happen
[22:13] later when i got there thinking it was
[22:15] the end of my life that no one could
[22:17] stand the blast and i'm sure all of you
[22:19] are
[22:20] acquainted with the story and
[22:23] then in slovenia canyon one morning like
[22:26] this
[22:27] while in prayer there had been a sword
[22:29] placed in my hand
[22:31] that this is the word and
[22:35] the story of the word later the angels
[22:38] appeared as was prophesied and at the
[22:41] same time
[22:42] a great cluster of light left where i
[22:45] was standing and moved
[22:48] 30 miles high in the air and around the
[22:51] circle
[22:52] like the wings of the angels and drawed
[22:55] into the skies the shape of a pyramid
[22:58] in the same constellation of angels that
[23:01] appeared
[23:04] the picture all the way from mexico as
[23:06] it moved from northern
[23:08] arizona where the holy spirit said it
[23:11] would be standing 40 miles
[23:12] northeast of tucson and it went into the
[23:15] air
[23:15] and life magazine packed the pictures a
[23:19] mystic something way in the spheres
[23:21] where there can be no
[23:23] moisture where there can be no
[23:25] evaporations of anything 30 miles high
[23:28] and 27 miles across
[23:31] and coming right up from where those
[23:34] angels were
[23:35] now they asked to know science the
[23:39] uh one of them in tucson wanted to know
[23:41] any significance but
[23:43] i didn't tell them you all do it told
[23:45] beforehand
[23:46] but it wasn't for them it was for you
[23:51] and so there he spoke to me and said
[23:56] the seven seals will be open the seven
[23:59] mystery
[24:00] seven-fold mystery of the bible has been
[24:02] closed up since the
[24:04] foundation of the world will be revealed
[24:06] and we
[24:07] yet a humble little group compared with
[24:09] all the world
[24:10] we've enjoyed these blessings uh hearing
[24:14] those
[24:14] mysteries marriage divorce serpentines
[24:18] all these different questions
[24:19] has been completely revealed to us
[24:23] not by man but by god himself let's open
[24:27] those seven mysteries
[24:28] of what the church was how it was in
[24:30] christ at the beginning
[24:32] and how it would be revealed in the last
[24:34] days and now as this went up
[24:37] we have the picture outside on the
[24:40] plaque
[24:41] but then i have the picture laying
[24:44] present here
[24:45] if you have noticed as life magazine had
[24:48] it
[24:49] but i wonder if my
[24:52] audience visible here has ever really
[24:56] looked at the picture see
[24:59] and the way it should be you remember
[25:02] i was preaching when this vision came
[25:05] upon the subject of the book of the
[25:09] revelations were
[25:10] the old judges where we seen jesus in
[25:14] revelations one when we started to open
[25:16] the seven seals of the
[25:18] or the church ages rather just prior to
[25:21] the opening of the seventh seal
[25:23] christ was standing with hair like wool
[25:27] white and i described that to you that
[25:31] the old english judges and judges of
[25:33] long ago
[25:34] when they went to the bench to be sworn
[25:37] in
[25:37] their supreme authority was given them
[25:40] they wore
[25:41] a white wig as it was over their heads
[25:44] to show their supreme
[25:45] authority well if you'll turn the
[25:49] picture like this and look
[25:51] you probably see it in the audience it's
[25:54] christ see his eyes looking here just as
[25:57] perfect as they could be
[25:59] wearing the white wig of supreme
[26:02] deity and judge of all heavens and
[26:05] herders
[26:06] can you see his eyes nose his mouth just
[26:09] turned the picture from this
[26:11] way they had it this way the way it's
[26:12] supposed to be
[26:14] and can you see it
[26:17] he is supreme judge there's none other
[26:20] but him and that is a perfect
[26:24] identification again a vindication
[26:28] of this message is the truth
[26:32] and making him not a third person but
[26:36] the only person
[26:38] with the white see the darkness faces
[26:41] beard his
[26:42] eyes and notice he's looking from him
[26:45] comes this light shining on the
[26:48] right hand side to which he's looking to
[26:51] on the cross that's where he looked to
[26:52] the right
[26:53] where he pardoned the sinner
[26:57] and the blight of his resurrection we
[27:00] still go forth in his name
[27:06] i wish this morning that i had just
[27:10] much time to stand upon these
[27:13] phenomena that's beyond any shadow of
[27:16] doubt
[27:17] been proven for the past 30 years the 35
[27:21] years
[27:21] right here at this church cut down on
[27:23] the river when that same light
[27:25] came down here in jeffersonville in 1933
[27:29] and spoke those words as john the
[27:32] baptist was sent to forerun the first
[27:34] coming of christ
[27:35] your message will forerun the second
[27:38] we're at the end times
[27:40] and we see it we wonder sometimes why it
[27:42] hasn't spread over the earth
[27:44] maybe sometimes we'll have a chance to
[27:47] explain that if god willing
[27:50] now i want you to turn in in your bible
[27:54] as we always believe that the word must
[27:57] come
[27:58] first of the reading of the word i
[27:59] always read that because
[28:01] if my words is the word of a man
[28:04] it will fail but the word of god can
[28:08] never fail now
[28:11] we're going to to read from the holy
[28:14] scriptures
[28:15] okay and we want you to turn first
[28:19] uh to um three places
[28:23] in the bible that i have chosen to read
[28:26] from
[28:27] one of them is in revelation
[28:31] the first chapter and the
[28:35] 17th and 18th verse
[28:39] this is where he appeared with his hair
[28:43] white as wool and his feet
[28:47] was like brass and then i want you also
[28:50] to get in your bibles
[28:52] romans 8 11.
[28:55] i've chosen this morning three places to
[28:58] read
[28:58] from the holy scriptures for my
[29:01] message today as the lord is placed upon
[29:04] my heart for the
[29:05] resurrection and then i want you to also
[29:10] mark 16 1 and 2.
[29:14] there i will draw my my
[29:17] context now in revelation 1
[29:21] 18 we read these words
[29:25] 17 and 18
[29:28] and when i saw him i fell at his
[29:31] feet as dead and he laid his right
[29:35] hand upon me saying unto me fear
[29:39] not for i am the first
[29:42] and the last i am he that liveth
[29:46] and was dead and behold i am alive
[29:50] forevermore
[29:52] amen and have the keys of
[29:55] death and hell
[29:58] and in romans the 8th chapter
[30:02] and 11th verse we read this
[30:06] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[30:09] jesus from the dead dwell
[30:12] in you he that raised up
[30:15] christ from the dead shall also
[30:18] quicken your mortal bodies by
[30:21] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[30:26] and now in mark the 16th chapter
[30:29] the chapter of the resurrection
[30:33] the 16th chapter the first and second
[30:36] verses
[30:40] and when the sabbath was passed mary
[30:44] magdalena the mother
[30:47] and mary the mother of james and salami
[30:51] has brought sweet spices
[30:54] that they might come and anoint him
[30:57] and very early in the morning the first
[31:00] day of the week
[31:03] they came unto the sepulcher at the
[31:06] rising
[31:07] of the sun now
[31:11] my text this morning i want to take for
[31:14] a text
[31:16] it is the rising of the sun
[31:21] and for a subject i want to use
[31:25] the quickening power
[31:30] now you know
[31:32] you perhaps have been hearing the radio
[31:36] and the different ministers speak in our
[31:40] noble brother neville this morning
[31:42] speaking his
[31:44] easter subject on the
[31:47] resurrection and
[31:51] i thought maybe i would take it a little
[31:55] different path not to be different but
[31:58] just to add
[31:59] a little more maybe in another
[32:03] angle or you the scriptures
[32:06] every angle you go with the scriptures
[32:09] it always declares jesus christ you
[32:14] cannot get away from it anyway
[32:16] it always declares him now
[32:20] as the world today in a
[32:24] a memorial service or at least in the
[32:28] united states in this side of the earth
[32:30] this morning
[32:31] and the churches and throughout uh
[32:33] celebrating
[32:35] a memorial of uh the greatest
[32:39] triumph that man ever had
[32:43] i think as a savior when he died
[32:48] or as an infant when he was born he
[32:51] could not
[32:52] have been your less being coming into
[32:55] the earth
[32:56] and when he died shortly he had sworn
[32:59] for our sins
[33:01] but yet there's been many
[33:04] fine little babies born
[33:07] and there's been many man who has
[33:10] suffered and died for a real cause
[33:14] but there never was one
[33:17] that could raise yourself up again until
[33:20] this day
[33:22] now that it is the greatest
[33:25] week in history the greatest celebration
[33:29] of all times
[33:31] this easter is where he proved
[33:35] what he had said man can say
[33:38] things but yet it isn't
[33:41] exactly can be believed upon
[33:45] thoroughly until it's been proved to be
[33:47] the truth
[33:49] and it's god who said prove all things
[33:52] the whole face to that which is good
[33:55] he would not tell you to do something
[33:58] that he would not do himself
[34:01] so he proved who this
[34:04] was that died for our sins
[34:10] and now not only is it a memorial day
[34:15] of all these great easter flowers
[34:18] and easter bonnets and pink rabbits and
[34:22] so forth that we've got into and holy
[34:26] celebrations
[34:27] which is all right but this is not
[34:30] the real thing
[34:34] that way as people today are trying to
[34:38] say
[34:39] we should wash feet once the year on
[34:42] on uh
[34:45] thursday and on friday we should take
[34:48] the communion and
[34:50] all different doctrines they argue about
[34:53] where they should be this day or that
[34:55] day or what should be a sabbath day or
[34:56] the first day of the week or
[34:58] all these things are just
[35:02] merely tradition what good would
[35:06] any of it do you whether you had lit or
[35:09] not lent
[35:11] if there's no life in you
[35:14] it's only a memorial which is nothing
[35:18] against it but they have
[35:20] certainly carried out their traditions
[35:23] but
[35:23] left off the main thing satan doesn't
[35:27] care how
[35:28] religious you are or how right you are
[35:31] in your doctrine
[35:32] if you miss that life your
[35:35] won't come up anyhow
[35:39] no matter how religious how good how
[35:41] many churches you belong to or will
[35:43] belong to
[35:44] it doesn't matter one thing
[35:48] unless you have been born again
[35:51] therefore if god raised up jesus from
[35:55] the dead did he raise him up for a
[35:58] memorial
[35:59] and is this resurrection morning only uh
[36:03] uh one day in the year or certain day
[36:06] that we celebrate this
[36:08] are are we benefactors of his
[36:12] resurrection
[36:13] amen what does it mean to me
[36:17] what does it mean to you now we believe
[36:20] by
[36:20] faith that he raised from the dead
[36:24] but what has that got to do with me
[36:27] that was 2 000 years ago
[36:31] now to find this text as i
[36:35] was tired my arm hurting me
[36:38] from shops that the nurse gave me for
[36:43] leave overseas now as you know in a few
[36:45] days
[36:48] um but have these shots done and on
[36:52] and with coloring yellow fever and
[36:54] everything i was pretty weary
[36:57] making me sick which seizure requires to
[37:00] have these shots before you go
[37:02] into the other nation and
[37:05] he said give caesar that which is caesar
[37:09] but then give god that which is god
[37:11] [Applause]
[37:13] and as i was sitting there wondering
[37:16] what would i
[37:17] speak to this waiting audience this
[37:19] morning
[37:20] which i'm very thankful for and men and
[37:24] women who would lay their life on the
[37:27] line for
[37:28] what you would say but how should i
[37:31] do it what should i take for a text and
[37:36] then while i was sitting there
[37:38] almost asleep my door
[37:41] rattled uh out on the front side of the
[37:44] house
[37:45] nobody being there but myself as
[37:48] far as i knew i listened i didn't get it
[37:52] just right
[37:53] after a while the den room door where i
[37:57] have turned into my study it rattled
[38:01] and someone kept shaking the door huh
[38:04] i went to the door and opened the door
[38:08] and to my surprise a pretty
[38:11] little yellow-haired blue-eyed
[38:15] girl stood there looked like a little
[38:18] easter flower
[38:19] sitting here looking at me now
[38:22] she handed me a card
[38:27] and it was the uh of course i guess when
[38:30] i get home they'll be easter cards and
[38:32] so forth but the only one
[38:34] being leaving home that i'd received
[38:38] and she said
[38:41] brother branham this is from daddy and
[38:45] me
[38:46] she want to be sure that me was in it
[38:50] and her arthritic father
[38:54] sitting in a wheelchair had sent
[38:58] this card when i
[39:01] took it and thanked the little
[39:04] darling as she turned and walked away
[39:08] from the door
[39:10] i opened up the card and in the
[39:14] form of this card i
[39:17] drew my text for on the card
[39:21] was the saint mark 16
[39:25] 1-2 sun up the sun was rising
[39:30] and then i thought of that and then the
[39:33] subject
[39:34] of the quickening of
[39:37] jesus christ to be raised up from the
[39:40] dead
[39:41] drew my subject
[39:44] now the sun
[39:48] at the rising of the sun
[39:52] well there was a time when the world was
[39:56] laying in
[39:56] utter darkness it was without thorn
[40:01] and it was void and it was all
[40:05] covered with water and was
[40:09] laying there in this dark
[40:12] dismal gloomy atmosphere
[40:17] and the spirit of god moved upon that
[40:20] water and said
[40:22] let there be light
[40:26] god had a reason to do that
[40:29] for down beneath that water
[40:33] there were seeds that he had planted
[40:37] and it had to have that sunlight
[40:40] to make it live
[40:43] and the first light was ever given in
[40:46] the earth
[40:47] was god's spoken word
[40:51] the first light that ever struck the
[40:53] earth was god's spoken word he said
[40:55] let there be light amen
[40:58] and there was light that turned darkness
[41:02] into light in order to bring forth
[41:05] a creation of joy
[41:09] and life upon the earth
[41:12] then the spirit of god as it moved with
[41:15] love and compassion
[41:16] at that great day the first day of the
[41:19] dawn
[41:20] of creation upon the earth
[41:23] the sun rose and swept across his
[41:26] rays and dried up the waters from the
[41:30] earth and made an
[41:31] atmosphere above and for its first time
[41:35] it was to bring
[41:36] joy and life to the earth by a seed
[41:40] that was a great hour
[41:44] but oh it wasn't nothing that sunrise
[41:47] like the sunrise on that easter morning
[41:51] this time with the sun leaping
[41:55] into the skies it brought forth a
[41:58] greater sunrise than ever because
[42:01] it came greater news with this summer
[42:04] surprise
[42:06] than it did with the sunrise at the
[42:08] beginning
[42:10] this sunrise brought a news that
[42:13] he is risen
[42:18] he is quickened from the dead as he's
[42:21] promised he's risen from
[42:24] the dead the first time the sun rose in
[42:29] genesis
[42:31] it was bringing a message that there
[42:32] will be life upon the earth
[42:34] mortal life but this time when the sun
[42:38] rose
[42:39] there was a a dual sun rising
[42:43] another sunrising it was that not only
[42:46] s u n rising it was the s o
[42:50] n had risen
[42:53] to bring eternal life to all god
[42:57] promises that before knowledge he'd seen
[43:01] laying upon the earth no more could the
[43:06] botany life live back there at the
[43:08] beginning without the
[43:10] s-u-n to bring it to life no more
[43:13] than today when sons of god is
[43:17] up on the earth it takes a s-o-n light
[43:20] to bring them to eternal life
[43:23] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[43:26] foundation of the world
[43:28] he had chosen them in himself
[43:31] before the foundation of the world on
[43:33] easter morning
[43:35] then in this dirt somewhere
[43:38] laid our bodies at that time
[43:42] for we are the dust of the earth
[43:45] and in heaven there was a book of memory
[43:49] and his attributes was in him knowing
[43:52] that they're called this
[43:54] son of god race it would also raise the
[43:58] life
[43:58] every son that was poor ordained to this
[44:01] great time
[44:03] he knew it would be and what a more
[44:06] glorious sunrise that was than it was
[44:09] at the beginning at times when it first
[44:12] gone now this great
[44:16] breaking of the easter seal
[44:19] now today we have a tuberculosis
[44:23] easter seal people send
[44:26] a message one to the other and to
[44:29] support this great
[44:33] fun or drive for the doctors and
[44:36] medical science to work upon uh
[44:40] something to retire to help the
[44:43] tuberculosis
[44:44] they are still what we call an easter
[44:47] seal
[44:48] when we send message one to another but
[44:51] when we
[44:51] receive the message that seal is broken
[44:56] because the seal is what's got a message
[44:59] bound on the inside and now
[45:02] the true easter seal on this sunrise
[45:07] was broken and the secret of
[45:10] life after death was revealed amen
[45:13] before that time we didn't know the
[45:18] world
[45:19] uh grouped in darkness
[45:23] groped around man suspicion
[45:27] theory was among man's heart tradition
[45:31] made up man worship idols they
[45:34] worshipped the sun
[45:35] they worshipped all kinds of gods and
[45:38] all kinds of people that made claims
[45:39] they all went into the grave and they
[45:41] stayed in the grave but the real
[45:45] seal had been broken and one who once
[45:49] lived as
[45:50] we live died as we will die
[45:53] was risen from the dead what a
[45:57] morning never one like it in all the
[46:00] history of the world
[46:02] the secret was made known that he was
[46:05] both resurrection and alive
[46:09] and he said when he come forth on that
[46:11] morning because
[46:12] i live you live also
[46:16] not only was he the beneficiary
[46:19] of the resurrection but all those
[46:23] seed that was resting in god's great
[46:26] prowess
[46:26] was a benefactor of that resurrection to
[46:30] life because he said because
[46:31] ali ye shall live
[46:35] also
[46:39] that was the breaking of the seal
[46:41] because he was brought
[46:42] up so will everyone that's
[46:46] in christ be brought up with him
[46:50] at this glorious sunrise god had proven
[46:53] or
[46:53] vindicated his word all the glooms and
[46:57] doubts
[46:58] that have moved in people's minds
[47:01] was taken away because here was he
[47:04] who once lived eat drink and fellowship
[47:08] with mankind
[47:09] that said i have power to lay my life
[47:12] down i have power
[47:13] to raise it up again and now not only
[47:17] had he
[47:18] made the statement but he proved it to
[47:20] be the truth
[47:22] amen what a glorious
[47:25] thing that is i'm sure this morning
[47:28] that even we who believe it cannot
[47:32] comprehend what a great thing that was
[47:36] amen because he raised from the dead
[47:41] we also have already raised from the
[47:45] head
[47:46] for we were in him notice
[47:50] now as the gloom covered the earth and
[47:54] the seeds could not live
[47:55] without the s-u in their eyes and plume
[47:59] had covered the earth
[48:00] and now the s-o-n was risen and all
[48:04] glue was banished by this light as it
[48:06] spread across
[48:07] of the nations to the people that he is
[48:11] not here but he has risen
[48:14] what uh what a statement he had proved
[48:16] his word
[48:18] he had proved it be to be true
[48:21] for he had now conquered
[48:25] death hell and the great the trinity
[48:28] of the devil death hell and the grave
[48:33] satan is the author of death he
[48:37] is the possessor of hell
[48:40] and also the great and that was the
[48:43] trinity
[48:44] of satan being caused by one
[48:48] thing that was death death you go up the
[48:51] grave and being a sinner you go to hell
[48:53] all the very one thing the trinity of
[48:56] satan
[48:57] which was death that had helped man in
[49:00] captivity
[49:01] all these years but now the true
[49:05] trinity of god being one
[49:09] manifested in christ who was life
[49:12] and it broke the seals and conquered the
[49:14] enemy
[49:15] and rose up the one true and living god
[49:20] i am he that was dead
[49:23] and i'm alive forever lord has a jesus
[49:26] death
[49:27] and hell god
[49:30] in one made man and dwelt among us and
[49:33] conquered every enemy
[49:36] and it proved that the trinity of
[49:39] satan was conquered and if the trinity
[49:41] of god was made known because only
[49:44] god alone had power to bring life back
[49:46] again
[49:48] he was that emmanuel
[49:51] for god had been manifested
[49:54] in the flesh no wonder he could claim
[49:57] there
[49:58] matthew 27 chapter all powers in heaven
[50:02] earth is given into my hand
[50:04] i send you to be my witnesses to all the
[50:07] world
[50:08] he had conquered both death hell and the
[50:11] grave
[50:12] not only did he do that and caught out
[50:15] triumph
[50:18] with all the power and heavens and earth
[50:20] all that was the father all that was the
[50:22] holy ghost and all that there ever was
[50:25] was in him all powers in heaven
[50:28] and earth is given unto me everything
[50:32] else is powerless
[50:34] he had conquered it now
[50:38] and then not only that he
[50:41] sent word to his disciples his believing
[50:44] fear enough for i am he
[50:48] that was dead and is alive again
[50:51] forevermore
[50:53] i have the keys to death in hell
[50:58] i've already conquered it don't fear
[51:01] anymore for every for our daily
[51:05] predestinated
[51:06] seed of god shall come to life when that
[51:08] light spreads across the earth
[51:10] by the glorious gospel in every age it
[51:12] will bring forth the crop
[51:14] that god ordains it to do it he is
[51:17] raised
[51:18] from the dead oh what a
[51:22] wonderful thing that is i
[51:26] am alive or quickened the word
[51:29] means the word quicken the greek word
[51:31] means that something that's made alive
[51:34] after death
[51:35] like the the seed that goes into the
[51:37] earth it has to die
[51:39] every bit of the seed
[51:42] it has to rot every bit of the seed
[51:46] and every bit of the life that was in
[51:49] the seat
[51:49] has to come forth again
[51:54] he was quickened not only that
[51:58] and will stand the same life that
[52:01] quickened me
[52:02] the power that brought me from the grave
[52:06] i will stand it upon you to quicken you
[52:10] that where i am there ye will be also
[52:16] in luke 24 chapter 49 first
[52:19] he said behold i send the promise of the
[52:21] father upon you
[52:24] but terry are waking in the
[52:27] city of jerusalem until you be endued
[52:31] with power from ohio
[52:34] to show that not only did he draw all
[52:36] the benefits out of it
[52:38] but he shared those benefits
[52:42] he come to redeem or to bring to life
[52:46] those predestinated seed that god seen
[52:49] before the
[52:50] foundation of the world and put their
[52:52] names in the book of life
[52:54] and here they are on the earth without a
[52:56] hope he
[52:58] came not only to be the blessing but to
[53:01] share the blessing with every
[53:03] predestinated seed
[53:06] now if the seed wasn't on the earth it
[53:08] could not live
[53:10] it had to be on the earth and also
[53:12] germanized
[53:14] no matter how long it's kept in darkness
[53:16] it'll come forth
[53:17] when the s-o-n shines upon it
[53:20] notice now he come to share it with us
[53:24] no wonder the gospel is good news
[53:28] the very word gospel means the good news
[53:32] the good news what if a man died
[53:36] or faith that's good news
[53:39] if christ is born that's good news
[53:42] but never a news never was there
[53:46] news like this news
[53:49] that he who made the promise has
[53:52] confirmed the promise
[53:54] and he's alive forevermore and had the
[53:58] keys to both death
[53:59] and hell any time all the
[54:03] gloom was shut away there was no more
[54:06] gloom to be seen
[54:07] or the sun was up from the grave
[54:11] there was no oh he will come or he
[54:14] may come he had already come
[54:17] the gospel good news notice the very
[54:20] message of the gospel itself
[54:23] is to prove to the people
[54:27] that he is risen
[54:30] go tell my disciples
[54:34] that i am risen from the dead and i'll
[54:37] meet with them
[54:39] to confirm this to them
[54:42] oh god how in this last
[54:46] days there shall be light again across
[54:50] here to my disciples
[54:53] go tell them that i am not dead and i'm
[54:56] not a tradition
[54:57] but i am a living christ
[55:01] amen i'll meet them
[55:04] take this message to my a disciple
[55:09] that i'm risen from the dead the gospel
[55:12] good news you say is that right
[55:13] hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[55:15] yesterday today and forever
[55:19] we as beneficiaries are to prove his
[55:22] life
[55:23] is in us now the beneficiaries
[55:27] of this fight the life he never was a
[55:31] life lived like it
[55:32] he was the son of god and he died
[55:37] and that shut it out but when he raised
[55:40] again
[55:40] from the dead on easter morning
[55:44] then we as his servants
[55:47] are commissioned by him to go into
[55:50] all the world and to bring
[55:53] this good news to every person
[55:58] that he is a living and how can we
[56:02] do it by word only
[56:05] or it is written the gospel can not by
[56:08] word only
[56:09] but through the power and the
[56:10] manifestation of the holy spirit
[56:13] to prove that he is alive
[56:18] now if there is another gospel that paul
[56:21] spoke to
[56:22] one of the groups i am so surprised that
[56:25] you turn
[56:26] to another gospel which there is a
[56:27] letter but a make-believe gospel
[56:32] to a denominational fiction
[56:36] turning from that good news
[56:41] and because i live
[56:44] ye live also and i live in you
[56:50] and the works that i do john 14 12
[56:53] the works that i do will identify
[56:57] myself in you what a message
[57:02] no wonder we've had a dark world of
[57:04] theology
[57:07] but in the evening time there shall come
[57:09] light again
[57:11] there will be a resurrection amendment
[57:14] in the
[57:14] evening time it shall
[57:17] be like that's the evening time
[57:20] now the very essence of the message
[57:26] that was sent that he is risen
[57:30] from the dead we his beneficiaries
[57:34] we who share the resurrection with him
[57:37] draw benefits from this by proving to
[57:41] the world
[57:42] that he is a liar we cannot do it by
[57:44] word only
[57:45] we cannot do it for some traditional man
[57:48] we only reflect
[57:49] exactly what we're pointing to i'm
[57:52] afraid today that too many of us are not
[57:55] getting people to christ we're getting
[57:58] them to a church to a theory
[58:01] but we must get them to christ he is the
[58:04] only one and the only one that has life
[58:08] he that has the son has life and if the
[58:12] life
[58:12] of a man's head be projected in you
[58:17] you will live the same life he lives
[58:20] if the blood of a man was a certain type
[58:25] and you took the blood from one man and
[58:27] changed the blood of
[58:28] one man into another he'd absolutely be
[58:31] that typed blood
[58:33] and if your spirit that's in you
[58:36] is reconciled and you are anointed
[58:40] with the life that was in christ is upon
[58:42] you
[58:43] romans 8 11 says if the spirit
[58:47] that raised christ from the dead dwells
[58:50] in you
[58:51] it'll also quicken your mortal body
[58:56] that same life then paying powers
[59:00] then say beneficiaries that he had your
[59:04] own earth from god
[59:05] he redeemed you a seed
[59:09] that was for known by god whose names
[59:12] was put on the land book of life before
[59:14] the foundation of the world
[59:15] and that gospel why do the resurrection
[59:18] the confirmation of the word
[59:20] how do we know he was a christ because
[59:23] he
[59:24] proves what he talks about god i know
[59:27] the message of the hour
[59:29] god proves what he's promised that he
[59:31] talks about
[59:34] that is the identification that we are
[59:37] of beneficiaries with him in the
[59:39] resurrection
[59:41] he proves what he's talked about what he
[59:44] promised to do in christ
[59:46] he proved it on the resurrection what he
[59:48] promised to do in the days of moses he
[59:50] proved him
[59:51] what he promised in the days of enoch he
[59:53] proved it
[59:55] in all the days of the apostles he
[59:57] proved it
[59:59] now i understand he proves what he said
[1:00:02] because they are a part of that seed
[1:00:05] that was represented on the book of life
[1:00:08] that he came to redeem
[1:00:09] back to god again
[1:00:13] oh what a message by easter morning not
[1:00:17] only
[1:00:18] did he raise but his beneficiaries
[1:00:21] raised with him
[1:00:25] they were in crying at his crucifixion
[1:00:28] they were ending at his resurrection
[1:00:30] we are with beneficiaries quicken after
[1:00:33] being dead in darkness
[1:00:35] in a darkened world of unbelief or
[1:00:38] churches and denominations and so forth
[1:00:40] had brought us out and
[1:00:42] there's something in us calling old we
[1:00:44] want god we're hungry and thirsty for
[1:00:46] god
[1:00:46] we join the methodist baptist
[1:00:48] pentecostal presbyterians
[1:00:50] what more still there was something
[1:00:52] wrong
[1:00:53] we just couldn't find it yet and all of
[1:00:56] a sudden while we was groping in
[1:00:58] darkness
[1:00:59] the great resurrection came to us
[1:01:03] in the manifestation of the promised
[1:01:05] word of god
[1:01:06] like he was the manifestation of the
[1:01:08] promised word of god
[1:01:11] i will not leave his soul in hell
[1:01:14] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:01:16] christ
[1:01:17] he manifested in every word of god that
[1:01:20] was promised to him
[1:01:21] he proved it when he raised on the
[1:01:23] easter morning
[1:01:26] ah them who were once groping in
[1:01:29] darkness and wandering around if they
[1:01:31] should wash
[1:01:32] feet on this day or if they should keep
[1:01:34] a certain day or do a certain set of
[1:01:36] rules all those things passed away
[1:01:39] well that was a glorious resurrection
[1:01:42] that defied every
[1:01:43] man-made thing that man had ever done
[1:01:46] every man-made reason
[1:01:48] there had never been to that time a man
[1:01:50] that could lay his life down and pick it
[1:01:52] up again
[1:01:53] he defied that scientific proof they had
[1:01:56] by raising again when they say
[1:01:59] that jesus christ is deceit yesterday
[1:02:02] and forever that his power isn't the
[1:02:03] same
[1:02:04] that is gospel is the same when the
[1:02:06] bible says it's the same
[1:02:08] god's desire for denomination ever creed
[1:02:11] and he moved forth with his holy spirit
[1:02:13] as he promised
[1:02:14] hence proved it to us as he
[1:02:17] is alive we are the benefactors
[1:02:22] of his resurrection quicken
[1:02:25] after being fed in the world and sin and
[1:02:28] trespasses
[1:02:29] he is quickened us together with him
[1:02:32] raised with you now sitting in heavenly
[1:02:34] places in christ jesus
[1:02:38] amen that does me a whole lot of good
[1:02:43] amen i enjoy the message and i enjoy the
[1:02:48] voice of the seventh angel
[1:02:51] god is so good friends i just want to
[1:02:54] take a minute and we'll bring out some
[1:02:55] points here and we'll answer these
[1:02:57] questions
[1:02:58] amen and today we we're not as long
[1:03:02] we'll be a little bit longer in the
[1:03:04] message the
[1:03:05] the next two times we do this but i want
[1:03:06] a little time to talk beforehand and set
[1:03:09] it up
[1:03:09] so the first question we had is what is
[1:03:12] brother branham's subject
[1:03:14] and if you turn to paragraph 23
[1:03:18] which is uh on page four
[1:03:21] page four paragraph 23
[1:03:25] he says now my text this morning i want
[1:03:27] to take for a text that is the rising of
[1:03:29] the sun
[1:03:30] and for a subject i want to use the
[1:03:32] quickening power
[1:03:33] so his text was the rising of the sun
[1:03:35] but he wanted to talk about the
[1:03:36] quickening power
[1:03:37] that was what has been given to us amen
[1:03:40] quickening power
[1:03:42] let's look here at the second question
[1:03:44] why does satan not care how religious
[1:03:46] you are or how right you are
[1:03:48] in your doctrine let's look at the next
[1:03:50] page page five and we'll begin it
[1:03:52] at paragraph 29 as people today are
[1:03:55] trying to say we should wash feet once a
[1:03:57] year on thursday and on friday
[1:03:59] we should take the communion and all
[1:04:01] different doctrines they argue about
[1:04:03] whether it should be this day or that
[1:04:04] day or whether it should be sabbath day
[1:04:06] or the first day of the week
[1:04:07] all these things are just merely
[1:04:09] tradition what good would any of it
[1:04:12] do you whether you had lent or not lent
[1:04:14] if there is no life
[1:04:15] in you it's only a memorial which there
[1:04:18] is nothing against it but they've had
[1:04:20] certainly
[1:04:21] carried out their traditions but left
[1:04:23] off the main thing
[1:04:24] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:04:26] or how right you are in your doctrine
[1:04:28] if you miss that life you won't come up
[1:04:31] anyhow
[1:04:33] that's the key amen when he resurrected
[1:04:35] it was the life of jesus christ that
[1:04:37] come back
[1:04:38] amen on the day of pentecost he sent
[1:04:40] that quickening power that life
[1:04:42] the power of the holy ghost back upon
[1:04:43] the people to quicken them to life
[1:04:45] amen and if you miss that none of it
[1:04:48] else is worth anything anyways
[1:04:50] whether you do lent or don't do lent
[1:04:51] whether you wash feet or take communion
[1:04:53] or keep all the ordinances of the church
[1:04:55] amen none of it matters if you don't get
[1:04:57] the quickening power to quicken you to
[1:04:59] life
[1:05:00] we've kept the religious orders we've
[1:05:02] kept the feast days and we've kept the
[1:05:03] holy days and we've kept church at tens
[1:05:05] and we've kept tithing
[1:05:06] amen but but if there's no quickening
[1:05:08] power to you to bring you to a new birth
[1:05:11] experience
[1:05:11] then it was all done in vain
[1:05:14] because the quickening power has come
[1:05:16] back amen the life of jesus christ upon
[1:05:19] his children
[1:05:20] let's read that again uh paragraph 30 i
[1:05:22] read that sentence again and move on
[1:05:25] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:05:26] or how right you are in your doctrine
[1:05:28] if you miss that life you won't come up
[1:05:30] anyhow
[1:05:31] no matter how religious how good how
[1:05:33] many churches you belong to
[1:05:35] or will belong to it doesn't matter one
[1:05:37] thing unless you have been born again
[1:05:40] amen that when you're born again you've
[1:05:43] received the quickening power
[1:05:45] that quickens you to life man let's go
[1:05:48] to question number three how did brother
[1:05:50] banham get his text and his subject for
[1:05:52] this message
[1:05:53] i really like this one man if we go up
[1:05:55] to paragraph 32
[1:05:57] at the bottom of this page he starts off
[1:06:00] here
[1:06:01] just above paragraph 32 that little
[1:06:02] sentence says now to find this text now
[1:06:05] he's telling you how he found this text
[1:06:07] as i was tired my arm hurting me from
[1:06:09] shots that the nurse gave me
[1:06:10] for to leave overseas now as you know in
[1:06:12] a few days and i must have these shots
[1:06:14] son and i and with cholera yellow fever
[1:06:17] and everything i was
[1:06:18] pretty weary making me sick which caesar
[1:06:20] requires to have these shots before you
[1:06:22] go into the other nation
[1:06:23] and he said give caesar that which is
[1:06:25] caesar's but then give god that which is
[1:06:27] god's
[1:06:27] and i was sitting there wondering what
[1:06:29] would i speak to this waiting audience
[1:06:31] this morning
[1:06:32] i absolutely love this this
[1:06:36] to me when brother bannon preaches it is
[1:06:38] the rising of the sun
[1:06:39] this is a one of the most profound
[1:06:41] messages that he preaches
[1:06:43] full of meat with impact on our life now
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:46] he's sitting here the morning he's
[1:06:47] preaching it wondering what will i
[1:06:49] preach
[1:06:51] what will i preach amen and sometimes we
[1:06:55] think
[1:06:55] in ourselves that brother brenham had
[1:06:57] everything mapped out and he had it all
[1:06:59] figured out and he knew
[1:07:00] no he was just a man like you and i are
[1:07:02] a man but he had a gift in him and god
[1:07:04] was leading him step
[1:07:05] by step by step the same way he's
[1:07:08] leading you and i
[1:07:09] we don't have the next day figured out
[1:07:11] we don't have the next sermon figured
[1:07:13] out
[1:07:13] all we're doing is trusting in god to
[1:07:15] lead us step by step
[1:07:16] day by day just the way he led the
[1:07:18] prophet
[1:07:20] and here he is the morning he's
[1:07:21] preaching i'm telling you if this was
[1:07:23] me i would be in tears
[1:07:26] but brother branham had got to the place
[1:07:28] where he knew god would give him
[1:07:29] direction and god was leading
[1:07:32] i was as i was sitting there wondering
[1:07:34] what would i speak to this waiting
[1:07:36] audience this morning
[1:07:37] which i'm very thankful for and men and
[1:07:38] women who would lay their life on the
[1:07:40] line for what you would say
[1:07:42] how should i do it what should i take
[1:07:43] for a text
[1:07:45] and then when i was sitting there almost
[1:07:47] asleep my door rattled out on the front
[1:07:49] side of the house nobody being there but
[1:07:51] myself as far as i knew
[1:07:53] i listened i didn't get it just right
[1:07:55] after a while the din room door
[1:07:56] where i turned into my study it rattled
[1:07:58] and someone kept shaking the door and i
[1:08:00] went
[1:08:01] to the door and opened the door and to
[1:08:02] my surprise a pretty little
[1:08:04] yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there
[1:08:06] looked like a little easter flower
[1:08:09] that's sitting here
[1:08:10] looking at me now she handed me a card
[1:08:14] and it was of course i guess when i get
[1:08:15] home they'll be easter cards and so
[1:08:17] forth but the only one being leaving
[1:08:18] home that i had received
[1:08:20] and she said brother brother branham
[1:08:22] this is from daddy and me
[1:08:24] she wanted to be sure that me was in it
[1:08:26] and her
[1:08:27] arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair
[1:08:30] had sent this card
[1:08:31] when i looked it when i took it and
[1:08:33] thanked the little darling and she
[1:08:35] turned and walked away from the door i
[1:08:36] opened up the card
[1:08:38] and in the form of this card i drew my
[1:08:40] text for on the card was
[1:08:42] the saint mark 16 1-2 sun up the sun was
[1:08:45] rising
[1:08:46] then i thought of that and then the
[1:08:47] subject of the quickening of jesus
[1:08:49] christ to be raised up from the dead
[1:08:51] i drew my subject see
[1:08:56] we don't know what impact we have
[1:09:00] just living life brother ben said
[1:09:03] that this little girl who delivered this
[1:09:05] car she did it on behalf of her and her
[1:09:07] daddy
[1:09:08] and her daddy was an arthritic father he
[1:09:10] was
[1:09:11] he was he was suffering with arthritis
[1:09:13] and in a wheelchair
[1:09:15] but he got in his heart that he would
[1:09:17] send this card to brother branham
[1:09:19] and the whole thing was orchestrated by
[1:09:22] god
[1:09:24] you know you know who knows if this man
[1:09:28] ever really understand the part he
[1:09:29] played or maybe the little girl didn't
[1:09:31] fully understand the part she played
[1:09:33] but they played a significant part in
[1:09:35] the message of the hour
[1:09:37] don't ever underrate yourself and don't
[1:09:39] ever when god leads you to do something
[1:09:41] if it's as simple as sending somebody a
[1:09:43] card or
[1:09:44] a text message or a phone call don't
[1:09:45] underrate that if you feel inspired to
[1:09:47] do it
[1:09:48] do it you have no idea what god will
[1:09:50] take
[1:09:51] he took a little boy's lunch one time
[1:09:53] and fed five thousand what will he do if
[1:09:54] he inspires you
[1:09:55] with a little note of encouragement
[1:09:57] little word a little something that he
[1:09:59] calls you to do
[1:10:00] you have no idea how far that will reach
[1:10:02] and what impact that will have
[1:10:04] so i absolutely found that amazing where
[1:10:07] brother branham got the text and the
[1:10:09] subject
[1:10:10] for this message was from that arthritic
[1:10:13] father who wanted to send a card to the
[1:10:14] prophet
[1:10:15] and send his little blue-eyed
[1:10:17] blond-haired darling over there to
[1:10:18] deliver it
[1:10:20] praise be to god god
[1:10:23] god works through his body
[1:10:26] question number four what was the s-o-n
[1:10:29] rise
[1:10:29] 4 what was the sunrise 4 let's go to
[1:10:32] paragraph
[1:10:33] 40 here at the bottom of page 6.
[1:10:40] the first time the sun rose in genesis
[1:10:42] it was bringing a message that there
[1:10:43] will be life upon the earth
[1:10:45] mortal life but this time when the sun
[1:10:48] rose there was a dual sun rising another
[1:10:50] sun rising
[1:10:51] it was not only the s-u-n rising it was
[1:10:53] the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal
[1:10:55] life
[1:10:56] to all god's promised seed that by
[1:10:58] foreknowledge
[1:10:59] he had seen laying upon the earth mother
[1:11:02] of them takes us and types it all the
[1:11:03] way back to genesis 1
[1:11:05] amen when genesis in genesis 1 2 we find
[1:11:08] the earth
[1:11:09] and cursed state amen darkness shrouded
[1:11:11] it and water covered the face of the
[1:11:13] deep
[1:11:13] but god had put seeds down in there and
[1:11:16] they were dermatized seed that had to
[1:11:17] come to life
[1:11:18] and when god first spoke and created an
[1:11:21] atmosphere and a condition
[1:11:22] amen and brought light upon the earth he
[1:11:24] was doing it to bring the seed up
[1:11:27] and this time at the rising of the sun
[1:11:29] when the s-o-n came up out of the grave
[1:11:31] amen it was to do the same thing it was
[1:11:33] to bring the light of life upon the seed
[1:11:36] that was laying there to bring you and i
[1:11:38] to life
[1:11:41] for the seed that by foreknowledge he
[1:11:43] had seen laying upon the earth
[1:11:45] no more could the bodily life live back
[1:11:47] there at the beginning without the s-u-n
[1:11:49] to bring it to life
[1:11:50] no more than today when sons of god is
[1:11:52] upon the earth
[1:11:53] it takes the s o n light to bring them
[1:11:55] to eternal life
[1:11:57] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[1:11:59] foundation of the world he had chosen
[1:12:01] them in himself
[1:12:02] before the foundation of the world and
[1:12:04] on easter morning then in this
[1:12:06] in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies
[1:12:08] at that time
[1:12:10] your body was predestinated and four
[1:12:12] ordained and already laying or the
[1:12:13] material for your body was already here
[1:12:16] at that time at the resurrection and in
[1:12:19] heaven there was a book of
[1:12:20] memory and his attributes was in him
[1:12:22] knowing that because this son of god
[1:12:24] raised it would also raise the life
[1:12:27] every sun that was foreordained to this
[1:12:29] great time
[1:12:30] he knew it would be and what a what a
[1:12:32] more glorious sunrise that was than it
[1:12:35] was at the beginning
[1:12:36] at time when it first dawned let's go
[1:12:39] over to paragraph 54 on
[1:12:41] page 9 and continue reading
[1:12:45] paragraph 54 on page 9. now and then not
[1:12:49] only that
[1:12:50] he sent word to his disciples his
[1:12:52] believing fear not for i am he that was
[1:12:55] dead
[1:12:55] and is alive again forevermore and i
[1:12:57] have the keys to death and hell
[1:12:59] i've already conquered it don't fear
[1:13:02] anymore for
[1:13:03] every foreordained predestinated seed of
[1:13:06] god
[1:13:06] shall come to life when that light
[1:13:08] spreads across the earth of the glorious
[1:13:10] gospel
[1:13:11] in every age it'll bring forth the crop
[1:13:14] that god ordained it to
[1:13:15] he had raised from the dead it was a
[1:13:19] guarantee he said fear not
[1:13:21] don't have any more fear if you're a
[1:13:23] predestinated seed of god foreordained
[1:13:26] chosen in christ
[1:13:27] before the foundation of the world and
[1:13:29] have your name written in the lamb's
[1:13:30] book of life
[1:13:31] as that s-o-n is traveling through the
[1:13:33] last seven church ages
[1:13:35] in every season and every age it'll
[1:13:37] bring that
[1:13:38] seed to life that's what he's done for
[1:13:42] you that's what he's done for me
[1:13:43] that's what he'll do for every
[1:13:44] predestinated seed because it
[1:13:47] is the rising of the sun it is the
[1:13:49] resurrected of jesus christ and his
[1:13:51] light
[1:13:51] is shining upon the earth to bring those
[1:13:54] seeds to life today
[1:13:56] praise god oh what a wonderful thing
[1:13:59] that is i'm alive or quickened
[1:14:02] the word means quicken the greek word
[1:14:04] means that something that's made alive
[1:14:06] after death
[1:14:07] like the seed that goes into the earth
[1:14:08] it has to die every bit of the seed
[1:14:10] it has to rot every bit of the seed in
[1:14:12] every bit of the life that was
[1:14:14] in the seed has to come forth again he
[1:14:17] was quick and not only that
[1:14:18] and will send that same life that
[1:14:20] quickened me the power that brought me
[1:14:22] from the grave
[1:14:23] i will send it upon you to quicken you
[1:14:26] that where i
[1:14:26] am there you will be also so the same
[1:14:30] power listen what was your born-again
[1:14:33] experience
[1:14:35] the very same power that brought him
[1:14:38] out of the grave was the very same power
[1:14:40] that came upon you
[1:14:41] to bring you out of the grave of the
[1:14:44] deadness of laodicea and bring you into
[1:14:46] life
[1:14:47] not a different force not a different
[1:14:49] power but the same power
[1:14:51] the resurrection power of jesus christ
[1:14:53] by the resurrection light from the
[1:14:55] s-o-n amen the same power that raised
[1:14:58] him up was the same power that quickened
[1:15:00] you to life
[1:15:02] that's power friends and is the same
[1:15:04] power that will still quicken the seed
[1:15:06] tonight
[1:15:08] paragraph 58 in luke 24 chapter 49 verse
[1:15:11] he said behold i send the promise of the
[1:15:13] father upon you
[1:15:14] but tarry year await you in the city of
[1:15:16] jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:15:19] from on high to show that only he did he
[1:15:22] draw all the benefits out of it
[1:15:23] but he shared those benefits he came to
[1:15:26] redeem or to bring to life those
[1:15:28] predestinated seed that god seen before
[1:15:30] the foundation of the world
[1:15:32] and put their names in the book of life
[1:15:34] and here they are on earth without a
[1:15:36] hope
[1:15:37] he came not only to be the blessing not
[1:15:40] only to be the blessing but to share the
[1:15:42] blessing with every
[1:15:43] predestinated seed now if the seed
[1:15:45] wasn't on the earth it could not live it
[1:15:47] had to be on the earth
[1:15:49] and also germatized no matter how long
[1:15:52] it's kept in darkness
[1:15:53] it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines
[1:15:55] upon it notice now
[1:15:57] he came to share it with us
[1:16:00] he came to share the resurrection with
[1:16:02] you and i
[1:16:03] that's why brother branham started off
[1:16:05] he said is this resurrection just a
[1:16:06] memorial
[1:16:07] was he raised up for a memorial what was
[1:16:10] it for does it have anything to do with
[1:16:11] me
[1:16:12] amen what does it have to do with me it
[1:16:13] happened two thousand years ago
[1:16:15] and brother ben i'm starting to tell us
[1:16:16] it has everything to do with you
[1:16:19] because he said because i live you live
[1:16:21] amen if it wasn't for him raising you
[1:16:23] couldn't raise but because i live you
[1:16:25] live
[1:16:26] also amen
[1:16:31] praise god chapter our question five
[1:16:36] what are we quickened from
[1:16:39] let's turn the page here to page 11.
[1:16:45] what are we quickened from
[1:16:50] paragraph 73 on page 11. on easter
[1:16:54] morning not only did he raise but his
[1:16:55] beneficiaries raised with him
[1:16:59] you mean i raised back then absolutely
[1:17:03] you've already raised that's why you
[1:17:04] were guaranteed to raise in this
[1:17:06] generation because you already raised
[1:17:10] they were in christ at his crucifixion
[1:17:12] they were in him at his resurrection
[1:17:14] we are his beneficiaries beneficiaries
[1:17:17] quickened after being dead in darkness
[1:17:20] the darkened world of unbelief where
[1:17:22] churches and denominations and so forth
[1:17:24] had drawn us out
[1:17:25] and there's something in us calling oh
[1:17:26] we want god we're hungry and thirsting
[1:17:28] for god we joined the methodist baptists
[1:17:31] pentecostals presbyterians and what more
[1:17:33] and still there was something wrong
[1:17:35] we just couldn't find it yet and all of
[1:17:36] a sudden while we were groping in
[1:17:38] darkness
[1:17:38] a great resurrection came to us in the
[1:17:41] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:17:43] god
[1:17:45] and it brought us out of dark
[1:17:46] denominationalism
[1:17:49] let's go over to paragraph 79 on page 12
[1:17:51] next page paragraph 79
[1:17:54] we are the benefactors of his
[1:17:56] resurrection quickened
[1:17:58] after being dead in the world in sin
[1:18:01] and trespasses he has quickened us
[1:18:04] together with him
[1:18:05] raised with him now sitting in heavenly
[1:18:07] places in
[1:18:09] christ jesus we were dead in the world
[1:18:12] just like those seeds in genesis 1 2
[1:18:15] covered in
[1:18:17] darkness underneath the deep the face of
[1:18:20] the deep
[1:18:20] darkness covered the face of the deep
[1:18:22] but god parted the waters and let the
[1:18:24] light of the life of jesus
[1:18:26] christ hit us by the revealed word of
[1:18:28] the hour and
[1:18:29] bring that seed to life amen we were
[1:18:32] pulled out of the darkness of the world
[1:18:34] praise god those were the questions that
[1:18:36] i had but there's a couple points i'd
[1:18:37] like to bring out if we can go all the
[1:18:38] way back to page one
[1:18:43] there's a statement brother brennan
[1:18:44] makes here that i find it fascinating
[1:18:47] and it comes right out of the scriptures
[1:18:48] but
[1:18:50] i want to just watch it here in a couple
[1:18:52] places
[1:18:54] and let's look at paragraph two
[1:18:57] and let there come an easter among us
[1:18:58] all today may we as his servants
[1:19:00] understand his word
[1:19:02] that we were in his fellowship then
[1:19:06] did you catch that you were in his
[1:19:09] fellowship
[1:19:09] then and that now that we are risen with
[1:19:12] him and sitting together in heavenly
[1:19:14] places
[1:19:15] let's flip the page on page two and go
[1:19:16] to paragraph 12.
[1:19:23] so there he spoke to me and said the
[1:19:25] seven seals will be open
[1:19:27] the seven mystery sevenfold mystery of
[1:19:29] the bible has been closed up since the
[1:19:30] foundation the world will be revealed
[1:19:32] and we yet a humble little group
[1:19:34] compared with all the world we've
[1:19:36] enjoyed these blessings hearing these
[1:19:37] mysteries marriage divorce servancy and
[1:19:39] all these different questions
[1:19:40] has been completely revealed to us not
[1:19:42] by man but by god himself himself
[1:19:45] that's opened these seven mysteries of
[1:19:47] what the church was
[1:19:49] and how it was in christ at the
[1:19:51] beginning
[1:19:53] it's the same thing it was in christ at
[1:19:55] the beginning and how will be revealed
[1:19:56] in the last days
[1:19:58] let's go to paragraph 73
[1:20:03] all the way over on page eleven
[1:20:10] seventy-three paragraph 73 on page 11 on
[1:20:13] easter morning not only did he raise but
[1:20:15] his beneficiaries raised with him
[1:20:17] they were in christ at his crucifixion
[1:20:20] they were in him at his resurrection we
[1:20:23] are his beneficiaries quickened after
[1:20:25] being dead
[1:20:26] in darkness now let's go to paragraph
[1:20:30] 49 back on page 8.
[1:20:40] paragraph 49 on page 8 i'm sure this
[1:20:42] morning that even we who believe it
[1:20:44] cannot comprehend what a great thing
[1:20:46] that was
[1:20:46] because he raised from the dead we also
[1:20:49] have already raised from the dead
[1:20:51] for we were in him how many of you
[1:20:54] believe that you were in
[1:20:56] him amen the price has been paid when
[1:20:58] was the price paid for me when i was
[1:21:00] in him and paid the price for my sins
[1:21:02] and i resurrected with him and now
[1:21:05] everything that happened there is being
[1:21:07] manifest in this tabernacle of flesh
[1:21:09] today
[1:21:10] but why is it being manifested because
[1:21:12] it happened in him
[1:21:14] amen back then
[1:21:17] let's go to paragraph 70.
[1:21:20] i just want to highlight a point here on
[1:21:23] page 11
[1:21:25] paragraph 70.
[1:21:33] page are your paragraph 70 page 11.
[1:21:36] in that gospel light of the resurrection
[1:21:38] the confirmation of the word
[1:21:40] how did we know he was the christ
[1:21:42] because he proved what he was talking
[1:21:44] about
[1:21:45] how will i know the message of the hour
[1:21:47] god proves what he promised and he's
[1:21:48] talking about
[1:21:49] did god prove it he proved it
[1:21:52] that is the identification that we are
[1:21:54] beneficiaries with him in the
[1:21:55] resurrection
[1:21:56] he proves what he has talked about what
[1:21:59] he promised to do in christ he proved it
[1:22:01] on the resurrection
[1:22:02] what he promised to do in the days of
[1:22:04] moses he proved it what he promised in
[1:22:06] the days of enoch he proved it
[1:22:08] and all the days of the apostles he
[1:22:10] proved it now in this day
[1:22:12] he proves what he said because they are
[1:22:14] part of the seed
[1:22:15] that was predestinated in the book of
[1:22:17] life that he come to redeem
[1:22:18] back to god again oh what a message
[1:22:22] but brother brahm's saying in every day
[1:22:25] god proved the word
[1:22:27] he proved it in moses he proved it in
[1:22:29] enoch he proved it in christ
[1:22:31] he proved it by bringing it to pass and
[1:22:33] today we know that the manifestation of
[1:22:35] the word
[1:22:36] amen is the it is the coming of jesus
[1:22:38] christ and the formation of the bride
[1:22:40] and that bride will have his very same
[1:22:42] life but he
[1:22:43] will prove it amen moses didn't have
[1:22:45] anything to prove
[1:22:48] enoch didn't have anything to prove none
[1:22:50] of them have anything to prove all they
[1:22:52] were doing was being obedient to what
[1:22:54] god told them to do and
[1:22:55] god proved that what they said was true
[1:22:57] god vindicated his word god backed it up
[1:23:00] he didn't ask moses to do it he did it
[1:23:02] himself he just asked moses to believe
[1:23:04] him and say what he says and in this day
[1:23:07] the bride has nothing to prove amen
[1:23:09] all she needs to do is what moses did
[1:23:11] and what enoch did and what elijah did
[1:23:13] amen she just must be obedient to him
[1:23:16] and say what he said
[1:23:17] say it the way he said say it do what he
[1:23:19] says do and he will prove his word once
[1:23:22] again like he always has
[1:23:24] he'll prove it in your life he'll prove
[1:23:25] it in my life amen he'll prove his word
[1:23:28] we just have to stay with his word
[1:23:30] because it's god who proves it
[1:23:33] moses had no power to prove it
[1:23:38] he not had no power to prove it god was
[1:23:40] the one who proved it
[1:23:42] when they stayed with the word
[1:23:47] let's go back to paragraph 61 on page
[1:23:49] 10.
[1:23:53] i want to finish with this
[1:23:56] notice the very message of the gospel
[1:23:58] itself is to prove to the people
[1:24:00] that he has risen go tell my disciples
[1:24:03] that i am risen from the dead and i'll
[1:24:05] meet them
[1:24:06] with them to confirm this to them oh god
[1:24:09] how in this last day there shall be
[1:24:11] light again
[1:24:12] across the earth and i'll prove to my
[1:24:15] disciples go
[1:24:16] tell them that i'm not dead i'm not a
[1:24:18] tradition
[1:24:19] but i'm a living christ i'll meet them
[1:24:22] take this message to my disciples that i
[1:24:24] am risen from the dead
[1:24:25] the gospel good news i'd like to say
[1:24:29] today there's still a light shining in
[1:24:31] the land
[1:24:32] and that light is to prove that he's not
[1:24:34] dead he's not a
[1:24:35] dead christ he's a living christ he's
[1:24:38] not a dead tradition in a dead
[1:24:40] church with a dead denomination but he's

[1:25:41] the hour
[1:25:43] every time i listen to it it just
[1:25:44] refreshes me amen
[1:25:46] it just stirs something deep inside of
[1:25:48] me i mean
[1:25:50] something there's something in me amen
[1:25:52] the seed of god that's in me
[1:25:54] that was that was preordained to respond
[1:25:57] to that message amen
[1:25:59] something in me is down in a receiver a
[1:26:02] crystal that has dialed in to pick up
[1:26:04] that wavelength
[1:26:05] and somebody may listen to it and say
[1:26:07] well that's really loud and he's yelling
[1:26:09] and
[1:26:09] what's he talking about he's condemning
[1:26:11] churches but there's something dialed in
[1:26:13] you and me that says

[1:26:16] and that's the truth also
[1:26:18] amen that's nothing but the truth
[1:26:22] thank god for it i didn't put it there

[1:26:26] change myself and remember before the
[1:26:28] foundation of the world amen that
[1:26:30] frequency was already dialed into that
[1:26:32] seed and god knew what day and what age
[1:26:34] it would come forth
[1:26:35] and what vessel would be tabernacled in
[1:26:37] and god already knew and ordained it for
[1:26:39] this day
[1:26:39] and all i'm doing is responding to god's
[1:26:42] plan and god's purpose
[1:26:44] i didn't have the power to make anything
[1:26:45] happen i didn't have the power to
[1:26:47] quicken myself
[1:26:47] i didn't have the power to bring about a
[1:26:49] new birth i couldn't do it by my actions
[1:26:51] i couldn't do it by my conduct i
[1:26:53] couldn't do it by my begging
[1:26:56] but god had the power the quickening
[1:26:58] power that he had sent in this day
[1:27:01] and that quickening power quicken the
[1:27:04] seed to life
[1:27:05] and all i can do is respond to him
[1:27:09] and say praise you lord jesus be it unto
[1:27:12] me according to your worry
