[0:00] God heals cancer.
[0:02] We
[0:04] We have a family that has a friend who
[0:07] who had cancer and they had her at the
[0:10] house and and this this woman that had
[0:12] the cancer was a registered nurse and
[0:15] and she had taken care of charity when
[0:17] she was in the hospital and another
[0:19] sister at the church when she was in the
[0:20] hospital. And so she'd done a lot of
[0:22] good things for the bride. And so her
[0:26] husband was there with her at our
[0:28] friend's house and and so they asked
[0:31] could we come and pray for him. So at
[0:32] communion that Sunday, we took a prayer
[0:34] cloth, we all prayed over it, went there
[0:36] to the house and and they're they're of
[0:39] another flavor of religion that, you
[0:42] know, may not really believe about
[0:44] healing. And so we talked about taking
[0:46] the the things from the aprons from the
[0:49] body of Paul and and everything else
[0:51] about laying on of hands. Amen. And so
[0:54] we began to pray
[0:57] and the presence of God just came down
[1:01] mightily.
[1:03] And one of the brothers looked at me and
[1:05] says, "He's here." I said, "Yeah, I
[1:08] know." But here's the lesson.
[1:13] That's good.
[1:16] And you're going to say, "Brother,
[1:18] you're really going to say this?" Yeah,
[1:19] I'm going to say this.
[1:22] This is greater than that.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; I enjoy that. Don't we enjoy those
[1:26] times?
[1:27] &gt;&gt; We're nothing against that.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; But I want people to see this was the
[1:32] absolute of why she's now cancer free.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Stage four cancer gone.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The husband was kind of
[1:43] lerary of me at first and afterwards I
[1:45] go to shake his hand. He goes, "Come
[1:46] here." And we're so fat. It was just
[1:48] like, "Come here." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; It was his word that did it.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
