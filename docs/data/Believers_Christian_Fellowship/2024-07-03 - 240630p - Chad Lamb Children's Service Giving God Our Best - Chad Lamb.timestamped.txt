[7:45] thankful Lord You're so mindful of us
[7:48] and love us so much and we're so
[7:49] thankful we can be here together in this
[7:52] special service that we set aside for
[7:54] the children amongst us God we know that
[7:57] when you were here Lord the disciples
[7:59] thought that you might be too busy and
[8:00] under too much pressure to be bothered
[8:03] with the children but you rebuked them
[8:05] and you said suffer the little children
[8:07] to come unto me for of such is the
[8:10] kingdom of heaven and Lord You've showed
[8:12] us that you took the children into your
[8:14] arms and you picked them up and you
[8:15] bless them I pray that you do the same
[8:18] thing this afternoon that you would take
[8:19] all of these children into your arms
[8:21] Lord that you would lift them up and
[8:23] that you would bless them with a special
[8:25] blessing today I give myself to you I
[8:27] pray you use me as an instrument that
[8:29] can reach their hearts Lord that can
[8:32] drive your word to their souls that you
[8:34] can do something Lord blessed and
[8:36] beneficial and eternal in their lives
[8:39] today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[8:42] amen you can all sit
[8:46] down alrighty so is my first slide up
[8:50] all right we've got lots of pictures and
[8:52] some videos that we're going to go
[8:53] through today we're going to do a lesson
[8:56] on giving God our best and we're going
[8:58] to learn about
[9:00] uh somebody in the story called Blind
[9:01] bmas has anybody heard about blind raise
[9:04] your hand if you've heard about blind
[9:05] barus all right some of you had by the
[9:08] time we're done we'll all know about
[9:09] blind bmas because we're going to read
[9:11] about it and learn about it so we're
[9:14] going to start with this scripture that
[9:15] says we love him because he first loved
[9:19] us so who loved who first Who Loved You
[9:22] did you love Jesus first or did he love
[9:24] you first the Bible says he loved you
[9:27] first we love him because he Lov us
[9:29] first and so our love to him is just
[9:32] something we give back to him because he
[9:34] loved us first so we're going to learn
[9:36] today like I said about blind barnas I'm
[9:38] going to read a couple scriptures that
[9:40] talk about barnas and the scriptures and
[9:42] barnas was a blind man meaning he could
[9:45] not see he had no vision brother benam
[9:47] says some things about uh barus that
[9:50] we're going to learn together that's
[9:52] interesting he tells us more about his
[9:53] life and his background but barname
[9:55] wasn't born blind according to what the
[9:58] brother M told us that he could see when
[10:00] he was a little boy but something
[10:02] happened somewhere along the way and he
[10:04] lost his vision and now he could no
[10:06] longer see and and and there's a whole
[10:09] story behind it we're going to learn
[10:10] about that but here's what we know about
[10:12] him in the scriptures from uh The Book
[10:14] of Mark chapter 10 says and they came to
[10:18] Jericho and as he went out of Jericho
[10:21] with his disciples and a great number of
[10:23] people blind bmus the son of tus Sat by
[10:27] the highways side begging and when he he
[10:29] heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he
[10:31] began to cry out and say Jesus thou son
[10:33] of David have mercy on me and many he
[10:35] charged him that he should hold his
[10:38] peace but he cried the more a great deal
[10:40] thou son of David have mercy on me so we
[10:43] find out here that he's in Jericho and
[10:45] in Jericho it says that he was blind and
[10:48] also he was begging that means a a blind
[10:51] man in that day couldn't have a job he
[10:52] couldn't go out and do the kind of work
[10:55] that that they needed to do in that day
[10:57] so his only option was to beg and asked
[10:59] people to give him money out of the
[11:01] kindness of their heart and he was a
[11:03] beggar begging by the walls of Jericho
[11:05] but he heard that Jesus was passing by
[11:08] and inside he knew that this Jesus Son
[11:10] of David could help him so he started
[11:12] crying out and as he cried out for Jesus
[11:14] to help him the people nearby told him
[11:16] to be quiet but he wouldn't be quiet he
[11:19] cried out the more that s thing Jesus
[11:21] thou son of David have mercy on me and
[11:25] then and Jesus answered and said unto
[11:28] him what will thou that I should do unto
[11:31] thee and the blind man said unto him
[11:33] Lord that I might receive my sight and
[11:36] Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith
[11:38] hath made thee whole and immediately he
[11:41] received his sight and followed Jesus in
[11:43] the way now how exciting would that be
[11:45] can you imagine uh you all can see right
[11:49] you all can see me right you can see you
[11:51] know how wonderful it is to be able to
[11:53] see can you imagine if you wake up
[11:54] tomorrow and you couldn't see you
[11:57] couldn't see anything you couldn't see
[11:58] the sunrise the flowers you couldn't see
[12:00] Mom and Dad you couldn't see anything
[12:02] can you imagine you live your whole life
[12:03] like that but then one day Jesus passes
[12:06] by and as Jesus passes by you cry out
[12:08] and Jesus said to you what would you
[12:10] want me to do for you and you said Lord
[12:12] that I could see and he says your faith
[12:15] has made you whole and immediately he
[12:16] could see again do you know how exciting
[12:18] that would be that would be a thrill he
[12:20] would go home he would tell his family
[12:22] he would show everybody that he can see
[12:24] now and that's the story in the Bible of
[12:27] barus but it's beautiful that God gave
[12:30] us a prophet today that would tell us a
[12:31] little more we can go and listen to what
[12:34] brother Venom said and we get a little
[12:35] more of the
[12:37] story and here's what he here's what he
[12:39] said he said I read the history of blind
[12:42] barus one day a little story they said
[12:45] that he had been blind for years and he
[12:47] had a little daughter he had never seen
[12:50] apparently his little daughter was born
[12:51] after he lost his eyesight he never seen
[12:53] her face never knew what she looked like
[12:55] but he had a little daughter and it goes
[12:58] on to say he had two little turtle does
[13:01] and they would do little tumbles like
[13:03] that to attract the tourist attention
[13:06] going into Jerusalem or into the City
[13:08] and they would drop coins into his cup
[13:10] because he was blind so brother R said
[13:13] he had two little turtle does and
[13:15] because bmus couldn't go to work to earn
[13:18] money for his family he had a wife and
[13:20] he had a little girl and they had to buy
[13:23] their groceries they had to get the
[13:24] things that they needed to live and
[13:26] their clothes and things so what little
[13:29] uh uh what barus would do is he would
[13:31] sit in the corner of the street as
[13:32] people were passing by and he had little
[13:34] two little turtle does that would do
[13:37] that would do tricks he said they would
[13:38] tumble over one another and brother B
[13:40] said it this
[13:41] way he said uh blind barus had had two
[13:44] little tur Turtle does that turned
[13:47] little tumbles over each other and they
[13:49] would attract the attention of the
[13:51] passer by so this is how he would get
[13:53] money not just begging but he would do a
[13:56] little show with his little birds so
[13:58] that the people would be attracted Ed
[13:59] and they'd come over and they'd like
[14:00] what they seen and they would drop a few
[14:02] coins in his little cup and you want to
[14:04] see the the birds tumble I looked this
[14:08] up and I found this is a pigeon this is
[14:10] a tumbling pigeon and this is what it
[14:12] looks like this is played in slow motion
[14:14] so you can see what it's
[14:15] like it's getting ready to take
[14:18] off and look at
[14:21] that have you ever seen a bird do a
[14:26] backflip it's amazing
[14:29] these are called Tumblr pinons there's
[14:31] actually a thing they breed them and
[14:32] they have them and they tumble and and
[14:35] brother benam said that bmus had two of
[14:38] these little turtle doves and and they
[14:40] would tumble over one another and he
[14:42] would let them go and they would do a
[14:44] little show and he'd throw them in the
[14:45] air and they tumble over each other and
[14:46] then they would come back to him and
[14:48] that's why people would stop and watch
[14:50] his little show and and then he would
[14:52] ask them for something and they would
[14:53] drop a little bit of money into his
[14:55] thing and that's how he would earn his
[14:57] money and that's what he was doing to
[14:59] earn money but then brother Brenham says
[15:02] something he gives us some more
[15:03] information and he tells us that he had
[15:06] a little daughter remember he said he
[15:07] had a little daughter that he had never
[15:09] seen he said
[15:14] uh uh and he had a wife and and this is
[15:17] where brother said he said that one
[15:18] night bame's wife took real
[15:21] sick and he went along the side of the
[15:24] house and knelt down after the doctor
[15:25] had left and said that he didn't know
[15:28] what to do for her and he prayed to God
[15:30] and he said Lord if you'll just let my
[15:32] dear precious wife get well I promise
[15:35] you that I will take these two Turtle
[15:36] does and offer them to you for a
[15:40] sacrifice and it says his wife got well
[15:43] so here he is he's blind he he has no
[15:45] job he has very little he's got these
[15:48] two little turtle doves that he does
[15:49] this little show with to get a few coins
[15:52] so that they could live and and they're
[15:54] precious to him but he's also got a
[15:56] precious wife and a precious daughter
[15:58] and his wife wife got real sick like she
[16:00] was going to die and he didn't know what
[16:02] to do so he just prayed oh God will he
[16:04] just save my wife's life if she'll live
[16:06] I'll give you my two little doves and
[16:09] and it said that they lived that she
[16:11] lived and and so he took his two little
[16:15] turtle does and he took them up to the
[16:17] temple to give them to God and he would
[16:19] give them to the priest and the priest
[16:20] would offer them to God and now he would
[16:22] no longer have his Turtle does the the
[16:25] thing that he made his money by the
[16:26] little show that he had that would get
[16:29] him a few coins he gave it to God
[16:32] because he was so thankful for what God
[16:34] did for his wife he was so happy that
[16:37] his wife was alive that he made a pledge
[16:40] to God and he wanted to give God the
[16:41] very best that he have he didn't give
[16:43] him one of the old coins that somebody
[16:45] dropped in there but he gave him
[16:47] something that was precious to him he
[16:48] gave him these two little turtle doves
[16:51] and now he has no way to make his money
[16:54] he has no little show he has no tumbling
[16:57] uh uh doves to entertain the people or
[17:00] attract their attention so now all he
[17:01] can do is beg and just ask them to
[17:03] please give him money so it gets worse
[17:06] for him but then brother Brenham goes on
[17:08] to tell us something else about barus
[17:11] that I didn't know he
[17:14] said he said he used to go up there and
[17:16] sit on the street he had a little
[17:18] lamb and the lamb used to lead the blind
[17:21] people like the dogs does today the dogs
[17:24] that lead the blind they had a lamb
[17:26] trained to do that to lead the blind and
[17:30] he says in another place he said also in
[17:34] this day we find that a blind person is
[17:36] led by a dog that's trained to take them
[17:38] across the street and and brother Ben
[17:40] says I forget what you call that he says
[17:42] seeing ey in those days instead of
[17:44] having a train dog they had a trained
[17:46] sheep that led them have you ever seen a
[17:49] dog lead a blind person a seeing eye dog
[17:52] I got a little video of it so you can
[17:53] watch and see these These are amazing
[17:56] dogs they're trained to help blind
[17:57] people move around the city so here's a
[18:00] little story about a a little seeing ey
[18:03] dog I'm finally living my dream I'm not
[18:06] like any ordinary pet I'm a guide dog I
[18:09] work with a blind partner helping him
[18:12] throughout his day crossing
[18:14] streets navigating
[18:17] sidewalks going around obstacles and
[18:20] running errands we work together to
[18:23] accomplish all of this but to be sure we
[18:26] remain safe I need to stay focused on my
[18:29] work at all times that's why I'm trained
[18:31] to ignore other dogs stopping to play
[18:34] with them would be really distracting
[18:37] and that could be dangerous for my
[18:38] partner and me please help us stay safe
[18:43] remember to keep your dog away from me
[18:45] when I'm at
[18:51] work wow it's pretty nice dog isn't it
[18:54] and brother B said they have dogs that
[18:57] do that now but back in that they D dogs
[18:59] they used a little lamb they would have
[19:00] a little lamb or a sheep that would
[19:02] guide them to keep them from walking
[19:04] down a set the steps or falling off of a
[19:07] a hill or bumping into something they
[19:09] would just have this little lamb and
[19:11] this little sheep would guide them
[19:12] because he couldn't see with his eyes so
[19:15] he had he had things that helped him
[19:17] when he was blind one was his two little
[19:19] turtle doves that he could earn money by
[19:21] but he gave those to God for saving the
[19:23] life of his wife then he had this little
[19:25] lamb that he loved and if you were blind
[19:27] then this little lamb LED you around
[19:29] that would be a pretty important lamb to
[19:31] you wouldn't it what if you were blind
[19:33] and had a seeing ey dog that would be a
[19:34] pretty important dog you wouldn't want
[19:36] to leave the house without it because
[19:38] you could fall off the stairs you could
[19:40] trip over something you could bump into
[19:42] somebody you could walk out into traffic
[19:44] and get hit by a car this little dog was
[19:47] was the little dog was helping the blind
[19:49] but in barnabas' day it was the little
[19:52] lamb that was helping him and so it was
[19:54] precious and valuable and really a good
[19:57] help to him but brother random goes on
[19:59] to tell us he says sometime later that
[20:03] his little daughter got sick so remember
[20:06] the most precious things to barnas was
[20:08] his little turtle does his little seeing
[20:10] ey lamb his wife and his little girl his
[20:15] wife had already got sick but God saved
[20:16] her and in Thanksgiving he offered God
[20:19] his two little turtle does but now his
[20:21] little girl is sick one of the most
[20:24] precious things in the world to him he
[20:25] says sometime later his little girl
[20:27] daughter got sick very seriously ill
[20:29] with a fever and he went out to the side
[20:32] of the house again and prayed and said
[20:33] Lord I don't have nothing left but my
[20:36] lamb if you just let me my baby live I
[20:40] promise you that I'll take my lamb and
[20:41] give it as a sacrifice upon the Altar
[20:44] and as a little story goes his daughter
[20:46] got well and on his road to the church
[20:50] to offer the sacrifice he met the priest
[20:52] and he says where are you going blind
[20:55] bmas and here goes blind bmus up to the
[20:59] temple carrying his little lamb because
[21:01] what was the promise he made God if
[21:03] you'll save my little girl I'll give you
[21:05] my lamb and here he goes happy because
[21:08] his little girl lived happy to give God
[21:10] the very best sacrifice he can give him
[21:13] cuz he's so thankful that his girl is
[21:15] alive that he takes something that's so
[21:17] precious to him and so meaningful and
[21:19] the most precious thing he has outside
[21:21] of his wife and his daughter is this
[21:23] little lamb and he's taking it up to
[21:25] give the very best Thanksgiving offering
[21:28] he can to God is his little lamb and he
[21:31] meets a priest and the priest tries to
[21:33] change his mind and here's what he says
[21:36] the priest said uh he said priest I go
[21:39] to the Temple of the Lord to give my
[21:40] lamb to God and the priest said barname
[21:44] thou cannot give your lamb the lamb is
[21:47] your eyes he said I'll give you money to
[21:50] buy a lamb you go to the Stalls and buy
[21:52] a lamb and offer it because the lamb is
[21:54] your eyes so what the priest was telling
[21:57] him is when you go to the temple because
[21:59] they would offer lambs and they would
[22:01] offer doves all the time to God back in
[22:04] that Day in Israel they that's what
[22:05] their offering was to God that's what
[22:07] they would give and they would have
[22:09] people that had little stalls set up
[22:10] outside the temple and you can go take
[22:13] some money buy a lamb take the lamb give
[22:15] it to the priest and the priest will
[22:17] give it to God and that would be their
[22:19] sacrifice and the priest says don't give
[22:21] this lamb to God this lamb is your eyes
[22:23] you need it to walk around you need this
[22:26] lamb uh he says don't do that I'll give
[22:28] you you some money and you just go up
[22:30] there to the temple and buy a lamb and
[22:32] just give a lamb to God and barus
[22:35] wouldn't do it he says no I didn't just
[22:36] promise God a lamb I promised him my
[22:39] lamb I promised that I would give him
[22:41] the very best thing that I have and and
[22:44] barus said I'm grateful thank you for
[22:46] your kindness that you're showing me but
[22:49] I'm going to offer this lamb to
[22:52] God and then he tried again he says but
[22:55] you can't do that because this lamb is
[22:57] your eyes' and he said oh servant of God
[23:00] this is bamus now he says I will I will
[23:03] keep my promise to God God will provide
[23:06] a lamb for my eyes he knew that if I
[23:09] just in Thanksgiving give God my best
[23:12] God will take care of me God's already
[23:14] taken care of him he's already saved his
[23:15] wife's life he already saved his little
[23:17] girl's life and baramas is so thankful
[23:20] he wants to give something of Great
[23:22] Value to God not something cheap not one
[23:25] of the coins somebody drops in his cup
[23:27] not the money the priest would give him
[23:29] to go buy another lamb but he wants to
[23:31] give the very best gift he can give to
[23:33] God and that very best gift is his own
[23:35] lamb and so he walks up there with the
[23:38] lamb and he and he gives it he gives it
[23:43] to
[23:44] God and now he has to go to
[23:47] begging and he has no turtle doves he
[23:50] has no lamb he's got to you find his way
[23:54] around the street without a seeing ey
[23:57] lamb to guide him probably he would
[24:00] imagine miss the lamb all the time as he
[24:02] would bump into something or or or run
[24:05] into a wall or maybe trip over something
[24:08] that the lamb would have taken him
[24:09] around fall into a a shallow hole and
[24:12] all of a sudden now he's missing this
[24:14] lamb but he thanks God because he's got
[24:16] his little girl and he's got his wife
[24:17] and God's been so good to him and
[24:20] brother bam tells us the story of bmus
[24:23] he says he's sitting by the walls of
[24:25] Jericho this is the day that Jesus comes
[24:27] by and this is what he's thinking about
[24:29] so he began to think of something like
[24:31] this how that when he was a little boy
[24:34] out there on the hills of J Judea the
[24:36] little yellow flowers and how he used to
[24:38] go out as a little child and he would
[24:40] pick those little flowers how pretty
[24:42] they were and especially when they were
[24:43] just coming up in the spring and how he
[24:45] would see the blue skies and would
[24:47] wonder how far it was up to the skies
[24:50] but since that day his sight's been shut
[24:52] off from such so he was sitting there at
[24:54] Jericho remembering what it was like
[24:56] when he was a little boy to see the
[24:57] pretty flowers and the blue
[25:01] skies and then he begins to remember
[25:04] about being a child and he remembers
[25:06] great things of his childhood of how his
[25:09] beautiful little Jewish mother used to
[25:10] get him up in her arms after his midday
[25:12] lunch and would sat out on the front
[25:14] porch and rock him and get get him to
[25:17] take his nap and tell him Bible stories
[25:19] of the great Jehovah God that how God
[25:22] had led their people out of the bondage
[25:24] of Egypt and had brought them into a
[25:25] great land that they lived and he just
[25:27] loved to hear those stories and one that
[25:31] he liked so well was to think when just
[25:33] down at the bottom of the hill at the
[25:34] Ford there was where the Jehovah God
[25:36] rolled back the Jordan and held it up at
[25:39] a standstill until the mighty Joshua and
[25:41] his marching Army of Israel crossed over
[25:43] he loved those stories of the power of
[25:45] God then there was another
[25:49] one there was another one that he liked
[25:52] real well in the Bible it was told about
[25:54] a woman and she was a shunamite woman
[25:55] and she had a little boy such as he was
[25:58] and oh how his mama would tell him these
[26:00] stories and his little eyes would snap
[26:02] as they looked her in the pretty face he
[26:04] was remembering about all the great
[26:06] stories of the Bible all the wonderful
[26:08] things that God had done but as he's
[26:11] sitting there up against the wall with
[26:12] no lamb and no doves and begging for
[26:14] some coins all of a sudden he hears a
[26:16] great crowd coming and the crowd is
[26:19] making a lot of noise and he's wondering
[26:21] what is all this noise about and
[26:23] somebody tells him that Jesus is coming
[26:26] Jesus the son of David is coming and and
[26:28] maybe he had heard some things about
[26:30] Jesus and when they told him the son of
[26:32] David is coming all of a sudden he gets
[26:34] excited because he's just thinking about
[26:35] all the great things that God did in the
[26:37] Bible how he brought them out of Egypt
[26:40] how he made the water stand up in the
[26:42] Red Sea so they could draw cross on dry
[26:44] ground how they stopped the water from
[26:46] flowing in Jordan so they could cross
[26:48] all these wonderful things and now he
[26:51] begins to cry out and he says Thou son
[26:54] of David have mercy on me son son of
[26:58] David have mercy on me and they try to
[27:01] get him to be quiet but he won't be
[27:03] quiet he keeps screaming oh son of David
[27:06] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[27:10] and then Jesus
[27:12] stops Jesus stops he heard his cry and
[27:16] brother man tells us there was so many
[27:18] people crying there was noise everywhere
[27:20] they were saying uh all kinds of things
[27:23] about Jesus coming there was a great
[27:25] crowd but through all the noise Jesus
[27:27] heard heard the voice of blind bardus
[27:30] crying thou son of David have mercy and
[27:33] he stops and he bids him to come and and
[27:35] they tell him with excitement he's
[27:37] calling for you and they bring him to
[27:39] Jesus and Jesus
[27:41] says what is it that you want he asked
[27:44] what what can I do for you he said Lord
[27:47] that I might see and here's what brother
[27:49] BM said he said that I might receive my
[27:51] sight and he said why your faith has
[27:53] already made you whole what was it God
[27:57] had provided a lamb for blind barus who
[28:01] was the lamb Jesus was the lamb Jesus
[28:05] knew what barame is needed and there's
[28:07] no time ever that you can give something
[28:10] to God that God won't take care of you
[28:14] amen he gave up his turtle doves now he
[28:16] has no income he gave up his lamb he has
[28:19] no way to find his way around but Jesus
[28:22] already knew what he was going to do for
[28:24] barus barus the god provided a lamb for
[28:28] bame's eyes and that lamb was Jesus
[28:31] Christ because Jesus was going to give
[28:33] his life for the sins of the world so
[28:35] that we all could have life and now
[28:37] Jesus comes along and barus cries out
[28:41] and God doesn't forget what barus did he
[28:44] doesn't forget about the doves and he
[28:46] doesn't forget about the Lambs but he
[28:48] hears his cry amongst all the cries that
[28:51] were going on he hears this one who
[28:53] loved him so much that he gave his best
[28:56] loved him so much that was so thankful
[28:58] to God that He gave everything he had
[29:00] and God now comes to him and gives him
[29:03] back what what barname could never have
[29:05] beli could never have received his sight
[29:08] now he could see he could go home and
[29:10] see his lovely wife's face he could go
[29:12] home and see his little daughter that he
[29:14] had never seen before because Jesus came
[29:17] by God had provided for barnas a lamb
[29:21] not one that would lead him around blind
[29:22] but one that would open his eyes so that
[29:24] he would never stumble around blind
[29:27] again
[29:28] amen there's another story that Jesus
[29:31] tells his disciples it's this story here
[29:34] he says and Jesus sat over against the
[29:36] treasury and beheld how the people cast
[29:39] money into the treasury that's the
[29:41] offering basket there was an offering
[29:43] set up in the temple where when people
[29:45] come in they would give an offering to
[29:47] God and that's the treasury and many
[29:50] there were Rich cast in much and there
[29:52] came a certain poor Widow and she threw
[29:54] in two mites and which make a farthing
[29:57] and he called unto his disciples and
[29:59] saith unto them verily I say unto you
[30:02] that this poor Widow hath cast more in
[30:04] than all they which have cast into the
[30:06] treasury for all they did cast in of
[30:08] their abundance but she of her want did
[30:11] cast in all that she had even all her
[30:14] living here we have a a little widow she
[30:17] has nothing and while Jesus was there
[30:19] all the rich people were coming in and
[30:22] maybe they would bring out big bags of
[30:23] money like this full of gold coins and
[30:26] they wanted everybody to see see how
[30:28] much they give so they would open it up
[30:30] and they'd make a lot of noise as they
[30:31] shook it out so everybody could see they
[30:33] gave a lot of money and the Bible says
[30:35] they gave much but they had much they
[30:38] had tons and tons of money so they would
[30:41] take some of their money and they would
[30:42] give and they wanted everybody to see
[30:44] what they had but the way brother B
[30:46] tells us the story is this little widow
[30:48] she didn't have bags of money she didn't
[30:51] have gold coins she didn't have anything
[30:53] she had two little coins and that's all
[30:56] she had and she took her two little
[30:58] coins and she didn't make any noise she
[31:01] didn't say hey look at me she didn't she
[31:03] didn't rattle the coins together all she
[31:05] did was slip up there and she just
[31:07] dropped in her coins for nobody to see
[31:10] because she was a little bit embarrassed
[31:12] that she didn't have as much as
[31:13] everybody else had can you imagine if
[31:16] you're going to the treasury and
[31:17] everybody is blowing a trumpet
[31:20] announcing that I'm coming to give my
[31:22] offering and they shake out hundreds and
[31:24] hundreds of coins into the treasury and
[31:26] everybody can see it falling and they're
[31:28] smiling as everybody's looking at them
[31:30] I'm giving so much to God can you
[31:32] imagine how embarrassed the woman was
[31:34] while she just looked down at these two
[31:35] little coin she had in her hand she
[31:37] didn't have big bags of money she didn't
[31:40] have anything but this is all she had so
[31:43] when nobody was looking when nobody was
[31:45] paying attention she slipped over to the
[31:47] treasury and she dropped her little
[31:49] coins in and moved away because she
[31:52] couldn't she couldn't do anything
[31:54] special like everybody else did she
[31:55] didn't have anything special she didn't
[31:57] have much
[31:58] so she slipped in she dropped it and
[32:01] then she slipped
[32:03] away but guess who saw it who did the
[32:07] Bible say saw that somebody want to
[32:10] guess God God saw it you're right Jesus
[32:14] was standing there and Jesus got the
[32:16] attention of his disciples and said you
[32:18] see this little woman you see all the
[32:20] money all these people are putting in
[32:22] they this little woman gave more money
[32:25] than they
[32:26] did and they were put bags of money in
[32:29] she just had two coins but Jesus saw
[32:32] that they gave because they had much to
[32:34] give she gave everything she had this
[32:37] was this was like bame's two Turtle does
[32:39] and his little lamb everything she
[32:42] didn't give she didn't have a pocket
[32:44] full of money and she just pulled out
[32:45] one coin and gave it she emptied her
[32:47] pocket of everything and dropped it in
[32:49] and you know who saw it Jesus saw it
[32:53] Jesus saw it because she gave her best
[32:55] to God and Jesus made no and she's
[32:58] mentioned in the Bible and God said she
[33:00] gave more than anybody else because she
[33:03] gave her best when we give something to
[33:07] God it doesn't it it doesn't matter how
[33:09] fancy it is or compared to how much
[33:11] somebody else gives but when we give to
[33:14] God our very best God knows how much we
[33:17] gave he knows we gave our best the
[33:20] others weren't giving their best they
[33:22] were just giving a little bit if you
[33:25] have a million dollars and you give a
[33:27] couple dollars that's not much if all
[33:29] you've got is $2 and you give that you
[33:31] gave everything so she gave all but
[33:35] there was somebody else who gave
[33:37] something to God that was very precious
[33:39] and they gave
[33:41] all and it was
[33:43] Abraham back in the Book of Genesis God
[33:47] tests Abraham and he tells Abraham take
[33:50] thy son thine only son and take it and
[33:53] offer your son to me as a sacrifice give
[33:56] me your son
[33:58] and this boy was everything to Abraham
[34:01] Abraham had received the promise from
[34:03] God 25 years before he was born that he
[34:06] was going to have a son and that he
[34:07] would have a son by his wife Sarah and
[34:10] here comes the son little Isaac and
[34:12] little Isaac is the the most precious
[34:14] thing that Abraham has in the world and
[34:17] God tests him and says Abraham why don't
[34:21] you give me your son and Abraham doesn't
[34:24] hesitate he he immediately he gets too
[34:27] servants and they saddle up their donkey
[34:29] and they start the long trip to mount
[34:31] Mariah cuz he's going to give his son to
[34:34] God and and he goes up on top of the
[34:38] mountain and we know Isaac is there and
[34:41] Isaac is carrying the wood and they're
[34:43] walking up and at the end of The Journey
[34:45] there's no more servants it's just
[34:46] Abraham and just his his little lamb his
[34:50] precious son his most valuable thing and
[34:53] he's taking it up to give it to God and
[34:56] they go up and they make the altar for
[34:57] the sacrifice and they lay Isaac down
[35:00] and everything's there and he's just
[35:02] about to give Isaac to God completely
[35:04] when the angel the Lord stops him and
[35:06] says Abraham stop and this is what he
[35:09] said and the angel of the Lord called
[35:11] unto him out of heaven and said Abraham
[35:15] Abraham and he said here am I and he
[35:18] said lay not thy hand upon the lad
[35:20] neither do thou anything unto him for
[35:23] now I know that thou fearest God seeing
[35:25] thou has not withheld thy son
[35:28] thine only son for me and all of a
[35:31] sudden when when Abraham was going to
[35:34] give his very best gift that he could
[35:37] possibly give to God God sees the heart
[35:40] of Abraham and he stops him and he says
[35:43] stop now I know that you love me and
[35:46] does anybody remember what God gives
[35:48] Abraham instead of Isaac
[35:52] yes he gives him a lamb he gives him a
[35:54] Ram with his horns stop uh stuck in the
[35:58] thicket all of a sudden brother bham
[36:02] said they had been up on top of the
[36:03] mountain and the mountain was Bare it's
[36:05] not a mountain with trees it was just
[36:06] Rocky on top and they could see forever
[36:09] and they gathered a bunch of rocks and
[36:10] they had they had made an altar and they
[36:12] stacked it all up they had worked for
[36:14] quite a while and while they were there
[36:16] there was no other animals there there
[36:17] was nothing there just Abraham and his
[36:19] son and they piled the Rocks up and they
[36:21] piled the wood up and they did
[36:23] everything and then Abraham goes to
[36:25] offer his own precious dear son and then
[36:27] all of a sudden God says stop and When
[36:30] God says stop he says now I know that
[36:32] thou love me and as soon as he said stop
[36:34] he turned and looked and this is what he
[36:36] saw there was a a ram a lamb a sheep
[36:39] with his horn stuck in the vine stuck in
[36:42] the bush and he couldn't get out and God
[36:45] saw what Abraham was doing and God now
[36:48] gave a lamb to Abraham to use as a
[36:51] substitute for Isaac now he didn't have
[36:54] to give Isaac to God now he could take
[36:56] the lamb that God provided and he could
[36:59] give the lamb back to God and now Isaac
[37:02] could live and Isaac could stay with his
[37:04] dad see it's important that we give our
[37:08] best to God but if we give our best to
[37:10] God he gives his best to us and he's
[37:13] already given us the best thing he could
[37:15] give us because God has already given us
[37:18] a lamb in Abraham's day he had to be
[37:21] tested whether or not he would give the
[37:23] very best you know barus he gave his
[37:28] very best everything he had to God and
[37:31] God saw it he get it because he was
[37:34] thankful to God because he loved God but
[37:36] God saw it and God gave him his sight
[37:39] back the two the woman with the two
[37:41] little MIT and two little coins she gave
[37:43] the very best she had and God saw it and
[37:45] he mentioned it in the
[37:47] Bible Abraham gave the very best his own
[37:50] son he gave it to God and God saw it and
[37:53] God gave Abraham a lamb that he could
[37:55] use instead
[37:57] but God knew that we needed saved that
[38:01] we needed life and so God gave us his
[38:05] lamb Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God and
[38:09] God gave a lamb instead of us do you
[38:12] know Abraham's son was Isaac and Isaac
[38:16] was going to be offered as a sacrifice
[38:18] but God gave a lamb with his horn stuck
[38:21] in the thicket instead it was a
[38:23] substitute now instead of Isaac give the
[38:25] lamb and Isaac can live
[38:28] well you know what God did he gave Jesus
[38:31] on top of the mountain and Jesus is the
[38:34] Lamb that was given for me you remember
[38:37] when you sang Father Abraham a few
[38:39] minutes ago Father Abraham had many sons
[38:43] I am one of them and so are you you know
[38:46] what the Bible says that if we have the
[38:49] faith of Abraham if we believe God like
[38:51] Abraham then we're children of Abraham
[38:53] so we're children of Abraham like Isaac
[38:56] was a child of Abraham and Isaac was
[38:58] going to be given as a sacrifice on the
[39:00] altar but God said nope I'll give you a
[39:03] lamb instead and Isaac can go free and
[39:06] now we're children of Abraham and you
[39:08] know what God has done he's provided
[39:10] Jesus Christ in our place now he becomes
[39:12] the lamb so we can go
[39:15] free man I don't know about you but that
[39:18] makes me very thankful you know what it
[39:21] makes me want to do it makes me want to
[39:24] give God my
[39:25] best when
[39:28] when Bemus knew that his wife was going
[39:30] to live he gave God his best as a thank
[39:34] you when he found out his little girl
[39:37] who was so sick that she might die when
[39:39] he found out that she was going to live
[39:41] you know what he did he gave his very
[39:43] best as a thank
[39:45] you but you know what because of sin
[39:48] because of failure because of the
[39:49] mistakes that were made and what we all
[39:53] make we had to die we couldn't live
[39:56] forever we couldn't live because of our
[39:58] sin because of our failure because we
[40:00] would lie because we would do all kinds
[40:02] of wrong
[40:03] things but God made a way that we could
[40:06] live we could live we could live forever
[40:09] we could have eternal life we could go
[40:11] back to God but somebody had to give a
[40:15] gift and it was God and he gave his lamb
[40:18] up just like baramas gave his and his
[40:21] lamb was Jesus Christ and he died for
[40:23] you and
[40:25] me and now sometimes I think think what
[40:28] can I give
[40:29] God God's given me life he died for me
[40:33] so that I could go free so that I could
[40:35] receive his life and me that I he paid
[40:38] the price for me he took my place just
[40:41] like that just like this sheep took the
[40:46] place of
[40:47] Isaac this lamb took my
[40:50] place now what can I give to
[40:53] him baramas had two doves he had a lamb
[40:58] but what do I have that God
[41:01] wants I mean should I should I give him
[41:04] my car God doesn't need a car should I
[41:06] what should I give him when I think
[41:09] about it the best thing that I can give
[41:12] God is
[41:14] myself I've got this life that he's
[41:17] given me he's allowed me to live on this
[41:19] Earth he he's given me this body that I
[41:22] live in this mind that I have these eyes
[41:24] this mouth these hands he's given me
[41:26] this life life I don't know anything
[41:28] better to give God than to give him
[41:31] myself so that I can be the lamb that I
[41:34] give back to
[41:36] God and the Bible says this in Romans 12
[41:41] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[41:44] mercies of God that you present your
[41:45] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[41:49] acceptable to God which is your reasonal
[41:51] service which means you give yourself to
[41:55] God you you give the very best that you
[41:58] can we can give God a little bit of
[42:03] money but why don't we just give him
[42:06] everything we can give a few coins we
[42:09] can give him a little bit of time we can
[42:10] say okay I'll give him every Sunday I'll
[42:13] go to Sunday school and I'll go to
[42:14] church and then I'll give him Wednesday
[42:16] too I'll come to church on Wednesday and
[42:17] so I'm going to give God some of my time
[42:20] or I'll give God some of my
[42:23] money but God doesn't need money and God
[42:26] lives in eternity he doesn't need time
[42:29] do you know what I think God would want
[42:31] more than anything from you I think God
[42:34] wants you I think God wants you to give
[42:37] you yourself to him give your heart to
[42:39] him give your life to him give all of
[42:41] yourself to him to live for him to love
[42:43] him to let him have his way with you to
[42:46] love his word and to obey his word and
[42:48] to surrender all to him and say God I
[42:52] don't know what else to give you I don't
[42:53] know what gift you would like I don't
[42:55] know how much money is enough I don't I
[42:57] how much time is enough but I know one
[42:58] thing you've given me this life I want
[43:01] to give myself to
[43:03] you man I'd like to pray together but I
[43:05] would like everybody to Bow your heads
[43:07] with me if you could close your eyes
[43:09] close your eyes everybody close your
[43:11] eyes bow your head everybody close your
[43:15] eyes bow your
[43:18] head I don't know about you but I'm
[43:20] thankful that God gave a lamb for
[43:23] me I'm thankful that because of Jes
[43:27] Jesus Christ dying for me if I can
[43:29] believe that he died in my place that I
[43:32] can have eternal life I'm so thankful
[43:35] that all my mistakes all my wrongs Jesus
[43:39] paid for it
[43:41] all and I want to give something to
[43:44] him and I've already given Jesus myself
[43:48] I've already given my life to him my
[43:50] heart everything that I am I want him to
[43:52] have it I want him to have all of me CU
[43:55] he paid for me
[43:58] but I'm wondering about each one of
[44:00] you as boys and
[44:03] girls how many of you want to give
[44:05] something to Jesus how many of you would
[44:08] like to give him the best thing that you
[44:10] could give him keep your eyes closed and
[44:12] your heads bowed and I'm just going to
[44:15] ask you if you want to give yourself as
[44:17] a gift to Jesus just raise your hand
[44:20] just raise your hand Jesus will see your
[44:22] hand and you're just going to show Jesus
[44:24] Lord I don't know what else to bring you
[44:26] I don't know what better gift to give
[44:28] but I want to give myself to you I want
[44:31] you to have me and use me any way you
[44:34] want live through
[44:36] me I want you to have my best of my time
[44:40] and my thinking and all my energy I want
[44:41] to give myself to
[44:43] you and so you can put your hands down
[44:45] now Jesus sees your hands and I'm just
[44:49] going to pray with you but when I pray I
[44:50] want you to pray in your heart that
[44:52] you're going to give yourself to Jesus
[44:54] for the rest of your life that you're
[44:57] he's going to be Lord of your life and
[44:59] king of your life and you're going to
[45:00] serve him with your whole life so I'm
[45:02] going to pray over you but you pray in

[45:21] could give but you gave him the best you
[45:25] gave him his wife and and his daughter
[45:27] and you even gave him his eyes you
[45:30] noticed everything Lord you never missed
