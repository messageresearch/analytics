[0:00] brother man begins to tell us about
[0:03] being in the
[0:04] spirit because I want that Spirit to
[0:07] fully possess
[0:08] me he says have you ever noticed how the
[0:11] world gets into the spirit of things
[0:12] that are in the world they go to their
[0:14] ball games they sporting events and
[0:15] their dances they enter into the spirit
[0:17] of it they don't sit there like a
[0:19] Wallflower old dried up sticks they
[0:21] enter right into the feeling of things
[0:23] and become a part of things but oh how
[0:26] they hate the Christians for getting
[0:27] into the spirit of God's word they call
[0:30] Fanatics and holy rollers there's
[0:31] nothing they won't do to show their
[0:33] hatred and disapproval but ignore that
[0:36] you can expect it knowing where it come
[0:38] from just go on and get in the spirit of
[0:40] worship remember remember starts to tell
[0:42] us and he has different places that he
[0:44] describes this but he says you know how
[0:46] they go to a ball game and and the ball
[0:48] game is no fun unless you get in the
[0:50] spirit of the game you can be the guy
[0:52] sitting there trying to read a newspaper
[0:55] and then you know everybody else and
[0:56] they look at you like you're the odd
[0:57] duck and what's wrong with you this is
[0:59] why I don't get invited over to watch
[1:01] football
[1:02] games nobody invites me over because
[1:05] they'll be watching the game I'll be
[1:06] like what's happening and I don't I mean
[1:08] I used to be way into it but that's
[1:10] completely gone out of my heart and my
[1:11] mind now and they'll be like this player
[1:14] this and he did this and he's drafted
[1:16] from this and he's going there and for
[1:17] me there's just an absolute I don't care
[1:20] amen not that you're evil if you care
[1:22] I'm not saying that but I'm no fun at a
[1:24] ball game cuz I'm not going to get into
[1:26] the spirit of it amen but if you're
[1:28] going to get into the spirit of it
[1:30] you've got to enter in yeah you've got
[1:33] to know who's playing on the field yeah
[1:35] amen like you can't enter in unless you
[1:38] know what's going on unless you you
[1:40] you've been involved unless you entered
[1:42] into what's happening and you know the
[1:44] rules of the game and you know you know
[1:46] the odds are the favors this and this
[1:48] and blah blah blah and this is an old
[1:50] rivalry that goes like 30 years and when
[1:52] you get into it it gets more exciting
[1:54] and more exciting and more exciting then
[1:56] all of a sudden you can have grown men
[1:57] amen they see a man carry a piece of
[2:00] leather with air in it across the line
[2:02] and grown men jump up in their plate of
[2:04] nachos and chips and everything goes
[2:06] flying all over the
[2:08] place I mean that doesn't happen every
[2:10] time you sit down to dinner you don't
[2:11] just jump up and throw your food
[2:13] everywhere what happened they got into
[2:15] the spirit amen and that Spirit took
[2:19] control yeah and began to express itself
[2:22] through their vocal cords and through
[2:23] their
[2:24] body if that can happen at a ball game
[2:27] can it happen about the word of God can
[2:29] we get so in the spirit can we get so
[2:31] engrossed in what God's done in this a
[2:33] that we read about it we study about it
[2:35] we talk about it we Fellowship about it
[2:38] we go to church we sing songs about it
[2:39] we worship about it until somebody will
[2:42] come to the pull pit and read a
[2:43] scripture and read a quote and say a
[2:45] statement and you'll jump out of your
[2:46] seat and say amen that's nothing but the
[2:48] truth if you had nachos and hot dogs in
[2:50] your lap guess where they would be
[2:53] amen because we've got to get into the
[2:55] spirit to let the spirit take control
[2:57] and let the spirit have expression and
[2:59] move every other Spirit out of the way I
[3:01] want to become a fanatic for one thing
[3:04] and that's for my bridegroom for this
[3:05] message of the hour which is the
[3:07] anointed word which is Christ himself
[3:09] coming to manifest what was the Word of
[3:12] Promise to Mary it was he himself coming
[3:14] to manifest himself what is this message
[3:16] friends it is he himself coming to
[3:19] manifest himself in the Virgin bride
[3:21] amen and it's not about me it's about
[3:24] him it's not my life it's his life it's
[3:27] not what I do it's what he's already
[3:29] done
