but god bless you we love you all man it's good to be together amen it's good to love the word it's good to have the lord on your side amen amen let's take our bibles and turn to second peter and we'll just get right into the word if you read second peter chapter one i just want to give you an update i talked to brother gene yesterday and he got back home on friday so brother gene petrie is home in recovering he had a bad case of double pneumonia and he's still recovering he's still got a recovery ahead of him they sent him home with oxygen i didn't find out what he was using or how much he needed but but keep praying for him as recovers and also his daughter sonya is improving amen and so she's doing well and improving so we thank god for that she was able just to stay there at home and get better so praise god god is good we thank him for that also as we pray for the service this morning for the word we want to remember brother kyle brother kyle was preaching for brother eugene braun this morning in a lockdown with no airplane you know so brother eugene's church is in edmonton but he's preaching through skype or something like that and so it's a new experience you know he's done some bible studies and brother ron have done bible studies and skype to pakistan but he's going to take the sunday morning service in an empty room with a laptop and so he would definitely cover your prayers and so i had an invitation to do the same for a church in new zealand and i'm letting kyle go first to see how it works and then we'll then we'll pray about it and see what god wants us to do but this is a different world we live in it's unusual and god is getting on us getting us out of our comfort zones and putting us in uncomfortable places and we're finding out that the word works amen the word works and so let's look at first peter or second peter chapter 1 verse 12. wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth with key on present truth they were established in something but it wasn't the past truth they were established in the present truth amen let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this privilege to read your word lord and and just to be able to have a bible and literacy and an ability to read is a privilege in itself but god we're asking for more than this we're asking that you would come and give us divine revelation on your word that you would give us eyes have to see that you would open our understanding and reveal to us your word and lord and that we could place it in our lives and that we could live by it in this day we love you we pray to take preeminence among us and whether you would have your way in jesus name we pray amen god bless you as you're seated i want to thank sister naomi for that song that was a blessing man god is so good i want to take for a subject if we can this morning the worst sickness of all the worst sickness of all brother ben says in the message why 1961 said i will say today they say the number one killer is heart disease i don't believe the number one killer is heart disease i believe number one killer is sin disease that's the killer that unbelief that's what's killing people we got the best doctors we ever had the best medicine we ever had certainly the best hospitals we ever had and the best medicines to practice with we've ever had and we got more sickness than we've ever had because we got more unbelief than we ever had that's exactly true see it is number one killer isn't heart trouble its sin trouble is the number one killer amen we believe that so the worst sickness of all to strike humanity amen it's not cancer it's not tuberculosis it's not leukemia it's not any of those things the work sickness is unbelief the worst thing that we could have is unbelief amen and the best thing that we could have is as a as a measure of faith that's been put into us by his grace as a gift of god to believe his word amen because unbelief will take your life amen unbelief will will will get will create everything that we see around us that's falling apart it is based on a civilization of unbelief but faith will get us out of all of it amen faith will give us the final victory that will free us from everything that unbelief has created amen brother bam says in the invisible union of the bride of christ what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word amen so this to disbelieve the word is to disbelieve god because god is the word amen all the way back to john chapter one verse one in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god amen and so god is the word amen and to disbelieve to word is to disbelieve god amen but but we realize that all the way down through time god has been unveiling his word and he's been portioning it out and measures through through the generations through the dispensations of time and salvation was always based on believing the word for your day it always has been through the entire bible nothing has changed amen salvation has always been by faith and the present truth if you look in noah's day salvation was faith in the present truth in abraham's day faith in the present truth moses day faith in the present truth amen all the way up all the way through the church ages it's always been based on faith in the present truth and today is no exception amen our salvation is based on faith in the present truth which is the word of god and when the word is made manifest it has to be believed amen when it's when it's disbelieved it's the same as rejecting god sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word let's go to hebrews chapter 11. i'd like to read several scriptures here close together hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1. now hebrews 11 and 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report hallelujah how did all the elders get a good report by faith faith in what faith in the word as it was presented to them in their day amen this is so important i mean we've hounded this we know this this is something we talked about but it never changes it never goes away it's the fact that they they that all of the elders all the way down through and if you read the the hall of fame here chapter in hebrews 11 every one of them had to accept a manifestation of the word in their day and when they accepted that amen they were they were considered righteous they mean they they were saved by faith they've always been saved by faith we'll always be saved by faith amen so it's always salvation by faith but it was never their salvation by faith was never salvation in what god did in the generation before or what god had done in the previous dispensation their salvation by faith always came by what god was presenting to them that day and he was giving them a word that would save them if they would believe it a word that would deliver them from bondage a word amen that would deliver them from destruction a word that would save them if they would believe that present truth praise be to god let's look at verse six but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him man let's turn over to romans chapter four romans chapter four in verse 19. we're referring to abraham here and he says and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead which he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead so if you believe on him not you believe that jesus raised from the dead but if you believe on him that raised up jesus from the dead and who is the hymn it's god and the hymn is the word it's god the word so you must believe him amen and he is the word amen and how do you contact him he is the word amen that's presented in your day and that's how you come in contact with god if you can't you can't come in contact with god amen through the word that was presented in another day that was the contact for god in that day but your contact for god to that day is the word amen because he is the word the word is an expression of god and we contact god through the word that he's expressing in the day that we're living and that's our contact point to god amen and so when we believe that when when abraham come in contact with god and god gave him a promise and god told him something it was specific to the day that abraham was living in he wasn't referring abraham back to something that happened before but he was giving abraham a promise and a word to be fulfilled in that day and he presented to he presented to abraham a present truth and abraham believed god he believed god amen he believed god despite the impossibility of the things happening in him but he was not weak in faith and he staggered not at the promise but being strong in faith and he wasn't an unbeliever but he was a believer and because he believed god amen it was imputed unto him for righteousness not because abraham was righteous but because abraham believed god it was imputed into him or counted unto him or put upon him that he was righteous and not to him only amen so now if i want the imputation of righteousness it's not just believing what abraham believed because what abraham believed was god what did abraham believe he believed him who raised jesus christ from the dead before jesus christ was raised from the dead who was it that noah believed noah believed him who raised jesus from the dead or was it that moses believed moses believed him who raised jesus from the dead and who are we to believe we're to believe him who raised jesus from the dead and whatever way he presents himself to us we're asked to believe him praise be to god now let's go to the gospel of john chapter 8. so just note that it wasn't written for abraham's sake alone that righteousness was imputed unto him but for us who would believe the same way abraham believed praise god john 8 21 then said jesus again unto them i go my way and you shall seek me and shall die in your sin whether i go you cannot come then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whether i go you cannot come and he said unto him ye are from beneath i am from above year of this world i am not of this world i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if you believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins now for us this is an easy statement but just think of who he's speaking to in that day he is speaking to the most religious of the most religious he's speaking to the pharisees and and the jews and the jewish religion and he's looking at them and he's saying unless you believe that i am he says i am he but he is an italicized in the in the king james an authorized version meaning that those who had translated the bible inserted it there for clear understanding but what it really says unless you believe that i am you'll die in your sins unless you believe that i am unless you believe god unless you believe me because i am the manifestation of god i that what were they what were you asked to believe in to believe in him who would raise jesus from the dead which is what god amen god was standing there in front of them being represented in a body of flesh he said lest you believe in this dispensation unless you believe in this manifestation unless you believe i am he you shall die in your sins and these are people who were reading the bible every day these were scholars and teachers in the bible these were those who had learned the law of moses and taken all the additional things that had been added to the law of moses by all the rabbis down through time and they had compiled all the laws amen and they were washing pots and washing hands and not moving on the sabbath they had the religion and the order of religion down pat because they did not want to be sinners so they in order not to be a sinner they did not want to transgress the law amen so everything was about the order and the form of worship everything was about the rules and not to break the rules and how can we reinterpret the rule so that we can still be in the rule and still do what we want to do and they thought by lining up to ordinances that they would have no sin but jesus said if you line up to all the ordinances and do not believe that i am he you will die in your sins so you have to understand this the the the his congregation who he's speaking to he's speaking to people amen when when paul began to explain that he was a pharisee of the pharisees zealous jew he says as touching the law i was blameless and these are the kind of people jesus are talking to that that they could debate with him on that law and they could debate him on that word and say we've kept that and we've kept this and we've kept that amen when the rich young ruler came to jesus and he's saying what must i do to inherit eternal life he says you know the law you know obey father and mother and don't don't do these things and he says all of these have i done from my youth all of these have i done for my youth the man had kept all the ordinances and he's talking to jesus and he's confident i've done i've done every ordinance every rule i've done everything but jesus it says jesus loving him beloved loveth him said one thing not lacquest you've kept all the ordinance you've been a good boy you've kept the religion but one thing not lackist sell all that you have and come and follow me sell out everything and come follow me give up all your desires give up all your plans give up all your hopes sell out and follow me the manifested word for the hour there's the same the same thing's going on this morning the same opportunity you have somebody who can be raised right and raise understanding what god wants and what god likes and what he doesn't like but keeping all of those you can keep all of that and die in your sins because what god is doing in this day what he's presenting in this day if it goes rejected it's the same as rejecting him who raised jesus from the dead because the word is in a manifestation today and that manifestation today is christ in bright form and he's asking us to believe that he is here that he is present that he's in a mini-membered body but jesus says unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins and the smoke was rolling out of the ears because they worked overtime to prove they had no sins amen praise god because righteousness is imputed by faith amen and expressed in faith brother branham said in the anointed ones at the end time he said how can they be separate when he said i and my father are one except you believe that i am he you shall perish in your sins see your unbelief sin is unbelief you'll perish in your unbelief they would die because they didn't receive present truth die in sin jesus or brother also says what shall i do with jesus called christ in 1963 but what if you walk out there with the blood on your hands and rejecting and know that he'll hell lays before you eternal destruction crying for the rocks and the mountains but prayed for prayers for the prayers were too late in hebrews 10 if we sin willfully sin is unbelief if we unbelieve willfully after we have received the truth the knowledge of the truth you don't have to receive it just know about it you don't have to have it oh no see didn't say after we received the truth he goes back to the scripture he says if we send willfully after we receive the knowledge that it is the truth there we made us no more sacrifice or sins but a fearful looking for the firing the nation shall devour the adversary because god said vengeance is mine and i will recompense saith the lord brother says if we believe if if we disbelieve it willfully after the truth has been presented to us there will be no more mercy no more mercy will be granted why the brother member said the devil will let you know all that's been done before is just fine and you can believe all of it you know satan was working brother jesus christ when he looked at the pharisees he says i am of my father and you're of your father the devil so where was satan working satan was working right in the church in the religious realm in the religious leaders they were children of satan and satan was working in their midst so jesus was having a standoff between god and satan in the church not in the world in the church was where the showdown was coming where the standoff was he said after we disbelieve willfully after the truth has been presented to us there will be no more mercy no more mercy will be granted now i went back to say he said now he'll let you believe all that was before and here were these religious leaders children of the devil working on behalf of the devil satan's children satan's instruments amen that he had totally taken over and they could believe what moses had wrote in a book and they could carry it around and they could read from it and they could and all of that they could say is true the parting of the red sea true amen the crossing of jordan true moses being a prophet true the pillar of fire coming on true it's all true it's all true and satan had no problem with them believing everything that was in the scrolls that they carried around except for the part of the scroll that pointed to the manifestation of jesus christ being in flesh and when it come to present truth amen he moved them to reject the part of the scroll that they were carrying around that was pointing to jesus christ coming in the flesh but everything else he didn't care if they believed it he didn't care if they preached it he didn't care if they made sunday school literature about it he didn't care how much religious teaching they had on the bible as long as they didn't teach that part and believe that part to pertain to their present day [Applause] praise be to god has anything changed friends nothing has changed we're in the same scenario right here this morning right here today it's okay did jesus christ come check yes did he die on calvary yes did he raise again the third day it's all true amen was was paul amen a messenger was paul a prophet and an apostle yes check amen was peter and did he have the keys check check check amen you can believe it all you can make literature to prove it all amen you can debate it with atheists amen satan doesn't mind he's in that program he's in the program amen of printing books he's in the program of printing sunday school literature i mean it's the same thing as when jesus christ was here nothing's changed friends we we've got to quit thinking differently than the bible but we've got to let the bible paint the picture accurately for us and he's looking at them and they've got programs and they've got schools and they're teaching in the synagogues and these little kids are learning and memorizing scripture from the time they're tiny taught and the devil doesn't mind that they memorize the books of the bible the devil doesn't mind that they're taught every day by rabbis amen to to believe all the miracles that had taken place they didn't mind that they knew the events in the exodus journey in chronological order but don't you dare t teach the types and shadows that are pointing to this day don't you dare show back through there where he was hiding and laying in between the lines what would happen when jesus was here don't you explain that don't you teach that you just teach what happened but don't you ever teach what's happening and jesus says though you taught it all though you believe it all though you can recite it all but because you do not believe that i am you will die in your sins carrying your scrolls around and memorizing the bible and knowing every exploit that moses ever did god didn't send a prophet in our day for nothing friends amen god didn't call out a bride for nothing amen this is what he's doing this is his present truth this is the most wonderful thing that is happening on the earth is the thing that's happening when god is being made manifest in flesh and what flesh in your flesh and in my flesh and that's his program and that's his present day truth that's what he cares about amen that's what he's watching for can you receive that can you believe that go back to this quote if we disbelieve it willfully after the truth has been presented to us there will be no more mercy no more mercy will be granted pastor listening to this tape what about it member of church listening to this tape what about him what are you going to do if we disbelieve it willfully can't wash it off your hands you can't pass it on to the headquarters it's going to backfire right back to you you have heard it what about you how are you going to stand in that day he's either on your hands or in your heart one or the other god help us brother ma'am says in uh a greater than solomon is here from 1962 the most horrible thing that there is friends is unbelief that's the only sin that there is the most horrible thing there is is unbelief can we get can we let that soak in and get to the place where we feel the same way the most horrible thing there is is unbelief the most the most detrimental thing to humanity is unbelief it is not poverty it is not sickness it is not war the most horrible thing is unbelief all of these things that we're taught are horrible amen and all the problems that we have to fix in the world will never be fixed by the measures they're using to fix them by amen because they're all based on unbelief and more measures of unbelief will never fix unbelief only cure is faith in god's word that's the only cure is faith in god's word and faith in present-day word that's the only cure he said that's the only sin that there is there is no other sin but unbelief i was preaching on that some years ago in a methodist church and it was a nice big methodist church and most of them are some of them believe in holiness and the the southern methodist and i was preaching about i said committing adultery is not a sin i said telling lies is not a sin taking the lord's name is not a sin that was just too much for some dear old sister sitting there her little collar got all up up around she said i pray you tell me what is sin that right she just couldn't hold it any longer i said sin is this my sister sin is unbelief they do those things they commit adultery they tell lies they do those things it's the attributes of unbelief so what we call sins are attributes of unbelief but the real sin is unbelief and because of unbelief these other things come out if they were believers they wouldn't do those things they're unbelievers that's the reason they do it it's just the attributes proving that they are unbelievers the scripture plainly teaches us that he that believeth not is condemned already see you can't even get started so the most horrible thing there is is unbelief let's turn to hebrews chapter 3 together i'd like to say this the most horrible thing we're facing in our day is unbelief not coronavirus not poverty not political unrest not uncertainty with china not economic downfall all of that is taken care of by faith every one of those things can be provided for by faith but the most terrible thing we're facing the most detrimental thing is unbelief so as believers as children of god we've got to be careful we don't get swept up into the move amen where people are moving in and this is terrible and this is terrible there's terrible things poverty is terrible famine is terrible war is terrible they are terrible things but let's come back to the realization of what the real core root cause of all the horrible things are and the real problem is unbelief it started with when eve disbelieved one word amen in unbelief continues to mitigate or continues to increase every problem that we're facing is based off unbelief amen and civilization in science and education is all of the devil and based on unbelief and satan's eden is as a civilization founded rooted based and propagated on unbelief so none of those things can help us you realize education science civilization can't help us the only thing that can help us is faith in god believing god wherever he is whenever he's presented in whatever form he comes whether it's print on paper or a brother standing in front of you believe god amen says verse let's look at verse 17 hebrews 3 and 17 but with whom was he greed 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcass fell in the wilderness and whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief verse chapter four verse one let us therefore fear lest the promise being left of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel priest as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in that in them that heard it so now oh what a key we have here in the scriptures these are the children of israel god's people it promised seed the the promise of abraham the descendants of abraham and of jacob amen they go down and get in bondage amen just like god said and he leads them out with a mighty hand he sends a mighty prophet and that mighty prophet has excuse me has the word he takes the word and he gives it to the people and by a pillar of fire and supernatural sign and a mighty hand he leads them out of egypt and he leads them along teaching them the word of god as they go and yet they perished in the wilderness because they couldn't believe they didn't doubt the parting of the red sea they didn't doubt the fire and the cloud coming down on sinai they didn't doubt moses being the prophet they didn't doubt god speaking to moses they didn't doubt the plagues they didn't doubt any of those things none of that was doubted they doubted the promise they doubted the word the present tense word that was given to them they rejected that word and when they rejected that word they died in the wilderness because of unbelief so you realize amen when when when the rich man dies and lazarus dies they go into the grave the lazarus goes into abraham's bosom and the rich man goes into hell and he lifts up his eyes amen from hell and he cries out and he asks god if he could just let lazarus dip his finger quench his tongue they have this dialogue jesus is talking about this and he says let him go back let lazarus go back and tell my brethren so that they will believe and he says though one raised from the dead they'll not believe though we part the red sea they'll not believe listen it's not that they didn't believe the parting of the red sea they believed the parting of the red sea they didn't believe all the word this is important friends this is really important because they walked along they could chronicle in their journal everybody walked through the red sea today it was amazing stood on the right hand in the left hand like a wall i mean i couldn't believe it i could see fish swimming behind in the water i mean you could you imagine we're dramatizing but could you imagine the stories that would tell they said did you see that big fish on the left-hand side when we walked through and did you feel how dry the ground was the water just moved it was dry not one of them doubted the parting of the red sea but that was not enough to get them to believe all the word because faith was going to meet a challenge amen and the only thing that was going to rise to the occasion rise to the challenge was a genuine faith in the heart the superficial faith that comes from seeing is not enough the superficial faith that comes from seeing is not enough that's why i love the testimonies of brother branham they're a vindication of his ministry and that he was called and what god had told him was vindicated and proven but the testimony books is not enough the the you we realized that we realize now that the testimonies aren't enough because when somebody begins to question the testimonies like how many people fell off a bridge and you know whether or not you know how how his brother died and whether or not this well i don't remember know them all you guys probably know him better than i did but when people begin to question and cast doubt on the miracles and cast doubt on some of the healing and some of the miracles and we can question you know the date that a cloud was there and what made a cloud and all of that you realize people's faith began to crumble because their faith was based on the part they could see and when you cast a doubt on the part that can be seen faith began to crumble and collapse and show that there was nothing there in the soul to believe with it was an intellectual faith based on hearing and based on seeing and we need a faith that's greater than a faith based off hearing and on seeing but we need a faith that goes all the way back to before the foundation of the world when the attribute of me was seated in god and the mind of god and that's the faith that will overcome in this day and it'll believe without seeing it'll believe when everything goes wrong it'll believe when your world gets turned upside down that's what had paul and silas singing in prison after they'd been arrested and they'd been beaten they met and they had stripes on their back and they were hanged and they were handcuffed to the wall and they were singing out why because that the obstacle the the detrimental position they were in didn't change the faith that was in their heart you see friends god's the one who's in control of all these circumstances but don't believe that faith will not be tested faith will be tested faith will be challenged because god knows that unbelief has to be rooted out and only faith will win the day this is the victory that overcome with the world even our faith and that's a gift of god residing in the attribute in the soul the seed gene of god the ability to believe so god in order to make sure only his children make it all the way through he flips everything upside down he does the opposite amen he he breaks everything apart to make sure only his believing children make it through because the promise is to those that endure to the end so he's going to make sure that the only way that we're going to endure to the end is that we have genuine faith in the word of god a faith that's god's own faith not even our own faith but god's own faith which has been planted in me [Music] so don't worry about things going wrong that's a good thing god's just shaving down the crowd god's just thinning out unbelief because what he wants is faith he wants faith he wants faith in his present tense word so it's amazing sometimes you go to do something by faith and everything goes completely wrong praise god i want to ask you a question what's changed if you feel led of god anointed by god and you see the word of god and you move forward by faith in god and faith in the word of god you see your position in the word you feel the anointing of god you feel the leadership of god and you move forward and all of a sudden the bottom falls out the walls fall on and you find yourself in absolute chaos and ruin i wouldn't get excited because nothing's changed nothing's changed we don't we don't it's not by sight but by faith we don't believe in what we see we believe in what he said and what he said will never change based off what we see amen when it looks worse many times it's getting better that's been all through the bible friends that's why when we read the bible's flannel graph sunday school stories we miss the whole point but when we believe it as real life events that happen to real people just like you and i all of a sudden it starts to come home and you say hey that's what i'm going through right now this is the sec exact same circumstances i'm in right now this thing that noah went through i'm right there this thing that moses went through and that that paul's going through i'm right in the same place that's a good place to be so now they let's look back at verse one chapter four verse one let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of him for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them so the gospel was preached unto them right this goes to show that the gospel is not just jesus died on a cross and was resurrected because the gospel was preached unto them and he says the gospel is preached unto us the same as it's preached unto them amen now you notice he didn't say the same gospel but he said the gospels preached unto us the same as it was preached unto them they received the gospel paul received the gospel and we've received the gospel and the names and the dates and things can change but it's the gospel which means the good news and the good news is what god is doing in your day that's the good news the good news the gospel is what god is doing today that's the good news remember he doesn't mind that you can believe that jesus died on a cross and then that you can print t-shirts amen and declaring that you believe jesus died on a cross he doesn't mind you believing that satan doesn't mind you believe that the whole church can believe that you can write books upon it and preach a series of sermons upon it and there's nothing wrong with it it's the word but he doesn't mind you believing that but he does not want you to believe that he is the smitten rock smitten again in this day when the word came and was rejected you believe that but don't believe this amen so so now the gospel was preached to them paul says is the same as it was gospels preached the same as it was to them what was their gospel their gospel was deliverance out of bondage out of egypt and taken to a promised land guess what that's the same gospel paul's preaching only he's not talking about a physical egypt and a physical land but he's talking about coming out of religion and going into christ now brother branham would come and he would preach the same thing paul preached because he's preaching the gospel and he's preaching about coming out of the denominational religion coming out of denominations and going into christ it's the gospel friends the gospel is the good news the good news is what god is doing in your day i mean that was good news and i'm happy for them in that day but i've got to have a gospel for my day i've got to have a good news today not what was good news previously but what's good news now friends what is the good news now where is god now where is the manifestation of the word today but see they received the gospel was preaching for unto us was the gospel preached verse 2 as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and then they heard it they had the gospel preached and they heard it but they missed one ingredient faith they had a prophet they had miracles they had deliverance they had manna that came from heaven they had a water that sprung out of a rock they had every provision they needed i should say it this way they had everything they needed to believe with except to see gene everything carnally could was provided to make a believer oh i love this we got 1200 tapes we got living testimonies we've got recorded testimonies we got picture books we've got churches all over the world we've got preaching going on on wednesdays and sundays and now preaching via remote you know skype and all these other things in zoom going all over we've got everything that we need to have a believer in this day but the only way to have a believer in this day is if somebody's got a receiver down on the inside to receive all of this that's here we've done a great job and there's no fault in doing a great job we should have put all our effort into spreading the message all of our effort into gathering the testimonies all of our effort into recording them we should do that that's a good thing but that's not enough all of that can only lay on the surface but there's got to be something down under the service that can reach up and connect to that there's got to be a faith amen they had the gospel preached they had the signs and wonders but it wasn't mixed with faith because there was no faith to mix it with where did they get it where did it come from caleb and joshua will walk the same path they come out of the same bondage they heard the same preaching they saw the same miracles they they experienced all the same experiences god they they they did everything that the unbeliever did joshua and caleb did all the good and the bad and the hunger and the thirst and the water and and the quail i mean they went through everything everybody else went through everything laid here the same but there was one difference that there was something inside caleb and joshua that could believe let's go let's go back let's just turn back real quickly to to uh numbers 14. i'll get a little bit out of sequence maybe but that's okay numbers 14. they come to cadis barnea the spies go over joshua and caleb are two of those spies they come back to ten given evil report now the ten they weren't necessarily lying they were saying there's giants there's walled cities there's a bunch of people and this is really a tough place and that may have been every word the truth but they weren't speaking truth it's amazing you can say every word true and lie or you can mess up all your words and get all the details wrong and say it wrong and still be telling the truth brother branham did it all the time so they they had the facts right they come with a sheet of facts and these facts would would hit the reasoning cardinal logical mind of a people logically a people who were slaves with no weapons with no training can't take a walled city where you can ride chariots around the walls you remember the venom describing this it doesn't matter how many of them are how are you going to take a walled city amen that you can ride chariots around you have no armament you have no weapons you have no training you've been slaves for 400 years you've been in egypt for 400 years you've been in bondage for a number of those years you come out you don't have any skill in fighting you don't have any weaponry how are you going to do this so they come and they listed the facts walt cities giants i mean of course yeah there's big fruit i mean it's wonderful it's wonderful it's land that flows with milk and honey here's the fruit of the land it's a wonderful place but but but oh my goodness when it comes to the word of god leave the butt out that's right it's a wonderful promise that's right it's a wonderful this that's right he's your healer but oh leave that out friends he comes to the they come back and they yes it's this and it's that but there's giants walled cities armies and then this is where they took truth and made it a lie but we're not able to take it but we can't take it that's where reasoning injected a lie because that wasn't the truth they were looking at their ability and said i can't take it and it was never based on their ability but always based on his promised word they come here in chapter 14 verse 1. it says in all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night because of what the ten spies had said and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in the wilderness look at what they're saying they were marching freedom coming from freedom to their own land and now they wish they had died in egypt or died in the wilderness and there wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return to egypt you know what we're looking at friends reasoning we're looking at a human mind based on reasoning and the solution to their problem was to make their own captain they had a captain it was the pillar of fire amen leading through moses and but they wanted to make their own captain and go back into egypt because now they thought they were going to die and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt now here's the part that amazes me i just i don't know why god wires his believers different we look at things differently if they said oh i wish i would have died in egypt or i wish i would have died in the wilderness my question is why don't you go and take the land and die there why not try you know why not be a real believer why not just say well uh oh it would have been better if i had died in egypt it would have been better so if you wish you was already dead give it a shot go for broke take him at his word jump forward into the battle and if they kill you you get your wish just be a believer quit this carnal hey what happens if you believe and you die praise god i'm in the sixth dimension i don't care but i'm going to take him at his word i'm not listening to your reasoning it doesn't matter to me what you think and all the facts that you have and all the oh how terrible it is and how likely it is we're gonna die amen i don't value my life on this earth anyways i'm here for his purpose not my purpose and i'm not going anywhere until his purpose for me is accomplished that's what the prophet of god said is it true or is it not true the scripture says the footsteps of a righteous are ordered to the lord he says we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works that he hath ordained we should walk in them so those things that he's listed for me to do as i'm ordained to do i will do [Music] if that means die believing his word then it was ordained for me to do it nothing's going to happen in the life of a believer unless it first crosses his desk and he signs off on it so when we come to obstacles that are impossible when we come to things that look you know certain destruction if it's in his word if his word said forward then go forward why because i mean you wish you were dead anyways i mean i it's a good thing i wasn't there that day because i would ask the question so what's the big deal what's the problem oh you know you know we wish we would have died hey if that's what you want follow me let's go to the promised land let's take him at his word see god he he wanted something different in this reasoning than this human i mean in all their reasoning and wisdom they're so unreasonable they're so ridiculous i wish i was dead then what are you worried about why did you bring us here that we might die you just said you wish you were dead and so in all the wisdom and man and reasoning of man he becomes an absolute fool and then the best idea he's got is let's make us a captain and let's go back into bondage where we came from and they have been crying to get out of there they've been crying when god came down and talked to moses in the burning bush he said i've heard the cries of my people and i've come down they were crying to get out of egypt now the best solution they got with human reasoning and science and education and all that man could come up with their best solution to the problem amen was let's make a captain and go back to egypt oh i say caleb had the best solution to the problem let's keep going forward friends that's the best solution amen he says now verse 4 and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt and moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly and the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephena which were of them of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defenses departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not what was he looking at they had walked through the same land they had saw the same cities they had witnessed the same giants but they saw something totally different the ten spies they walked through and saw a walled city and they say impenetrable they walked and they see giants amen and they said we can't defeat giants and caleb looks at giants and say if there's enough food to feed them big boys i can feed my family if this land will support giants it'll support my tribe see faith looks at the picture totally different than what unbelief amen that's the same picture they're looking at the same thing and seeing two totally different things there's a giant he'll kill me no he won't kill me god already promised give me this land but you know how much food he eats do you know how much food his children need do you know how big his garden probably is and it's already planted friends let's go kill him amen can you imagine how many tomato plants he put out this year free food we feed four families oh faith overcomes every obstacle faith sees the promise of god faith will conquer they will crest every wave so they're looking at something totally different verse 9 only rebellion you're not against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us they just said the other ten said we're grasshoppers in their sight they saw themselves as grasshoppers in their side but joshua and caleb saw them as bread they're bred for us their defenses departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before the children of israel so the most sensible thing that had been said yet was what joshua and caleb said but the response to that was let's stone them they're speaking the word they're speaking faith in the word they're actually believing that what god said is true they are actually believing that we should go up and take this land they actually believe them giants are bred for us and they actually believe their defenses are melted away they actually believe what they heard moses say god said so there's only one solution for us and that's to kill them why is it when jesus told the truth the only solution they had was to kill him why is it when paul told the truth the only solution they had was to kill him why because the devil doesn't want anybody to believe the gospel the present good news because it exposes all of his tactics of reasoning and science and education and civilization all crumble in the face of faith amen god is good i want to be a real believer and i would rather die trying to take hebron where the giants were than die trying to make a captain to go back to egypt i would rather lose my life on the word of god than to save my life by rejecting the word of god and trying to protect myself amen and make myself safe and secure and free from all harm but reject the word of god i say let me believe the word of god and it leaves me exposed and it leaves me exposed but i believe the word of god because egypt's not going to help me if i go back to egypt i go back to what i was in egypt a slave if i had died in the wilderness you know what it's like to die in the wilderness oh we died in egypt to redine in the wilderness that's like saying i wish i would have died back when the message was easy before i came to the final showdown when my faith was actually going to have to be put to the test i wish i would have died a seeming believer along the way than to have it really put the test to prove whether i am or not it's the truth anyhow it's the truth if it cuts me to the heart it's the truth anyhow i wish i had died in egypt i wish i had died along the way because now i wouldn't be exposed as an unbeliever when things begin to get tense when the word actually has to be on display and it has to put me in a position where i'm vulnerable when the word begins to put me in a position where my faith is going to be put to the test and vulnerability is going to come out and consequences for believing are going to come to the surface i could say i wish that i had a nice message funeral amen back 10 years ago when everything was fine and there was no pressure and i couldn't see things picking up in pace and getting more intense and more intense and more intense why couldn't have i just died and they buried me as a believer instead of standing here in this day at the showdown to where i was going to be proven what i really am [Music] it's the truth friends i said god make me a believer oh i just want to be like that man who come to jesus with the epileptic child and he says does thou believe he says i believe help thou my unbelief lord i'm a believer but give me more amen unlock more to me amen i need more amen what i have is not enough amen you've got to unlock more that's down there i don't want to be weak in the faith but i want to be strong in the faith i don't want any unbelief left in me wash it out oh god i believe helped out my unbelief amen i can't help it friends i believe god help me you believe we believe let's believe praise be to god i say it like this unbelief hides in unusual places unbelief hides in religion because jesus he could look at the pharisees and he says unless you believe i am he unless you believe i am you'll die in your sins and he was exposing that though they look good on the outside he says you're like a sepulcher white washed on the outside and inside you're full of dead men's bones and where was unbelief hiding it was hiding in religion and and listen the greatest unbelievers were the pharisees the sadducees the the the council amongst them were some of the greatest unbelievers in the promised word of god and all of judea and all of jerusalem was right there so unbelief hides in unusual places i'll put it like this because religion is a good place for unbelief to hide unbelief will climb to the highest heights in religion because if it's a good mask for unbelief satan is hiding behind the mask and he's going to climb to the highest heights of religion that's what jesus faced so unbelief hides in unusual places but if you read the bible you begin to see it it's all through there unbelief hides in human reasoning it's reasonable common sense says if it's so common is it truth is the truth ever common just a question if everybody thinks one way is that usually the way god thinks the whole world thinks this only a few of you weirdos think this common sense would say joshua and caleb didn't have the common sense of the day they had a sixth sense not common sense and i want sixth sense to overrule common sense praise god i like brother branham i'm not supporting ignorance i'm not saying i'm not saying be reckless for no reason i'm saying believe the word follow the pillar of fire stay with where god's leading and don't let reasoning stop you if god's leading don't let reasoning stop just be sure of god's leadership and be sure that it's leadership on the word amen but don't stop just because reasoning shows you a good reason to stop wait till god tells you to stop amen so it's not reckless abandonment to prove that i'm a real believer and i'm going to charge against everything that's foolishness that's that's not what god asked us to do but he asked us just to follow him to believe him and if he leads us then we're safe you know the safest place to be is smack dab in the will of god for your life and it doesn't matter what reasoning says amen the safest place for you as an individual to be is smack dab in the center of god's will and every nobody around you may understand why you're there or what you're doing and it may not make sense to any of them but it doesn't have to make sense to any of them it doesn't even have to make sense to you all it has to allah has to do is trigger from the sixth sense that this is what god wants me to do and then you hold fast to that and you see it in the word let god bring it to pass but don't move from it just because somebody can sit down and reason with you let the word move us friends brother man says in the message look it says when he came into the world he was the word himself he didn't have to write no books he never wrote a book he he was the word he didn't have to write about anything because he was what the others had wrote about he was the word therefore he didn't write anything with his own hand he was the word itself and he's the same yesterday today and forever so he still remains the word so if we want him we must get the word for our day and if we get the word for our day we're getting him so there's a war sometimes between reasoning and revelation in the word so let's take revelation in the word and discount reasoning so unbelief hides in reasoning which is science and logic right it's not logical to walk on water scientifically it's impossible it's not logical amen to take a piece of bread and break it and expect another piece to grow back that's not logical that's not reasonable yet it's true it's not logical to think that peter can go throw a line and a hook in the water and the first fish that he pulls out he can reach in and pull a coin out of its mouth that's enough money to pay for his tribute and jesus's tribute that's not reasonable friends i've fished a lot and i like fishing and i've never found a coin in a fish's mouth and i've got hundreds of fish and reasoning and science and logic would tell me that there's no coins in fish's mouth because i've tried it and i proved it i've broke bread i've ate slice after slice after slice you see reasoning in science and all these carnal things amen they can they they're there to be an antagonist to faith to try faith to test faith because for the sixth sense has to push through the muck and the mire of the pond so that the lily can come out and strike the sun it's got to go past reasoning past logic past science past education past common sense and get up here to where it could get in the sunlight and then bloom into full bloom got to be able to push its way out another place that unbelief can hide is in church said religion religion i would say is the form of religion i pray my prayers every day i listen to so many tapes i you know i i do all my religious duties amen that's the same thing the pharisees did and i doubt we've gotten as good as at it as they are but that form of religion was a place to hide unbelief unbelief was hiding in the camp of israel when they were then when they were walking in the word and following a pillar of fire and a prophetic ministry from bondage all the way to the promised land and unbelief was walking right in the midst of that fulfillment of the word wherever god's working satan's working unbelievers hiding in reasoning and science and logic amen because you can make a good case for anything you can make a good case for anything list your facts put it together sit down you can sell somebody on anything you just get all your facts lined up and they can all be true facts and reasoning and logic and science and you begin to demonstrate and show how it's always worked this way and this is the way it will always be and you can't go beyond these boundaries and blah blah blah blah blah and a lot of times all that is is a hiding place for unbelief what's really under all that is unbelief but unbelief is gathering the facts unbelief is looking at the science unbelief is looking at the logic in other places in church in the group in the group unbelief can hide in the group and because we know that this group is okay i'm okay that's dangerous the unbelief can hide right in the church amen it can hide in the group amen when when jehoshaphat went up to see ahab and they were going to take some of their land amen they had 400 brothers said hebrew prophets amen with a gift and manifestation in their life 400 of them that all said the same thing go up and take it it's in the word we have a scripture we also have a supernatural element among us that told us it's right go take it and for some reason jehoshaphat asked the question is there not one more and they have said there is but i hate him and brought mackay up and mekiah said something different than the rest of them and said because micaiah based off faith in a true gift was able to stand in opposition to 400 of his peers and said how can the 400 be wrong and the one be right read the bible that's all i got to say is read the bible amen it's not the group it's not the security in numbers amen you have to remember i i want to explain this for a minute there's two natures to a christian i'm two good natures i'm not talking about the bad there's the sheep nature and the eagle nature right the sheep nature it meant is in relationship to is in relation to your relationship with jesus christ and in your relationship to one another right just the human side like we will never not want to get together and have fellowship that's the sheep nature we will never stop wanting to be close together to fellowship and meet at each other's homes talk about the word and congregate together we're never going to stop wanting to do that that's the sheep nature and the sheep nature is what makes us timid incapable right totally dependent on the shepherd all right so in in relation to our natural life our natural part of our christianity we're sheep but down in the soul there's an eagle and the eagle can fly solo all by itself right the eagle can get its own fresh meat right when it can't go to church the eagle still eats if the church is closed the eagle still eats because the eagle can find its own fresh kill of the word it can fly high it can see it can hunt amen and you know what you can't help an eagle fly flying's not one of those things you can do in tandem it's not one of those things you can do with training wheels it's not really one of those things you work your way up to i mean you're not flying and now you're flying i mean there was no crawling and toddling and holding the hand and eventually walking that's not how flying works friends the way flying works is is you know you got wings and you find out they're there and you start to flap them and say what does this do but there comes a day that you jump and then you fly before that you weren't flying and now you're flying and nobody could hold your hand when you did it so there's two aspects to this christian wall there's a natural side of us amen that wants fellowship and should want fellowship that's dependent and needy and totally incapable of doing anything for themselves right but there's an attribute of god on the inside that's a little eaglet just like the father amen that can fly high and see it far off that can catch revelation independent of the group that can feed on the fresh kill independent of the group that can find its own rabbits you realize that's the ego nature and god is going to prove both he's proved the sheep side but he's proving the eagle side here lately and more and more i believe he'll be proving that these are his eaglets if you separate them put them all by themselves you put john on the isle of patmos he was an eagle amen you separate them and disband them and you send them from the fellowship in jerusalem they went out eagles were they sheep yes but they're eagles too amen praise be to god so that's why sometimes church is a place to hide because sometimes a goat can look like a sheep and act like a sheep and mix with the sheep but in the goat is no eagle so sometimes a place for unbelief to hide is right in the group walk right in the church see god he wants to have preeminence and he'll do whatever he wants to get that preeminence look at john let's go back to the gospel of john and look at john chapter 5. john chapter 5 and verse 45. jesus says do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even moses in whom you trust for had you believed moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words my what a stinging accusation he made and he says i'm not accusing you he said i'm not going to accuse you i'm not going to say anything that book you're holding under your arm is going to accuse you that scroll that you've been toning around and quoting out of that's the thing that's going to be accuse you because if you don't believe what he wrote there how can you believe in me because i am what he wrote there can we say that about ourselves i am what he's written here he said he'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle this is right here he's going to have a bride without spotter wrinkle he's got work to do friends but he's doing it by the washing of the water of his word there's a manifestation of the word on earth today and it is present tense truth [Music] brother man says in the message there is a man here that can turn on the light and to you man that's listening to this across the world wherever you may be there is something wrong with your experience when you say that you love god and refuse his word there's something you refuse to no wonder that things can't the church is in its condition and the things can't cannot be done as god promised is because you won't even receive the word or walk in the light the bible said let us walk in the light as he is in the light then the blood of jesus christ god's son cleanses us from all sin sin is unbelief how do i get cleansed from unbelief by walking in the light let's go to that in first john first john 1. first john 1 5. first john chapter 1 verse 5. this then is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him has no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin we've said this many times you all know this but i i'm going to stir up your memory it didn't say if you walk in the light as he was in the light not where light once shown but where light is presently shining where light is presently shining you must walk in that light and if we walk in that light as he is presently the gospel the good news today shining that light then we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin all unbelief all attributes of unbelief brother remember the feast of trumpets he said how will the messiah the people that's believing him now know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is daniel said the wise shall know but the foolish the unwise wouldn't know they shouldn't know their god now now he shall appear in the last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen oh just get the imagery we all know this this is nothing new but i just love it that she will know her husband her mate the revealed word so if you want to meet your husband and meet your mate you have to meet him as the revealed word [Music] right we're not we're not looking to embrace a physical body of flesh yet that'll come next but now we're embracing the body word of the son of man we're embracing the revealed word amen that is our husband that is our mate that is our counterpart we are the revealed word he is the revealed word and two revealed words are coming together we're embracing him word coming to word word embracing word light and light coming together life and life coming together so we're going to embrace him we're going to embrace him as the revealed word amen it wasn't in the reformers it wasn't in luther wesley and the pentecostals and them scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age we're living in the age that his coming will be in she must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband for the two or one and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two or one and he is the word not the denomination get what he's saying now be real careful here he's saying she has to be identified with her husband for the two or one so whatever he is she has to be she has to be identified with him standing alongside him identified with him his identity is her identity right and so he says now and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one and he is the word not the denomination he's showing people are embracing the denomination which is another husband he's not talking about a physical body he's talking about the word they're embracing their denomination in their denominational teaching that's not him we have to be identified with him what is him it's the word it's the word made light it's the word manifest in this day and we have to be identified with him which is not the denomination we can't be identified with the denomination wrong husband but we have to be identified with him our mate our husband which is the revealed word is it not the denomination the word we are to be children of the light and the light is the word which has made light for this age if you walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from all sin what's the light the light is the word which has made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh the word made flesh not the denomination where's the word reflection she must be identified in him she must be identified with him where is the word made flesh friends where and all the earth is the word made flesh you point me to it where in all of the world today is the word made flesh it's in his bride the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it and the bible said so if you walk in the light and see that's not being close to a bride member that's not being in a bright church amen it's none of those it's not by association but it's about you being born again in him amen and he in you amen it's the revealed word for the hour and the revealed word for the hour is christ in the formation of the bride [Music] and we can only get into that through new birth amen by revelation amen by the baptism of the holy ghost for that is the light for this day and if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from all sin where are we going to walk in the revealed word i just in the back just before i come out something just hit me and it was exciting and i just want to show right here where we're at titles of brother branham sermons i'm going to read some titles and i want to ask you where your husband's at i want to ask you where christ is it is i be not afraid what's he preaching about who is the eye brother branham there is a man here that can turn on the light is there that's the question is there is there a man here is the son of man here it wasn't brother branham the son of man was using brother branham amen to turn on that lie but the brother branham's off the scene son of man still here i'm asking you the question is there a man here that can turn on the light who is that man that is your mate your husband the one you're to be identified the one you're supposed to be embracing and if you walk in that light as he is in that light hallelujah then there's a washing amen then there's a separating from unbelief without that we're rejecting god to reject that is to reject god the question is is there a man here who can turn on the light oh yeah who is he my husband my mate the revealed word he's here to turn on the light who do you say this is what a question amen who do you say that is is it the man on the platform or is it the pillar of fire the angel of the lord christ himself descended to open the seals [Music] who do you say this is oh well you know it's you know it's not christ yet but it's kind of like i mean in a way you got the wrong person who do you say this is brother man's asking a question who do you say this is what reasoning will say well you know because of this timing of sequence and it doesn't come yet and then that's not the question don't give me your reasoning what does your heart say who do you say this is if it's not jesus christ i don't want anything to do with it if it's not him i don't want it if it's like him part him i don't want i want him wherever he is that's where i want to be look away to jesus where do you look where's brother branham pointing and look away to jesus where's he pointing them to he's pointing them to the word look away to jesus the revealed word he starts describing the events that are taking place the manifestation of the word in that day look away to jesus where do i look to him he's right here the identified christ of all ages where is he being identified amongst his people mighty god unveiled before us he didn't say the mighty god which will be unveiled before us when we get there the mighty god which will be unveiled for us later he said the mighty god unveiled before us present tense truth see brother branham knew what he was talking about he knew what he meant by what he said and if you just read i had the best time in the back i took 10 minutes i could probably find a lot more but like who is this melchizedek [Applause] logically you would say who was that if he's answering the question of who melchizedek was in the bible brother brennan would title that who was that melchizedek that's how everybody else refers to it but brother bannon realizes that the white wig one has come down that the high priest has descended and he's come with an open book in his hand and so now he asks the question the correct way amen he's not that he's unschooled in grammar it's not that he made a mistake he asked the question exactly the right way who is this melchizedek which melchizedek the one that's present which one's the present the same man that can turn on the light the same identified christ of all ages the same one you're supposed to be looking away to amen the same one that says i'm here be not afraid hallelujah friend i don't know about you but i'm happy i'm happy to be alive i'm happy whatever trouble has to come just don't take this away from me don't take this message don't take this revealed word away from me don't pluck this out of my heart this is my promised land and i'm walking in it and i don't care how many giants are there all it's proving is it's a good land a real good land if they got enough material out of that land to build a walled city that you can march a chariot around then that means this is a good land amen they've got resources coming out their ears they've got abilities that i've never seen before this is a good land i'm not afraid of this land they're bred for us friends every demon that's sitting on the word he's got to get out of the way because this is my land amen praise be to god who do you say this is that's the question of the night who do you say this is is it kind of like jesus may be in a way and or is it him as he come in the invisible union tonight unite with you don't worry about what you see don't use reasoning and logic and physical i see this and that brother bam said we don't look for nail prints we look for the word made manifest to find our mate to find our husband don't let that logical reasoning tie us down that carnal i have to see this and it's physically here it's physically there that's materialistic friends that's carnal understanding but something in our heart says he's here i'm embracing him i'm uniting with him the real living breathing jesus christ that has shown me he's the mighty god unveiled the identified christ of all ages the man who can turn on the light he's here i can feel him i know i'm embracing him he's embracing me he's whispering love secrets in my ear it's him amen it's not a creed it's not a dogma it's not a set of teachings it's him and if it's not that i'm finished count me out i wasn't looking for another denomination i wasn't looking for another group of people to associate myself with amen if it's not that check me out i'll tell you something else if i can't have the faith of caleb amen if i can't have the case of faith of caleb i said god take me off this earth today because i don't want to live another day in unbelief i don't want to have another day gazing over to a promised land not believing that i can have it in my life i want the faith of caleb god or take me off and if this message isn't the same today as it was when brother branham preached it get me out of here i check out i'm done if it doesn't have the same power to deliver me it doesn't have the same power to bring me out if it doesn't have the same power to reveal christ to me count me out amen i don't want to i don't want to have a faith and the man that was standing there it wasn't him the same one that was standing next to him is standing here today if it's some kind of different or inferior faith or an inferior word i mean check me out send me somewhere else i don't want none of it but it's got to be the same power the same manifestation the same word with the same power to back it up or i don't want any of it praise be to god don't want to act like an unbeliever in the face of trouble i want to be a believer i want to believe this word this word is my protection this word is my deliverer this word is my strong tower this word is everything to me praise be to god nothing's changed friends we went through a hard trial people got really sick and they were really sick really bad off well what's changed in the word what scripture has changed what part of the message is different what power of god is still not made manifest nothing's changed i believe the same way i believed before i believe the same things i believed before god allows things to teach us lessons god allows things to display himself god does what he wants to do he's still god and i still believe him the same way i believed him before it all started praise be to god i don't want to die in egypt i don't want to die in the wilderness i want to die with a sword in my hand taking back my land if i'm going to die i want to die taking hebron where the more the giants are i want to die man taking a walled city i don't want to die along the way so that somebody can bury me put on my tombstone he was a great pastor he believed the message no i want him to know that i believe the message not because i died in a time of peace with no challenge to faith but if there's going to come a challenge to faith i say god i believe helped out my unbelief i believe lord unlock more i believe give me more shine the light brighter i need a greater portion and i know i realize i need a greater portion amen it's in there but i need it to come out amen i need more of the carnal unbelief of the world washed away from my mind and moved away from my psyche so that what's there can come to the surface in a greater way we believe the word because he he called us to be believers in this day he called us to manifest his word he called us to stand upon his word and ask what i want to do with everything that's in me i if you find me dead with a sword in my hand rest assure that whatever killed me got stabbed at least once rest assured i went down swinging amen you can rest your you can rest suddenly on the fact if you say oh what happened to chad it was so sad hey man he got this and that happened and this you can rest assured there'll be blood on my sword because i want to die a believer if i if i give if it's his predestinated plan for me not to go in the translation then i want to die believing his word [Music] i don't want to take the safe route i don't want a captain to go back to egypt i don't want to always keep my hands clean and keep my reputation pretty great but i want to be a believer and believe this word all of my days let's go to john chapter 3. musicians you can come the gospel of john chapter 3. we've got a lot more but we're going to hold it off for sunday i just feel to stop here john chapter 3 verse 16. for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life remember now walk in the light as he's in the light so what does it mean to believe in him amen for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil why will somebody stay in the darkness of denomination this is what the scripture says when they see the light when they see the truth when they see the gospel the good news today but they'll stay in a denominational darkness you have to ask yourself why why didn't those 10 spies want to take the land good question why did joshua and caleb want to take the land but why did the ten spies refuse the promise refuse the word refuse the whole purpose of their journey the red sea parted so that they could take the land i mean the cloud came down the manner fell the water came out of the rock so that they could take the land everything that had been done was leading up to them taking the land and now they're going to throw it all away why did they not want to take the land scripture i think tells us in numbers chapter 14 caleb and joshua they steal the people and they says listen if the lord delight in us if the lord that's the question are you confident in his love for you that's the real question the real question is who are you caleb and joshua was no big deal they said they're bread for us if if the if the lord delight not he'll deliver in the more hand they'll be bred for joshua us caleb what did they see they saw themselves as loved of god they saw themselves as recipients of the promise they saw themselves that promise was them that promise it was a personal promise to joshua and caleb to the rest of them it was just a promise you see the difference yeah it's the promised word but joshua and caleb it was the promised word to them and they had confidence in god's love for them and god's election and god's choosing and god's providence to bring them all the way there had only secured the fact that they knew god loved them and if god delighted us there's nothing going to harm us and so the the question the statement by caleb amen proves what is in the heart of the ten the ten didn't know whether god loved them or not they didn't really know who they were they weren't secure in their relationship and their position with jehovah they had fallen they knew moses was good they had fallen most they knew that was a good connection and they had enough faith to follow that although they questioned it a lot but they could see things that proved that you know moses was in tight with god but when the showdown came when it was them with a sword in their hand when it was them with their wives and their little ones having to stand on the word they didn't know if god would show up on their behalf or not they didn't know if god really loved now they couldn't doubt that god could do it because they saw him stand the water up they saw him feeding man from heaven every every single night they saw him bring quails amen they saw him do all the things they could not doubt god's ability to deliver them but they doubted god's love for them and that's the reason they refused the word and refused the promise and wanted a captain to take him back to egypt and wish they had died because when it came down to the showdown the question was not with god the question was with them they didn't know if they really were the children of god i'm telling you we're all going to face the same thing we are everyone going to face the exact same thing and the question is is he my father or is he just father to people around me is he a father to the bride and the believer or is he my personal father who looks after me and will keep his word and promise to me that he will deliver me that he promised to me that by his stripes i am healed is he my father and are the promises mine or am i part of the religious church movement and says yes we are part of the promise yes he is our father there's coming a day that's not going to work anymore we felt really secure saying he's our father he's our deliverer he keeps the word he'll deliver his bride he'll raise his bride up he'll translate his bride and you can get everybody in a room to shout amen when you say that but now the question is is he going to raise his bride the question is does he delight in you does he delight in you did he make the promise to you is the promise for the translation yours or is the promise for the translation general to the bride we've tried to be bribed by association and you can only be bribed by relationship [Music] not by association but by personal relationship he has been revealed personally to you there's been a quickening of the seed in your soul when christ himself has come to spark off and quicken that seed in the soul and there's been a invisible union between you and christ and then you have to be confident he delights in you it's not good enough he delights in the ministers and he delights and my mom and dad and i can see oh they've got miracles there and this brother has this and all around my church there's testimonies friends there's coming a day that won't hold water that won't mean anything for you the question is does he delight in you that's the question to be answered right now friends that's the question does he delight in me when i'm all by myself when there's not a spouse or a child around when there's not a minister or the congregation when i'm all alone does he delight in me and if you can answer yes to that question then there's nothing going to hurt you then there's nothing to worry about there's nothing to be afraid of because he's got it all in control my father he's my father you realize friends he's my father i'm not even saying our father he's my father and my father won't let anything happen to me that's not part of his purpose and plan and if my father in his wisdom saw fit to let this trial come then my love to him is to say thank you jesus i love you anyhow and i worship you anyways if the lord delight in us we can take the land if the lord delight in us everything's but bread for us if the lord delight in us their defenses is melted away if the lord delight in us you know what the response was take up stones to stone them why they did not want to be exposed as unbelievers and when somebody else believed the word it showed them off as unbelievers and they wanted to take up stones and stone you know what they should have said i believe god helped down my unbelief they should have said you're right joshua caleb you're right i got caught up in the carnal thinking i got caught up in fear i got caught up in all the news i got caught up in all this you're right pray with me brother we all get caught up in news we all get pushed into the corner we all let down on the promise is there anybody here who's never let down on the promise please stand i want to meet with you afterwards is there anybody who's not failed by reasoning not failed by fear we all have but we're coming to a place where faith is going to be the victory and god's training us by the ups and the downs and the good and the bad and the successes and the failures and he's teaching us to stay with the word stay with the word stay with the word stay with the word and realize that my father has become my husband and i'm in a deep dark trial but the relationship i have with him i realize that there's a man here that can turn on the light not in the church building not in the pew next to me but there's a man here who can turn on the light and if there's a man here who can turn on the light then don't worry about the deep dark trial he's got it all under control let's all stand praise be to god can we sing he's got it all in control my father knows what i need let's sing this song together knows [Music] my father knows what i need everything i go through he knows what's best for me my father knows what i need he's got it all in control he's got it he's got it all in control he put that reassurance way down in my soul he's got it all in control i put my life in his [Laughter] [Music] head every road i walk down i'm sure he'll see me through i put my life in his hands [Music] oh my father knows [Music] my father knows what i need in everything i go through he knows what's best for me my father knows what i need praise the lord let's pray lord jesus we thank you father we thank you god that we realize there's a man here that can turn on the lights god not far away not waiting to come but there's a man here that can turn on the lights now you're a very present help in the time of trouble that you're a friend that sticketh closer than a brother that you are a present tense god here on the scene now open the eyes of our heart lord that we can see open us lord our understanding that we can realize that you're here lord awaken us to the reality all around us god if we could see but for a moment the spiritual warfare the angels in camp all the things that are going on around us lord we would never fear again but god give us that spiritual insight to know that nothing's out of kilter you're in control and everything's on time i love you father and i thank you god for your mercies thank you for your grace and thank you for your love god i pray if there's any here lord who's struggling god i pray you quicken that seed of faith on the inside by your very personal presence that you would make contact with them and spark that seed to life lord and for all of us lord every one of us we want to raise our hands and say lord i believe helped out my unbelief i believe but brush away the carnal dirt that's in my mind brush away the humanistic understanding that i've been brought up in move it away from me lord burn it out of me by your spirit lord and let me believe your word in a greater way let my confidence be in you and lord if there's any questioning whether or not you delight in them i pray god that you would whisper in their heart right now that they are the apple of your eye lord that they are the prize that you've been looking for lord that they that you delight in them i pray you make it real and personal to each one give us faith to believe lord give us the faith of all the saints lord give us the ability lord to believe in a greater way unlock lord the reservoir of faith that is in our heart and let it be on display i pray bless your people lord as we go from here anoint this lord in this world we live in lord with the uncertainty and not knowing what will happen next

by your spirit lord i pray you put a special anointing upon kyle as he's preaching right at this time lord i pray god that you would just move the man out of the way and help him to relax and that you would take that gift by your spirit and use it to minister to the needs that are there lord god i pray that we get a report lord that that it all went well by your grace we love you lord we commit ourselves into your hand and ask that you would take us by your grace and use us for your glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you all we have some with us who's not been yet so god
