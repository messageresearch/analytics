TRANSCRIPT
========================================
maybe I'm saying I'm seeing so much wrong in the churches and I feel like I got to correct it all by myself and straighten it up and there's things in there and all of a sudden he realized what's that to thee follow thou me amen if a thousand go off what's that to you if ten thousand Fall Away what does that matter what about that Brethren what about that brother why can he do this and why can she do that what is that to you follow me what does that matter are you willing to be nailed to the cross are you willing now you've seen it all you've endured it all amen you've you've gone through all kinds of the things that you can go through in the church you've failed yourself you've seen others fail you you've seen all of this strife and contention let's go back to the beginning now I'm still the same Jesus Christ this is still the same message this word has the same power it has the same provision it has the same life but they forget about they but I forget about I let's go back to the beginning I've called you I've called you for a reason I've called you for a purpose you're part of my kingdom I haven't a plan I'm going to use you but you're going to have to be willing to be sacrificed you're going to have to be willing to give your life to follow me and it doesn't matter what happens to anybody else we get so discouraged because did you hear what's happening in this church did you hear what's happening in this family did you see this did you hear that did you hear the decision they made and Leadership did this and I think we should have done this amen and we get so discouraged by those things and all of that what does that matter follow the Lord amen he called us are we happy to be in the message are we happy with the word are we happy that Christ is resurrected and alive he meets the same provision he's the same Christ it's the same message with the same power and the word is being revealed people will make mistakes all around us all the time that's not going to go away it's always been wherever the church was it's always been that way it's going to continue to be that way so what amen why does that why do we let that hinder us follow him amen can we go back to our first love and say Lord I'm discouraged I've been discouraged I've been hurt I've been wounded I've been troubled I failed but oh I want to serve you with the same Vigor with the same life with the same joy that I did from the beginning
