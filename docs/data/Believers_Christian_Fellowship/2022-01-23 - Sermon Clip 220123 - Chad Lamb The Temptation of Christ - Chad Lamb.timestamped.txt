[0:00] let's just bring this down home amen how
[0:03] many times oh my goodness how many times
[0:06] are we tempted to do something that's a
[0:08] little deviation from the word and from
[0:10] the plan of god but it's not something
[0:12] that's completely wrong
[0:14] amen what you know what about what about
[0:18] uh
[0:18] i don't know even i don't what about
[0:21] taking a job amen and taking that job
[0:23] moves you away from fellowship or takes
[0:25] you away amen from church or takes your
[0:27] family away and you say but you know
[0:29] i've got to support my family and it
[0:31] looks like god gives this to me but you
[0:33] know the word says don't forsake the
[0:35] assembling together of yourselves you
[0:37] know that that is the word and it
[0:38] doesn't mean that you never never have
[0:40] to work a job never miss a service i'm
[0:42] not talking about that but i'm just
[0:43] talking about a principle brother ben
[0:44] brought this out and i thought it was so
[0:46] good the principle of it not the law but
[0:48] the principle
[0:50] you can take in a relationship you know
[0:51] this relationship is forbidden by god
[0:53] the prophet speaks against it amen but
[0:55] what you can do is then you can start
[0:57] praying about it
[1:02] and don't think the devil can't give you
[1:04] supernatural experiences to tell you
[1:05] that that's okay
[1:08] don't you think that circumstances won't
[1:10] start lining up or you'll have a dream
[1:12] as a confirmation or somebody will call
[1:14] you up and say you know i was thinking
[1:15] about so-and-so or all right have you
[1:17] ever thought of employment over here
[1:19] don't you think that the devil cannot
[1:21] work in the supernatural and you think
[1:24] it's god giving you the permission to go
[1:26] against his scriptures
[1:29] because it was supernatural but because
[1:31] it was supernatural is no right to go
[1:34] against the word of god
[1:37] so we can look at jesus's temptation but
[1:39] what about our temptations
[1:41] what about the things that come to us
[1:43] what about when we know good and well
[1:45] the prophet taught this the word of god
[1:47] is against it the scripture says but you
[1:49] know what i'm going to go to
[1:52] prayer why if you go to prayer you
[1:55] better be praying that god gets that
[1:57] desire out of your heart so your desire
[1:59] matches his word don't go to prayer to
[2:01] ask god for permission to do something
[2:03] his word forbids
[2:08] listen i mean this works in all kinds of
[2:11] circumstances
[2:13] i mean
[2:14] i i mean if you want to leave one job to
[2:16] go to another but god hasn't given you
[2:18] permission to leave that job it's not
[2:19] wrong to leave a job to go to another
[2:21] that's not sin
[2:23] but we want to be led by the spirit we
[2:25] want to be led of god we want to ask god
[2:27] god do you want me to leave this job and
[2:28] go to this other
[2:31] and you can pray about that until you
[2:33] get supernatural signs
[2:38] and what is it
[2:39] really
[2:40] you'll pray until something matches your
[2:42] own desire
[2:46] that's why brother branham said you have
[2:47] to first get neutral
[2:50] when you go to pray
