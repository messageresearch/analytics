========================================

do you remember the time brother branham was preaching and danny henry came up to him at the end of service and wrapped his arms around him and gave him a prophecy over him in french and it was translated in that prophecy it says because you've chosen the harder way the narrow path and you've done this of your own choosing listen god had already foreordained it he saw it before the foundation of the world do you think that prophet do you think he was going to go any other way god had already ordained it so god already saw it but god was still so pleased when he saw a man who could choose any way he want he would choose the harder way he would choose by his own choosing no force no coercion god not pushing him into it but he himself would say i'll take the narrow away i'll take the harder way it's so pleased god amen that when that man wrapped his arms around him he began to speak in perfect french and god had a human interpreter there and he had a woman who spoke prince there and another interpreter there amen and they all gave the interpretation and it all matched god was so pleased with a man amen what was he doing he was walking in the vision god had already ordained it he was doing what god told him to do but god wasn't going to shove him in a tube and pull him out the other end and said you chose no he had his own choice to make as a man as an individual representative of a human being with the seed of god on the inside he had choice and when he chose what was in god's mind god was delighted with his choice are we the bride of jesus christ i believe with all my heart i am as he saw me cross the finish line absolutely am i going to be perfected by the washing of the water this word i know it but he's still watching for my choice and i want to please him with my choice i want to make the joy i want to go the narrow way i want to take the harder choice i want to sacrifice myself i want to surrender all i want to make the choice that will cause him to say you've chosen of your own choice in the precise and correct way and it is my way oh there's nothing that would make me happier than to hear him say that about me you chose you chose of your own choosing i didn't make you i didn't force you but you wanted to i said god i know there's going to be a bride in this end time that's going to choose his way she won't take her away it's already been prophesied it's already been spoken it's already in god's mind it's already set and it's sealed there will be a bride who won't fall white if the way he felt she won't fall by her own carnal lust and her own will but she's gonna do so of her own choosing [Music] because she wants to
