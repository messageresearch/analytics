[5:02] good to be with you this evening
[5:04] and while we're standing let's take our
[5:05] bibles and turn to genesis chapter three
[5:08] thank you musicians man it's so good to
[5:11] gather every time we get together it's a
[5:13] privilege amen
[5:16] may he be the central theme of our
[5:18] gathering
[5:19] genesis chapter 3 we're going to read
[5:21] the same portion we're going to start
[5:22] with the same portion we've been reading
[5:24] we're back to uh the series we've been
[5:26] on religion versus relationship
[5:28] part four and the subtitle for this one
[5:31] is separation
[5:32] so we want to look at this today genesis
[5:35] chapter three and let's begin at verse
[5:37] six
[5:38] and when when the woman saw that the
[5:41] tree was good for food
[5:42] that it was pleasant to the eyes and the
[5:44] tree to be desired to make one wise
[5:47] she took her the fruit thereof and did
[5:48] eat and gave also into her husband with
[5:50] her and he did eat
[5:52] and the eyes of them both were open and
[5:53] they knew that they were naked and they
[5:55] sewed fig leaves together
[5:57] and made themselves aprons and they
[5:59] heard the voice of the lord god walking
[6:01] in the garden in the cool of the day
[6:03] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[6:06] from the presence of the lord god
[6:08] amongst the trees of the garden the lord
[6:10] god called unto adam and said unto him
[6:12] where art thou
[6:13] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[6:16] garden
[6:17] and i was afraid because i was naked and
[6:19] i hid
[6:20] myself let's bow our heads and ask the
[6:22] lord's blessing
[6:25] lord jesus we thank you father that you
[6:27] by your grace have brought us here again
[6:30] you've given us strength and health and
[6:32] freedom and liberty and the ability to
[6:34] gather together
[6:36] then we might worship you lord god we
[6:39] just come now to
[6:40] the part of the service where we're
[6:42] asking you lord to break the bread of
[6:44] life
[6:46] to feed your sheep lord would you break
[6:48] it with your own hand
[6:49] nor would you would you make your
[6:50] presence known among us lord
[6:53] and god we come to you lord because we
[6:55] need you lord we ask that you would come
[6:57] and do what no man can do
[6:59] that you would feed your sheep lord
[7:01] we're coming with expectation in our
[7:03] hearts we come with a desire to commune
[7:05] with you
[7:06] and lord we receive from you now in the
[7:08] name of jesus christ
[7:10] amen you can all be seated
[7:14] and this it's it's been uh
[7:17] just about a week since we've read this
[7:19] portion and whenever you read it it's
[7:21] just so
[7:22] amazing that the serpent begins to speak
[7:25] to the woman and the
[7:27] and the woman uh
[7:30] she knows the word she knows
[7:34] i would say she knows the commandment
[7:37] but she doesn't she doesn't quite have
[7:40] the revelation
[7:41] of the word and so because she just
[7:43] knows the commandment but she doesn't
[7:45] quite have the revelation of the word
[7:47] the serpent begins to question her amen
[7:50] and begins to adjust the word and
[7:53] without any true revelation on the word
[7:56] but just the commandment
[7:58] the devil's adjustment and flexing of
[8:01] the word
[8:02] is very very reasonable to her
[8:05] and that's why you know it's so
[8:07] dangerous
[8:08] amen just to be i say it this way it's
[8:12] so
[8:12] dangerous just to be a a
[8:15] message believer as far as just being
[8:18] part of a message church
[8:20] if i could say it that way just to be
[8:23] part of a message church
[8:25] but not have your own individual
[8:27] revelation from god himself
[8:29] it becomes very dangerous because the
[8:31] devil can come along
[8:32] and take what is true because what eve
[8:35] had was true
[8:38] but without the right revelation he
[8:40] begins to manipulate that truth and
[8:42] bring reasoning and mixed reasoning in
[8:44] with the truth
[8:44] and she's she's susceptible to that and
[8:47] she falls by that
[8:49] amen and then and then they find
[8:50] themselves adam and his wife find
[8:52] themselves fallen in a fallen condition
[8:55] and in this fallen condition they tried
[8:57] to cover their nakedness
[8:58] or cover their sin or their shame by
[9:01] reasoning once again
[9:02] and now they make themselves an apron of
[9:05] fig leaves sewed together
[9:06] so they might cover their sin and then
[9:09] covering their sin
[9:11] they're somehow justified in their own
[9:14] eyes
[9:15] if we could just say it that way in
[9:17] their own eyes you know
[9:19] the fact that they continue to wear the
[9:21] apron is
[9:22] evidence that they feel justified in
[9:24] wearing the apron
[9:27] if it didn't work amen in their own eyes
[9:30] and their own reasoning when they put
[9:32] the apron on they're like ah that don't
[9:33] work and they throw it to the side
[9:34] but the fact that they put it on left it
[9:36] on somehow in their reasoning and the
[9:39] carnality of their humanness
[9:41] amen they felt like it was okay it
[9:43] worked amen
[9:44] until amen the presence of the lord came
[9:48] into the garden and he made his presence
[9:51] known
[9:51] by his voice and under that
[9:55] voice they hid from the presence of god
[9:58] because now amen they were naked but
[10:01] they still had on the apron of fig
[10:03] leaves
[10:03] which shows that man-made religion will
[10:06] never
[10:07] work in the presence of god and when the
[10:10] voice of god
[10:11] amen comes in the garden the voice of
[10:14] god
[10:14] amen is is declaring the presence of god
[10:18] and adam and his wife were hiding from
[10:21] that presence
[10:22] because in that presence their fig
[10:24] leaves were dissolved
[10:29] and so this passage of scripture is is
[10:32] so
[10:33] sad but it so
[10:36] sets the stage for the next six thousand
[10:39] years of humanity
[10:42] you know brother said everything begins
[10:44] in genesis he was so
[10:46] absolutely correct far more so than i
[10:48] had ever imagined before
[10:50] and probably still more so than i even
[10:52] realized today
[10:54] have we seen enough that we can say
[10:56] that's probably every bit the truth amen
[10:58] we still probably don't even realize how
[11:00] correct those statements were
[11:02] amen we're just scratching the surface
[11:04] and god is just peeling it back
[11:06] layer by layer and every time he does we
[11:08] realize that that prophet knew exactly
[11:10] what he was talking about
[11:12] you know so many times the prophet of
[11:14] god he's teaching the bible
[11:16] he's teaching the bible with somebody
[11:18] who who knows the author of the bible
[11:22] but not somebody who's been educated
[11:29] and educated and knowing the bible
[11:32] intellectually he preaches as somebody
[11:35] who knows the one who wrote the bible
[11:39] like the man told brother venom he said
[11:40] you know you just don't know your bible
[11:42] very well
[11:42] and brother branham put up no protest
[11:46] he did not protest he said that may be
[11:48] true he said but i know the author
[11:50] really well
[11:51] and when he knew the author really well
[11:53] he knew the intent
[11:54] the meaning the purpose he knew what
[11:56] that word was for
[11:58] amen and when brother branham's
[11:59] preaching he's preaching bible
[12:01] principles
[12:04] because he knows the author amen he
[12:07] knows what this bible was written
[12:09] for he knows the purpose of the word
[12:12] what the word is trying to accomplish
[12:14] and now so many people have tried to
[12:16] debate with the message
[12:17] by taking a scripture and a definition
[12:20] and this and piecing this together and
[12:22] and oh my i tell you what they they
[12:25] they're trying to fight against the very
[12:28] revelation of why we have a bible
[12:32] trying to find technical flaws and
[12:34] technicalities in which the prophet
[12:36] may have may have uh used a scripture
[12:39] amen and quoted it in in
[12:41] incorrectly did he ever quote scripture
[12:43] correctly yeah he said he did
[12:46] he misplaced some of the bible
[12:48] characters
[12:50] different stories he got some of the
[12:51] numbers wrong
[12:54] but he knew the author real well
[12:58] and he may have got the wrong number of
[13:00] people or he may got the sequence of
[13:02] events out of order
[13:03] or he may have the wrong bible character
[13:05] performing the wrong thing
[13:06] amen but he was never an error to the
[13:09] truth of the word
[13:12] he was never an error amen to the mind
[13:16] of god
[13:16] on the bible to the intent that god had
[13:19] in giving us a word
[13:20] amen so now and just in the in the last
[13:23] so many years for me it's been 20 some
[13:25] years of coming to the message
[13:26] it meant so many things brother branham
[13:28] says because he doesn't always
[13:30] qualify all of his statements
[13:34] he's preaching principles he doesn't
[13:36] always go to the bible verse and say
[13:38] where i actually got that from these two
[13:40] verses and when you take these two
[13:41] verses and put them together
[13:43] with a phrase that i just said comes
[13:45] from those two truths
[13:48] and you try to find the bible that
[13:50] matches the statement
[13:53] and you try to find the bible verse that
[13:55] matches the statement and all of a
[13:57] sudden
[13:58] you can't find where did he get that and
[14:00] when you just keep reading
[14:02] and you just keep reading and you just
[14:03] keep reading and all of a sudden that's
[14:05] where he got that
[14:06] and that's where he got that amen i
[14:08] didn't realize it was laying in genesis
[14:10] and in revelation then in the book of
[14:12] john and
[14:16] you know what what's happened for me
[14:18] amen the message is taking away
[14:20] a traditional denominational
[14:22] understanding and it's still stripping
[14:23] it away from me
[14:26] i thought when i come to the message i i
[14:28] left the denominations behind
[14:30] but the truth is i did i walked away
[14:33] from the
[14:34] denomination but the effect of being
[14:36] taught that way all my life
[14:37] lingered and the and
[14:41] the message is still removing the
[14:43] lingering effects
[14:49] and you find that he knew what he was
[14:51] talking about
[14:53] he was he was right what he preached was
[14:56] the truth what he preached
[14:58] was the word and then he caught the
[15:00] spirit of it he caught the revelation of
[15:02] it
[15:02] and he preached that and you may be able
[15:06] to out quote bible verses head to head
[15:09] with brother branham
[15:12] but you can you can repeat the verse
[15:15] accurately and be wrong to the truth
[15:19] that that represents
[15:22] or you can quote the scripture
[15:23] inaccurately and be
[15:25] dead on the truth
[15:31] that's what we've been given this day
[15:33] the mind of the author
[15:37] and so we we thank god that all the way
[15:39] back in genesis
[15:40] we see all the way back here in chapter
[15:43] three we see the problem that we're
[15:44] going to be dealing with
[15:46] for the rest of humanity and the reason
[15:48] that god had to send the prophet in the
[15:50] end time
[15:51] was because of what entered into man
[15:54] through his reasoning
[15:55] right here in genesis chapter 3 that man
[15:59] decided that he was going to make
[16:01] himself his own covering
[16:02] to cover his sin and that's where
[16:06] religion began that's where the idea of
[16:08] religion has begun
[16:09] it began right here at the time of the
[16:11] fall amen and that is going to be the
[16:14] problem that is going to plague and try
[16:16] to and hold back
[16:17] god's elect seed all the way through the
[16:20] bible this is the thing that they're
[16:21] going to be fighting with
[16:24] and this is the reason that god at the
[16:26] end time had to bring a prophet to
[16:28] expose all of this
[16:30] so that we could go free
[16:33] he says there's a couple quotes that
[16:35] i've been quoting all along i'm going to
[16:36] just get
[16:36] caught up to speed here he says in the
[16:39] beginning when man sinned it showed the
[16:40] nature of man he's always trying to hide
[16:42] from god
[16:43] and make himself a way that he can feel
[16:45] justified
[16:46] a religion feel justified
[16:50] not be justified
[16:53] feel justified
[16:56] that's been a religion means a covering
[16:58] so he tried to make his own religion
[17:00] in the message satan's eden he says
[17:02] god's eden was established
[17:04] in righteousness satan's eden is
[17:06] established in
[17:07] sin because satan is sin god is
[17:10] righteousness and god's kingdom was
[17:12] established in righteousness and peace
[17:14] and life and sains satan's established
[17:17] is
[17:18] in sin and religious sin
[17:22] so i want you to catch that that god
[17:25] established his eden and righteousness
[17:29] and satan has established his eden in
[17:32] sin religious sin
[17:36] so this eden that we live in the satan's
[17:38] eating is established
[17:39] upon religious unbelief
[17:44] that sounds like an oxymoron but it's
[17:46] absolutely the truth
[17:48] it is this this world that we live in
[17:50] this satan's eating this culture
[17:51] everything around us that we're
[17:53] surrounded with is religious
[17:55] unbelief disbelieving the word of god
[17:59] rejecting the truth of the bible but
[18:01] being religious to make a covering to
[18:03] cover
[18:04] all of that sin so that they can feel
[18:06] justified and still be an
[18:08] unbeliever in the word of god
[18:13] and that's what satan's eating has
[18:14] established upon religious sin
[18:18] and the god of this evil age he says
[18:20] notice cain he didn't want no blood
[18:22] sacrifice
[18:23] he come down and offered the fruit of
[18:24] the fields of beauty upon his altar very
[18:26] religious
[18:27] done everything that just exactly like
[18:29] abel done offered a sacrifice fell down
[18:31] before god in worship
[18:33] obedient in every way but without the
[18:35] revelation
[18:36] of the word and the word was from the
[18:40] beginning god's plan but god revealed by
[18:42] revelation the very thing that he
[18:44] vindicated and punctuated
[18:46] that that was right not religion not an
[18:49] altar
[18:50] not belonging to church not making a
[18:52] sacrifice not being sincere
[18:54] but by the revelation of the word of god
[18:57] so everything comes back to revelation
[19:00] of the word of god
[19:01] that's what god wanted that's how god
[19:03] wanted to reveal himself to his people
[19:05] that's how god wanted to lead his
[19:06] children by revelation of the word
[19:11] let's go to hebrews chapter 11.
[19:16] read a portion here and then we'll go
[19:18] back
[19:19] to genesis hebrews chapter 11
[19:28] and verse 4.
[19:32] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[19:35] excellent sacrifice than cain by which
[19:37] he obtained witness that he was
[19:38] righteous
[19:40] okay by faith abel
[19:44] offered unto god a more excellent
[19:45] sacrifice
[19:47] abel didn't figure anything out
[19:50] it was revealed to him by faith abel
[19:54] offered him to god a more excellent
[19:55] sacrifice than cain
[19:57] by which he obtained witness that he was
[20:00] righteous
[20:02] so his ability to offer the right
[20:06] offering by faith
[20:07] witnessed that he was righteous it
[20:10] didn't make him righteous
[20:13] it witnessed that he was righteous
[20:18] god testifying of his gifts now see this
[20:20] is so important
[20:21] i just want to come back and nail this
[20:23] down amen
[20:24] abel by faith offered him more extra
[20:27] sacrifice not by tradition
[20:28] not by intellect not by reasoning not by
[20:32] figuring he
[20:32] by faith he offered a more excellent
[20:34] sacrifice than that of cain
[20:36] amen by which he witnessed it witnessed
[20:39] that he was righteous all right
[20:41] and so now when we see that you could
[20:44] get into a mode where you say oh
[20:46] amen if you offer the right sacrifice
[20:49] you're righteous
[20:50] and now you can get into repeating what
[20:52] abel did
[20:53] and believing that you're righteous
[20:55] because you can do what abel can do
[20:57] but you're not righteous because you do
[20:59] what abel does
[21:00] you're righteous because you believe the
[21:02] way abel believes
[21:06] because his action witnessed that he was
[21:08] righteous
[21:09] his action didn't make him righteous so
[21:12] repeating his action won't make you
[21:14] righteous do you understand
[21:19] this is the problem with religion amen
[21:21] it becomes monkey see monkey do
[21:23] and all of a sudden god oh they're godly
[21:25] i'll do what they do and i'll be what
[21:27] they
[21:27] are but you can't just copy somebody and
[21:30] be what they are
[21:32] they are what they are by the election
[21:35] of god
[21:35] there's a faith that's unlocked in them
[21:37] and that by faith amen
[21:39] they believe god and it is imputed unto
[21:42] them for righteousness
[21:44] so this gave witness that he was
[21:47] righteous
[21:48] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[21:51] being dead yet speaketh
[21:53] by faith enoch was translated that he
[21:55] should not see death and was not found
[21:57] because god had translated him for
[21:59] before his translation he had this
[22:01] testimony
[22:02] that he pleased god but without
[22:05] faith it is impossible to please him so
[22:08] how did
[22:09] enoch please god by his works no
[22:12] by his faith
[22:15] because without faith it's impossible to
[22:16] please him and he had this testimony
[22:18] that he pleased god so it means enoch
[22:20] had faith
[22:23] see when we try to please
[22:27] god or get in good graces with god
[22:31] by good conduct
[22:34] it doesn't mean we should have bad
[22:35] conduct to get in good graces with god
[22:39] so the if i if i make a statement it
[22:41] doesn't automatically mean the opposite
[22:42] truth
[22:43] right so it's not like i'm going to get
[22:45] no we want to do right we want to serve
[22:47] god we want to please him but you cannot
[22:49] please him by works you can only please
[22:51] him by faith
[22:52] amen in that faith that will move you
[22:55] into an action
[22:56] and the action will testify that you're
[22:58] righteous
[23:00] but you can't just adapt the action
[23:03] without the faith and be righteous
[23:06] you cannot please god just by doing
[23:10] all the things that the people who
[23:12] please god do
[23:16] it's got to be faith it's got to be a
[23:19] gift of faith that god gives
[23:22] you have to believe
[23:26] but without faith verse 6 again it is
[23:28] impossible
[23:30] to please him for he that cometh to god
[23:32] must believe that he is and that he is a
[23:34] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[23:36] him
[23:37] by faith noah being warned of god of
[23:39] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[23:41] prepared an ark
[23:42] to the saving of his house by the which
[23:44] he condemned the world and became heir
[23:47] of the righteousness which is by faith
[23:50] by faith abraham when he was called to
[23:53] go out into a place which he should
[23:55] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[23:57] and he went
[23:58] out not knowing whether he went by faith
[24:01] he so adjourned in the land of promises
[24:03] in a strange country dwelling in
[24:05] tabernacles
[24:06] with isaac and jacob the heirs with him
[24:08] of the same promise
[24:09] for he looked for a city which hath
[24:11] foundations
[24:12] whose builder and maker is god
[24:16] he was looking for something he was
[24:18] looking for the city of god the
[24:20] habitation of god
[24:21] he was looking for that new jerusalem
[24:26] let's go all the way back to genesis now
[24:30] genesis chapter 6. let's read through
[24:33] here a little bit
[24:36] i just want to keep going
[24:39] in the direction we're going right here
[24:40] through the book of genesis for a little
[24:42] while
[24:43] genesis chapter 6.
[24:47] and we'll read verse 1 and it came to
[24:49] pass when men began to multiply on the
[24:51] face of the earth
[24:52] and daughters were born unto them that
[24:53] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[24:56] that they were fair and they took them
[24:57] wives of all
[24:59] which they chose so now we know that
[25:03] god becomes displeased with this he says
[25:06] in verse 3 and the lord said my spirit
[25:08] shall not always strive with man for
[25:09] that
[25:10] he also is flesh yet his day shall be a
[25:12] hundred and twenty years
[25:14] so so god sees that now
[25:18] his elect seed the sons of god are now
[25:21] taking unto them looking at the
[25:22] daughters of men and recognizing their
[25:24] fair and taking into their wives
[25:26] and god did not like this mixing at to
[25:29] this time god had never
[25:31] interrupted cain's line and what cain
[25:33] was doing
[25:34] he didn't stop him from his scientific
[25:36] achievement and didn't stop him from his
[25:37] manufacturing
[25:38] he didn't stop him from a city building
[25:40] he didn't stop any of that
[25:42] until amen that influence started to
[25:45] influence the sons of god and when that
[25:47] influence began to influence the son of
[25:49] god
[25:50] bringing a mixing amen god come down and
[25:52] he cut the thing off and he preserved
[25:57] noah and noah's three sons and their
[26:00] wives
[26:02] and he brings them through the ark and
[26:04] he brings them out on the other side of
[26:05] the ark in chapter nine
[26:08] in chapter 9 verse 1 he said and god
[26:10] blessed noah and his sons and said unto
[26:13] them
[26:14] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[26:17] the earth
[26:18] so he sends them out he says be fruitful
[26:21] and multiply and replenish the earth
[26:24] and he sends them away from the ark amen
[26:26] to go
[26:27] amen and to spread out and to replenish
[26:30] this earth
[26:31] then he goes to verse 7 and he repeats
[26:33] it he says and you
[26:34] be fruitful and multiply bring forth
[26:38] abundantly in the earth and multiply
[26:41] therein
[26:42] so god's desire was that they would go
[26:44] from the ark that they would move
[26:46] out and that they would replenish that
[26:48] they would multiply abundantly upon the
[26:50] earth and replenish the earth
[26:52] but you see man has always got a better
[26:55] way than god's way
[26:57] and we go to verse our chapter 11
[26:59] genesis chapter 11
[27:03] verse 1 says and the whole earth was of
[27:07] one language
[27:09] and of one speech and it came to pass as
[27:12] they journeyed from the east that they
[27:13] found a plane in the land of shinar
[27:16] and they dwelt there and they said one
[27:18] to another go to let us make brick and
[27:20] burn them thoroughly
[27:21] and they had brick for stone and slime
[27:23] had they for mortar
[27:24] and they said go too let us build us a
[27:26] city and a tower
[27:29] remember we said this is the first
[27:31] unifying of church and state city
[27:34] represents
[27:35] uh your civil authority your
[27:37] civilization
[27:38] and the tower represents your religion
[27:40] and so here we have the first
[27:41] unification of church and state
[27:44] and then we find this takes place again
[27:45] in revelation chapter 11
[27:47] but it starts in genesis because
[27:48] everything starts in genesis
[27:52] and they say go to let us build us a
[27:54] city and a tower
[27:56] whose top may reach into heaven and let
[27:59] us make us a name
[28:00] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[28:03] face
[28:03] of the whole earth so now under nimrod
[28:07] because brother ben tells us this is
[28:08] under nimrod's rule
[28:10] under nimrod he begins to become a
[28:12] mighty one upon the earth he becomes the
[28:14] mighty king amen he establishes his
[28:17] kingdom
[28:18] and now it's not just one location with
[28:20] a head of the family and a tribe but now
[28:22] there's a king who's going forth and
[28:24] conquering and he's bringing
[28:26] subjects under his dominion and he's
[28:28] establishing multiple cities if you read
[28:30] of nimrod back in chapter 10 you see
[28:33] that he's establishing a kingdom
[28:35] through all of mesopotamia amen and this
[28:37] is the first time that we see this in
[28:39] the bible
[28:40] and what he's doing is they're bringing
[28:41] them together now and they want to be
[28:44] unified sounds good to be unified let's
[28:48] be one
[28:48] amen it depends on how you're one
[28:50] whether being one is good or bad
[28:54] now let's be unified amen let's build us
[28:57] a city and a tower
[28:59] amen let's bring this civil and
[29:01] ecclesiastical unification together
[29:04] amen so that we won't be scattered
[29:06] abroad on the face of the earth amen
[29:08] and let's build us this tower unto the
[29:11] heaven so they've got an achievement
[29:13] that they want to achieve
[29:14] there's something that they're trying to
[29:16] do they're banding together a religion
[29:19] and they're tying it together with
[29:20] physical force
[29:23] this becomes forced religion
[29:27] because they have an army and they have
[29:29] people and they have cities
[29:30] and a kingdom and he said lest we be
[29:34] scattered abroad we're going to make a
[29:35] name for ourselves
[29:38] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[29:39] face of the whole earth
[29:41] and brother brahma says in the message
[29:42] oneness he said a false union brought
[29:44] judgment on the earth
[29:46] to eve and adam and eden and a false
[29:48] union brought the floods of god's
[29:50] judgment on the earth because the
[29:51] daughters of cain
[29:52] flirted with the sons of god and they
[29:54] fell for it and united together again
[29:57] there you are false union nothing could
[29:59] happen what did
[30:01] what did god do he destroyed the whole
[30:03] thing all but
[30:04] precious old noah and his family they
[30:07] got together
[30:08] and again after that after the death of
[30:10] noah and that spiritual family of noah
[30:12] first thing you know
[30:13] the children of man began to look to one
[30:15] another again
[30:16] what did they do now we're not infidels
[30:19] we all believe in god
[30:21] catch this they all believe in god
[30:26] and i just want to tell you that is one
[30:28] of the most deceptive statements that
[30:31] can be used today
[30:32] i believe in god amen cain believed in
[30:35] god
[30:36] satan believes in god lucifer believed
[30:38] in god
[30:39] everybody believes in god amen but
[30:42] but they believed in god nimrod believed
[30:45] in god
[30:46] but nimrod did not believe god
[30:50] nimrod believed in god but he did not
[30:52] believe god
[30:54] amen abraham believed god amen man he
[30:57] believed in god too but it wasn't just
[30:59] believing in god
[31:00] amen they both believed in god cain and
[31:03] abel believed
[31:04] in god amen abraham and nimrod believed
[31:07] in god
[31:10] judas and peter believed in god
[31:18] but he did not believe god
[31:22] abel believed god abraham believed god
[31:27] and there's a big difference and you
[31:29] have to ask yourself what part of god
[31:31] did they believe
[31:32] they believed the part that was being
[31:34] expressed in their day
[31:37] that's believing god everybody else who
[31:40] believed in the part that was expressed
[31:41] in a previous day
[31:42] believes in god
[31:47] so i believe in a previous dispensation
[31:50] nimrod believed the story of the fall in
[31:52] the garden
[31:54] nimrod believed a man noah and his
[31:57] family was saved in the flood
[32:01] but nimrod did not believe amen that
[32:05] god wanted them to scatter abroad and
[32:07] repopulate the earth that that was the
[32:08] will of god
[32:09] and he also did not believe that god
[32:11] would keep his word and not destroy the
[32:13] earth with the flood again
[32:14] amen he he believed amen that
[32:17] god had preserved noah he believed that
[32:20] there was an ark
[32:21] he believed that eight individuals come
[32:23] through that ark but he did not believe
[32:25] god because god said i will not destroy
[32:28] the earth again
[32:29] and i will put a token in the sky amen
[32:32] and to show my covenant with man and the
[32:34] earth i will never destroy the earth
[32:36] again
[32:36] but he goes about to unify the force of
[32:39] the people
[32:40] and gather the collective force and
[32:42] power of the people so that they can
[32:44] build their
[32:45] own religion and their own protective
[32:47] mechanism
[32:48] to protect themselves in the failure of
[32:51] god
[32:54] because the only way that they would
[32:55] need that tower to escape the flood
[32:58] is if god didn't keep his word
[33:02] and it proved that nimrod believed in
[33:04] god but he did not believe
[33:08] god
[33:12] i'd venture to say everyone who was
[33:14] gathered in that city and around that
[33:16] tower
[33:16] believed in god and believed in
[33:20] all the stories of adam
[33:24] and eve and the flood and noah
[33:27] they were all descendants of noah and
[33:29] his three sons
[33:32] they're all they all believe it
[33:39] but when god brings the word for this
[33:41] day
[33:43] go forth multiply replenish bring forth
[33:46] abundantly
[33:47] upon the earth they said let's not be
[33:50] scattered abroad
[33:54] and when god said i made a covenant with
[33:57] you with
[33:58] everything that breathes upon the earth
[33:59] and the covenant with the earth and the
[34:00] sign this token
[34:02] the sign of the rainbow in the sky is my
[34:04] token that i will not destroy the earth
[34:06] again
[34:07] nimrod did not believe that god would
[34:09] keep his word
[34:13] so nimrod was a believing unbeliever and
[34:20] he had religious sin
[34:21] religious unbelief
[34:26] and i would i would like to just bring
[34:29] to your attention
[34:30] that in the religious unbelief
[34:34] the works that they were willing to do
[34:37] the effort that they put into it the
[34:40] beauty
[34:40] the grandeur the sacrifice the
[34:43] commitment
[34:44] the sincerity and the dedication
[34:49] far outshined what abraham did
[34:55] just if you just take it in a cardinal
[34:58] just looking at
[34:59] how much effort labor work expense
[35:02] material use number of people involved
[35:06] sincerity and dedication amen what
[35:09] nimrod was doing in producing the people
[35:11] amen with their effort and their
[35:13] sincerity and their beauty and the
[35:15] religious order
[35:16] and their structure and their finance
[35:19] and everything
[35:20] was far outshining what abraham was able
[35:22] to do
[35:23] because all abraham was able to do was
[35:25] believe god and move forward
[35:28] believe god and move forward believe god
[35:30] and move forward but god declared
[35:32] abraham righteous
[35:33] and nimrod and all of them that built
[35:35] the tower were not righteous
[35:39] so it's not believing in god it's
[35:42] believing god
[35:48] he says
[35:53] after the death of noah we're back in
[35:56] the message oneness again that spiritual
[35:57] family i know first thing you know
[35:59] the children of a man begin to look to
[36:01] one another again what did they do
[36:03] they said now we're not infidels we all
[36:05] believe in god so they got a fellow by a
[36:07] leader some great archbishop by the name
[36:09] of nimram
[36:10] and they built a tower they wasn't
[36:12] infidels they believed there was a
[36:14] heaven
[36:14] they believed there was a hell they
[36:16] believed in judgments but the children
[36:18] of god were the daughters of man again
[36:20] and they made themselves a union falsely
[36:22] and built a great big cathedral and a
[36:24] great big
[36:25] organization and all the other places
[36:27] was to babel was to pay tribute to it
[36:30] and god hated that thing
[36:33] [Music]
[36:36] he hated that thing let's look at
[36:39] chapter 11 verse 5 now and the lord came
[36:42] down to see the city and the tower
[36:44] which the children of men builded and
[36:46] the lord said behold the people is one
[36:48] and they have all one language and this
[36:50] they begin to do
[36:52] and now nothing will be restrained from
[36:54] them which they have imagined to do
[36:58] so too let us go down and there confound
[37:01] their language that they may not
[37:02] understand one another's speech
[37:04] and so the lord scattered them abroad
[37:06] from thence upon the face of all the
[37:08] earth
[37:09] and they left off building the city
[37:12] therefore the name of it is called babel
[37:14] because the lord did there confound the
[37:16] language of all the earth
[37:18] and from thence did the lord scatter
[37:20] them abroad upon the face of
[37:22] all the earth so the very works that
[37:25] they were trying to do to protect
[37:27] themselves from being scattered abroad
[37:29] god come down in a judgment and condemn
[37:32] that thing and he confused their
[37:34] languages
[37:35] and scattered them he scattered them
[37:37] abroad upon the face of the earth
[37:39] showing that what god wanted god wanted
[37:42] the people to be scattered not unified
[37:46] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[37:48] god he still
[37:50] doesn't want this false union he still
[37:52] doesn't want
[37:53] man to unify himself god still does not
[37:57] want man to unify himself
[38:00] he doesn't want us to make unions he
[38:02] doesn't want us to
[38:03] the the unionize ourselves to gather
[38:06] ourselves together by our own means and
[38:08] by our own understanding and by our own
[38:09] efforts
[38:10] that's not god's kind of oneness that's
[38:12] not the oneness he's looking for
[38:16] that'll bring another false union but
[38:17] god doesn't want that kind of oneness
[38:20] he doesn't want that kind of unity does
[38:22] god want unity yes
[38:23] but he wants a unity of faith
[38:27] not not even necessarily does he need a
[38:30] unity of action he needs a unity of
[38:32] faith
[38:36] and a unity of faith is true unity
[38:43] you don't have to be in the same
[38:44] location
[38:47] you don't have to know one another see
[38:49] god
[38:50] wanted them scattered abroad he
[38:52] scattered them abroad
[38:53] because he wanted to be a father to them
[38:55] amen and he wanted them to do as seth
[38:57] and his children
[38:58] when they were scattered abroad and when
[39:00] they would seek the name of the lord
[39:02] they were calling upon the name of the
[39:03] lord
[39:03] and he could begin to deal with them as
[39:05] individuals because god was not going to
[39:07] deal
[39:08] amen in the group he wanted to deal with
[39:09] the individual
[39:13] in this false unity amen
[39:16] this false unity protected
[39:20] i hope you catch this this false unity
[39:24] protected the individual from god
[39:27] speaking to him
[39:28] directly
[39:32] this is the devil's attempt that
[39:35] now you did not need an individual
[39:38] interaction with god anymore what did
[39:41] you needed you needed a priesthood and
[39:42] you need a high priest you need a mighty
[39:44] king you need an anointed man and you
[39:46] needed a gifted this
[39:47] and you needed to establish that
[39:50] and then the individual would no longer
[39:52] be calling on the name of the lord
[39:54] they would be part of the religious
[39:56] order of the day
[39:57] and as part of the religious order it
[39:59] would become a covering
[40:01] that they would feel justified like
[40:03] everything's all right
[40:04] and they would allow god to speak to the
[40:08] head
[40:10] the head would come and tell all the
[40:11] subjects and what
[40:13] what this whole religion was trying to
[40:15] do was to create a
[40:16] barrier from individual revelation a
[40:19] barrier from individual communing with
[40:21] god
[40:22] a barrier to an individual seeking god
[40:25] alone
[40:27] and that is still the objective of
[40:29] religion today
[40:34] that's why some people they'll say they
[40:37] believe the message
[40:38] they're in the message and they never
[40:39] touch a tape never touch a book
[40:41] amen because they're sitting under the
[40:43] anointed man who reads the messages who
[40:45] comes and preaches and i just get it
[40:47] from my pastor
[40:48] amen it's the same system friends
[40:51] but the message came to abolish that
[40:53] thinking to demolish it to break it down
[40:56] and scatter us abroad away from the
[40:58] denomination
[40:59] so that we would each go back to calling
[41:01] on the name of the lord
[41:03] and said if god sent me the word i need
[41:06] to eat the word amen
[41:07] this is my bread i got from god himself
[41:10] amen i'm going to eat what my father has
[41:12] given me
[41:14] man i'm not going to ask somebody else
[41:17] to take their portion
[41:19] and cook me a peace
[41:22] but but now god has scattered us out of
[41:25] the denominations
[41:29] not so that we could bind ourselves back
[41:31] together under religion
[41:34] and that there would be a new barrier to
[41:38] individual communion with god
[41:41] that wasn't the point of the message the
[41:42] point of the message was to break the
[41:44] tower
[41:45] the point of the message was to destroy
[41:48] amen the roman
[41:49] system of worship amen which started the
[41:51] catholic church
[41:52] which started every other protestant
[41:54] church that came out
[41:55] of the mother turned back and became the
[41:58] same thing a prostitute
[41:59] off the mother and he came to
[42:02] break that walled city
[42:03] to break that tower
[42:08] not so that we would just go out
[42:11] to bind ourselves back together and to
[42:14] build the system over again
[42:20] praise god the word of god exposes
[42:26] everything how was it that nimrod was
[42:30] able to get so many people unified
[42:36] how how was he able to get so many
[42:38] people
[42:39] unified under such effort and and such
[42:42] sacrifice and such
[42:44] labor and all of this and i'll tell you
[42:47] it's because
[42:48] the fallen nature of man desperately
[42:52] desperately desperately wants a covering
[42:57] he does not want to face god alone
[43:04] the fallen nature of man does not want
[43:07] to stand before that holy fire
[43:10] does not want to come to the judgment of
[43:13] the revealed word
[43:14] he wants to hide behind another religion
[43:17] and he'll
[43:17] he'll put in great amounts of money
[43:21] extreme amounts of effort he will
[43:24] actually allow a ministry or a church or
[43:28] an organization
[43:29] to punish him spiritually
[43:33] have you seen it just so they don't have
[43:36] to face god alone as an individual
[43:43] it all started in genesis
[43:48] and god scattered them abroad
[43:51] upon the face of the earth because
[43:53] that's what he wanted so he could deal
[43:55] with the individuals
[43:58] and when he scattered them there was
[43:59] really one individual he was looking for
[44:03] and that one individual was caught up in
[44:05] that thing
[44:06] and that one individual was abraham
[44:09] he broke that whole system so that he
[44:12] could get abraham
[44:13] separated to himself because abraham was
[44:16] his elect seed
[44:19] and the prophet of god has come down
[44:20] this day and broke that whole
[44:22] system of nimrod again because he wants
[44:25] to get one
[44:26] all by himself and that one is the seed
[44:28] of abraham
[44:30] and if you're seed of abraham you're
[44:31] that one that that prophet came and god
[44:34] himself came down through that prophet
[44:36] and broke that system again
[44:38] so he could get to you you're the one
[44:41] that he wants
[44:42] amen brother says in jehovah jair he
[44:45] says now god called abraham
[44:46] not because he was abraham god called
[44:49] abraham by election
[44:50] abraham was no was no good man no better
[44:53] than anybody else
[44:54] this is doing me a world of good
[44:57] he probably come out of the group of
[44:59] idolaters down from the tower of babel
[45:01] where they worship roots in the ground
[45:03] and they had a woman up there and she
[45:04] had all kinds of curious arts she
[45:06] practiced
[45:07] if you ever read the history and there's
[45:09] where the first organized church ever
[45:10] began was in babylon
[45:12] by nimrod organized all the cities and
[45:14] they paid tribute and so forth to the
[45:16] one place
[45:17] now abraham's father brought him down
[45:19] from babylon
[45:20] and they dwelt in the city of ur in the
[45:23] land of chaldea
[45:24] and abraham was just an ordinary man
[45:26] like you and i
[45:28] just an ordinary man but god oh i want
[45:30] you to get it
[45:31] god by foreknowledge called him and
[45:33] elected abraham
[45:34] he knew his heart he knew him before the
[45:36] foundation of the world
[45:37] and abraham only fit into god's program
[45:42] again in jehovah jireh he says notice
[45:47] uh abraham was no different from no one
[45:49] else he was just an ordinary man
[45:52] he come down with his father after the
[45:54] scattering of babylon
[45:57] catch this he come down with his father
[46:01] after the scattering of babylon come
[46:03] down in the valley of shinar
[46:04] dwelt in the city of ur in the land of
[46:06] chaldea just an ordinary man
[46:09] and an old man why god called him he was
[46:11] 75 years old
[46:13] then he says in 1964 in the message
[46:16] jehovah jireh
[46:17] he says now abraham we find out don't
[46:20] appear until we find him here about the
[46:22] 12th chapter the 11th chapter of genesis
[46:24] we find that his father come down from
[46:26] babylon
[46:27] and abraham was just an ordinary man
[46:29] just as you or i
[46:31] or anyone else i just want you to see
[46:35] that the prophet is showing us that
[46:38] abraham's father was
[46:39] tied up in this system
[46:44] and when that system broke up terror his
[46:46] father
[46:47] brought him down he may have been a
[46:49] young boy i don't know how old he was
[46:51] amen but brought him down into ur and
[46:53] they were in er the child bees and
[46:55] and gone amen begin to call abraham
[46:57] begin to deal with abraham
[46:58] but you see that god broke this whole
[47:01] system up
[47:02] to free his elect from that so that he
[47:04] could get directly to his elect
[47:08] and god has broke the roman system of
[47:11] denominations
[47:12] so that he can get direct to the seed of
[47:15] abraham in this day
[47:19] but oh wouldn't satan love to build
[47:22] another system
[47:28] let's go to genesis chapter 12.
[47:35] genesis 12 and i'll begin at verse 1.
[47:40] now the lord had said unto abram get
[47:42] thee out of thy country and from my
[47:44] kindred and from thy father's house
[47:46] and to a land that i will show thee so
[47:50] he said
[47:50] the lord had said unto him speaking past
[47:52] tense because if you read the verse
[47:54] before
[47:55] in verse 32 of chapter 11 he says in the
[47:58] days of terror
[47:59] were 205 years and tara died in heron so
[48:02] tara at the breaking up of babylon tara
[48:06] his dad had brought him down to irv the
[48:07] childish and they lived there
[48:09] and god brother bam tells us god called
[48:11] abraham and er
[48:12] amen and tara wants to take his family
[48:16] to canaan so on the way to canaan they
[48:19] move up through mesopotamia to the north
[48:21] of mesopotamia
[48:22] and when they get to the top they stop
[48:24] at heron and at heron
[48:26] is where terror dies and when terror
[48:28] dies the next scripture says
[48:30] now the lord had said unto abraham to
[48:33] abram so he's speaking past
[48:35] tense god had already told this to abram
[48:37] but abram hadn't fully obeyed yet
[48:41] the lord had said unto abram get thee
[48:43] out of thy country
[48:44] and from thy kindred and from thy
[48:46] father's house
[48:48] unto a land that i will show thee and i
[48:50] will make of thee a great nation and i
[48:52] will bless thee
[48:53] and make thy name great and thou shalt
[48:55] be a blessing
[48:56] and i will bless them that bless thee
[48:58] and curse them that curseth thee
[49:00] and indeed shall all the families of the
[49:02] earth be blessed
[49:03] so abram departed as the lord had spoken
[49:06] unto him
[49:06] and lot went with him uh-oh
[49:11] that's not exactly what the lord said
[49:15] and lot went with him and abram was 75
[49:17] years old
[49:18] and he departed out of heron and he was
[49:21] going to canaan land
[49:23] so so we say in the message forsaking
[49:27] all the prophet of god says but the
[49:29] first thing he had to do
[49:31] is separate himself he separated himself
[49:34] from his people all of his loved ones
[49:36] the old associates that he used to run
[49:37] around with
[49:38] his boy her friends that come down from
[49:40] babylon with him and all his brothers
[49:42] sisters
[49:43] and all of his friends that he knew his
[49:44] associates when god called him he said
[49:46] separate yourself from your kindred get
[49:48] away from it all
[49:50] now that was hard but he separated
[49:52] himself from all his kin folks
[49:55] see god broke up that system
[49:58] so that he could get abraham alone
[50:02] but abram was so accustomed to the
[50:04] comfort of unification
[50:08] you understand man still wants
[50:11] you know man still wants a group
[50:16] it's true just look inside you'll find
[50:19] that it's right there in you
[50:22] man still finds comfort from being
[50:24] surrounded by godly people that i know
[50:26] and like like if i know god's working a
[50:28] miracle for them and them and them
[50:29] then we're okay
[50:34] man still wants a group
[50:37] he's still man still wants the security
[50:41] that comes
[50:43] from a group and abram was no different
[50:47] he wasn't declaring he was elect of god
[50:49] but he brother ben said he was just an
[50:50] ordinary man he wasn't anything special
[50:52] he was just an ordinary man but he was
[50:53] elect for ordained chosen of god
[50:57] and when god broke up that system to get
[50:59] abram free
[51:00] when abram started to go amen i don't
[51:03] know what conversation he had with his
[51:04] dad or whatever but down in er he was
[51:06] called
[51:07] but his dad decided we're all going to
[51:09] go to canaan land
[51:10] and so his dad takes them and they go on
[51:12] up to heron
[51:13] and they park in heron until terror dies
[51:16] and when tara dies the scripture says
[51:17] god had said to abram
[51:22] so now there's another opportunity for a
[51:25] greater
[51:26] separation
[51:29] and you know terror passing away and
[51:33] dying
[51:34] amen may have been a loss of a great
[51:37] comfort to abram
[51:40] it may have been sad discouraging
[51:42] disappointing
[51:43] whatever abraham may not have wanted to
[51:46] take the journey
[51:47] out of mesopotamia around the fertile
[51:49] crescent
[51:50] and all the way over into into
[51:52] canaanland all by himself
[51:53] he may have had great comfort in his dad
[51:56] leading the way
[51:57] amen but god wanted abraham alone and he
[52:00] was going to make sure
[52:01] that he didn't cross from herod over in
[52:03] the canaan land amen
[52:04] he allowed tara to die
[52:08] and you sometimes wonder why is all this
[52:10] happening to me
[52:11] why did this church break up and why did
[52:13] that preacher go off the scene and why
[52:15] did this
[52:16] happen and why did this person fall away
[52:18] and the person that led me to the
[52:19] message now they don't believe it
[52:21] anymore
[52:23] [Music]
[52:25] what's happening god wants just you amen
[52:28] just you all by yourself that's what he
[52:30] wants he wants to scatter
[52:32] us abroad that doesn't mean we don't
[52:34] come to a church that doesn't mean we
[52:35] want to fellowship
[52:36] but god doesn't want us to link
[52:38] ourselves together
[52:39] in some religious security that comes
[52:42] from a group
[52:42] he wants our security to come from our
[52:44] relationship with him
[52:46] because he's revealed himself to us he's
[52:48] given us his word we have faith amen by
[52:50] a revelation of what he's told us
[52:52] we know what the word is for our day and
[52:55] we know that we're connected to him as
[52:56] an individual
[53:00] and if we as his elect are having a
[53:02] little bit of trouble
[53:05] with separation
[53:08] then god knows how to bring separation
[53:14] see the the messages come
[53:18] to reveal to break the seals off of our
[53:20] lives
[53:23] and so we can see what god has been
[53:25] doing not just through the church ages
[53:28] but through my age from the time i was a
[53:31] little boy
[53:38] in the message god's covenant with
[53:39] abraham and his seed he says now notice
[53:41] when god called abraham he called for
[53:43] total separation
[53:45] separate yourself from your kinsmen
[53:46] separate from your father's house
[53:48] separate from all your associates
[53:50] and completely annihilate yourself from
[53:52] all these things and walk with me
[53:55] what a privilege it is when a man is
[53:57] being called like that
[53:58] how happy a real christian is to
[54:00] separate himself amen
[54:02] separate yourself
[54:05] let's turn let's turn to second
[54:08] corinthians chapter 6
[54:20] second corinthians chapter 6 and verse
[54:22] 14.
[54:27] be not unequally yoked together with
[54:29] unbelievers
[54:30] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[54:32] with unrighteousness
[54:34] and what communion has light with
[54:35] darkness and what concord hath christ
[54:38] with belial
[54:39] or what part hath he that believeth with
[54:42] an infidel
[54:43] and what agreement hath the temple of
[54:45] god with idols
[54:46] for you are the temple of the living god
[54:48] and god has said i will dwell in them
[54:50] and walk in them
[54:51] and i will be their god and they shall
[54:53] be my people
[54:54] wherefore come out from among them and
[54:56] be ye separate saith the lord
[54:58] and touch not the unclean thing and i
[55:00] will receive you
[55:02] and will be a father unto you and you
[55:03] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[55:06] lord
[55:07] almighty so god's word calls for total
[55:11] separation from unbelief
[55:14] god once is separated in the message
[55:16] redeemer redemption
[55:18] from 55 he says notice when i remember
[55:21] the time when i got saved i remember the
[55:22] time when the angel lord come and told
[55:24] me go pray for sick people
[55:26] and a great friend of mine in the
[55:28] denomination i belonged to said billy
[55:30] you're going to be a holy roller sure is
[55:32] the world my mother said why
[55:34] billy you've lost your mind my poor old
[55:36] dad that died in my arm said billy you
[55:38] can't bring that stuff around this house
[55:39] here
[55:40] they thought i was crazy the people i
[55:43] was a single man my girlfriends that i
[55:45] had been going with thought i was crazy
[55:47] but i know something happened i know
[55:49] that i could trust him
[55:50] no matter what taken place i believed
[55:52] him and you have to believe him
[55:54] sometimes he calls a total separation
[55:56] from friends and associates
[55:58] but separate yourself from the things of
[56:00] the world
[56:02] and talk with god
[56:07] man i'd like for you to turn to the book
[56:08] of exodus with me exodus 34.
[56:16] i just want to keep working this
[56:17] principle of separation
[56:20] see it in the word exodus 34
[56:25] and verse 10.
[56:29] and he said behold i make a covenant
[56:31] before all thy people
[56:32] i will do marvels such as have not been
[56:34] done in all the earth nor in any nation
[56:37] and all the people among which thou art
[56:39] shall see the work of the lord
[56:41] for it is a terrible thing that i will
[56:43] do with thee
[56:44] observe thou that which i command thee
[56:46] this day behold i drive out before thee
[56:48] the amorite and the canaanite and the
[56:50] hittite and the
[56:51] perizzite and the hivite and the
[56:53] jebusite
[56:54] take heed to thyself lest thou make a
[56:56] covenant with the inhabitants of the
[56:58] land
[56:58] whether thou go as lest it be for a
[57:00] snare in the midst of thee
[57:02] but you shall destroy their altars break
[57:05] their images
[57:05] cut down their groves for they they
[57:08] shall worship no other god
[57:09] thou shalt worship no other god for the
[57:11] lord whose name is
[57:13] jealous is a jealous god
[57:17] he hasn't changed his nature
[57:20] if he was a jealous god then he's a
[57:22] jealous god now
[57:26] for god whose name is jealous is a
[57:27] jealous god lest thou make a covenant
[57:29] with the inhabitants of the land
[57:31] and they go whoring after their gods and
[57:33] do sacrifice unto their gods
[57:35] and one called thee and thou eat of his
[57:36] sacrifice
[57:38] and they'll take of their daughters and
[57:39] to thy sons and their daughters go
[57:41] whoring after their gods and make thy
[57:43] sons go whoring after their gods
[57:45] thou shalt make no molten image so
[57:48] god is telling them now i'm bringing you
[57:50] in an exodus and i'm bringing you out
[57:52] into this land
[57:53] and when you go into this land i do not
[57:55] i'm going to drive out all the
[57:57] inhabitants of the land that was the
[57:58] promise god made them
[58:00] i will drive out all the inhabitants of
[58:02] the land and he says
[58:03] do not come into any agreement with them
[58:06] make
[58:06] no peace agreement i'm going to drive
[58:09] out all the inhabitants of the land and
[58:12] don't make a peace agreement for these
[58:14] reasons
[58:14] because if you do they'll become a snare
[58:16] to you in another place and he says
[58:18] they'll become a snare
[58:19] in your eye and a prick in your flesh
[58:24] because god wanted a total separation
[58:26] god had already given these people their
[58:28] chance amen
[58:29] they already had a chance in canaan land
[58:32] they already had a ministry of abraham
[58:34] that had moved up and down and back and
[58:36] forth amen they had already seen an
[58:37] elect seed of god
[58:39] and they still continue to go on in
[58:40] their way
[58:42] and now the the the iniquity of the
[58:45] malachites was full and god was now
[58:47] coming down in judgment
[58:48] to purge them out of his land this is
[58:50] his land
[58:52] and he's purging them out of his land
[58:54] and he tells the israelites i will drive
[58:56] them out
[58:57] but you're going to go in and fight amen
[58:59] god's going to come in here in
[59:01] partnership with israel
[59:02] he's promised to drive them out but you
[59:05] have to fight the battles
[59:08] and we want to totally separate
[59:11] from all unbelief pull down their groves
[59:14] destroy their idols burn the images
[59:18] he says totally get rid of all unbelief
[59:23] but we know that they never did
[59:26] and the very thing that they refused to
[59:28] separate from because it
[59:29] required effort it required faith in god
[59:32] it required perseverance it required all
[59:34] of these things to trust god and keep at
[59:36] his word
[59:36] until god fulfilled his word but because
[59:39] they let down on god's word
[59:41] amen they never fully conquered and they
[59:43] never fully drove out
[59:44] all the unbelief and the thing that
[59:46] remained was the very thing that became
[59:48] a trap to them
[59:49] and brought them down god wanted total
[59:52] separation
[59:54] why did god want total separation
[59:56] because he's
[59:57] a jealous god
[1:00:05] let's go to numbers 33 just going to
[1:00:07] read a couple quick places
[1:00:09] a couple more scriptures but numbers 33.
[1:00:21] i want you to see this has always always
[1:00:23] been god's plan
[1:00:26] numbers 33 and verse 50.
[1:00:34] and the lord spake unto moses in the
[1:00:36] plains of moab by jordan near jericho
[1:00:38] saying
[1:00:38] speaking to the children of israel and
[1:00:40] saying unto them when you are passed
[1:00:42] over jordan into the land of canaan
[1:00:44] then you shall drive out all the
[1:00:45] inhabitants of the land from before you
[1:00:47] and destroy all their pictures
[1:00:49] and destroy all their molten images and
[1:00:51] quite pluck down
[1:00:52] all their high places he did he used the
[1:00:54] word all
[1:00:56] all all all and you
[1:00:59] shall dispossess the inhabitants of the
[1:01:01] land and dwell therein
[1:01:03] for i have given you the land to possess
[1:01:05] it
[1:01:06] now let's go over to judges chapter 2.
[1:01:13] just two books over joshua joshua then
[1:01:16] judges judges chapter 2
[1:01:18] verse 1
[1:01:22] and the names of the lord came up from
[1:01:23] gilgal to bolcom
[1:01:25] and said i made you to go up out of
[1:01:27] egypt and i've brought you into the land
[1:01:29] which i swear unto your fathers
[1:01:31] and i said i will never break my
[1:01:32] covenant with you and you shall make no
[1:01:35] league with the inhabitants of this land
[1:01:36] you shall throw down
[1:01:38] their altars but you have not obeyed my
[1:01:40] voice
[1:01:41] why have you done this
[1:01:44] now it comes and they get a report from
[1:01:47] the lord that you haven't done what i
[1:01:49] told you to do
[1:01:50] because god when god when god broke up
[1:01:53] babylon
[1:01:54] and he laid babylon or babel ruin
[1:01:57] amen and confounded their language and
[1:01:59] scattered them abroad
[1:02:01] he did that so that he could get abraham
[1:02:03] to himself
[1:02:05] but then when god come down to redeem
[1:02:07] the nation of israel out of
[1:02:08] egypt amen he destroyed egypt and he did
[1:02:11] many signs amen and he brought a great
[1:02:13] destruction in egypt
[1:02:14] but he did that because he wanted the
[1:02:16] people to himself
[1:02:18] he's pulling a nation out of a nation
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:22] and and he wanted to bring them out into
[1:02:23] the wilderness and out in the wilderness
[1:02:25] he wanted to cleanse them with his word
[1:02:28] he wanted to purge them amen from their
[1:02:31] captivity
[1:02:32] and he wanted to wash away amen all the
[1:02:35] captivity of egypt and he wanted to
[1:02:37] bring them
[1:02:38] out and he wanted to actually purge them
[1:02:40] and purify them in the wilderness and he
[1:02:42] wanted to bring them
[1:02:43] into bula land the marriage land he
[1:02:45] wanted to marry them and bring him to
[1:02:47] the land and drive out all the
[1:02:48] inhabitants and get rid of all the dis
[1:02:51] unbelief and he wanted to be with them
[1:02:54] and he wanted to be in union with them
[1:02:56] that was god's desire what he wanted
[1:02:58] with adam and eve
[1:03:00] amen what he wanted with abraham what he
[1:03:02] wanted with the nation of israel he
[1:03:04] always wanted the same thing
[1:03:05] he's a jealous god and he wanted his
[1:03:07] elect
[1:03:08] to himself
[1:03:11] that's god's desire that's always been
[1:03:14] god's desire
[1:03:15] he wants his elect to himself
[1:03:22] you say jealous jealous jealous good or
[1:03:25] is jealous bad
[1:03:28] we we look at jealous as being bad but
[1:03:30] in this context i look at jealous as
[1:03:32] being good because he's jealous about me
[1:03:35] like i think this jealousy is beautiful
[1:03:37] i think it's wonderful
[1:03:38] he's jealous over me he's so jealous he
[1:03:41] won't let me go wrong he's so jealous
[1:03:44] over abraham he'll bring separation amen
[1:03:47] he's so jealous over abraham
[1:03:49] that if if abraham is still comforted
[1:03:51] under the headship of his father
[1:03:53] he'll allow his father to die what is
[1:03:56] that
[1:03:56] god's jealousy over his elect amen so
[1:03:59] jealous over abraham if he still
[1:04:01] just cannot part ways with lot he'll
[1:04:03] allow a dispute to come up
[1:04:05] between the herdsmen allah and the
[1:04:06] herdsmen of abraham and under contention
[1:04:08] and under a very negative atmosphere
[1:04:11] amen they'll part ways and separate
[1:04:14] what is that that's the jealous love of
[1:04:16] god and he's so
[1:04:18] jealous over you amen when you start to
[1:04:20] have affections that turn away
[1:04:22] amen god knows how to come down and rake
[1:04:24] that thing away from you because he
[1:04:26] jealously loves you
[1:04:31] i like that kind of jealousy
[1:04:35] the genesis let's go back to genesis 13.
[1:04:47] genesis 13 and verse 5.
[1:04:55] and abram went up out of egypt he and
[1:04:58] his wife
[1:04:59] and all that he had and lot with him
[1:05:01] into the south
[1:05:03] and abram was very rich in cattle and
[1:05:05] silver and gold and he went out
[1:05:07] on his journeys from the south even to
[1:05:09] bethel and to the place where he
[1:05:11] where his tent had been at the beginning
[1:05:13] between bethel and
[1:05:14] hai and to the place of the altar which
[1:05:17] he had made there at the first and
[1:05:19] there abram called on the name of the
[1:05:20] lord
[1:05:22] and lot also which went with abram had
[1:05:24] flocks and herds and tents
[1:05:26] and the land was not able to bear them
[1:05:28] that they might dwell
[1:05:29] together for their substance was great
[1:05:31] so that they could not dwell together
[1:05:34] now this is so beautiful
[1:05:40] god is now using blessing to create
[1:05:42] division
[1:05:47] abraham goes down into egypt and he goes
[1:05:49] down into egypt
[1:05:50] and and he gets nervous because his wife
[1:05:54] is fair to look upon
[1:05:55] and as he gets nervous he thinks that
[1:05:56] they might try to kill him to take her
[1:05:58] if they know that these are husbands
[1:06:00] because they believed in marriage and
[1:06:01] divorce in those days
[1:06:05] and so they knew that he had to die
[1:06:07] abraham died they were going to marry
[1:06:08] his wife
[1:06:10] so they they go down and he says now
[1:06:13] tell them you're my sister so we know
[1:06:15] the story
[1:06:16] and finally it comes out amen and
[1:06:18] pharaoh questions him and say why did
[1:06:19] you do this to us and why did you say
[1:06:21] and and it says that that that pharaoh
[1:06:24] made
[1:06:24] abraham very rich in cattle and gold and
[1:06:28] silver
[1:06:28] and then men servants and maidservants
[1:06:30] so all of a sudden
[1:06:32] uh abraham goes down there and he's not
[1:06:34] even supposed to leave the land god
[1:06:36] brought him to this land but because
[1:06:37] there was a famine he left the land
[1:06:39] abraham is an error
[1:06:42] but god is trying to shake off lot
[1:06:50] now do you understand your misunderstood
[1:06:52] life
[1:06:54] abraham's doing something that he
[1:06:56] shouldn't do because god never told him
[1:06:58] that he couldn't go to the land he never
[1:06:59] told him to leave the land
[1:07:02] and he's going down and now he he tells
[1:07:05] his
[1:07:05] wife to tell a lie and they bring a
[1:07:07] deception
[1:07:13] and god brings it out and he doesn't
[1:07:17] he doesn't uh seemingly punish abraham
[1:07:22] abraham leaves egypt and he spoiled
[1:07:24] pharaoh
[1:07:27] because he's laying a foundation for
[1:07:29] what has to come later
[1:07:30] because the seed of abraham will come
[1:07:32] down
[1:07:34] the seat of abraham will come unto egypt
[1:07:36] and when they leave egypt they have to
[1:07:38] go with a great spoil
[1:07:39] so now that abraham's here because
[1:07:40] there's a revolving history to prophecy
[1:07:44] so abraham is now just foreshadowing
[1:07:46] what will happen later
[1:07:48] he comes in and his very presence
[1:07:51] becomes a curse to pharaoh in his
[1:07:53] household
[1:07:55] now pharaoh has to push abraham out
[1:07:58] what is this this is all going to come
[1:08:00] with abraham's descendants
[1:08:02] the bible's perfect friends
[1:08:05] and so now he pushes him out but when he
[1:08:07] pushes him out he
[1:08:08] he spoils pharaoh and he spoils egypt
[1:08:10] and he leaves with great wealth
[1:08:12] and so does a lot
[1:08:15] and they leave so rich
[1:08:18] and so laden down with goods when they
[1:08:20] go back into the land where they were
[1:08:22] before
[1:08:23] that now the land cannot support both of
[1:08:25] them
[1:08:27] and what is god doing god is using
[1:08:29] blessings
[1:08:31] to bring separation
[1:08:35] praise god he knows exactly
[1:08:38] how to get his elect seed to himself
[1:08:42] and now they're both doing so well that
[1:08:45] the land cannot support them
[1:08:47] amen so so now abraham has a proposition
[1:08:52] let's see where i'm where am i at now
[1:08:56] uh 13.
[1:09:00] verse 5 a lot also which went with it
[1:09:02] with abram had flocks and herds and
[1:09:04] tents
[1:09:04] and the land was not able to bear them
[1:09:06] that they might dwell together for their
[1:09:08] substance was great so that they could
[1:09:10] not dwell together
[1:09:12] how did it get great because he went to
[1:09:14] egypt when he wasn't supposed to go to
[1:09:15] egypt
[1:09:18] and there was a strife between the
[1:09:19] herdmen of abram's cattle and the
[1:09:20] herdman of lot's cattle
[1:09:22] and the canaanite and the parasite dwelt
[1:09:24] in the land in that
[1:09:25] it dwelt then in the land and abram said
[1:09:28] unto lot
[1:09:28] let there be no strife i pray thee
[1:09:30] between me and thee
[1:09:31] and between my herdmen and thy hurting
[1:09:33] men for we be brethren
[1:09:35] it's not the whole land before thee
[1:09:37] separate thyself i pray thee from me
[1:09:39] if thou will take the left hand then i
[1:09:41] will go to the right
[1:09:43] if thou depart to the right then i will
[1:09:45] go to the left
[1:09:46] and lot lifted up his eyes and behold
[1:09:48] all the plane of jordan
[1:09:50] that it was well watered everywhere it
[1:09:52] was well watered everywhere before the
[1:09:55] lord destroyed sodom and gomorrh even as
[1:09:57] the garden of the lord like the land of
[1:09:59] egypt
[1:10:00] as thou comest unto zore then lot chose
[1:10:03] him all the plain of jordan and lot
[1:10:04] journeyed east
[1:10:05] and they separated themselves the one
[1:10:07] from the other and abram dwelt
[1:10:09] in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in
[1:10:11] the cities of the plain and pitched his
[1:10:13] tent
[1:10:13] towards sodom but the men of sodom were
[1:10:16] wicked and sinners before the lord
[1:10:18] exceedingly and the lord said unto abram
[1:10:21] after that lot was separated from him
[1:10:23] lift up now lift up
[1:10:26] now lift up now
[1:10:30] thine eyes and look from the place where
[1:10:32] thou art northward
[1:10:33] and southward and eastward and westward
[1:10:36] where did he get him to amen even lot
[1:10:40] and his carnality went down to the
[1:10:42] well-watered jordan because
[1:10:44] it was fertile it was fruitful he could
[1:10:46] be have progress and he could prosper
[1:10:48] there
[1:10:48] and even he moved down there which would
[1:10:51] force abraham to go the other way and
[1:10:53] where did god get abraham
[1:10:54] he got him smack dab in the middle of
[1:10:57] the promised land
[1:11:00] and he got him in the middle of the
[1:11:01] promised land which was not the better
[1:11:03] piece of land
[1:11:03] like the plains of jordan but it was the
[1:11:06] exact predestinated spot where he needed
[1:11:09] to be
[1:11:09] when he finally come into full
[1:11:11] separation he's standing in the middle
[1:11:13] of the land
[1:11:14] he said now lift up your eyes look
[1:11:16] northward look southward look to the
[1:11:18] east and look to the west
[1:11:19] why he's standing in the middle of the
[1:11:22] promised land
[1:11:23] because god is perfect and god is
[1:11:25] jealous and god
[1:11:26] always wanted to get abraham by himself
[1:11:28] to this place so that he could give him
[1:11:30] the promise
[1:11:33] and all the wonderings and movings and
[1:11:35] shiftings and right and wrong and in and
[1:11:37] out and all of it is because god has got
[1:11:40] to get abraham his elect predestinated
[1:11:43] seed
[1:11:43] in his program to his spot amen so that
[1:11:46] he can reveal to him
[1:11:48] all this word is yours
[1:11:52] from genesis to revelation in the old
[1:11:54] testament and new testament
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:57] it's all yours amen i've separated you
[1:12:00] from denominations
[1:12:01] you've had so much strife and trouble
[1:12:04] and so many things that have happened in
[1:12:05] your life
[1:12:06] but i'm trying to break the babylonian
[1:12:08] system i'm trying
[1:12:09] amen i'm trying to break it down where
[1:12:11] they don't understand your language
[1:12:13] anymore you don't understand your
[1:12:14] language anymore you're not even
[1:12:16] speaking the same thing anymore
[1:12:19] and even the ones that would come out
[1:12:21] with you originally
[1:12:24] god would allow them to fade off the
[1:12:26] scene or it would bring a contention
[1:12:28] where they would have to go one way and
[1:12:30] you would have to go the other way
[1:12:32] amen because god
[1:12:35] is bringing separation because
[1:12:37] separation
[1:12:38] is bringing relationship
[1:12:42] why the separation listen
[1:12:45] it's not separation because this one's
[1:12:47] bad and this one's good and
[1:12:49] it has nothing to do with it the
[1:12:51] separation is all about god being a
[1:12:53] jealous god and he wants a relationship
[1:12:54] with just you
[1:12:56] and he's so jealous he doesn't want you
[1:12:58] comforted by
[1:12:59] this one or that one or or this church
[1:13:02] or that system or this
[1:13:05] if any of those comforts are coming
[1:13:07] between his
[1:13:08] jealous love for you and if it's
[1:13:11] dividing your focus if it's
[1:13:12] if it's causing you of affection
[1:13:14] somewhere else or comfort or
[1:13:16] our confidence and something else god
[1:13:17] will see to it that that thing gets
[1:13:19] broke somehow
[1:13:20] and separated off because he's a jealous
[1:13:22] god with a jealous love
[1:13:24] and he wants you and just you
[1:13:28] and somehow through it all he'll bring
[1:13:31] you right back
[1:13:34] to the middle of the promised land
[1:13:38] and when you get all by yourself i'm
[1:13:41] wondering how did i get to this place in
[1:13:43] my life
[1:13:46] you say now lift up thine eyes
[1:13:50] and look from genesis to revelation
[1:13:54] from before the foundation of the world
[1:13:56] to the new heavens and new earth
[1:13:57] it's all yours i've given it all to you
[1:14:02] oh praise god praise god praise god
[1:14:08] read that again in verse 14 the lord
[1:14:10] said unto abram after that lot was
[1:14:12] separated from him that was the last
[1:14:14] separation lift up now nine eyes and
[1:14:17] look from the place where thou art
[1:14:18] northward and southward and eastward and
[1:14:20] westward
[1:14:21] for all the land which thou seest to
[1:14:23] thee will i give it until thy seed aft
[1:14:26] seed forever and i will make thy seed as
[1:14:28] the dust of the earth so that if a man
[1:14:30] can number the dust of the earth
[1:14:32] then shall thy seed also be numbered
[1:14:34] arise
[1:14:35] walk through the land and the length of
[1:14:37] it and in the breath of it
[1:14:38] for i will give it unto thee then abram
[1:14:41] removed his tent and came and dwelt in
[1:14:43] the plain of memory
[1:14:45] which is in hebron and built there an
[1:14:47] altar
[1:14:48] unto the lord it says god's
[1:14:51] jealous love
[1:14:55] brother brahm says in jehovah jerusalem
[1:14:57] total separation from all unbelief
[1:15:00] and remember abraham the patriarch was
[1:15:02] never absolutely
[1:15:03] fully blessed until he obeyed exactly
[1:15:06] what god said do
[1:15:08] and we'll never never be blessed
[1:15:11] any and have the blessings until we obey
[1:15:13] what god said
[1:15:18] i want to just take a if i could just
[1:15:20] take about five minutes and i want to
[1:15:22] compare and contrast
[1:15:23] nimrod and abraham
[1:15:28] nimrod under nimrod's ministry and with
[1:15:30] imran's idea
[1:15:32] nimrod gathered the people
[1:15:36] but under abraham's dispensation
[1:15:39] abraham kept separating from the people
[1:15:46] nimrod formed a system for worship
[1:15:50] abraham had no system for worship
[1:15:54] he built an altar he worshiped god and
[1:15:56] he left
[1:15:58] he didn't start a church sometimes he'd
[1:16:00] come back to that old
[1:16:01] offer again then he would be off to
[1:16:02] someplace else and build another altar
[1:16:05] he was just moving with god worshiping
[1:16:07] as he moved
[1:16:10] nimrod had a system abraham had no
[1:16:12] system
[1:16:15] nimrod tried to produce a mechanism to
[1:16:18] protect himself
[1:16:20] what was he protecting himself from he
[1:16:22] was trying to protect himself from the
[1:16:23] judgments of god
[1:16:25] but in doing so he proved his disbelief
[1:16:28] in god's word
[1:16:31] and his protective mechanism was trying
[1:16:34] to produce
[1:16:35] the promise because the promise was i
[1:16:37] will not destroy you with the flood
[1:16:39] again
[1:16:41] so his efforts is trying to produce a
[1:16:44] mechanism that will protect him
[1:16:47] produced the word of god only he wanted
[1:16:50] to do it
[1:16:52] because he didn't trust god to do it
[1:16:56] abraham failed
[1:16:59] by trying to protect himself
[1:17:03] abraham tried to protect himself and it
[1:17:05] failed
[1:17:06] he tried to say amen they'll kill me you
[1:17:09] you're telling me he tried to protect
[1:17:10] himself
[1:17:12] and he tried to produce the promise
[1:17:16] and it failed god would never let it
[1:17:19] work out
[1:17:21] he tried to protect himself he failed he
[1:17:24] tried to produce the promise
[1:17:25] it failed god was the one who protected
[1:17:28] abraham
[1:17:30] and then god was the one who produced
[1:17:32] the promise
[1:17:33] without any help from abraham
[1:17:38] nimrod put a great deal of effort and
[1:17:40] money in finances
[1:17:42] and all of his intellect and wisdom into
[1:17:44] trying to produce
[1:17:46] the word
[1:17:49] abraham could not do anything to produce
[1:17:53] the word
[1:17:53] abraham did not put in effort he did not
[1:17:55] put in money he did not have to
[1:17:57] use stamina energy
[1:18:01] all he had to do was believe god and
[1:18:04] when he believed god
[1:18:05] and he how did he believe god this is so
[1:18:07] key how did he believe god
[1:18:09] he recognized him when he came in his
[1:18:12] day in another form
[1:18:17] he recognized that was elohim there
[1:18:20] that was eating flesh drinking milk he
[1:18:22] had his feet
[1:18:23] washed that was elohim he recognized god
[1:18:26] in his present-day expression
[1:18:30] proving that he believed god
[1:18:34] and all he had to do was believe god and
[1:18:37] when he believed god
[1:18:40] god now performed the promise without
[1:18:43] any help from abraham
[1:18:47] abraham couldn't change his body
[1:18:49] couldn't change sarah's body
[1:18:50] god did that on his own in due season
[1:18:54] in fit time god did it with no help from
[1:18:56] abraham
[1:18:59] praise god
[1:19:03] nimrod believed in god
[1:19:08] but did not believe god
[1:19:13] abraham believed in god
[1:19:16] and believed god
[1:19:19] and because of that he was justified
[1:19:23] because nimrod believed in god but
[1:19:25] didn't believe god he was condemned
[1:19:28] because abraham believed god he was
[1:19:31] justified
[1:19:34] nimrod was the enemy of god
[1:19:39] and abraham was called the friend of god
[1:19:43] these are two drastically different
[1:19:46] characters in the bible
[1:19:48] and god is showing man
[1:19:51] versus his alexei the false and the true
[1:19:55] vine
[1:19:56] on display again
[1:19:59] let's turn to the book of james i just
[1:20:01] want to read a couple more verses here
[1:20:02] out of the bible
[1:20:05] as we wrap up james 2
[1:20:08] james chapter 2
[1:20:16] and verse 23.
[1:20:24] james chapter 2 verse 23 and the
[1:20:26] scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:20:28] abraham believed god and it was imputed
[1:20:31] in him for righteousness
[1:20:33] and he was called the friend of god
[1:20:38] see god was separating for relationship
[1:20:44] god was jealous over his love of his
[1:20:45] elect and it was
[1:20:47] god not anyone else it was god
[1:20:50] who called abraham his friend
[1:20:54] let's pick that up in isaiah so you can
[1:20:56] read it in your bible isaiah 41
[1:20:59] this is not the only place that says
[1:21:01] says it but it's here in isaiah
[1:21:05] isaiah 41
[1:21:08] and god is speaking to isaiah
[1:21:16] and let's just read one verse isaiah 41
[1:21:20] and verse 8 but thou israel art my
[1:21:23] servant jacob whom i have chosen the
[1:21:25] seed of abraham
[1:21:27] my friend
[1:21:30] boy all that abraham went through and
[1:21:33] his wanderings and his separations and
[1:21:34] all that
[1:21:35] i think it's worth it to be called his
[1:21:37] friend
[1:21:38] i think that shows what god wanted god
[1:21:40] wanted abraham as his
[1:21:42] friend he wanted a relationship with
[1:21:43] abraham so god
[1:21:45] required separation for the purpose of
[1:21:48] relationship
[1:21:49] and god in this day is calling for
[1:21:51] separation for the purpose
[1:21:53] of relationship
[1:21:57] let's go back to james
[1:22:02] go back to where we were in james
[1:22:09] james chapter four
[1:22:21] all right james chapter 4
[1:22:24] and verse 4.
[1:22:29] ye adulterers and adulteresses know you
[1:22:32] not that the friendship of the world
[1:22:34] is enmity with god
[1:22:37] do you want to be god's friend or do you
[1:22:39] want to be an enmity with god
[1:22:42] friendship with the world is enmity with
[1:22:44] god for whosoever therefore will be a
[1:22:46] friend of the world is the enemy of god
[1:22:51] this is why god's word calls for total
[1:22:53] separation from unbelief
[1:22:55] because if you'll be a friend of the
[1:22:57] world you'll be an enemy to god
[1:22:59] but god doesn't want you to be his enemy
[1:23:01] god wants you to
[1:23:02] separate from the world and the things
[1:23:04] of the world because he wants
[1:23:06] a relationship amen amen go over to
[1:23:09] first john
[1:23:10] just a couple books over first john
[1:23:12] chapter 2.
[1:23:17] and verse 15. john chapter 2 verse 15
[1:23:21] love not the world neither the things
[1:23:23] that are in the world
[1:23:24] if any man love if any man love the
[1:23:27] world the love of the father is not in
[1:23:29] him
[1:23:30] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:23:31] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[1:23:33] the pride of life is not of the father
[1:23:35] but is of the world and the world passes
[1:23:38] away and all the lust thereof but he
[1:23:40] that doeth the will of god
[1:23:41] abideth forever
[1:23:45] now let's go back to john the gospel of
[1:23:47] john
[1:23:49] chapter 15.
[1:23:55] john 15
[1:23:58] and verse 12.
[1:24:02] the gospel of john chapter 15 verse 12
[1:24:04] this is my commandment
[1:24:06] that you love one another as i have
[1:24:07] loved you greater love has no man than
[1:24:10] this that a man laid down his life
[1:24:12] for his friends and ye are my friends
[1:24:17] now jesus christ has called his
[1:24:19] disciples and he
[1:24:20] separated them out and he's drawn them
[1:24:22] to himself
[1:24:23] and now he calls them friends you are my
[1:24:26] friends
[1:24:27] if you do whatsoever i command you
[1:24:29] henceforth i call you not servants for
[1:24:31] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[1:24:33] doeth
[1:24:34] but i have called you friends for all
[1:24:36] things that i have heard of my father
[1:24:38] i have made known unto you
[1:24:41] the friendship brought the revelations
[1:24:46] he said i don't call you a servant
[1:24:48] because
[1:24:49] i'm telling you everything the father
[1:24:51] gave me now i'm
[1:24:52] sharing with you that makes you my
[1:24:54] friend
[1:24:55] the revelation of the word brings a
[1:24:57] greater intimacy
[1:24:59] the revelation from the father that
[1:25:01] christ brings to his bride
[1:25:03] brings a greater intimacy he goes i
[1:25:05] can't call you
[1:25:06] servants anymore because all things that
[1:25:09] my father
[1:25:10] showed me i have showed you so now i
[1:25:13] have to call you
[1:25:14] friends this is why
[1:25:17] god wants to separate us is because he
[1:25:20] wants to reveal himself to us
[1:25:21] because he wants to have a relationship
[1:25:24] with us
[1:25:26] but the the devil is trying to recreate
[1:25:29] systems
[1:25:30] all around us so that we
[1:25:33] gain comfort in the group comfort and
[1:25:36] the strong man
[1:25:37] comfort in the the spiritual intercessor
[1:25:41] that's not christ but another system or
[1:25:44] another man or another form of religion
[1:25:47] because he's trying to break this unity
[1:25:50] with god and man
[1:25:52] and god is jealous over this
[1:25:55] relationship
[1:25:59] he goes on to say
[1:26:02] verse 16 you have not chosen me
[1:26:07] but i have chosen you
[1:26:11] you cannot choose to become god's friend
[1:26:15] god has already chosen to be yours
[1:26:19] abraham couldn't choose to have this
[1:26:22] jealous love of god
[1:26:23] watch over him and follow him and
[1:26:25] separate him out so that he can bring a
[1:26:26] revelation
[1:26:28] of the promised inheritance it was god
[1:26:31] who chose abraham these disciples didn't
[1:26:35] choose jesus
[1:26:36] christ jesus christ chose these
[1:26:37] disciples
[1:26:39] and he ordained them and he told them
[1:26:42] all that the father showed him
[1:26:43] so now he's changing the relationship
[1:26:46] from servant
[1:26:47] because there's a greater intimacy that
[1:26:48] comes with separation and now your
[1:26:51] friend
[1:26:54] so you can go from servant to friend
[1:26:58] but in this day he wants to go from
[1:27:00] friend
[1:27:01] to bride it's going to require election
[1:27:07] and choosing calling
[1:27:10] separating and revealing to make a
[1:27:12] friend
[1:27:13] what's it going to take to make a bride
[1:27:17] a total separation from all unbelief
[1:27:21] brother benham says in the message
[1:27:23] shalom he says god is a jealous god
[1:27:25] he is jealous and he wants his wife pure
[1:27:28] he wants her virgin
[1:27:29] chaste nothing in the world into her at
[1:27:31] all all together his word
[1:27:33] part of him we must be part of the word
[1:27:36] not part of the creed part of the word
[1:27:37] not part of the church
[1:27:39] part of the a part of the bride church
[1:27:41] is condemned we know that she goes to
[1:27:43] outer darkness
[1:27:44] but the bride goes up and the message
[1:27:47] god's word calls for total separation
[1:27:49] from unbelief in 1964
[1:27:51] he said paul was a nazarite unto the
[1:27:53] lord he was separated from his orthodox
[1:27:56] church to the world
[1:27:57] word of the living god aaron was a
[1:28:00] nazarite unto the lord he was separated
[1:28:02] from among the brethren to bear the
[1:28:03] birthstones and to be the high priest
[1:28:06] it is a total separation we're not to go
[1:28:08] back into the world
[1:28:09] no more or have anything to do with the
[1:28:11] world but cleave only unto god
[1:28:13] jesus is coming for a bride a woman a
[1:28:15] church that's separated from the things
[1:28:17] of the world
[1:28:18] or the cares of the world she is
[1:28:19] separated from the fashions of this
[1:28:21] modern age that we live in
[1:28:22] she is separated from the cares of the
[1:28:24] traditions of the churches
[1:28:25] she is separated only to god and god is
[1:28:28] the word
[1:28:29] and as husband and wife as one so does
[1:28:32] the bride and the word become one
[1:28:34] for the word is living through the bride
[1:28:36] that's how that's her credentials
[1:28:38] that's her identification
[1:28:41] in the message scriptural signs of the
[1:28:43] times from 64 he says but remember
[1:28:45] the bride will be called out separated
[1:28:47] indifferent
[1:28:48] filled holy ghost born washed in the
[1:28:51] blood of the lamb
[1:28:52] she'll abstain from everything that's
[1:28:54] filthy around her husband
[1:28:56] she's a chaste virgin pure by the word
[1:28:59] the word and her
[1:29:00] are the same as a man and his wife
[1:29:02] become one in union so does the real
[1:29:04] genuine church of god
[1:29:07] see god is a jealous god and he wants a
[1:29:09] pure
[1:29:11] virgin unadulterated clean wife
[1:29:15] and so what has he got to do to have
[1:29:17] that kind of a wife
[1:29:18] he's got to bring a separation and he's
[1:29:20] got to separate her from
[1:29:22] all the traditions and creeds and
[1:29:24] doctrines
[1:29:25] of denominational systems he's got to
[1:29:27] break babylon again
[1:29:30] and he's got to separate her out and
[1:29:32] he's got to keep
[1:29:33] separating her she may try to come out
[1:29:35] of the denominations but bring a few of
[1:29:37] those ideas along and he cuts it away
[1:29:41] keep a few of those relationships away
[1:29:42] along and he cuts them away
[1:29:44] and he cuts away and he cuts away and he
[1:29:46] cuts away
[1:29:47] until he gets just her and her alone
[1:29:50] until
[1:29:51] then he pours his water over her and he
[1:29:53] begins to wash her with the water of the
[1:29:56] word
[1:29:56] to make her so he can present to himself
[1:29:59] a spotless bride
[1:30:00] without blemish or any such thing
[1:30:04] abraham couldn't produce anything the
[1:30:06] bride
[1:30:07] can't produce anything but he is
[1:30:10] separating her
[1:30:11] to himself he is washing her with the
[1:30:14] word
[1:30:14] he says if you won't stay under the
[1:30:17] water of this word
[1:30:18] how are you going to be washed from the
[1:30:20] spotted spots of these prostitutes
[1:30:23] it's not anything that we can do to
[1:30:25] ourselves the only thing we can do is
[1:30:27] submit and surrender as he cuts away
[1:30:30] let it go as he separates let it go
[1:30:34] as he washes with the word and the word
[1:30:35] begins to wash away ideas
[1:30:37] let them go as the word begins to wash
[1:30:40] away habits
[1:30:41] let them go as the word begins to wash
[1:30:43] away even
[1:30:44] old things that used to hang on in your
[1:30:46] and your mind
[1:30:48] old habits old ways of thinking let them
[1:30:51] go
[1:30:51] and surrender to the one that's
[1:30:53] purifying you by his word
[1:30:56] why what is this this is his jealous
[1:31:00] love
[1:31:02] so that he can present to himself
[1:31:08] a bride without spot
[1:31:11] or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:31:16] and now he's drawing her up close to his
[1:31:18] side
[1:31:20] because he's cutting things off of her
[1:31:24] he's washing her with the word to
[1:31:26] present himself
[1:31:27] a virgin bride and he draws her up close
[1:31:30] to him
[1:31:31] and he whispers love secrets
[1:31:34] in her ear he spoke in parables to the
[1:31:38] multitudes but
[1:31:39] behind closed doors with his disciples
[1:31:43] he made them friends by revealing to
[1:31:47] them what the parables meant
[1:31:50] and now he's brought the bride separated
[1:31:53] from the nomination
[1:31:54] separated from ideas of man and brought
[1:31:57] her to himself
[1:31:58] into the land and now he's whispering
[1:32:01] the secrets behind the secrets
[1:32:06] why because he's making her
[1:32:09] his lovely bride by separation
[1:32:13] and revelation the relationship is
[1:32:16] getting more intimate
[1:32:17] and more intimate and more intimate
[1:32:21] not servants from servants to friends
[1:32:24] now not
[1:32:25] friends from friends to bride
[1:32:29] this is what god wants and this is what
[1:32:32] we want
[1:32:34] let's finish with two verses out of
[1:32:36] revelation revelation 18.
[1:32:40] and verse 4 revelation 18
[1:32:43] 4
[1:32:48] and i heard another voice from heaven
[1:32:50] saying come out of her my people
[1:32:52] that you be not partakers of your sins
[1:32:54] and you receive not
[1:32:56] of her plagues go to revelation 19
[1:33:02] verse 5. and a voice came out of the
[1:33:05] throne saying praise our god
[1:33:06] all his servants and ye that fear him
[1:33:08] both small and great
[1:33:10] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[1:33:11] great multitude and as the voice of many
[1:33:13] waters and as the voice of mighty
[1:33:14] thunderings
[1:33:15] saying alleluia for the lord god
[1:33:17] omnipotent reigneth
[1:33:19] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:33:21] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:33:23] lamb has come
[1:33:24] and his wife hath made herself
[1:33:27] ready and to her was granted that she
[1:33:30] should be arrayed in fine line and clean
[1:33:33] and white for the fine linen
[1:33:36] is the righteousness of the saints
[1:33:40] god has sent a word to wash his bride
[1:33:44] he has sent a word to clothe his bride
[1:33:48] so that she will be clothed in his very
[1:33:50] own righteousness
[1:33:52] the bride has made herself ready how
[1:33:54] what did she do
[1:33:56] she just wore the garments
[1:33:59] she just took what what god gave through
[1:34:02] a prophet
[1:34:02] and she just put it on and she didn't
[1:34:05] add to it
[1:34:05] and she didn't take from it she let the
[1:34:08] word wash her and she let the word
[1:34:10] clothe her
[1:34:12] and she has made herself ready
[1:34:15] because that's what this jealous god
[1:34:18] has wanted amen let's stand
[1:34:22] musicians if you'd come for the blake if
[1:34:24] you'd come
[1:34:32] the bride is separated from everything
[1:34:36] that is not the word that's the work
[1:34:39] that he's doing today
[1:34:40] he wants to separate the bride what does
[1:34:42] he want to separate me from
[1:34:44] everything that's not the word he wants
[1:34:47] to separate you from
[1:34:48] because this has to be a word bribe
[1:34:52] she is washed by the word purified by
[1:34:55] the word
[1:34:57] clothed in the word she is becoming the
[1:35:01] manifestation of the word
[1:35:03] the word is flowing through her she is
[1:35:06] be
[1:35:07] she is becoming one with the word she is
[1:35:09] becoming
[1:35:10] the word amen praise god
[1:35:15] the separation is bringing a deeper
[1:35:18] intimacy
[1:35:19] and bringing a relationship and satan
[1:35:22] would love to convince
[1:35:25] god's children to go back into a system
[1:35:30] say brother chad i would never go back
[1:35:32] to the pentecostal church baptist church
[1:35:33] catholic church
[1:35:34] you don't have to go anywhere else to be
[1:35:37] in a system
[1:35:40] if you bring the systematic thinking
[1:35:42] into your heart and your mind
[1:35:44] and you begin to worship in the seat
[1:35:46] you're sitting in now
[1:35:48] like you worshiped in that system amen
[1:35:50] you
[1:35:51] are under the system you are still
[1:35:55] under the roman system and don't think
[1:35:57] that the devil is trying to fight
[1:35:58] baptism trying to fight methodists and
[1:36:00] he is trying to disrupt the bride
[1:36:04] he is trying to keep you from the
[1:36:06] washing of the water of the world
[1:36:07] he's trying to keep you from being the
[1:36:09] virgin spotless bride that you're called
[1:36:10] to be in this hour
[1:36:11] and he's trying to keep you from wearing
[1:36:13] that garment
[1:36:15] because when the bride has made herself
[1:36:17] ready there's a cry and a shout and
[1:36:19] thunderings that goes off in heaven and
[1:36:21] said hallelujah praise to our god
[1:36:23] for the marriage of the bride has come
[1:36:24] and the bride has made herself ready
[1:36:26] all of heaven is waiting for this
[1:36:28] friends
[1:36:30] and there's a battle going on all around
[1:36:32] the bride satan is trying to stop that
[1:36:34] from happening
[1:36:35] and god has slowly moving and molding
[1:36:38] and washing and purging
[1:36:40] and getting the bride into this
[1:36:41] condition and she's surrendering and
[1:36:43] yielding and
[1:36:44] feeding on the word and putting it on
[1:36:46] her and the devil is trying to bring
[1:36:48] another barrier
[1:36:49] to block the intimacy with god
[1:36:54] if he can get you to think group he's
[1:36:56] got you
[1:36:58] if he can get you to rely on a preacher
[1:37:00] he's got you
[1:37:02] if he can get you to trust in your
[1:37:04] church he's got you
[1:37:09] but when god and his jealous love comes
[1:37:11] to you and just you
[1:37:14] and you know he's talking to you and
[1:37:16] just you
[1:37:17] and you know he loves you and you know
[1:37:18] you love him and you know you've met a
[1:37:20] living god
[1:37:21] and you're in contact with god amen then
[1:37:24] everything else becomes secondary
[1:37:26] that becomes the only thing and that's
[1:37:28] what god wants
[1:37:31] that's why he brings separation not so
[1:37:33] that we can be
[1:37:34] another sect of another holiness
[1:37:38] movement
[1:37:40] that's not the purpose for separation
[1:37:42] the separation is not to become
[1:37:43] i mean now we're the correct pilgrim
[1:37:45] holiness because they fell
[1:37:49] another amish another mennonite another
[1:37:52] wesleyan that's not separation it wasn't
[1:37:55] separation for that reason not to start
[1:37:57] a new movement or a new code of conduct
[1:37:59] or new rules he separated you to himself
[1:38:02] so that he can have an intimate
[1:38:03] relationship with you
[1:38:04] so he can whisper the love secrets in
[1:38:06] your ears so that you'll realize
[1:38:07] you're the bride
[1:38:11] and the devil is trying everything to
[1:38:14] stop that level of intimacy
[1:38:17] but praise god you can't win amen
[1:38:22] tried to trip up abraham got him in
[1:38:25] babylon
[1:38:26] god broke the whole system up to get him
[1:38:28] out
[1:38:31] got him to take his dad along his dad
[1:38:33] died
[1:38:35] got him to take lot along well we'll
[1:38:37] just prosper him so much
[1:38:40] that they can't even live together
[1:38:41] anymore
[1:38:43] what is this the jealous love of god
[1:38:48] separating separating separating
[1:38:51] separating
[1:38:52] until now he's standing in the middle of
[1:38:54] the land all by himself
[1:38:56] just him and god and god says
[1:39:00] now look to the north
[1:39:03] to the south when god gets you right
[1:39:06] smack dab in the middle of his promise
[1:39:08] for this day
[1:39:08] just you and him and he says
[1:39:12] it's all yours you're a joint heir with
[1:39:15] me
[1:39:15] all that i've inherited you've inherited
[1:39:17] too
[1:39:18] look from before the foundation in the
[1:39:20] mind of god look to the new heavens and
[1:39:22] new earth
