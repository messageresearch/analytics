[3:22] [Music]
[3:31] my lord
[3:36] and he'll give rest
[3:42] [Applause]
[3:44] to
[3:50] there's no doubt
[4:08] there is
[4:38] [Music]
[4:40] if
[4:42] there's no doubt
[4:46] about it
[4:58] praise god let's bow our head with a
[5:01] prayer
[5:03] heavenly father we can do
[5:06] too many too many things too much
[5:11] we cannot pray too much once again
[5:15] we're inviting your presence to come in
[5:18] a mist
[5:19] and take control of the service
[5:22] you're the author of the word
[5:25] father we we went to school we can read
[5:29] but it takes you to give us the contest
[5:32] it takes you to give us the inspiration
[5:37] so we're calling upon your name tonight
[5:39] father because
[5:41] your children did not come to hear from
[5:44] a man
[5:46] but they want to hear from you give them
[5:49] the desire of their heart father
[5:52] speak to them the way
[5:55] only you can do that so we just commit
[5:59] ourselves
[5:59] to you use us as a tool
[6:03] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[6:05] pray
[6:06] amen amen thank you musicians
[6:13] let's just go straight to the word
[6:19] um we're going to look at
[6:22] romans chapter 7
[6:27] verse 21 well-known
[6:30] verse when well-known scripture
[6:34] [Applause]
[6:40] romans chapter 7
[6:44] is on the screen too
[6:48] i find then a law that when
[6:51] i would do good evil is present with me
[6:55] for i delight in the law of god after
[6:58] the
[6:59] inward man but i
[7:02] see another law in my members wearing
[7:05] against the law of my mind
[7:08] and bringing me into captivity to the
[7:11] law of sin
[7:12] which is in my members o wretched
[7:16] man that i am who shall deliver me
[7:20] from the body of this death
[7:23] may god add this blessing to the reading
[7:25] of the world
[7:27] you miss it you may take your seat
[7:34] i want to greet you in the name of the
[7:35] lord jesus christ
[7:38] it's always a privilege to speak to his
[7:40] bride
[7:42] so um you
[7:45] uh you pray for me and uh
[7:49] so god can take all these things that
[7:52] sometimes he pulls
[7:54] on the preachers and god can
[7:57] can streamline them so it can make sense
[8:01] when i'm getting them that makes sense
[8:04] you can really enjoy it but now
[8:08] you gotta give it to the people so
[8:11] we really need him here hey
[8:14] man
[8:19] okay i'm gonna read a portion of uh
[8:23] push a quote let me take a quote
[8:27] again this is uh powerpoint so there are
[8:31] things that
[8:32] i don't want to see now they appearing
[8:35] so
[8:36] but let's just go with this one
[8:39] questions and answer
[8:41] uh 64 brother bernam say
[8:46] the inside man says that's true
[8:49] the outside man reasons that it can
[8:53] be true to you then ignore
[8:57] the outside man and accept the inside
[9:00] man
[9:02] brother branham is explaining to us
[9:05] romans chapter 7
[9:06] 21. this to the story
[9:10] is they are too being
[9:13] within ourself excuse me for the
[9:15] terminologies they may not be
[9:17] completely right and they are fighting
[9:21] and the the inside
[9:25] outside men need to
[9:29] ignore and accept i mean you have to
[9:32] ignore the outside man
[9:35] which is your conscience which is your
[9:38] spirit the human spirit and accept the
[9:41] inside man who is the soul
[9:45] now that the same thing paul speaking of
[9:49] uh he was sold under the law of
[9:52] lord to colonel sin every one of us
[9:55] is the same that's the reason we have
[9:58] the troubles we do
[10:00] of marriage for five times and this and
[10:03] that
[10:04] and all kinds of sin and adulteries
[10:07] and everything else along in our lives
[10:10] is because of those things
[10:12] we are colonel and that
[10:15] part must perish but when
[10:18] inside we are a spirit man's
[10:21] soul inside that's faith in god's word
[10:25] then we bring our outside body
[10:29] under subjection to the word
[10:32] by faith by accepting what god said
[10:36] that's the challenge amen
[10:39] and that's the challenge that uh is
[10:42] in front of us but if god speaks to us
[10:45] it means it give us the power of
[10:49] transformation
[10:52] so badabanam continues and how can i
[10:55] take a cocober and make a grain of wheat
[10:59] out of it it is impossible for me to do
[11:03] it
[11:03] the only way i can i can be is because
[11:07] inside that cocoa bird
[11:10] has been transmitted from clockwork with
[11:14] a coca bear to a germ called with life
[11:18] then you bury that coco and it will
[11:21] produce a grain of wheat
[11:23] that's right see because there has been
[11:27] a life of wheat put in the cocoa bird
[11:30] and and the life of cocoa bear has been
[11:32] taken out
[11:34] but the nature of the cocoa bird is
[11:37] still
[11:37] sticky and it will be until this
[11:41] new life has fully been developed
[11:45] out of the ground and raised up again
[11:49] so we we know these things but uh
[11:52] it looks like that's the direction
[11:56] the lord wants us to go tonight so we're
[11:59] going to
[11:59] just talk about them so
[12:02] what is it is say that this nature
[12:06] that we have is a allowed by god
[12:11] permitted by god it was not his perfect
[12:14] will
[12:15] so god what he does is when he wants us
[12:18] to
[12:19] have a different nature he has to put
[12:23] his own nature in us that's why he
[12:26] called the
[12:27] wheat grain
[12:30] uh in this old old cocoa bird that
[12:34] we our natural natural
[12:37] spirit represent and when god
[12:41] does this then the coconut life
[12:44] is transformed into the wheat life
[12:48] however since it's not the original
[12:53] the sticky nature of that cocoa bird
[12:56] remains
[12:58] and that's the fight and that's why
[13:01] tonight i want to call my
[13:04] message uh this barrier
[13:08] called human spirit
[13:12] this barrier called human spirit
[13:17] all right um
[13:22] and when it it comes forth then it's
[13:25] no more coco bird but wheat but wait
[13:29] but while it's here on earth
[13:32] uh in out of the earth and a coca bird
[13:36] is still sticky but it got the
[13:39] nature on the inside of it
[13:42] of wheat and as long as you are in this
[13:46] life you are going to be sticky and have
[13:49] a
[13:50] colonel nature that is going to bother
[13:53] you as long as you live
[13:55] but the inside of you you are born again
[13:59] and when you
[13:59] raise up you are in the likeness of
[14:02] christ and all the sin has gone from you
[14:06] that's the thing amen
[14:10] so that nature even though you are born
[14:13] again you
[14:14] love the lord you want to serve him
[14:17] but that at the nature is sticky
[14:22] and it's going to bother you and the
[14:24] more you mature
[14:26] in the lord the more it impossible
[14:31] but you gotta fight it with the tools
[14:35] that are
[14:36] already inside you that god
[14:39] gave you yes
[14:43] this is what the prophet says again
[14:45] about that
[14:48] uh the thirst in 1965.
[14:52] like paul say describe as in romans
[14:56] chapter 7 21 when i would do
[14:59] good then the evil is nigh when are you
[15:02] trying
[15:03] did you ever had that inexperienced
[15:06] christians
[15:08] that when you're trying to do something
[15:10] that is worthwhile
[15:12] go to make an effort to do something
[15:14] that's good
[15:15] then you find out that there is the
[15:18] devil and
[15:19] on every hand just to upset you
[15:22] everything that you and that's one
[15:25] good thing that i would like to say this
[15:28] that christians might know that when
[15:32] when you are starting to do something
[15:34] there is something always
[15:35] trying to upset you in doing it do it
[15:39] anyhow
[15:42] amen and sometimes we say it
[15:45] it's not the will of god because i tried
[15:48] before brother
[15:50] oh brother but i'm saying no that's not
[15:52] right he say that's the devil they're
[15:54] trying to keep you from doing what's
[15:56] right
[15:58] now how many times i meet people that's
[16:01] prone to be a little nervous when they
[16:04] found out that they're
[16:05] trying to do something and everything is
[16:08] just blocking it off
[16:09] on both sides they say it might not be
[16:13] the will of the lord see now
[16:16] don't let the devil lie to you like that
[16:19] the first thing is find out whether it's
[16:22] the will of god
[16:23] or not it's not when there are
[16:26] obstacles it means not the will of god
[16:29] not necessary
[16:30] and when and then if you want to know
[16:33] whether it's the will of
[16:35] god look into the bible
[16:38] look into the word and find out because
[16:41] he will never
[16:42] contradict the word if he's the will of
[16:45] god
[16:46] there is the thing that this that sets
[16:50] you straight is the word of god and then
[16:53] if
[16:53] you see it's in the word of god for you
[16:56] to do it
[16:56] do it amen
[17:01] ah actually but continues
[17:04] like for instance seeking for the bodies
[17:06] of the holy ghost
[17:08] many times i've run into people say well
[17:11] i have sought for the holy ghost and i
[17:13] just could not receive it i don't
[17:15] believe it's for me
[17:18] every time i get down i i get sick
[17:22] and i go to praying if i fast i
[17:26] get sick and if i try to stay all night
[17:29] i stay
[17:30] i stay up i get so sleepy
[17:34] you know that's a good medicine when you
[17:37] say you don't
[17:38] sleep at night just try
[17:41] to pray you're gonna sleep
[17:45] i get i i can't get off my feet remember
[17:48] that is the devil because
[17:50] god intends you to do to have the
[17:54] holy ghost it's for whosoever
[17:58] will amen
[18:01] so we have laid out um
[18:05] romans chapter 7 to see the
[18:08] battle that is taking place and
[18:11] will take place until we leave this
[18:14] world
[18:15] it will be there so let's be prepared
[18:20] let's have a strategy if i can say that
[18:23] amen
[18:24] so this barrier called
[18:29] a human spirit
[18:32] i don't want to say that the human
[18:33] spirit is not good it's actually good
[18:37] because if you don't have it if he
[18:40] leaves you
[18:41] dead
[18:45] if a baby is born
[18:49] and that spirit is not in that baby
[18:53] that baby is still born
[18:57] therefore we have so many stillborn
[19:00] babies
[19:01] in churches because the spirit did not
[19:05] get in
[19:07] so this human spirit that i'm talking
[19:10] about
[19:11] is not a bad thing
[19:15] is what gives us to become
[19:18] a living soul because this is a human
[19:22] spirit that
[19:22] comes from the lord however
[19:28] it's uh not subject
[19:31] to god to his word
[19:35] and our prayers are effort when we
[19:38] listen to the word and we pray
[19:41] is to subject it to the word
[19:46] so what about him explain to us
[19:50] that spirit you know
[19:57] 1963 the flashing rate of this
[20:01] sign of is coming the moment when a
[20:04] mother is fixing to have a baby you
[20:06] notice
[20:08] you don't care how cruel she has been
[20:10] and how
[20:11] mean you know a while before that baby
[20:15] is born the mother gets gentle why is it
[20:18] when them little muscles in that womb
[20:22] is preaching and jumping like that there
[20:25] is a
[20:25] heavenly body waiting for it
[20:29] so brother branham call it the heavenly
[20:32] body
[20:33] but that's the human spirit
[20:36] but is it is the body is a spirit
[20:41] that was predestinated for you
[20:45] and when it comes from the mother the
[20:47] doctor or the
[20:48] midwife whoever it has to pick it up and
[20:52] shook it and spank it
[20:56] shake it and something and then it
[20:58] catches the breath of
[20:59] life and the the little angelic spirit
[21:03] comes into it the breath of life and he
[21:07] becomes
[21:08] a living soul
[21:11] and brother now compared to the
[21:15] the uh the holy ghost when it comes to a
[21:18] human being
[21:19] and he say and when we have christ in
[21:21] our heart
[21:22] and christ becomes real in our heart
[21:25] it's a little baby if
[21:28] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[21:33] then you have another one that one is
[21:36] different amen
[21:40] when this life if you have received
[21:43] christ
[21:44] in your life and this life we're living
[21:46] in now
[21:47] is resolved dissolve you have another
[21:51] one
[21:52] but the spirit you will get on the other
[21:55] side
[21:55] will be different from this spirit we
[21:59] have
[22:00] here today amen
[22:04] continuing uh with
[22:09] kind of laying down laying up
[22:12] laying down the uh kind of for that
[22:14] foundation
[22:16] but that's our subject tonight
[22:20] yeah um 1964
[22:23] questions answered number four now while
[22:26] this
[22:27] little body is being formed little
[22:29] natural body being
[22:31] formed in the mother there is a
[22:33] spiritual
[22:34] body of the earth
[22:37] now you see is it heavenly
[22:41] spiritual body but is of the earth
[22:44] to receive this natural body as soon as
[22:47] it's
[22:47] born now the baby is born with
[22:51] live muscles and beating heart but
[22:55] no breath of life in it it's it's
[22:58] muscle twitching see then see if
[23:01] there was something different from that
[23:04] if there wasn't a spirit that had to
[23:07] come
[23:08] into it later then our breath could
[23:11] leave us and we would breathe no more
[23:14] and still be alive but when this body
[23:17] doesn't
[23:18] receive oxygen from uh or breath
[23:22] in taken out outtake uh
[23:25] of our lungs then we are dead
[23:28] so therefore we thank god for giving us
[23:32] the spirit amen it is important
[23:36] it keeps us alive um
[23:39] if a man when a man when it leaves a man
[23:43] the man dies that's what i wrote down
[23:47] when it leaves a man the man
[23:50] dies so it's good
[23:54] it's important for us to carry it
[23:58] but it's a spirit that fights
[24:02] the word of god it's a spirit that
[24:05] can carry on it evil
[24:09] a spirit too
[24:12] ah it's a spirit that you know is a
[24:15] wonderer spirit sometimes
[24:19] that the prophet has to uh
[24:22] to say okay we want to start this
[24:26] church we want to start prayer
[24:30] i have to take all the spirits under my
[24:32] control
[24:34] for the glory of god
[24:38] then it's you see is uh
[24:42] when they wan it's wanderer
[24:45] it's kind of if it's out of uh
[24:49] order it's kind of bothering the
[24:52] the prophet like he has to fight to pray
[24:56] for the sick
[24:57] for to have the discernment
[25:00] and that's what we want tonight and
[25:03] is to get this spirit to be sub
[25:08] subject to the lord amen amen
[25:14] now as i say here
[25:17] that when he leaves a man he dies
[25:21] it means that spirit goes back somewhere
[25:25] he was given to us so we can live in
[25:28] this life
[25:30] and when he leaves us it goes somewhere
[25:33] bharapanam talks about
[25:34] an experience in a message
[25:38] called the angel of god
[25:41] you may know the story he said this
[25:44] and the doctors knew he was dead
[25:48] this is a brother named
[25:51] elijah he was dead the doctor say
[25:55] okay he's dead now we're waiting for
[25:57] somebody to come and
[25:59] bring him to the funeral home or
[26:02] something
[26:03] and he say i want to offer sympathy to
[26:06] the family and starting out
[26:08] of the house the wife seemingly
[26:11] crying of the man and as i started
[26:15] out the door a human hand seemingly
[26:18] touched me by the arm the man is dead
[26:22] brother branham goes to comfort the
[26:25] family now he finish
[26:28] he's now leaving he want to go home
[26:32] a hand stops him don't go
[26:36] and i felt it to hold i i felt
[26:40] it hold me and as i started forward
[26:44] i could not move when i turned back
[26:47] the hand left me i went to the
[26:50] bedside and looked down
[26:54] upon the man there was a methodist
[26:57] minister's
[26:57] wife in the room and another sister and
[27:00] i start
[27:01] to have prayer so brother brahm is
[27:04] praying for this man
[27:06] this is what happened why i put this um
[27:11] and when i come to myself brother
[27:13] bernami is lost in
[27:15] prayer and i was laying on this man body
[27:19] the dead man had a over his
[27:22] face for at least half an hour
[27:27] my face was laying right against him and
[27:29] i was
[27:30] calling out into the spirit land
[27:34] there is a land called a spirit land
[27:37] where our spirits come from right and i
[27:40] was
[27:41] calling out into the spirit land brother
[27:44] elijah
[27:45] his name was elijah brother elijah
[27:47] calling out
[27:48] into the land of his spirit not knowing
[27:51] what
[27:52] i was doing in a few moments i
[27:56] i laid still calling i felt the man's
[27:59] hand coming up around my ears the man is
[28:03] working on the pennsylvania railroad
[28:05] tonight alive
[28:09] amen he called
[28:12] him from the land of the spirit
[28:17] he had god is
[28:20] using the prophet to even
[28:24] go into where the our spirit
[28:27] comes from and calling it
[28:31] calling it back to this life
[28:34] this is not the thing that
[28:38] is that
[28:41] is going to was not brother branham
[28:45] just giving us the premise
[28:50] of what the bride will do
[28:55] because the words say that we are the
[28:57] final voice
[29:00] it means the word the denominations
[29:03] don't have the word
[29:05] anymore god can use them they are not
[29:07] the
[29:08] mouthpiece of god
[29:11] we are the mouthpiece but literally can
[29:14] we also be that voice that
[29:18] calling the other churches to come
[29:21] into resurrection how could brother
[29:24] branham
[29:25] called elijah come and
[29:28] go search for him in the dead
[29:32] and bring him here
[29:36] and we can see it in the message
[29:39] uh the rapture 65
[29:46] now it's the first thing is
[29:49] this sounding the first thing is the
[29:52] trumpet in the voice and the shout and
[29:54] then a voice and then
[29:56] a trumpet shout a messenger getting the
[29:59] people
[30:00] ready the second is the voice
[30:04] of the resurrection the same voice that
[30:08] a loud voice in john 11
[30:12] 39 and 44 that called lazarus from the
[30:15] grave
[30:16] so i don't know about this i was looking
[30:19] at it and i
[30:20] say you know
[30:23] that voice that
[30:26] calling the dead to life
[30:29] was in the brother permit was it just
[30:31] for brother branham
[30:34] was it just for verbum to amuse
[30:37] us how can a moral calling other models
[30:42] to life
[30:43] could that be that we will call the
[30:47] other
[30:47] ages back to life because his
[30:50] voice is in us the same voice that
[30:54] called
[30:54] lazarus come to life
[30:59] will that be that same voice we within
[31:03] us my if that
[31:07] is the case sir
[31:10] what a responsibility
[31:14] giving life all the seven church
[31:17] ages that went to sleep are waiting for
[31:20] us to call them back
[31:25] my what a responsibility
[31:32] and to look forward to that day amen
[31:36] and it is already here because
[31:39] all these things are in the world it's
[31:42] the word that will call
[31:44] the dead to come
[31:48] and it's that word that need to
[31:51] be to take this spirit our spirit
[31:55] into subjection i want to insist on this
[31:59] because it's
[32:00] very very important we have received a
[32:04] human spirit
[32:06] that is of the world is colonel
[32:10] it doesn't obey to god it's like a fence
[32:14] when
[32:14] god wants to do something to you when
[32:17] god wants to do something good to you
[32:20] it's he has to go over the fence
[32:24] to bless you because of the human spirit
[32:28] resist god it's like a
[32:32] fence is is a problem and you can see
[32:35] it in brother branham's life it's it's
[32:38] like
[32:39] a fence now when he goes to preach to
[32:43] people
[32:44] first of all just when he opens his
[32:48] mouth
[32:49] people already know
[32:52] his grammar is not good his
[32:56] vocabulary the way he builds his verbs
[32:58] and the
[32:59] nouns you know then he
[33:02] he knows this and he start
[33:06] by addressing the human spirit
[33:09] because it's a barrier to receiving the
[33:13] word because the word does not
[33:14] go straight from the preacher
[33:19] to your soul it goes to your natural
[33:23] ears he goes to your natural spirit
[33:27] before you get to your soul
[33:30] therefore the prophet knowing that
[33:34] he has to prepare the people because a
[33:37] spirit that is not
[33:39] prepared is not ready to receive god
[33:43] and brother say that even this your
[33:46] spirit
[33:47] can get that's all the spirit cannot
[33:50] get along with you how can it
[33:54] get along with god so therefore
[33:58] verbum will try to help the people
[34:02] okay he will say to them for example
[34:06] i'm not educated but i have a message
[34:10] amen i'm not against the nomination i
[34:14] know maybe
[34:15] they heard that this man speaks against
[34:18] the nomination
[34:19] is already a barrier
[34:22] that barrier will not let them receive
[34:26] what god has for them that day
[34:29] so he's going to address that i'm not
[34:32] against your denomination they're good
[34:35] but i'm against the system of
[34:38] denomination
[34:40] i have friends in all the nominations
[34:44] i will tell them that i have a message
[34:47] god send an angel for me
[34:51] if i don't stay true to that message i
[34:54] will be a hypocrite
[34:56] you may disagree with me but
[34:59] we still brothers what is doing
[35:03] is working to
[35:06] to bypass to go over that
[35:09] fence that barrier
[35:14] amen
[35:17] and then he will he will now bring the
[35:20] people
[35:21] to listen to him now is the
[35:25] anti-zoo is a kentuckian language is not
[35:28] the problem anymore
[35:30] now they can listen to him they have
[35:33] they
[35:34] he has just bypassed that barrier
[35:39] and he i'm not talking history now day
[35:44] by day god
[35:45] wants to talk to us we hear the message
[35:48] every time we come
[35:49] wednesday sunday but what barrier can
[35:53] that
[35:54] be the human spirit can
[35:58] not allow us to fully
[36:01] benefit from what we hear day in day out
[36:06] by god's grace we want to pray and look
[36:08] at ourselves and say
[36:10] god help me because i cannot
[36:13] say that me since i have the holy ghost
[36:18] i don't have the human nature it's still
[36:21] there
[36:21] it has the sticky nature of the
[36:25] bird therefore what hinders
[36:29] me to receive the plain
[36:33] bene benefits of the word of god i'm
[36:37] hearing
[36:38] every day there must be something god
[36:41] help me
[36:42] because that nature is there is a sticky
[36:46] nature
[36:47] it will continue until we leave this
[36:49] world
[36:50] is that right
[36:54] let's just continue now here is the
[36:58] brother brand i'm talking to them
[37:00] in the message from that time on
[37:04] from that time in 1962
[37:07] here is preparing them now now i'm not
[37:11] the preacher
[37:13] his brother but i'm not the preacher
[37:16] you know i'm not i have
[37:19] not the education to do it
[37:23] to become a preacher you have to be
[37:25] educated
[37:27] was peter educated
[37:31] but he was a preacher right but he
[37:34] is going along with the human spirit
[37:38] well let me agree with them that i'm not
[37:41] a preacher
[37:43] maybe they will you know they will
[37:45] listen to me now
[37:47] but you know i already told them i'm not
[37:52] a teacher because i'm not educated i'm
[37:54] not this i'm not this
[37:56] and then sometimes oh you know sometimes
[37:59] i feel reluctant standing here by men of
[38:03] god
[38:03] who's called to the office please
[38:07] brother branham
[38:10] they are apostle prophets teachers
[38:13] pastors and evangelists not all our
[38:17] apostles not all our prophets not all
[38:20] our teachers
[38:22] not all evangelists i'm standing here
[38:25] now
[38:26] he's trying to show them i'm not a
[38:28] preacher
[38:29] i'm just a little little guy
[38:34] he's preparing his healing he is
[38:38] trying to look at the human spirit it
[38:41] could be a barrier for the word of god
[38:44] to be
[38:44] planted therefore
[38:48] speak to them prepare them
[38:51] and then hopefully there will be some
[38:53] that can now
[38:54] listen to the world
[38:58] now he will start talking about his
[39:01] ministry say
[39:02] but my ministry and i i know this
[39:05] i know it because i listen to many
[39:08] messages and
[39:09] you know it you say they are apostles
[39:13] they are doctors they
[39:14] this they're that i am not one of them
[39:18] and me my ministry i say yeah is going
[39:21] to say
[39:22] my ministry is to pray for the sick
[39:26] really really and i'll say 1933
[39:30] when he re when that voice come came
[39:33] on the ohio river was it to pray for the
[39:36] sec
[39:37] now is he going to say that that yeah
[39:40] you know what my ministry is to pray for
[39:43] the sec
[39:46] i'm listening it was sunday i was coming
[39:48] to church
[39:49] and i would put the tape and we come
[39:51] with the family and
[39:53] i'm i'm listening i i'm just prepared is
[39:56] going to say
[39:57] my ministry is to pray for the sake
[40:02] then uh but we say
[40:05] but my ministry is now different
[40:06] minister from a pastor teacher i am not
[40:09] i
[40:10] i i say think wrong again
[40:13] forgive me i don't mean it but this is
[40:16] my ministry
[40:17] to declare him that is
[40:20] here whoa this is good
[40:24] this is good because brother brethren
[40:25] you cannot be too humble
[40:27] because if you're too humble then we
[40:29] will miss something like this
[40:32] my menace is to declare him that he
[40:35] is here that's our ministry too
[40:39] that's your ministry to declare him
[40:43] amen amen
[40:47] my the spirit of human spirit is
[40:53] such a barrier i don't know
[40:56] when we were in heaven you
[40:59] have asked a good spirit god gave you a
[41:03] sweet spirit
[41:05] but no matter what's
[41:08] how sweet the spirit is is still
[41:11] need god it still needs
[41:15] the word because it's a natural it's a
[41:19] carnal spirit
[41:20] no matter what it is we it is
[41:23] always a resist god-perfect will
[41:30] let's go to a question and answer
[41:34] 64 0a
[41:39] brother branham here
[41:43] let me set a little bit stage
[41:47] here it's the same thing
[41:50] that brother branham is trying to help
[41:53] someone
[41:55] who has a an issue
[41:59] but being a prophet you can see what the
[42:02] problem is
[42:05] it's still the human spirit
[42:08] so he's going to help him now you will
[42:12] say
[42:13] but brother branham is not here tonight
[42:17] i'll say the word is here tonight
[42:22] so the word will discern the issue that
[42:26] you have
[42:27] what are you struggling with but
[42:30] ask god the grace that when the word
[42:34] comes
[42:35] the face and the barrier that you have
[42:37] will not go against it
[42:39] because he speaks still
[42:42] small voice every day wednesday
[42:46] sunday be very careful
[42:49] let us be so real and ask god for that
[42:52] grace
[42:54] because it's so god
[42:57] speaks to us daily
[43:00] it's amazing what god does sometimes
[43:05] oh my
[43:08] now he says now
[43:12] in this speaking tongues and so forth
[43:15] i wished everyone of you
[43:18] spoke in tongues i should do and many
[43:21] times
[43:22] good christians and you see if i tell
[43:25] you that
[43:26] was on the program i found someone not
[43:29] program excuse me on the interview this
[43:31] morning
[43:32] a person i i guess they're still
[43:36] here in the building that about speaking
[43:39] with tongue the person is
[43:41] genuine person and they're real person
[43:43] they
[43:44] lived right and they've they've heard
[43:48] me say that the evidence of the holy
[43:51] ghost was not
[43:52] speaking in tongues and it's not
[43:55] but i advise that person to ask
[43:58] god to let them either speak in tongues
[44:01] or prophesy
[44:03] because of its the nature
[44:09] brother branham constantly say
[44:12] speaking in tongues is not the evidence
[44:17] it's not the evidence you have the holy
[44:19] ghost but he turned around and said to a
[44:21] person
[44:22] after looking at the person and say for
[44:25] you
[44:25] because of your human nature which is
[44:29] such a barrier for you
[44:32] ask a god so you can speak in tongues
[44:38] and then when you speak in tongues then
[44:41] that barrier
[44:42] that now the word will go over
[44:46] because he has satisfied a human
[44:50] you know desire and then
[44:54] it can now allow the word of god to go
[44:57] through
[45:00] my no but when i'm saying
[45:04] that the first thing i went to that
[45:07] person
[45:08] found their birth place
[45:11] amen i found them where they're born
[45:15] has an impact on you on the human spirit
[45:19] and that sign they were born under
[45:22] the star the day you were born
[45:26] influenced your human spirit and
[45:29] could tell what the birth was i couldn't
[45:32] even say
[45:32] when they were born which
[45:35] way is set in the natural
[45:39] natural nature set them in a
[45:42] certain line wow
[45:45] then when they're reborn again they're
[45:48] over here in another nature
[45:53] and then when you find into this nature
[45:56] that
[45:57] the inside the conscience that's the
[46:00] soul
[46:03] inside consider the outside conscience
[46:05] that the spirit
[46:06] human spirit moves you in one way
[46:10] that's your natural birth
[46:13] then they will make up something and
[46:16] it's
[46:17] put them what under if put them
[46:20] in a split condition they don't know
[46:22] what to do
[46:23] they will say the lord wants me to do
[46:25] this right when i'm keep
[46:27] talking about other things here but
[46:30] you see the prophet
[46:34] is a revealer of the word
[46:38] of god written in the bible
[46:42] the prophet is a revealer of the word of
[46:46] god
[46:47] written in the zodiac
[46:50] the prophet is the revealer of the word
[46:52] of god written in the pyramid
[46:56] is written in the bible you don't know
[46:57] what he's talking about
[46:59] it's a revealer of the word written in
[47:03] his own life
[47:05] he can see what is written in the zodiac
[47:09] for a person
[47:11] and he can tell that person to overcome
[47:14] the human spirit
[47:16] you do this you
[47:19] ask for god to give you
[47:22] speaking in tongues brother branham is
[47:25] not
[47:26] here the same word is here
[47:30] you also can go to your knees and
[47:33] you know what bother you i preached the
[47:36] message for very long time
[47:39] and sometimes we don't give credit to
[47:41] the believers
[47:42] they actually all know what is bothering
[47:45] them
[47:46] when they say this is my weakness they
[47:50] saying the truth and i i i started
[47:53] ministering or
[47:54] some years later i used to tell people
[47:57] when they tell me that i say no
[47:59] uh you okay no no no there is nothing
[48:02] wrong
[48:03] these people are spiritual
[48:07] they know what is bothering them
[48:10] since you know the same god who spoke to
[48:13] this man
[48:15] can speak also to you
[48:18] if you take time and you are sincere you
[48:21] are real
[48:23] god can speak to you
[48:26] and because of your nature he can say to
[48:30] you because of your nature i want you to
[48:32] separate from
[48:33] certain friends for example are you with
[48:36] me
[48:37] yeah you can do that because he knows
[48:39] your nature
[48:40] you can come to church and the pastor
[48:42] will heed it right
[48:44] and you will know god just told me to
[48:46] stop this
[48:48] to stop that because he knows my nature
[48:51] we are not we don't all have the same
[48:54] nature
[48:57] we very different different
[48:58] personalities and things
[49:02] but yet the world has to have an impact
[49:05] in our life
[49:06] the world must have an impact in our
[49:09] life
[49:09] what stops it sometimes it is our
[49:13] human nature
[49:16] that's right
[49:22] the human nature already say oh i know
[49:25] that
[49:26] this preacher is talking about me
[49:29] i'm not talking about that but
[49:32] it's already talking about me it's
[49:34] already a barrier
[49:37] right yeah is so judgmental
[49:40] it's already buried sometimes the
[49:42] prophet will say
[49:44] the devil is telling you to dis to
[49:48] to not to believe me to doubt to me
[49:53] he can hear it you can hear the spirit
[49:55] speaking
[49:57] i can tell people don't do that don't do
[49:59] that
[50:00] all right but it's not here but the word
[50:04] is here the same yesterday today and
[50:07] forever
[50:08] it's here
[50:12] we let opportunity pass us
[50:15] by it's time we
[50:19] go to our next amen god help me
[50:24] because this group mentality should not
[50:27] be among us
[50:29] we are not jews the jewish people is
[50:33] safe as a nation
[50:35] we are safe as individuals
[50:39] right it's a personal walk we cannot
[50:42] even
[50:42] copy other churches other brothers and
[50:45] sisters in our church
[50:47] and if we we cannot be like that
[50:51] and god you won't find favors with god
[50:55] by
[50:55] following what everybody is doing
[51:06] i hope you you agree with me
[51:10] you will shake my hand after service
[51:13] okay
[51:14] all right question and answer number
[51:18] three
[51:21] and explain the same thing i'll just
[51:24] keep going
[51:27] so you see the prophet
[51:30] is the revealer of a written word
[51:35] the word is even written in his own life
[51:38] you can see where you were born this
[51:41] zodiac
[51:42] but that same word is here amen
[51:46] it's here amen
[51:50] how we need we need to stop that
[51:52] wanderer
[51:53] spirit and keep it a little bit
[51:56] like peter and john say hey
[52:00] look at us because this with so much
[52:04] destruction but you know fix
[52:07] the they want to contact the spirit
[52:10] this is a human spirit is wondering
[52:15] look at us okay pay attention now
[52:18] you see okay we don't have a gold
[52:21] look-up pocket it's not gold okay
[52:26] no silver either but we have something
[52:29] right what what do you have ah they
[52:32] contact the spirit now
[52:34] now what we have is jesus christ
[52:37] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[52:39] stand up
[52:46] god is the same today
[52:50] too now
[52:53] in the message god being misunderstood
[52:57] the way a portion of questions and
[52:59] answers in that message
[53:02] brother branham i'm saved and have been
[53:05] baptized
[53:07] in the name of jesus christ
[53:11] but how do i get away from a stubborn
[53:14] spirit that
[53:15] i can't seem to break away from
[53:19] a brother like you and i saved
[53:23] yeah well my christian brother and
[53:27] sister
[53:28] whoever it may be now most times when
[53:32] you find people that got stabbed in
[53:35] spirit
[53:35] it's usually a complex that causes this
[53:39] it's personality
[53:42] either they have inherited from a mother
[53:45] father
[53:46] uncle aunt grandmother
[53:49] grandfather somebody like that and
[53:52] if you trace it back down through your
[53:56] life you will find
[53:59] as a prophet revere
[54:03] of the word of god i'm going to insist
[54:08] the word is here
[54:12] so we cannot be like oh if brother
[54:14] brother was here
[54:18] i know if barbara was here we will all
[54:20] be in
[54:21] jeffersonville the real
[54:24] estate market in jeffersonville to the
[54:27] roof
[54:30] they will say why we have so many people
[54:32] here
[54:33] when you go there you find
[54:37] everybody goes to that uh store that
[54:40] sells candies you know
[54:44] salvation in a candy a sister say that
[54:46] was not me a sister say that
[54:50] so we will all go there
[54:54] oh my that's why god took him
[54:58] i was telling the church one day i said
[55:00] i said the church
[55:02] we killed brother branham
[55:05] because everything will be brought upon
[55:07] him can you tell me where my keys
[55:09] are i lost my keys
[55:15] may god say take him because if i don't
[55:18] take
[55:19] him they won't read the message
[55:22] for themselves they won't listen so i
[55:25] gotta take him so
[55:26] i make them guilty we killed brother
[55:29] brennan
[55:30] sorry but you get the
[55:33] the idea now
[55:36] now i've taken this by experience we're
[55:40] talking about
[55:41] a stubborn spirit now i've taken this by
[55:44] experience under discernment because
[55:46] i've met cases on the platform thousands
[55:49] of those
[55:50] that had that spirit and the first thing
[55:52] you know
[55:53] how chase that split right back by
[55:56] discernment and finally
[55:57] was a granddaddy there was
[56:00] a grandmother jeans too
[56:04] jeans and there was somebody else back
[56:07] down there and
[56:08] you inherit inherit that by nature
[56:14] and very say stubborn stubbornness is
[56:17] not of god
[56:19] and now the only way to get away from is
[56:23] that is you have to have faith to
[56:25] overcome that
[56:27] you are a christian you you are a son
[56:31] or daughter of god whichever you may be
[56:34] and you will never be able
[56:35] just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke
[56:38] it and rebuke it
[56:39] you see brother bottom is telling you
[56:41] what to do because this person went to
[56:45] ask
[56:45] now brother branham is not there at the
[56:48] word still
[56:49] god is still alive i don't even
[56:53] when i read this i don't even know what
[56:55] this person is saying what is that
[56:57] stubbornness
[56:59] i don't understand what i mean
[57:02] but what about him got it right the word
[57:05] knows exactly how you feel
[57:07] the word knows what bothers you
[57:12] no he said it's just like a tantalizing
[57:15] uh
[57:16] a rare snake he's lying there
[57:19] ready to bite you if you just ignore
[57:22] him and walk away for him from
[57:26] him it can't hurt you
[57:30] i had used this in other things
[57:34] when the devil speaks to my mind
[57:37] i decided to ignore him
[57:41] it works yes
[57:46] just ignore him you're not a christian
[57:48] i'm a christian
[57:49] i'm going to church
[57:52] that's it you dissident no
[57:57] ignore him even when he convinced
[58:01] your mind you still ignore him because
[58:04] you're not just this you are that
[58:15] so when you feel that you got a stubborn
[58:18] spirit
[58:19] lay the thing on the altar and believe
[58:21] god
[58:22] that the thing is dead and you will
[58:24] never have it
[58:25] no more and go on don't even pay
[58:28] attention any attention to it
[58:30] no more and the thing will leave you
[58:33] people want to feel like
[58:34] okay is it gone he said no ignore it
[58:41] resist the devil and he will flee from
[58:44] you
[58:45] that get away quickly so that
[58:48] would be my advice how to overcome it
[58:52] we overcome the devil by faith that's
[58:55] why we overcome all evil is by faith
[58:58] you believe but you don't test it with
[59:02] your mind
[59:04] you don't test it with your reasoning
[59:06] because is
[59:07] of the this nature is not good
[59:12] because it's just like you are telling
[59:14] the devil do you agree that
[59:16] now i'm delivered from that thing
[59:20] he will never say yes
[59:25] [Music]
[59:31] church is a barrier i wrote down
[59:34] him in my note barrier to sincerity
[59:40] god values sincerity
[59:43] the prophet told us sincerity alone
[59:47] does not save you but when you have the
[59:50] word
[59:52] when you have the responsibility that we
[59:54] have
[59:56] adding sincerity is critical
[59:59] amen a few
[1:00:04] few weeks ago
[1:00:07] i decided to to fast
[1:00:11] and god knew that i decided to fast
[1:00:15] because i'm listening to
[1:00:18] something there you say okay
[1:00:21] it's like butterburner is being told
[1:00:24] um when you fast this time when you fast
[1:00:28] be more sincere wow
[1:00:32] so god knows that i'm fasting
[1:00:36] is using the same thing they told
[1:00:39] brother branham
[1:00:41] and they say be more sincere but
[1:00:44] sometimes words for me
[1:00:45] you know you know you know better with
[1:00:48] me but
[1:00:48] the word sincerity what that means
[1:00:52] you know what is it
[1:00:55] because if i go to the dictionary
[1:01:00] i can look for something that is
[1:01:02] opposite
[1:01:03] of sincerity so i can understand
[1:01:06] sincerity
[1:01:07] and when i go to that it didn't work
[1:01:11] because when buddha program was told by
[1:01:14] god
[1:01:15] that you have one a gift
[1:01:18] you will take somebody's hand
[1:01:22] and you will see the sickness on that
[1:01:24] person
[1:01:25] and you say if you are humble and
[1:01:28] sincere
[1:01:29] and i found that if the country of
[1:01:32] sincerity
[1:01:34] uh is a hypocrisy
[1:01:38] is it what he was telling him if you are
[1:01:40] less hypocrite now
[1:01:44] he didn't work for me so he didn't work
[1:01:47] for me
[1:01:50] but because the time is
[1:01:53] kind of flying so i didn't realize
[1:01:57] but
[1:02:01] so i realized it was not that
[1:02:05] sincerity is about the intensity that
[1:02:08] you doing things how real
[1:02:13] you are is it just
[1:02:17] formality to comply
[1:02:21] then that's not it so
[1:02:24] the contrary of sincerity
[1:02:27] in this case was to be more
[1:02:32] passionate about what you do to be more
[1:02:36] real it was not to tell brother branham
[1:02:40] you've been hypocrite now you've been
[1:02:42] fake
[1:02:43] uh now you need to be more
[1:02:47] less fake and uh no
[1:02:50] it's deeper than that as you reading the
[1:02:54] message
[1:02:55] you find out that's the primary
[1:02:58] definition of sincerity is
[1:03:00] this one but the the real one that
[1:03:04] it is it's more about how it
[1:03:07] approaches god how at the the
[1:03:10] level of your devotion
[1:03:14] that's sincerity because you can just
[1:03:17] do it because i have to do it
[1:03:20] but you got to be more sincere than that
[1:03:26] sometimes is
[1:03:29] sincerity versus dullness dullness
[1:03:33] you're not really interested you have no
[1:03:37] real enthusiasm about it
[1:03:41] sincerely like do you mean
[1:03:44] business yeah
[1:03:49] it's not like the the parable of the
[1:03:51] investment
[1:03:53] when a man say to god you know god
[1:03:56] the boss give them money to invest one
[1:03:59] of them doesn't
[1:04:00] invest then you say anyway i know
[1:04:04] you you take what doesn't belong to you
[1:04:08] even if i don't invest it you'll be okay
[1:04:12] you know god will take care of
[1:04:15] everything everything is just in god's
[1:04:18] plan
[1:04:20] let's go to bed sleep because it will
[1:04:23] happen anyway
[1:04:31] sincerities i mean business i
[1:04:34] mean it and god loves that
[1:04:38] you get favors from from the lord when
[1:04:42] you do this
[1:04:44] yes brother favors from the lord i
[1:04:47] i receive everything by grace
[1:04:50] yes i am the
[1:04:54] greatest beneficiary of grace
[1:04:58] you should say that the same amen too
[1:05:02] but that doesn't does not stop it
[1:05:05] you know i was not
[1:05:08] read because the time is just flying
[1:05:12] but we always
[1:05:15] talk about sister ahati right
[1:05:18] we always say she say the right thing
[1:05:22] but sometimes we don't talk about before
[1:05:26] she say the right thing what was going
[1:05:29] on in her life for example
[1:05:32] we can see that the church was a
[1:05:35] building
[1:05:36] they're building a new place they they
[1:05:38] want to build a new building
[1:05:40] if i can say that and then since hearty
[1:05:43] ride
[1:05:43] took five she took uh
[1:05:47] 50 dollars to give
[1:05:50] for the building and the deacons or the
[1:05:54] trustees say no no sister
[1:05:55] you cannot do that this is six months of
[1:05:58] your salary how can we do this
[1:06:00] she he she forced she ended up
[1:06:04] giving twenty dollars it's still a lot
[1:06:06] like
[1:06:07] two months of her salary she gave it for
[1:06:10] the building and
[1:06:11] and when brother brown heard it he had
[1:06:14] money in his
[1:06:14] pocket he want to give her back
[1:06:18] that money and when he tried to give to
[1:06:22] her
[1:06:22] god said don't you do that
[1:06:27] but that night she said the right thing
[1:06:32] we don't talk about that he was real
[1:06:35] that's sincerity
[1:06:39] god is moved but that that
[1:06:42] real life god is moved by it
[1:06:47] but when we do things in the group
[1:06:52] how can you obtain favor by just
[1:06:55] following the group i'm not saying
[1:06:56] following what the other people do is
[1:06:59] necessarily wrong
[1:07:00] but usually we find that is we taking
[1:07:04] other people's spirit on ourselves
[1:07:10] instead of the holy ghost we taking
[1:07:12] other people's spirits
[1:07:14] on ourselves and we don't have favors
[1:07:17] with god
[1:07:18] i found out everything many things that
[1:07:21] we hear
[1:07:22] by the pronoun third pool this happened
[1:07:25] that happened
[1:07:27] before that happened it is always
[1:07:29] something
[1:07:30] and when you watch it it's people being
[1:07:33] more
[1:07:34] real in the devotion passionate
[1:07:37] about god then god does it
[1:07:41] look at brother woods bank woods and his
[1:07:44] brother
[1:07:45] lyle we know that brother branham
[1:07:50] called to life a fish is that right
[1:07:53] but do you know what happened before he
[1:07:56] does that
[1:07:57] they were talking they say when we were
[1:08:00] younger
[1:08:02] we used to visit a woman nearby
[1:08:05] she must be old now in her 90s but when
[1:08:08] we were younger
[1:08:10] she will give us bread with butter
[1:08:14] it was delicious we ate it and she spoke
[1:08:17] to
[1:08:18] us about jesus we ate the bread but we
[1:08:20] didn't
[1:08:21] take the word but she kept doing this
[1:08:25] but now we are christians
[1:08:28] we need to go tell her that we are now
[1:08:31] christians
[1:08:33] god was a move by this
[1:08:37] thankfulness but this
[1:08:40] you know love to appreciation of
[1:08:44] the work that woman did she did not see
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:48] fruits but the fruit were following and
[1:08:51] when they say it
[1:08:53] brother heard the voice telling him
[1:08:56] stand up and speak and he spoke and said
[1:09:01] a little animal will be raised to death
[1:09:05] and from death a little animal will be
[1:09:08] raised
[1:09:09] what we hear that a little fish was
[1:09:12] brought back to life but what was the
[1:09:14] story behind
[1:09:16] the story behind it was a real christian
[1:09:19] life seriousness with god
[1:09:24] god help us i i i was even
[1:09:28] thinking about sister media i
[1:09:31] i listened to a biography about her but
[1:09:34] the the reality
[1:09:35] is yes she was predestined to be married
[1:09:39] to the prophet
[1:09:40] yes you are protested to to a lot of
[1:09:43] things yes you have this god will
[1:09:47] fulfill his will in you but
[1:09:50] you know israel god had
[1:09:53] them to go to the promised land
[1:09:56] in four days they ended up not
[1:10:00] going after 40 years
[1:10:04] eventually they got there but that was
[1:10:08] not the way god wanted
[1:10:10] i look at sister media she was about 12
[1:10:13] years old
[1:10:15] she's a she she she was
[1:10:18] at the uh the river ohio river
[1:10:22] when the angel came down and
[1:10:25] brother branham say close the eyes
[1:10:30] she listened to what her pastor said
[1:10:34] she closed her eyes
[1:10:38] when other people will say well i have
[1:10:41] my opinion the pastor can say this i
[1:10:43] have my opinion you know this is america
[1:10:45] brother
[1:10:49] yeah but she
[1:10:53] when the time came for her
[1:10:56] marriage came she brother balaam didn't
[1:10:59] want to get
[1:11:00] remarried and he
[1:11:04] opposed it in different ways but she
[1:11:07] went and asked
[1:11:08] god she said god speak to me through
[1:11:10] your bible
[1:11:12] the urim team
[1:11:16] you know when she opened the bible she
[1:11:19] saw
[1:11:20] that i will send you malacca i will send
[1:11:23] you elijah the prophet
[1:11:25] in malachi 4
[1:11:28] was not that what she heard on the river
[1:11:31] that day
[1:11:33] was not that voice
[1:11:36] spoke when she closed her eyes other
[1:11:39] people did not close their eyes
[1:11:41] so they did not hear the voice they saw
[1:11:43] the light
[1:11:44] they didn't hear the voice because she
[1:11:47] obeyed
[1:11:48] what the pastor told her she closed her
[1:11:50] eyes
[1:11:51] she heard of the the message saying that
[1:11:55] as john the baptist was saying i'm
[1:11:58] sending you with the message for the
[1:12:00] second coming of christ
[1:12:02] so when he reads it at first she could
[1:12:05] not
[1:12:06] understand she read it she saw that
[1:12:09] yes that same voice that spoke to me
[1:12:13] in ohio river that is in the bible so i
[1:12:16] will marry
[1:12:17] whatever
[1:12:20] it's all over the place
[1:12:25] maybe we have wrong understanding
[1:12:29] of the grace of god
[1:12:32] god wants every christian to be real
[1:12:37] he wants you to say search me
[1:12:42] see if there is anything and help me
[1:12:45] to overcome that
[1:12:48] search me lord you are the porter i am
[1:12:52] the clay
[1:12:53] you know how you made me you know what
[1:12:55] type of spirit you gave me
[1:12:57] you know this personality i have you
[1:13:00] know this berry you know my
[1:13:01] genes my everything and
[1:13:05] you have the word and the word can
[1:13:07] correct
[1:13:08] me i need you it's a matter of
[1:13:12] life and death
[1:13:15] that's why sincerity
[1:13:27] then that i was talking about uh fasting
[1:13:30] that day
[1:13:32] that very day when i heard like
[1:13:35] you need to be more sincere
[1:13:38] and then the same day was like
[1:13:42] you walking with too many people
[1:13:47] i knew what he was telling me
[1:13:50] it's a group mentality
[1:13:54] it is a village mentality cultural
[1:13:57] mentality
[1:13:58] why do you do it the people in the
[1:14:00] message do it
[1:14:02] is what the prophet say well
[1:14:08] well what is it what the prophet said
[1:14:14] did you check what everybody does if is
[1:14:18] the message
[1:14:20] where are you going to hide you know
[1:14:25] you need to stand that day and say god
[1:14:29] i follow what you would say amen and
[1:14:32] saying that
[1:14:33] yeah in the message community there was
[1:14:35] this
[1:14:40] that won't work
[1:14:47] we need to be serious i uh
[1:14:50] i had that uh we don't talk about
[1:14:53] fasting and things like that but you you
[1:14:54] see the contest
[1:14:59] and when i came to church after that so
[1:15:02] it was like
[1:15:02] friday saturday i came to church
[1:15:06] guess what god had the message for me
[1:15:09] through the pastor he answered me
[1:15:14] i did not understand everything but he
[1:15:16] answered me
[1:15:17] when i was actually going like north he
[1:15:20] brought me
[1:15:20] up through the message anybody
[1:15:24] but a child was speaking just he was
[1:15:27] saying different sentences
[1:15:30] and hesitating at one point just like
[1:15:33] the prophet was doing
[1:15:34] in the tip i was listening who said god
[1:15:37] is
[1:15:38] speaking to me praise
[1:15:41] god so here i am i go out
[1:15:44] maybe i was looking for my uh
[1:15:47] my mother my mother-in-law and i see but
[1:15:50] a child
[1:15:50] coming from the side i never seen him
[1:15:52] coming from that side
[1:15:54] and i went but yeah this message was not
[1:15:56] just great but it was for me
[1:15:59] he said to me it was for me too
[1:16:01] [Laughter]
[1:16:04] then he said but do you can you take one
[1:16:07] of the service when i
[1:16:08] be out
[1:16:13] and that's how god does things like that
[1:16:16] it's not every time he has to do it this
[1:16:19] way
[1:16:21] but every every time we need
[1:16:25] favors from the lord amen and you cannot
[1:16:28] have it by
[1:16:29] just being a
[1:16:33] a church member
[1:16:39] well we need to close down i want a
[1:16:43] musician
[1:16:44] start coming uh
[1:16:49] god is wonderful
[1:16:53] when he was telling me
[1:16:57] you walk with too many i knew but
[1:17:01] something in me was like is it
[1:17:04] my mind where is god
[1:17:08] but later on it was god
[1:17:11] yes no we
[1:17:15] are not the jewish people they can go as
[1:17:18] a nation
[1:17:20] we are individuals and god
[1:17:23] value our personal life
[1:17:27] personal experience with him
[1:17:30] these things about complying
[1:17:34] you know formality and just
[1:17:38] no god is not in it but everyone was
[1:17:41] praying for a woman
[1:17:43] she has been through a lot of things
[1:17:46] prostitution alcohol this and that but
[1:17:50] bernie tells her you could be a wife of
[1:17:53] somebody what's going on and you have
[1:17:57] let a
[1:17:57] demon get in you

[1:18:07] can i do whatever
[1:18:09] say let's pray about it okay she went to
[1:18:12] her knees
[1:18:13] and she started praying a few minutes
[1:18:16] later
[1:18:16] she stood up and said okay okay i think
[1:18:19] i'm going to change now
[1:18:21] by the way i'm saying that again
[1:18:24] sincerity yeah
[1:18:28] she did it but what i'm saying was just
[1:18:31] a mental thing say

[1:18:49] god is tired with these things formality
[1:18:52] he's tired he gave us so much
[1:18:56] responsibility
[1:18:59] now we gotta be real with it
[1:19:03] is that right yeah we gotta be real with
[1:19:06] it
[1:19:09] you will appreciate it now is the time
[1:19:13] to say

[1:19:38] but you know god only true experience
[1:19:41] that's what the
[1:19:42] baptismal of holy ghost is is experience
[1:19:45] but our doctrine is based upon the word
[1:19:48] of god
[1:19:50] but you know god through what you're

[1:28:57] it spoke to me you know and
[1:29:00] all of us we we get things in this life
[1:29:03] and this this nature that we deal with
[1:29:06] and that we don't like
[1:29:08] but we got tools tonight on how to deal
[1:29:09] with it
[1:29:11] you know some of us we have a impatience
[1:29:14] you know
[1:29:15] some people are people pleasers they get
[1:29:17] in situations all the time and say
[1:29:19] things they don't even mean
[1:29:20] trying to make everybody around them
[1:29:21] happy or find themselves in compromising
[1:29:23] positions
[1:29:24] because they're trying to please
[1:29:25] everybody or you have some people who
[1:29:28] have to know everything you know and
[1:29:29] nobody no matter what story they tell
[1:29:31] i've got to tell one better right we all
[1:29:34] deal with these things right
[1:29:36] but what he was saying was be real and
[1:29:39] say god i
[1:29:39] recognize this in me and i'm laying it
[1:29:42] on the altar and i'm going to ignore
[1:29:43] that thing
[1:29:44] and i'm not going to have that in my
[1:29:46] life anymore but i just want your spirit
[1:29:48] to control me be real and be sincere
[1:29:52] amen see i don't want that thing anymore
[1:29:54] i don't want that old
[1:29:56] lying exaggerating spirit anymore i
[1:29:58] don't want any of those things anymore
[1:29:59] i'm just going to lay it on the altar
[1:30:01] and i'm going to turn and walk away from
[1:30:02] it lord and i'm going to trust you
[1:30:06] praise god you know when god did the
[1:30:09] things he'd done for us he didn't do it
[1:30:10] without sincerity
[1:30:13] when god came as his only begotten son
[1:30:16] and he lived a life
[1:30:17] of perfection before us and he died a
[1:30:19] brutal death to pay for our sins
[1:30:22] he didn't do it without sincerity when
[1:30:24] jesus was laboring in gethsemane to
[1:30:26] overcome he wasn't doing it without
[1:30:28] sincerity
[1:30:29] when god did everything he did he didn't
[1:30:30] do it without sincerity
[1:30:32] amen and the example we've had in our
[1:30:34] lives with the prophet of god
[1:30:35] amen a tremendously gifted man who god
[1:30:39] spoke to had visions he
[1:30:40] he knew what was going to happen he
[1:30:42] didn't live a life without sincerity
[1:30:45] but he was sincere and if god went
[1:30:49] through all of that
[1:30:50] and god was sincere and the prophet was
[1:30:53] sincere
[1:30:54] i want to be sincere i want to be
[1:30:57] more sincere i mean even even the
[1:31:00] prophet was told amen when he was
[1:31:02] talking about
[1:31:03] in the vision of binding the mamba he
[1:31:04] was told you must be
[1:31:06] more sincere and this was a man who was
[1:31:10] sincere
[1:31:12] but god desired for for this
[1:31:15] for this level that this prophet was
[1:31:17] going to have to operate at
[1:31:18] he desired he said for this you're going
[1:31:20] to have to be more sincere
[1:31:22] so it means there's something to
[1:31:23] sincerity
[1:31:25] it brings about a greater revelation a
[1:31:27] greater power
[1:31:28] another manifestation whatever it is
[1:31:30] because because
[1:31:31] in the vision i mean god could have just
[1:31:33] said this is what you're going to do
[1:31:35] because god could have made him do it
[1:31:37] but he said in order to do this you must
[1:31:39] be more sincere
[1:31:41] so that means there's something to
[1:31:43] sincerity it brings about
[1:31:45] something in the plan of god it produces
[1:31:47] something
[1:31:48] right amen and if that was the case
[1:31:51] there
[1:31:52] i wonder if it's the case now
[1:31:55] if the prophet in order to bind and lose
[1:31:58] had to be more sincere
[1:32:00] what about us living here today are we
[1:32:02] going to be able to move higher in the
[1:32:03] things of god into the position he's
[1:32:05] called us to and to the manifestations
[1:32:07] he's called us to
[1:32:08] without sincerity but for the prophet
[1:32:12] more sincerity brought another
[1:32:14] revelation another
[1:32:15] manifestation and i say i want to be
[1:32:19] more sincere
[1:32:21] god help me to be more sincere help me
[1:32:24] to make this
[1:32:26] message and what was preached here
[1:32:28] tonight make it
[1:32:29] everything not just something i heard
[1:32:32] that was good and i can go home and say
[1:32:34] i heard a good sermon
[1:32:35] but it's more than that it's my life
[1:32:37] it's it's who i
[1:32:38] am it's my identification and this this
[1:32:41] message of
[1:32:41] greater sincerity and overcoming the
[1:32:44] human barrier it's who i am it's what i
[1:32:46] want it's the desire of my life
[1:32:49] amen i want to be more sincere
[1:32:53] and i know you do too let's just bow our
[1:32:56] heads and say lord

[1:33:08] within each of us

[1:33:12] that barrier lord

[1:33:16] was lived lord and

[1:33:30] see you move in a greater way to
[1:33:32] overcome this barrier

[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:33] sing that song again but as we do let's
[1:36:36] be a little more specific
[1:36:39] we all know the things that we deal with
[1:36:42] you know some some of us struggle with
[1:36:44] vanity we're so
[1:36:45] worried about what everybody thinks
[1:36:46] about us that we're always trying to
[1:36:48] look
[1:36:48] good and always trying to get you know
[1:36:51] to be impressive to somebody or somebody
[1:36:52] to be impressed with us
[1:36:53] we want to look a certain way or say
[1:36:55] something or
[1:36:56] or some of us listen to too many voices
[1:36:59] and we're like
[1:37:00] like brother jean said we walk with too
[1:37:01] many and there's too many opinions
[1:37:03] and we're always confused we never know
[1:37:04] where we stand because we're always
[1:37:06] trying
[1:37:07] to listen to too many voices we all have
[1:37:10] something different there's a different
[1:37:11] barrier for each of us
[1:37:13] there's something we deal with but when

[1:37:49] to be free from that burial
[1:37:50] i'm doing what the prophet said i'm
[1:37:52] laying it on the altar with this song
[1:37:54] right here
[1:37:54] and i'm going to walk away and if that
[1:37:56] everything ever creeps up again
[1:37:58] i'm going to say that's lying because
[1:38:00] i've been set free in the name of jesus
[1:38:02] christ i'm not going to go back to that
[1:38:05] i'm going to walk away from it amen so
