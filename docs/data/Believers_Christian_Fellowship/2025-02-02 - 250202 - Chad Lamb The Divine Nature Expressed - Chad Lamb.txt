chapter 4:1 13 while we're standing then we'll let you have your seats Ephesians 4:13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ amen amen God bless you as you have your seats may the Lord bless us as we look into his word amen just want to remind you that this afternoon we'll have the communion and feet washing so we'll come back for that also um wanted to let you know that brother Emanuel arrived safely in Washington DC he drove a a rental truck a U-Haul truck full of uh of their household goods down there and um I just want to appreciate several of the brothers from here who on the last minute we we really didn't know when he was moving and what all was happening and last minute he made a plea from the pull pit if anybody would like to help and I'm sitting in my seat going oh my goodness we've got to do something but then I I I went home and I talked to my boys and I found out that some young men had put together a group to go down and Brother Kyle wer went down in the afternoon to help him brother Greg bird went down also and helped him and uh then uh brother Chuck Williams also went along brother Joshua small brother Gabe golden Zach golden David lamb Jonathan Lamb and Samuel pitsenberger God bless you all and thank you so much also brother Emanuel had a wonderful testimony uh he said that when he went to pick up the the moving van the short drive from the moving rental the van rental place to his home threw his back out he said he was an extreme lower back pain he said I was crippled brother he said I never could have got anything in that truck without these brothers help and then he told me uh uh in a text when he arrived safely he said that he was up all night he didn't sleep at all Thursday night cuz his lower back was so bad he said in the most extreme some of the most extreme pain he's ever had and um but he told me when he got in the car and started driving it was a 7-hour drive now can you imagine how miserable you would be laying in bed knowing that you're hurting you got to get up and drive in the same car the same van that threw your back out for 7even hours he said as soon as he got in and started driving he was healed instantly and it never hurt for 7even hours and he's completely fine so I just wanted to share that with you he wanted to thank you all for that he wrote out a little testimony here he said thank you so much for praying for us I made it to Washington DC safely and the the Lord granted me strength to drive the S hours it took to get there with no back pain we are so grateful for the young men who came Thursday evening to assist in loading the truck we appreciate your continued prayer God bless you amen I know many of you were praying and I wanted to share that with you god heard your prayers amen for our brother also another part of this testimony said he's grateful for the young men who came and helped him so that's good brother Kyle you're still a young man and brother Greg you and brother Chuck you guys are all young men so that was wonderful I would take that and Bank on it amen say that's nothing but the truth brother amen so we just appreciate everybody praying and thankful that he's there he's going to come back uh he's going to fly back sometime this next week he's going to load a van again on Friday and uh he and his family then will be uh driving back to Washington DC to stay there so just keep him in prayer there's a lot of back and forth and a lot of things he's got to do amen so let's look to to this subject here um uh let's turn what we we read here that we are to come into a perfect man un the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and we believe we're in that age according to the prophecy and according to the word that God is going to fully reveal himself in Bride form we're going to come as a bride into that full stature into that perfect man and I just like to know I I know so many of you know it we've talked about so many times but when we say perfect man we don't mean Flawless it's not the word flawless man the only way that we are flawless is we're Flawless by the Redemption Act of the blood of Jesus Christ and that makes us perfect and Flawless but this word perfect means fully mature or completed it's a finished work it's come to what God wants it to be and when we look at this we're going to come into a perfect man if we don't understand that he's talking about full maturity or completion then we start thinking but I still have flaws and I still have this and listen brother Benham said we have a sticky caer nature that's going to bother us as long as we're in it as long as we're in this world he said and so we've got to get past that and understand that this word that's been given to us and the Holy Ghost has been released to us in this age is to bring us into a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ let's turn over to Second Peter together and read about this statue of a perfect man this divine nature in second Peter second Peter um chapter 1 verse three according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain un to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and div virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance into Temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so we know that this is going to be given to us by A Promise by a precious promise this is not this is not something that we are going to work our way into as far as striving and climbing into it of our own effort but this is a promise that's God given to us that we can be a partaker of this divine nature and we're going to be a partaker by the promise of God working in our life by the power of the spirit of God working in us and so I want to uh read this quote out a statue of a perfect man brother vam says uh Peter is saying here how that we must be partakers of his divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God Amen is that what we're trying to do grow into the stature of God Amen and and so when he says we're trying to grow into the stature of God to me it looks like a process amen that we're growing God's growing us into that perfect man un the fullness of the statue of Christ and here he says the stature of God and so I just want to speak on that for a little bit this morning amen I I stand Here confessing to you that I'm absolutely weak because I had a horrible day yesterday praise God it's not because anybody did anything it's because I strived and strived and strived all day for inspiration and nothing came and it was miserable I don't know if you've ever been there but if you've been there you know what I mean it's one of the most miserable feelings in the world you Pace the floor you pray I come in here and pray I go back to my office and pray I read I whatever you know turn on music sing a little bit and feel pretty good and go write a scripture down and then nothing Fizzles but this morning as I was laying in bed I I I opened my eyes early and I said I don't want to get up and I closed my eyes again as I was laying there closing my eyes God started putting pieces together for me and I just say I know somebody was praying and I just say thank you amen you can't we can't do this by ourselves there's not a one of us that can do this by ourselves it it takes all of us depending on God we have confidence that God's placed gifts in our in our church and placed gifts in different one but those gifts operate as we pull on them amen and as we all come together and so I know there was many of you over here praying on Saturday I watched as you come and go and it encourages me so much and I know that you were praying last night and this morning and I believe God is going to answer those prayers so I'm going to do my very best this morning just to relax and get out of the way and let God work and you just pulled and see what God has for you because I don't have anything for you amen but God has something for you I've never seen him gather his children together and not feed them I've never seen him fail to feed his sheep when he's called them together and United them together and I have confidence in that and so I'm just praying that God will help me to relax myself and get out of the way so we know that God is calling us to express this divine nature and we know we know beyond a shadow of a doubt we're in that hour because of the prophetic message that we' received so we're not in an hour that we're hoping that we can be and be more like Christ and but but we're not in Luther's day we're not in Wesley's day we're not here in a partial fulfillment we're not here under a dip in the Holy Ghost but we are here under the fullness of everything the full word has been rest restor the fullness of the spirit has come back into the church to bring the full word into manifestation we're not dwelling in the era of partiality we now know the full potential is here it is all here and we're not striving for another age we're not waiting for future events we have come to that time we have come to the climax of The Gentile Church we've come to the climax of the of the dispensation of the Gentiles climaxing in a bride and that Bride is a people that he has gathered by predestination to himself that he is going to fill with himself and he is going to manifest himself through them so that it becomes Christ in Bride form Christ clothed in the clothing of his bride it's like a patchwork quilk you're a patch and I'm a patch and we're all a patch but inside is Christ that's the age that we're in and so now we know that we don't have to if I could say this way we don't have to settle for partial we shouldn't be settling for partial and neither can we Strongarm things in with with the when it comes to God and well did I learn that yesterday I can't force God to give me inspiration I can't arm wrestle him I can't demand it I can't I'm utterly dependent on God we cannot Strongarm God into anything God is Sovereign and does as he wishes as he needs for whatever purpose he needs to manifest himself and so we we we we do Do not sit back and just say you know whatever will be will be maybe in the fut no this is the day this is the day for a people on the Earth to manifest Christ this is the day amen for a people to be surrendered to be sold out to be dead to themselves to have the Life of Christ Living inside because God has brought the full potential back into his bride so we're growing into that that nature but we're not listen we should never be waiting for something else we should be taking advantage of what God's given us understanding I can't Strongarm anything out of God or force him to do anything all I can do is continually surrender and believe and ask and pray and and and wait on the Lord knowing that this is the hour and there's another knowing that we need to have we need to know that this is the hour that's wonderful this is the hour of full potential everything's been released but I also must know amen by a personal meeting with God himself that I'm part of that program because if I don't know that I'm part of that program we can say yeah everything's been restored the word's been restored the spirits here full but I still am questioning my part of the program we're never going to come to full maturity until we can settle the question I know that God's called me and we can look in the mirror and say I'm a million miles from what I ought to be and I he shouldn't have called me we can say all of those things looking at the human perspective but we've got to get down and say but God has done something inside of me amen he's connected me to this word amen and I believe it so I can't help it it's just the way it is and so then I believe that that full potential that is here is to bring me into the stature of Christ me me into a perfect man amen praise God in in the message identification he says oh no no other nature could do this no cuz he was molded the perfect character of God for it was a fallen character that all nature had all men had a fallen character even everything that was under man fell everything had got a dying character and he had a living character so he expressed it in Christ and he paid the price so it Christ came to be that living character of God to display God on this Earth but we all came with a fallen character yes because we came under man we came under the fall and we look in uh this uh questions and answers on Hebrews brother B says now let's take let's let's take back to Cain could you tell me where that spirit and that meanness come from Cain look if Cain was the son of Adam which was a Son of God where did that evil come from the first thing when he was born born he hated he was a murderer he was jealous and now take the nature of his daddy the very start in the beginning Lucifer in the beginning he was jealous of Michael what started the whole trouble how many knows that and Cain was the nature of his father which he was jealous of his brother and slew him see that nature could not have come of that pure seed it had to come out of this perverted stream so we know that that First John 3 tells us that Cain was of the wicked one so Satan had found a way to inject his nature into humanity and he did it through through the Fall In the Garden of Eden and then we know that through the intermingling and the fall of Man everybody comes with a fallen nature and so we struggle with that Fallen nature brother vanam said in 1964 in questions and answers he said this is a dying spirit and a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two natur's in you at one time if there wasn't if that wasn't the case what are we struggling with what are we fighting with why are we struggling what are we overcoming remember brother bam told the story we we read it here a few weeks ago of the Indian chief who got born again was baptized with the Holy Ghost and somebody asked him how are you doing he said Sometimes good sometimes bad said what do you mean he said since I've got the Holy Ghost there's two dogs fighting in me black dog and a white dog and and and you know they they asked him the question which one wins he said which one I feed the most and brother benam made the comment he says see it depends on which n nature you cater to and so you know we had old ideas before the message I remember as a boy we had these old ideas that the baptism of the Holy Ghost cured everything every the struggle was over amen and and you're a new creature in Christ Jesus you're absolutely a new creature but what's a new creature the Inside Man the outside man yet is not a new creature he's coming subject to the Inside Man and must be put uh must be put under our feet yeah he must be made subject but yet he's still there amen and that's why we're still striving for a change in the atoms that's why we're still striving to be clothed upon with a Heavenly Body and with a glorified body to have the right Spirit and the right body and the right soul all uni unified together so that the struggle is over we're still longing for that even under the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what the Holy Ghost has done is given us a power and a strength that we never had before amen and it unlock the nature that was in the SE Gene of God to start manifesting the life of God under the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen but there's two Natures there can be two Natures in us at once and it depends on which one we cater to I said God help me to stop catering to the wrong one I'm tired of getting bit by the black dog yeah I got teeth marks all over me and I'm sick of it amen but but somehow through old habits and through and through distractions and through the tantalizing Temptations of the world we keep throwing bones to the old black dog every once in a while we throw him a steak and he gets too strong and yeah my desire is to starve that guy to death and so we find out then now this is the state that we're in because of the fall and so from the very beginning brother B said God's desire was to dwell among men and dwell in men and among men and have his family of God upon the Earth that's what he desired at the beginning to have this perfect world and to dwell with his family a family of God in Fellowship together upon the face of the Earth but Satan found a way to to he found a way to inject part of his nature through the serpent into man so he could have access to man yeah so that he could he could circumvent God's plan but you never stop God's plan because God foresaw all things before the foundation of the world and God was going to make a way where he could dwell in man amen he was going to do so by the by the price of redemption that was paid but when we come to Jesus now we're coming to a man that's not born with a fallen nature right he was virgin born in the message hear ye him brother B said but the Bible said there was no beauty that we should desire him probably a little bitty fella stooped in the shoulder or something we all hit as it were our faces from him there never was a character like it like that that's that real man is you don't measure a man's muscle but by the bags of the knees and his pants where he's been praying that's the way you measure a man by character there was never a character like Jesus Christ he wasn't born with the wrong character he was born with the character of God Amen and we find that the battle from the beginning has been a battle over Dominion yeah it's been a battle over rulership who will rule the Earth amen and we find in ourselves that we're in the midst of this battle because the battle raging today is Raging on this lump of earth right here and there's two factions Waring and they want they want to have preeminence they want to have dominion over this lump of the earth amen and the battle the greatest battle is going being fought in our minds so and what's it for the battle is is being fought for control who's going to control the the Devil is a usurper he is a he's a dictator he's a usurper he's a manipulator but Christ is a gentleman so the devil in order to have control he will manipulate he will force he will persuade he will do all kinds of manner of evil and and he'll use fear he'll use manipulation he'll use whatever he can use to try to gain Dominion but Christ he's a gentleman he doesn't manipulate he doesn't control he doesn't persuade he doesn't use fear all he does is throw out his word and he waits for somebody to yield to him and then he takes the place that's yielded to him amen he's not a dictator but does he want control yes he wants control because what is his whole purpose to have preeminence he wants to have preeminence in a people that's his desire that's the second fold of his three-fold plan of the one purpose he had is to have de preeminence so does he want preeminence over you yes does the devil want preeminence over you yes but the devil will use every Wicked tactic Under the Sun to force you to manipulate you to trick you to scare you to to whatever he has to do Amen to hijack you to to Blackmail you but Christ is a gentleman all he does is share with you his promise he gives you a vision of what he wants for you he shares with you your purpose and your plan and who he thinks you are and what he thinks of you and all he does is he just take he just opens up his mind and he gives you a picture into his thinking and then and then that's it then he waits for us to say Lord come and take me that's what I want I want you to have me I want you to be my Lord I want you to control me so two different means of control amen but when we look at Jesus now he become the model he become the expression Colossians 2:9 says for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so everything that God was he poured into Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was manifesting God the nature the character of God in Hebrews 1 2 and 3 he says ha he hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person so Christ became the very Express or the exact fleshly replica of everything that God was was replicated in the flesh and then you could see the character of God and and as I speak of this I I I I want to go to a quote here in the message Shalom because my mind goes to this place as I've been meditating because to have this perfect Flawless character the character of Jesus Christ it doesn't always match what our idea of perfect character should be and in the day Jesus was alive it didn't match their idea of what perfect character should be they were very confused about things that he said and things that he did and actions that he took yeah right and so it just goes to show that maybe we don't have the right idea of what perfect character is amen maybe God knows yeah maybe we should yield ourselves to him and not try to dictate what what is perfect character right man sometimes what I what I find more than anything uh over and over and over again is I have formulated my own ideas and I filter everything through my own thinking right I'm saying more and more God please break that thinking just break it away and let me be yielded to you to do whatever you want to do the way you want to do it in the message Shalom this is what he describes of Jesus in his Earthly Ministry he says sir there's a young fellow around here by the name of Jesus of Nazareth have nothing to do with him what what does our bible teach us God Is Love who was the first with you when you were born your kind old priest that's right who came to you when you was in need didn't have no money and loaned you some money your kind old priest exactly who put his hand on your shoulder and on your mother's shoulder when you was about to separate and prayed you back to God your kind old priest who was it took sides with you when you and your neighbor was in fusses and brought you back together in Fellowship your kind old priest that's right who is it is who who is it is the last words going to say over you at your day uh at that day out yonder who is it they let you lay there and rock but your kind old priest comes and blesses you and sends the word of God along with you your kind old priest what about this guy called Jesus of of Nazareth then see what school did he come from your kind old priest had to sacrifice all of his life his grandfather was a priest his great great great great great-grandfather was a priest he put his whole time in the organization he is trained to the word he knows what he is talking about now we're talking about fruits of the spirit kind love joy peace understanding longsuffering patien see fruit of the spirit what about this Jesus where did he come from we haven't got a word that he ever come out of any school all he does is try to tear up the schools that we've built not much fruit of the spirit there is it what did he do up there when them poor Merchants down there and then businessmen that had to they they don't raise sheep so they set a little pen out there so the man can bring in a sheep that poor businessman he wants to offer a sheep because it's God's requirement he brings in the Sheep to sell to the businessman so that he can offer for a soul what has this Jesus of Nazareth done kicked over his tables took some leather and FL it together beat the priest out of there and called your kind old priest a snake in the grass a hypocrite boy they're making a strong case now you call that fruit of the spirit certainly not then where is your fruit of the spirit Landing up at no more than you think of compassion and him going through a multitude of people there multitudes lying blind crippled Afflicted withered halt lame and never healed any of them full of compassion people with a carnal mind will never know it amen that's the whole point friends people with a carnal mind will never know it am seminaries don't touch it it's a revelation certainly fruit of the spirit drops off there doesn't it them priests had 10 times the fruit of the spirit I'm just talking of outward manifestations in their idea that's what brother B said he had 10 times the fruit of the spirit how could you know what's right the man estation of the spoken word of God being made manifest light of the hour certainly there is what the evidence of the holy spirit is believing the word of God when it's manifested he was the word manifested and some of them denied it laughed at it made fun of him and called him a fortune teller some evil spirit there is evidence speaking in tongues there is evidence of the fruits the only evidence there is is when man believe the written word when it's Vindicated walking in the light of it amen so we find out that they they looked at the perfect Flawless character of Jesus Christ and they found fault with it yeah isn't that amazing right the perfect Flawless character they thought it was cruel for him to walk through the pool of Bethesda with the power to heal and heal nobody but one they didn't understand it they didn't understand it they thought it was cruel for him to call the kind old priest to snake in the grass sounded cruel to call the Pharisees Children of the devil it did sound cruel yeah it sound cruel if we preach like that I mean it sounds cruel but he had perfect character Flawless perfect character right it when he ran through the temple flipping over the tables of the money changers and beating them on the back those money changers who got a whip to the back had a hard time believing he had Flawless character sometimes we have to be careful how we judge one another we got to be careful for many reasons one is cu we're still growing we're all still growing we got to be careful what judgment we lay on our brothers and sisters because the real evidence of the Holy Ghost is not being the nicest person in the room amen the real evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able to believe the word for your day to surrender your life to it to let Christ come and work his will in us will it bring us the fruits of the spir yes the fruits of the spirit should be an outcropping but we're all growing in that still when we look at the divine nature first I want to read this quote from Satan's Eden I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't I preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it is the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age right watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so much in demonstration but in action what it does according to the word that's the Holy Ghost In Action what it does according to the word amen and so uh when I looked at these virtues I'll just read through them Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity when brother Venom starts talking about this he says not just virtue he said but holy ghost virtue it's different kind of virtue because there there some of us can be born with certain of these characteristics or attributes that are just natural to us some of us are just naturally longsuffering just patient you ever met somebody who's just patient well they they got that genetically that doesn't mean it's Holy Ghost patience right we understand right so there's patience but there's Holy Ghost patience there's Temperance you have some people who are very self-disciplined they can work out they can eat right they can get up the same time every day they're super disciplined people they're that way by that's not Holy Ghost Temperance that's Temperance so none of these virtues that we're talking about are virtues that are part of our natural life These are virtues that come from the inside amen they're quickened by the Holy Ghost they're empowered by the Holy Ghost there's Holy Ghost Faith there's Holy Ghost virtue Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost patience Holy Ghost godliness Holy Ghost brotherly kindness and Holy Ghost charity and when we look at the Holy Ghost through these Divine Natures we we find out then if it's not if it's not just an inborn nature just something that you just have like brother Gabe preached one time on the grab bag of life and the grab bag of Life can give you a lot of bad things but it can give you some good things right you can be born just super self-control you can be born super disciplined you can be born I mean with an inward strength what they call a strong Constitution you can just bear down under a lot of things because you have a strong Constitution but that's not what this is amen this is completely different that just comes by that this is not anything that's inborn by Nature this is something that's part of the seed Gene of God it's part of the life of God quickened by the Holy Ghost ghost and empowered so then that means these virtues have everything to do with fulfilling the life and purpose of Jesus Christ which is the word amen so these virtues are attached to the word amen oh I could just you have some you you say you know brotherly kindness well we have some people who are absolutely just super bubbly and friendly all the time but this is this is deeper than that amen this is Holy Ghost brotherly kindness This Is The Life of Christ in brotherly kindness coming out of you amen and so that's what we need brother B said in the message the way back he said that's the way the holy spirit is it's not something you smear on or something like that it's a new birth you've got to be born again and these virtues of the Holy Ghost has has to come from the inside out so we you know the way it is those of us who are born naturally with one of these gifts or another we're born with natural self-discipline I mean you look at everybody else who's random and undisciplined as far from God that's our n that's the natural man we do that all the time somebody who's super nice and just bubbly and super friendly and you have somebody that's more of an introvert and they just don't go around talking to everybody in the for you they kind of keep to themselves it's not that they're not kind to their Brethren they just don't have the same temperament and you look to them and you say that's all natural right that's all natural stuff that's not what he's talking about what kind of faith is this Holy Ghost Faith what kind of Faith to believe the word for your day amen it takes the virtue from the Holy Ghost to believe the word for your day and keep believing as it unfolds virtue this is strength this is strength this kind of strength is not your natural-born human Constitution this is strength to Bear down and bear under and bear with for what reason for the word's sake amen cuz it's not the fleshly re it's not the outside man this is the inside man this is virtue that gives you the strength to stand in the face of criticism and stand with the word to take the pressure that comes Amen in persecution and be able to bear under or be able to bear under a trial and gives you special strength to bear under that trial that's Holy Ghost virtue and it has to do with the word right knowledge what kind of knowledge is this Holy Ghost knowledge the knowledge of Jesus Christ the the the word of God being revealed to you and a knowledge and an understanding having the mind of Christ amen that gets you through your trials so that you can manifest the word despite all the confusion that's around you there's a holy ghost knowledge it's not your natural ability to remember facts amen this is another kind of knowledge that comes by Revelation that gives you the knowledge amen like like like when we read in uh psalms 27 in the Rapture message he says thou has set my head above mine enemies that'll put me upon a Rock Amen what is that that's a place of Revelation where your understanding is higher than every body else around you and you can endure the trial and keep walking in the word because of Holy Ghost knowledge you know who you are you know what God's doing you know he's trying to accomplish and you just keep moving in the manifestation of the word amen amen Holy Ghost Temperance amen that's to bring self-control that's to bring this body subject to his word I don't think the divine nature comes to give you Temperance so you can get up early for work so you don't eat an extra dessert yeah that's carnal amen right I hope you're getting it we put so much stock on the wrong thing and that's what not what these Natures are here to produce they're not here to make you the most disciplined human being they're not here to make you the nicest person is these Natures are here so you can manifest the life of Jesus Christ so that you can manifest the word in every situation so that you can be him manifesting himself in this world yeah patience Holy Ghost patience I don't think Holy Ghost patience come so you can stand in line longer and wait for the discount so you can be patient on Black Friday and do you understand what I'm saying friends this is Holy Ghost patience to make you patient while waiting on God and waiting for God and waiting for God to move on the scene and waiting for his word to be made manifest and you wait patiently you can be impatient about other things you can come home from work and be impatient because the supper's not ready yet and that's okay but this Holy Ghost patience is makes you patience while you're waiting on God and waiting for God right godliness man this isn't a Creed this isn't a set of orders this isn't trying to do anything this is a a godlikeness that comes out of us amen you going to ask yourself what is God like when we read the Bible we find what God's like God is a god of Mercy God's a god of love he's a god of judgment yeah he's a is a god of Truth there are many facet facets to God sometimes we narrow it down we we make God be like the way we want God to be right so sometimes we want God to be just an all loving God and loving and merciful in the fact that everything I do is okay and we don't want God to be a judging God but sometimes we want God to be a judging God when it comes to everybody else we don't want him to be a merciful god yes yes so this is not godliness according to our thinking not godliness according to the church standard this is Holy Ghost godliness brotherly kindness it's the same way you and I both have seen people who can smooth and smooth and smooth make you feel so good and flatter you to no end and then later they say oh yeah come here and do this and come over to my house and leave go oh I hope they don't come over has anybody ever done that you don't have to raise your hand I'll raise mine that was a put on and we've everyone done it in order to be nice but it wasn't genuine from the heart this is a different kind of Brotherly kindness It's not the one that is just super bubbly it can be bubbly or not bubbly it can be outgoing or notgoing but this is something that comes from the nature of God that cause you to love your brother and love your brother maybe when he's being unlovable and then charity is love there nothing to do with human love nothing this is a much higher love this is the love that God has and this kind of love God is love Jesus Christ was the great attribute of God Called Love Is that what brother B said he was God's love on display and God's love on display would throw tables over in a temple and beat people out the door with a whip so our human love and our concepts of human love got to go out the door this is a different kind of love this is God's love this is the kind of love that can love Peter and turn and look at Peter and say get behind me Satan that can look at James and and John and say you don't know what Spirit you two are of that's love brother said love is corrective amen love is sacrificial it was the love God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son love is sacrificial love gives of itself amen and love does what's best yeah right but not always what feels good right and all of these attributes will say of the divine nature they all all give they they all come in response to something yes they all come when this kind of virtue is needed to respond to a circumstance or a situation where this virtue needs to to express so in brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is not expressed when all the brothers are being kind right brotherly kindness is best expressed when somebody needs your brotherly kindness amen patience expressed at a at something that's pressing upon you that needs to move and needs to change amen patience is a is it's an expression of God in response to a circumstance Temperance self-control amen something that's going to bring you into the control this outer manic control this flesh it's a response into a set of circumstances it's the very Life of Christ on the inside of you amen manifesting his own life and bringing about his own purpose in you it's his life that's why it's Holy Ghost Faith Holy Ghost virtue Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost patience Holy Ghost godliness Holy Ghost brotherly kindness and Holy Ghost love why it's the very life of Jesus Christ coming through your flesh so that you can fulfill the purpose that he has for you it is not the outer man why because this message is not Reformation this message is transformation it's the inside man taking dominion over the outer man the outer man can still be a bit impatient that comes from the grab bag too and and this conversion is not to make the outer man who used to be impatient and it comes from a long line of impatient people and all of a sudden he's the most patient human being in the world he can still be impatient about certain things but when it comes to the word he can wait on God to fulfill his own word he can stand the test he can with patience wait for God to come on the scene and fulfill his promise amen the outer man's not getting converted he's being controlled amen that's why these virtues in order for these virtues to manifest there has to be something that's requiring The Virtue to manifest right so what what would be requiring Temperance well there's something that's that that that there's an opportunity there's a there's something that's that's tempting there's something that that you desire there's something that the flesh wants and God's going to have to give you Temperance to overcome it virtue where you going to need strength there's something going on that's we're going to require strength and that is not your strength that is God's strength so all of these virtues are coming to me in response to circumstances or situations that need this kind of virtue that's why sometimes when we get into situations listen we this is what brother I'm just going to read it it's my next quote thank God said after you done come from here to here to here to here to here to here he's talking about the statute of a perfect man climbing up that pyramid now you're coming into the full stature now a Son of God but you got to have this plus all this and you can't even start till you get this talking about faith now remember the black bird with peacock feathers don't forget him don't try to add it till you're actually born again cuz it won't work and you can't make it work it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine born of give Dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you amen love that quote amen you see comes on up all right coming into per Perfection now amen so now what God knows is God knows he's planted a seed of himself inside of you and inside God has all God's genetics so if these virtues are part of God's genetics it's in that seed and God knows that he's given you the Holy Ghost he can Empower you and unlock these seeds and give you the strength amen so now what God needs to do in order to get these virtues to manifest he's got to bring an opposition to The Virtue hallelujah what made us think we were going to Coast through life and have it easy we've got to manifest the life of Jesus Christ so he's going to bring an opposition to these virtues amen so that you can express Holy Ghost virtue Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost patience amen not your own patience and not your own Temperance but his oh thank you that's why sometimes when we dig down a little deeper we get to a place where we say God I don't have the strength to go through this trial amen how many of you listened to perfect strength and perfect weakness recently brother Stan price said he recommends that one and I know many have have read it and listen to it but it gets to a place where you say God I physically I mentally I emotionally do not have the strength to endure another day of this trial I need your virtue cuz mine's gone you get to a place sometimes where you say God I'm absolutely confused I have no idea what's going on I'm hearing different things from different people and I've got all this confusion in my mind and people all these voices are telling me different things I need Holy Ghost knowledge because I've come to the end of my wits I don't know what I should do I don't know what is the truth I don't know what the solution and my problem is God I need Supernatural Holy Ghost Knowledge from your word to show me what I need to do next amen so when we've come to the end of ours then maybe we can have his come to the end of our virtue then maybe we can have his virtue and I'd rather have his virtue than my virtue so I say God help me come to the end of my virtue fast help me to come to the end of my knowledge quickly help me to come to the end of my patience immediately so that I can have his amen I want to read Revelation 3 let's go back here together this has been stirring in me since uh brother Emanuel preached on Wednesday he stir up some things inside of me in in Revelation 3 we're going to read verse 14 the leoan church Age and and he read this and and we'll highlight some of these things in uh Revelation 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of leans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love and rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent let's go back to verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with good and have need of nothing and knowest not Thou Art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked when they saw themselves they didn't see themselves in need but when God saw them he saw them with great need tremendous need because their condition was actually that of being uh wretched miserable poor blind and naked so they were in a terrible condition but they thought that they were fine and now we're looking spiritually because their spirit this is their spiritual condition yeah it's church at the end time but they thought that they were fine and so uh the D that's that's dangerous to me I kind of think it's dangerous to be born with a really nice good character yeah right right yeah amen I mean that's what we all want nobody wants the difficult child to manage everybody wants the easy peasy everything's fine but the danger comes when we don't realize we have a need yeah when we're born with a strong Constitution and we just can bear down it we don't realize we need a different kind of virtue yeah when we have knowledge and we're able to retain everything that we read and we can put it all together we don't realize we need a different kind of knowledge when we have Temperance self-control we're just born that way don't we don't realize that that is dangerous Temperance yeah amen dangerous virtue dangerous patience because it masks our need amen right so I I think God in his great wisdom make sure we have need and that's called trial yes and I thank God when he shows us that we have a need yes you know yeah when brother Emanuel started breaking that down in the Book of Luke and he started going over to lazarus's family and how he said everything was good they had Jesus coming to their table they they knew the ministry they had Lazarus and Mary Martha but then they lost Lazarus and they they wanted Jesus to come and heal him and and they they lost something amen and and he delayed his he delayed his coming so that Lazarus would now be dead and now they find themselves in a tremendous place of need and that's when he finally comes to them when all hope is gone and they they have nothing but need and all the security is gone and everything that they were resting upon is gone amen and now he shows up and in the hour of need what does God give Martha he gives her a revelation what does she get she gets something more than information she gets something more than false security she gets something more than a guarantee of a physical amen something physical that'll restore her back to security what she gets is something greater than anything she's ever had before she gets a revelation of who Jesus is what produced that it was her great need amen her great need produced the circumstances that would bring her to a higher Revelation than she ever had she knew he was a prophet she knew he was a tremendous man she knew she loved him and she knew that he took care of them and all the things that he did but now she comes to something that'll carry her through amen now that Lazarus is resurrected guess what we don't know the rest of the story Lazarus could have died again before Martha and Mary because Lazarus would die again but now she's got something more than Lazarus Amen to depend on she knows who she believes in yeah she knows the word for her day she knows what God has done and that Revelation can carry her that did something for me on Wednesday it just blessed me to to know end to realize that God would allow a need to come in their life because he wants to do something greater than resurrect Lazarus he wants to awaken the seed inside of Martha amen listen God may want to do something greater than heal your body he may want to resurrect something inside of you he want to may want to bring some of his own virtues out of you and then when he heals you then you get a double benefit because you know you get sick again but this thing that's come to life inside of you and the trial it'll sustain you through the next one praise God let's turn to First Peter together 1 Peter chapter 1 first Peter chap 1 verse 6 wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it might be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ brother Braham says in the lean Church age he says but there is gold of God first Peter 17 refers to the same scripture that that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction amen that is the right kind of gold yeah say praise God Amen if you go to chapter 4 here 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you it's not strange it's God is God what's what's God trying to do why does a trial come why brother B tells us because the gold that comes through the trial is Christlike character what is Christlike character is the divine nature amen so what's the trials going to produce in our life more of the divine nature why because these Divine Natures are here to counteract or or to help us with a circumstance or situation that only this divine nature will get us through thank god let's turn to the Book of Job together let's go to job 23 job 23: 10 but he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold job knew that he was being tried but he also knew and believed that he would come forth as gold now gold when it comes from the earth it has impurities embedded in it and it needs to be purified and there's the purification process can be extreme heat high temperature it can be beating brother R told us the old days they would beat the smelter would beat the gold till it beat all of the dross out of it till it be purified I mean the reality is there's gold inside of each and every one of God's children right the gold is there but it needs to have the dross removed it needs to have the Earthly nature broke off of it it needs to be freed amen from whatever impurities are mixed in or holding it back or or contrary so that we get down to just the gold and what's going to do that in our lives firey trials man brother benam says in the message recognize your day in its message from 1964 he says job never recognized that it was God as long as the devil can make you believe something that that little trials you go through is is God punishing you it was God trying to show him something catch that it was God trying to show him something job never recognized it job never recognized it till he saw a vision like Moses when Moses saw the vision the pillar of fire in the bush it was Vindicated job in his question if a man dies can he live again I see a tree die and it lives again I see a flower die and it lives again that was his question but man layeth down he giveth up the ghost He wasteth away his sons come to mourn and he perceived it not oh that thou would hide me in the grave until the Wrath be passed he couldn't understand why a flower would die and live again how a leaf would go off of a tree down and lay on the ground and come back again in the spring he said man layeth down and and where does he go I believe God but what happens to a man but then one day the lightning began to flash the Thunders began to Roar the spirit Came Upon the prophet and he saw the coming of a man who could put his hand upon a sinful man and a holy God and Bridge the way then he screamed I know my redeemer liveth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I'll see God he recognized what the resurrection was what what a what a tremendous re ration that job received what a tremendous Revelation that he he now saw the coming of a redeemer he now saw somebody that could pay the price and bridge the gap he now knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that at the end time his Redeemer will live and he will live upon the Earth in his flesh he'll see his Redeemer amen how did he get to this Revelation going to church heard A good sermon no God had to break him down and break everything away from him because in many ways job had no need job was a great man in his community he was a leader he was super wealthy we've talked about this before but if you count the number of of donkeys he had and the number of camels he had you don't eat donkeys and you don't eat camels they are made for transporting of goods so he had a big trucking company am and he was moving Goods all over the this man was rich he was wealthy he was one of the greatest men of the East he had need of nothing but he had a question down in his heart and that question is what happens to a man when he dies yeah I see the flowers come back I see the trees come back but he's got a question that's troubling him down in his heart he's got a little doubt or a little question or something that he just can't reconcile in his heart and guess what God loves job so much that he's not going to let that little question stay in his heart but he's going to bring him a revelation Amen to answer the question but how does God bring the Revelation he's got to create a need in that man he's got to bring that man face to face with his question and what is his question where does a man go when he dies amen what happens his son's come and look at his grave and what goes on another man takes his estate and he's and why is he why is he coming face to face with this question because he's lost all of his children he's lost everything death is all around him amen and now he's severely Afflicted with boils amen all over his body and he's destitute he's Afflicted and he's ready to die and he's come face to face with the question what next yeah took away everything I've got all my children are dead my friends have forsaken me they're accusing me my life is in ruins my health is in shambles what next tell you what's next the greatest Revelation he ever received is what's next the revelation of the Resurrection The revelation of a redeemer the revelation of the fact that he's going to stand upon this Earth in his flesh though he goes to the grave and the skin worms destroy his flesh he's coming back again how did God bring it to him he made him face his deepest questions yeah what's God going to do for us let us keep trucking around with insecurities and complexes and questions in our heart and doubts floating around I say thank God for creating needs in our life so that he can come and bring us a revelation of his word because that Revelation overcomes and answers the questions amen praise God I I want to get super comfortable looking deep down inside of me yeah too many times we just Trucking through life we're just trying this and and we're putting on a facade and we're trying to be this super great this and we're a Christian and we're a message believer and we're walking around with an insecurity a question in our heart a doubt that's floating around not sure of who we are not sure uh completely Sly sure of the message not sure about this one or that one or this or that and we just keep going on like everything's fine I say God bring us to a need amen a need that'll bring us to a revelation amen and that revelation will answer the question so we stop living with a question in our heart amen and let God break everything down from around us to bring us a revelation that's what he did for Martha that's what he did for job and I said God Amen bring that divine nature out of me bring me a revelation Lord that's what we need friends we got to get comfortable facing ourselves looking ourselves in the mirror and saying saying why I struggle so bad with this why am I so tripped up with this why can't I seem to get over this why can't why can't I move past this Lord oh praise God let that become a need friends let that become a need say God what I need is Holy Ghost virtue I don't have anymore I can't keep trying to act like it doesn't bother me anymore it bothers me bothers me to the core of who I am it's a reality inside of me but it's got to go amen I need Holy Ghost virtue Holy Ghost knowledge I need I need a revelation that comes from you I need this thing gone out of my life so that you can express yourself in Me God brought job to the brink of death so that he had to face the question that was gnawing in his heart but God knew that there was gold inside of job God was never punishing job he wasn't upset with job he wanted job to reach his full potential he wanted job to get past the question amen I believe God wants us to get past the question we want we we have so many trials how many of you thought trials were going to go away I I mean I was foolish enough to think they were I mean I thought early on we'll get past this one and it'll be okay okay when we get past this one it'll be okay well you know what I come to the place where I'm I'm just comfortable with this one I'm not ready to move to the next one yet at least I know what I'm dealing with today because as soon as this one's gone you know the next one's on its path but what's God doing with all those trials he's bringing out his divine nature he's breaking us away from our own virtue and giving us his virtue that that's why I said it's dangerous to have a strong Constitution because if you have a strong Constitution and rely on that God's going to have to break you down pretty low pretty low if you've been gifted with a sharp mind God's going to have to break you down pretty low if you've got really good self-control God's going to have to really break that yeah because that's masking something he's got to get us to the place where we need not our Temperance but we need his Temperance we got to get to the place where we can no longer rely on our virtue but we need his virtue and the grace of God will bring us to those places friends he'll bring us to those places where we don't have the the strength we don't have the wisdom we don't have the answers we don't have anything so that we can come to the place where we're ready to say God I can't do it I don't know I don't understand I am confused I don't know which way to go and I don't know what the right answer is will you give me your knowledge I can't take another moment I'm about to crack will you give me your virtue I I can't control this urging inside of me if you don't help me I'm going to fall I need I don't need more of my willpower I need your Temperance in my life man too many times we try reformation and bucking up and trying harder and we'll we'll try new ways and new tactics of having more self-control right we'll have more strength you know we'll try to do things a little different so just fall on the Altar and be broken to pieces and say God I don't have enough self-control if you don't give me your self-control I'm not going to make it God I've come to the end of my patience I know you're I know your promises are true I know you'll answer my prayer I know but I just can't take the waiting any longer God I need your patience oh friends when we when we stop going in our own strength we stop running with our own legs and we start operating by the power of the Holy Ghost with the nature the divine nature of Jesus Christ It Changes Everything Changes Everything it gives us strength that we didn't know we had outside we're shambles but somehow we keep going people look at you say how is that person still going how do they get up in the morning how did I and they ask you how are you how are you doing it you've lost everything you've lost your family You've Lost Your Health you've lost how are you going you say I have no idea how I'm going it's not me going there's something inside of me keeps going you've been disappointed again how can you take another disappointment you've had so many disappointments and now you get knocked down once again how was it that you got back up and you went back to church how was it you went back to that place you say I have no idea I wanted to run away but the there was something in me that gave me the power to step back in to a hurtful situation again there was something that came up it wasn't me it was something inside of me pushing me amen like the little bubbling stream Amen brother brandham comes up to the stream in the winter he always likes to drink out of it it's always bubbling and always happy and he says why are you happy are you happy cuz the deer's come and drink from you no are you happy cuz I come and drink from no what makes you so happy he said it's something behind me bubbling up pushing me out oh that's the divine nature that's what we need we need to come to the end of every ability we've ever had and say God I've got to have your virtue your Temperance your patience your knowledge I need your godliness I have tried I have tried you know how many people say I tried to live the message I just can't live it that's that's because you need his godliness his godliness brings his Holiness his Holiness is his sanctification it's not you it's him inside of you that's why people feel restricted sometimes with the message they feel like it's restricting it's too tight hey you need some of his godliness and then you find out it's not restrictive it's life it's natural outflowing of the life of Jesus Christ we've tried too hard with our own intellect Our Own Strength our own understanding our our own patience so God keep creating need in me I don't want to be like the leoan church Rich increased with Goods have need of nothing all my ducks are in a row and my finances are lined up and I've got my job and my family is all this and we're fine it's better to realize we're not fine you ever wonder why every time you you get something secure God knocks the props out from under it you ever noticed that or is it just me every time you get a few nickel saved up and you think oh I got a month worth of savings and so now motor blows in the car transmission goes out it's gone why do you think God does that because I mean he could keep the transmission going but it's always just when you got enough right that all of a sudden it goes out and you say huh that's funny I've got enough money in the bank to pay it it didn't go out earlier and then everything it's gone again oh that's the grace of God in our lives amen don't ever want to get to where we don't have a need we don't want to ever get as a family we don't have a need as individuals as a church where we don't have a need we need to be needy let's turn to Psalms 51 Psalms 516 Psalms 51-6 behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom God wants truth in the inward parts that means he doesn't want us living with a lie or a question or something in our hearts but he wants to put truth there in the innermost being Amen brother bam we we know really well standing in the Gap I've preached on it many times in the last two years but he made this statement at the end he said but the call of God must come where whoever wants to March towards the promised land let him March we're on our road to the promised land amen let them come March we're on our road to meet Christ at the end time and I wanted to bring this to you so that you could see and show you that the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere so brother Bron made a mistake and he was going to depart the mystery he was going to leave and he was going to trick his wife into going away and he was going to do all that but he was being sincere it wasn't insincerity that made him do that he was sincere but he was wrong but what made him do that a rejection complex a rejection complex so what did God do God made him face his rejection complex God didn't let him run away God didn't let him go up to Northern British Colombia God called him out on it and he had made up plans because he was hurt he was hurt because they didn't hear his ministry he was hurt because his friends rejected him he he had sacrificed his life he had done so much and now in the offense he comes up with a plan where he's he's going to to run away to Northern British Columbia and trick his wife and you know the whole story but it's amazing how God God won't let the prophet get get by with it he makes him face it he has to come face to face with it and here's what he says says Moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother Rory you see your dream and now I cannot go with a Ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it no matter if God did tell me but that is the change that brother Roy that's see coming something's got to change me because I in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they ought to have heard the message they ought to have done him and I don't have the feeling for the people that I should have until I can get that feeling there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite and all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart and I won't go out there being a hypocrite I got to feel that that isn't Ricky and Retta and it isn't a this Bunch it's God's children children that's in bondage and I must go to them I love this because God told him you're wrong said if you do that you'll become a bum your wife won't stay up there with you and and God you know brought him to the mountain peak and showed him his life and showed him your commission your commission with greater gifts than these and you're to pray for the sick you're to do all these other things and he got he got his commission from God he knew what God told him to do but yet God wants truth on the inner parts is that true God wants truth from the inward Parts brother B said I know where I'm wrong and I know what I got to do to be right but I can't go till God fixes this inside what was he heard about he was heard at rejection because they didn't listen to him and we know that rejection pain comes from way back in his life all the way back from a childhood when he was rejected so here's more rejection pain on top of rejection pain and here he comes and and he has a natural human reaction to it and the human reaction is get away from the pain that's a human reaction to pain is get away from the pain but that's not God's solution God tells him I've called you to this you have no Escape Route and God makes him face it again I say God help us face whatever it is that's tripping us up help us to face it with reality and brother Brandon wasn't just smoothing it over and saying okay now I was wrong I know what I got to do and I go he still offended in his heart he still has this feeling in his heart and he said I know I I can't go out feeling this way even if God did tell me I can't go I've always served god with an honest heart oh praise God you know what that's to me such a such a blessing because now this Prophet had to stay in prayer and he had to trust in God until God supplied something he could not supply himself God had to bring some virtue God had to bring some healing God had to give him uh some brotherly love amen God had to give him some perfect love because perfect love is the one who who hung on the cross with all of his all of his Brethren rejecting him all of them mocking him and walking by and stripped him naked and hung him to the cross and making fun of him and he said father for forgive them they don't know what they do you know what that is that's charity that's love that's the capf stone you know what brother brandham need he needed Holy Ghost charity so that he could go back to his Brethren and he said I can't go until I get this feeling out well you have you ever tried to get a feeling out of your heart if you've been successful come and see me because I I have tried I pretended it's not there right I've just moved on and act like it everything was fine you you can't just get a feeling out of your heart you need God to come on the scene and God to bring some of his holy ghost virtue in Amen to bring his virtue his love his brotherly kindness he's got to bring his patience so that you can go back and say and his knowledge so you can say it's not my brother brother B said it's never your brother it's never your sister it's always the devil that gets between you know what we need we need some holy ghost knowledge to Lift Us high enough so that we can see that reality cuz we get down in our own knowledge and we say they did this for that reason and they did this for this reason and we got but we got to get lifted higher till we see what the prophet saw and say it's never your brother your sister it's always the devil that's getting in between and then when you can go and say it's not my brother it's not my sister it's the devil trying to separate us you can go right back in the action because you got a holy ghost knowledge amen when you get to the place where from the bottom of your heart you can say father forgive them they don't know they don't know how bad that hurt me like I can see that they really don't know and they didn't do it on purpose and when God gives you that kind of love you can go right back into action friends but until then we have to be real genuine we have to have truth in the inward Parts it's good to say I'm not healed yet there's no shame in saying I'm still dealing with this and I need God to come do what I can't do myself listen there's no shame in that friends we got to get to where the Prophet was and be honest and serve God from an honest heart say God I I'm still struggling I'm still hurt I need whatever you had on the cross I need you to put that in me whatever you love you had whatever patience you had whatever brotherly love you had when you were nailed that cross I need you to activate that in me because I don't have the power in my flesh to make this work listen friends if we had the power in our flesh to make it work we would have just changed our mind we could have jerked the feeling out of our heart and threw it on the ground and stomped on it and said but we can't we need something more say thank God for needs cuz needs will produce the Son of God what did the trial what did the trial Daniel went through produce It produced God in his trial when he went to the Lions then the pillar of fire come in why because he couldn't do it himself what about the three Hebrew children what did their trial produce It produced One like to the Son of God walking in their midst amen what will your trial produce if you let it produce do something it'll bring God on the scene it'll bring the Life of Christ on the scene it's the only thing that can overcome nothing else can self-help psychology none of it's going to work it's going to take Christ it's going to take him bringing his divine nature listen if you get a dose of perfect love it'll be okay what do you mean but no matter what anybody's done to you no matter what offense no matter what trial no matter what hurt if you get a dose of perfect love it'll be okay because perfect love was what was nailed to the cross saying father forgive them they don't know what they do it was perfect love that on the day of Pentecost when 5,000 were born again Jesus didn't say uhuh no no no no they they questioned me they weren't there to defend me when I was on the cross they even sided with the other side and thought that I was wrong no it didn't matter what they had done before amen the day of Pentecost when 5000 and it says and many priests and Levites the priests and Levites who wouldn't come to him the priest and Levites who wouldn't give him support the priests and Levites were part of that group that were condemning him they came to him he never said no no no you don't know what they did to me what was that perfect love don't ever think I'll never get over this I'll never forgive I'll never be free don't you dare think that you get a dose of perfect love in your heart and it'll be okay friends you get some brotherly kindness in your heart and it doesn't matter what your brother said doesn't matter what he did if you get Holy Ghost brotherly kindness in your heart it'll be okay if we're having a hard time getting over things you know what we need Holy Ghost virtue Faith Temperance love we need the divine nature you know what I don't think that our trials are going to end anytime soon because I don't think we've all come to the stature of a perfect man completely yet have you is anybody here have all the virtues is working perfectly in your life right now you've come oh well then that means you're going to have a need that means you're going to need more Temperance somewhere along the way you're going to need more virtue you're going to need more love you're going to need more brotherly kindness well if you recognize that you have a need then well fasten your seat belt here's here's job I want to I want to end with this if I could just wrap up with these last few lines let's look at Job 40 go back to the Book of Job God took job through this whole trial and like we said before it's so multifaceted we can never you can never say God did this with job for this reason that may be one of the reasons but you can't make it definitive God was doing so many things at the same time we'll never understand it he was he was showing he was showing what a Son of God was to Satan he was he was maybe doing something to correct his friends I don't know what all he was doing but we know one of the things he was doing was answering a question that was trapped in job's heart and so God brings job through this trial and he does everything that he's going to do and he gets to the end of the trial and and and job failed at the end of this trial because he began to say I haven't done anything wrong I don't know why God's allowing this to happen if I could just go talk to him I would settle I would settle because this isn't right and let's look at verse one job 41 moreover the Lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer it job had been saying to his friends I've done nothing wrong I don't know why God's doing this this isn't righteous this isn't fair this isn't right that's what he's basically been saying and now God comes on the scene and it's funny how job answers then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile first words out of his mouth behold I am vile oh God help me to realize without him how vile I am to think that I know better than God or I know what God's doing or I know what God should do or I know what God's doing in somebody else's life or I know what they should do I am vile only God knows that behold I am vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my mouth once have I spoken but I will not answer yay twice but I will proceede no further then answered the Lord unto job out of the Whirlwind and said gir up thy loins now like a man I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me Willl thou also diseno my judgment will thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous my oh my I think it's good to say we don't know nothing it's better just to say I don't know anything I can't do anything right and I have no idea what God's doing but I trust him and I love him and everything he does is perfect I got faith in him but for me to explain to you what he's doing I don't know why he's doing I don't know I'm not God he's so much higher than we are job 42:7 and it was so that after the Lord had spoken these words unto job the Lord said unto elifaz the timite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for he hath not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath therefore take unto you now seven Bullocks and seven Rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will I accept lest I deal with you after your Folly and that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job amen the reason that I put this in here is God took job through a terrible trial yes and job got broke down but in his breaking down he got the tremendous revelation of the resurrection and the Redemption then he began to get correction because he began to say things that weren't right and in his correction God put him in his place and job repented he repented because he was really rep and he realized how wrong he was but you know what no matter what happened in the trial and the beat down and the friends and his own error and his correction it never changed what God thought about joben now at the end of it all God says you three who said things you shouldn't have had you didn't speak properly like my servant job it's like what you just corrected him yeah and he says you go take seven Bullocks go to him and have him pray for you for him will I accept through it all guess what job was still a Son of God from the beginning to the end in the mistake and the beat down and everything with the question in his heart with the question that need answered with the troubles and the trials and his own false speaking his own wrong speaking and accusing God he was always the Son of God God never changed his mind about job and guess what no matter how many trials we come and no matter how many times we come to the end of ourselves and find out we've been relying on some false fleshly thing but we need the reality from God it doesn't matter if you do that 10 times 20 times 30 times 100 times you'll always be a Son of God Amen that's why God dealt with job because he was a son that's why God answered his question because he was a son that's why he took him through all of it because he wanted the gold that was in job to be refined God doesn't want your virtue he doesn't want your Temperance amen he doesn't want your patience he doesn't want your brotherly kindness he wants the gold that's inside of you to be refined and everything natural to be broke off so the reality from Christ can be made manifest his is better than ours remember Abraham even in Abraham's eror when he goes down to guar and lies about his wife and all of that and all the things that transpired and so many reasons for that possibly but Abraham never stopped being a Son of God it was aimc who was wronged who had to go to Abraham God never changed his mind about us friends amen just because we find ourselves maybe like the prophet one day with a reeling from a complex and hurt pulling back and wanting to run away and discouraged and hurt towards brothers and sisters or just because you find yourself in that place doesn't change anything about your position with God you're still a Son of God you always were a Son of God listen trials testing and trials are not about grades it's not about pass and fail it's not about how did you do on your last Dr I got an 80 I got an 85 has nothing to do with that friends listen you already made the Honor role your name's in the Lamb's Book of Life you're on the dean list doesn't matter how many times you fail your trial you're already on the Dean's List it's not about pass or fail it's about God molding us into his image and breaking everything else away from us you say well yeah I just had another trial I just messed up again well praise God you messed up again so Christ can manifest himself in a greater way in you praise God we found out we need him more praise God somewhere else in my life I come to the end of my ability I crashed again with no Temperance I crashed again with little patience I crashed again with no more virtue well praise God now you can have his virtue and his Temperance and his patience praise almighty God Amen what God wants friends is preeminence he wants preeminence how can he take preeminence when we're still holding on to things yes how can he have all of our heart if we still have things in our heart God's got to work it out and listen I know we can't work it out of ourselves we don't have the ability sometimes we don't even know what it is we just know something's troubling us we know we just keep getting trouble we keep falling into the same trap we keep getting hurt by the same set of circumstances we don't even know what it is we need God to do what he did for job we need God to do what he did for the prophet of God for brother Brandon we need to we need God to break everything down till we come face to face with the thing that's bothering us amen until we can be real about it and repent and say God I I need you to change something in me so that I can keep going I'm not just going to keep going I need you to change something in me so that I can keep going listen friends this message is real it's the power of transformation it's not fictitious just talking about fanciful things it is the power to bring his life inside of you amen his word into man estation his very divine nature living inside of you but we've he's a gentleman and we've got to let some things go we've got to face some things when he brings it back around till we face it again let's face it and be honest about it and say God I'm failing here I don't have the strength and I don't have this or that I need you to grant me your very own life because I'm I'm finished and then watch the power of God by the power of the Holy Ghost come and work in our life and begin to root those things out of our life friends oh I'm so thankful we serve a risen savior who's alive today and working today because his desires to have preeminence in you and I I want him to have preeminence brother B says and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said when I think of it I just see denomination pass off the scene and everything else just going see when I see God's Great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading thank God Amen brother mam says in in the message it is the rising of the sun said did you get that see our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not boost some church or make more in the Sunday school or try to bring in hog tie push and offer a picnic party or bring Stars buttons or something else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified not with self- pride but in us our lives to prove he is alive and living in us if I can get myself out of the way so when William Brandon not even thought of and you not even thought of till we can see Jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire gives us the quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the Bride of him and seeing his same Vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead oh praise be to God if I can just get all of me out of the way and then he can live his life his divine nature through me then then you say you know brother how did you make it through that trial listen brother I didn't make it through the child he made it through me they asked brother Brandon brother BR how did you hold on when you lost your mom your dad and you lost your brother you lost your wife you lost your baby he said I didn't hold on he held on to me this was the man who tried to commit suicide twice who cried himself to sleep at night amen he made it through but he didn't make it through because he wanted to kill himself who made it through Christ made it through through him who got Glory not William Brandon because he come to the end of himself we come to the end of ourselves and God steps in God gets the glory cuz we can be honest and say no listen I couldn't do it I couldn't take it another day I was I was quitting I was in the process of quitting I was telling God I was quitting instead of I'm quitting coming out of my mouth it came out of my mouth God have your way with me where did that come from that was him am praise be to God again in Christ is the mystery he said oh if God can get him prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence you see he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but Christ you get what I mean all right that's secondly first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them man let's all stand together if God is going to have the preeminence friends if he's going to have the preeminence then it's going to be his faith that has preeminence his virtue not yours and mine his temperence his longsuffering his patience if he's going to have the preeminence it's going to have to be his life not mine I'm going to have to realize how needy I am how broken I am how vile I am and how perfect he is you know what's so exciting is we don't live in the day of partial friends we live in the day of full realization God wants to use us to display his nature God wants to work in our lives God wants to do for us what only he can do for us so God in his Mercy he creates conditions that only his nature can Prevail against God brings us into circumstances that only his virtue will work only his Temperance only his patience only his brotherly kindness ours won't work and that is the grace of God to bring us into those circumstances where only his divine nature will work and that gives us the opportunity to crash ourselves at his feet and say God I throw in the towel I tried all I know to try and I'm I'm here again but God let your divine nature Minister Let Your Divine Nature overcome and so then the Overcomer is not you you're the surrenderer he's the Overcomer amen musicians if you'd make your way up brother Ben if you'll come let's just bow our heads and pray dear heavenly Lord Jesus we thank you Father God we're so grateful to you Lord that you know you know how weak we are we you know the Fallen nature we were born with so God you came and you purged us you cleansed Us by your own blood so that you could bring your life in your nature inside of us God you knew we couldn't make it on our own so you provided your life for us oh God I pray you'd come now fill us aresh with your spirit and begin to manifest your nature through us God I pray you'd help us to surrender to everything that we thought were strength in our lives may we just throw them down at your altar now may we break the idols of our own virtue and our own strength and our own Constitution and our own knowledge may we break those Idols at your feet Lord and may we humbly ask you for your virtue and your knowledge and your Temperance and your brotherly kindness and your love for that's the only one that will work Lord God we thank you for everything you've done in our lives we thank you God for a prophet who was honest told us the truth and told us what was going on in his heart so that we could be real and honest too so that we could recognize Lord that in our heart we're not right but we want to be right Lord in our heart we're struggling to be free and we can't be on our own Lord God I pray you would come come by your spirit and you'd pour the bomm of Gilead in and heal our broken hearts Would You Deliver Us Lord from the things that have troubled us so much from complexes and insecurities and troubles that have lasted a lifetime would you come and make us whole Lord God we've tried to use our strength and we failed we tried to use our love and we failed well we tried our patience and we failed we tried our Temperance and we failed in every way we failed but God your nature will never fail and Lord you've made it available to us it's by promise that this is the hour Lord and we raise our hands to receive from you that portion that you've allotted for us in this hour may you fill us with the fullness of your Holy Ghost and may you come and draw out the life that you put inside of us bring your faith your Temperance Lord your patience your brotherly kindness Your Love God if you would just bring Lord your own love it would heal everything Lord it would give us the power and the strength your power your strength to face our trials to face our questions to see them answered by a revelation Lord God those who are here Lord have struggled God may they recognize that the struggle is good may they be grateful for the struggle that they didn't just go on like the leot Church age rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but God may they realize may you help all of us realize that we are needy Lord that we cannot do it that we're just going to fail again we're going to pick ourselves up and try to go on but we're just going to fail again Lord would you come heal our broken hearts and bring your nature so that we're not running in our own strength we're running in your strength so we're not flying by our own power we're flying by your power Lord so they're not overcoming in our own strength and our own will we're Overcoming By your virtue God we surrender to you have preeminence in us real preeminence we don't want you to have a shared space with any complex a shared space with any of our own strength Lord we want to empty out now and get ourselves out of the way so that you can come and do things in us we've never thought possible so that we can forgive that we can love that we can reach out in ways we never thought possible so that we can keep pressing on when we don't feel like it when we' come to the end may you give us a supernatural power to keep pressing on May you give us a supernatural patience to wait for your word to come to manifestation may it be you and not us Lord bless your people I pray that you would do the surgery that only you can do what you've done in the prophet what you did in job what you did in all of us Lord would you do it would you continue to do it tell everything is rooted out and you have preeminence in us God we want to see you glorified glorified because you're the only one that can overcome in this age you're the only one that can believe the message you're the only one that can act on it you're the only one that can live it would you come and live it through US Lord we love you I ask that you'd bless your people as we part May the word that's gone forth do the work you intended for it to do unhindered by the work of the enemy may you bring deliverance and strength and healing and may you provide your power that we might live we love you father and we ask your blessing in Jesus Christ's name we pray Amen to be like Jesus to be be like Jesus on Earth I Lord to be [Music] like all through life's journey from Earth to Glory glories I only am to be like one more time to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I to be [Music] like all through life's journey from Earth to GL I [Music] amen is if God's working in your heart just let him work you can pray don't rush him just let him work you can come and pray at the altar you're welcome to come and pray at your seats let God do the work that he's wanting to doen let him let him bring his life into us I confess I want to be like Jesus but I can't I know you want to be like Jesus but you can't either it's better just to come to terms with it you can't do it I can't do it it's going to have to be him doing it he's going to have to bring us if you've not come to the New Birth you need Christ to awaken that life inside of you you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and those of you who had who still wrestling with a white dog and a black dog we need the white dog to win we need Christ to do things in us that we cannot do ourselves we need his power his life his love we need just a greater surrender is all we need we need a greater recognition of how needy we really are because we've been called bride Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday and it's all true there's nothing wrong with it but we can get the term to think I'm secure and I'm fine but when it comes to the spiritually when it comes to your soul fine that's your destination it's sealed your name has been sealed in the L's book of life but when it comes to your heart when it comes to this life there's still work that needs to be done inside of me I want this flesh to be surrendered to be washed out to be emptied out to be healed so that he can manifest that life through me don't just think I'm okay when in your heart you know you're not okay you know you're not free you know you're bound up you know that you need virtue you need strength you need love you need something more because whatever you have is on empty whatever you have has failed multiple times don't just keep trucking through when you hear a servant like this say God that's there's a need inside of me that I cannot fix I need you amen I'm just going to invite you to pray you can be dismissed as you need to be you can go just go quietly may God bless us may God heal us may God restore us may God manifest his life through us you know what he needs empty vessels I want to be empty empty of all what I thought were strength empty him what I thought were false empty them too the good things empty it the bad things EMP just empty it all out so that he can come and live himself inside of me God bless you friends let's sing this song Heal Me Oh Lord and I will be [Music] here save me and I will be saved
