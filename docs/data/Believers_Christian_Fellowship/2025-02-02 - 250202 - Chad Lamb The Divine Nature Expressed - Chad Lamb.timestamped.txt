[22:54] Greg you and brother Chuck you guys are

[23:06] amen so we just appreciate everybody
[23:09] praying and thankful that he's there
[23:11] he's going to come back uh he's going to
[23:13] fly back sometime this next week he's
[23:15] going to load a van again on Friday and
[23:17] uh he and his family then will be uh
[23:19] driving back to Washington DC to stay
[23:22] there so just keep him in prayer there's
[23:23] a lot of back and forth and a lot of
[23:25] things he's got to do amen
[23:28] so let's look to to this subject here um
[23:33] uh let's turn what we we read here that
[23:35] we are to come into a perfect man un the
[23:37] measure of the stature of the fullness
[23:39] of Christ and we believe we're in that
[23:41] age according to the prophecy and
[23:42] according to the word that God is going
[23:45] to fully reveal himself in Bride form
[23:48] we're going to come as a bride into that
[23:51] full stature into that perfect man and I
[23:54] just like to know I I know so many of
[23:55] you know it we've talked about so many
[23:57] times but when we say perfect man we
[23:59] don't mean
[24:00] Flawless it's not the word flawless man
[24:03] the only way that we are flawless is
[24:05] we're Flawless by the Redemption Act of
[24:08] the blood of Jesus Christ and that makes
[24:10] us perfect and Flawless but this word
[24:13] perfect means fully mature or completed
[24:15] it's a finished work it's come to what
[24:17] God wants it to be and when we look at
[24:19] this we're going to come into a perfect
[24:21] man if we don't understand that he's
[24:22] talking about full maturity or
[24:24] completion then we start thinking but I
[24:26] still have flaws and I still have this
[24:28] and listen brother Benham said we have a
[24:29] sticky caer nature that's going to
[24:31] bother us as long as we're in it as long
[24:33] as we're in this world he said and so
[24:36] we've got to get past that and
[24:37] understand that this word that's been
[24:39] given to us and the Holy Ghost has been
[24:41] released to us in this age is to bring
[24:43] us into a perfect man unto the measure
[24:46] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[24:49] let's turn over to Second Peter together
[24:52] and read about this statue of a perfect
[24:54] man this divine
[24:56] nature in second
[25:07] Peter second
[25:10] Peter um chapter
[25:15] 1 verse
[25:18] three according as his divine power has
[25:20] given unto us all things that pertain un
[25:22] to life and godliness through the
[25:24] knowledge of him that ha called us to
[25:26] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[25:30] us exceeding great and precious promises
[25:32] that by these you might be partakers of
[25:34] the divine nature having escaped the
[25:37] corruption that is in the world through
[25:39] lust and beside this giving all
[25:41] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[25:44] div virtue knowledge into knowledge
[25:46] Temperance into Temperance patience and
[25:48] patience godliness and godliness
[25:50] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[25:52] kindness charity for if these things be
[25:55] in you and abound they make you that you
[25:57] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[26:00] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[26:03] Christ amen so we know that this is
[26:05] going to be given to us by A Promise by
[26:08] a precious promise this is not this is
[26:11] not something that we are going to work
[26:12] our way into as far as striving and
[26:16] climbing into it of our own effort but
[26:18] this is a promise that's God given to us
[26:20] that we can be a partaker of this divine
[26:22] nature and we're going to be a partaker
[26:24] by the promise of God working in our
[26:26] life by the power of the spirit of God
[26:27] working in us and so I want to uh read
[26:30] this quote out a statue of a perfect man
[26:32] brother vam says uh Peter is saying here
[26:35] how that we must be partakers of his
[26:37] divine nature now each one of us are
[26:39] trying to grow into the stature of God
[26:43] Amen is that what we're trying to do
[26:45] grow into the stature of God Amen and
[26:48] and so when he says we're trying to grow
[26:49] into the stature of God to me it looks
[26:51] like a process amen that we're growing
[26:53] God's growing us into that perfect man
[26:56] un the fullness of the statue of Christ
[26:59] and here he says the stature of God and
[27:01] so I just want to speak on that for a
[27:03] little bit this morning amen I I stand
[27:07] Here confessing to you that I'm
[27:09] absolutely weak because I had a horrible
[27:11] day yesterday praise God it's not
[27:15] because anybody did anything it's
[27:16] because I strived and strived and
[27:18] strived all day for inspiration and
[27:20] nothing came and it was
[27:23] miserable I don't know if you've ever
[27:25] been there but if you've been there you
[27:26] know what I mean it's one of the most
[27:28] miserable feelings in the world you Pace
[27:30] the floor you pray I come in here and
[27:32] pray I go back to my office and pray I
[27:34] read I whatever you know turn on music
[27:37] sing a little bit and feel pretty good
[27:39] and go write a scripture down and then
[27:41] nothing
[27:44] Fizzles but this morning as I was laying
[27:46] in bed I I I opened my eyes early and I
[27:50] said I don't want to get up and I closed
[27:52] my eyes again as I was laying there
[27:54] closing my eyes God started putting
[27:55] pieces together for me and I just say I
[27:58] know somebody was praying and I just say
[28:00] thank you amen you can't we can't do
[28:02] this by ourselves there's not a one of
[28:04] us that can do this by ourselves it it
[28:07] takes all of us depending on God we have
[28:09] confidence that God's placed gifts in
[28:11] our in our church and placed gifts in
[28:12] different one but those gifts operate as
[28:15] we pull on them amen and as we all come
[28:17] together and so I know there was many of
[28:19] you over here praying on Saturday I
[28:21] watched as you come and go and it
[28:23] encourages me so much and I know that
[28:25] you were praying last night and this
[28:26] morning and I believe God is going to
[28:28] answer those prayers so I'm going to do
[28:31] my very best this morning just to relax
[28:32] and get out of the way and let God work
[28:35] and you just pulled and see what God has
[28:37] for you because I don't have anything
[28:39] for you amen but God has something for
[28:43] you I've never seen him gather his
[28:45] children together and not feed them I've
[28:47] never seen him fail to feed his sheep
[28:49] when he's called them together and
[28:51] United them together and I have
[28:53] confidence in that and so I'm just
[28:55] praying that God will help me to relax
[28:57] myself and get out of the way so we know
[29:00] that God is calling us to express this
[29:04] divine nature and we know we know beyond
[29:07] a shadow of a doubt we're in that hour
[29:09] because of the prophetic message that
[29:10] we' received so we're not in an hour
[29:13] that we're hoping that we can be and be
[29:15] more like Christ and but but we're not
[29:17] in Luther's day we're not in Wesley's
[29:19] day we're not here in a partial
[29:20] fulfillment we're not here under a dip
[29:23] in the Holy Ghost but we are here under
[29:25] the fullness of everything the full word
[29:27] has been rest restor the fullness of the
[29:29] spirit has come back into the church to
[29:31] bring the full word into manifestation
[29:33] we're not dwelling in the era of
[29:35] partiality we now know the full
[29:38] potential is here it is all here and
[29:41] we're not striving for another age we're
[29:42] not waiting for future events we have
[29:45] come to that time we have come to the
[29:46] climax of The Gentile Church we've come
[29:48] to the climax of the of the dispensation
[29:51] of the Gentiles climaxing in a bride and
[29:55] that Bride is a people that he has
[29:57] gathered by predestination to himself
[29:59] that he is going to fill with himself
[30:02] and he is going to manifest himself
[30:03] through them so that it becomes Christ
[30:06] in Bride
[30:07] form Christ clothed in the clothing of
[30:11] his bride it's like a patchwork quilk
[30:13] you're a patch and I'm a patch and we're
[30:15] all a patch but inside is
[30:18] Christ that's the age that we're in and
[30:21] so now we know that we don't have to if
[30:24] I could say this way we don't have to
[30:26] settle for partial
[30:28] we shouldn't be settling for partial and
[30:31] neither can we Strongarm things in with
[30:34] with the when it comes to
[30:36] God and well did I learn that yesterday
[30:38] I can't force God to give me
[30:40] inspiration I can't arm wrestle him I
[30:43] can't demand it I can't I'm utterly
[30:45] dependent on God we cannot Strongarm God
[30:48] into anything God is Sovereign and does
[30:49] as he wishes as he needs for whatever
[30:52] purpose he needs to manifest
[30:54] himself and so we we we we do Do not sit
[30:59] back and just say you know whatever will
[31:02] be will be maybe in the fut no this is
[31:04] the day this is the day for a people on
[31:08] the Earth to manifest Christ this is the
[31:10] day amen for a people to be surrendered
[31:12] to be sold out to be dead to themselves
[31:15] to have the Life of Christ Living inside
[31:17] because God has brought the full
[31:19] potential back into his bride so we're
[31:22] growing into that that nature but we're
[31:25] not listen we should never be waiting
[31:27] for something else we should be taking
[31:29] advantage of what God's given us
[31:31] understanding I can't Strongarm anything
[31:33] out of God or force him to do anything
[31:35] all I can do is continually surrender
[31:37] and believe and ask and pray and and and
[31:40] wait on the Lord knowing that this is
[31:43] the
[31:44] hour and there's another knowing that we
[31:46] need to have we need to know that this
[31:48] is the hour that's wonderful this is the
[31:49] hour of full potential everything's been
[31:51] released but I also must know amen by a
[31:55] personal meeting with God himself that
[31:57] I'm part of that
[31:58] program because if I don't know that I'm
[32:00] part of that program we can say yeah
[32:02] everything's been restored the word's
[32:03] been restored the spirits here full but
[32:05] I still am questioning my part of the
[32:07] program we're never going to come to
[32:09] full maturity until we can settle the
[32:12] question I know that God's called me and
[32:15] we can look in the mirror and say I'm a
[32:16] million miles from what I ought to be
[32:18] and I he shouldn't have called me we can
[32:20] say all of those things looking at the
[32:22] human perspective but we've got to get
[32:24] down and say but God has done something
[32:26] inside of me amen he's connected me to
[32:29] this word amen and I believe
[32:31] it so I can't help it it's just the way
[32:34] it
[32:35] is and so then I believe that that full
[32:38] potential that is here is to bring
[32:41] me into the stature of Christ
[32:45] me me into a perfect
[32:48] man
[32:50] amen praise
[32:52] God in in the message identification he
[32:55] says oh no no other nature could do this
[32:59] no cuz he was molded the perfect
[33:02] character of God for it was a fallen
[33:05] character that all nature had all men
[33:07] had a fallen character even everything
[33:10] that was under man fell everything had
[33:12] got a dying character and he had a
[33:14] living character so he expressed it in
[33:17] Christ and he paid the price so it
[33:22] Christ came to be that living character
[33:24] of God to display God on this Earth
[33:29] but we all came with a fallen character
[33:32] yes because we came under man we came
[33:35] under the fall and we look in uh this uh
[33:38] questions and answers on Hebrews brother
[33:40] B says now let's take let's let's take
[33:44] back to
[33:45] Cain could you tell me where that spirit
[33:48] and that meanness come from Cain look if
[33:51] Cain was the son of Adam which was a Son
[33:54] of God where did that evil come from the
[33:56] first thing when he was born born he
[33:58] hated he was a murderer he was jealous
[34:01] and now take the nature of his daddy the
[34:03] very start in the beginning Lucifer in
[34:05] the beginning he was jealous of Michael
[34:08] what started the whole trouble how many
[34:09] knows that and Cain was the nature of
[34:11] his father which he was jealous of his
[34:14] brother and slew him see that nature
[34:16] could not have come of that pure seed it
[34:19] had to come out of this perverted
[34:21] stream so we know that that First John 3
[34:25] tells us that Cain was of the wicked one
[34:28] so Satan had found a way to inject his
[34:31] nature into
[34:33] humanity and he did it through through
[34:35] the Fall In the Garden of Eden and then
[34:37] we know that through the intermingling
[34:39] and the fall of Man everybody comes with
[34:42] a fallen
[34:43] nature and so we struggle with that
[34:46] Fallen nature brother vanam said in 1964
[34:49] in questions and answers he said this is
[34:51] a dying spirit and a dying body but now
[34:54] you can't be in two bodies at one time
[34:56] but there can be two natur's in you at
[34:58] one
[35:00] time if there wasn't if that wasn't the
[35:03] case what are we struggling with what
[35:05] are we fighting with why are we
[35:07] struggling what are we
[35:08] overcoming remember brother bam told the
[35:10] story we we read it here a few weeks ago
[35:13] of the Indian chief who got born again
[35:15] was baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[35:16] somebody asked him how are you doing he
[35:18] said Sometimes good sometimes bad said
[35:20] what do you mean he said since I've got
[35:22] the Holy Ghost there's two dogs fighting
[35:24] in me black dog and a white dog and and
[35:28] and you know they they asked him the
[35:29] question which one wins he said which
[35:31] one I feed the most and brother benam
[35:32] made the comment he says see it depends
[35:34] on which n nature you cater
[35:38] to and so you know we had old ideas
[35:42] before the message I remember as a boy
[35:44] we had these old ideas that the baptism
[35:47] of the Holy Ghost cured everything every
[35:49] the struggle was over amen and and
[35:51] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[35:52] you're absolutely a new creature but
[35:54] what's a new creature the Inside Man the
[35:57] outside man yet is not a new creature
[35:59] he's coming subject to the Inside Man
[36:01] and must be put uh must be put under our
[36:04] feet yeah he must be made subject but
[36:07] yet he's still there amen and that's why
[36:10] we're still striving for a change in the
[36:13] atoms that's why we're still striving to
[36:15] be clothed upon with a Heavenly Body and
[36:17] with a glorified body to have the right
[36:19] Spirit and the right body and the right
[36:22] soul all uni unified together so that
[36:24] the struggle is
[36:26] over we're still longing for that even
[36:29] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[36:30] what the Holy Ghost has done is given us
[36:32] a power and a strength that we never had
[36:34] before amen and it unlock the nature
[36:37] that was in the SE Gene of God to start
[36:39] manifesting the life of God under the
[36:42] anointing of the Holy Ghost amen but
[36:44] there's two Natures there can be two
[36:46] Natures in us at once and it depends on
[36:48] which one we cater
[36:50] to I said God help me to stop catering
[36:53] to the wrong one I'm tired of getting
[36:56] bit by the black dog yeah I got teeth
[36:59] marks all over me and I'm sick of it
[37:03] amen but but somehow through old habits
[37:07] and through and through distractions and
[37:09] through the tantalizing Temptations of
[37:12] the world we keep throwing bones to the
[37:14] old black
[37:16] dog every once in a while we throw him a
[37:18] steak and he gets too strong and yeah my
[37:22] desire is to starve that guy to
[37:25] death and so we find out then now this
[37:29] is the state that we're in because of
[37:31] the fall and so from the very beginning
[37:35] brother B said God's desire was to dwell
[37:37] among men and dwell in men and among men
[37:40] and have his family of God upon the
[37:43] Earth that's what he desired at the
[37:44] beginning to have this perfect world and
[37:47] to dwell with his family a family of God
[37:49] in Fellowship together upon the face of
[37:51] the Earth but Satan found a way to to he
[37:56] found a way to inject part of his nature
[37:58] through the serpent into man so he could
[38:01] have access to man yeah so that he could
[38:05] he could circumvent God's plan but you
[38:08] never stop God's plan because God
[38:09] foresaw all things before the foundation
[38:11] of the world and God was going to make a
[38:13] way where he could dwell in man amen he
[38:16] was going to do so by the by the price
[38:18] of redemption that was
[38:20] paid but when we come to Jesus now we're
[38:24] coming to a man that's not born with a
[38:26] fallen nature
[38:28] right he was virgin born in the message
[38:31] hear ye him brother B said but the Bible
[38:33] said there was no beauty that we should
[38:35] desire him probably a little bitty fella
[38:38] stooped in the shoulder or something we
[38:40] all hit as it were our faces from him
[38:43] there never was a character like it like
[38:45] that that's that real man is you don't
[38:48] measure a man's muscle but by the bags
[38:50] of the knees and his pants where he's
[38:51] been praying that's the way you measure
[38:53] a man by
[38:55] character there was never a character
[38:57] like Jesus Christ he wasn't born with
[39:00] the wrong
[39:01] character he was born with the character
[39:03] of
[39:04] God Amen and we find that the battle
[39:08] from the beginning has been a battle
[39:10] over Dominion yeah it's been a battle
[39:14] over
[39:15] rulership who will rule the
[39:18] Earth amen and we find in ourselves that
[39:22] we're in the midst of this
[39:24] battle because the battle raging today
[39:27] is Raging on this lump of earth right
[39:30] here and there's two factions Waring and
[39:34] they want they want to have preeminence
[39:36] they want to have dominion over this
[39:37] lump of the earth amen and the battle
[39:40] the greatest battle is going being
[39:41] fought in our minds so and what's it for
[39:45] the battle is is being fought for
[39:47] control who's going to
[39:50] control the the Devil is a
[39:54] usurper he is a he's a dictator he's a
[39:58] usurper he's a
[40:01] manipulator but Christ is a
[40:05] gentleman so the devil in order to have
[40:07] control he will manipulate he will force
[40:10] he will persuade he will do all kinds of
[40:13] manner of evil and and he'll use fear
[40:16] he'll use manipulation he'll use
[40:18] whatever he can use to try to gain
[40:22] Dominion but Christ he's a gentleman he
[40:26] doesn't manipulate he doesn't control he
[40:29] doesn't persuade he doesn't use fear all
[40:32] he does is throw out his
[40:34] word and he waits for somebody to yield
[40:38] to him and then he takes the place
[40:39] that's yielded to
[40:41] him amen he's not a dictator but does he
[40:45] want control yes he wants control
[40:47] because what is his whole purpose to
[40:48] have preeminence he wants to have
[40:51] preeminence in a people that's his
[40:53] desire that's the second fold of his
[40:55] three-fold plan of the one purpose he
[40:57] had is to have de preeminence so does he
[41:00] want preeminence over you yes does the
[41:02] devil want preeminence over you yes but
[41:05] the devil will use every Wicked tactic
[41:07] Under the Sun to force you to manipulate
[41:09] you to trick you to scare you to to
[41:11] whatever he has to do Amen to hijack you
[41:14] to to Blackmail
[41:19] you but Christ is a
[41:21] gentleman all he does is share with you
[41:23] his promise he gives you a vision of
[41:25] what he wants for you he shares with you
[41:27] your purpose and your plan and who he
[41:30] thinks you are and what he thinks of you
[41:32] and all he does is he just take he just
[41:34] opens up his mind and he gives you a
[41:36] picture into his thinking and then and
[41:38] then that's
[41:41] it then he waits for us to say Lord come
[41:45] and take me that's what I want I want
[41:47] you to have me I want you to be my Lord
[41:49] I want you to control
[41:52] me so two different means of control
[41:57] amen but when we look at Jesus now he
[42:00] become the model he become the
[42:02] expression Colossians 2:9 says for in
[42:04] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[42:06] godhead bodily so everything that God
[42:09] was he poured into Jesus Christ and
[42:11] Jesus Christ was manifesting God the
[42:14] nature the character of
[42:16] God in Hebrews 1 2 and 3 he says ha he
[42:20] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[42:22] by his son whom he hath appointed heir
[42:24] of All Things by whom also he made the
[42:26] world who being the brightness of his
[42:29] glory and the express image of his
[42:31] person so Christ became the very Express
[42:35] or the exact fleshly replica of
[42:38] everything that God was was replicated
[42:40] in the
[42:41] flesh and then you could see the
[42:43] character of
[42:45] God and and as I speak of this I I I I
[42:49] want to go to a quote here in the
[42:50] message Shalom because my mind goes to
[42:53] this place as I've been meditating
[42:55] because to have this perfect Flawless
[42:58] character the character of Jesus Christ
[43:01] it doesn't always match what our idea of
[43:04] perfect character should be and in the
[43:07] day Jesus was alive it didn't match
[43:09] their idea of what perfect character
[43:11] should be they were very confused about
[43:14] things that he said and things that he
[43:16] did and actions that he took yeah right
[43:19] and so it just goes to show that maybe
[43:20] we don't have the right idea of what
[43:23] perfect character is amen maybe God
[43:26] knows yeah maybe we should yield
[43:28] ourselves to him and not try to dictate
[43:30] what what is perfect character right man
[43:34] sometimes what I what I find more than
[43:36] anything uh over and over and over again
[43:39] is I have formulated my own
[43:42] ideas and I filter everything through my
[43:45] own thinking right I'm saying more and
[43:48] more God please break that thinking just
[43:51] break it away and let me be yielded to
[43:53] you to do whatever you want to do the
[43:55] way you want to do it
[43:59] in the message Shalom this is what he
[44:01] describes of Jesus in his Earthly
[44:03] Ministry he says sir there's a young
[44:05] fellow around here by the name of Jesus
[44:07] of Nazareth have nothing to do with
[44:10] him what what does our bible teach us
[44:13] God Is Love who was the first with you
[44:15] when you were born your kind old priest
[44:17] that's right who came to you when you
[44:19] was in need didn't have no money and
[44:21] loaned you some money your kind old
[44:22] priest exactly who put his hand on your
[44:25] shoulder and on your mother's shoulder
[44:27] when you was about to separate and
[44:29] prayed you back to God your kind old
[44:30] priest who was it took sides with you
[44:33] when you and your neighbor was in fusses
[44:35] and brought you back together in
[44:36] Fellowship your kind old priest that's
[44:38] right who is it is who who is it is the
[44:41] last words going to say over you at your
[44:44] day uh at that day out yonder who is it
[44:47] they let you lay there and rock but your
[44:49] kind old priest comes and blesses you
[44:51] and sends the word of God along with you
[44:53] your kind old priest what about this guy
[44:56] called Jesus of of Nazareth then see
[44:58] what school did he come from your kind
[45:00] old priest had to sacrifice all of his
[45:02] life his grandfather was a priest his
[45:04] great great great great
[45:05] great-grandfather was a priest he put
[45:07] his whole time in the organization he is
[45:10] trained to the word he knows what he is
[45:12] talking about now we're talking about
[45:14] fruits of the spirit kind love joy peace
[45:17] understanding longsuffering patien see
[45:18] fruit of the spirit what about this
[45:21] Jesus where did he come from we haven't
[45:23] got a word that he ever come out of any
[45:25] school all he does is try to tear up the
[45:28] schools that we've built not much fruit
[45:30] of the spirit there is it what did he do
[45:32] up there when them poor Merchants down
[45:34] there and then businessmen that had to
[45:36] they they don't raise sheep so they set
[45:39] a little pen out there so the man can
[45:41] bring in a sheep that poor businessman
[45:43] he wants to offer a sheep because it's
[45:45] God's requirement he brings in the Sheep
[45:47] to sell to the businessman so that he
[45:49] can offer for a soul what has this Jesus
[45:53] of Nazareth done kicked over his tables
[45:55] took some leather and FL it together
[45:58] beat the priest out of there and called
[45:59] your kind old priest a snake in the
[46:01] grass a hypocrite boy they're making a
[46:04] strong
[46:06] case now you call that fruit of the
[46:08] spirit certainly not then where is your
[46:11] fruit of the spirit Landing up at no
[46:12] more than you think of compassion and
[46:15] him going through a multitude of people
[46:16] there multitudes lying blind crippled
[46:19] Afflicted withered halt lame and never
[46:21] healed any of them full of compassion
[46:23] people with a carnal mind will never
[46:26] know it
[46:27] amen that's the whole point friends
[46:30] people with a carnal mind will never
[46:32] know it
[46:34] am seminaries don't touch it it's a
[46:36] revelation certainly fruit of the spirit
[46:39] drops off there doesn't it them priests
[46:41] had 10 times the fruit of the
[46:45] spirit I'm just talking of outward
[46:48] manifestations in their idea that's what
[46:49] brother B said he had 10 times the fruit
[46:51] of the
[46:53] spirit how could you know what's right
[46:56] the man estation of the spoken word of
[46:58] God being made manifest light of the
[47:01] hour certainly there is what the
[47:03] evidence of the holy spirit is believing
[47:05] the word of God when it's manifested he
[47:08] was the word manifested and some of them
[47:10] denied it laughed at it made fun of him
[47:12] and called him a fortune teller some
[47:14] evil spirit there is evidence speaking
[47:17] in tongues there is evidence of the
[47:18] fruits the only evidence there is is
[47:20] when man believe the written word when
[47:23] it's Vindicated walking in the light of
[47:25] it
[47:26] amen so we find out that they they
[47:29] looked at the perfect Flawless character
[47:32] of Jesus
[47:33] Christ and they found fault with it yeah
[47:37] isn't that amazing right the perfect
[47:40] Flawless character they thought it was
[47:43] cruel for him to walk through the pool
[47:45] of Bethesda with the power to heal and
[47:46] heal nobody but one they didn't
[47:49] understand
[47:50] it they didn't understand it they
[47:53] thought it was cruel for him to call the
[47:55] kind old priest to snake in the grass
[47:58] sounded cruel to call the Pharisees
[48:00] Children of the
[48:03] devil it did sound cruel yeah it sound
[48:06] cruel if we preach like that I mean it
[48:09] sounds
[48:11] cruel but he had perfect
[48:14] character Flawless perfect character
[48:18] right it when he ran through the temple
[48:22] flipping over the tables of the money
[48:24] changers and beating them on the
[48:29] back those money changers who got a whip
[48:33] to the back had a hard time believing he
[48:36] had Flawless
[48:42] character sometimes we have to be
[48:44] careful how we judge one
[48:46] another we got to be careful for many
[48:50] reasons one is cu we're still
[48:53] growing we're all still growing
[48:56] we got to be careful what judgment we
[48:59] lay on our brothers and sisters because
[49:02] the real evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[49:03] not being the nicest person in the
[49:06] room amen the real evidence of the Holy
[49:09] Ghost is being able to believe the word
[49:10] for your
[49:11] day to surrender your life to it to let
[49:15] Christ come and work his will in us will
[49:19] it bring us the fruits of the spir yes
[49:21] the fruits of the spirit should be an
[49:22] outcropping but we're all growing in
[49:24] that
[49:25] still when we look at the divine
[49:28] nature first I want to read this quote
[49:30] from Satan's Eden I heard brother
[49:33] Neville say this morning someone might
[49:35] have been asking him why didn't I preach
[49:37] on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this
[49:39] here it is the Holy Ghost is the action
[49:42] in you it's a life not an emotion not
[49:44] some sort of a fleshly evidence but it
[49:46] is a person Jesus Christ the word of God
[49:49] established in your heart to Quicken
[49:51] every word of this age right watch the
[49:53] Holy Ghost In Action not so much in
[49:55] demonstration but in action what it does
[49:58] according to the
[50:00] word that's the Holy Ghost In Action
[50:02] what it does according to the word
[50:05] amen and so
[50:08] uh when I looked at these
[50:13] virtues I'll just read through them
[50:15] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[50:18] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[50:21] charity when brother Venom starts
[50:23] talking about this he says not just
[50:26] virtue he said but holy ghost
[50:28] virtue it's different kind of
[50:31] virtue because there there some of us
[50:33] can be born with certain of these
[50:36] characteristics or attributes that are
[50:38] just natural to us some of us are just
[50:41] naturally longsuffering just patient you
[50:44] ever met somebody who's just
[50:46] patient well they they got that
[50:48] genetically that doesn't mean it's Holy
[50:50] Ghost patience right we understand right
[50:53] so there's patience but there's Holy
[50:55] Ghost patience
[50:57] there's Temperance you have some people
[50:58] who are very self-disciplined they can
[51:00] work out they can eat right they can get
[51:02] up the same time every day they're super
[51:04] disciplined people they're that way by
[51:06] that's not Holy Ghost
[51:09] Temperance that's
[51:11] Temperance so none of these virtues that
[51:15] we're talking about are virtues that are
[51:17] part of our natural life These are
[51:20] virtues that come from the inside amen
[51:23] they're quickened by the Holy Ghost
[51:24] they're empowered by the Holy Ghost
[51:26] there's Holy Ghost Faith there's Holy
[51:28] Ghost virtue Holy Ghost knowledge Holy
[51:31] Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost patience
[51:33] Holy Ghost godliness Holy Ghost
[51:35] brotherly kindness and Holy Ghost
[51:38] charity and when we look at the Holy
[51:40] Ghost through these Divine Natures we we
[51:43] find out then if it's not if it's not
[51:47] just an inborn nature just something
[51:50] that you just have like brother Gabe
[51:52] preached one time on the grab bag of
[51:53] life and the grab bag of Life can give
[51:55] you a lot of bad things but it can give
[51:56] you some good things right you can be
[51:59] born just super self-control you can be
[52:01] born super disciplined you can be born I
[52:03] mean with an inward strength what they
[52:05] call a strong Constitution you can just
[52:06] bear down under a lot of things because
[52:08] you have a strong
[52:09] Constitution but that's not what this is
[52:12] amen this is completely
[52:15] different that just comes by that this
[52:17] is not anything that's inborn by Nature
[52:20] this is something that's part of the
[52:22] seed Gene of God it's part of the life
[52:25] of God quickened by the Holy Ghost ghost
[52:26] and empowered so then that means these
[52:29] virtues have everything to do with
[52:33] fulfilling the life and purpose of Jesus
[52:35] Christ which is the word amen so these
[52:38] virtues are attached to the word
[52:42] amen oh I could just you have some you
[52:46] you say you know brotherly kindness well
[52:48] we have some people who are absolutely
[52:51] just super bubbly and friendly all the
[52:53] time but this is this is deeper than
[52:56] that amen this is Holy Ghost brotherly
[52:59] kindness This Is The Life of Christ in
[53:01] brotherly kindness coming out of
[53:04] you amen and so that's what we need
[53:07] brother B said in the message the way
[53:09] back he said that's the way the holy
[53:10] spirit is it's not something you smear
[53:12] on or something like that it's a new
[53:14] birth you've got to be born again and
[53:16] these virtues of the Holy Ghost has has
[53:18] to come from the inside
[53:21] out so we you know the way it is those
[53:26] of us who are born naturally with one of
[53:29] these gifts or another we're born with
[53:31] natural
[53:33] self-discipline I mean you look at
[53:35] everybody else who's random and
[53:37] undisciplined as far from
[53:42] God that's our n that's the natural man
[53:44] we do that all the time somebody who's
[53:47] super nice and just bubbly and super
[53:49] friendly and you have somebody that's
[53:50] more of an introvert and they just don't
[53:52] go around talking to everybody in the
[53:53] for you they kind of keep to themselves
[53:55] it's not that they're not kind to their
[53:56] Brethren they just don't have the same
[53:57] temperament and you look to them and you
[54:02] say that's all
[54:05] natural right that's all natural stuff
[54:08] that's not what he's talking
[54:12] about what kind of faith is this Holy
[54:15] Ghost Faith what kind of Faith to
[54:18] believe the word for your day
[54:20] amen it takes the virtue from the Holy
[54:24] Ghost to believe the word for your day
[54:26] and keep believing as it
[54:29] unfolds virtue this is
[54:32] strength this is strength this kind of
[54:35] strength is not your natural-born human
[54:40] Constitution this is strength to Bear
[54:42] down and bear under and bear with for
[54:46] what reason for the word's sake amen cuz
[54:50] it's not the fleshly re it's not the
[54:53] outside man this is the inside man this
[54:55] is virtue that gives you the strength to
[54:57] stand in the face of criticism and stand
[54:59] with the word to take the pressure that
[55:01] comes Amen in persecution and be able to
[55:03] bear under or be able to bear under a
[55:05] trial and gives you special strength to
[55:08] bear under that trial that's Holy Ghost
[55:10] virtue and it has to do with the word
[55:14] right knowledge what kind of knowledge
[55:17] is
[55:18] this Holy Ghost knowledge the knowledge
[55:22] of Jesus Christ the the the word of God
[55:24] being revealed to you and a knowledge
[55:26] and an understanding having the mind of
[55:28] Christ amen that gets you through your
[55:29] trials so that you can manifest the word
[55:32] despite all the confusion that's around
[55:34] you there's a holy ghost knowledge it's
[55:36] not your natural ability to remember
[55:38] facts amen this is another kind of
[55:40] knowledge that comes by Revelation that
[55:42] gives you the knowledge amen like like
[55:45] like when we read in uh psalms 27 in the
[55:47] Rapture message he says thou has set my
[55:49] head above mine enemies that'll put me
[55:51] upon a Rock Amen what is that that's a
[55:53] place of Revelation where your
[55:55] understanding is higher than every body
[55:56] else around you and you can endure the
[55:58] trial and keep walking in the word
[56:00] because of Holy Ghost knowledge you know
[56:03] who you are you know what God's doing
[56:05] you know he's trying to accomplish and
[56:06] you just keep moving in the
[56:07] manifestation of the word
[56:10] amen
[56:13] amen Holy Ghost
[56:15] Temperance amen that's to bring
[56:20] self-control that's to bring this body
[56:23] subject to his word
[56:27] I don't think the divine nature comes to
[56:29] give you Temperance so you can get up
[56:31] early for
[56:34] work so you don't eat an extra
[56:38] dessert yeah that's carnal amen right I
[56:43] hope you're getting it we put so much
[56:46] stock on the wrong thing and that's what
[56:48] not what these Natures are here to
[56:49] produce they're not here to make you the
[56:52] most disciplined human being they're not
[56:54] here to make you the nicest person is
[56:57] these Natures are here so you can
[56:59] manifest the life of Jesus Christ so
[57:02] that you can manifest the word in every
[57:04] situation so that you can be him
[57:08] manifesting himself in this
[57:10] world yeah
[57:14] patience Holy Ghost
[57:18] patience I don't think Holy Ghost
[57:20] patience come so you can stand in line
[57:22] longer and wait for the
[57:24] discount so you can be patient on Black
[57:27] Friday
[57:29] and do you understand what I'm saying
[57:32] friends this is Holy Ghost patience to
[57:36] make you patient while waiting on God
[57:38] and waiting for God and waiting for God
[57:40] to move on the scene and waiting for his
[57:41] word to be made manifest and you wait
[57:43] patiently you can be impatient about
[57:45] other things you can come home from work
[57:47] and be impatient because the supper's
[57:48] not ready yet and that's okay but this
[57:51] Holy Ghost patience is makes you
[57:54] patience while you're waiting on God and
[57:56] waiting for God
[57:59] right
[58:01] godliness man this isn't a
[58:03] Creed this isn't a set of orders this
[58:07] isn't trying to do
[58:08] anything this is a a godlikeness that
[58:11] comes out of us amen you going to ask
[58:14] yourself what is God
[58:16] like when we read the Bible we find what
[58:18] God's
[58:20] like God is a god of Mercy God's a god
[58:23] of love he's a god of judgment yeah he's
[58:25] a is a god of Truth there are many facet
[58:29] facets to
[58:30] God sometimes we narrow it down we we
[58:33] make God be like the way we want God to
[58:36] be right so sometimes we want God to be
[58:40] just an all loving God and loving and
[58:42] merciful in the fact that everything I
[58:44] do is okay and we don't want God to be a
[58:47] judging
[58:49] God but sometimes we want God to be a
[58:52] judging God when it comes to everybody
[58:53] else we don't want him to be a merciful
[58:55] god yes yes so this is not godliness
[59:00] according to our thinking not godliness
[59:01] according to the church standard this is
[59:02] Holy Ghost
[59:04] godliness brotherly kindness it's the
[59:07] same way you and I both have seen people
[59:11] who can smooth and smooth and smooth
[59:14] make you feel so good and flatter you to
[59:16] no end and then later they say oh yeah
[59:18] come here and do this and come over to
[59:20] my house and leave go oh I hope they
[59:22] don't come over
[59:30] has anybody ever done
[59:33] that you don't have to raise your hand
[59:35] I'll raise
[59:36] mine that was a put
[59:39] on and we've everyone done it in order
[59:42] to be
[59:45] nice but it wasn't genuine from the
[59:50] heart this is a different kind of
[59:52] Brotherly
[59:53] kindness It's not the one that is just
[59:57] super bubbly it can be bubbly or not
[59:59] bubbly it can be outgoing or notgoing
[1:00:01] but this is something that comes from
[1:00:03] the nature of God that cause you to love
[1:00:06] your
[1:00:07] brother and love your brother maybe when
[1:00:09] he's being
[1:00:12] unlovable and then charity is love there
[1:00:15] nothing to do with human love nothing
[1:00:19] this is a much higher love this is the
[1:00:20] love that God has and this kind of love
[1:00:24] God is love Jesus Christ was the great
[1:00:27] attribute of God Called Love Is that
[1:00:29] what brother B said he was God's love on
[1:00:32] display and God's love on display would
[1:00:35] throw tables
[1:00:37] over in a temple and beat people out the
[1:00:40] door with a whip so our human love and
[1:00:44] our concepts of human love got to go out
[1:00:46] the
[1:00:46] door this is a different kind of love
[1:00:50] this is God's love this is the kind of
[1:00:52] love that can love Peter and turn and
[1:00:54] look at Peter and say get behind me
[1:00:55] Satan
[1:00:57] that can look at James and and John and
[1:00:59] say you don't know what Spirit you two
[1:01:00] are
[1:01:01] of that's love brother said love is
[1:01:05] corrective amen love is sacrificial it
[1:01:08] was the love God so loved the world he
[1:01:10] gave his only begotten son love is
[1:01:12] sacrificial love gives of itself amen
[1:01:14] and love does what's best yeah right but
[1:01:17] not always what feels good
[1:01:20] right and all of these attributes will
[1:01:23] say of the divine nature they all all
[1:01:27] give they they all come in response to
[1:01:29] something yes they all come when this
[1:01:34] kind of virtue is needed to respond to a
[1:01:37] circumstance or a situation where this
[1:01:39] virtue needs to to
[1:01:41] express so in brotherly kindness
[1:01:44] brotherly kindness is not expressed when
[1:01:46] all the brothers are being
[1:01:48] kind right brotherly kindness is best
[1:01:51] expressed when somebody needs your
[1:01:52] brotherly
[1:01:54] kindness amen
[1:01:57] patience expressed at a at something
[1:01:59] that's pressing upon you that needs to
[1:02:01] move and needs to change amen patience
[1:02:03] is a is it's an expression of God in
[1:02:06] response to a
[1:02:08] circumstance Temperance self-control
[1:02:11] amen something that's going to bring you
[1:02:12] into the control this outer manic
[1:02:14] control this flesh it's a response into
[1:02:17] a set of circumstances it's the very
[1:02:19] Life of Christ on the inside of you amen
[1:02:21] manifesting his own life and bringing
[1:02:23] about his own purpose in you it's his
[1:02:26] life that's why it's Holy Ghost Faith
[1:02:28] Holy Ghost virtue Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:02:31] Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] patience Holy Ghost godliness Holy Ghost
[1:02:36] brotherly kindness and Holy Ghost love
[1:02:39] why it's the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:02:42] coming through your flesh so that you
[1:02:44] can fulfill the purpose that he has for
[1:02:46] you it is not the outer
[1:02:50] man why because this message is not
[1:02:54] Reformation this message is
[1:02:55] transformation it's the inside man
[1:02:58] taking dominion over the outer man the
[1:03:00] outer man can still be a bit impatient
[1:03:02] that comes from the grab bag too and and
[1:03:04] this conversion is not to make the outer
[1:03:06] man who used to be impatient and it
[1:03:08] comes from a long line of impatient
[1:03:10] people and all of a sudden he's the most
[1:03:11] patient human being in the world he can
[1:03:13] still be impatient about certain
[1:03:15] things but when it comes to the word he
[1:03:18] can wait on God to fulfill his own word
[1:03:20] he can stand the test he can with
[1:03:22] patience wait for God to come on the
[1:03:24] scene and fulfill his promise
[1:03:29] amen the outer man's not getting
[1:03:32] converted he's being
[1:03:36] controlled
[1:03:38] amen that's why these virtues in order
[1:03:42] for these virtues to manifest there has
[1:03:44] to be something that's requiring The
[1:03:47] Virtue to
[1:03:48] manifest right so what what would be
[1:03:52] requiring
[1:03:53] Temperance well there's something that's
[1:03:56] that that that there's an opportunity
[1:03:58] there's a there's something that's
[1:03:59] that's tempting there's something that
[1:04:01] that you desire there's something that
[1:04:03] the flesh wants and God's going to have
[1:04:04] to give you
[1:04:05] Temperance to overcome it virtue where
[1:04:09] you going to need strength there's
[1:04:10] something going on that's we're going to
[1:04:11] require strength and that is not your
[1:04:15] strength that is God's
[1:04:17] strength so all of these virtues are
[1:04:19] coming to me in response to
[1:04:23] circumstances or situations that need
[1:04:25] this kind of
[1:04:26] virtue that's why sometimes when we get
[1:04:28] into situations
[1:04:31] listen we this is what brother I'm just
[1:04:34] going to read it it's my next quote
[1:04:35] thank God said after you done come from
[1:04:38] here to here to here to here to here to
[1:04:39] here he's talking about the statute of a
[1:04:41] perfect man climbing up that pyramid now
[1:04:43] you're coming into the full stature now
[1:04:44] a Son of God but you got to have this
[1:04:46] plus all this and you can't even start
[1:04:48] till you get this talking about faith
[1:04:50] now remember the black bird with peacock
[1:04:52] feathers don't forget him don't try to
[1:04:54] add it till you're actually born again
[1:04:57] cuz it won't work and you can't make it
[1:04:58] work it'll come to this or this here
[1:05:01] it'll crumble somewhere but when you get
[1:05:03] down here a genuine born of give Dove
[1:05:05] then you don't add nothing it adds to
[1:05:08] you amen love that quote amen you see
[1:05:11] comes on up all right coming into per
[1:05:13] Perfection now amen so now what God
[1:05:16] knows is God knows he's planted a seed
[1:05:18] of himself inside of you and inside God
[1:05:21] has all God's genetics so if these
[1:05:22] virtues are part of God's genetics it's
[1:05:24] in that seed
[1:05:27] and God knows that he's given you the
[1:05:28] Holy Ghost he can Empower you and unlock
[1:05:30] these seeds and give you the strength
[1:05:32] amen so now what God needs to do in
[1:05:34] order to get these virtues to manifest
[1:05:36] he's got to bring an opposition to The
[1:05:41] Virtue hallelujah what made us think we
[1:05:44] were going to Coast through life and
[1:05:45] have it easy we've got to manifest the
[1:05:47] life of Jesus Christ so he's going to
[1:05:49] bring an opposition to these virtues
[1:05:52] amen so that you can express Holy Ghost
[1:05:55] virtue Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost
[1:05:57] patience amen not your own patience and
[1:06:00] not your own
[1:06:02] Temperance but
[1:06:05] his oh thank you that's why sometimes
[1:06:08] when we dig down a little deeper we get
[1:06:10] to a place where we say God I don't have
[1:06:12] the strength to go through this
[1:06:15] trial amen how many of you listened to
[1:06:18] perfect strength and perfect weakness
[1:06:20] recently brother Stan price said he
[1:06:23] recommends that one and I know many have
[1:06:25] have read it
[1:06:26] and listen to it but it gets to a place
[1:06:29] where you say God I physically I
[1:06:32] mentally I emotionally do not have the
[1:06:34] strength to endure another day of this
[1:06:37] trial I need your virtue cuz mine's
[1:06:47] gone you get to a place sometimes where
[1:06:50] you say God I'm absolutely confused I
[1:06:52] have no idea what's going on I'm hearing
[1:06:55] different things from different people
[1:06:56] and I've got all this confusion in my
[1:06:58] mind and people all these voices are
[1:07:00] telling me different things I need Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost knowledge because I've come to the
[1:07:05] end of my
[1:07:06] wits I don't know what I should do I
[1:07:09] don't know what is the truth I don't
[1:07:10] know what the solution and my problem is

[1:07:22] of
[1:07:23] ours then maybe we can have his
[1:07:27] come to the end of our virtue then maybe
[1:07:29] we can have his virtue and I'd rather
[1:07:30] have his virtue than my virtue so I say
[1:07:33] God help me come to the end of my virtue
[1:07:35] fast help me to come to the end of my
[1:07:37] knowledge quickly help me to come to the
[1:07:38] end of my patience
[1:07:40] immediately so that I can have
[1:07:44] his
[1:07:46] amen I want to read Revelation 3 let's
[1:07:48] go back here together this has been
[1:07:50] stirring in me since uh brother Emanuel
[1:07:53] preached on Wednesday he stir up some
[1:07:56] things inside of
[1:07:58] me in in Revelation 3 we're going to
[1:08:02] read verse 14 the leoan church
[1:08:09] Age and and he read this and and we'll
[1:08:13] highlight some of these things in uh
[1:08:14] Revelation 3:14 and unto the angel of
[1:08:17] the Church of leans write these things
[1:08:19] sayith the amen the faithful and true
[1:08:21] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:08:23] God I Know Thy works that thou art
[1:08:26] neither cold nor hot I would thou were
[1:08:29] cold or hot so then because Thou Art
[1:08:30] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:08:33] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[1:08:35] sayest I am rich and increased with
[1:08:37] goods and have need of nothing and
[1:08:39] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[1:08:41] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[1:08:45] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:08:47] the fire that thou mayest be rich in
[1:08:50] white rment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:08:53] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:08:54] not appear
[1:08:56] and anoint thine eyes with isav that
[1:08:58] thou mayest see as many as I love and
[1:09:00] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[1:09:02] and repent let's go back to verse
[1:09:06] 17 because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:09:09] increased with good and have need of
[1:09:11] nothing and knowest not Thou Art
[1:09:14] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:09:17] blind and
[1:09:22] naked when they saw themselves they
[1:09:25] didn't see themselves in
[1:09:29] need but when God saw them he saw them
[1:09:32] with great need tremendous need because
[1:09:36] their condition was actually that of
[1:09:40] being uh wretched miserable poor blind
[1:09:44] and
[1:09:46] naked so they were in a terrible
[1:09:49] condition but they thought that they
[1:09:51] were fine and now we're looking
[1:09:54] spiritually because their spirit this is
[1:09:56] their spiritual condition yeah it's
[1:09:58] church at the end time but they thought
[1:10:00] that they were
[1:10:02] fine and
[1:10:04] so uh the D that's that's dangerous to
[1:10:10] me I kind of think it's dangerous to be
[1:10:13] born with a really nice good character
[1:10:16] yeah right right yeah amen I mean that's
[1:10:20] what we all want nobody wants the
[1:10:22] difficult child to
[1:10:23] manage everybody wants the easy peasy
[1:10:26] everything's
[1:10:29] fine but the danger comes when we don't
[1:10:33] realize we have a need
[1:10:38] yeah when we're born with a strong
[1:10:40] Constitution and we just can bear down
[1:10:42] it we don't realize we need a different
[1:10:44] kind of virtue yeah when we have
[1:10:47] knowledge and we're able to retain
[1:10:49] everything that we read and we can put
[1:10:50] it all together we don't realize we need
[1:10:52] a different kind of
[1:10:54] knowledge when we have Temperance
[1:10:56] self-control we're just born that way
[1:10:57] don't we don't realize that that is
[1:11:01] dangerous Temperance yeah amen dangerous
[1:11:05] virtue dangerous
[1:11:08] patience because it masks our need amen
[1:11:16] right so I I think God in his great
[1:11:20] wisdom make sure we have
[1:11:23] need and that's called trial
[1:11:26] yes and I thank God when he shows us
[1:11:29] that we have a need
[1:11:32] yes you
[1:11:35] know yeah when brother Emanuel started
[1:11:39] breaking that down in the Book of Luke
[1:11:40] and he started going over to lazarus's
[1:11:44] family and how he said everything was
[1:11:46] good they had Jesus coming to their
[1:11:48] table they they knew the ministry they
[1:11:50] had Lazarus and Mary Martha but then
[1:11:52] they lost Lazarus and they they wanted
[1:11:54] Jesus to come and heal him and and they
[1:11:55] they lost something amen and and he
[1:11:58] delayed his he delayed his coming so
[1:12:00] that Lazarus would now be dead and now
[1:12:02] they find themselves in a tremendous
[1:12:04] place of need and that's when he finally
[1:12:06] comes to them when all hope is gone and
[1:12:09] they they have nothing but need and all
[1:12:10] the security is gone and everything that
[1:12:12] they were resting upon is gone amen and
[1:12:15] now he shows up and in the hour of need
[1:12:18] what does God give Martha he gives her a
[1:12:21] revelation what does she get she gets
[1:12:23] something more than information she gets
[1:12:25] something more than false security she
[1:12:27] gets something more than a guarantee of
[1:12:29] a physical amen something physical
[1:12:31] that'll restore her back to security
[1:12:33] what she gets is something greater than
[1:12:35] anything she's ever had before she gets
[1:12:37] a revelation of who Jesus
[1:12:40] is what produced that it was her great
[1:12:43] need amen her great need produced the
[1:12:45] circumstances that would bring her to a
[1:12:47] higher Revelation than she ever had she
[1:12:49] knew he was a prophet she knew he was a
[1:12:51] tremendous man she knew she loved him
[1:12:53] and she knew that he took care of them
[1:12:54] and all the things that he did but now
[1:12:56] she comes to something that'll carry her
[1:12:58] through amen now that Lazarus is
[1:13:01] resurrected guess what we don't know the
[1:13:02] rest of the story Lazarus could have
[1:13:04] died again before Martha and Mary
[1:13:06] because Lazarus would die again but now
[1:13:09] she's got something more than Lazarus
[1:13:12] Amen to depend on she knows who she
[1:13:14] believes in yeah she knows the word for
[1:13:16] her day she knows what God has done and
[1:13:19] that Revelation can carry
[1:13:21] her that did something for me on
[1:13:23] Wednesday it just blessed me to to know
[1:13:25] end to realize that God would allow a
[1:13:28] need to come in their life because he
[1:13:29] wants to do something greater than
[1:13:31] resurrect Lazarus he wants to awaken the
[1:13:35] seed inside of Martha amen listen God
[1:13:38] may want to do something greater than
[1:13:40] heal your body he may want to resurrect
[1:13:42] something inside of you he want to may
[1:13:44] want to bring some of his own virtues
[1:13:46] out of
[1:13:49] you and then when he heals you then you
[1:13:53] get a double benefit because you know
[1:13:54] you get sick
[1:13:56] again but this thing that's come to life
[1:13:58] inside of you and the trial it'll
[1:14:00] sustain you through the next
[1:14:03] one praise God let's turn to First Peter
[1:14:13] together 1 Peter chapter
[1:14:23] 1 first Peter chap 1 verse
[1:14:27] 6 wherein you greatly Rejoice though now
[1:14:30] for a season if need be you in heaviness
[1:14:32] through manifold temptations that the
[1:14:34] trial of your faith being much more
[1:14:37] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:14:39] though it might be tried with fire might
[1:14:41] be found into the praise and honor and
[1:14:43] Glory at the appearing of Jesus
[1:14:49] Christ brother Braham says in the lean
[1:14:51] Church age he says but there is gold of
[1:14:54] God first Peter 17 refers to the same
[1:14:56] scripture that that the trial of your
[1:14:58] faith being much more precious than of
[1:15:00] gold that perisheth the gold of God is a
[1:15:03] Christlike character produced in the
[1:15:05] fiery furnace of Affliction amen that is
[1:15:08] the right kind of gold yeah say praise
[1:15:11] God
[1:15:12] Amen if you go to chapter 4 here 1 Peter
[1:15:15] chapter
[1:15:16] 4 verse
[1:15:19] 12
[1:15:20] beloved think it not strange concerning
[1:15:23] the fiery trial which is to try you
[1:15:25] as though some strange thing happened
[1:15:28] unto
[1:15:29] you it's not strange it's
[1:15:32] God is God what's what's God trying to
[1:15:35] do why does a trial
[1:15:39] come why brother B tells us because the
[1:15:43] gold that comes through the trial is
[1:15:44] Christlike character what is Christlike
[1:15:47] character is the divine nature amen so
[1:15:50] what's the trials going to produce in
[1:15:52] our life more of the divine nature
[1:15:56] why because these Divine Natures are
[1:15:58] here to counteract or or to help us with
[1:16:03] a circumstance or situation that only
[1:16:05] this divine nature will get us
[1:16:07] through thank god let's turn to the Book
[1:16:10] of Job
[1:16:19] together let's go to job 23
[1:16:34] job
[1:16:36] 23:
[1:16:38] 10 but he knoweth the way that I take
[1:16:41] and when he hath tried me I shall come
[1:16:44] forth as
[1:16:47] gold job knew that he was being tried
[1:16:50] but he also knew and believed that he
[1:16:52] would come forth as gold
[1:16:56] now gold when it comes from the earth it
[1:16:59] has impurities embedded in it and it
[1:17:03] needs to be
[1:17:04] purified and there's the purification
[1:17:07] process can be extreme heat high
[1:17:09] temperature it can be beating brother R
[1:17:12] told us the old days they would beat the
[1:17:13] smelter would beat the gold till it beat
[1:17:15] all of the dross out of it till it be
[1:17:19] purified I mean the reality is there's
[1:17:22] gold inside of each and every one of
[1:17:24] God's children
[1:17:25] right the gold is
[1:17:27] there but it needs to have the dross
[1:17:32] removed it needs to have the Earthly
[1:17:34] nature broke off of it it needs to be
[1:17:36] freed amen from whatever impurities are
[1:17:39] mixed in or holding it back or or
[1:17:42] contrary so that we get down to just the
[1:17:45] gold and what's going to do that in our
[1:17:47] lives firey
[1:17:52] trials
[1:17:53] man brother benam says in the message
[1:17:56] recognize your day in its message from
[1:17:58] 1964 he says job never recognized that
[1:18:01] it was God as long as the devil can make
[1:18:03] you believe something that that little
[1:18:05] trials you go through is is God
[1:18:07] punishing you it was God trying to show
[1:18:09] him something catch that it was God
[1:18:13] trying to show him
[1:18:15] something job never recognized it job
[1:18:19] never recognized it till he saw a vision
[1:18:21] like Moses when Moses saw the vision the
[1:18:23] pillar of fire in the bush it was
[1:18:24] Vindicated job in his question if a man
[1:18:28] dies can he live again I see a tree die
[1:18:31] and it lives again I see a flower die
[1:18:32] and it lives again that was his question
[1:18:36] but man layeth down he giveth up the
[1:18:37] ghost He wasteth away his sons come to
[1:18:39] mourn and he perceived it not oh that
[1:18:42] thou would hide me in the grave until
[1:18:43] the Wrath be passed he couldn't
[1:18:45] understand why a flower would die and
[1:18:47] live again how a leaf would go off of a
[1:18:49] tree down and lay on the ground and come
[1:18:51] back again in the spring he said man
[1:18:53] layeth down and and where does he go I
[1:18:56] believe God but what happens to a man
[1:18:59] but then one day the lightning began to
[1:19:01] flash the Thunders began to Roar the
[1:19:03] spirit Came Upon the prophet and he saw
[1:19:06] the coming of a man who could put his
[1:19:08] hand upon a sinful man and a holy God
[1:19:10] and Bridge the way then he screamed I
[1:19:12] know my redeemer liveth though the skin
[1:19:14] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[1:19:17] I'll see God he recognized what the
[1:19:20] resurrection was what what a what a
[1:19:23] tremendous re ration that job
[1:19:26] received what a tremendous Revelation
[1:19:29] that he he now saw the coming of a
[1:19:31] redeemer he now saw somebody that could
[1:19:34] pay the price and bridge the gap he now
[1:19:36] knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that at
[1:19:38] the end time his Redeemer will live and
[1:19:41] he will live upon the Earth in his flesh
[1:19:44] he'll see his Redeemer amen how did he
[1:19:47] get to this
[1:19:49] Revelation going to church heard A good
[1:19:53] sermon

[1:20:05] community he was a leader he was super
[1:20:08] wealthy we've talked about this before

[1:20:47] question that's troubling him down in
[1:20:48] his heart he's got a little doubt or a
[1:20:50] little question or something that he
[1:20:52] just can't reconcile in his heart and
[1:20:54] guess what God loves job so much that

[1:25:27] were going to go away I I mean I was
[1:25:29] foolish enough to think they were I mean
[1:25:32] I thought early on we'll get past this
[1:25:34] one and it'll be okay okay when we get
[1:25:36] past this one it'll be okay well you
[1:25:39] know what I come to the place where I'm
[1:25:41] I'm just comfortable with this one I'm
[1:25:42] not ready to move to the next one yet at
[1:25:45] least I know what I'm dealing with today
[1:25:47] because as soon as this one's gone you
[1:25:49] know the next one's on its path but
[1:25:51] what's God doing with all those trials
[1:25:53] he's bringing out his divine
[1:25:55] nature he's breaking us away from our
[1:25:58] own virtue and giving us his
[1:26:01] virtue that that's why I said it's
[1:26:04] dangerous to have a strong
[1:26:07] Constitution because if you have a
[1:26:09] strong Constitution and rely on that
[1:26:11] God's going to have to break you down
[1:26:13] pretty
[1:26:15] low pretty low if you've been gifted
[1:26:19] with a sharp mind God's going to have to
[1:26:20] break you down pretty
[1:26:22] low if you've got really good
[1:26:24] self-control God's going to have to
[1:26:26] really break that yeah because that's
[1:26:29] masking
[1:26:31] something he's got to get us to the
[1:26:33] place where we
[1:26:34] need not our Temperance but we need his
[1:26:39] Temperance we got to get to the place
[1:26:42] where we can no longer rely on our
[1:26:43] virtue but we need his
[1:26:46] virtue and the grace of God will bring
[1:26:49] us to those places friends he'll bring
[1:26:52] us to those places where we don't have
[1:26:54] the the strength we don't have the
[1:26:55] wisdom we don't have the answers we
[1:26:57] don't have anything so that we can come
[1:26:59] to the place where we're ready to say
[1:27:01] God I can't do it I don't know I don't
[1:27:05] understand I am
[1:27:08] confused I don't know which way to go
[1:27:10] and I don't know what the right answer
[1:27:12] is will you give me your
[1:27:15] knowledge I can't take another moment
[1:27:18] I'm about to
[1:27:19] crack will you give me your virtue
[1:27:24] I I can't control this urging inside of
[1:27:28] me if you don't help me I'm going to
[1:27:30] fall I need I don't need more of my
[1:27:34] willpower I need your Temperance in my
[1:27:39] life man too many times we try
[1:27:42] reformation and bucking up and trying
[1:27:44] harder and we'll we'll try new ways and
[1:27:47] new tactics of having more self-control
[1:27:50] right we'll have more strength you know
[1:27:53] we'll try to do things a little
[1:27:55] different
[1:27:57] so just fall on the Altar and be broken
[1:28:01] to pieces and say God I don't have
[1:28:03] enough
[1:28:04] self-control if you don't give me your
[1:28:06] self-control I'm not going to make
[1:28:10] it God I've come to the end of my
[1:28:12] patience I know you're I know your
[1:28:15] promises are true I know you'll answer
[1:28:17] my prayer I know but I just can't take
[1:28:20] the waiting any
[1:28:21] longer God I need your patience
[1:28:26] oh friends when we when we stop going in
[1:28:29] our own strength we stop running with
[1:28:31] our own legs and we start operating by
[1:28:33] the power of the Holy Ghost with the
[1:28:35] nature the divine nature of Jesus Christ
[1:28:37] It Changes
[1:28:38] Everything Changes
[1:28:41] Everything it gives us strength that we
[1:28:44] didn't know we had outside we're
[1:28:46] shambles but somehow we keep
[1:28:48] going people look at you say how is that
[1:28:51] person still going how do they get up in
[1:28:53] the morning how did I and they ask you
[1:28:55] how are you how are you doing it you've
[1:28:57] lost everything you've lost your family
[1:28:59] You've Lost Your Health you've lost how
[1:29:00] are you going you say I have no idea how
[1:29:03] I'm going it's not me going there's
[1:29:05] something inside of me keeps
[1:29:07] going you've been disappointed again how
[1:29:10] can you take another disappointment
[1:29:12] you've had so many disappointments and
[1:29:14] now you get knocked down once again how
[1:29:16] was it that you got back up and you went
[1:29:18] back to church how was it you went back
[1:29:20] to that place you say I have no idea I
[1:29:22] wanted to run away but the there was
[1:29:24] something in me that gave me the power
[1:29:26] to step back in to a hurtful situation
[1:29:29] again there was something that came up
[1:29:32] it wasn't me it was something inside of
[1:29:34] me pushing me amen like the little
[1:29:36] bubbling stream Amen brother brandham
[1:29:38] comes up to the stream in the winter he
[1:29:40] always likes to drink out of it it's
[1:29:41] always bubbling and always happy and he
[1:29:43] says why are you happy are you happy cuz
[1:29:45] the deer's come and drink from you no
[1:29:48] are you happy cuz I come and drink from
[1:29:51] no what makes you so happy he said it's
[1:29:53] something behind me bubbling up pushing
[1:29:55] me out oh that's the divine nature
[1:29:59] that's what we need we need to come to
[1:30:01] the end of every ability we've ever had
[1:30:04] and say God I've got to have your virtue
[1:30:08] your Temperance your patience your
[1:30:11] knowledge I need your godliness I have
[1:30:14] tried I have tried you know how many
[1:30:16] people say I tried to live the message I
[1:30:17] just can't live it that's that's because
[1:30:19] you need his
[1:30:21] godliness his godliness brings his
[1:30:24] Holiness his Holiness is his
[1:30:25] sanctification it's not you it's him
[1:30:28] inside of
[1:30:30] you that's why people feel restricted
[1:30:33] sometimes with the message they feel
[1:30:34] like it's restricting it's too tight hey
[1:30:36] you need some of his godliness and then
[1:30:38] you find out it's not restrictive it's
[1:30:40] life it's natural outflowing of the life
[1:30:43] of Jesus
[1:30:46] Christ we've tried too hard with our own
[1:30:48] intellect Our Own Strength our own
[1:30:51] understanding our our own patience
[1:30:55] so
[1:30:56] God keep creating need in
[1:31:01] me I don't want to be like the leoan
[1:31:05] church Rich increased with Goods have
[1:31:09] need of
[1:31:10] nothing all my ducks are in a row and my
[1:31:13] finances are lined up and I've got my
[1:31:15] job and my family is all this and we're
[1:31:22] fine it's better to realize we're not
[1:31:28] fine you ever wonder why every time you
[1:31:31] you get something
[1:31:32] secure God knocks the props out from
[1:31:35] under it you ever noticed that or is it
[1:31:37] just me every time you get a few nickel
[1:31:39] saved up and you think oh I got a month
[1:31:41] worth of savings and so
[1:31:43] now motor blows in the car transmission
[1:31:46] goes out it's
[1:31:48] gone why do you think God does
[1:31:51] that because I mean he could keep the
[1:31:54] transmission going but it's always just
[1:31:56] when you got enough
[1:31:59] right that all of a sudden it goes out
[1:32:02] and you say huh that's funny I've got
[1:32:04] enough money in the bank to pay
[1:32:07] it it didn't go out
[1:32:09] earlier and then everything it's gone
[1:32:12] again oh that's the grace of God in our
[1:32:15] lives amen don't ever want to get to
[1:32:18] where we don't have a need we don't want
[1:32:20] to ever get as a family we don't have a
[1:32:22] need as individuals as a church where we
[1:32:24] don't have a need we need to be
[1:32:31] needy let's turn to Psalms
[1:32:45] 51 Psalms 516
[1:32:54] Psalms
[1:32:56] 51-6 behold thou desirest truth in the
[1:32:59] inward parts and the hidden part Thou
[1:33:02] shalt make me to know
[1:33:07] wisdom God wants truth in the inward
[1:33:12] parts that means he doesn't want us
[1:33:15] living with a lie or a question or
[1:33:19] something in our
[1:33:20] hearts but he wants to put truth there
[1:33:24] in the innermost being
[1:33:28] Amen brother bam we we know really well
[1:33:31] standing in the Gap I've preached on it
[1:33:33] many times in the last two years but he
[1:33:35] made this statement at the end he said
[1:33:38] but the call of God must come where
[1:33:41] whoever wants to March towards the
[1:33:42] promised land let him March we're on our
[1:33:44] road to the promised land amen let them
[1:33:47] come March we're on our road to meet
[1:33:48] Christ at the end time and I wanted to
[1:33:50] bring this to you so that you could see
[1:33:52] and show you that the mistake that a man
[1:33:55] can make yet being sincere so brother
[1:33:58] Bron made a mistake and he was going to
[1:34:01] depart the mystery he was going to leave
[1:34:02] and he was going to trick his wife into
[1:34:04] going away and he was going to do all
[1:34:05] that but he was being sincere it wasn't
[1:34:08] insincerity that made him do that he was
[1:34:10] sincere but he was
[1:34:12] wrong but what made him do that a
[1:34:15] rejection
[1:34:17] complex a rejection
[1:34:20] complex so what did God do God made him
[1:34:23] face his rejection
[1:34:25] complex God didn't let him run away God
[1:34:28] didn't let him go up to Northern British
[1:34:30] Colombia God called him out on it and he
[1:34:33] had made up plans because he was hurt he
[1:34:36] was hurt because they didn't hear his
[1:34:37] ministry he was hurt because his friends
[1:34:38] rejected him he he had sacrificed his
[1:34:41] life he had done so much and now in the
[1:34:42] offense he comes up with a plan where
[1:34:45] he's he's going to to run away to
[1:34:47] Northern British Columbia and trick his
[1:34:48] wife and you know the whole
[1:34:50] story but it's amazing how God God won't
[1:34:54] let the prophet get get by with
[1:34:57] it he makes him face it he has to come
[1:35:01] face to face with
[1:35:02] it and here's what he
[1:35:05] says says Moses lost the feeling of his
[1:35:08] people because they wouldn't listen to
[1:35:10] him and brother Rory you see your dream
[1:35:12] and now I cannot go with a Ministry like
[1:35:14] that until I feel different in my heart
[1:35:16] about it no matter if God did tell me
[1:35:19] but that is the change that brother Roy
[1:35:21] that's see coming something's got to
[1:35:24] change me because I in my heart if I go
[1:35:27] out there feeling the way I do now I
[1:35:29] still feel that they ought to have heard
[1:35:32] the message they ought to have done him
[1:35:34] and I don't have the feeling for the
[1:35:36] people that I should have until I can
[1:35:38] get that feeling there is no need in me
[1:35:40] going because I'd be a
[1:35:42] hypocrite and all these years I've tried
[1:35:44] to serve him with a true heart and I
[1:35:46] won't go out there being a hypocrite I
[1:35:48] got to feel that that isn't Ricky and
[1:35:50] Retta and it isn't a this Bunch it's
[1:35:52] God's children children that's in
[1:35:54] bondage and I must go to
[1:35:57] them I love this because God told him
[1:35:59] you're wrong said if you do that you'll
[1:36:02] become a bum your wife won't stay up
[1:36:04] there with
[1:36:06] you and and God you know brought him to
[1:36:09] the mountain peak and showed him his
[1:36:10] life and showed him your commission your
[1:36:12] commission with greater gifts than these
[1:36:14] and you're to pray for the sick you're
[1:36:15] to do all these other things and he got
[1:36:18] he got his commission from God he knew
[1:36:20] what God told him to do but yet
[1:36:23] God wants truth on the inner
[1:36:26] parts is that true God wants truth from
[1:36:28] the inward
[1:36:30] Parts brother B said I know where I'm
[1:36:32] wrong and I know what I got to do to be
[1:36:35] right but I can't go till God fixes this
[1:36:43] inside what was he heard about he was
[1:36:45] heard at rejection because they didn't
[1:36:48] listen to him and we know that rejection
[1:36:50] pain comes from way back in his life all
[1:36:51] the way back from a childhood when he
[1:36:53] was
[1:36:54] rejected so here's more rejection pain
[1:36:57] on top of rejection pain and here he
[1:36:59] comes and and he has a natural human
[1:37:01] reaction to it and the human reaction is
[1:37:02] get away from the pain that's a human
[1:37:04] reaction to pain is get away from the
[1:37:06] pain but that's not God's
[1:37:09] solution God tells him I've called you
[1:37:11] to this you have no Escape
[1:37:14] Route and God makes him face it
[1:37:17] again I say God help us face whatever it
[1:37:21] is that's tripping us up help us to face
[1:37:24] it with reality and brother Brandon
[1:37:26] wasn't just smoothing it over and saying
[1:37:28] okay now I was wrong I know what I got
[1:37:30] to do and I go he still offended in his
[1:37:33] heart he still has this feeling in his
[1:37:35] heart and he said I know I I can't go
[1:37:37] out feeling this way even if God did
[1:37:40] tell me I can't go I've always served
[1:37:43] god with an honest
[1:37:47] heart oh praise God you know what that's
[1:37:50] to me such a such a blessing because now
[1:37:53] this Prophet had to stay in prayer and
[1:37:56] he had to trust in God until God
[1:37:58] supplied something he could not supply
[1:38:01] himself God had to bring some virtue God
[1:38:04] had to bring some healing God had to
[1:38:06] give him uh some brotherly love amen God
[1:38:08] had to give him some perfect
[1:38:10] love because perfect love is the one who
[1:38:13] who hung on the cross with all of his
[1:38:15] all of his Brethren rejecting him all of
[1:38:17] them mocking him and walking by and
[1:38:19] stripped him naked and hung him to the
[1:38:20] cross and making fun of him and he said
[1:38:23] father for forgive them they don't know
[1:38:24] what they do you know what that is
[1:38:25] that's charity that's love that's the
[1:38:27] capf stone you know what brother
[1:38:28] brandham need he needed Holy Ghost
[1:38:32] charity so that he could go back to his
[1:38:35] Brethren and he said I can't go until I
[1:38:39] get this feeling out well you have you
[1:38:41] ever tried to get a feeling out of your
[1:38:45] heart if you've been successful come and
[1:38:47] see me because I I have
[1:38:51] tried I pretended it's not there
[1:38:54] right I've just moved on and act like it
[1:38:56] everything was fine you you can't just
[1:38:58] get a feeling out of your heart you need
[1:39:00] God to come on the scene and God to
[1:39:02] bring some of his holy ghost virtue in
[1:39:04] Amen to bring his virtue his love his
[1:39:07] brotherly kindness he's got to bring his
[1:39:10] patience so that you can go back and say
[1:39:13] and his knowledge so you can say it's
[1:39:15] not my brother brother B said it's never
[1:39:18] your brother it's never your sister it's
[1:39:20] always the devil that gets between you
[1:39:22] know what we need we need some holy
[1:39:23] ghost knowledge to Lift Us high enough
[1:39:24] so that we can see that
[1:39:26] reality cuz we get down in our own
[1:39:29] knowledge and we say they did this for
[1:39:30] that reason and they did this for this
[1:39:32] reason and we got but we got to get
[1:39:34] lifted higher till we see what the
[1:39:35] prophet saw and say it's never your
[1:39:37] brother your sister it's always the
[1:39:39] devil that's getting in between and then
[1:39:41] when you can go and say it's not my
[1:39:43] brother it's not my sister it's the
[1:39:45] devil trying to separate us you can go
[1:39:47] right back in the action because you got
[1:39:48] a holy ghost
[1:39:51] knowledge amen when you get to the place
[1:39:54] where from the bottom of your heart you
[1:39:55] can say father forgive them they don't
[1:39:57] know they don't know how bad that hurt
[1:40:00] me like I can see that they really don't
[1:40:02] know and they didn't do it on purpose
[1:40:05] and when God gives you that kind of love
[1:40:07] you can go right back into action
[1:40:09] friends but until then we have to be
[1:40:13] real
[1:40:14] genuine we have to have truth in the
[1:40:17] inward
[1:40:18] Parts it's good to say I'm not healed
[1:40:22] yet
[1:40:24] there's no shame in saying I'm still
[1:40:26] dealing with this and I need God to come
[1:40:29] do what I can't do myself listen there's
[1:40:32] no shame in that friends we got to get
[1:40:34] to where the Prophet was and be honest
[1:40:36] and serve God from an honest
[1:40:38] heart say God I I'm still
[1:40:42] struggling I'm still hurt I need
[1:40:46] whatever you had on the cross I need you
[1:40:49] to put that in
[1:40:51] me whatever you love you had whatever
[1:40:54] patience you had whatever brotherly love
[1:40:57] you had when you were nailed that cross
[1:40:59] I need you to activate that in me
[1:41:01] because I don't have the power in my
[1:41:03] flesh to make this
[1:41:05] work listen friends if we had the power
[1:41:07] in our flesh to make it work we would
[1:41:09] have just changed our mind we could have
[1:41:10] jerked the feeling out of our heart and
[1:41:11] threw it on the ground and stomped on it
[1:41:13] and said but we
[1:41:15] can't we need something
[1:41:18] more say thank God for needs
[1:41:24] cuz needs will produce the Son of
[1:41:29] God what did the trial what did the
[1:41:32] trial Daniel went through produce It
[1:41:33] produced
[1:41:34] God in his
[1:41:37] trial when he went to the Lions then the
[1:41:39] pillar of fire come in why because he
[1:41:42] couldn't do it himself what about the
[1:41:45] three Hebrew children what did their
[1:41:46] trial produce It produced One like to
[1:41:48] the Son of God walking in their midst
[1:41:50] amen what will your trial produce if you
[1:41:52] let it produce do something it'll bring
[1:41:54] God on the scene it'll bring the Life of
[1:41:57] Christ on the scene it's the only thing
[1:41:59] that can overcome nothing else can
[1:42:02] self-help psychology none of it's going
[1:42:05] to work it's going to take
[1:42:09] Christ it's going to take him bringing
[1:42:12] his divine
[1:42:14] nature listen if you get a dose of
[1:42:17] perfect love it'll be
[1:42:20] okay what do you mean but no matter what
[1:42:23] anybody's done to you no matter what
[1:42:24] offense no matter what trial no matter
[1:42:26] what hurt if you get a dose of perfect
[1:42:28] love it'll be okay because perfect love
[1:42:32] was what was nailed to the cross saying
[1:42:34] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:42:35] they
[1:42:41] do it was perfect
[1:42:43] love that on the day of Pentecost when
[1:42:46] 5,000 were born
[1:42:49] again Jesus didn't say uhuh no no no no
[1:42:52] they
[1:42:54] they questioned
[1:42:57] me they weren't there to defend me when
[1:43:00] I was on the cross they even sided with
[1:43:02] the other side and thought that I was
[1:43:05] wrong no it didn't matter what they had
[1:43:07] done before amen the day of Pentecost
[1:43:10] when 5000 and it says and many priests
[1:43:14] and
[1:43:16] Levites the priests and Levites who
[1:43:18] wouldn't come to him the priest and
[1:43:19] Levites who wouldn't give him support
[1:43:20] the priests and Levites were part of
[1:43:22] that group that were condemning him they
[1:43:24] came to
[1:43:25] him he never said no no no you don't
[1:43:27] know what they did to me what was that
[1:43:30] perfect
[1:43:33] love don't ever think I'll never get
[1:43:36] over this I'll never forgive I'll never
[1:43:37] be free don't you dare think that you
[1:43:41] get a dose of perfect love in your heart
[1:43:42] and it'll be okay
[1:43:44] friends you get some brotherly kindness
[1:43:46] in your heart and it doesn't matter what
[1:43:48] your brother said doesn't matter what he
[1:43:50] did if you get Holy Ghost brotherly
[1:43:52] kindness in your heart it'll be
[1:43:55] okay if we're having a hard time getting
[1:43:57] over things you know what we need Holy
[1:44:00] Ghost virtue Faith Temperance
[1:44:05] love we need the divine
[1:44:10] nature you know what I don't think that
[1:44:12] our trials are going to end anytime
[1:44:15] soon because I don't think we've all
[1:44:18] come to the stature of a perfect man
[1:44:19] completely yet have you is anybody here
[1:44:22] have all the virtues is working
[1:44:23] perfectly in your life right now you've
[1:44:25] come oh well then that means you're
[1:44:27] going to have a
[1:44:28] need that means you're going to need
[1:44:30] more Temperance somewhere along the way
[1:44:31] you're going to need more virtue you're
[1:44:32] going to need more love you're going to
[1:44:34] need more brotherly kindness well if you
[1:44:36] recognize that you have a need then well
[1:44:40] fasten your seat
[1:44:43] belt here's here's job I want to I want
[1:44:46] to end with this if I could just wrap up
[1:44:48] with these last few lines let's look at
[1:44:51] Job
[1:44:52] 40 go back to the Book of
[1:44:55] Job God took job through this whole
[1:44:58] trial and like we said before it's so
[1:45:00] multifaceted we can never you can never
[1:45:02] say God did this with job for this
[1:45:05] reason that may be one of the reasons
[1:45:07] but you can't make it definitive God was
[1:45:09] doing so many things at the same time
[1:45:11] we'll never understand it he was he was
[1:45:14] showing he was showing what a Son of God
[1:45:16] was to Satan he was he was maybe doing
[1:45:18] something to correct his friends I don't
[1:45:20] know what all he was doing but we know
[1:45:22] one of the things he was doing was
[1:45:23] answering a question that was trapped in
[1:45:25] job's
[1:45:26] heart and so God brings job through this
[1:45:29] trial and he does everything that he's
[1:45:30] going to do and he gets to the end of
[1:45:32] the trial and and and job failed at the
[1:45:35] end of this trial because he began to
[1:45:37] say I haven't done anything wrong I
[1:45:39] don't know why God's allowing this to
[1:45:41] happen if I could just go talk to him I
[1:45:43] would settle I would settle because this
[1:45:44] isn't
[1:45:48] right and let's look at verse one job 41
[1:45:52] moreover the Lord answered job and said
[1:45:54] shall he that contendeth with the
[1:45:55] almighty instruct him he that reproveth
[1:45:58] God let him answer it job had been
[1:46:00] saying to his friends I've done nothing
[1:46:02] wrong I don't know why God's doing this
[1:46:04] this isn't righteous this isn't fair
[1:46:06] this isn't right that's what he's
[1:46:08] basically been
[1:46:09] saying and now God comes on the scene
[1:46:12] and it's funny how job
[1:46:15] answers then job answered the Lord and
[1:46:17] said behold I am
[1:46:19] vile first words out of his mouth behold
[1:46:21] I am vile oh God help me to realize
[1:46:25] without him how vile I
[1:46:27] am to think that I know better than God
[1:46:30] or I know what God's doing or I know
[1:46:32] what God should do or I know what God's
[1:46:33] doing in somebody else's life or I know
[1:46:35] what they should do I am
[1:46:37] vile only God knows
[1:46:40] that behold I am vile what shall I
[1:46:43] answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my
[1:46:47] mouth once have I spoken but I will not
[1:46:49] answer yay twice but I will proceede no
[1:46:53] further then answered the Lord unto job
[1:46:55] out of the Whirlwind and said gir up thy
[1:46:57] loins now like a man I will demand of
[1:46:59] thee and declare thou unto me Willl thou
[1:47:01] also diseno my judgment will thou
[1:47:03] condemn me that thou mayest be
[1:47:07] righteous my oh
[1:47:10] my I think it's good to say we don't
[1:47:12] know
[1:47:14] nothing it's better just to say I don't
[1:47:16] know
[1:47:19] anything I can't do anything right and I
[1:47:22] have no idea what God's
[1:47:25] doing but I trust him and I love him and
[1:47:28] everything he does is perfect I got
[1:47:30] faith in him but for me to explain to
[1:47:33] you what he's doing I don't know why
[1:47:34] he's doing I don't know I'm not God he's
[1:47:38] so much higher than we are job
[1:47:42] 42:7 and it was so that after the Lord
[1:47:44] had spoken these words unto job the Lord
[1:47:47] said unto elifaz the timite my wrath is
[1:47:50] kindled against thee and against thy two
[1:47:52] friends for he hath not spoken of me the
[1:47:55] thing that is right as my servant job
[1:47:57] hath therefore take unto you now seven
[1:47:59] Bullocks and seven Rams and go to my
[1:48:01] servant job and offer up for yourselves
[1:48:03] a burnt offering and my servant job
[1:48:05] shall pray for you for him will I accept
[1:48:08] lest I deal with you after your Folly
[1:48:10] and that you have not spoken of me the
[1:48:12] thing which is right like my servant
[1:48:16] job amen the reason that I put this in
[1:48:19] here is God took job through a terrible
[1:48:22] trial yes and job got broke down but in
[1:48:27] his breaking down he got the tremendous
[1:48:29] revelation of the resurrection and the
[1:48:33] Redemption then he began to get
[1:48:36] correction because he began to say
[1:48:38] things that weren't
[1:48:41] right and in his correction God put him
[1:48:44] in his
[1:48:46] place and job
[1:48:49] repented he repented because he was
[1:48:52] really rep and he realized how wrong he
[1:48:54] was but you know what no matter what
[1:48:57] happened in the trial and the beat down
[1:48:59] and the friends and his own error and
[1:49:02] his correction it never changed what God
[1:49:05] thought about
[1:49:08] joben now at the end of it all God says
[1:49:11] you three who said things you shouldn't
[1:49:13] have had you didn't speak properly like
[1:49:15] my servant job it's like what you just
[1:49:18] corrected him
[1:49:21] yeah and he says you go take seven
[1:49:24] Bullocks go to him and have him pray for
[1:49:26] you for him will I
[1:49:28] accept through it all guess what job was
[1:49:31] still a Son of God from the beginning to
[1:49:33] the end in the mistake and the beat down
[1:49:35] and everything with the question in his
[1:49:38] heart with the question that need
[1:49:40] answered with the troubles and the
[1:49:41] trials and his own false speaking his
[1:49:43] own wrong speaking and accusing God he
[1:49:45] was always the Son of God God never
[1:49:49] changed his mind about job and guess
[1:49:51] what no matter how many trials we come
[1:49:52] and no matter how many times we come to
[1:49:54] the end of ourselves and find out we've
[1:49:56] been relying on some false fleshly thing
[1:49:58] but we need the reality from God it
[1:50:00] doesn't matter if you do that 10 times
[1:50:01] 20 times 30 times 100 times you'll
[1:50:04] always be a Son of
[1:50:06] God Amen that's why God dealt with job
[1:50:09] because he was a son that's why God
[1:50:12] answered his question because he was a
[1:50:13] son that's why he took him through all
[1:50:14] of it because he wanted the gold that
[1:50:16] was in job to be
[1:50:19] refined God doesn't want your virtue
[1:50:26] he doesn't want your Temperance
[1:50:28] amen he doesn't want your
[1:50:31] patience he doesn't want your brotherly
[1:50:36] kindness he wants the gold that's inside
[1:50:38] of you to be refined and everything
[1:50:41] natural to be broke off so the reality
[1:50:44] from Christ can be made
[1:50:46] manifest his is better than ours
[1:50:53] remember Abraham even in Abraham's eror
[1:50:56] when he goes down to guar and lies about
[1:51:00] his wife and all of that and all the
[1:51:01] things that transpired and so many
[1:51:03] reasons for that possibly
[1:51:06] but Abraham never stopped being a Son of
[1:51:10] God it was aimc who was wronged who had
[1:51:14] to go to
[1:51:16] Abraham God never changed his mind about
[1:51:18] us friends amen just because we find
[1:51:21] ourselves maybe like the prophet one day
[1:51:22] with a reeling from a complex and hurt
[1:51:25] pulling back and wanting to run away and
[1:51:27] discouraged and hurt towards brothers
[1:51:29] and sisters or just because you find
[1:51:32] yourself in that place doesn't change
[1:51:35] anything about your position with God
[1:51:38] you're still a Son of God you always
[1:51:39] were a Son of God listen trials testing
[1:51:43] and trials are not about
[1:51:47] grades it's not about pass and fail it's
[1:51:51] not about how did you do on your last Dr
[1:51:53] I got an 80 I got an
[1:51:56] 85 has nothing to do with that
[1:51:59] friends listen you already made the
[1:52:01] Honor role your name's in the Lamb's
[1:52:04] Book of Life you're on the dean
[1:52:07] list doesn't matter how many times you
[1:52:09] fail your trial you're already on the
[1:52:11] Dean's List it's not about pass or fail
[1:52:15] it's about God molding us into his image
[1:52:17] and breaking everything else away from
[1:52:20] us you say well yeah I just had another
[1:52:23] trial I just messed up again well praise
[1:52:26] God you messed up again so Christ can
[1:52:28] manifest himself in a greater way in you
[1:52:31] praise God we found out we need him
[1:52:34] more praise God somewhere else in my
[1:52:36] life I come to the end of my
[1:52:38] ability I crashed again with no
[1:52:42] Temperance I crashed again with little
[1:52:43] patience I crashed again with no more
[1:52:46] virtue well praise God now you can have
[1:52:48] his virtue and his Temperance and his
[1:52:50] patience
[1:52:52] praise almighty
[1:52:55] God Amen what God wants friends is
[1:53:01] preeminence he wants
[1:53:05] preeminence how can he take preeminence
[1:53:07] when we're still holding on to things
[1:53:10] yes how can he have all of our heart if
[1:53:13] we still have things in our
[1:53:16] heart God's got to work it
[1:53:18] out and listen I know we can't work it
[1:53:21] out of ourselves we don't have the
[1:53:23] ability sometimes we don't even know
[1:53:25] what it
[1:53:27] is we just know something's troubling us
[1:53:30] we know we just keep getting trouble we
[1:53:31] keep falling into the same trap we keep
[1:53:33] getting hurt by the same set of
[1:53:34] circumstances we don't even know what it
[1:53:37] is we need God to do what he did for
[1:53:41] job we need God to do what he did for
[1:53:43] the prophet of God for brother
[1:53:45] Brandon we need to we need God to break
[1:53:48] everything down till we come face to
[1:53:49] face with the thing that's bothering us
[1:53:52] amen
[1:53:53] until we can be real about it and repent
[1:53:54] and say God I I need you to change
[1:53:57] something in me so that I can keep going
[1:53:59] I'm not just going to keep going I need
[1:54:01] you to change something in me so that I
[1:54:03] can keep
[1:54:05] going listen friends this message is
[1:54:09] real it's the power of
[1:54:13] transformation it's not fictitious just
[1:54:16] talking about fanciful things it is the
[1:54:18] power to bring his life inside of you
[1:54:20] amen his word into man estation his very
[1:54:23] divine nature living inside of you but
[1:54:26] we've he's a gentleman and we've got to
[1:54:28] let some things go we've got to face
[1:54:31] some things when he brings it back
[1:54:32] around till we face it again let's face
[1:54:34] it and be honest about it and say God
[1:54:36] I'm failing here I don't have the
[1:54:38] strength and I don't have this or that I
[1:54:40] need you to grant me your very own life
[1:54:42] because I'm I'm
[1:54:44] finished and then watch the power of God
[1:54:47] by the power of the Holy Ghost come and
[1:54:49] work in our life and begin to root those
[1:54:50] things out of our life friends
[1:54:53] oh I'm so thankful we serve a risen
[1:54:55] savior who's alive today and working
[1:54:57] today because his desires to have
[1:54:59] preeminence in you and
[1:55:00] I I want him to have
[1:55:04] preeminence brother B
[1:55:06] says and Christ is the mystery of God
[1:55:10] revealed he said when I think of it I
[1:55:12] just see denomination pass off the scene
[1:55:14] and everything else just going see when
[1:55:16] I see God's Great purpose revealing
[1:55:18] himself and having first to reveal
[1:55:20] himself in Christ the fullness of the
[1:55:22] godhead bodily and then to bring that
[1:55:23] fullness of the godhead bodily into a
[1:55:25] people that he could have the
[1:55:27] preeminence the oversight the
[1:55:30] leading thank
[1:55:34] God Amen brother mam says in in the
[1:55:37] message it is the rising of the sun said
[1:55:39] did you get that see our desire is not
[1:55:42] to be
[1:55:42] glorified our desire is not some big
[1:55:45] name our desire is not boost some church
[1:55:47] or make more in the Sunday school or try
[1:55:49] to bring in hog tie push and offer a
[1:55:51] picnic party or bring Stars buttons or
[1:55:53] something else like that that's not our
[1:55:56] desire our desire is to see him
[1:55:59] glorified glorified not with self- pride
[1:56:02] but in us our lives to prove he is alive
[1:56:06] and living in us if I can get myself out
[1:56:09] of the way so when William Brandon not
[1:56:12] even thought of and you not even thought
[1:56:14] of till we can see Jesus glorified among
[1:56:16] us see him that's our desire gives us
[1:56:20] the quickening power and it gives us joy
[1:56:22] to know that we are with him both flesh
[1:56:24] and bone of him being the Bride of him
[1:56:26] and seeing his same Vindicated methods
[1:56:28] proving in us that he is now risen from
[1:56:31] the
[1:56:31] dead oh praise be to God if I can just
[1:56:35] get all of me out of the way and then he
[1:56:38] can live his life his divine nature
[1:56:40] through me then then you say you know
[1:56:43] brother how did you make it through that
[1:56:44] trial listen brother I didn't make it
[1:56:46] through the child he made it through me
[1:56:50] they asked brother Brandon brother BR
[1:56:51] how did you hold on when you lost your
[1:56:53] mom your dad and you lost your brother
[1:56:54] you lost your wife you lost your baby he
[1:56:56] said I didn't hold on he held on to
[1:56:59] me this was the man who tried to commit
[1:57:02] suicide twice who cried himself to sleep
[1:57:04] at night amen he made it through but he
[1:57:08] didn't make it through because he wanted
[1:57:10] to kill himself who made it through
[1:57:13] Christ made it through through him who
[1:57:16] got Glory not William Brandon because he
[1:57:19] come to the end of
[1:57:21] himself we come to the end of ourselves
[1:57:23] and God steps in God gets the
[1:57:26] glory cuz we can be honest and say no
[1:57:29] listen I couldn't do it I couldn't take
[1:57:32] it another day I was I was quitting I
[1:57:36] was in the process of quitting I was
[1:57:38] telling God I was
[1:57:40] quitting instead of I'm quitting coming
[1:57:42] out of my mouth it came out of my mouth
[1:57:44] God have your way with
[1:57:46] me where did that come from that was him
[1:57:52] am praise be to God again in Christ is
[1:57:55] the mystery he said oh if God can get
[1:57:58] him prisoners like that now that's when
[1:58:01] he can express the preeminence you see
[1:58:03] he's got the man or the person so that
[1:58:05] he knows nothing but Christ you get what
[1:58:07] I mean all right that's secondly first
[1:58:10] to express himself completely God in
[1:58:12] Christ second to have the preeminence by
[1:58:15] this in his church which is his body the
[1:58:18] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:58:20] to express himself through them man
[1:58:24] let's all stand
[1:58:26] together if God is going to have the
[1:58:28] preeminence
[1:58:32] friends if he's going to have the
[1:58:35] preeminence then it's going to be his
[1:58:38] faith that has
[1:58:40] preeminence his virtue not yours and
[1:58:44] mine his
[1:58:47] temperence his
[1:58:49] longsuffering his
[1:58:51] patience if he's going to have the
[1:58:52] preeminence it's going to have to be his
[1:58:54] life not mine I'm going to have to
[1:58:56] realize how needy I am how broken I am
[1:59:00] how vile I am and how perfect he
[1:59:03] is you know what's so exciting is we
[1:59:06] don't live in the day of partial
[1:59:09] friends we live in the day of full
[1:59:12] realization God wants to use us to
[1:59:15] display his
[1:59:17] nature God wants to work in our lives
[1:59:19] God wants to do for us what only he can
[1:59:21] do for us so God in his Mercy he creates
[1:59:25] conditions that only his nature can
[1:59:28] Prevail
[1:59:29] against God brings us into circumstances
[1:59:32] that only his virtue will work only his
[1:59:34] Temperance only his patience only his
[1:59:37] brotherly kindness ours won't work and
[1:59:39] that is the grace of God to bring us
[1:59:41] into those circumstances where only his
[1:59:44] divine nature will work and that gives
[1:59:47] us the opportunity to crash ourselves at
[1:59:49] his feet and say God I throw in the
[1:59:51] towel
[1:59:52] I tried all I know to try and I'm I'm
[1:59:55] here again but God let your divine
[1:59:59] nature Minister Let Your Divine Nature
[2:00:02] overcome and so then the Overcomer is
[2:00:05] not
[2:00:06] you you're the
[2:00:08] surrenderer he's the
[2:00:11] Overcomer amen musicians if you'd make
[2:00:14] your way up brother Ben if you'll come
[2:00:15] let's just bow our heads and
[2:00:17] pray dear heavenly Lord Jesus we thank
[2:00:21] you Father
[2:00:23] God we're so grateful to you Lord that
[2:00:25] you know you know how weak we are we you
[2:00:28] know the Fallen nature we were born with
[2:00:33] so God you came and you purged us you
[2:00:35] cleansed Us by your own blood so that
[2:00:37] you could bring your life in your nature
[2:00:38] inside of us God you knew we couldn't
[2:00:41] make it on our own so you provided your
[2:00:43] life for us oh God I pray you'd come now
[2:00:47] fill us aresh with your spirit and begin
[2:00:49] to manifest your nature through us
[2:00:52] God I pray you'd help us to surrender to
[2:00:55] everything that we thought were strength
[2:00:56] in our lives may we just throw them down
[2:00:59] at your altar now may we break the idols
[2:01:02] of our own virtue and our own strength
[2:01:04] and our own Constitution and our own
[2:01:05] knowledge may we break those Idols at
[2:01:08] your feet Lord and may we humbly ask you
[2:01:11] for your virtue and your knowledge and
[2:01:14] your Temperance and your brotherly
[2:01:16] kindness and your love for that's the
[2:01:19] only one that will work Lord God we
[2:01:22] thank you for everything you've done in
[2:01:23] our lives we thank you
[2:01:25] God for a prophet who was
[2:01:28] honest told us the truth and told us
[2:01:30] what was going on in his
[2:01:32] heart so that we could be real and
[2:01:34] honest
[2:01:35] too so that we could recognize Lord that
[2:01:38] in our heart we're not right but we want
[2:01:41] to be right
[2:01:43] Lord in our heart we're struggling to be
[2:01:46] free and we can't be on our own
[2:01:49] Lord God I pray you would come come by
[2:01:52] your spirit and you'd pour the bomm of
[2:01:53] Gilead in and heal our broken
[2:01:56] hearts Would You Deliver Us Lord from
[2:01:59] the things that have troubled us so much
[2:02:01] from complexes and insecurities and
[2:02:04] troubles that have lasted a
[2:02:06] lifetime would you come and make us
[2:02:08] whole
[2:02:09] Lord God we've tried to use our strength
[2:02:12] and we failed we tried to use our love
[2:02:14] and we
[2:02:16] failed well we tried our patience and we
[2:02:19] failed we tried our Temperance and we
[2:02:20] failed
[2:02:22] in every way we
[2:02:24] failed but God your nature will never
[2:02:27] fail and Lord you've made it available
[2:02:30] to us it's by promise that this is the
[2:02:32] hour Lord and we raise our hands to
[2:02:35] receive from you that portion that
[2:02:36] you've allotted for us in this hour may
[2:02:38] you fill us with the fullness of your
[2:02:40] Holy Ghost and may you come and draw out
[2:02:43] the life that you put inside of us bring
[2:02:45] your faith your Temperance Lord your
[2:02:48] patience your brotherly kindness Your
[2:02:50] Love
[2:02:52] God if you would just bring Lord your
[2:02:54] own love it would heal everything Lord
[2:02:57] it would give us the power and the
[2:02:59] strength your power your strength to
[2:03:02] face our trials to face our
[2:03:05] questions to see them answered by a
[2:03:08] revelation
[2:03:09] Lord God those who are here Lord have
[2:03:13] struggled God may they recognize that
[2:03:15] the struggle is
[2:03:16] good may they be grateful for the
[2:03:19] struggle that they didn't just go on
[2:03:20] like the leot Church age rich and
[2:03:22] increased with goods and have need of
[2:03:24] nothing but God may they realize may you
[2:03:26] help all of us realize that we are needy
[2:03:28] Lord that we cannot do it that we're
[2:03:31] just going to fail again we're going to
[2:03:33] pick ourselves up and try to go on but
[2:03:34] we're just going to fail
[2:03:37] again Lord would you
[2:03:39] come heal our broken hearts and bring
[2:03:42] your
[2:03:43] nature so that we're not running in our
[2:03:46] own strength we're running in your
[2:03:48] strength so we're not flying by our own
[2:03:50] power we're flying by your power Lord so
[2:03:53] they're not overcoming in our own
[2:03:55] strength and our own will we're
[2:03:56] Overcoming By your
[2:03:59] virtue God we surrender to you have
[2:04:02] preeminence in us real
[2:04:03] preeminence we don't want you to have a
[2:04:05] shared space with any complex a shared
[2:04:08] space with any of our own strength Lord
[2:04:10] we want to empty out now and get
[2:04:11] ourselves out of the way so that you can
[2:04:13] come and do things in us we've never
[2:04:15] thought possible so that we can forgive
[2:04:18] that we can love that we can reach out
[2:04:19] in ways we never thought possible
[2:04:22] so that we can keep pressing on when we
[2:04:24] don't feel like it when we' come to the
[2:04:26] end may you give us a supernatural power
[2:04:28] to keep pressing on May you give us a
[2:04:31] supernatural patience to wait for your
[2:04:33] word to come to
[2:04:34] manifestation may it be you and not us
[2:04:38] Lord bless your people I pray that you
[2:04:39] would do the surgery that only you can
[2:04:42] do what you've done in the prophet what
[2:04:44] you did in job what you did in all of us
[2:04:46] Lord would you do it would you continue
[2:04:48] to do
[2:04:50] it tell everything is rooted out and you
[2:04:53] have
[2:04:54] preeminence in
[2:04:56] us God we want to see you
[2:04:58] glorified glorified because you're the
[2:05:01] only one that can overcome in this age

[2:08:03] I
[2:08:05] can't I know you want to be like Jesus
[2:08:08] but you can't either it's better just to
[2:08:11] come to terms with it you can't do it I
[2:08:13] can't do it it's going to have to be him
[2:08:16] doing it he's going to have to bring us
[2:08:19] if you've not come to the New Birth you
[2:08:21] need Christ to awaken that life inside
[2:08:23] of you you need the baptism of the Holy
[2:08:25] Ghost and those of you who had who still
[2:08:28] wrestling with a white dog and a black
[2:08:29] dog we need the white dog to
[2:08:32] win we need Christ to do things in us
[2:08:35] that we cannot do ourselves we need his
[2:08:37] power his life his love we need just a
[2:08:40] greater surrender is all we need we need
[2:08:42] a greater recognition of how needy we
[2:08:44] really
[2:08:45] are because we've been called bride
[2:08:47] Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after
[2:08:49] Wednesday and it's all true there's
[2:08:50] nothing wrong with it but we can get the
[2:08:52] term to think I'm secure and I'm fine
[2:08:54] but when it comes to the spiritually
[2:08:56] when it comes to your soul
[2:08:59] fine that's your destination it's sealed
[2:09:01] your name has been sealed in the L's
[2:09:03] book of life but when it comes to your
[2:09:07] heart when it comes to this life there's
[2:09:10] still work that needs to be done inside
[2:09:12] of me I want this flesh to be
[2:09:15] surrendered to be washed out to be
[2:09:17] emptied out to be healed so that he can
[2:09:19] manifest that life through me
[2:09:23] don't just think I'm okay when in your
[2:09:26] heart you know you're not okay you know
[2:09:28] you're not free you know you're bound up
[2:09:30] you know that you need virtue you need
[2:09:33] strength you need love you need
[2:09:34] something more because whatever you have
[2:09:38] is on
[2:09:38] empty whatever you have has failed
[2:09:41] multiple times don't just keep trucking
[2:09:44] through when you hear a servant like
[2:09:46] this say God that's there's a need
[2:09:48] inside of me that I cannot fix I need
[2:09:52] you amen I'm just going to invite you to
