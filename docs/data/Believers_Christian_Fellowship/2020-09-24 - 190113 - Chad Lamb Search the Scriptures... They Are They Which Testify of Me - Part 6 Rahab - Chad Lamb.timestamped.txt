[0:03] [Music]
[0:14] is
[0:18] should choose for me
[0:40] [Music]
[0:42] oh
[0:45] [Music]
[0:47] praise the lord god bless you it's good
[0:50] to see you all here
[0:51] amen when you have weather like we've
[0:53] had and a day yesterday like we had
[0:56] you appreciate each one who was able to
[0:58] make it in we're gonna let you be seated
[1:00] for just a minute and say god bless you
[1:02] it's very very good to have you here um
[1:05] i told you wednesday that we were gonna
[1:07] have brother john come and give us just
[1:09] a little
[1:10] quick report on his trip over to japan
[1:12] and let us know what's going there so
[1:13] we'd like for him to come at this time
[1:15] and take five minutes or so and then
[1:18] we'll stand and sing another song and
[1:20] go into the word god bless you brother
[1:24] john
[1:31] god bless you everybody
[1:35] it's good to be home and
[1:38] really nervous as usual so just pray for
[1:41] me my wife says my voice gets real high
[1:43] when i get nervous so
[1:45] i apologize in advance
[1:48] uh this is uh
[1:52] my second time to japan so uh it was
[1:55] just a real blessing i
[1:56] unfortunately wasn't able to go with
[1:57] brother craig this time but
[1:59] since it was such a short trip um
[2:02] you know we had brother danny and
[2:04] brother nestor heading over there
[2:05] they're just in a one-time zone apart
[2:08] and
[2:10] so i think brother craig's lord willing
[2:12] is planning on going again in may
[2:14] during golden week so um
[2:18] it was kind of nice the just the last
[2:21] minute
[2:22] when i was booking the flights you know
[2:24] it
[2:26] just had a little check about flying
[2:28] into narita
[2:29] and i realized you know brother danny
[2:31] and esther are flying into a different
[2:32] airport and
[2:34] so i kind of read it at the last minute
[2:37] and uh
[2:38] got a decent price and everything but i
[2:40] was able to meet everybody right there
[2:42] in
[2:42] hanita so this is just us when we first
[2:45] got there i took some pictures and we
[2:46] ended up arriving about within five
[2:48] minutes of each other
[2:50] so it was a real blessing we had um
[2:54] we had brother junior here on the on the
[2:57] far right
[2:58] and then brother emil next to him and of
[3:00] course brother nestor and brother danny
[3:02] and sister ruth on the far left
[3:04] there and they're always there to greet
[3:06] us and to
[3:07] you know take us around and be excellent
[3:10] hosts
[3:11] went back to hotel jose kind of came in
[3:14] the afternoon there and was able to rest
[3:16] up the next day we were able to meet
[3:18] with some of the believers there
[3:19] uh sister landland in the front here of
[3:22] course you just fireball
[3:23] for the lord and uh we were able to sing
[3:26] some songs and
[3:27] uh brother junior actually had a this
[3:29] isn't the same guitar he had a little
[3:31] backpacker it was just a little tiny
[3:32] guitar that we had right there at the
[3:34] at the hotel and just were able to sing
[3:37] some songs and
[3:38] had a little discussion heard some
[3:40] stories from brother nestor and all of
[3:41] his missions trips
[3:43] it was just a real blessing junior
[3:46] is a just uh
[3:50] he's kind of like a brother franco and
[3:52] uh you know just every all these
[3:54] brothers that do so many things he does
[3:56] everything there so
[3:58] he's the technical guy he's the music
[4:00] guy he's he's just uh
[4:02] just a real servant for the lord and i
[4:03] believe the lord's got something
[4:05] special for him so we're praying for
[4:07] brother junior
[4:09] just a sweet brother and
[4:13] of course the very next day we head down
[4:15] to the camp in yokohama so
[4:18] uh everywhere you go it's either a taxi
[4:20] or a train or a bus
[4:21] and uh just totally different than what
[4:23] you're used to you know
[4:25] once we got down to the camp this is the
[4:28] group that had gathered there
[4:30] most of them you probably know from
[4:32] before but there was
[4:34] you know brother ruse and sister emil
[4:35] are always reaching out
[4:37] always witnessing
[4:40] and so there's a few folks that they had
[4:42] just talked to that
[4:43] that invited to the camp and were able
[4:45] to come and enjoy the messages and
[4:47] and some of the fun things we were able
[4:50] to do here we actually made mochi
[4:52] so i know whether nathan probably would
[4:55] appreciate
[4:56] this but we're pounding mochi
[5:00] here and it's
[5:03] quite the exercise it's just a
[5:07] short grain rice that uh you
[5:10] you work it you steam it and you you uh
[5:12] mash it and then you pound it
[5:14] and it becomes a real kind of a
[5:16] interesting
[5:17] gooey gummy kind of a it it sounds
[5:21] i'm making it sound bad but it actually
[5:23] was very good of course it
[5:24] it kind of had a smell like uh cream of
[5:26] wheat but
[5:28] the basically this this bowl here has
[5:31] some some of the toppings so you'd roll
[5:33] this
[5:33] into different types of toppings so
[5:35] there was a
[5:38] soy flour and a i think a sesame seed
[5:41] and a sweet bean and so it just kind of
[5:44] goes with a little bit of everything
[5:45] so it's quite a treat there
[5:49] this is brother fedomar and his wife
[5:51] grace and their little daughter gianna
[5:53] she's just cute as a button i know my my
[5:55] little daughter fell in love with her
[5:57] too so
[5:58] but uh brother fed is actually from the
[6:01] philippines
[6:02] and uh the lord's placed him there for
[6:05] work
[6:06] and while he's there he's been helping
[6:08] the believers there
[6:09] with bible studies every week and he and
[6:11] brother emile are kind of taking back
[6:13] and forth and
[6:14] preaching a little bit and so they're
[6:17] they've done their first communion just
[6:18] recently and
[6:20] it's been really good so brother fed's
[6:22] just been a huge blessing
[6:25] we had another treat we had this i
[6:27] believe it's called
[6:29] adabo it's a filipino dish
[6:32] it's actually this chicken on top of the
[6:34] rice it's a special barbecued style
[6:37] so we had a little of that and we had
[6:39] some japanese curry in the back and some
[6:41] vegetables that all the food there was
[6:42] really good i just really enjoyed myself
[6:44] only had one little incident and
[6:47] it wasn't anything major just they kind
[6:50] of told me after you know we had a
[6:51] little
[6:52] last day we were there we went to a
[6:55] authentic japanese restaurant and
[6:58] on the side and they had a little sushi
[7:01] underneath some stuff
[7:02] you know and so i'm like well you know
[7:04] i'll try it it's
[7:05] i'm not big on sushi but uh but it was
[7:08] actually
[7:08] very very good and you know after you
[7:11] get past the thought of
[7:12] i'm eating raw fish it was very good but
[7:15] the food was just excellent
[7:17] and uh the next morning i i found out
[7:20] that well you're really supposed to
[7:21] drink a little green tea
[7:23] or maybe a little uh wine or something
[7:26] to kill that stuff that you've just
[7:27] eaten i'm like well
[7:29] that would have been nice to know the
[7:31] night before
[7:33] so anyway of course brother uh
[7:37] brother nestor there uh he he
[7:40] he opened up the uh the tabernacle of
[7:43] god and typed it to the to the christian
[7:45] and uh it was just a real blessing to
[7:47] the camp there
[7:48] and then brother danny spoke uh the next
[7:50] day
[7:51] um i'm sorry we had two services there
[7:54] at the camp
[7:55] the very next day this is the very next
[7:57] day we took a picture of everyone there
[7:58] that was that was left anyway
[8:00] and uh before they'd all lead headed out
[8:03] we ended up uh
[8:05] taking a train again and several of the
[8:06] believers came back with us to funebori
[8:08] this is
[8:09] this is nearer to tokyo and
[8:12] this is sister zhang jing on the left
[8:14] here she's always
[8:16] supporting the meetings always in
[8:17] attendance she's a chinese sister that's
[8:19] been in japan for many years and been in
[8:21] the message for a few years and
[8:23] and uh just a real godly sister
[8:27] and we're just glad to have her in our
[8:29] meetings
[8:30] and sister ruth of course sister ruth is
[8:33] is
[8:34] the primary japanese translator at this
[8:36] point we've
[8:37] she's always been there especially in
[8:39] the tokyo area she's they're living in
[8:40] yokohama
[8:41] and they've always been faithful to come
[8:44] and translate
[8:46] on the trains this is uh brother danny
[8:48] and brother nestor of course and on the
[8:50] right here is brother
[8:52] brother mark raito and he's also a
[8:55] philippine brother
[8:56] and i think the chad had mentioned that
[8:58] they had a a
[8:59] uh song leader there from the
[9:01] philippines and so he's gifted
[9:03] in leading worship and and so he's been
[9:05] a real blessing to the believers there
[9:07] he's there for school
[9:08] and work i think he's working on his
[9:11] doctorate
[9:11] so um this these are the meetings in
[9:14] funaburi
[9:15] uh we kind of
[9:18] you know brother brother danny made the
[9:21] the type about
[9:23] you know we we've kind of messed up the
[9:25] room you know we came in it was
[9:26] everything was perfect
[9:27] it wasn't set up really good for
[9:28] services so
[9:30] so we kind of moved all the tables
[9:31] around and shifted all the chairs around
[9:33] and
[9:34] finally you know brother brother danny
[9:35] at the end of the services
[9:38] uh you know i said there he preached on
[9:39] the restoration
[9:41] uh the message of restoration and he
[9:43] says you know this room we've got it all
[9:44] messed up
[9:45] but before we can leave here we've got
[9:47] to get it all restored
[9:49] and so it's just a beautiful thing and i
[9:51] really i really appreciated brother
[9:52] nestor's teaching
[9:53] it's just back to the fundamentals and
[9:55] the basics and it just
[9:57] blesses you all over again he went
[9:58] through the church ages
[10:00] and spent you know one service about two
[10:03] and a half hours
[10:04] uh the first three church ages and uh so
[10:07] we had a full day this was on sunday
[10:10] and we had this the services from nine
[10:12] in the morning till nine in the evening
[10:14] it's a full solid day of services
[10:18] um sister landland again
[10:22] with her daughter yusi she's about
[10:26] i think she's about 13 years old
[10:29] and on the far uh
[10:32] left of course is sister sister jung
[10:34] jing again
[10:36] and then in the middle uh next to sister
[10:38] jung jing his sister
[10:39] naomi this is rusin emil's daughter
[10:41] she's been translating perfect english
[10:43] perfect japanese
[10:45] and so she's just she helps out a lot
[10:48] during the preaching so she'll she'll
[10:50] she'll uh and i believe she's also
[10:52] beginning to translate messages
[10:54] so uh next to her
[10:57] is sister rebecca and she is
[11:01] also a japanese translator but she's
[11:02] also chinese so she she was
[11:04] translating into chinese for the chinese
[11:06] believers that were there
[11:08] and this is her little sister winner and
[11:10] she's
[11:11] about 14 i believe so
[11:15] again we're going back into the seven
[11:17] church ages
[11:18] and extremely long day brother brother
[11:21] nestor i believe
[11:22] was extremely tired and i know we had
[11:24] our meals right there
[11:26] in the room we hardly left it all all
[11:28] day
[11:29] but at the end of the day you know
[11:31] brother nestor had preached his heart
[11:34] out
[11:34] he was just spent
[11:37] but you know at the very end of the
[11:38] service brother danny was talking about
[11:40] the message of restoration and
[11:41] was wanted to go into some
[11:44] question and answers we thought well
[11:46] we'll break and we'll come back well
[11:48] instantly you know questions start
[11:51] coming up right then and so we just kind
[11:53] of
[11:53] kept going rather danny was rolling with
[11:55] it brother nestor said no he's doing a
[11:57] great job i'm going to sit here
[11:59] this brother is brother george now
[12:01] brother george is a nigerian
[12:03] he's a pastor and he's starting a church
[12:05] there in japan
[12:07] another brother that bruce and emil have
[12:09] witnessed to
[12:10] and uh he wanted to come and join the
[12:12] program that we
[12:13] that we had at the camp and he liked
[12:15] what he heard so much
[12:17] he said well you know i have to pastor
[12:19] the church on sunday
[12:20] but maybe i can come some day sunday
[12:21] afternoon and so he came for the for the
[12:24] services sunday afternoon and just
[12:26] he said he was extremely blessed and he
[12:28] had a lot of questions and so he started
[12:30] asking questions
[12:31] you know what about the the foolish
[12:33] virgin what about the
[12:35] you know the trinity and what about the
[12:36] baptism and and so it was just
[12:38] really good and we had i had a little
[12:40] interview with him afterwards and he
[12:42] just
[12:43] thoroughly enjoyed himself he said he's
[12:44] really gonna
[12:46] dig into the we gave him a little usb
[12:48] stick that had everything on it has all
[12:50] the messages
[12:51] from 62 on it has all the text it has
[12:54] all the sermons that everybody has
[12:55] preached in tokyo up to this point
[12:57] brother franco has done an amazing job
[13:00] of cramming all this stuff on a little
[13:02] thumb drive and and so i appreciate
[13:05] brother franco
[13:07] and uh so pray for brother george he's
[13:09] he's seeing things for the first time
[13:11] and he's just
[13:11] uh really excited about it
[13:16] so of course the end of the the day
[13:18] we're extremely tired so naturally
[13:20] we went to denny's so denny's is our
[13:24] our favorite hangout and so
[13:27] uh the next day of course we had a
[13:29] little down time i was extremely tired
[13:32] and i slept
[13:32] in that morning and kind of missed our
[13:35] breakfast and uh
[13:37] brother nestor and brother danny went
[13:38] out and and uh were able to see
[13:41] tokyo a little bit and the next day of
[13:44] course we're heading out to the airport
[13:46] to leave and of course brother emile and
[13:50] sister ruth met us there
[13:52] always there to to greet us and uh
[13:56] so this was right before we leave on the
[13:58] airplane they came and visited with this
[14:00] fellowship just
[14:01] had some testimonies and told us a
[14:02] little bit about the their
[14:04] previous church and those kind of things
[14:07] is just a real blessing
[14:09] you know we we got there it was about
[14:14] in the 50s i mean it was really nice and
[14:16] of course brother nestor and brother
[14:17] danny
[14:18] are from the tropical zone and they're
[14:21] all shivering bundle up with
[14:22] you know scarves and hats and we ended
[14:24] up having to make a
[14:26] stop to get long johns at the local mall
[14:29] you know and uh
[14:30] and so you know it was it was a
[14:34] it was kind of an interesting thing but
[14:36] but you know i told him it was probably
[14:37] a lot colder here
[14:39] and so i was kind of excited about it i
[14:42] was
[14:42] kind of open jacket and having a good
[14:44] time
[14:45] but you know we realized
[14:48] i'd like to read a little scripture
[14:52] in first timothy 6 and verse 19
[14:56] it says laying up in store for
[14:58] themselves a good foundation against the
[15:01] time to come
[15:02] that they may lay hold on eternal life
[15:05] and it's
[15:06] talking about uh the rich how they
[15:09] lay up i believe we're spiritually rich
[15:11] people
[15:12] and i believe that was the emphasis of
[15:14] this trip was laying up food
[15:16] for the japanese believers and so you
[15:19] know
[15:20] sometimes i feel like it's an
[15:22] insignificant part
[15:24] to uh to just go and
[15:27] take some footage but really that
[15:29] footage comes back brother franco
[15:31] works tirelessly for months to put all
[15:34] that together
[15:35] to be able to send it back over and for
[15:37] the believers to be able to feed on that
[15:39] and you know it's uh it's just a
[15:41] tremendous blessing
[15:43] and it's exciting to see how you know
[15:45] we've we've
[15:46] started to give them the message in
[15:48] their in their hands and they've
[15:49] started to eat it up and started to
[15:53] translate i believe just since we were
[15:55] there last there was another
[15:56] six or seven messages that they
[15:58] translated so we're just praying for
[16:00] more translators praying for
[16:02] the lord to just open the doors and it's
[16:05] a just a monumental task when you think
[16:06] about how many there are but
[16:08] really you know there's god knows
[16:10] exactly what he's doing
[16:11] um you know i've kind of been ignoring
[16:15] my notes
[16:16] but uh something something i appreciated
[16:20] was
[16:21] you know the they're they're uh they
[16:23] obviously are
[16:24] are very hungry and they're they're also
[16:26] streaming services sometimes to stream
[16:28] our services or other brother services
[16:30] and i realized
[16:31] when i was there that you know when when
[16:34] we
[16:34] pull on the gift that god's given us
[16:39] it doesn't just bless us but it blesses
[16:42] those
[16:43] that are online that are going to see
[16:44] this later and it's a huge blessing so
[16:47] remember that you know we're not just
[16:48] pulling for us we're pulling for
[16:51] everyone that might get that see i
[16:53] believe god's given us
[16:54] this gift for a purpose and i believe
[16:57] it's not just for us
[16:58] so um some amazing things
[17:04] right now in japan in in april
[17:08] there the current emperor is actually
[17:11] going to abdicate he's going to
[17:13] step down before he dies this is the
[17:14] first time this has happened
[17:16] in almost forever this this
[17:19] family i believe has ruled since 660 bc
[17:22] and so this emperor is stepping down
[17:26] making huge waves uh everybody's unsure
[17:28] they're uncertain about the political
[17:30] landscape they're they're expecting good
[17:32] things but summer summer
[17:34] you know just a lot of turmoil about it
[17:36] and uh
[17:38] shortly after this in april the end of
[17:40] april this is when the golden week i
[17:42] know brother brother
[17:43] uh with craig will be going about that
[17:46] time
[17:47] this is when the transition is going to
[17:49] happen and uh shortly after that is when
[17:50] the pope was going to be visiting japan
[17:53] so we also knew they've told us that
[17:57] every time
[17:57] the missionary brothers have come
[18:00] there's always been earthquakes
[18:02] it's kind of in the earthquake zone but
[18:03] there's always been earthquakes while
[18:05] they're there and there was some there
[18:06] were some minor earthquakes while we
[18:07] were there this time
[18:09] but not only that we also had a comet
[18:12] not a comet but a an asteroid
[18:14] that came through brother brother dean
[18:16] pointed this out to us
[18:17] that in the south of japan streaked
[18:20] across the sky is extremely bright you
[18:22] can look it up online i was going to try
[18:23] to
[18:24] put a little video on here but if you
[18:27] look it up online the
[18:28] japanese fireball and it was a huge
[18:30] fireball
[18:31] come across the sky you know we don't
[18:34] really know
[18:36] i don't want to say i know what these
[18:37] things mean but i know that the lord's
[18:39] doing something in japan
[18:40] and so i'm just excited for the people

[20:04] whole time he's not just sitting back

[20:08] catching pictures of people eating their
[20:10] meals

[20:19] the
[20:19] all the hours he puts in just to make
[20:22] sure that all that was gained is not

[23:06] so there's a lot that couldn't make it
[23:08] and we just trust that they're streaming
[23:10] in
[23:10] which means everybody here has to pull
[23:12] double duty pooling
[23:14] amen because amen the ones that are
[23:17] streaming are depending the ones that
[23:18] couldn't come in and are tuning in are
[23:20] depending on us amen and i'm just
[23:22] appreciate each one of you
[23:24] and we're thankful for you being here
[23:27] also i want to say thank you to brother
[23:28] jim rast but the gym rest started
[23:30] plowing snow last night at midnight

[23:35] think he's at home in bed right now
[23:37] but we can say god bless by the gym we
[23:39] appreciate him very much
[23:41] also appreciate blake and and david they
[23:43] came over and cleared the sidewalks this
[23:45] morning and
[23:46] it's just wonderful we can walk in the
[23:48] church and we can be here and
[23:50] we appreciate everybody who does their
[23:51] part amen
[23:53] let's read this scripture together we're
[23:54] going to read 2 and then we'll let you
[23:55] be seated
[23:59] chapter 5 verse 39
[24:03] search the scriptures for in them you
[24:05] think you have eternal life
[24:07] and they are they which testify of me
[24:10] now if we could go back to luke if you
[24:12] turn with me back to luke 24
[24:15] i'd like to read one scripture out of
[24:17] luke 24 we know this is the
[24:19] as the road to emmaus
[24:25] just one verse verse 27 and beginning at
[24:28] moses
[24:29] and all the prophets he expounded to
[24:31] them all the scriptures the things
[24:33] concerning
[24:34] himself amen so starting back at the
[24:37] beginning at genesis
[24:40] moses the first five books of the bible
[24:42] and all the prophets that's all the word
[24:44] he expound unto them and in all the
[24:47] scriptures
[24:49] all right we have to understand he
[24:51] didn't just tell them all the scriptures
[24:52] that concern him no
[24:54] it says he expounded unto them in
[24:57] all the scriptures
[25:00] he took the entire bible to date
[25:04] for his text
[25:07] amen i like jesus on the road to the
[25:10] mass
[25:10] i'd like to take for my text the entire
[25:14] bible that's what jesus did on the road
[25:16] to emmaus amen it says beginning at
[25:18] moses and all the prophets
[25:19] expounded unto them in all the
[25:21] scriptures
[25:23] the things concerning himself
[25:27] that means he went back in every type
[25:29] and in every shadow
[25:31] and in every character he started
[25:33] pulling out amen the things that was
[25:35] concerning him
[25:36] that was in all the scriptures
[25:39] how many would have liked to been on
[25:41] that trip
[25:42] we've been on a similar one friends
[25:45] we've walked this road with a prophet in
[25:47] this day
[25:48] and let's just bow our heads and pray
[25:51] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[25:53] jesus for this time that we have with
[25:55] you oh god we pray
[25:57] now that you would come down lord and
[25:59] and take complete control of this vessel
[26:02] standing behind this desk
[26:04] lord we don't want to hear the thoughts
[26:05] of a man we don't want to hear the words
[26:07] that come
[26:07] from from a man's mind but we're here to
[26:10] hear from you lord
[26:12] and you have chosen the foolishness of
[26:14] preaching and we accept that way lord
[26:16] and we trust you in it
[26:17] we just pray that you would do what not
[26:19] the natural things but the supernatural
[26:21] things this morning
[26:22] that you would speak through these lips
[26:24] of clay that you would take a gift that
[26:26] you've ordained and placed
[26:27] inside a vessel and that you would pick
[26:29] it up lord with your own hands
[26:31] and you would begin to break the bread
[26:32] of life and open our eyes that we might
[26:34] see you lord
[26:36] we might see you in us in this day we
[26:38] might understand like we've never
[26:40] understood before
[26:41] the revelation of what's going on we
[26:44] trust you and ask you have preeminence
[26:46] in all of us
[26:47] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[26:50] you can all be seated if we could
[26:53] turn to matthew chapter one we just want
[26:56] to read the beginning
[26:57] matthew chapter one again i'd like to
[27:00] say
[27:01] wednesday night we we looked into the
[27:02] life of tamar
[27:04] and i realize as we move on from taymor
[27:07] that we could probably stay there for
[27:09] quite some time
[27:10] there's so many little nuggets in there
[27:13] and and
[27:14] i'll tell you this and and it's probably
[27:18] absolutely the truth i believe it to be
[27:20] the truth but if time continues on as it
[27:22] is and god allows us to remain in this
[27:24] condition without the translation of the
[27:26] body
[27:26] we'll come back to this and understand
[27:28] it better
[27:30] i mean we looked through tamar and all
[27:31] of a sudden things were popping out and
[27:33] it was amazing
[27:34] that we could see those church ages
[27:36] right there in genesis 38 it was amazing
[27:38] the things that were there
[27:39] but what's more amazing to me is the
[27:40] things that's still hidden there
[27:43] and you know it's there but you can't
[27:45] make anything up you can't pretend
[27:47] you can't take your own intellectual
[27:49] knife and whittle something down
[27:50] and make it fit in a place that doesn't
[27:52] belong we can't do that
[27:54] and so until revelation comes you just
[27:56] have to leave it alone
[27:58] you can read it and you can look over it
[27:59] but how many times have we read it and
[28:01] looked over
[28:02] and never saw what was laying right
[28:04] there in plain view
[28:06] i mean it's like we're walking over
[28:07] diamonds that are laying on the ground
[28:09] and we haven't realized that they're
[28:10] diamonds amen and one day
[28:12] it just strikes you funny you're at a
[28:14] certain angle the light hits just right
[28:16] it sparkles a certain way and you
[28:18] realize
[28:18] that's a diamond i've been walking past
[28:20] for years
[28:22] and that's what's happening as we walk
[28:24] through the scriptures amen
[28:25] i've said it like this as the eagles
[28:27] catch an updraft they just begin
[28:29] circling
[28:30] amen and every time you circle you go
[28:32] higher so you go back through tamar
[28:33] again you just go higher
[28:35] you go back through the shadows and
[28:36] types and you just go higher
[28:38] more revelation more revelation deeper
[28:40] understanding
[28:41] something moving from our head to our
[28:43] hearts amen and becoming who we are
[28:47] and so so we move on from tamar not
[28:49] because we're done
[28:51] but because we're moving on because
[28:53] we're following the spirit amen
[28:55] but i'm sure we'll go back at some point
[28:58] so let's read in matthew chapter one
[29:00] starting at verse one
[29:03] the book of the generations of jesus
[29:06] christ the son of david the son of
[29:08] abraham
[29:09] abraham begot isaac and isaac begot
[29:11] jacob and jacob begot judas and his
[29:13] brethren
[29:14] and judas begot pharas so that's where
[29:17] we were talking last time
[29:18] pharaz and zarah of tamar and phara has
[29:21] begot ezram and ezra and begot abraham
[29:24] see what we're following now is we're
[29:26] following the line of the princes of
[29:28] judah
[29:28] amen in the each generation there's a
[29:30] prince in judah
[29:32] and out of them is coming another prince
[29:33] and another prince and another prince
[29:35] and this is the generation of jesus
[29:38] christ
[29:39] and the natural as he's coming down this
[29:41] natural
[29:42] lineage of judah because we learned
[29:44] wednesday that the scepter was in judah
[29:46] the governor the ruler must come from
[29:49] judah
[29:50] and so we can see that god is doing
[29:52] something
[29:53] special in judah and we saw through
[29:55] tamar how
[29:56] he brought in this woman and and how you
[29:59] know she has to go through these three
[30:01] stages but
[30:02] never receives the seed till she comes
[30:04] to the fourth and the fourth stage is
[30:06] not another son amen we know these
[30:09] stages were justification sanctification
[30:11] the baptism of holy ghost
[30:12] and these were all works of the holy
[30:15] ghost
[30:16] right justification is the work of the
[30:19] holy ghost sanctification is the work of
[30:21] the holy ghost the baptism holy ghost is
[30:22] a work of the holy ghost amen but she's
[30:24] not coming to another work of the holy
[30:27] ghost
[30:27] but she's coming back to the holy ghost
[30:29] itself
[30:31] not to another son not to another work
[30:33] not to another stage of grace
[30:35] and remember she's gone through the
[30:36] stages of grace through the three sons
[30:38] and now she's coming back to the grace
[30:41] giver amen
[30:42] not a stage of grace but back to life
[30:45] itself
[30:46] back to the originator of the sons
[30:50] back to judah and in that
[30:53] she produces another prince
[30:58] in judah pharas so out of her
[31:02] comes fair as the continuation of this
[31:04] lineage
[31:05] where the scepter must rise out of comes
[31:07] through this whole
[31:08] scenario and we can see so clearly now
[31:12] that it's just the church ages on
[31:14] display it's just the coming of the
[31:16] bride
[31:16] it's just more so as we begin to look
[31:19] through here amen it's always going to
[31:20] be this way
[31:21] and as you look through the shadows and
[31:23] types amen can you imagine
[31:25] like we said on the road to emmaus that
[31:27] beginning at moses and all the prophets
[31:29] amen
[31:29] he showed them in all the scriptures
[31:33] the things that were concerning himself
[31:35] so he shows them in all the scriptures
[31:37] but they're not just repeating
[31:39] scriptures they're not just repeating
[31:40] stories
[31:41] something different happens in each
[31:43] shadow something different happens in
[31:44] each time
[31:45] and it's pointing out other aspects of
[31:47] himself amen
[31:49] other traits other characteristics so
[31:51] that he can be fully
[31:52] identified because brother ben said he
[31:54] was always letting the secret out
[31:56] amen he was constantly unfolding the
[31:58] secret but never
[32:00] letting it out in full through moses and
[32:03] through david and through all these ones
[32:04] they were all showing it in a type they
[32:07] were showing
[32:08] a different aspect of redemption a
[32:10] different aspect but they could never
[32:12] show the whole thing
[32:13] until jesus himself comes and he can
[32:15] show the whole thing
[32:18] and the same thing with the revelation
[32:20] of the bride amen each one is showing a
[32:22] type
[32:23] or a portion they're telling the same
[32:25] story
[32:26] over and over but each one's painting
[32:28] with different colors amen
[32:29] and never could the whole thing been
[32:31] shown until you get to the capstone
[32:34] of this masterpiece this mystery
[32:36] masterpiece which is a masterpiece
[32:38] family amen and the masterpiece wasn't
[32:41] finished when jesus was expressed on
[32:43] earth and went to calvary
[32:45] no that was the first part of the
[32:47] masterpiece family
[32:48] that was fully expressed but out of him
[32:51] was taking a piece off of the original
[32:53] and began to form amen another
[32:56] amen masterpiece another part of the
[32:59] masterpiece
[33:00] which is the woman amen because it's a
[33:02] masterpiece
[33:03] family so christ is the masterpiece
[33:07] but it's christ male and female
[33:10] makes up the masterpiece all the way
[33:14] back
[33:14] amen to the mystery laying in genesis
[33:16] chapter 1
[33:19] of the man and the woman and the
[33:21] masterpiece
[33:22] so now along now as we look
[33:25] back amen we look back at all the
[33:29] scriptures
[33:31] in all the scriptures
[33:34] if the bridegroom is there
[33:38] the bride's there too
[33:42] this is such an interesting thing we've
[33:44] come
[33:45] amen at the end of time when we thought
[33:47] that we've had
[33:48] thousands of years to study the bible
[33:51] we've come through the man age amen and
[33:53] when you come through the man age
[33:54] it was god giving men wisdom amen to
[33:57] print the bible
[33:58] to get to the interpretation of the
[34:00] bible to bring us
[34:02] out of the of the of the death camp
[34:05] of the catholic church doing away at the
[34:07] bible so god sent an anointing
[34:09] amen which is the was a man anointing
[34:11] which is the intelligence of a man
[34:13] so that he can print bibles read bibles
[34:15] amen and break that stronghold of the
[34:17] catholic church
[34:18] but the problem is they went too far on
[34:21] that anointing
[34:22] and refused the eagle anointing and
[34:24] wanted to stay with the
[34:25] intellect and wisdom of a man and began
[34:28] to then
[34:29] interpret the word by intellect
[34:33] god gave him that anointing to bring him
[34:35] back to the written word
[34:37] to move him away from superstition to
[34:39] move him away from fairy tales that the
[34:41] church had made up
[34:42] and come back to the written word so he
[34:44] gave him the intelligence to print it
[34:46] to distribute it to translate it to read
[34:48] it
[34:49] and come back to the word amen and that
[34:51] should have brought them right to the
[34:53] eagle anointing
[34:54] to give them the prophetic vision to see
[34:56] the story
[34:57] in the story to see the shadows and the
[35:00] types
[35:01] amen and not just get hung up on the
[35:03] correct print
[35:04] and the correct spot the ink blotch is
[35:07] all making sense
[35:08] and then it's more than just the ink
[35:10] blotches getting in the right spot
[35:12] it's more than just having an accurate
[35:14] translation that's important
[35:16] but we come to the eagle age not to get
[35:18] an accurate
[35:19] verbatim translation from the latin into
[35:22] the
[35:23] english that's not what we're after
[35:24] we're not looking for an exact
[35:26] verbatim translation we're looking for
[35:29] the revelation
[35:31] of what that scripture means
[35:34] it's more than a correct translation now
[35:37] we had to come through the stage of
[35:39] correct translation which is the man age
[35:41] that's important but the problem is they
[35:43] stuck
[35:44] right there and now they're arguing over
[35:48] correct translations and arguing over
[35:51] versions of the bible and arguing over
[35:54] critical
[35:55] uh text and all these other stuff
[35:57] textual criticism and all this
[35:59] arguing over and all it was supposed to
[36:01] do is get the word right back in place
[36:03] and then so the prophet could come and
[36:04] give us the proper interpretation of it
[36:06] all
[36:08] so now we come back to the end of this
[36:11] and we've we've been looking for
[36:12] thousands of years and studying and
[36:14] putting the bible together and and it
[36:16] was it was put together and it was lost
[36:18] and
[36:18] and then god brought it back amen
[36:20] through the dark ages
[36:21] and in all all of this we see
[36:25] jesus christ jesus christ jesus christ
[36:28] the redeemer the redeemer the redeemer
[36:31] but we come to the end of time and a
[36:33] prophet comes
[36:34] and says i want to show you more of the
[36:37] mystery
[36:38] there's been more mystery laying there
[36:42] praise god i never know how this is
[36:45] going to go but we're just
[36:47] when when we look down we're going to go
[36:50] in just a minute
[36:51] over to joshua amen and we're going to
[36:54] start in joshua chapter 2
[36:56] and start looking at the life of rahab
[36:59] but when we get in there this is not
[37:00] something i was going to go into but i
[37:01] just want to share this right here
[37:03] when we get into this you're going to
[37:06] find out that they crossed jordan and in
[37:08] order to cross
[37:09] jordan amen there's some instructions
[37:11] that that that the captain of the lord's
[37:13] army gave unto joshua
[37:15] and joshua carries this out and so now
[37:18] they've got to take the word that the
[37:19] prophet brought
[37:22] god's word that the prophet brought was
[37:24] put into the ark amen
[37:26] and the ark could only be carried by the
[37:29] priest
[37:30] so now the word was brought by a prophet
[37:34] but that word could never move forward
[37:37] there's no moving forward without the
[37:39] priesthood
[37:41] so without the ministry amen and we
[37:43] found out that it's a god called
[37:45] ministry not a man called
[37:46] ministry because when when moses had
[37:49] chosen
[37:50] when god had directed moses to choose
[37:54] aaron and his sons to be the priest and
[37:56] then everybody went into a tissy
[37:58] saying how can you pick your brother
[38:00] we're all we're there's 12
[38:02] princes 12 tribes why didn't we get a
[38:04] vote
[38:06] why didn't we i mean i feel like i could
[38:09] do just as good a job as aaron could do
[38:12] amen i feel like that i'm just as
[38:15] qualified or
[38:16] i'm part of i'm you know i'm a son also
[38:21] i'm a prince in israel also i feel like
[38:23] i have just as much
[38:24] opportunity and so and so god says every
[38:27] man bring his staff
[38:29] bring his rod amen representing a tribe
[38:31] bring them in and scribe your name on
[38:33] here
[38:33] and lay them in the sanctuary amen and
[38:35] god come in and he says
[38:36] the one that that blooms and brings
[38:39] forth and buds
[38:40] that's the one i've chosen and they
[38:41] bring him out the next day
[38:43] and aaron's rod bloomed amen it budded
[38:46] and it bore
[38:47] fruit amen the rest of them were dead
[38:50] dead dead dead dead but one could bring
[38:54] forth fruit
[38:57] amen in the ministry the true god called
[39:00] ministry
[39:01] can bring forth fruit amen not by their
[39:03] own power
[39:04] they're just a dead stick but the
[39:07] presence of god
[39:08] overshadows the gift amen and there's a
[39:11] certain lineage amen
[39:12] and now it's not a family it doesn't
[39:14] pass from father to son to father to son
[39:17] but by god's own choosing and
[39:19] predestination
[39:20] he has chosen where it's at and now he
[39:22] comes over a
[39:23] dead stick that's incapable of doing
[39:26] anything on its own
[39:30] this is really good for preachers to
[39:32] remember
[39:33] a dead stick amen that had been picked
[39:36] up that had fallen dead somewhere that
[39:38] must have been
[39:39] it may have been an almond tree at one
[39:41] point a limb or a branch off an almond
[39:43] tree
[39:44] that was now a staff or a walking stick
[39:46] for aaron
[39:47] it was dead it could not produce life
[39:50] there's nothing it can do
[39:51] but this one is the one that's ordained
[39:54] amen
[39:54] and then the sanctuary of god in the
[39:56] presence of god
[39:58] he can overshadow a dead stick and not
[40:00] only bud
[40:01] and bloom it can bring forth fruit again
[40:06] so there's no way we're going to get
[40:08] away from a fifo ministry no
[40:10] matter how many people in the ministry
[40:12] mess up
[40:14] no matter how many preachers fail no
[40:16] matter how many people they deceive
[40:18] no matter how many lives are derailed
[40:20] because of preachers
[40:21] we're never going to get away from a
[40:24] five full ministry
[40:26] until we come to the translation of the
[40:28] body it's god's ordained way
[40:30] so now they come to cross into the
[40:32] promised land moses has brought him this
[40:34] far
[40:34] the prophet of god has given them the
[40:36] word of god amen they've
[40:38] got it he's given them instructions they
[40:39] know what to do with it and now
[40:41] joshua amen is coming and he's given
[40:43] instructions
[40:44] now joshua is giving instructions to the
[40:47] levites
[40:50] and they're saying we've got the cross
[40:52] but jordan is overflowing its banks in
[40:54] the time of harvest
[40:56] amen so now you you you ministers
[40:59] you take the ark because you're the ones
[41:02] that carry the ark
[41:03] and we've got to make forward progress
[41:06] amen
[41:07] and mo and joshua tells the people stay
[41:10] back
[41:14] stay back and you watch keep a distance
[41:17] and
[41:18] watch where they're going because you've
[41:21] never been this way before
[41:31] you be careful that you don't get ahead
[41:35] of the word
[41:38] be careful that you don't get ahead
[41:41] of the ministry don't jump out there in
[41:44] front of a levite
[41:48] be careful that you watch
[41:51] and see what happens
[41:55] because this is god's way and we can't
[41:58] change god's way
[42:00] and so they go down and they
[42:04] they they take the ark and they go down
[42:06] in the jordan and they're supposed to go
[42:07] right
[42:08] into the water they're supposed to wade
[42:12] right into the water
[42:13] and they go right into the water and
[42:14] when they do the the water stops flowing
[42:17] down
[42:18] from the mountains in jordan and it
[42:19] pulls back and now
[42:21] everybody crosses on dry land so now as
[42:24] long as the ministry is in the river
[42:26] amen they can pass through as long as
[42:28] they're holding the word in place they
[42:30] can pass through and pass through and
[42:31] pass through until the last one gets
[42:34] across
[42:36] how long are you going to need the
[42:37] ministry until the last one gets across
[42:41] and when the last one gets across joshua
[42:44] says now
[42:45] come up out and when they come up out
[42:47] amen the water flows back over
[42:50] now i told you all this not to tell you
[42:52] that but to tell you something else
[42:55] so pay attention now before the priests
[42:59] come out of the water something happens
[43:00] now remember
[43:01] we're talking about the mystery of
[43:02] christ that was laying in the bible
[43:04] and now we've had years to explore that
[43:06] jesus tells the disciples on the road to
[43:08] the mass and he teaches them in
[43:10] all the scriptures of things concerning
[43:11] himself remember i said we've come to
[43:13] the end now
[43:14] and in the end there's a prophet of god
[43:17] here to go
[43:17] back over the same scriptures
[43:23] and show that there's a bride there too
[43:26] there's a bridegroom we've known there's
[43:27] a bridegroom there
[43:29] we've known he's been there in types i
[43:30] mean we know it types this and types
[43:32] that but he goes back and shows that
[43:33] there's a bride there too
[43:36] and we come down to the to the
[43:38] revelation chapter 10 and we know that
[43:40] there's a seven thunders and we know
[43:42] john was told not to write the things
[43:43] that the seven thunders had said
[43:45] but to seal them up and so we know that
[43:47] there's something else that's sealed
[43:49] up that we saw the opening of the seals
[43:53] in symbol
[43:54] form but when the thunder spoke
[43:55] something was sealed up that wasn't
[43:57] revealed
[43:58] and so you know you have you have two
[44:00] sets of seals brother branham says
[44:04] you have the seals that were broken
[44:06] simple form white horse red horse but
[44:08] then you have the interpretation or the
[44:10] revelation of what those seals was in
[44:11] the seven thunders
[44:12] but john was forbidden to write so they
[44:15] were sealed up
[44:16] and they were not written and brother
[44:19] bam said
[44:20] see like in jeremiah go back and read it
[44:24] in jeremiah
[44:25] because when jeremiah was going to
[44:27] redeem a part of land
[44:29] he paid a price in silver the price of
[44:31] redemption to redeem a part
[44:33] and they took two documents to record
[44:35] the transaction
[44:37] and the deed and everything that went
[44:39] along with redemption
[44:41] of the land amen which is a type of the
[44:43] word
[44:45] and they had one that was sealed in a
[44:47] vessel and one was open
[44:49] you have an open record and a sealed
[44:52] record
[44:52] and when the time came for them to come
[44:54] back out of babylon
[44:56] he does this just before they go into
[44:58] babylon just before they go
[44:59] amen into the dark ages and they fall
[45:01] into the babylonian catholicism and
[45:04] denominationalism but when it's time to
[45:06] return back to the land
[45:10] there's two documents that they have to
[45:12] compare and when they compare these two
[45:14] documents and the two documents line up
[45:16] it proved who's in the redemption what's
[45:18] included in the redemption
[45:20] who has redemption rights who bought it
[45:22] who sealed it who did everything
[45:24] and it's in these two documents now you
[45:26] have an open document that anybody can
[45:28] read at any time
[45:29] but there's a sealed document and this
[45:32] seal can only be broken by somebody
[45:34] qualified to break the seal
[45:37] amen and the seal will signify who's
[45:40] qualified amen
[45:41] and they when there's a qualified person
[45:44] and all parties amen all
[45:47] parties are on the scene that's required
[45:50] to open this document
[45:51] then the document is open because
[45:54] somebody could have misinterpreted the
[45:56] open document
[45:58] somebody could have tampered with the
[46:00] open document but
[46:01] this one that's been sealed amen sealed
[46:04] before the church went
[46:06] in to the church ages sealed before it
[46:08] fell
[46:09] into adultery amen and went into
[46:10] babylonian before that
[46:13] this was sealed and if you pull it out
[46:15] and these two records
[46:16] match now you know who's in the
[46:19] redemption
[46:20] who paid the price who did the ceiling
[46:22] who opens it up
[46:23] now everything is revealed with these
[46:25] two documents
[46:27] one's open one sealed one's there one's
[46:30] a mystery
[46:33] so now this isn't even about hey rahab
[46:37] god bless you we love you you're doing a
[46:39] good job pulling for everybody else amen
[46:42] amen there must be somebody on the
[46:43] internet somewhere spilling coffee on
[46:45] themselves right now amen getting
[46:46] excited
[46:50] praise god
[46:53] so now when you when you pick up this
[46:56] story
[46:57] now let's just go let's just go to
[46:59] joshua chapter 1.
[47:03] see these things that the prophet taught
[47:04] us they've been laying in the bible the
[47:07] whole time
[47:09] see now the prophet's not making stuff
[47:10] up and this is why we have to be
[47:13] so very careful with the message
[47:18] because it's so easy to hear the prophet
[47:21] say something that's
[47:22] different than the way we believe it to
[47:24] be in our minds
[47:26] and we automatically subconsciously
[47:30] without even knowing it or doing an
[47:32] autocorrect to what he's saying
[47:36] and not on purpose not because we're
[47:38] trying to be deceitful not
[47:39] but just because we've always understood
[47:42] it a certain way
[47:43] he says something and automatically we
[47:46] bring a correction to what he says
[47:48] but we're not trying to do wrong there's
[47:51] no
[47:52] attempt to be evil it's just i didn't
[47:54] understand it that way
[47:55] instead of taking exactly what he says
[47:58] we take what we think he says
[48:03] so when we go that's why that's why we
[48:06] said it again i'll say it a thousand
[48:07] times
[48:08] brother bam said above everything else
[48:09] pray for revelation
[48:12] because that revelation all of a sudden
[48:14] you'll read you'll be reading the
[48:15] message
[48:15] and you know you've read this message
[48:17] you know you've read it dozens of times
[48:19] you can see where you've marked it up
[48:21] and then all of a sudden you read it
[48:22] it's like
[48:23] what did he just say
[48:26] i've never read that before i mean i've
[48:29] read it but i've never read it
[48:33] and it's all in the wording
[48:38] sometimes it's all in the wording
[48:41] and it can be hidden in the wording
[48:45] and it can be hidden in a seventh grade
[48:47] grammar
[48:50] it can be hidden there and all of a
[48:52] sudden you know
[48:54] you've been correcting it to proper
[48:55] grammar when god never wanted it proper
[48:57] grammar
[49:00] god never wanted to be correct he didn't
[49:02] want to be modernized he didn't want it
[49:04] to be
[49:04] uh proper grammar he wanted it said just
[49:07] like it was said
[49:09] but because of our education amen we've
[49:12] been
[49:12] correcting the grammar automatically
[49:14] unintentionally
[49:16] and sometimes you're going to go back
[49:17] and just take him for what he said
[49:20] hallelujah so now
[49:24] let's come to joshua
[49:30] chapter four i don't even have notes on
[49:33] this so i don't
[49:34] i don't i'm just gonna have to find it
[49:44] okay they're getting ready to cross over
[49:49] chapter 4 verse 4. then joshua called
[49:52] the 12 men whom he had prepared of the
[49:54] children of israel out of every tribe a
[49:56] man
[49:57] and joshua said unto them passover
[49:59] before the ark of the lord your god
[50:01] in the midst of jordan and take ye up
[50:04] every man of you a stone upon his
[50:06] shoulder
[50:06] according to the number of the tribes of
[50:08] the children of israel
[50:10] that this may be a sign among you that
[50:12] when your children ask their fathers in
[50:14] time to come
[50:15] saying what mean ye by these stones then
[50:17] you shall answer them that the waters of
[50:19] jordan were cut off before the ark of
[50:21] the covenant of the lord
[50:23] then it passed with it when it passed
[50:25] over jordan
[50:26] the waters of jordan were cut off and
[50:27] these stones shall be for a memorial
[50:30] unto the children of israel forever
[50:33] and the children of israel did so as
[50:35] joshua commanded and took up
[50:36] 12 stones out of the midst of jordan as
[50:39] the lord spoken to joshua according to
[50:41] the number
[50:42] of the tribes of the children of israel
[50:44] and carried them over with them
[50:46] unto the place where they lodged and
[50:47] laid them down there
[50:49] and joshua set up 12 stones
[50:53] watch this and joshua set up 12 stones
[50:56] in the midst of jordan
[51:00] in the middle of jordan and the place
[51:04] where the feet of the priest which bear
[51:06] the ark of the covenant stood
[51:08] and they are there unto this
[51:12] day so let's pay close attention to this
[51:16] we're coming across he tells 12 men
[51:18] which are out of the 12 tribes
[51:20] each of you bear up a stone and take the
[51:22] stone
[51:23] across jordan with you and we're going
[51:24] to build a memorial so that when your
[51:26] children's children ask what mean these
[51:28] stones
[51:29] you can tell them about this crossing
[51:30] this day
[51:32] so now there's going to be a public
[51:34] record made
[51:37] and and joshua takes those 12 stones
[51:39] they erect those 12 stones
[51:41] and they become a pillar amen and that
[51:43] pillar becomes a monument for
[51:45] all of israel to know that this is where
[51:48] it crossed this is where we crossed on
[51:49] dry
[51:50] land this is what happened but because
[51:52] there has to be
[51:53] two records why does there have to be
[51:56] two records because of revelation
[51:57] chapter 10
[51:59] that's why joshua had two records sealed
[52:01] in an open this is the open record
[52:03] so now before the priests come out of
[52:06] jordan
[52:07] joshua goes back in to where the priests
[52:10] are standing on dry ground
[52:12] in the midst in the middle of jordan and
[52:15] he takes there
[52:16] and he builds a pillar of 12 stones
[52:20] in the midst in the middle of jordan and
[52:22] when he's done
[52:24] he tells the priest now to walk out and
[52:26] the waters flow
[52:28] over it and now there's a mystery hidden
[52:31] in the waters
[52:32] [Applause]
[52:34] there's a mystery hidden in jordan
[52:38] in the waters in the word is laying a
[52:40] mystery amen
[52:42] there's the record that's public
[52:44] everybody can see it
[52:45] everybody can look at it and then you
[52:47] can hear that joshua
[52:49] also put 12 more in the river but you
[52:52] don't know what they are
[52:53] because all you heard was that seven
[52:55] thunders uttered their voice
[52:56] and they were told not to write you
[52:58] don't know what it looks like you don't
[52:59] know what orders it's in you don't know
[53:00] which names are where
[53:01] on those 12 stones you don't know
[53:04] because it's hidden
[53:05] in the word
[53:10] you have a public record and you have a
[53:13] mysterious
[53:14] hidden record
[53:17] and jeremiah and the price of redemption
[53:19] had a public record
[53:20] and he had one sealed in an earthen
[53:22] vessel
[53:23] sealed away from sight with a seal put
[53:27] on
[53:27] and nobody could see that one they
[53:30] believed it was there
[53:31] they could look at the earthen vessel
[53:33] you could look at jordan you could
[53:34] believe that seven thunders uttered
[53:36] their voices
[53:37] but what is written in the clay vessel
[53:41] what is stacked in the middle of jordan
[53:43] they've told me what it was
[53:45] it's in the word but it's going to take
[53:47] something supernatural
[53:49] amen to reveal what's there
[53:54] hallelujah now you see the message
[53:58] brother branham came amen it came and it
[54:01] wasn't so much that brother branham came
[54:04] it was that the redeemer came the sealer
[54:07] came
[54:08] because it's got to be the one who's
[54:10] able to break the seal
[54:13] until you have somebody on the scene and
[54:16] all the conditions are met
[54:18] for breaking the seal you cannot break
[54:21] the seal
[54:22] but you've got to come to a time into a
[54:25] place
[54:25] where all parties that must be present
[54:28] are present
[54:29] [Applause]
[54:32] hallelujah and you have to have somebody
[54:35] with the authority to break the seal
[54:38] so you tell me who's got the authority
[54:41] to break the seal on these seven
[54:42] thunders
[54:44] the same one who uttered them the same
[54:46] mighty angel that came down in
[54:48] revelation
[54:48] he's the only one with the authority to
[54:51] break those seals
[54:52] and tell us what those seven thunders
[54:54] are and they found out that brother man
[54:56] thought they would be seven additional
[54:59] seals or seven additional
[55:01] mysteries but he said i found out that
[55:05] was wrong
[55:05] is something that's already got to be
[55:08] hidden
[55:08] under the waters in jordan it's already
[55:12] there
[55:12] it's been there the whole time amen it's
[55:15] never
[55:16] moved it's always been in the word amen
[55:18] but it takes a prophet
[55:20] to tell us what's there
[55:23] it took the one who parted the waters
[55:26] amen
[55:26] he's the only one now that can tell us
[55:29] what's under the water
[55:31] and who parted the water it wasn't
[55:33] joshua it wasn't the levites amen it was
[55:35] god himself
[55:39] and he's the only one that can tell us
[55:40] what's hidden under the waters
[55:43] you can look at jordan you can fish in
[55:45] jordan every once in a while you can
[55:46] bring a lure across it and bump
[55:47] something and you will wonder
[55:49] i wonder if that's one of those 12
[55:50] stones or not but you don't know
[55:52] you can read the bible you can ponder at
[55:54] it you can wonder
[55:55] i wonder if that's the mystery i wonder
[55:57] if that's it i kind of feel it amen
[56:00] all sudden jordan gets low one year
[56:03] and there's a certain funny little
[56:05] ripple in the water
[56:07] out there in the middle you wanna i
[56:08] wonder if that can be them amen you
[56:10] can't know
[56:11] until the revealer shows up and tells
[56:13] you what's there
[56:15] they can be probed at they can be felt
[56:18] around that but not revealed until this
[56:20] last day
[56:22] so all the way here in joshua you've got
[56:26] this
[56:28] open and sealed mystery
[56:31] you have this open and sealed monument
[56:36] because what are the seven thunders they
[56:38] are the revelation of the sevens
[56:40] contained in the seven seals
[56:42] what's contained in the seven seals the
[56:44] mystery of redemption
[56:47] how he would redeem who would he redeem
[56:49] who falls into what category and
[56:51] redemption
[56:52] it's all laying there
[56:55] amen so what was this monument
[56:59] the monument was the redemption of the
[57:01] people coming into the land
[57:03] who's included the 12 tribes how did
[57:06] they get here
[57:07] right at this spot through jordan
[57:09] through the cross
[57:10] the monument tells the story of
[57:12] redemption
[57:15] and that's what the thunders are telling
[57:17] us the mystery of redemption
[57:20] hallelujah so that was all bonus
[57:23] material praise god
[57:26] so we find out in matthew chapter 1 i'll
[57:30] just read it to you don't have to go
[57:31] back because i made you turn to joshua
[57:32] already and we're coming right back to
[57:33] joshua too
[57:35] but it says
[57:39] that judas begot fair as in zero of
[57:41] tamar
[57:42] and pharaohs begot israel and ezra and
[57:44] begotten aram and abraham began a
[57:45] minidab
[57:46] and a meaning that begot nehe's son and
[57:48] nassen begot solomon
[57:52] now it's interesting
[57:57] that so many things happen
[58:00] between pharah's coming
[58:03] and solomon coming because
[58:07] pharas was there pharaz was one of those
[58:12] that went down with jacob into egypt
[58:16] so pharas goes goes down into
[58:19] egypt when jacob goes when joseph
[58:22] summons for his brothers to come
[58:24] amen he's one of that generation that
[58:26] comes judah comes
[58:27] pharas comes and all of them and then
[58:30] these are all there
[58:32] these generations are all laying there
[58:33] in bondage so it's amazing we have this
[58:36] story
[58:37] of this woman tamar that shows up but
[58:40] you notice they don't show they don't
[58:42] mention another woman until you get to
[58:44] salman
[58:45] who marries rahab and what happens
[58:48] between
[58:49] tamar and rahab they go down into egypt
[58:52] the type of the world
[58:55] they go into bondage this is all typing
[58:58] the church again
[58:59] she goes amen into the church ages she
[59:01] goes into bondage
[59:02] she comes under cruel taskmasters of
[59:05] demons that are forcing her into a
[59:07] forced religion
[59:08] into all kinds of creeds and dogmas and
[59:10] ideas of man
[59:11] and work systems and all of this stuff
[59:13] and they go down in there
[59:14] amen and they're brought out with a
[59:16] mighty hand amen and they wander through
[59:18] the wilderness but now
[59:20] we've got solomon and solomon is coming
[59:22] into the land
[59:23] which means solomon is part of this new
[59:25] generation
[59:26] this new generation not dying in the
[59:28] wilderness not in bondage down in egypt
[59:30] but this new generation is going to take
[59:32] the land
[59:33] so now you have a prince in judah that's
[59:35] part of the generation
[59:36] that's going to see the fulfillment of
[59:38] the promise given to
[59:39] abraham abraham's covenant for this
[59:43] natural land
[59:44] now he's coming into the covenant and
[59:46] when he comes into the covenant he's got
[59:48] to have a wife as he comes into the
[59:50] covenant
[59:52] what kind of wife do you think he's
[59:53] going to get when he's
[59:55] finally coming into the promise given to
[59:58] abraham
[1:00:00] the same kind of wife that christ gets
[1:00:02] when he's coming into the promise
[1:00:04] when he comes back and he restores all
[1:00:06] that adam's loss he's coming in
[1:00:08] he is the christ see he is the royal
[1:00:10] seed he is the benefactor of the promise
[1:00:13] that's given to abraham
[1:00:14] and when he comes back in to pay the
[1:00:16] price of redemption
[1:00:17] to buy back all that adam lost when he's
[1:00:20] coming into redemption
[1:00:22] now as he's coming in to buy the land
[1:00:24] he's going to have to have a wife
[1:00:26] amen and he's got to have a certain kind
[1:00:28] of wife what wife do you think he'll
[1:00:30] pick
[1:00:33] he'll pick the harlot in jericho
[1:00:38] hallelujah amen that makes me feel so
[1:00:41] good
[1:00:41] i didn't have to be in a perfect lineage
[1:00:44] i didn't have to be in the perfect spot
[1:00:46] i don't have to be third generation
[1:00:47] message believer to make it
[1:00:50] i don't have to have a clean life i
[1:00:52] don't have to always believe the right
[1:00:54] thing
[1:00:56] i could have been in idolatry in the
[1:00:59] catholic church
[1:00:59] i could have been wrapped up in all
[1:01:01] kinds of immorality i could have been in
[1:01:03] every way
[1:01:04] amen but when solomon comes amen
[1:01:07] he's coming as the prince of the tribe
[1:01:11] of judah he's one of the twelve princes
[1:01:14] he may have been the one that was
[1:01:15] carrying one of the twelve stones across
[1:01:17] jordan for all we know but one of the
[1:01:19] twelve princes of
[1:01:20] israel he's a prince in the house of
[1:01:23] judah and out of him
[1:01:24] is coming the lineage of christ amen and
[1:01:27] now he's got to have
[1:01:28] at the time of redemption the time
[1:01:31] of the fulfillment of the promise the
[1:01:33] time of crossing jordan amen
[1:01:36] at this time he's got to have a wife and
[1:01:38] he cannot
[1:01:39] take an angel he cannot take a cherub
[1:01:43] but he's got to go back and he's got to
[1:01:45] take
[1:01:46] a gentile woman trapped in the system of
[1:01:49] denomination
[1:01:50] and bring her out with a mighty hand
[1:01:55] so when you see christ and solomon
[1:01:57] coming into the land
[1:02:01] when christ is coming into the land
[1:02:06] he's going to have to have a bride
[1:02:11] so what kind of bride is he going to
[1:02:14] have
[1:02:16] hallelujah oh we're still preaching
[1:02:20] out of the first six verses of matthew
[1:02:25] the bible brother branham said it's a
[1:02:28] love letter
[1:02:30] you've got to read between the lines
[1:02:33] the only way you can understand the love
[1:02:36] letter
[1:02:38] is to be in the same mind as the one who
[1:02:40] wrote it
[1:02:44] you cannot you know i use this analogy
[1:02:47] before
[1:02:48] you could be walking through the store
[1:02:49] and you can find a folded up piece of
[1:02:51] paper with a heart drawn on the outside
[1:02:53] and you can pick it up and you can read
[1:02:55] it amen and all of a sudden you're
[1:02:56] reading about some sweetheart
[1:02:58] amen some man writing to his sweetheart
[1:03:00] and he's writing
[1:03:01] and he's expressing between the lines
[1:03:04] little innuendos and little phrases that
[1:03:06] only the two of them will understand
[1:03:09] he'll be like remember that day we went
[1:03:10] to the park oh what a day that was
[1:03:14] well you're reading in like i don't
[1:03:15] remember going to the park i have no
[1:03:16] idea
[1:03:18] what was what's what's so exciting about
[1:03:19] this and you can see three exclamation
[1:03:22] parts at the end
[1:03:23] so you know there's something amazing
[1:03:25] about that day in the park
[1:03:26] but i have no clue what it is
[1:03:30] he further on and he says you remember
[1:03:32] what i told you the other day my
[1:03:34] plan for the future amen everything's
[1:03:36] working just right on track
[1:03:37] i got a job and now i'm able to put a
[1:03:39] down payment on an apartment and very
[1:03:41] soon what i promise you is going to come
[1:03:43] to pass
[1:03:45] and he says remember when i told you
[1:03:46] what you meant to me and remember when i
[1:03:48] used and he might use a little pet term
[1:03:50] that only she understands
[1:03:55] you can pick up this letter and start
[1:03:57] reading this letter
[1:03:58] and you can start giggling because it's
[1:04:00] silly
[1:04:02] doesn't make sense and this is funny to
[1:04:04] you it's a joke
[1:04:07] or to you it's nonsense or to you it's
[1:04:10] uncomprehendable
[1:04:13] but if the one it was intended for ever
[1:04:15] picked up that note
[1:04:17] she would be able to read all the things
[1:04:20] that are not
[1:04:20] written she would know
[1:04:24] what the three exclamation points mean
[1:04:27] she would know what the plan is she
[1:04:29] would know what having a job in a down
[1:04:31] payment mean
[1:04:31] she would know what the pet term
[1:04:33] represents she would realize
[1:04:35] everything that he's writing because
[1:04:37] she's been in contact with the
[1:04:39] sweetheart
[1:04:40] amen he's whispered sweet nothing's in
[1:04:42] her ear amen
[1:04:43] and she's been the revealer of the
[1:04:45] secrets to her
[1:04:46] and she's got the same mind he has
[1:04:49] and now as she reads the same thing
[1:04:52] anybody else can read
[1:04:53] it means nothing to them it's a joke
[1:04:55] it's silly
[1:04:56] it's meaningless it's pointless but to
[1:04:58] her it's a great
[1:05:00] revelation it's telling her things that
[1:05:04] only she will know
[1:05:05] now she's seeing things that only she
[1:05:06] can understand talking about the past
[1:05:09] explaining the present and words for the
[1:05:11] future
[1:05:12] all in the same notes
[1:05:16] that's what this is
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:19] tons of people can pick it up
[1:05:24] they can become code breakers
[1:05:27] and start breaking down the code of the
[1:05:29] three exclamation points
[1:05:32] and breaking down the code of the
[1:05:34] fragmented sentences and the little pet
[1:05:36] words and
[1:05:37] oh he called her he called her booboo
[1:05:40] well b is the second letter in the
[1:05:42] alphabet oh and i
[1:05:46] that's how people read the bible
[1:05:50] back in the the etymology of this word
[1:05:53] goes back into the greek and
[1:05:54] that's how people read the bible but the
[1:05:58] bible is not to be discerned that way
[1:06:01] the bible is not to be interpreted the
[1:06:03] bible is written
[1:06:04] for the believer
[1:06:07] and only the believer will understand
[1:06:10] the bible
[1:06:13] i heard this term this term was thrown
[1:06:15] around one time and it absolutely
[1:06:16] infuriated me
[1:06:18] and it's okay to be angry i have a lot
[1:06:21] of good
[1:06:21] bible verses that says god was angry
[1:06:24] and if being angry was a sin then god
[1:06:26] would ascend
[1:06:29] it's what you do with anger that's
[1:06:30] whether he said or not amen
[1:06:32] so being angry but i was infuriated with
[1:06:34] this term
[1:06:35] somebody said message people just don't
[1:06:38] know their bibles very well
[1:06:43] you mean because i don't have them
[1:06:45] memorized in order
[1:06:47] you mean because i i will misquote the
[1:06:51] bible
[1:06:52] and quote it the same way brother
[1:06:53] branham did
[1:06:58] you mean i don't know the bible because
[1:07:00] i don't know it the way the baptist
[1:07:02] scholar knows it
[1:07:05] because i don't know the greek words and
[1:07:06] i don't know the structure and i don't
[1:07:08] know who wrote it i don't know the year
[1:07:09] that this letter was written
[1:07:12] you say i don't know the bible because
[1:07:14] when i repeat stories i tell them the
[1:07:16] way brother branham told them
[1:07:20] you're telling me i don't know the bible
[1:07:23] the only one who can know the bible is
[1:07:26] the bride of jesus christ
[1:07:28] she's the only one that can know the
[1:07:30] bible is the bride of jesus christ so
[1:07:32] don't tell me message people don't know
[1:07:34] their bibles
[1:07:36] they're the only ones who can know their
[1:07:38] bibles true believers
[1:07:40] genuine predestinated elect seed of god
[1:07:42] are the only ones who can know their
[1:07:44] bibles
[1:07:47] that's why schools will fail
[1:07:49] understandings will fail
[1:07:51] books will fail that's why we don't
[1:07:54] write a book on the doctrines that
[1:07:56] brother branham brought
[1:07:58] i could say i'm going to write a book
[1:07:59] all right i'm going to write a book on
[1:08:01] the documents that brother branham
[1:08:02] brought
[1:08:03] he already did that it's called the
[1:08:04] church ages book you don't need to write
[1:08:06] another one
[1:08:08] but i'm going to write a book the
[1:08:09] problem is you're trying to hit a moving
[1:08:11] target
[1:08:14] because he's continually unveiling the
[1:08:16] word to us
[1:08:17] it's going deeper it's getting richer
[1:08:20] we're seeing it i don't just see it here
[1:08:21] but now i see it here and here and here
[1:08:23] and next year i'll see it here here here
[1:08:24] here and here i'm seeing it all over the
[1:08:26] place
[1:08:27] my eyes are becoming open i'm he's
[1:08:29] constantly unveiling himself
[1:08:31] in a greater intimacy and a greater
[1:08:33] intimacy with his bride
[1:08:34] so if you try to write a book on the
[1:08:36] doctors or the teachings of the message
[1:08:38] it's like trying to hit a moving target
[1:08:40] you're going to have to put a revision
[1:08:41] on there every week
[1:08:45] revision 2572 revision you just
[1:08:48] you can't get it amen just stay with the
[1:08:51] message amen stay with the bible
[1:08:53] and let god unveil it let god reveal it
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:58] praise god at some point we're going to
[1:09:01] have to get started into this message
[1:09:03] today
[1:09:05] i think we should have snow storms and a
[1:09:06] limited crowd and everybody pulling
[1:09:08] double
[1:09:09] amen we should do this every week amen
[1:09:14] so we find out that judas begets
[1:09:16] pharaohs of tamar
[1:09:18] and he does this at the same time
[1:09:23] the same time joseph
[1:09:27] gets betrayed by his brothers rejected
[1:09:29] betrayed
[1:09:31] denied and sent out rejected
[1:09:35] sent out is dead so the same time christ
[1:09:38] is rejected
[1:09:40] tamar comes on the scene see how perfect
[1:09:43] this
[1:09:43] is when christ is rejected by his
[1:09:45] brothers when he's assumed for dead
[1:09:47] when he's been sold for nearly 20 pieces
[1:09:50] of silver he sold for 30 pieces of
[1:09:51] silver in the new testament
[1:09:53] now when all this happens now it's time
[1:09:57] for christ the prince of judah
[1:10:00] to get tamar and now no women are
[1:10:04] mentioned for quite a while
[1:10:05] there's no women mentioned but until you
[1:10:08] come to solomon
[1:10:09] and so now as they go down into egypt
[1:10:12] and they
[1:10:12] they get down there under hard labor and
[1:10:14] under taskmasters and all
[1:10:16] these things now when they come up now
[1:10:19] when the new generation comes up the
[1:10:20] prince of the
[1:10:21] house of judah when he goes into the
[1:10:24] land now he goes
[1:10:25] in unmarried amen but through him
[1:10:29] coming into the land he must reproduce
[1:10:31] in the lineage again because this is the
[1:10:33] lineage of jesus christ
[1:10:35] so he can look around at all the
[1:10:37] wonderful tribes and all the wonderful
[1:10:38] church members and everybody that's
[1:10:40] doing wonderful coming into this land
[1:10:42] but he cannot have one of them because
[1:10:44] there's a predestinated woman sitting
[1:10:47] there
[1:10:47] and that predestinated woman is a woman
[1:10:49] with a bad reputation
[1:10:51] a woman of ill fame the wrong woman in
[1:10:54] the wrong place
[1:10:55] at the wrong time is the right woman in
[1:10:58] the right place
[1:10:59] at the right time hallelujah
[1:11:02] many of you that have been been coming
[1:11:04] to the message amen from outside weren't
[1:11:07] raised this way but come in
[1:11:08] you were in the wrong place at the wrong
[1:11:10] time living the wrong kind of life
[1:11:13] in the wrong system or in no system at
[1:11:15] all amen but
[1:11:16] god found you right there because you
[1:11:18] were in the right place
[1:11:20] at the right time amen and you were born
[1:11:22] in the message you're still in the right
[1:11:24] place
[1:11:25] at the right time amen
[1:11:29] you got to recognize this isn't about
[1:11:31] rahab this isn't about tamar this is
[1:11:33] about me
[1:11:35] i'm looking into the mirror of god's
[1:11:37] word and this is me
[1:11:39] and so now solomon coming into the land
[1:11:41] has to have a wife
[1:11:42] amen and he has a wife by the name of
[1:11:45] rahab
[1:11:47] and salman begot boaz of rahab
[1:11:51] hallelujah let's go back
[1:11:54] to joshua chapter 2.
[1:12:02] in the message brother beam says as i
[1:12:04] was with moses so
[1:12:05] i will be with thee from 1960. i want to
[1:12:08] draw a picture maybe it isn't right but
[1:12:10] i want
[1:12:11] to make a point by it we have no history
[1:12:14] of rahab we know that she was a
[1:12:16] prostitute
[1:12:17] let's think she was raised in a home
[1:12:19] that was a real poor
[1:12:20] and she became ill-famed so brother bran
[1:12:23] was starting to dramatize the story
[1:12:26] he said we have no history of rahab
[1:12:29] we know she was a prostitute let's think
[1:12:32] now he's starting to dramatize
[1:12:33] starting to go into her life and make a
[1:12:35] drama out of it said let's think she was
[1:12:37] raised in a home that was real poor
[1:12:39] and she became ill-famed and she's a
[1:12:42] beautiful young woman
[1:12:43] she went into the streets to make her
[1:12:45] crippled mother and father a living
[1:12:47] no way for her to work only sell the
[1:12:49] morals of her body
[1:12:51] but i can imagine all the time she knew
[1:12:53] that was wrong
[1:12:57] this is my worldly journey he's talking
[1:12:59] about it
[1:13:01] doing things reprehensible things that
[1:13:05] are shameful things that i wouldn't tell
[1:13:06] you about
[1:13:08] but all the time i knew deep down
[1:13:10] something was wrong amen
[1:13:12] it meant going to parties and trying to
[1:13:14] have fun but something was wrong
[1:13:15] something was telling me it was wrong
[1:13:19] this is rahab maybe selling the mortals
[1:13:22] over her body but i can imagine all the
[1:13:23] time she knew that was wrong
[1:13:25] there was something in her told her now
[1:13:28] that's not right to do that
[1:13:30] she knew it wasn't what was in her amen
[1:13:33] that was more than a conscience amen
[1:13:35] there was something
[1:13:36] godly in her because she was a
[1:13:38] predestinated womb
[1:13:39] she was predestinated to be in the line
[1:13:42] of christ and her womb was predestinated
[1:13:45] to receive the right seed to bring forth
[1:13:47] the right product
[1:13:49] and yours is the same way you as a
[1:13:51] little child amen sometimes things would
[1:13:53] go wrong
[1:13:54] there was a sensitivity sometimes in you
[1:13:56] that wasn't in others amen there was a
[1:13:58] desire somehow you felt a little
[1:14:01] different or a little on the outside or
[1:14:03] a little never fitting in what was that
[1:14:05] that wasn't you
[1:14:06] that was a life down on the inside of
[1:14:09] you
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:16] this bible's a mirror
[1:14:20] now there's two ways you can preach the
[1:14:22] mirror of god's word
[1:14:24] you can preach it this way so you can
[1:14:25] see where you don't measure up and make
[1:14:27] corrections
[1:14:30] yeah you can do that or you can look at
[1:14:34] it to find your proper identification
[1:14:38] who you really are when brother branham
[1:14:39] told the story
[1:14:41] of the little boy who went with his
[1:14:43] mother into the city never been there
[1:14:44] before and
[1:14:45] never seen a mirror before and he goes
[1:14:47] up the stairs and he he's confronted
[1:14:48] with another little boy and he raises
[1:14:50] his hand the boy raises his hand and
[1:14:51] raises this one and makes a funny face
[1:14:54] and finally he looks back and says mama
[1:14:56] that's me that's
[1:14:59] exactly what's happening as we go
[1:15:01] through these four women
[1:15:02] and the first six verses of matthew
[1:15:04] we're saying that's me
[1:15:06] oh that's me and that's me and that's me
[1:15:08] and that's me i can see
[1:15:10] myself in the mirror of the word it's
[1:15:13] reflecting back to me
[1:15:14] who i really am not what i've been
[1:15:17] identified by in the world
[1:15:18] not what school teachers told me or
[1:15:20] parents told me but who
[1:15:22] i really am
[1:15:26] she knew it wasn't one day she heard
[1:15:29] that there was a god that was moving
[1:15:31] her heart began to tremble why
[1:15:36] why did her heart tremble than everybody
[1:15:38] else's in jericho that trembled a
[1:15:39] different way
[1:15:40] their heart trembled out of fear of
[1:15:42] losing what they had her heart was
[1:15:44] trembling in order to gain something she
[1:15:45] didn't have
[1:15:47] they're both their hearts trembled but
[1:15:49] for two very different reasons
[1:15:51] in jericho they were trembling because
[1:15:52] they didn't want to lose their great
[1:15:54] city
[1:15:54] they didn't want to lose their great
[1:15:56] denominational system they didn't want
[1:15:57] to lose their power and the prestige
[1:15:59] but this little woman had no power no
[1:16:01] prestige no great name
[1:16:03] her heart was trembling because she had
[1:16:05] everything to gain
[1:16:07] and nothing to lose
[1:16:12] she found a messenger she found a
[1:16:15] messenger from that great move
[1:16:16] that told her what was going to take
[1:16:18] place
[1:16:19] what did you say now joshua had signs
[1:16:22] joshua had the same sign that moses had
[1:16:25] exactly
[1:16:26] rahab didn't ask to see joshua sign
[1:16:31] she just heard it a type of the church a
[1:16:34] type of the true church that's been
[1:16:36] pulled
[1:16:37] the way of prostitution i'm methodist
[1:16:39] today
[1:16:40] baptist tomorrow presbyterian the next
[1:16:41] day pulled away in prostitution
[1:16:44] but all of a sudden a little preacher
[1:16:45] enters the city and said there's a god
[1:16:47] that lives that lived yesterday and is
[1:16:49] the same today
[1:16:50] his power is just the same he does the
[1:16:52] same works that he did when he was here
[1:16:54] on earth
[1:16:55] his agents are on the road now rahab the
[1:16:57] harlot
[1:16:58] known as a harlot that's the key
[1:17:03] known as a harlan
[1:17:09] hallelujah you are known as part of the
[1:17:13] world
[1:17:15] but you're from above you were just
[1:17:18] known as part of the world
[1:17:21] rahab the heart known as a harlot she
[1:17:24] was a type
[1:17:25] of the believer today the real believer
[1:17:29] she didn't say now i hear that joshua
[1:17:31] can do signs because he's a successor of
[1:17:33] moses
[1:17:34] i'd like to see some of those signs and
[1:17:36] if i could see those signs then i'll be
[1:17:38] then i'll believe it well he didn't
[1:17:40] absolutely have to show these signs
[1:17:42] because she believed it anyhow
[1:17:46] she wasn't a thomas she believed it
[1:17:50] now moses when he had signs he went down
[1:17:52] and performed those signs
[1:17:53] but the sign isn't the thing that took
[1:17:56] them to the promised land
[1:17:58] it wasn't the sign was the vindication
[1:18:01] of the commission
[1:18:02] and rahab believed it without seeing
[1:18:05] anything
[1:18:06] the sign didn't do anything amen the
[1:18:09] sign
[1:18:10] was a vindication of the commission it
[1:18:13] was god
[1:18:13] backing up his vessel and backing up his
[1:18:16] vindicated choice
[1:18:17] but the sign didn't move anything it was
[1:18:20] the word that moved them
[1:18:22] the sign didn't bring him out of egypt
[1:18:24] the word brought him out of egypt the
[1:18:26] sign didn't the sign never healed
[1:18:28] anybody
[1:18:29] it was faith in the word that healed the
[1:18:31] people
[1:18:32] and now you have a little woman she's
[1:18:34] typing the real believer the church of
[1:18:36] the day
[1:18:36] amen one with a faith seed inside of her
[1:18:39] doesn't have to
[1:18:40] see the same thing that took place in
[1:18:42] brother branham's ministry before she'll
[1:18:44] believe
[1:18:44] she'll believe without seeing i wasn't
[1:18:47] even
[1:18:48] born i wasn't alive i have no hope amen
[1:18:51] i
[1:18:51] saw a 20th century prophet deep calls to
[1:18:54] the deep
[1:18:54] if i hadn't seen that i'd still believe
[1:18:58] it wasn't the video of the sign that
[1:19:00] caused me to believe
[1:19:01] that was just vindicating that's the
[1:19:03] sign of the messiah that was vindicating
[1:19:05] the vessel
[1:19:06] god was backing it up but it was the
[1:19:08] word that i believed in
[1:19:12] hallelujah she didn't need to see
[1:19:16] josh she didn't have to meet joshua
[1:19:19] she didn't have to leave or joshua to
[1:19:21] come to her she believed what the
[1:19:22] messenger said about it
[1:19:28] let's look at joshua chapter 2 verse 1
[1:19:32] now we know a little bit of the history
[1:19:34] of rehab
[1:19:37] in joshua the son of nun sent out of
[1:19:40] shedding two men to spy secretly saying
[1:19:42] go view the land even jericho
[1:19:46] and they went and came into a harlot's
[1:19:48] house named rahab and lodged
[1:19:50] there and it was told the king of
[1:19:52] jericho saying behold there come
[1:19:54] there came men in hither tonight of the
[1:19:56] children of israel to search out the
[1:19:58] country
[1:19:59] and the king of jericho sent unto rahab
[1:20:01] saying bring forth the men that are come
[1:20:03] to thee
[1:20:04] which are entered into thine house for
[1:20:06] they become to search out all the
[1:20:07] country
[1:20:08] and the woman took the two men and hid
[1:20:10] them and said thus
[1:20:12] there came men unto me but i wish not
[1:20:14] whence they were
[1:20:15] and it came to pass about the time of
[1:20:17] the shutting of the gate
[1:20:18] when it was dark that the men went out
[1:20:20] whether the men went i what not
[1:20:22] pursue after them quickly for you shall
[1:20:24] overtake them
[1:20:26] but she had brought them up to the roof
[1:20:28] of the house and hid them
[1:20:29] with the stalks of flax which she had
[1:20:31] laid in order upon the roof
[1:20:33] and the men pursued after them the way
[1:20:36] to jordan and to the forwards
[1:20:37] and as soon as they which pursued after
[1:20:40] them were gone out
[1:20:41] they shut the gate so now
[1:20:44] joshua tells these two spies to go spy
[1:20:47] out that i'm going to jericho
[1:20:49] and and it's amazing when they come into
[1:20:51] jericho to spy out the land
[1:20:54] you have to ask yourself what they're
[1:20:56] looking for
[1:20:59] what are they looking for because the
[1:21:01] bible doesn't tell us
[1:21:02] that they mapped out the dimensions of
[1:21:04] the walls it didn't tell us that they
[1:21:06] looked at the garrison they counted the
[1:21:08] number of soldiers
[1:21:10] the only thing the bible tells us is
[1:21:11] they went into rahab
[1:21:14] they went to her house it doesn't tell
[1:21:17] us anything else that happens in jericho
[1:21:20] except that they found what they were
[1:21:23] looking for
[1:21:25] lord said when i return shall i find
[1:21:28] faith
[1:21:29] on the earth amen they were to spy out
[1:21:32] the land
[1:21:32] they were to look out jericho what were
[1:21:34] they looking for
[1:21:36] the bible doesn't tell us anything all
[1:21:38] it tells us is what they found
[1:21:40] and what they found was a harlot woman
[1:21:43] that believed their message
[1:21:47] it depends on what you're looking for
[1:21:50] amen because it didn't matter the size
[1:21:53] of the walls
[1:21:54] it didn't matter the number of the
[1:21:55] troops it didn't matter the weapons on
[1:21:57] top of the walls
[1:21:58] it didn't matter what kind of devices
[1:22:00] they had it didn't matter how thick the
[1:22:02] gates were
[1:22:03] it didn't matter how many layers of
[1:22:04] gates it didn't matter the secret
[1:22:06] passages
[1:22:06] it didn't matter the secret codes it
[1:22:08] didn't matter the carriers
[1:22:10] it didn't matter nothing mattered amen
[1:22:12] because god was going to bring it down
[1:22:14] supernaturally without any effort of man
[1:22:16] they didn't need to know how many people
[1:22:18] how many troops how many weapons how
[1:22:20] thick the wall
[1:22:20] that was unnecessary information
[1:22:24] but all they needed to know was is there
[1:22:26] a believer in here
[1:22:30] hallelujah and they found one
[1:22:33] and the message the token from 1963
[1:22:37] says then rahab said i've heard that i
[1:22:39] don't want to perish with the
[1:22:41] unbelievers
[1:22:42] no sir no judgment had to follow it
[1:22:45] because they was right in line
[1:22:46] she knowed it so they made a way for her
[1:22:49] to escape him
[1:22:50] they must have beli they must have
[1:22:52] believed
[1:22:53] that their own big denomination jericho
[1:22:55] was able to resist the wrath of god
[1:22:58] see their own big denomination so
[1:23:01] brother ram takes
[1:23:02] jericho and types it with a big
[1:23:03] denomination amen
[1:23:05] and now they come into the land and the
[1:23:07] first obstacle they meet in taking the
[1:23:09] land
[1:23:09] taking back the word is this great big
[1:23:12] giant denomination
[1:23:13] the mother of all denominations amen and
[1:23:16] it's got to be taken down but it's only
[1:23:18] going to be taken down
[1:23:19] by the word of god
[1:23:22] my obedience to the word and they had
[1:23:24] confidence
[1:23:25] in their big old denominational walls
[1:23:27] and they had confidence in
[1:23:28] everything they had built as a system
[1:23:30] amen but the system was coming crashing
[1:23:33] down
[1:23:38] joshua chapter 2 verse 9
[1:23:43] and she said unto the men i know that
[1:23:45] the lord hath given you the land and
[1:23:47] that your terror has fallen upon us
[1:23:50] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:23:52] faint because of you
[1:23:54] how did she know that
[1:24:02] did she believe abraham's promise
[1:24:07] she said to the man i know that the lord
[1:24:09] hath given you the land
[1:24:12] the king didn't know that the preachers
[1:24:14] didn't know that
[1:24:16] nobody else knew that but the little
[1:24:19] harlot woman knew that
[1:24:22] there was something in her that could
[1:24:24] believe
[1:24:27] said i know that the lord hath given you
[1:24:31] the land and that your terror has fallen
[1:24:33] upon us and that
[1:24:34] all the inhabitants of the land faint
[1:24:36] because of you
[1:24:38] for we have heard how the lord dried up
[1:24:40] the waters of the red sea for you when
[1:24:42] you came out of egypt and
[1:24:43] what you did unto the two kings of the
[1:24:45] amorites that were on the other side
[1:24:47] jordan saihan and all
[1:24:49] whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as
[1:24:51] we heard these things our heart didn't
[1:24:53] melt
[1:24:54] neither did there remain any more
[1:24:56] courage in any man because of you
[1:24:58] for the lord your god he is god in
[1:25:00] heaven above
[1:25:01] and in earth beneath hallelujah
[1:25:05] this little woman she's stuck in some
[1:25:07] system of idolatry
[1:25:08] she's stuck in some big denominational
[1:25:10] system but in her heart
[1:25:12] she doesn't believe in the system she
[1:25:14] doesn't believe in the teaching
[1:25:16] she believes their message amen she
[1:25:18] believes what moses told him she
[1:25:19] believes what god told abraham
[1:25:21] she's believing the whole word
[1:25:27] and she's identifying amen the response
[1:25:31] of the demon powers that are on the
[1:25:34] other side of jordan
[1:25:35] they said they are all trembling because
[1:25:38] of you
[1:25:40] she started signing when you crossed the
[1:25:42] red sea and destroyed
[1:25:43] the the nations across jordan amen the
[1:25:46] terror fell upon us
[1:25:48] amen we're all trembling because of you
[1:25:50] amen all the demon forces
[1:25:52] in the land that are keeping them off
[1:25:54] the land are afraid
[1:25:56] what are they afraid of they're afraid
[1:25:58] of somebody
[1:26:00] coming into their god-given position
[1:26:02] because they know
[1:26:03] they're there on squatter rights amen
[1:26:05] they're there because of the fall in the
[1:26:07] garden
[1:26:08] but if somebody will come based off the
[1:26:10] word of god
[1:26:12] and come according to the instructions
[1:26:13] of a prophet will begin to
[1:26:15] move back into their proper god-given
[1:26:18] position
[1:26:19] amen everything before them has to fall
[1:26:22] and now the demon powers are trembling
[1:26:30] oh if they could only caught this
[1:26:32] revelation about 40 years
[1:26:34] earlier because when the spies crossed
[1:26:37] the land to spy out the land
[1:26:38] amen they used only their intellect to
[1:26:41] discern
[1:26:42] the possibilities of taking this land
[1:26:45] they made the statement in numbers 13
[1:26:48] verse 30
[1:26:48] and caleb stilled the people before
[1:26:50] moses and said let us go up
[1:26:52] at once caleb and joshua were the only
[1:26:55] ones who had faith in the word of god
[1:26:57] and they all with human eyeballs they
[1:27:00] all
[1:27:00] saw the same thing they all saw giants
[1:27:03] they also walled cities they all saw
[1:27:05] armaments they saw the same thing
[1:27:08] but they believed two different things
[1:27:10] one could only go by what they saw
[1:27:13] but another one could see into another
[1:27:16] dimension
[1:27:17] and could see what the word could
[1:27:18] produce
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:22] caleb stealed the people from moses and
[1:27:24] said let us go up at once and possess it
[1:27:26] for we are more than able to overcome it
[1:27:30] he is not looking at himself
[1:27:34] matched up against the inhabitants of
[1:27:36] the land because they're giants
[1:27:40] he's only looking at one thing the
[1:27:43] promise
[1:27:44] that was given to abraham that's been
[1:27:46] confirmed through this prophet that's
[1:27:48] brought us this far
[1:27:49] that's the only thing he had his eyes on
[1:27:51] we are more than able to overcome it
[1:27:54] he wasn't talking about his human
[1:27:56] ability
[1:27:57] he wasn't talking about his strength of
[1:28:00] his arm or the sharpness of his sword
[1:28:02] he was talking about the promise being
[1:28:04] fulfilled in him
[1:28:06] we this day are more than over
[1:28:09] overcomers
[1:28:10] we're more than able to overcome every
[1:28:12] demon power
[1:28:13] every sickness every obstacle that we
[1:28:15] face today we're more than able
[1:28:17] not because of our strength but because
[1:28:19] of the faith we have in the word that's
[1:28:22] been restored
[1:28:23] the promise there's nothing withheld
[1:28:25] from the children of god
[1:28:26] not even the change in our bodies has
[1:28:28] been withheld
[1:28:30] it's been given to us when the thunders
[1:28:32] were preached the faith for it has
[1:28:33] already been delivered amen we just got
[1:28:36] to have the courage to walk into the
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:40] promise
[1:28:42] the change in the body amen faith for
[1:28:44] the change in the body
[1:28:46] or well the word that we need to change
[1:28:48] our bodies is not something that's
[1:28:50] coming in the future
[1:28:51] it's something that has already been
[1:28:53] preached
[1:28:54] and given to the bride
[1:28:58] that's why when it come to take the land
[1:28:59] they didn't need a new promise
[1:29:02] the promise was already given to abraham
[1:29:04] they didn't need a new promise they
[1:29:05] needed faith in the promise they already
[1:29:07] had
[1:29:09] and so a prophet was sent to the land
[1:29:12] and that prophet was coming with the
[1:29:14] pillar of fire to renew their
[1:29:16] faith in an old promise not to give them
[1:29:19] a new promise
[1:29:20] and we've had a prophet come in this day
[1:29:22] to renew our faith in an old promise
[1:29:24] not to bring us a new promise but give
[1:29:27] us the courage under a pillar of fire
[1:29:29] ministry
[1:29:30] to walk back in and possess our land
[1:29:34] the inhabitants are scared to death
[1:29:39] we were more than able to overcome it
[1:29:40] but the men that went up with him
[1:29:42] said i'm still in numbers 13. we be not
[1:29:46] able to go up against the people
[1:29:48] for they are stronger than we
[1:29:51] says who
[1:29:58] brother branham tells us that the
[1:30:00] opening of the sixth seal
[1:30:02] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:30:04] under the sixth trumpet
[1:30:06] come out of the river euphrates and
[1:30:08] brother bennett said where
[1:30:09] do they go and to the armies of
[1:30:13] hitler and stalin and mussolini
[1:30:16] we got that so those demon powers have
[1:30:19] fled out
[1:30:20] of euphrates that was holding them back
[1:30:23] and have went
[1:30:24] in to physical military might
[1:30:27] and geniuses geniuses look
[1:30:30] go go look at germany scientific
[1:30:33] geniuses making weapons of warfare
[1:30:36] demon anointed armies that could sweep
[1:30:40] through europe so fast that astonished
[1:30:41] everybody
[1:30:42] what was it demon forces
[1:30:46] brother bam says where did they go after
[1:30:48] world war ii they went into the
[1:30:50] ecclesiastical
[1:30:51] system the demons didn't go back in the
[1:30:55] euphrates they went now into the church
[1:30:57] system
[1:31:00] two hundred thousand thousand
[1:31:06] how many bride do you think on the earth
[1:31:08] today
[1:31:12] a dozen a couple hundred
[1:31:15] maybe a few thousand i don't know
[1:31:20] how many demons per
[1:31:23] bride
[1:31:26] [Laughter]
[1:31:28] and brother benham said they all are
[1:31:30] trained
[1:31:32] on taking you out
[1:31:36] 200 000 000 demon forces with one goal
[1:31:38] in mind
[1:31:39] to shut down the bride and to take her
[1:31:42] out
[1:31:43] i'd be scared to do the calculations to
[1:31:45] guess how many
[1:31:46] demons are gunning for each individual
[1:31:50] member of the bride
[1:31:52] at one time but guess what
[1:31:56] we're more than able we are more than a
[1:31:59] match amen
[1:32:00] you know what's happening as you hear
[1:32:02] the word and identify yourself in the
[1:32:04] word and say that's me and i'm not going
[1:32:06] to back down
[1:32:06] i'm not afraid of cancer i'm not afraid
[1:32:08] of flu i'm not afraid of sicknesses i'm
[1:32:11] not afraid of any of these forces or
[1:32:12] powers
[1:32:13] i'm not afraid of false teaching i'm not
[1:32:14] afraid of accusations i'm not afraid of
[1:32:16] anything
[1:32:17] moving forward you know what's happening
[1:32:18] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:32:20] have
[1:32:21] terror trembling in their heart because
[1:32:23] they're
[1:32:24] only here to rule in satan's eden amen
[1:32:27] because of the lack
[1:32:29] amen of the redeemed taking their
[1:32:31] position and that's the only reason that
[1:32:33] they have any free reign at all
[1:32:35] is because the children of god have not
[1:32:37] fully realized their potential
[1:32:42] you know why that's why they want to
[1:32:45] take the message and move it back into
[1:32:47] denominationalism
[1:32:49] and take the message and pull it back
[1:32:51] into a holding pattern
[1:32:52] where we're waiting for something we're
[1:32:54] waiting for something we're waiting for
[1:32:55] something and someday something's going
[1:32:57] to happen
[1:32:57] why because these demon forces are
[1:33:00] scared to death
[1:33:01] for you to actually take footsteps of
[1:33:03] possession
[1:33:04] on the promises that are in the word but
[1:33:07] we're not afraid
[1:33:08] to move forward amen because although
[1:33:11] moses isn't here
[1:33:12] joshua is the levites are carrying the
[1:33:16] ark
[1:33:17] what ark the word that moses restored
[1:33:20] the moses that moses brought
[1:33:22] not a new word not a different word the
[1:33:24] word that came through the ministry of
[1:33:26] moses
[1:33:27] now on the shoulders of the levites is
[1:33:29] moving into the land
[1:33:33] and demons are trembling
[1:33:37] and they will stop at nothing
[1:33:42] to try to keep you from moving one step
[1:33:44] forward
[1:33:45] they will bring discouragement
[1:33:47] misunderstanding sicknesses
[1:33:49] financial crisis you name it
[1:33:52] they'll try anything to stop you from
[1:33:54] moving forward
[1:33:56] but there's caleb's in the land today
[1:34:00] there's a generation that's rose up amen
[1:34:02] after the wilderness journey
[1:34:04] that's saying we are more than able to
[1:34:07] take it
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:11] but there was some right with them
[1:34:14] caleb believing the word caleb
[1:34:16] confessing the word caleb ready to march
[1:34:18] forward
[1:34:18] there was people right with him that
[1:34:21] spied out the land beside him
[1:34:23] that went over and said it is the truth
[1:34:30] think about how close this is
[1:34:33] the 12 with caleb and joshua went over
[1:34:36] into the land
[1:34:37] and they saw the same things and they
[1:34:40] said
[1:34:40] it is true everything moses said
[1:34:44] is true it surely is a land that floweth
[1:34:48] milk and honey
[1:34:49] they brought back great cluster of
[1:34:50] grapes just to prove that it's true
[1:34:53] it's the truth but we can't do it
[1:34:58] we're going to have to wait
[1:35:06] he says we're not able
[1:35:09] to go up against the people for they are
[1:35:10] stronger than we
[1:35:13] you mean a demon is stronger than
[1:35:16] a redeemed son of god
[1:35:20] how about 10 demons how about 10 000
[1:35:23] demons
[1:35:24] how about a hundred thousand demons how
[1:35:27] about a million
[1:35:28] demons christ in me
[1:35:33] christ in me i'm more than able to
[1:35:37] overcome
[1:35:37] because he that's in me is greater than
[1:35:39] he that's in the world it doesn't matter
[1:35:41] how many you stack up
[1:35:42] how many symptoms you lay down on my
[1:35:44] sheet at the doctors it's not going to
[1:35:46] faze me
[1:35:47] because greater is he that's in me than
[1:35:49] he that's in the world
[1:35:54] it says then they brought an evil report
[1:35:56] of the land which they had searched unto
[1:35:57] the children of israel
[1:36:00] an evil report
[1:36:04] these were children of israel these were
[1:36:08] these were on the same level as caleb
[1:36:10] they were they were his brothers
[1:36:12] they marched over and witnessed that
[1:36:14] everything the prophet said is true
[1:36:17] every the promise is true it's there but
[1:36:20] they brought an
[1:36:20] evil report against the
[1:36:24] land and the evil report is
[1:36:27] they said something different than what
[1:36:29] moses said
[1:36:32] because moses says i'm taking you to
[1:36:34] possess the land
[1:36:37] and they said we can't possess the land
[1:36:40] evil report not a false report
[1:36:43] not a mistake an evil report
[1:36:50] an evil report
[1:36:54] and they said they brought an evil
[1:36:56] report of the land which they had
[1:36:57] searched unto the children of israel
[1:36:58] saying
[1:36:59] the land through which we have gone to
[1:37:01] search it is a land that eateth up the
[1:37:03] inhabitants thereof
[1:37:06] look how many people left the message
[1:37:09] look how many people tried to go that
[1:37:10] way look how many people
[1:37:15] look how they were on fire look how
[1:37:17] zealous they were look how eager
[1:37:19] and where are they at now
[1:37:22] it's a land that eateth up the
[1:37:23] inhabitants thereof and all the people
[1:37:25] that we saw in it are men of great
[1:37:27] stature
[1:37:31] you're more impressed
[1:37:34] by the squatters on the land then you
[1:37:37] are your brothers
[1:37:40] because you look around in israel there
[1:37:42] may not have been anybody with great
[1:37:44] stature
[1:37:45] they might have looked pretty pitiful i
[1:37:48] mean the weapons that they got are stuff
[1:37:50] that they're picking up along the way
[1:37:53] piecing things together i mean they
[1:37:55] don't have uniforms that match
[1:37:57] they're wearing the same clothes and
[1:37:59] shoes they came out of egypt and as they
[1:38:00] were slaves they're wearing slave
[1:38:02] clothes slave shoes
[1:38:03] because their clothes never wore out and
[1:38:04] their shoes never wore out so they're
[1:38:06] still dressed in slave clothes slave
[1:38:08] shoes
[1:38:09] picking up whatever weapons they can
[1:38:11] find along the way
[1:38:13] and they look across it trained armies
[1:38:15] and beauty and glitter amen john
[1:38:18] marveled when he looked at the false
[1:38:19] church and you marveled an admiration
[1:38:21] and wonder because it was beautiful it
[1:38:23] was perfect
[1:38:24] all the ducks were in a row everything
[1:38:26] was in order amen and you look around at
[1:38:28] the church and the day that john was
[1:38:29] there
[1:38:30] meeting in homes and hiding out and a
[1:38:32] few little people here and a few little
[1:38:34] people there
[1:38:38] here they are their greater stature than
[1:38:42] we
[1:38:44] we've heard it said some people in the
[1:38:46] denominations live a better life than
[1:38:47] you live
[1:38:50] have we heard that some of them love god
[1:38:53] more than you do and they're doing more
[1:38:54] works for him than the bride is
[1:39:00] there's some over there with greater
[1:39:01] stature than we
[1:39:07] hallelujah no sir
[1:39:10] no works program is outworking the bride
[1:39:12] the bride's not doing her own work she's
[1:39:14] not doing works that come up in her mind
[1:39:16] or make her feel good about herself or
[1:39:18] make her feel like she's a christian
[1:39:19] she's only doing what the father shows
[1:39:21] her amen
[1:39:22] only doing jesus christ could step over
[1:39:25] invalids and mothers with sick
[1:39:26] babies and go to one man who wasn't
[1:39:28] going to die in his condition had it 38
[1:39:30] years
[1:39:31] and he talked to him and he raised him
[1:39:33] up and healed him
[1:39:34] forsaking all the others that were at
[1:39:36] the pool of bethesda
[1:39:37] because yeah
[1:39:41] because he only did what the father
[1:39:44] showed him
[1:39:45] you can't outwork the bride if you're
[1:39:47] doing the works of the father
[1:39:51] you can't be more sincere than the bride
[1:39:53] because her sincerity is based on her
[1:39:55] love of god
[1:39:56] in the word amen not a love of an idea
[1:39:58] not a love of a system not a love of a
[1:40:00] fairy tale
[1:40:01] not a love of a church or something some
[1:40:03] brotherhood but it's her love for her
[1:40:05] husband the revealed word of this hour
[1:40:07] you cannot love her you can't out
[1:40:09] sincere her you cannot work her
[1:40:11] because she's doing the true works with
[1:40:13] the true love in the right place
[1:40:18] hallelujah don't look with carnal eyes
[1:40:22] around that's the problem with these
[1:40:24] spies they looked with carnality
[1:40:26] and we're measuring things carnally
[1:40:30] say they're a greater stature than we
[1:40:33] please you've never seen me
[1:40:39] but the prophet said you've never really
[1:40:40] seen me
[1:40:42] if you ever really see me you wouldn't
[1:40:45] say that
[1:40:47] all you see is me placed in a humble
[1:40:50] little vessel
[1:40:51] of dirt and minerals and product taken
[1:40:53] out of the earth that's all you see
[1:40:56] but if you ever saw me you wouldn't make
[1:40:57] a statement like that
[1:41:00] hallelujah
[1:41:03] their greater stature and there we saw
[1:41:07] the giants the sons of enoch which come
[1:41:09] which come of the giants and we were in
[1:41:11] our own sight
[1:41:15] problem we were in our own site as
[1:41:18] grasshoppers
[1:41:21] what can we do there's just a few of us
[1:41:24] what can we do
[1:41:26] one christian the weakest christian
[1:41:30] on his or her knees makes demons tremble
[1:41:35] we don't look carnally we don't look
[1:41:37] humanly amen we look
[1:41:38] spiritually we were in our
[1:41:42] own sights as grasshoppers and so were
[1:41:45] we
[1:41:46] in their sight
[1:41:49] that's where they made a fatal mistake
[1:41:53] thinking they knew what somebody else
[1:41:55] was thinking of them
[1:41:58] they were taking their own image of
[1:42:00] themselves
[1:42:01] and projecting it into the eyes of
[1:42:03] somebody else
[1:42:05] we were in our own side as grasshoppers
[1:42:07] and we were also in their sight
[1:42:09] you don't know that what did rahab said
[1:42:14] we all tremble because of you and your
[1:42:17] god
[1:42:18] we know she's rahab in jericho
[1:42:21] amen over by the jordan river we know
[1:42:25] what god did when you cross the red sea
[1:42:29] news travels fast friends we know
[1:42:32] here's a harlot woman in jericho over
[1:42:35] over by the banks of the jordan river
[1:42:37] and she said we have heard we know about
[1:42:40] the great thing that god did when you
[1:42:42] come out of egypt and you come across
[1:42:44] the red sea on dry land
[1:42:45] we know that hey and they believed it
[1:42:48] too
[1:42:51] and their hearts trembled and terror was
[1:42:54] upon them
[1:42:56] if only these spies could have seen the
[1:42:57] real condition
[1:42:59] they'd have marched in there with joy
[1:43:04] if only this bride can see the real
[1:43:06] condition
[1:43:07] of the armies of hell the real
[1:43:11] true condition of all the demon powers
[1:43:14] and satan himself
[1:43:15] why is he rage what is he howling about
[1:43:17] because the mystery is being revealed
[1:43:19] what's he so angry about why is he so
[1:43:22] hostile
[1:43:22] amen why is he so hateful and hostile
[1:43:25] and working overtime and meant to shut
[1:43:27] down the bride
[1:43:28] why because because he's afraid friends
[1:43:33] he's afraid his insecurity is showing
[1:43:39] because as he was secure and he was
[1:43:40] setting satan's eating and he had no
[1:43:42] threat
[1:43:42] nothing to worry about he'd leave you
[1:43:44] alone
[1:43:45] because what threat or humble little you
[1:43:49] you're the biggest threat he has
[1:43:52] that's why he's working overtime to shut
[1:43:54] you down
[1:43:56] let's go to joshua 2 let's skip down to
[1:43:59] verse 23
[1:44:03] so the two men returned and descended
[1:44:05] from the mountain and passed over and
[1:44:07] came to joshua the son of nun and
[1:44:09] told him all things that befell them and
[1:44:11] they said unto joshua truly the lord
[1:44:13] hath delivered
[1:44:13] unto our delivered into our hands all
[1:44:16] the land
[1:44:17] for even all of the inhabitants of the
[1:44:19] country do faint because of us
[1:44:22] so this new generation that comes up to
[1:44:24] take the land they catch a revelation
[1:44:28] that the first ones missed and the
[1:44:30] revelation is
[1:44:32] is the demons afraid of me not me afraid
[1:44:35] of the demons
[1:44:37] it's the denominations and the false
[1:44:39] teaching the false understanding that's
[1:44:40] afraid of me
[1:44:41] i'm not afraid of them they're
[1:44:45] they're faint because of us
[1:44:48] the same ragtag group that made it
[1:44:50] through the journey for 40 years
[1:44:52] the same group that picked up armament
[1:44:54] along the way the same group
[1:44:56] amen that that has passed through amen
[1:44:59] living on manna bread from heaven
[1:45:01] this same group that comes through who
[1:45:03] thought that didn't measure up to the
[1:45:05] stature of the inhabitants who thought
[1:45:07] that they were grasshoppers and they
[1:45:08] believed the same thing
[1:45:09] this same group of people now come to
[1:45:12] another revelation that brings them
[1:45:14] back to the promise of abraham and they
[1:45:16] look at them
[1:45:17] and they receive a revelation from the
[1:45:19] harlot woman that says
[1:45:21] they're afraid of you
[1:45:26] i tell you little bride you have nothing
[1:45:28] to be afraid of
[1:45:30] no power formed against you shall
[1:45:33] prosper
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:45:35] they are afraid of you the enemy is
[1:45:39] afraid of you
[1:45:41] the demon forces the false doctrine is
[1:45:43] afraid of you
[1:45:45] you're not afraid because you realize
[1:45:48] they're afraid
[1:45:51] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:45:54] trembling
[1:45:55] amen trembling why not
[1:45:58] because i'm in a baptist church not
[1:45:59] because no trembling because
[1:46:01] i'm seeing myself in the mirror of the
[1:46:03] word and i'm recognizing that footsteps
[1:46:06] are my possession and this word is my
[1:46:09] possession
[1:46:09] and i can have it all from genesis to
[1:46:12] revelation
[1:46:13] and everything in there that i need i
[1:46:15] can have it
[1:46:16] today
[1:46:17] [Applause]
[1:46:20] hallelujah i love it
[1:46:23] let's go back up to verse 12 and keep
[1:46:26] dealing with rahab here
[1:46:30] now therefore i pray you
[1:46:35] swear no i'm sorry
[1:46:39] yeah now therefore i pray you swear unto
[1:46:41] me by the lord
[1:46:42] since i have showed you kindness that
[1:46:44] you will also show kindness into my
[1:46:46] father's house and give me a true token
[1:46:49] now she's looking for a true token
[1:46:52] one that's going to withstand in the day
[1:46:54] of judgment
[1:46:57] not a little token that makes me feel
[1:46:59] better
[1:47:00] not a little shaking not a little crying
[1:47:03] not a little speaking in tongues
[1:47:05] but i want a true token that's going to
[1:47:08] keep through the day of judgment not
[1:47:11] emotion
[1:47:11] not a sensation amen and no doubt when
[1:47:14] she got a true token she had emotion and
[1:47:16] she had sensation she was thrilled
[1:47:18] she was excited and then she was
[1:47:19] probably quite exuberant when she
[1:47:21] realized the true token
[1:47:22] amen there's nothing wrong with that but
[1:47:24] the exuberation is not the token
[1:47:28] the excitement enthusiasm is not the
[1:47:30] token
[1:47:32] she's looking for a true token
[1:47:36] verse 13 and that we will save alive and
[1:47:40] that ye will save a life my father and
[1:47:42] my mother and my brethren and my sisters
[1:47:44] and all the
[1:47:45] that they have and deliver our lives
[1:47:47] from death and the men
[1:47:48] answered her our life for yours if you
[1:47:50] utter not this our business
[1:47:52] and it shall be when the lord hath given
[1:47:54] us the land that we will deal kindly and
[1:47:56] truly with thee
[1:47:58] then she let thee down by a cord then
[1:48:00] she let them down by a cord
[1:48:02] through the window for her house was
[1:48:05] upon the town wall and she dwelt upon
[1:48:07] the wall
[1:48:08] and she said unto them get you to the
[1:48:10] mountain let the pursuers meet you
[1:48:12] and hide yourselves there three days
[1:48:15] until the pursuers be returned
[1:48:17] afterward may you go your way and the
[1:48:20] men said unto her
[1:48:21] we will be blameless of of this thine
[1:48:24] oath
[1:48:24] which thou has made us swear behold when
[1:48:27] we come into the land
[1:48:28] thou shalt bind this line of scarlet
[1:48:30] thread in the window which thou didst
[1:48:32] led us down by
[1:48:34] and thou shall bring thy father and thy
[1:48:36] mother and thy brethren and all their
[1:48:37] father's household
[1:48:39] home unto thee and it shall be them
[1:48:42] whosoever shall go out of the doors
[1:48:44] of thy house unto the street his blood
[1:48:46] shall be upon
[1:48:47] his head and we will be guiltless and
[1:48:49] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[1:48:51] house
[1:48:52] his blood shall be on our head if any
[1:48:54] hand be upon him
[1:48:56] and if thou utter this our business then
[1:48:58] we will be quit
[1:48:59] quit of thine oath which thou has made
[1:49:02] us to swear
[1:49:03] and she said according unto your word so
[1:49:05] be it and she sent them away
[1:49:06] and they departed and she bound the
[1:49:09] scarlet line
[1:49:10] in the window hallelujah
[1:49:15] so now she wants a true token
[1:49:19] she's heard the message she believes the
[1:49:22] message
[1:49:23] now she wants a true token and she
[1:49:26] receives a true token the scarlet thread
[1:49:28] and she's told he said when we come into
[1:49:30] the land bind this in thy window and
[1:49:32] you'll be saved all that are in your
[1:49:33] house shall be saved
[1:49:34] outside of this token
[1:49:38] their blood is upon their own head
[1:49:41] that's why the foolish virgin have to
[1:49:42] give their own blood for purification
[1:49:44] because they're outside the place of the
[1:49:46] token
[1:49:50] he said now in this token this score if
[1:49:52] it's here
[1:49:53] if it's here we come into the land all
[1:49:55] that are here will be safe
[1:49:57] and they left and she immediately
[1:50:00] bounded in the window
[1:50:02] now her token is on display
[1:50:07] not in the bedroom not in the bathroom
[1:50:08] not in the kitchen not in your prayer
[1:50:10] closet
[1:50:13] but now the scarlet thread amen her
[1:50:16] token of her redemption and salvation
[1:50:18] now must be on the window
[1:50:20] where everybody outside can see it
[1:50:24] that's why in this hour our token is the
[1:50:26] literal life of jesus christ
[1:50:28] and it's not in our prayer closet amen
[1:50:30] it's not just at home and it's not only
[1:50:32] a church
[1:50:33] but it must be bound in the window of
[1:50:35] our house of our life
[1:50:36] so everybody can see the token is on
[1:50:39] display
[1:50:47] 1960 the message as i was with moses so
[1:50:49] i'll be with thee
[1:50:50] brother brown says this great harlot
[1:50:52] rehab became a believer
[1:50:54] i took her history here not long ago
[1:50:56] after she was considered and brought
[1:50:57] into the faith because of her belief in
[1:50:59] god
[1:50:59] she was brought into israel faith a
[1:51:01] proselyte she courted a general in the
[1:51:03] army of the israelite
[1:51:05] army watch what god did for that woman
[1:51:08] they moved up in the bethlehem and they
[1:51:09] had a son
[1:51:11] and this son they called him boaz and
[1:51:12] out of boaz he married ruth and ruth
[1:51:15] and boaz came jesse out of jesse david
[1:51:17] out of david came jesus
[1:51:18] hallelujah why faith cometh by hearing
[1:51:21] hearing of the word of hearing of god
[1:51:24] that's god of heaven and earth
[1:51:26] and believing on him believing what
[1:51:29] this is what gets really important
[1:51:31] believing what
[1:51:33] because she says we all know speaking of
[1:51:36] all those in that big denomination
[1:51:38] we all know what god did at the red sea
[1:51:40] we all know what god did across jordan
[1:51:42] destroying his army
[1:51:43] we all know that and we all tremble so
[1:51:45] it wasn't believing the parting of the
[1:51:47] red sea
[1:51:48] it wasn't the believing of destroying of
[1:51:50] ogg and beijon
[1:51:51] that's not it's the works you can
[1:51:53] believe all of the works that's not a
[1:51:54] problem
[1:51:55] amen but she believes something
[1:51:57] different something more not different
[1:51:59] something more
[1:52:00] than just the miracles and just the
[1:52:01] signs and just the wonders
[1:52:03] she believed something more than what
[1:52:05] everybody else in jericho believed
[1:52:11] believing what the commission that god
[1:52:14] had given to a man named joshua
[1:52:17] believing that commission amen
[1:52:20] she believed the joshua commission
[1:52:23] she believed the commission the man got
[1:52:25] everybody in jericho
[1:52:27] believed in the red sea crossing the
[1:52:29] deliverance out of egypt the killing of
[1:52:31] pharaoh's armies the destruction of
[1:52:33] oghan beijing
[1:52:36] they all believed that
[1:52:39] but they didn't believe the commission
[1:52:42] and the difference was believing the
[1:52:44] revealed word for your day
[1:52:48] not just the miracles and signs and
[1:52:49] wonders in the ministry of a prophet
[1:52:51] they didn't that wasn't it it was
[1:52:53] believing joshua's commission
[1:52:56] and what was his commission his
[1:52:57] commission was go
[1:52:59] in and possess the land that belongs to
[1:53:02] you
[1:53:03] because of a promise that i gave to
[1:53:05] abraham
[1:53:07] that was the revealed word for that day
[1:53:09] and the rest of them believed the
[1:53:10] miracles but didn't believe that
[1:53:12] because they believed they had a right
[1:53:14] to the land and would not
[1:53:16] accept the commission
[1:53:19] but here comes a little woman that
[1:53:21] believes the miracles signs and wonders
[1:53:23] but also believes the commission
[1:53:25] that this land is given to your hand
[1:53:28] god gave it to you because of abraham
[1:53:30] your abraham seed
[1:53:32] and she's believing the revealed word
[1:53:34] for her
[1:53:35] hour which gave her
[1:53:40] access to a true token and that true
[1:53:43] token gave her family access to
[1:53:46] salvation
[1:53:47] by believing more than the signs and the
[1:53:50] miracles by believing
[1:53:51] more than the story of the prophet by
[1:53:53] believing more
[1:53:54] she was now believing the commission the
[1:53:57] very
[1:53:58] reason for the exodus the very reason
[1:54:01] for them to come across jordan
[1:54:03] she believed the word for her day
[1:54:08] we gave her access to the token
[1:54:11] the message perseverance remember she
[1:54:13] was like the rahab the harlot
[1:54:15] when the spies went over to spy out the
[1:54:17] land and rahab saw them
[1:54:18] that was her first opportunity she had
[1:54:22] it was her first opportunity
[1:54:25] she said see she said say bring joshua
[1:54:28] over here and let me see him let me size
[1:54:29] him up
[1:54:30] he's a great big handsome fellow does he
[1:54:32] have curly hair
[1:54:33] well you know i might believe him to be
[1:54:34] the leader of god's band
[1:54:36] she didn't want to see joshua she didn't
[1:54:39] want to see any of his or his miracles
[1:54:41] she said i heard that god's with you and
[1:54:44] i want to go with you too
[1:54:46] amen she was persistent i don't care
[1:54:48] what the rest of my people do
[1:54:50] how where they're dug in how much
[1:54:51] they're fortified god's given you this
[1:54:53] place and i
[1:54:54] want to go with you
[1:54:58] believing something different then
[1:55:02] it's believing something different than
[1:55:05] great miracles in prayer lines
[1:55:09] but believing that god has given his
[1:55:11] mystery truth
[1:55:12] the revelation of the seventeenth and
[1:55:14] he's given that land to the bride
[1:55:16] and the bride now is possessing that
[1:55:18] land the full word and i believe that
[1:55:20] and i want to go with you too
[1:55:23] that's the revealed word for our day
[1:55:24] friends
[1:55:26] a lot of people believe in prophetic
[1:55:28] ministry a lot of people believe
[1:55:30] amen that there was a great exodus and a
[1:55:33] great destroying of pharaoh's army and a
[1:55:35] crossing on dry land a lot of people
[1:55:37] believe in the destruction of two armies
[1:55:38] a lot of people believe that but there's
[1:55:41] more than that
[1:55:42] there's a bride that's coming in to
[1:55:43] possess her inheritance amen and it's
[1:55:46] given to her
[1:55:46] and it's falling under her feet day by
[1:55:49] day by revelation by revelation
[1:55:51] she's taking her position
[1:55:54] and this rahab said that's the truth and
[1:55:58] i want to be part of it
[1:56:00] hallelujah
[1:56:06] hallelujah
[1:56:10] brother brother goes on to say i was
[1:56:13] with moses so i'll be with thee
[1:56:15] now she didn't have to see a sign that
[1:56:17] joshua could do with his hand or with a
[1:56:19] stick
[1:56:19] she believed believers don't have to see
[1:56:22] anything
[1:56:23] they're believers and seeing won't make
[1:56:26] them believers
[1:56:28] and not seeing won't make them
[1:56:30] unbelievers they're believers
[1:56:34] he said i heard and i believe and now
[1:56:35] i'm asking for mercy oh
[1:56:37] how we could put a lesson right there
[1:56:39] i'm asking for mercy for me and my house
[1:56:41] look at the roman that night that pulled
[1:56:43] his sword and was going to kill himself
[1:56:44] the philippine

[1:56:48] yourself no harm we're all here

[1:57:36] to die in the arms of jehovah i believe
[1:57:38] you're god because he's the god
[1:57:39] of heaven and earth he does visible
[1:57:41] things he makes things real
[1:57:43] i've never seen him do it but i believe
[1:57:45] it anyhow
[1:57:49] she never seen joshua she just heard of
[1:57:51] joshua she'd never seen god
[1:57:53] she'd never seen any of the works of god
[1:57:55] she just heard
[1:57:56] others had seen it and she believed by
[1:57:58] hearing it now i said i want favor for
[1:58:00] me and my father my mother
[1:58:02] they're both old crippled up i've got
[1:58:04] some brethren i want to have faith for

[1:58:42] where that where that little red cord
[1:58:45] was to hang down the window will be
[1:58:46] responsible if you put them

[1:59:05] them and i've told them quit telling
[1:59:06] them and start praying with faith
[1:59:08] believing
[1:59:09] that god's going to move them in if you
[1:59:11] believe that they're your heritage and
[1:59:12] you believe with all your heart they're
[1:59:13] given to you
[1:59:14] start saying god move mountains move
[1:59:16] obstacles bring them
[1:59:18] into the household of faith

[1:59:23] outside of the household
[1:59:25] where the token is on display outside of
[1:59:27] that
[1:59:28] there is utter destruction going to take
[1:59:30] place
[1:59:36] brother rem says in the token 1964 he

[1:59:41] covenant
[1:59:42] the blood life catch this
[1:59:47] not the blood the blood life

[2:00:21] that gave
[2:00:21] that gave him life when the blood cell
[2:00:23] was broke that life was able to release
[2:00:26] and come back on the believer again amen
[2:00:28] and it's not the chemistry of the blood
[2:00:30] brother ben said that went down into the
[2:00:32] ground into the soil in judea
[2:00:34] amen but it's the blood life amen
[2:00:38] that life of the blood coming into the
[2:00:41] believer

[2:01:03] the token
[2:01:05] the new token is the new life that comes
[2:01:07] through jesus christ
[2:01:08] when his blood was shed to sanctify a
[2:01:11] church
[2:01:12] and fill it with his presence that he
[2:01:14] might manifest
[2:01:15] his word and his promise to the people
[2:01:20] i want to go back here and i want to
[2:01:21] look at verse 15 again
[2:01:23] chapter 2 verse 15. my my my my my
[2:01:29] praise god we've been so far so far yet
[2:01:32] to go
[2:01:33] but let's just read here in verse 15.
[2:01:40] then she let them down by a cord through
[2:01:42] the window
[2:01:43] for her house was upon the town wall and
[2:01:46] she dwelt upon the wall
[2:01:48] and she said unto them get you to the
[2:01:50] mountain lest the pursuers meet you and
[2:01:51] hide yourselves there three days until
[2:01:53] the pursuers be returned
[2:01:55] and afterward may you go your way and
[2:01:58] the men said unto her we will be
[2:01:59] blameless of this thine oath which thou
[2:02:01] has made us swear
[2:02:03] behold when we come into the land that
[2:02:05] thou shalt bind this line of the scarlet
[2:02:08] thread
[2:02:09] this line of scarlet thread in the
[2:02:10] window which thou dost led us down by
[2:02:13] and thou shalt bring thy father my
[2:02:15] mother my brethren
[2:02:16] and all thy father's house down into
[2:02:18] thee so i want to read two portions
[2:02:20] again
[2:02:23] she let them down by accord through the
[2:02:24] window
[2:02:27] down verse 18. when we come into the
[2:02:30] land thou shalt bind this line of
[2:02:31] scarlet thread in the window which thou
[2:02:33] just led us down by
[2:02:36] brother bennett said in the token
[2:02:39] november
[2:02:40] 28 1963 notice there was given to her a
[2:02:44] token
[2:02:45] a red token that scarlet string that she
[2:02:48] let the people
[2:02:50] the spies down out of the window was to
[2:02:53] be a token
[2:02:56] here's a great mystery
[2:02:59] the token she had that she was given
[2:03:03] was a token she already had
[2:03:09] the token she was given was a token she
[2:03:11] already had
[2:03:14] but the river said that scarlet string
[2:03:16] that she let the people the spies
[2:03:18] down out of the window was to be a token
[2:03:24] god would not god would not destroying
[2:03:27] it
[2:03:27] god's destroying angel would not come
[2:03:29] near her as long as she had the token
[2:03:31] but what if she said oh let them down oh
[2:03:34] i let them down
[2:03:36] done a good deed so now to keep anybody
[2:03:38] from criticizing me and seeing this
[2:03:39] scarlet rope hanging out here
[2:03:41] i'll pull the rope back up then the
[2:03:43] judgment angel would have never passed
[2:03:45] over her house she had to have the token
[2:03:47] displayed
[2:03:48] and it remained there
[2:03:51] there was something in rahab's house
[2:03:55] that she had something she may not have
[2:03:59] been able to explain
[2:04:01] something that maybe had laid in the
[2:04:03] corner for years something maybe she had
[2:04:05] carried from childhood
[2:04:06] something that she had in her house that
[2:04:09] she couldn't explain
[2:04:10] and it was this rope this cord
[2:04:14] why do you have a cord i don't know why
[2:04:16] i have a cord there's a cord in my house
[2:04:18] i don't know why it's here but there's
[2:04:20] something that she's had with her
[2:04:21] and then when the spies come along now
[2:04:24] amen when it's time to believe the word
[2:04:27] now to believe the word i'm going to
[2:04:28] take this chord in my believing the word
[2:04:30] and doing a service to the word
[2:04:32] i'm going to put this chord into action
[2:04:36] and i'm going to throw this cord out the
[2:04:38] window and let down
[2:04:40] the spies and the spies will say if you
[2:04:43] amen tie this scarlet cord this line
[2:04:46] of the window that that loud let us down
[2:04:49] by when we come into the land your house
[2:04:51] will be spared
[2:04:53] i want you to listen to a couple quotes
[2:04:54] brother branham brings
[2:04:57] and how can i overcome
[2:05:00] it's just like a lily a lily i think is
[2:05:03] one of the most prettiest flowers that
[2:05:04] there is
[2:05:05] i'm very fond of these great calla
[2:05:07] lilies and pond lily
[2:05:08] i think there's nothing hardly as pretty
[2:05:10] as great big pond lily call it water
[2:05:11] lily
[2:05:12] how it's radiance now where does it come
[2:05:14] from
[2:05:15] it's a little seed down in the bottom of
[2:05:17] a muddy
[2:05:18] mucky pond
[2:05:21] now you're going to start finding out
[2:05:22] where this cord come from
[2:05:25] and that little seed yet all the
[2:05:27] radiance that'll ever shine in and
[2:05:29] is in it right then when it's in the mud
[2:05:33] but it has to strive daily knowing that
[2:05:35] there is something
[2:05:36] it's black it's dirty it's mucky it's
[2:05:38] slimy
[2:05:39] in that slime that it's living in yet
[2:05:41] it's pressing its way through the mud
[2:05:43] the muck and the waters and the
[2:05:45] stagnant places until it sticks its head
[2:05:47] above
[2:05:48] in the light and expresses what's been
[2:05:50] hid in it
[2:05:51] all the time
[2:05:56] i think that's an overcomer that once in
[2:05:59] sin
[2:06:00] once did things that was wrong don't
[2:06:02] worry about it now
[2:06:04] hallelujah is the devil trying to make
[2:06:07] you worry about it
[2:06:07] don't worry about it now did things that
[2:06:11] was wrong don't worry about it now
[2:06:12] once did things that was wrong then now
[2:06:14] why look back into the pond again see
[2:06:17] god by his predestination sea has
[2:06:19] brought this seed to life
[2:06:21] and it's pressing itself see coming to
[2:06:23] light and now on top of
[2:06:24] all of that it has overcome it doesn't
[2:06:27] express itself down there
[2:06:28] it's getting up to express itself
[2:06:31] neither do you
[2:06:32] and your sin and adultery and everything
[2:06:34] that you lived in you didn't express
[2:06:36] nothing
[2:06:36] but there was a seed in there and i got
[2:06:40] it
[2:06:40] and it got a chance to press into the
[2:06:43] light
[2:06:44] and now you're in the presence of jesus
[2:06:45] christ the sunlight it brought out what
[2:06:47] you really was
[2:06:49] in the beginning you see what i mean
[2:06:52] you saw the light you bloomed out you
[2:06:54] laid your heart open and now
[2:06:56] you're a lily you always was a lily
[2:07:00] but it couldn't nobody could tell you
[2:07:02] didn't look like nothing amen but until
[2:07:04] you pushed your way up through slime and
[2:07:06] muck and black water in stagnant stinky
[2:07:09] places
[2:07:10] and you come into the light and begin to
[2:07:12] express what you
[2:07:13] always were in the beginning
[2:07:17] he says and who is this melchizedek and
[2:07:19] when you become subject to that spirit
[2:07:21] he's speaking of the holy spirit when
[2:07:22] you become subject to that spirit it
[2:07:24] throws your whole being subject to the
[2:07:26] spirit
[2:07:28] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[2:07:32] but this seed word made manifest or
[2:07:35] quickened
[2:07:36] hallelujah what is that spirit
[2:07:40] what is that new birth it's that seed
[2:07:43] that was
[2:07:44] always there from before the foundation
[2:07:46] of the world
[2:07:47] amen when it comes into the light amen
[2:07:49] it strikes it
[2:07:50] and it comes to life amen and what is
[2:07:52] that spirit is nothing in the word more
[2:07:55] than the seed word
[2:07:56] being made manifest quicken to life
[2:08:02] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:08:04] how do you know because you're a church
[2:08:06] member

[2:08:32] no word can get no world can get in oh
[2:08:35] how we'd like to stay on this for about
[2:08:36] an hour i'm sure you understand
[2:08:38] christ and his alone already finished
[2:08:42] the seed was there the seed was all
[2:08:44] ready when was it put there
[2:08:46] before the foundation of the world has
[2:08:49] predestinated us into eternal life
[2:08:52] and as soon as this life-giving flow
[2:08:53] that seed laying there
[2:08:56] other seeds that just would come in
[2:08:58] wouldn't take hold
[2:09:00] rahab was a harlot other seeds come in
[2:09:04] just wouldn't take hold
[2:09:05] seed after seed after seed after seed
[2:09:07] from all kinds of sources
[2:09:09] it wouldn't take hold amen this source
[2:09:11] and that so it wouldn't take hold
[2:09:12] amen until she come into the line of
[2:09:15] judah till the prince of the tribe of
[2:09:17] judah
[2:09:17] had entered into the promised land she
[2:09:19] was predestinated to be a womb that
[2:09:22] would receive
[2:09:22] only one seed
[2:09:26] it didn't matter how many kinds had to
[2:09:27] wash over there was something laying
[2:09:29] down inside of her
[2:09:31] amen and that thing that was laying down
[2:09:33] outside of her would only be receptive
[2:09:35] to
[2:09:36] one seed it didn't matter
[2:09:39] baptist seed catholic seed presbyterian
[2:09:42] seed
[2:09:42] holiness seed amen none of that seed was
[2:09:45] going to
[2:09:46] bring forth life rahab was a harlot
[2:09:48] where are her children
[2:09:51] when she prays she prays for her
[2:09:53] father's house and her father and her
[2:09:54] mother and her brethren and all that
[2:09:55] they have
[2:09:56] she doesn't ask anything for any of her
[2:09:58] children because she's a predestinated
[2:10:00] womb
[2:10:01] that will only conceive in the line
[2:10:04] of judah
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:07] amen because there's a bride on the
[2:10:09] earth no matter what she's believed
[2:10:11] no matter where she's been no matter how
[2:10:13] much she's corrupted her mind
[2:10:15] amen no matter how many seeds washed in
[2:10:17] they wouldn't take hold
[2:10:18] because she's predestinated to receive
[2:10:20] one seed
[2:10:21] and that's the seed word that comes
[2:10:23] through the lion
[2:10:24] of the tribe of judah and when she comes
[2:10:28] in contact
[2:10:29] with the lion of the tribe of judah now
[2:10:32] there's a conception
[2:10:34] and in that conception what does she
[2:10:36] bring forth
[2:10:38] boaz the kinsman redeemer
[2:10:42] she the harlot amen the harlot of
[2:10:45] jericho
[2:10:46] she brings forth the kinsmen redeemer
[2:10:50] the type of christ laying in the book of
[2:10:52] ruth that brother branham will go back
[2:10:54] and show us what's happening in the
[2:10:56] seals
[2:10:57] happened here because rahab the harlot
[2:11:00] when they come into the land
[2:11:01] come to the kid the prince of judah and
[2:11:04] together
[2:11:05] that was the predestinated seed in the
[2:11:07] predestinated womb
[2:11:08] to bring forth the redeemer
[2:11:11] [Applause]
[2:11:12] do you see yourself
[2:11:16] adam was given a bride to reproduce
[2:11:18] himself
[2:11:20] christ is given a bride to do the same
[2:11:24] we've been playing a harlot assumed to
[2:11:27] be a harlot
[2:11:28] labeled as a harlot with the world
[2:11:31] but none of the world's seeds could take
[2:11:33] hold because we had a predestinated
[2:11:35] wound that was only receptive to the
[2:11:37] prince
[2:11:38] of the house of david only recepted to
[2:11:41] the
[2:11:41] king to the king of the king tribe
[2:11:46] and when that came in it produced the
[2:11:49] kinsmen redeemer
[2:11:52] hallelujah
[2:11:56] when was it put there before the
[2:11:57] foundation of the world
[2:12:02] has predest before the foundation was
[2:12:04] redesignate us into eternal
[2:12:06] life and as soon as the life-giving flow
[2:12:08] that seed laying there
[2:12:09] other seeds that just would come in
[2:12:10] wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it
[2:12:13] but when that seed come in quickly it
[2:12:15] stopped up the womb
[2:12:16] all the rest of the seed was drove out
[2:12:18] see like that
[2:12:21] now now
[2:12:25] what is rahab is she a harlot now
[2:12:32] now she's a princess because now she's
[2:12:36] married
[2:12:36] to a prince in judah
[2:12:40] she's went from harlot to princess
[2:12:45] and one of the mothers in the line of
[2:12:47] christ
[2:12:50] i want to read just a couple more quotes
[2:12:52] and then we'll wrap up
[2:13:00] brother i'm saying jesus christ the same
[2:13:02] yesterday today and forever
[2:13:03] if there is nothing in the heart to
[2:13:05] receive it then there is nothing there
[2:13:08] how can you get blood from a turnip
[2:13:10] there is there ain't no blood in it
[2:13:11] so how can a man believe when there is
[2:13:14] nothing in there to believe with
[2:13:18] how could rahab believe unless there was
[2:13:19] something in there to believe with
[2:13:24] the voice of the sign 1964
[2:13:28] this is always god's way of making his
[2:13:30] voice known to his people he sends his
[2:13:32] prophet and gives a sign
[2:13:34] and then takes his voice that's been
[2:13:36] spoken before on his word
[2:13:38] and vindicates it by this man and they
[2:13:40] know that it's his voice because it's
[2:13:42] the promised word of the day oh if
[2:13:44] people could only see that
[2:13:46] if they could only stop just a moment
[2:13:48] and realize that you see there is no way
[2:13:50] to make them believe it there is
[2:13:51] there is no way a man god himself can't
[2:13:54] do it
[2:13:55] make the people believe it
[2:13:58] you've got to believe it and if there's
[2:14:00] nothing there to believe with
[2:14:03] how can they believe
[2:14:07] no matter what you do
[2:14:11] there was something in rahab that was
[2:14:13] always in rahab
[2:14:15] living the life of heartland knowing it
[2:14:16] was wrong
[2:14:18] she was stuck into this life there was
[2:14:20] something always in here
[2:14:22] and when she would begin to hear the
[2:14:23] testimonies that were coming through
[2:14:25] of the red sea crossing and destroyed
[2:14:27] something in here would begin to stir
[2:14:29] but then brother bam said the preachers
[2:14:31] got in one day began to tell her the
[2:14:33] message of joshua
[2:14:35] and and she believed it and she
[2:14:37] recognized this true
[2:14:39] and she says i want to be part of this i
[2:14:41] want to live
[2:14:42] i don't want to die i believe
[2:14:46] and they go she goes to do a service her
[2:14:49] faith
[2:14:50] gets her an action what she believes
[2:14:52] produces her condy
[2:14:53] and she takes that cord that's in her
[2:14:55] house and then she throws it out the
[2:14:57] window and she lets the spies out the
[2:14:59] window
[2:15:01] and she's saying my house my family my
[2:15:04] salvation
[2:15:05] and they said the cord
[2:15:09] that you let us out the window by tie
[2:15:12] that in the window and when we come
[2:15:14] what did she ask for a true token
[2:15:19] what's what came to quicken that seed
[2:15:21] inside of you and what was that seed
[2:15:24] that seed was the life of god amen
[2:15:27] laying dormant or inactive inside of you
[2:15:31] i say dormant inactive but it can't be
[2:15:32] dormant and active it's the thing that's
[2:15:34] moved your whole life you just weren't
[2:15:36] aware of it
[2:15:38] it's the life of god it's the very life
[2:15:41] of god attributes of god down on the
[2:15:42] inside
[2:15:43] what's going to quicken it to life the
[2:15:45] life of god the spirit
[2:15:47] so when the word comes to the word
[2:15:50] when life comes to life when seed comes
[2:15:53] to seed
[2:15:55] it springs the life and goes into action
[2:15:57] there is something that rey have always
[2:15:59] had but she didn't know what it was
[2:16:01] she didn't know what to do with it she
[2:16:02] didn't know how to find a true token but
[2:16:04] that true token was when that life on
[2:16:06] the inside of her
[2:16:08] when she would recognize the word for
[2:16:09] her day she would recognize the
[2:16:11] commission amen and she would she would
[2:16:13] she would call out for it
[2:16:14] amen that thing would spring the life
[2:16:16] and they they identified
[2:16:17] that's a true token when the life
[2:16:21] comes to quicken that life when the
[2:16:24] spirit of god
[2:16:25] comes to quicken the life that's laying
[2:16:27] inside the soul
[2:16:30] that's the new birth that's
[2:16:33] the blood life coming into action
[2:16:36] and that's a true token
[2:16:41] why is it you could believe
[2:16:44] and others couldn't how is it that you
[2:16:48] can list
[2:16:49] all of your inabilities
[2:16:52] and you can list all of the reasons why
[2:16:55] you shouldn't be a seed of god
[2:16:59] amen some of you can make a pretty good
[2:17:01] list i can make a really nice list
[2:17:04] i could list you all the justifications
[2:17:06] and the reasons why that i
[2:17:08] should not be a seed of god
[2:17:12] because i did this and i did that and i
[2:17:14] did that hey
[2:17:15] you'd have a hard time beating rahab
[2:17:19] i bet her list is longer than yours
[2:17:24] but there was something there all the
[2:17:26] time
[2:17:28] doesn't matter how many reasons you can
[2:17:30] say i was in the wrong place at the
[2:17:31] wrong time doing the wrong thing so was
[2:17:33] rahab
[2:17:35] but little did she know she was in the
[2:17:37] right place
[2:17:39] at the right time doing the right things
[2:17:43] because she had to be carried over into
[2:17:45] the new testament in place in matthew
[2:17:47] chapter one
[2:17:49] in her perfect position in a perfect
[2:17:52] place
[2:17:52] for the perfect time to express
[2:17:54] something that only
[2:17:56] she can express and now you and i are
[2:18:00] here
[2:18:00] and we've all traveled through all kinds
[2:18:02] of muck and mud and
[2:18:04] slime and dark waters and stagnant
[2:18:07] things we've come through all kinds of
[2:18:08] stuff
[2:18:09] why because we were the right person in
[2:18:12] the right place
[2:18:14] doing the right things to express this
[2:18:16] great love story in our day
[2:18:20] i thank god i thank god
[2:18:23] for his word let's all stand musicians
[2:18:27] if you'd like to come
[2:18:35] praise the lord amazing
[2:18:39] in the day that the spies came into
[2:18:43] jericho
[2:18:46] there was a little harlot woman and
[2:18:50] only one little woman
[2:18:53] that was given the secret to escape the
[2:18:55] coming judgment
[2:18:59] judgment was coming it couldn't be
[2:19:01] stopped
[2:19:02] it was ordained it was prophesied it was
[2:19:04] coming nobody could stop it
[2:19:06] but there was one little woman of ill
[2:19:09] fame
[2:19:10] of a bad reputation one and
[2:19:13] she was given the mystery secret
[2:19:16] of salvation for that day
[2:19:20] to be saved from the impending
[2:19:21] destruction
[2:19:24] and the only way that you could be saved
[2:19:28] in that day
[2:19:30] from the judgment that was coming to
[2:19:31] jericho was to believe her
[2:19:34] and go into that house where the token
[2:19:37] was
[2:19:39] that's it you could pray you could offer
[2:19:41] sacrifices
[2:19:42] you could run out the gates and throw
[2:19:44] yourself down before joshua but there
[2:19:46] was only one way
[2:19:47] that anybody in jericho was going to be
[2:19:50] saved
[2:19:51] from the coming destruction and the only
[2:19:54] way
[2:19:55] was to believe this woman and come under
[2:19:58] the true token that she was displaying
[2:20:03] hallelujah god has taken us
[2:20:08] from rubbish from
[2:20:12] wasted product of life
[2:20:15] and he's made us a princess in the house
[2:20:17] of judah
[2:20:19] he's taken us from nobody
[2:20:23] from the scum of the earth from
[2:20:26] obscurity
[2:20:28] and he's placed inside of us
[2:20:32] he's placed inside of us a true token
[2:20:35] and now that true token is displayed in
[2:20:37] the window
[2:20:39] as seeds come to life the life of christ
[2:20:41] on display
[2:20:43] and now this woman holds the secret
[2:20:46] to being saved from the destruction
[2:20:48] that's coming
[2:20:51] you don't realize instantly
[2:20:54] this woman became the most important
[2:20:56] person in jericho
[2:20:59] in a moment's time she came from being
[2:21:03] desired for one reason
[2:21:05] the wrong reason to now she became
[2:21:09] extremely desirable
[2:21:12] for the right reason
[2:21:16] don't sell yourself short don't believe
[2:21:20] the evil report
[2:21:23] don't believe that you're small in
[2:21:24] stature and their stature is greater
[2:21:26] don't believe that they're stronger
[2:21:28] that's an evil report
[2:21:29] amen but those demons that fight you
[2:21:32] those spirits that come against you
[2:21:34] every day they're afraid of you
[2:21:38] they call you all kinds of names because
[2:21:41] of the way you used to live and the
[2:21:42] things you've done
[2:21:43] they label you harlot and they label you
[2:21:45] this and they label you all of that
[2:21:48] but none of those labels fit anymore
[2:21:51] i doubt solomon when he come to his wife
[2:21:54] after the wedding
[2:21:55] amen and little boaz is born he's
[2:21:57] bouncing bowls of his knee
[2:21:58] he's not saying hey harlot come here and
[2:22:01] hey harlot come here
[2:22:02] and i doubt solomon will let anybody
[2:22:04] else in the camp of israel refer her
[2:22:06] refer to her as the harlot from jericho
[2:22:09] because she through marriage has changed
[2:22:11] her identity
[2:22:13] and she is no longer the harlot of
[2:22:15] jericho she's a
[2:22:16] princess the wife of solomon amen the
[2:22:19] chief
[2:22:19] in the house of judah and she's his wife
[2:22:22] making her tops not bottoms
[2:22:28] and making her critical
[2:22:32] to redemption because without her
[2:22:36] there's no boaz and boaz is the kinsman
[2:22:39] redeemer
[2:22:42] you're not just people with jobs who
[2:22:45] come to church
[2:22:46] in lima on sunday that is not your
[2:22:49] identification
[2:22:51] you're not just this kind of worker in
[2:22:53] that kind of work and not just a mom or
[2:22:55] just a dad you're not just a family

[2:25:36] daughters of god
[2:25:37] instrumental in the plan of redemption

[2:25:41] only conceive when you came into this
[2:25:43] word

[2:26:24] heavenly father we thank you lord
[2:26:27] you're so good to us lord your mercies
[2:26:31] are new every morning lord we know that
[2:26:35] these things are an impossibility in
[2:26:37] human flesh
[2:26:39] but yet when we look down to the
[2:26:40] scriptures it was always an impossible
[2:26:43] way
[2:26:44] through impossible people unlikely
[2:26:47] individuals
[2:26:48] in insurmountable obstacles
[2:26:51] and that's where you showed yourself
[2:26:54] that's where you displayed your
[2:26:55] attributes
[2:26:56] that's where you showed your great love
[2:26:58] story and if you did it in tamar
[2:27:01] and you did it in rahab you can do it in
[2:27:04] me
[2:27:06] i'm in no worse of a situation than they
[2:27:08] were and i'm in no more of an
[2:27:09] insurmountable circumstance than they
[2:27:11] were
[2:27:12] and if you should choose that way to
[2:27:14] display your great love story
[2:27:16] then you can choose this body of flesh
[2:27:18] right here lord
[2:27:19] and i give myself to you lord that you
[2:27:21] might take me and have preeminence
[2:27:23] inside your bride now lord
[2:27:26] and live your life display your
[2:27:27] attributes live this story out
[2:27:30] before all lord we deny our own thinking
[2:27:33] we deny our own natural identity and we
[2:27:35] take your name
[2:27:37] jesus christ to be our identification
[2:27:41] we love your god and ask your blessing
[2:27:43] to be upon us
[2:27:45] give us your love and your grace your
[2:27:48] strength
[2:27:49] let your spirit be our guide lord let
[2:27:52] your life flow through out of us
[2:27:54] through through us out to others that
[2:27:57] others might come to this household of
[2:27:58] faith
[2:27:59] and find escape from the judgments that
[2:28:01] are coming
