[0:00] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[0:02] heard the salutation of mary the babe
[0:04] leapt in her womb and elizabeth was
[0:06] filled with the holy ghost here we have
[0:09] a supernatural event taking place
[0:12] mary is coming in and she's saluting or
[0:14] greeting her cousin elizabeth and what
[0:17] was that greeting well we know because
[0:19] brother branham tells us she tells
[0:20] elizabeth in the greeting what happened
[0:23] and that she was going to have a baby
[0:24] and his name was jesus and as soon as
[0:26] she spoke the name jesus john the
[0:29] baptist who was laying as dead within
[0:31] elizabeth sprung to life
[0:35] amen
[0:36] because now one woman carrying a promise
[0:41] speaks to another woman carrying a
[0:43] promise
[0:44] and the woman with the promise
[0:47] when she speaks the promise that's
[0:49] within her brings life to the promise
[0:52] that's in the other woman
[0:54] hallelujah
[0:55] and elizabeth filled with the holy ghost
[0:58] begins to prophesy amen at the same time
[1:01] her husband is mute
[1:04] and her husband has been deemed mute
[1:06] because he doubted the promise
[1:10] zacharias in the temple met the same
[1:12] angel amen that mary met and he doubted
[1:15] the promise and he was made dumb he was
[1:18] made a mute he come out of there could
[1:19] not speak amen because the old system of
[1:22] church doubted the timing of the promise
[1:25] amen so the old system of the church the
[1:27] ministry was their mouth was shut and
[1:30] now god is going to speak through the
[1:31] woman
[1:33] because it very much matches the day
[1:35] that we're in now god is speaking
[1:38] through his bride amen and because she
[1:40] she has received the promise and now
[1:43] mary at the time that her husband's a
[1:45] mute amen and because of his doubt she
[1:47] is now elizabeth now is prophesying over
[1:51] mary
[1:52] [Music]
[1:53] amen
[1:54] you think when we get together to
[1:55] fellowship we're just talking but if
[1:57] you're carrying a promise inside of you
[1:59] amen for this day and somebody else is a
[2:02] promise in them but it may be laying
[2:04] dormant it may be dead it may not they
[2:06] may not have felt it warm and kick and
[2:09] move around inside of them yet but if
[2:10] you've got a promise in you and you just
[2:13] go begin to speak what the angel has
[2:15] told you amen it may just bring to life
[2:18] the promise that's laying in another
[2:19] woman
