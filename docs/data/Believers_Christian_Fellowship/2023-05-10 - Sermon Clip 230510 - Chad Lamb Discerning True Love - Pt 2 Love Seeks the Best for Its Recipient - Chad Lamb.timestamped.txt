[0:00] so now there was a very short route to
[0:03] Palestine
[0:04] to the promised land
[0:06] but God didn't take him on the short
[0:08] easy route because God knew that if they
[0:11] went the short easy route they could see
[0:13] War too early and be discouraged so God
[0:16] took him on a much more difficult route
[0:19] and he moved them by way of the Red Sea
[0:21] where they would get pinned in and
[0:22] trapped
[0:24] then he would open up the Red Sea and
[0:26] bring him across then they would get
[0:27] into the Wilderness amen where their
[0:29] bread would run out and then he would
[0:30] provide bread then they would come to
[0:32] where their water ran out and then he
[0:33] would provide water he took them in a
[0:35] much more difficult path than the easy
[0:37] path right across the top skirting right
[0:39] around the Mediterranean Sea and going
[0:41] right into Palestine and you think God
[0:43] can do anything he wants he could just
[0:44] blow him away and move no God God is
[0:47] always doing what's best for the ones he
[0:50] loves
[0:51] so they wouldn't be discouraged before
[0:52] he moves them around and now what's he
[0:55] doing he's taking them by a harder way
[0:57] because the harder way he keeps
[0:59] reinforcing I'm with you I'm covering
[1:01] for you I'm parting the sea I'm feeding
[1:04] you I'm giving you water why how did
[1:06] they know I mean how did they see God
[1:08] manifesting not through the easy route
[1:10] but through the hard route
[1:12] and the hard route gave God the
[1:15] opportunity to continually manifest his
[1:17] love
[1:18] it manifestes protection and provision
[1:21] and Care amen was manifested in the
[1:23] harder way amen we wonder sometimes why
[1:26] is my life always the harder way amen
[1:28] because God has something better for you
[1:31] and I
[1:32] not the easy way it seems like life's so
[1:34] easy for some amen so hard for others
[1:36] amen give me the way that God has chose
[1:39] because the way that God has chose is
[1:41] for my benefit
[1:43] because his love is always for the
[1:45] benefit of the one who's loved
[1:48] he's not he's not mad at us he's not
[1:50] punishing us he's not trying to kill us
[1:55] but he's bringing us into perfection
