[0:00] we had no desire to sin but but we
[0:05] trapped into sin
[0:07] we caught up
[0:10] but that seed Soul attributes Gene
[0:15] always longing
[0:18] for something eternal
[0:22] that's why he sent the Holy Ghost
[0:25] and quickened that seed
[0:29] and when that seed is quickened we
[0:33] recognize
[0:34] the part of the scripture for this day
[0:39] because we are the part of that
[0:41] scripture deep was calling to the Deep
[0:46] and when deep cold there was something
[0:50] deep in us to respond that call
[0:55] amen because
[0:57] the same part was here we are that's all
[1:01] is a part of the world
[1:05] amen
[1:07] so
[1:09] when Jesus came he said I will build my
[1:13] church no man
[1:15] I will build
[1:17] so that church is not something who
[1:22] comes accidentally
[1:25] amen church is was in the mind of God
[1:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:35] and but Branham said that is his great
[1:39] secret the mystery threefold
[1:43] what God was he poured himself into
[1:47] Christ and what Christ was he poured
[1:50] himself into the church and no both
[1:53] together
[1:56] amen God had preeminists in the Sun
[2:01] the same preeminist son has in the
[2:04] church in the pride
[2:06] no both together restored going back in
[2:11] the Garden of Eden
