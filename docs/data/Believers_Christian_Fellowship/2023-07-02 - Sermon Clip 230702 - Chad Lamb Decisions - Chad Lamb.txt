now the whole scene plays out they're coming out of the land and now Naomi's telling them there's no hope for you girls amen I cannot bear you another son Amen to replace the husbands you've lost if I had a husband today and I became pregnant today would you wait 18 19 20 years to have a no you go back to your Homeland and there was two women there and they each made a different choice they made a different decision and one decided to go back what was her what was her motive for going back self-preservation she Naomi already told her I'm destitute I'm desolate I have nothing I have nothing to offer you if you come with me you'll have nothing so she decided that's not the life I want I want something out of life so she goes back amen but Ruth was willing to give up her life amen she had a genuine love for Naomi that superseded her love herself and she began to make this decision I'll go with you don't make me leave you where you go all go where you live I'll live where you die I'll die your God will be my God your people my what did she say I'm not turning back I'm not going any other way she made a clean-cut decision when President preaches Amen on this he preaches the four phases of Ruth he preaches Ruth deciding Ruth working and and all these things but she had to make a clear-cut decision and that decision brought a whole sequence of events in her life not one decision little did she know how could she at that time know that that decision she made would make her in the lineage of Christ one of the mothers of Christ she would bring forth Obed and oh better bring forth Jesse and Jesse would bring forth King David she was going to be a mother of the king line how could she know that she didn't know that she was just moved by her love for Naomi and she made a clear-cut decision she wasn't waffling she wasn't in between she wasn't saying I'll go along for a while and see how it pans out if she had decided that way she would have left when she was beating out her own barley in the field because it wasn't an easy way it wasn't an easy Road and I'm telling you I think so many times people follow this message wishy-washy amen and said I'm going to go along or I'll go to this church or I'll make this decision or I'll go along amen because we've seen when troubles come they vanish amen when things go south and when things go sour when churches fail when Ministries fail amen when it looks like amen the prophets Ministries failing they all vanish away amen but I I want to make a clear-cut decision and say this is the truth this is Christ amen I live in this message I'll die in this message I'll die believing this message
