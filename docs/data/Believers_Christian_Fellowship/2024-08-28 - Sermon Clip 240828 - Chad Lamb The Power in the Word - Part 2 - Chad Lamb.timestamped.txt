[0:00] in the fourth seal the prophet makes
[0:02] this
[0:03] statement the word itself is
[0:06] spirit it's spirit in word
[0:09] form I think it's amazing and I'm just
[0:11] going to share this with you I don't
[0:12] have a solution to all of these
[0:14] statements so don't look at me to
[0:15] explain everything tidy I can't but
[0:18] sometimes brother B said the seed's
[0:19] laying there and it takes the spirit to
[0:21] bring it life but then he said the the
[0:23] the the spirit is the word he says it
[0:25] this way the word itself is spirit it's
[0:28] spirit in word form
[0:30] so where do you get the
[0:32] spirit from the word or from somewhere
[0:35] else to make the word
[0:37] live I think we start over complicating
[0:40] things I think we start making it
[0:42] difficult CU he told us in the
[0:44] scriptures that there three that bear
[0:46] record in heaven the Father the word and
[0:48] the spirit and these three are
[0:51] one amen the true word carries with it
[0:54] the true spirit amen they come together
[0:56] amen there's a spirit of God that will
[0:58] make the word of God live amen I can't
[1:01] tell you whether amen you have to get
[1:03] the word first and then the spirit comes
[1:04] upon the word and makes it live or you
[1:06] get the word when it's preached in the
[1:08] spirit of the word and the spirit of the
[1:10] word I can't tell you how the mechanics
[1:12] of it all I'm just going to tell you
[1:14] that you can't separate these things too
[1:16] far from one another that if you want
[1:18] the spirit you need the word amen if you
[1:20] want the spirit life inside of you you
[1:22] need to get the word if you want the
[1:24] word to live you need the spirit of the
[1:26] word to make it live so don't ask me how
[1:29] to mechanically break that down I can't
[1:31] break it down for you cuz brother
[1:32] Brenham says it both ways and I can't
[1:34] make it neat and tidy but what I can
[1:36] tell you is this word that been given to
[1:38] us in this day has transforming power
[1:40] life inside of it life to bring the life
[1:42] in you to fruition life to bring the
[1:44] word that's preached to
[1:46] manifestation so is it the word that
[1:48] comes to me or the word that's in me
[1:50] it's both friends it's the word that's
[1:52] in you that was planted before the
[1:54] foundation world it's also the word
[1:55] that's coming to you to manifest itself
[1:58] in
[1:58] you so where does the manifested life
[2:01] come from does it come from the nature
[2:03] of God trapped inside the SE Gene of God
[2:05] or does it come from the word that's
[2:06] being preached to me as it manifests
[2:08] itself I'm just going to say both you
[2:10] need both you must have both you have to
[2:13] have a seed and good
[2:16] ground
[2:18] amen I know this it doesn't matter how
[2:21] much seed's inside of you amen you can
[2:23] ask for Holy Ghost to be poured on you
[2:25] all the time but without the preaching
[2:26] of the word there's not going to be a
[2:28] manifestation of the life of the word it
[2:30] takes both amen it takes the word and
[2:33] the spirit it takes the life inside of
[2:35] you and the Life coming to you right
[2:41] amen so let's not over complicate it
[2:44] let's just say God fill me with your
[2:46] word but no I want to be filled with the
[2:48] spirit okay fill me with your spirit
[2:49] how's he going to fill you with the
[2:50] spirit probably going to send you his
[2:54] word I I don't want to complicate this I
[2:58] just want to say this word word that
[3:00] you've given me will do what you sent it
[3:01] to do amen whatever you planted inside
[3:04] of me before the foundation of the world
[3:05] by predestination it's going to do what
[3:07] you ordained it to do this word whether
[3:09] in me or coming to me is not going to
[3:11] return to you void but it'll accomplish
[3:13] what you sent it out to do
