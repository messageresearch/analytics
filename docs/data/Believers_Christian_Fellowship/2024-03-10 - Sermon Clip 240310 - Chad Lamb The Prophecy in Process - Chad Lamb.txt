TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they needed to trust the Lord yes so God would take them through many experiences in the 40-year journey and they would go through the bitter Waters that were turned sweet they would they would they would see the failure of ministry when Aaron pushed by the people took them back to idolatry yes they saw the failure of Moses when he exalted himself when he became angry and was withheld from The Promised Land they saw uh the the anger of the Lord in judgment when they when they when they complained against the Lord and he sent fiery serpents among them but then they saw the salvation of the Lord when he provided a Brazen serpent when they cried for quail he provided when they were attacked by enemies he defeated them all this journey it was all doing something something it was all building something it was molding something everything they go went through there was a new generation coming up what was happening the the the the the thinking of Egypt the slave mentality the thing they've been bound in It's Beginning to leave circumstance by circumstance by circumstance until you find people who hit a hardship they want to go right back to Egypt because at least we had something to eat at Egypt and now you come to a new generation it comes up and there sharpening swords and they can't wait to go into the promised land what happened there was something there was a prophecy in process but the process was doing something it was preparing a people to step into the furtherment of the prophecy we've been in a prophecy and process for 60 plus years now but what God been doing he's been doing all the same things he did in the Exodus Journey we've seen all of those things and those of you who've been around longer than I've been around you've seen them all you've seen the failure of ministry you've seen Ministry exalt themselves you've seen Ministry given to the ons of the people you've seen people complain you've seen people turn back you've seen the Judgment of God and you've seen the mercy of God you've seen the provision of God you've seen fear that comes when an enemy comes and you've seen God raise up some in the camp to defeat the enemy you've seen you've seen Rebellion against god- giv Authority and what happens to them who's been around for a while have you seen those things what was it well we thought it was time we thought that he had come we thought it was the Rapture but now it's been 60 years no this is still the Rapture this is still the coming of the Lord he's coming in Bride form he's still coming to Greater manifestation all that time as what as we travel through all of this we're still smack dab in the middle of the prophecy friends we're not waiting we're here we say coming yeah there's more to be fulfilled but what's being fulfilled is happening right now day by day all around us
