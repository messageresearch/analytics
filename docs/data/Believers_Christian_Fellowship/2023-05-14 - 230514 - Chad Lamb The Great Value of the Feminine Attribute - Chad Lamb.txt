called us to be to manifest what you've called us to manifest in this hour We're depending on you Lord and asking for your help in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen while we're standing we're going to have you turn your Bibles to Genesis but just before we read our scripture brother John alluded to an announcement and I thought he was going to take the announcement and run with it because he has every right to but it's a privilege for me to announce the birth of a new little baby boy so brother Aaron and sister Samantha small wants to welcome Lucas Mateo small amen isn't God good amen we had the privilege of going up and seeing him the other day and he's a cute little guy some anxious to get him here in the church for everyone to see amen God is good we appreciate his goodness and we appreciate a healthy delivery and they're they're all doing well they're back home now so we thank God for that also wanted to remind you that brother Ben siebold is up in Michigan preaching for brother Dan so remember him as he travels back home today and I'd like to say happy Mother's Day amen it's such a privilege to see Godly mothers amen especially amongst our sisters who have given themselves over to the word of God and surrendered their lives to serve their children and their families say God bless you you're an encouragement to us and we love you all and thank God for each one of you amen and I hope you have a wonderful day today amen let's look at Genesis chapter one together just before receding okay Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now let's go over to chapter 5 of Genesis read verse 1 and 2. Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 this is the book of the generations of Adam and the day that God created man and the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam and the day when they were created may God bless you as you take your seats amen this this morning I I would like to take for a subject the great value of the feminine attributes the great value of the feminine attribute amen and we want to take a look at this we start off with a very familiar portion of scripture because we've read this I don't know how many times amen and and we've opened we use it as opening scriptures I can't count how many times amen but it's a pertinent theme to us in the day we live in because this is the bride age and we see in the very beginning that God created man in his own image and and as he made man in his own image he made him male and female so we've been through this many times we understand this but but they were they were one they were always intended to be one and even when they came forth in two manifestations or two expressions they were two expressions of the same thing they were two parts of the one unit two parts of the same thing so there's man and the woman he made them male and female and called their name Adam and the day that they were created so we see that they amen were created to be singular Adam amen so it's it's a beautiful picture and we're going to get into that later as we go but we know that that with within Adam amen was the woman she was there with him in spirit amen and she had the masculine and the feminist spirit and God would take and separate that and he would bring them back together and so we see that part of the attribute or the expression of gone is male and female because man was made in the image of God male and female made he him so the expression of God can be expressed in male and in female and I would like to turn quickly to Proverbs chapter 8 just to take a quick look at something here Proverbs chapter 8. Proverbs chapter 8 verse 1. in Proverbs chapter 8 verse 1 it says doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of past she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming into the doors unto you o men I call my voice to the sons of man so now we're being introduced to a person called wisdom amen that this is a a a manifestation or portrayal of wisdom and wisdom that is expressed and feminine she cries she calleth and if we go over to verse 22 we'll pick up more of this understanding of who this wisdom is uh chapter 8 verse 22 the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way this is the same the same one Speaking the same voice the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning wherever the Earth was when there was no depths I was brought forth when there was no fountains abounding with the wall with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the death when he established the clouds above when the strength in The Fountains of the deep when he gave the sea is decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him this is the scripture brother Brennan refers to when he says I could see that little logo it's like a polar fire playing at the feet of God like a child and you look at this scripture in in the scripture he's actually referring to this person called wisdom which we can see is a is a manifestation of the word amen amen so let's keep reading here let's read verse 30 again then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable parts of his Earth and my Delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me owe you children for blessed are they that keep my ways hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my Gates waiting at the post of my doors for who so findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favor of the Lord but he that sinneth against me wrong with his own soul all they that hate me love death so this is this is a an expression of the word of God Amen and it's called wisdom and wisdom is referred to in the feminine and we see that this wisdom comes from God it's actually an expression of the word of God and so there's an expression here that's in feminine amen but it's wisdom it's the one that was with God that was there to establish all the deep that was there before anything else was there so God is expressed in both male and female and here comes an expression of the word called wisdom and it's in the form of she amen not a second person not a different person but just an expression amen because we see in the Christ and we see with Adam amen that which comes out of the mail is a female amen what come out of Adam was feminine what come what come out of Christ is his bride and here when the word comes forth he's expressing it in feminine and then he'll take that word and he'll put it in body form of a son and express it masculine but within the masculine is also the feminine and when he brings out of the masculine in another expression it's feminine so God can be expressed in male and female God is expressing himself amen by that which comes out of him United back to him and all of these things are expressing God so the things that we see are here to express or they're Shadows of greater things greater truths amen so God is expressed in male and female let's go back to Genesis 17. just want to keep establishing this this understanding as we move forward Genesis 17 and verse 1 Genesis 17 and 1 and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect this word almighty God is actually El Shaddai and here's what brother Brown says about El Shaddai he said in Genesis 17 he is Abraham's nursing breast El Shaddai but when his life was gone from him God said a man a hundred years old how will this thing be I am old my wife is old how can these things be he said I am El Shaddai now L is the and the Shaddai is breast and Shaddai is plural which means I am the breasted God like a baby that's fretting and sick and his strength is gone from it lean upon the mother's bosom and nurse his strength back sure when it's nursing it's not fretting no more at the mother's breath it's satisfied while it's getting its strength so we see now God is is is referring to himself as the breasted God because God is expressed in male and female amen now in the message thirst brother Graham says notice Jerusalem the word Jerusalem is from above he's speaking of New Jerusalem and the Bible said which we are is the mother of us all and Christ is our mother we realize that God is our mother for we are born of him so God is both father and mother amen he's expressing himself in these he tells Jerusalem I would have how often I would have hovered you as a hen does her chicks amen he's speaking as a mother hen guards over text that's what I would have done for you he's expressing himself both in masculine and in feminine amen so this is this is important to understand as we move down through the Bible and actually get into the subject that we want to get into the value amen the value or or I don't know if I said value or what did I say the great value of the feminine attribute so I want to look at a couple quotes here brother Brown says and questions and answers on Genesis back in 1953 so when God took from his side a piece of him a rib and made a woman now where did he get the spirit woman he said in Genesis 1 26 he said let us make man in our image after our own likeness created he he them man male and female he made the Burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate finished spirit for the woman and when you see a woman acting like a man she's got out of her place you see and in the beginning she's supposed to I think it's a shame that a woman has lost her dainty feminist place it's a disgrace further down in Jehovah Jireh from 1964 he says God's spirit Cuts see the body the bride of Christ has to come right back to the first now what was Eve her and Adam were the same they were called Adam they were Spirit when he formed man the first time he made him in his own image and God is a spirit in the image of God created him male and female created he them he said and then still there was no man to till the soil and God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and put his dual spirit in him and that was the first Adam so we know that Adam had both masculine and feminine in him amen but God was going to separate it out into two expressions that were to be unified and be won expressing male and female amen so I want to go on just a little bit further with a couple more quotes he says now and then when Adam come and then Adam looked Lonesome so he took a rib from his side and made Eve a byproduct for him and and he'd taken the finished Spirit out of Adam and put it in the woman the love Spirit feminist kind gentle and he left the masculine spirit in Adam now if there's anything different there's a perversion somewhere now and then the two was one so when God when God had a main man in his own image male and female he created to them this dual Spirit was within Adam amen but but God said it's not good that man shall dwell alone I will make a help meet for him so he pulled out of him amen a rib to make the the Flesh of the woman but he pulled and separated that spirit that feminist Spirit from Adam amen and put it in the woman and then he United the two back together and he said it was very good and so we see that God intends for the feminist Spirit the feminist nature to be expressed God wants it to be expressed God intended for it to be expressed amen that's why and and the day we live in there's been such an attack on what truly is feminine what truly uh does it mean to be a woman the lines have been blurred and brother Ben said that's a perversion that's not what God wanted when God separated it he wanted a masculine expression and a feminine expression he did not want them to melt into one he did not want them to move nearer to one another where a woman would become masculine and a man would become feminine that's not God's intention God's intention was to make man after his image and then that man would Express God upon the Earth and in that expression God would see to it that he would separate the feminist out into a form called woman and the masculine in a form called man and God wanted it to be that way and he wants them both to be expressed so that's why the male has to be expressed and the female has to be expressed and that's what I want to get into as we go on this expression of the feminine and so that's why he says there's a perversion there's a mix up something's wrong God this this laodicean age this perversion that we walk in amen it's absolutely contrary to the nature of God Amen but it's perfectly come to Satan's Eden because Satan is trying to distort everything that's God so nobody gets a clear image of God anymore and then it becomes wrong to stick with God now you become wrong if you if you really believe that there's a distinction in the Sexes and and that they're meant to be separated and remain separated and not to blend back into one another amen and and tell a girl you can be anything you want to be you can do this and a boy you can do anything you want to be and no that's not what God wants that's not what he intended from the beginning it's not God's desire he wanted a woman to be feminist loving dainty kind gentle all these things the prophet uses and he wants the man to be burly not brutish but rugged early a masculine man that's what God wants and I just want to I don't have this in my notes but I just want to go on and say the world we live in everything in the world is structured to deform this all right not just the social uh constraints and the social the the common thinking of the day the education system and all of that it's not just that but brother Branham was very clear to tell us amen that men are becoming sisified I'll just use his language and women are becoming more masculine and brother Branham tied it to the hybridization of food that's amazing to me but if I'm tied it to the hybrid he said it's mixing up the genes the cells are changing because of food and that's why when we bow our heads to pray it's not just a ritual it's not just a tradition because this world is perverted in every way the Earth has been perverted farming has been perverted why has it been perverted because of lust because of greed farming practices have perverted everything's perverted amen everything's marketing everything's for profit and all greed is driving all of these things and it's driven by an evil spirit so what are we going to do I I don't know what else to do but go to the store and buy the food and go to the restaurant do what we do but I know one thing I can bow my head and say God I'm going to need help with this meal that I'm eating because this world has been perverted by mankind because it's actually changing something in the natural side of man that's why I think when we see those things creep up amen where where you see a little bit of a feminist nature and a boy or a little bit masculine a girl I would be careful not to hammer on that too hard because it may be the perversion of food I say what that needs is some prayer for deliverance and say God maybe maybe there's an effect here of the of the natural world around us God we need a healing we need a deliverance we need you to come on the scene and make what you called masking and masking what you call feminist feminists amen so when some people say I just can't help but I feel this way they may be speaking the truth that may be true according what the prophet told us but what we need to realize is it doesn't have to stay that way he's still the great healer the I am the deliverer the one who can change all circumstances he's the god that healeth all your diseases if food creates a perversion he can he can take care of that amen so the world is all structured to to corrupt this image of God expressed as male and female amen but God has really uh preserved it and he's restored it in our day he says in the message choosing of a bride now we find in the beginning man and woman were put on co-equal terms they were to be one they were to rule and Reign together as one but then uh but then the woman was brought brother bear says as a byproduct right he explains to us how she came differently than every other woman in creation and she came from the rib she was made out of what was already made and she was fashioned now that that's what he means by byproduct and then within her spirit amen she's got the original part of Adam's Spirit which was meant to be female but the flesh was the byproduct for him and brother Brown says she was made this way because God knew there would be a fall and he made her in such a way that she was capable of falling we understand this and so that fall began to change something and the co-equal status as far as flesh is concerned I really want to be clear on that I'm speaking as far as flesh and Earthly walk and Earthly existence is concerned I'm not talking about the soul amen and there's reason I want to get into that because I feel like sometimes because of misunderstandings about headship and misunderstandings about masculinity and feminine what God wants to be feminist because of that amen there's there's there can be a legalistic strict structure and when the actual the feminist spirit is actually suppressed under the male spirit but God wants that feminine Spirit to express he meant for it to be so the only reason that she was placed under headship she was placed under headship for this life because of the Fall that's what brother bear says in the message choosing of a brine she was not in the original creation all other females is in the original creation bird male female animals male and female but in human life God only made a man and he took from him and a woman is the byproduct of a man because God did not Institute such a thing search the scriptures exactly right God no sir in his original creation she was put out there but then listen what he says but if she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than a man why because God knows the structure of a woman in this Earthly form in human form she was the byproduct made in a way that could be deceived and could be susceptible to the fall so now if she can hold herself being born in this flesh under this corruption if she can hold herself in the right way she can have a greater reward than the man can because the man wasn't built that way that makes sense so she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than man she she's put on a testing ground through her come death she's guilty of all death but then God turned around and used one to bring life back again brought his son through the woman an obedient one so though the woman was what was in the fall brought the transgression and the degradation of humanity through hybridization amen one was used Amen to the to the the degeneration in the fall of Man but praise God God would use another woman amen born in flesh a woman and he would use her for the restoration process so God now when God placed the woman under man's headship he's no longer saying I'm only going to use the mail I'm only going to use the male expression I'm only going to uh express myself through mail no he's still going to use the female to express himself and he's still going to use one to bring forth the promised son praise God let's look at First Corinthians chapter 11. First Corinthians chapter 11. First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 9. foreign in First Corinthians 11 9 says when no I'm sorry I'm in second Corinthians let me go to First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 9. neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God so God now has created a a a a a relationship where the woman come from the man but now in this earth man has come from the woman and God is still using the woman to bring forth amen his children upon the Earth right so so God God is still using both expressions I'd like to look at a few examples in the Bible and then I want to tie this together let's go to First Samuel chapter one and I'm just going to hit a couple of examples out of the Bible first Samuel and there's so many examples we certainly won't try to get to them all we may reference a few and not read the scriptures but we're going to read a couple scriptures of a couple of these and in first Samuel chapter 1 verse 9. We're The Story of Hannah says so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the post of the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said O Lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but will give unto thine handmade a man-child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not her therefore Eli thought she had been drunken and Eli said unto her how long will thou be drunk and put away thine wine from thee and Hannah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord count not thy hand made for a daughter of Belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto then Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou has asked of him and she said let thine handmaid find Grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad so we see Hannah now is struggling with barrenness and in the struggle with baroness she goes into the temple and as she goes into the temple she is now praying and pouring her heart out to God and she makes a vow to God that if God would give her this man child she would give it back to him amen and she does all of this amen and then comes in contact with Eli and you realize that God is expressing something through Hannah Hannah has a husband but God's not going straight to the husband he's expressing something through Hannah we see this all the way through the Bible and let's look at verse 19. let's read a little bit further and they arose up in the morning early in worship before the Lord and returned and came to their house in Rhema and elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hanac conceived that she bear a son and called his name Samuel saying because I have asked him of the Lord and the man elkana and all his house went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow but Hannah went not up for she said unto her husband I will not go up until the child be weaned and then I will bring him that he may appear before the Lord and there abide forever and Elkin her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the Lord establish his word so the woman Abode and gave her son suck until she had weaned him I love this story because we're planted right in the Old Testament right under the patriarchal system right under the headship through the tribes and everything in Israel but in this story Hannah is is crying out to God to deliver her for bareness and she's she's vowing a vow to God and this is all taking place between Hannah and God now Eli the priest the high priest sees it he puts a blessing upon her she goes to her home amen and and and she conceives because God remembered her and then when it comes time to worship amen when it comes time to go she told her husband I'll not go until the child is weaned then I'll take the child and deliver him deliver him there amen she's the one decreeing she's the one saying she's the one with the vision she was the one with the prayer she's the one who got the blessing she's the one God remembered but then her her husband Elkin in his wisdom amen he could have stopped that because he's the head but in his wisdom he recognized that this is God he recognized that this thing is of God and he says amen he says do all that is in your heart let's see what he says verse 23 in Elk and our husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the Lord establishes word so the woman Abode so now elkana he recognizes that there's something going on here that's God Amen he could assure usurp his authority he could say though that's my child you can't give my child away oh Hannah did all of this amen and when Hannah expressed it all her husband says do what seemeth good I think I find these things amazing friends because sometimes they twist up our understanding because God God you know when it comes to the soul realm amen there's no dis equaling between the male and female when it comes to God it's only in this Natural Life amen God has put a woman under protection I want to go to first Samuel 25. I said I just want to hit a couple of examples and we know them well but I want to read through just a couple first Samuel chapter 25. and we'll read verse 23 and and and first Samuel amen nabel is a wicked man and he refuses David's request and David's going down he's strapping a sword he's going down to wipe out the household of nabel and he's coming down in righteous judgment but the wife of nabel is Abigail and she's a righteous woman and she's going to approach unto David and look at what she says here in verse 23. and when Abigail saw David she hastened and lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground and fell at his feet and said upon me my Lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thy handmaid I pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid let not my Lord I pray thee regard this man of Belial even nabel for as his name is so is nabel his name means fool is he is his name and Folly is with him but I I thine handmade Saul not the young men of my Lord whom thou did Sin now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul liveth seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my Lord be as Nable and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my Lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my Lord I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmade for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord and evil hath not been found in thee all the days yet a man has risen to pursue pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God listen she is absolutely speaking the truth she is speaking the word amen so that but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God and the soul of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed the ruler over Israel that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offensive heart unto my Lord neither that thou has shed blood causeless or that my Lord hath Avenged himself but when the Lord shall have dealt with with my Lord then remember thine handmade and David said to Abigail blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me well now David is recognizing this isn't just this woman God sent you here let's read the skin and David said to Abigail blessed be the Lord God of Israel David is a prophet David is ordained to be a King David is wise he's the great Psalm writer amen and here he recognizes that God is speaking to him through this woman let's read on David uh reads 32 again and David said to Abigail blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me and blessed be thy advice I love this who's giving advice to David a woman and blessed be thy advise and blessed be thou which has kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from amending myself with my own hand when she begins to speak she begins to recognize in the wisdom that God had granted her she began to recognize that David surely is coming to be king amen and God will take care of all David's enemies but don't let this be an offense and don't let this be a grief that you came and you shed blood amen you realize up to now David has shed no blood of his Israelite Brethren only Philistines this would be the first time that Abigail had not stood in the Gap and not preserved him his reputation and his kingdom God was working through her Amen to save David though there'd be no grief and no offense to David when he comes into his kingdom and David recognized it he said God be blessed the God who sent you to speak to me this day amen and and thank God for your advice amen I love when this pops up in the Old Testament we find all the way through the Bible God has used both the male and female expression it's never been one-sided with God God is not ashamed to speak through the lips of a woman God is not ashamed to give wisdom to a woman amen God and why because in the end time we know God is going to raise up a woman and she's going to have something to say so God has been expressing it all down through the Bible now let's go to second Samuel 20. joab has come and encompassed about a city and he's going to destroy a city because a rebel a rebel from the house of Saul who's rebelling against David had entered in and we see that there's going to be a woman who saves the city second Samuel 20. verse 19. this woman begins to call to joab from the wall and she says I am one of them that are Peaceable and faithful in Israel thou seek us to destroy a city and a mother in Israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the Lord and job answered and said far be it far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy the matter is not so but a man of Mount Ephraim Sheba the son of bikrai by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against David deliver him only and I will depart from the city and the woman said to joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall then the woman went into all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Vikram and cast it out to joab and he blew the trumpet and retired from the city every man to his tent and job returned to Jerusalem unto the king now here they come into a city was there was there no wise man in there but God allowed it that there was a woman with wisdom begins to cry out say joab why are you destroying the inheritance of God why are you doing this and joy begins to tell and she says his head will be thrown over the wall before she speaks to anybody then it says she goes in her wisdom my I thought everything had to come by the Kings by the governor no here's a wise woman that is saving the city it goes to show God's not only going to use the mail God's going to use the female also he did All Through the Bible he used both praise God remember Naomi when it came time for Redemption Naomi was the one who came up with the plan Naomi instructed Ruth Ruth followed Naomi's instructions and then Boaz was the only one who can bring Redemption amen but but Naomi knew how to move Boaz to get the Boaz to take his place and it came through the wisdom of Naomi so Naomi gave the instructions Ruth acted out the instructions Boaz played the part of the Kinsmen Redeemer we see this all through the Bible remember when abimelech amen the the son of Gideon he raised up through deception and became a judge who was it the destroyed a Bimal act it was a woman and a tower who cast a piece of millstone out of the tower amen and broke his skull Deliverance come by a woman praise God I love how all these things are in the Bible when we come to the New Testament we enter into the New Testament and God now begins to deal amen through the New Testament Church the confirmation of the promise amen when he comes to Mary a angel visits Mary and speaks the word to Mary and Mary receives the word and then when she runs over to tell amen when she runs over to tell her cousin Elizabeth immediately when she gave a salutation to Elizabeth the Babe jumped within her she was filled with the Holy Ghost and she begins to prophesy amen the first recorded prophecy we have in the New Testament is Elizabeth prophesying and then as soon as she's done prophesying Mary begins to prophesy praise God God is good let's look at Luke chapter 2. Luke chapter 2. and verse 36. foreign chapter 2 verse 36 and there was Anna a prophet is the daughter of fanuel of the tribe of Asser she was of a great agent and lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about four score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she came in that instant giving thanks likewise unto the Lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem amen when Jesus was brought into the temple Simeon amen the priest he comes and he knew the Lord would not let him depart till he sees the Lord's the salvation and deliverance but there was another one there there was a woman a prophetess by the name of Anna she was led by the spirit brother Branham says to come and find Jesus and also to Proclaim to all who wanted redemption in Israel she was proclaiming the prophecy now was fulfilled not just Simeon but Anna as well amen so we can see that God is being expressed in male and female let's go to Genesis 16. there's so many things in each one of these stories we could elaborate on but I just don't want to take the time because I want to keep moving with the thought that I have foreign you see when God now he wants to express himself in male and female and this is God's Design This is God's desire amen and you'll find that's why when God through his we know through his uh not his perfect will but his permissive will when he allowed children to be born the way they are I mean it's even perfectly timed and God's permissive will because you have to have two parts to bring life you have to have male and female a male alone can't do it a female alone can't do it but when the male and female come together amen even in God's permissive will it can produce life amen so so the man has the life he has the seed he has the the the the the gene of life but there must come in contact with the female also so that the she becomes the betting ground of life and then life can come forth so so God Is So structured it that way and then God wants an expression in this holy Union in this marriage of male and female that's why God didn't make us the same that he didn't put two of the same together he put a male and a female together because together it's an expression when they come together in unity it's an expression of God it's a better expression it's a richer more full expression that's why when you see the that the enemy has worked so hard to break apart families through divorce and separation why because it's never right it's never right and some people find themselves in circumstances because of sin because of the Fall now there's a this plague has broke out among human beings and death now is set in so some people were raised in a single parent home because of death some because of divorce some because of all of these other circumstances but it's never right amen it's never exactly right and I know because I grew up that way my parents were divorced when I was five years old so I know what I'm talking about amen it's not exactly right because God wants to bring two together to express one and that expression together in unity is a fuller expression of God it takes both sides it takes the masculine and the feminine side to raise up children to be balanced healthy children amen it doesn't that's that's just the natural course of life and if you find yourself in that way God can help God can intervene God can deliver but just a natural course of life God brought together a male and a female to express masculine and feminist to nurture up and raise these children and that's why we have such issues we have because that picture is broken so often in a home so often that is destroyed and you have people like myself and others generationally now we've grown up without this picture and it's taken an effect on society people are not balanced and I'm not talking spiritual I'm talking just natural things just a natural human being they're not balanced even in their understanding of the world they're not logically thinking they're not they don't have what we used to call Common Sense and it's not just the broken home it's so many things that mix in together but it all goes to paint the picture but what God wanted he wanted an expression of male and female and these children to be raised in that kind of home that's under his permissive will that's what he set up whenever you break what God has set up whatever you break it it's going to be deformed it's going to have problems so we we have to recognize that God Did It for a reason God wants it that way so that means also in the home there must be an expression of masculine and feminist I mean it makes sense it's so easy to see but but sometimes if we don't respect one another if the if the husband doesn't respect his wife and the wife doesn't respect his husband you can have one that'll trample over the expression of the other or limit or quiet the expression of another you can have a dominant woman and a dominant woman brother Branham says a dominating female he said is the greatest curse the Earth has ever seen that's what he says and you can have a woman that would Dominate and dominate her husband her husband would check out that's his fault he should have never done and he should have held his place but now amen you've got a perversion of female and you've got an absence of true masculine and that's not going to work but then you can also have a man who becomes too dominant in his role of headship and he silences his wife she has no right to protest she can't question his authority she can't ask him anything and all of a sudden he quiets her amen and now limits her and she becomes withdrawn under his uh domineering legalistic not a not a true masculine man but an overbearing man who who doesn't respect the feminist spirit and pulls back now that's going to have problems in that home as well because God wants both to be expressed those little kids need to see both expressed just like the world needs to see both expressed so we see we have to respect one another and we have to respect what God made one another in in Who We Are let's go to Genesis 16. let's look at verse one I want to look at Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 16 1 now Sarah Abram's wife Sarah Abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmade an Egyptian whose name was haggar and Sarah I said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray that you go into my maid it may be that I may uh I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah so he listened to his wife let's go over to Genesis 21 now just 21 verse 9. now in Genesis 21 verse 9 it says and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which he had borne unto Abraham mocking wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be Heir with my son even with Isaac and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son all right let's think about this now Sarah gave advice before and she advised him to take Hagar he hearkened to the voice of Sariah's wife and now Ishmael was born but now that Isaac is born amen there's been a transformation in Sarah Isaac now is born and and now as she sees the son of the Bond woman Ishmael mocking and now she makes another suggestion she makes another decree to Abraham and said cast out the son of the Bond woman let's read it again cast out this Bond woman and her son for the son of this Bond woman shall not be Heir with my son even with Isaac and when Abraham first heard this advice he didn't like it do we agree and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the Bond woman and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken under her voice for an Isaac shall thy seed be called now God comes down and backs up Sarah has caught something amen and she begins to express it and says this will not be this son will not be heir of my son amen and the thing was Grievous to Abram Abraham didn't want to cast him out Abraham didn't want her to be right Abraham didn't want to listen to her but God came down and said hearken to the voice of Sarah she's right amen she was wrong before but she's right now and just because she was wrong before doesn't make her right now is that true it's gone and so right that the Apostle Paul in Galatians chapter 4 verse 30 he would pick up this phrase and in Galatians 4 30 it says never let us watch saith the scripture what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bomberman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman who spoke that scripture Sarah did all the way back here in Genesis so the the son of the Bond woman now Paul picks it up and God recognized Sarah told the truth God recognized that Abraham listened to it and even confirmed it all the way in the New Testament when the Apostle Paul picked it up and called it scripture saying so God God is not afraid to express himself in male and female just because he put the man in headship doesn't mean he's afraid to express himself through the woman and it doesn't mean the woman never has anything to say Abigail had something to say Hannah had something to say Sarah had something to say the wise woman that saved the city had something to say Amen Tamar had something to say something to do because Tamar was the one who saved Judah God is not ashamed to work through both praise God now I I don't want anybody to get the wrong impression that somehow we're trying to uh over over evaluate the women and get the women to take leadership that's not God's way but neither do we want to ignore God's way we want to walk in the middle of the road it would stay balanced in everything we do and the message marriage and divorce brother member says notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order he's speaking of Eve she was right with man co-equal with men but we all know now that she lost her co-equaleness with man when she sinned and God said man will be your ruler from here out now that's the scripture if you want to we could read it but remember saying now because of the Fall she's not co-equal in this life with man she is now under headship amen but it doesn't change the fact that she is within her expressing a nature and part of God amen let's look at First Timothy chapter 2. see this in the scripture that brother Ben was referring to First Timothy chapter 2. verse 11. the scripture says let the women learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffered not a woman to teach nor to serve authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first form then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression and I was standing she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith in charity and Holiness with sobriety so now the scripture is very clear brother Ben referred to this she is not to usurp Authority that's why a woman cannot handle the word cannot preach the word she cannot hold an office in the church amen because because those roles because of the Fall because she was deceived in the transgression she has been put underneath the headship of man for protection in the things of natural life and and for the order of the church amen God called for men to take leadership and headship in the church never a woman amen because that is contrary to God's Will and contrary to God's word because why because she was made in a way she could be deceived amen so because of that she's put under head she said amen that's why like I said A woman can't handle the word she cannot preach those those roles are more masculine roles giving out seed giving out leadership and then the church now is receiving it that's a female role and when a man and a woman come together the man has the seed amen the woman is the receptor of the seed he sows the seed she receives the seed but then what does she do then she manifests the very seed she received because she's impregnated and she gives birth to a son or a daughter amen so this is the process amen the man is giving the seed the church the bride the woman is receiving the seed and manifesting what she's received amen that's why that's why every Church must be under a pastor there must be headships she can't be on her own amen but but under that hedge if there's Ministry there's a fightful Ministry that comes which is the ministry of Christ it's not just Menace the ministry of Christ Christ's now giving out his seed word now the church receiving it and manifesting it that's why we don't look to the ministers to do all the manifestation it's the manifestation comes through the bride body because the natural types the spiritual but the bride doesn't have seed to sow she receives it amen Christ is deceiving does Christ come through the body yes that's what preaching is all about but everything's a shadow a shadow a shadow a shadow that's why women don't use serp Authority but I'll say this this because a woman was commanded not to a serp authority over man doesn't mean she never has a valuable perspective hope we can catch this just because she's not to lead just because she cannot break the word just because you cannot preach the gospel does not mean that she should be silenced because she wasn't all through the Bible it doesn't mean she doesn't have valuable perspective now remember when brother Benham told us that God in the beginning he separated out the masculine and feminist Spirit from Adam amen and he made any and he made a male and female amen then now Adam Adam now doesn't have within himself what God separated it is now in this other body so the only way for Adam to get it is to have fellowship with the woman does that make sense I hope you see what I'm saying now he's got to now this was all in one vessel but that's not in one vessel anymore now he separated it out and he's placed it within the woman now he's got to come in contact with the woman and have fellowship with the woman to get that part that now he no longer has so just because God has called men to lead the church doesn't mean there's no value in the women in the church because we're still if I could say this way we're still lacking some perspective every man who's honest he understands this in his own home if he really wants to have a successful home he's going to pay attention to his wife he can't always listen to his wife and I don't mean listen he can't always do what she says because sometimes she's right and sometimes she's wrong I think that's fair as it goes for all of us the man sometimes right and sometimes he's wrong so the man can never just say well my wife's got a valuable point of view she's got something to say so I'm not even going to make the decision we'll let her make the decision you're wrong if you do that and I don't know any Christian women I don't know any sisters that want to take authority and want to take the headship I don't know and he says they want to be submissive it's in their nature amen they're expressing that nature they don't want to be dominant they don't want to be bold they don't want to be loud they don't want to argue they don't want to force an issue they want to be under subjection but I think sometimes what where we fail and I some sometimes where you'll see a woman become more dominant or start to argue I think she's being silenced and she has no voice I don't think she's afraid to be under headship I think she's afraid of having no voice because if we take away the voice of the feminist Spirit we are missing something God is expressed in male and female God wants a man to be masculine and have that Burly nature and that masculine wants him to lead wants him to watch over and protect and guard his wife and cherish her and protect her and the children but he wants the woman not to be Burly and he wants the woman to be a nurturer and have a sweet spirit and so she the the dad and the mom and the husband and the wife they have a different approach even to the children and if we learn to let God work through both we're going to have a good home and we're going to have well well-balanced and raised children but if one or the other is eliminated we're destined for trouble praise God so so God has set it up this way it's good for us if we recognize what God has done and not take our own ideas and and push one side too far one way and one too far the other way but we know Sarah even though Sarah spoke to Abraham Sarah was in submission to Abraham even though she had she had the right word let's look at this in First Peter First Peter chapter 3 . First Peter chapter 3 verse 1. likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one with the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plating of hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price God likes the feminine nature and he likes a feminine a woman to express the feminine nature I want to read that again he says Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God Adorn themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge I love this scripture this scripture is all about subjections subjection the woman subject herself to her own husband even as Sarah amen called her husband Lord and and I I for years had come in contact with people who resented that scripture I come in contact with some women at some times who resented that and they said I've heard it preached so many times and then and you being subjected to your husband and call your husband Lord the way Sarah called her husband Lord and and I began to question why would anybody get so frustrated with the Bible verse unless there's a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the verse how could anybody get so frustrated with the scripture or hear a scripture read and have a repulsion but we've all had that if you've been beat down in the wrong way or had scripture misused against you've been manipulated by a scripture whatever then you can have repulsion when you hear it read but I used to question why am I why am I meeting resistance and why are people I'm recoiling when you say you know call your you you be a Sarah who called her husband Lord you say am I supposed to call him Lord I mean I just read the Bible it's not me I didn't say you should say this or that I'm just reading the scriptures and it's not what title you give it's the attitude it's the reverence it's the respect it's the attitude why because this is what God wants but I began to find sometimes the problem is on the flip side and find it here in verse 7 likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge there's something you need to understand as well with your wife dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together heirs together this this inheritance is not one over the other this is Joint heirs being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered now he flips it over to the husband to say now now listen you need to dwell with your wife according to knowledge yes she must be in submission yes she must have the attitude of calling you Lord like Sarah did in the women of old absolutely that's the scripture but this is also the scripture to dwell with them according to knowledge understanding understand your wife amen giving honor I love this giving honor where am I I've lost my verse seven giving honor unto the wife as unto their weaker vessel this weaker vessel is an interesting term because it it initially it looks like inferior right so if two guys are standing next to each other and one guy says I'm stronger you're weaker that seems to be inferior but this is not what we're talking about in weaker vessel this weaker vessel means fragile or delicate and most everything we have of Great Value is fragile or delicate and why is she fragile or delicate because she's a byproduct she was made in such a way that she could be deceived she was put under the headship of man and man is to give her honor to dwell with her according to knowledge and give her honor as unto a weaker vessel she is more delicate than you you can't treat her like another man and I find that so many times amen us men we make mistakes and I made mistakes early in my marriage and truth be known I still make mistakes because I I think my wife should think like me and I don't understand why she doesn't think like me and when she's not thinking like me I'm thinking what is wrong with you you're not thinking like me and she's over here thinking what is wrong with you like for me the picture's so clear for me over here the picture's so clear because we have two different perspectives based off the nature that's been placed within us and and because man is given to rule over the woman he's given the rule over here but according to knowledge giving honor unto her as unto the weaker vessel how do we honor a week of vessel well if you have a vase that's worth a lot of money you honor it by putting it on a pedestal you keep it safe you put it in a case you put it up High where the kids can't break it that's giving honor to one as a weaker vessel and this is how we're supposed to care for our wives giving honor to them as a weaker vessel means we protect them we guard them we shelter them we protect them amen we're not too harsh with them amen we're not too rugged amen I I can talk to another man rough I've done it with my friends before I've had a conversation and it's just been straightforward I mean not me nobody was mad we're straightforward I'd say no I disagree with you if you see two men working amen and you guy calls all those buddies ever they're going to build a shed and all of a sudden they're standing around well I think you should do it this way I said no I'm not going to do it that way I want to do it this way but what about this I think you're going to have a problem later you say leave me alone I know what I'm doing and all those guys can work on that project and they're fine at the end of it amen they go eat some pizza they pat each other in the back they had a great day you throw one woman into the mix and she's in tears in the house wondering why everybody's so mean and why do you talk to each other like that the problem is she's of a nature that God wants her to have and a man's of a nature God wants him to have neither one or wrong but when I begin to if I don't dwell with my wife according to knowledge and I expect her to act like me view everything like me respond to everything like me then what I'm doing is because I have the headship and I'm giving headship that way I'm pushing her down and pushing her down and pushing her down and all of that feminine nature that God wants to be expressed is being hindered inhibited Limited right I don't think that's what God wants I don't think that's what he wants in his marriage I don't want to think that's what he wants out of his bride I don't think God Amen I don't think God wants a Ministry so harsh and so hard and so legalistic that the bride has no expression she's hindered she's hampered she has nothing to say she hasn't she's never right she doesn't know what she's talking about I don't think that's what God wants I think God wants both expressed male and female I think he created it so I think he's expressing male and female I think he wants an expression of male and female so when when Abraham now is hearing from Sarah her next piece of advice about the son that she was responsible for and all of a sudden he's confused God comes in and sorts out the confusion and Abraham now knows what to do amen and it goes to show that that that none of us are always right none of us are always right but I'll say it this way the man has a right to be wrong because he's the one who has to make the decision somebody has to make this somebody has to take leadership at the end of the day it's his choice and if it's wrong he's got the right to make the wrong choice but also he's the one who Bears the responsibility for the wrong choice he's got a right to make that wrong choice in the home dad's got a right to make the wrong choice and mom's not going to go to manipulation tactics to force the screaming to to refusing no that's not a Christian home he's got a right but he's got the responsibility to take care of the consequences of that choice and if that be so I think it would behoove us all to recognize it certainly would be me and behoove me to recognize that there is another voice here and there's another perspective on the same situation that might help me get a clearer picture of what I'm looking at before I make my decision it might at least I want to hear before I make my decision let's look at this in the scripture let's go to Matthew 27. thank you Matthew 27 verse 19. this is the trial of Jesus this is pilate when he was set down on the Judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and Elders persuaded the multitude and they should ask Barabbas and Destroy Jesus hear the wife of Pilate comes and gives him the best advice he has received in this whole situation and she was right and she was a pagan she wasn't even a Jewish believer she wasn't even believing the true word but she says the wife sentenced him saying I have have nothing to do with this just man she declares him just which pilate was already figuring out she confirmed what he already knew have nothing to do with this just man for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him it's amazing that Pilot's Wife got the dream not Pilate but pilate's wife and pilate were one according to the workings of God according to the way God set it up and it's amazing how many times that God will work through one or the other amen and one nature may be a little more sensitive than the other nature and one may be a little more I don't know I don't know all the terms to use but they have different different approaches or different aspects or different perspectives on the same issue and and she was able to pick up on something is that fair pilate's wife was able to pick up on something and she dreamed it in a dream and she came to pilate and what she said was right have nothing to do with this just man but pilate was already caught in the Trap and he was in the political web and he was going to be used Amen to fulfill the word of God regardless but she still was picking up on something and her perspective was right and when she picked up on it if if he would have been able to if it wouldn't have been the will of God if he had been able to heed her advice he would have saved himself trouble for the rest of his days so you can see that there's value to the expression of feminine and masculine I mean we want to keep everything in its order but we don't want to miss out on what God's given us we don't want to miss the picture because God wants to express himself in both I know I know there's many times that my wife will catch something she'll catch it in her spirit and she'll be right she doesn't know how to express it and I have no idea what she's catching and trying to express it it's just like a little warning and I'll watch and I've seen that thing be perfect before I've seen that be perfect she picked up on something not even understanding it all the way picked up on something shared it with me and I just watched I just sat and watched I couldn't make a decision because I didn't have enough information but I sat and watched and it ended up playing out perfect I've also seen her pick up on something and then be twisting in an emotional way because she got emotionally entangled in something and it not be exactly right is that right so we have to pay attention I can't say because my wife's more sensitive to me than whatever she says that's of the Lord we're going to do it no that's me giving over my headship that's me that's me actually not protecting her but if she knows she can express anything she feels to me and then I'm going to be prayerful and I'm going to take responsibility and I'm going away and I'm going to listen and I'm going to make the right decision now she's free to express but if I quickly say whatever you say whatever you say whatever you say what's she going to do she's going to get quiet because she doesn't want the responsibility of leading the family so I'm going to lose the opportunity to hear I'm going to lose the opportunity if I lay down my position and say you're right you're right you've been right the last 10 times so we're just going to go over you say from now on if we do that that woman with that gentle nature who doesn't want to be bold and doesn't want to be in charge she's going to regress and we're going to lose something but if we as husbands can stay in the right spot and say thank you for sharing that with me I don't know what to do but I'm going to be praying about this and she sees that you're listening and you're understanding even I mean I don't think there's any woman in here will admit that she's right 100 of the time nobody's right 100 of the time but there's something valuable to be expressed you see things that I can't see and if we share with one another and the man takes his position then the family will be better off I say thank God let's go to First Timothy chapter 3. First Timothy chapter 3 First Timothy chapter 3 verse 2. I'm sorry yeah verse two a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach so the bishop must be a husband of one wife let's go down here to First Timothy 3 12. let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children in their own houses well brother Ben comes to this scripture in verse 12. and the message placing of Deacons brother bam says somebody was presented to him by the Deacon board amen and he says now the scriptures requires a deacon to be married he's referring to this scripture and the man was disqualified because him and his wife weren't in harmony she wasn't a Believer she didn't believe the truth and and then you begin to look at what brother Bram said and you begin to look at the scriptures and begin to say why in order to hold a position of authority in the church as a bishop or as a deacon you have to be married you wonder why maybe because it will help maybe because what you need is a full picture of male and female maybe you need a greater understanding than you would have just as a single man but brother Branham said clearly he says the scriptures require a deacon to be a married man why because he's got to lead people he's got to help people Bishop has to lead people and help people and have a greater understanding and if everybody just LED from male perspectives male male male male male male male you would have I mean you would have a a group of rough Burly guys who are having a good time but nobody else will be having a good time nobody else would understand that we would lose a whole aspect of the nature of God I looked at the scripture and I said huh God knows what he's doing he knows what he's setting up and he knows why He's setting it up the way he is and God's way is the right way and so we see that the two becoming one gives the right expression the two in harmony the two in unity the two and each one playing the role correctly but the two together gives the right expression if we if we push one too far one way one expression the male or we push one too far the other way then we're not giving the right picture but when God can express himself through male and through female they can come together in unity according to the word they can come together in unity and mutual respect and love and care amen then they can begin to express because that's what Christ is doing with his bride in this day amen brother brim says in the message it is the rising of the Sun so but remember he went there with you and him see he's stung into Calvary God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same same word the same word spoke with the groom speaks of the Bride so there at Calvary he hadn't yet separated the bride from the bridegroom they were all one just like Adam was one it was all in Adam it was all in Christ amen there are Calvary hadn't separated it but God was going to separate it and God was going to separate it to give more expression and the message the restoration of the Bride tree he says but what he was God's perfect Prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory going to say something directly he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it from the Garden of Eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit he wanted another expression to express something else he wasn't just done he wanted to express more amen so the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he got to have a bride tree she's got to be born of the same material the word made flesh in the tree I hope you get it it's the same life in this female tree the bridegroom as it is in the bride The Works that I do show you also is that right he was the bridegroom remember now let's go back all the way to Genesis chapter 2. okay Genesis chapter 2 verse 22. in verse 22 in the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh in my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh all the way back in the beginning this was God's program that God would take the feminist out of the the man take the feminist nature out form it into another form and unite the two back together and in uniting them two back together he would have the expression that he was wanting and God now when he looked down at Calvary he saw Christ like he saw Adam in Christ was everything the fullness of the word but he was going to separate out the bride and the bride was going to come into manifestation because God wants the bride to be made manifest it's a manifestation he wants in this hour he says in the message Oneness says if you'll notice now that Eve was United with Adam she became part of him God did you notice in Genesis 1 27 he created man male and female created he them now both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then God took from his side a rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished God took from the side of Adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit it was original Adam's spirit the spirit was part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking both masculine and feminist now don't you see the great picture we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and Daughters not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined in wedlock to the Eternal see how God planned it that way should be not not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union offspring of the almighty done by the holy union now the body comes from mother and father but the spirit comes from God God separated himself as Adam was separated on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of the church God putting his self together then when that group of God together what does it do brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together what does that do when we come to the end time and we come to the spirit of God dwelling in full measure back in a bride upon the Earth it brings the unified body back together as one and that's what God wants to display in our day two becoming one amen he was here we were here but we didn't know anything about it now there comes an expression and down through seven Church ages there's come an expression of feminine of Bride and that bride expression comes to a culmination amen at the end time and to express Jesus Christ in the formation of the Bride it's a female expression and now when he comes as a headstone to cap this body to dwell in fullness in the body it's a unification of the body together now back together as one giving the right kind of expression in our time brother Brett says in the laodicean church age from the church age book it says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost by organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the method has failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in the last day there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age God will speak through his bride but she'll be the she'll be I love how he says this again another people in the land who under their messenger this bride will speak but never usurp Authority shall never rise above the headship of the word and she'll never rise above the messenger of the age that God gave to her she won't become equal to she won't use of authority but there's already been an expression and now there's another expression and this expression is under the messenger this bride amen now is is told as John was told to go take the book and eat the book she's taking the book and eating the book and told that you must prophesy again amen she's going to prophesy again but not her own prophecy not her own words not her own ideas prophesy again means prophesy what's already been prophesied prophesy again shall stay under the messenger for the age she'll stay under the headship of the word but she will be the final voice to the final age amen everybody expressing but staying in line to their calling under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age why will God do this because God wants to be expressed in the bride form he wants to he started it in Genesis it was disrupted by the Fall he's been working to bring it back and he wants it to be expressed and it'll be expressed in perfection in the millennium I'm looking forward to that time God never tells his bride to be quiet I'm tired of you talking but he says he says ask seek you should find knock God looks at his disciples Jesus is standing there with the disciples all around and he's saying the field is wide into Harvest pray to the Lord of the Harvest and he'll send laborers into the Harvest and brother Branham says he was the lord of the Harvest why would he knowing it's ready telling them it's ready ask them to pray he he could just take care of it and brother said he does nothing without man he's working through his body God has put himself on partnership with man God wants to express himself in all of these ways so he's got to have a people what he's expressing to the disciples he's got to have a people on Earth that'll voice back to him what they see needs done Lord look at the Harvest Lord send laborers to the Harvest he already knows but he's waiting for his bride to say something to him amen we've got to be seeing and praying and seeking and asking amen come like Abigail amen come come like like Moses did Moses comes to to God when he's standing in the Gap and he's reminding God of God's promise God doesn't say be quiet Moses I was the one who said it why are you reminding me of what I said no but it was Christ in Moses there was an expression that he was expressing and God was pleased that Moses was standing in the game expressing another part of God and he's telling God God don't do this your enemies will think this don't you remember the promise you made to Abraham amen and God listens to Moses was it he was he listening to Moses or was he listening to himself in Moses and then and and now I mean God's never told us to be quiet you have nothing to say just follow orders that's not that's not the bride the bride's the one on earth expressing she's his eyes and his ears and she's saying gone amen you promised this but look at my child look at this one look at this in the church God do you remember when you said do you remember when your Prophet said I'm trusting in you amen and God is listening to his wife speak back to him and he's saying that's good honey that's good yeah we'll do that because God wants us to ask God wanted the disciples Jesus wanted the disciples to ask although he already knew he wanted the nest he was depending on them getting into action so he could respond to their request I say the bride has an important role in the end time men she used to stand her headship absolutely I don't think she has a desire to get out of headship it's only deception that that tries to make us do that but the true bride has no desire to get out from headship she has no desire to be above the messenger of the age I don't know about you but I'm happy being under the messenger very content being under the messenger and very content having Christ watching over me so under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter revelation 22 verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come God is going to express himself in all of these Avenues and we should understand God's expression even in even in our families in the church all around us we could understand God wants to express himself male and female hey let's not be too proud as men when your wife has the best idea you've ever had on that subject it's happened to me multiple times and every time it's like oh yeah you're right but thank God Amen God's put somebody there to partner with you to help bail you out and give you another vision and give you more insight if we would take the right approach to the things have gone I think we would get the right benefit out of it praise God God was to express himself male and female and there is a great tremendous value in the expression of the feminine attribute of God and I say thank you I all the sisters who Express a Godly sweet gentle nature who are nurturing and loving respectful I said God bless you I can't express what God's called you to express I can express it in the spiritual as I express it back to God my headship but in the natural God's called me to a different role but all of you sisters who Express that God bless you be encouraged keep pressing on it's valuable your perspective is valuable your Insight is valuable amen because God wants to be expressed in male in female and God bless you let's all stand musicians if you'll come please and brother John if you'll come I pray that you have a wonderful Mother's Day I say if God gives you the opportunity to celebrate a mother be thankful celebrate tell her you appreciate her if it's your wife your mother amen if you had a Godly mother a Godly wife who's raising your children that's a precious thing friends we thank God for those things let's bow our heads together dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your word that you've given to us for the picture that you've painted Lord I pray that you'd help us Lord to each one fulfill the role that you've called us to in this life nor may we have respect for one another and understanding or God may we recognize that you're both masculine

understanding with greater Vision bringing us so far away from this natural world bringing us into an expression of your Eternal thoughts your Eternal desire what you wanted from before the foundation of the world and God that's what we want to express Lord we just pray that you would help us Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you brother John I'm resting on the finished word of Jesus
