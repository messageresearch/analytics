[0:26] her heart and she just she she didn't
[0:29] have reservations to speak it out amen
[0:31] when there was the word of the Lord when

[0:52] us have been or most of us have been
[0:54] amen when many times we come to church

[1:53] huge speech and then you know rebuking
[1:56] the deacons for not believing that amen
[1:58] she didn't do it don't just very very
[2:01] simple very subtle very quiet she would
[2:03] say there nothing but the truth amen
