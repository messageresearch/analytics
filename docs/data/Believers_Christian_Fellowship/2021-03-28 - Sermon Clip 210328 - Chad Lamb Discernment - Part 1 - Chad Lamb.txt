========================================

if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charged concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou shall dash thy foot against the stone oh i'm telling you friends that's a hard one that that is real bait right there amen taking the the very scriptures and jesus christ is the very manifestation of the word and the devil's using the very scriptures and what's he trying to do first he's doubting his identity and trying to lure jesus into having needing to prove his identity that's the same thing he did with eve back there and it says amen if you if god doesn't know that if you take this fruit then you'll be as gods and she was already as a god and jesus was already son of god but but the devil is putting a doubt he's saying if thou be the son of god amen and i wonder you have to ask yourself this question he said if thou be son of god cast myself down for the scripture says this it will be the fulfillment of the scripture i ask you if jesus would have thrown himself down and the angels would have caught him before he hit would the devil have turned into a believer and stopped asking questions would that have been his last question would that have been the evidence to prove that the devil needed to say yep you are the son of god if we would have done that then the next one would be another question well the other scripture says and another scripture says and another scripture said i tell you friends don't go down this road amen trying to prove your identity your identity comes through a new birth through a personal experience of you and jesus christ individuals together and you know that he come and he got you amen he called you well he brought you to himself and united himself with you that's your identification and nothing else amen that life then produces evidence of the life then there's workings that come out of that life amen but you cannot go amen to the workings amen to prove to yourself that you're son of god you've got to go back to the experience of meeting jesus christ personally yourself
