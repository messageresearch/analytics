[0:00] the whole purpose of elohim coming down
[0:03] in a body of flesh
[0:04] to perform the sign of the messiah was
[0:06] to get sarah to believe that she's the
[0:07] one
[0:08] and this word is true and the time is
[0:11] now
[0:12] and god has sent a prophet in our day
[0:14] and it was none other than
[0:16] god himself operating through that
[0:18] tabernacle of flesh
[0:19] with feet that could be washed and could
[0:21] eat amen it could converse with you and
[0:23] could walk down the road
[0:24] amen it was god tabernacled in a body of
[0:27] flesh
[0:27] and that flesh was his prophet william
[0:29] branham and he would turn his back to
[0:31] the crowd
[0:31] and begin to discern the thoughts of the
[0:33] people here and over here and in the
[0:35] balcony
[0:35] showing the sign of the messiah not to
[0:38] show off a sign
[0:39] not to show off the gift but to get to
[0:41] sarah to believe that it's you
[0:43] you're the one the promise is for you
[0:46] and the time is now
[0:48] why did you hear and see that sign why
[0:51] are you
[0:51] the one who got the tape and there's
[0:52] millions out there that didn't get the
[0:54] tape
[0:55] why are you the one who got to see
[0:57] prophet visit south africa
[0:58] read prophet fit to south africa why are
[1:00] you the one that got to see
[1:02] 20th century prophet and deep call it to
[1:04] the deed
[1:05] millions have seen it millions haven't
[1:07] seen it millions have seen and rejected
[1:09] it but something in you said
[1:11] that's the truth that's god a man can't
[1:14] do that that's god
[1:16] and it wasn't done so you can say that's
[1:18] god and i've seen god in flesh and god
[1:19] come in flesh but god come in flesh for
[1:21] a purpose
[1:22] and that purpose was to bring sarah's
[1:24] faith up a little bit higher
[1:27] because sarah was doubting because of
[1:30] her condition
[1:35] praise god i hope we can stop doubting
[1:38] because of our condition
[1:39] it has nothing to do with our condition
[1:41] god has already sent a word to change
[1:43] our condition
[1:44] he had already brought us from death
[1:45] unto life abraham's seed was dead
[1:48] sarah's wound was dead but in the
[1:50] visitation of elohim he was going to
[1:52] bring a resurrection
[1:54] from the dead and this is a resurrection
[1:57] ministry
[1:58] this is a resurrection hour it's the
[2:00] raising up of the word
[2:01] it's the raising up of the bride
[2:04] everything was dead when elohim came to
[2:07] them
[2:10] the word had been laying dead for years
[2:14] the seed word that was in abraham has
[2:16] been laying dead for years
[2:18] the bride was stuck in formalism and
[2:21] reasoning stuck in an
[2:23] old thinking in an old condition that i
[2:25] being old can't
[2:27] bring forth life
[2:32] everything was dead
[2:35] when elohim and flesh came on this earth
[2:40] and the purpose of elohim coming in
[2:42] flesh was to quicken them to life
[2:44] to bring them back to the condition
[2:46] where the seed can be given and the seed
[2:48] can be received
