========================================

now this messenger of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turned the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers you tell me what radio preacher you tell me what tv preacher can do that they can't do that they can't do that because they'll give up on the word they have to back off with a word to do that but the reason that brother branham could do this the reason god could purpose this for his life is because he knew he would not back up on the word and because he wouldn't back up in the word now god has a vessel that he can ordain with gifts to come and to fulfill these scriptures in malachi 4 in revelation 10 7. had brother brandon been somebody that would compromise on the word he would never be able to fulfill this position and i'll say it this way he says that's the reason god saved me was so that i could do this so that i could fulfill revelation 10 7 and malachi 4. that was the purpose god had in saving him and he says i am bound and determined to do that i am bound to determine to never deviate away from that word can we say the same thing can we say the same thing because remember it's the bride's position not to refulfill this as we talked about several weeks ago it's the bride's position to vindicate this ministry and you will never vindicate this ministry if you back up on the word you will never be able to vindicate malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 if you back up on the word and i'll say it this way god has no purpose in saving you if you will back up on the word it's pointless it's futile what purpose does he have in saving you if you would back up on the word none but because you wouldn't back up on the word that's why he saved you and you say well how did he know i wouldn't back up on the word because you didn't back up on the word before remember this is not the first time you have fought this battle you have resisted the devil's lie in heaven before and you have kicked him out i don't know how many times we fought this battle but i know that it's more than twice because we fought it there and we fought it in christ and we're fighting it now we didn't lose back there saints we didn't lose a calvary either what chance do you think you're going to lose now when you are a written bible you think the bible is going to fail not a chance not a chance but remember this all hinges on one thing you have to be called you have to be chosen and you have to be faithful you have got to make a choice you have got to get down with business with god and find out the purpose and the reason that he has saved you is not to walk around and say i'm a message believer and have no clue what the message even is it is your purpose to find out what the message is and then to walk into that and you can only do that through revelation by god himself
