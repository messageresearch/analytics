[0:00] this is not the nature we know she's not
[0:02] got the right nature anybody in the
[0:04] world knows jezebel's not the right
[0:05] nature but she she's displaying the
[0:08] nature of the false church amen amen and
[0:10] god has other women like esther
[0:12] displaying the nature of the true church
[0:14] and bride of jesus christ and when we
[0:16] look at these things it's more than just
[0:18] stories because we want to look at that
[0:20] and say if i ever start to need to
[0:22] manipulate a situation i'm already
[0:24] moving the wrong way
[0:26] if i have to become dishonest amen to
[0:28] push an agenda forward if i have to
[0:31] become politically motivated in the
[0:33] church amen instantly when i begin to do
[0:35] those things i'm now i'm now replicating
[0:38] the false vine and the false woman amen
[0:40] because all i need to do is humble
[0:42] myself under the word and approach my
[0:44] god with humility and sincerity and
[0:47] reverence to him and tell him my need
[0:49] and let him decide what needs to be done
[0:54] not go and tell him you need to do this
[0:56] and you need to do this and you need to
[0:57] do that esther never come and said do
[0:59] this do this do that she said i'm just
[1:01] asking for my life
[1:04] it was up the king and we know later as
[1:06] she progressed amen through there the
[1:08] king would say now what do you want
[1:12] esther never said i want this i want
[1:13] this i want this she never says doing
[1:16] and shush on the palace today as we did
[1:18] yesterday and hang the ten sons of haman
[1:20] she didn't do that of her own accord
[1:22] amen when the king looked at her and
[1:24] gave the report and says now what more
[1:25] would you want
[1:27] and she answered
[1:29] esther is always under headship esther
[1:32] is always submissive to the king the
[1:35] king she will not just demand but the
[1:37] king will ask and then she'll tell
[1:40] but jezebel's not under any headships
[1:42] she's taking headshift she's taking
[1:44] dominion she's become dominating
[1:47] esther's never becoming dominating
[1:50] but esther is not weak
[1:53] you can see esther is not passive amen
[1:56] because when he says what do you want
[1:57] done do today like we did yesterday and
[2:00] hang the tens on she's not weak she's
[2:02] not passive amen she knows what needs to
[2:04] be done amen and she knows amen where
[2:07] the evil is and how to correct it but
[2:09] she's not making demands and she's not
[2:11] making it happen
[2:14] see
[2:15] you can say these are stories in the
[2:16] bible but it comes down to our personal
[2:18] lives amen when we're trying to get
[2:21] something done in a workplace in a
[2:23] church environment and a family and we
[2:25] have to become manipulative and
[2:27] deceiving and political amen you're
[2:29] emulating the wrong character that's the
[2:31] nature of lucifer that has come down
[2:33] through canaan amen that has come down
[2:35] to jezebel
[2:40] but when we can go to god with reverence
[2:43] and humility and sincerity and say lord
[2:46] i know you're god and you construct all
[2:48] things and you ordain all things and i'm
[2:50] happy but lord there's a need that i
[2:52] have here there's a conflict there's a
[2:54] something going on i'm asking you lord
[2:56] just to help me
[2:58] i'm asking you to take care of it and
[3:00] then let god work it out amen let god do
[3:03] the thing
