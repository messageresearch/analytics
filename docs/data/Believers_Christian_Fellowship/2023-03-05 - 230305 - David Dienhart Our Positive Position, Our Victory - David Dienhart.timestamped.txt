[18:44] it's an individual affair
[18:47] praise be to God in the book of First
[18:50] John
[18:52] just read a scripture to hear and have
[18:55] you be seated first John 1 or first
[18:58] excuse me first John 5.
[19:03] and I'd like to read the fourth verse
[19:06] just to start here this morning
[19:10] let's read first verse with it
[19:13] whosoever believeth that Jesus is
[19:18] the Christ
[19:20] is born of God not was
[19:25] is
[19:27] present tense
[19:29] the Christ the anointed one the anointed
[19:32] word among us
[19:34] is born of God no man can call Jesus
[19:37] Lord except by the Holy Spirit did you
[19:39] know that
[19:40] except a man be taught of God he can't
[19:43] know
[19:45] the presence personally of God himself
[19:48] amen
[19:50] then the fourth verse for whatsoever is
[19:52] born of God
[19:54] overcometh the world
[19:56] and this is the victory
[20:00] that overcometh the world
[20:03] even our
[20:05] faith
[20:08] you may be seated faith
[20:11] is a revelation
[20:15] the prophet referring to Hebrews 1
[20:18] 11 1 he said faith is a revelation the
[20:22] scripture said faith is
[20:24] the substance
[20:27] of things hoped for
[20:28] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[20:32] amen faith is a revelation
[20:37] amen amen it's an actual substance it's
[20:40] something you know it's not something
[20:41] you imagined
[20:43] it's not something that is a myth
[20:46] it's something revealed to you that's as
[20:49] real as you see anything else or your
[20:51] senses would declarally it's it's
[20:53] another sense it's the Sixth Sense
[20:56] and it's faith
[20:57] amen and it is the evidence
[21:02] that what has promised you
[21:04] that you may not see yet in vision of
[21:07] your vision but yet you know you have it
[21:10] amen and it must come to pass
[21:15] amen
[21:17] then I'd like you to turn with me to
[21:19] Psalm 62.
[21:24] 2 Psalm 62 remember our Victory is our
[21:27] faith psalm 62.
[21:31] foreign
[21:32] with verse 1
[21:37] truly my soul wadeth upon God
[21:42] from him cometh my salvation
[21:46] he only is my rock
[21:51] and my salvation he is my defense
[21:54] I shall not be greatly moved notice here
[21:58] he's saying David's saying he only
[22:01] God himself not another person God
[22:05] himself he only is my rock let's go down
[22:09] here to the fifth verse my soul wait
[22:13] thou only upon God
[22:16] for my expectation is from him
[22:22] he only is my rock and my salvation
[22:28] he is my defense
[22:31] [Music]
[22:33] I shall not be moved
[22:38] you were just set out
[22:40] brother sister you bride you are planted
[22:43] you were predestinated
[22:46] by God through foreknowledge
[22:50] for knowledge he knew you
[22:55] amen he only is my rock
[23:00] and my salvation he is my defense I
[23:03] shall not be moved in God
[23:06] is my salvation
[23:09] my glory
[23:12] the rock of my strength and my refuge
[23:16] is in
[23:18] God
[23:21] trust in him at all times
[23:26] you people pour out your heart before
[23:28] him
[23:29] God is a refuge for us Sila
[23:33] and I want to jump down to the 11th
[23:35] verse God has spoken once twice have I
[23:37] heard this that power
[23:39] belongeth unto God
[23:43] I want to take this for a title our
[23:45] positive position
[23:47] our victory
[23:50] our positive position
[23:53] our victory
[23:55] and we're speaking on a subject of Bride
[23:59] material
[24:01] bride
[24:02] material is actual substance material
[24:06] means the substance in which a thing is
[24:08] made
[24:11] bride material or bride substance this
[24:15] bride material is the substance
[24:19] the revelation of God
[24:23] himself
[24:25] this bride substance this revelation of
[24:30] himself
[24:31] this little bride is himself revealed
[24:36] brother Branham said on the message
[24:37] Shalom two of them both in Phoenix and
[24:39] both in Watch Fort Huachuca Arizona
[24:42] he said
[24:44] notice David here speaking of The Rock
[24:48] he said Rock in the Bible means
[24:51] revelation
[24:52] and David is declaring God is my
[24:55] revelation
[24:57] Jesus said that I'll build my church
[24:59] upon the revelation
[25:01] of myself
[25:03] who I am
[25:05] he said I'll build my church and the
[25:06] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[25:08] it
[25:10] and Revelation faith is substance
[25:16] of the thing that God promised you you
[25:19] have the very substance of it because
[25:22] before and remember this and let's go I
[25:25] want to turn over here to Matthew very
[25:27] familiar scripture but you don't have to
[25:29] turn if you want I but I just Matthew 24
[25:31] 35 very familiar and it should be
[25:35] familiar back in 24 35 it said
[25:40] now I got to get to 24th verse not 20.
[25:44] okay it said Heaven and Earth
[25:46] shall pass away
[25:48] but my word
[25:50] shall not
[25:53] pass away
[25:54] what is the thought
[25:57] it's a word
[25:58] a thought has to be expressed a word
[26:01] excuse me what is a word it's a thought
[26:02] expressed
[26:04] what is the word what is God's word is
[26:07] this thought it had to be a thought
[26:09] first
[26:11] it had to be a thought first
[26:13] and that thought expressed is his word
[26:16] and Jesus is saying here heavens and
[26:18] earth will pass away but my word
[26:20] shall not pass away
[26:22] so it had to First be substance
[26:25] it had to be God's thought
[26:28] and God's thought what he thought
[26:31] wasn't a whim it wasn't imagination it
[26:33] was actual substance
[26:36] it was Faith even the prophet said that
[26:38] God created the worlds by faith
[26:41] he first had to think it he had it in
[26:43] his mind and then he expressed what he
[26:45] had in his mind and he created
[26:49] is that right
[26:51] by faith he said the scripture said in
[26:53] Hebrews 11 3 that by faith the worlds
[26:56] were created
[26:57] that things which are were not things
[26:59] made of which we see it was a spoken
[27:01] word it was a spoken thought
[27:04] amen
[27:07] and the revelation of the word
[27:11] is the thought behind that word it
[27:14] becomes substance to you and I
[27:17] that word becomes substance
[27:20] all right of the thing promised so you
[27:22] have the very substance of it
[27:25] all right so we we look at this
[27:29] and so we have the substance now man as
[27:33] I said and brother Branham said after
[27:34] quoting that scripture in Hebrew and
[27:36] excuse me in Matthew 24 35 he said and
[27:40] if you you any you here this morning
[27:44] and that not only speaks of a lamb
[27:46] female lamb but it also is you
[27:51] all right
[27:53] you if you be that word he said
[27:58] you will not pass away either
[28:02] so where were you before it become a
[28:04] word
[28:07] he said if you be that word then you had
[28:09] to be the thought first
[28:13] Hallelujah
[28:15] stimulation is coming on now
[28:19] you had to be the thought first
[28:22] all right so I want to bring the word
[28:25] substance in the Greek if you look at
[28:28] that scripture
[28:30] faith is the substance of things hope
[28:31] for the word substance means that which
[28:34] has actual existence
[28:40] amen that which has actual existence
[28:43] you have the substance of something you
[28:45] have you have what the word promised you
[28:48] you have that in existence that's why by
[28:51] faith you can walk forward by faith we
[28:54] live by faith by revelation
[28:58] amen
[29:00] or late I want to break into this
[29:02] there's a lot of things to go with here
[29:04] so you bear with me
[29:07] we're talking about bride material
[29:09] brother Branham made this statement over
[29:12] here in the scripture and I've got other
[29:13] scriptures to read here but he said
[29:17] in a in a message
[29:21] in perfect faith
[29:23] Jesus lived in a world that no one note
[29:25] about
[29:27] he was an odd person he lived in a world
[29:29] of perfect Faith now perfect faith is
[29:33] God's faith
[29:36] it's not an intellectual faith
[29:39] it's God's faith
[29:41] amen
[29:43] that's God's revelation that's why the
[29:45] scripture said David said he is my rock
[29:48] brother Brown I'm referring to that said
[29:50] David is saying that God is his
[29:52] revelation
[29:54] David's saying God is my revelation
[29:57] I can hide in that I'm hidden in God I'm
[30:00] I'm found in him he is my revelation
[30:05] he is then my substance
[30:10] Hallelujah
[30:11] he is my substance
[30:14] all right
[30:16] and so he goes on to say
[30:19] he lived an odd person he lived in a
[30:21] world of perfect faith in the in the
[30:23] perfect God in which he was
[30:29] he lived in a perfect faith of a
[30:31] Christian
[30:33] now you know what a Christian is not not
[30:35] the word Christian not nominal Christian
[30:37] means tabernacling very deity himself
[30:41] Christ like
[30:43] you can't be christ-like without Christ
[30:46] being in you
[30:49] you cannot be Christ's material God's
[30:51] material until God comes and lives in
[30:54] you
[30:59] so so we see here brother Branham also
[31:02] said that bride material he said it's
[31:04] the substance of God
[31:06] made word
[31:09] and expressed in what you are now
[31:14] it's the substance of God made word
[31:18] what is that substance it's thought made
[31:21] word
[31:24] and expressed in what you are now
[31:29] the substance of God would be the
[31:31] thought of God
[31:33] if you ever were a part of God you
[31:35] always were a part of God I'm going to
[31:37] come to this so I want to get ahead of
[31:38] myself here
[31:40] but I want to show you
[31:43] God wants to show you and establish who
[31:45] you are your positive position
[31:48] the prophet said in the in the message
[31:50] things that are to be he said oh God
[31:53] it's so good to see ourselves
[31:55] positionally placed
[31:58] in
[32:00] Jesus Christ
[32:02] it's so good to see ourselves
[32:04] positionally placed in Jesus Christ
[32:09] you then are his revelation
[32:13] it's not another person it's the same
[32:16] Christ
[32:18] brother Branham called with the same
[32:20] Jesus in The Bride form
[32:25] and there lays our victory
[32:28] is that revelation
[32:32] it's the same word
[32:35] it's the same power
[32:38] power belongeth unto God
[32:40] so it's not another Power it's the same
[32:42] power
[32:44] it's the same word
[32:46] a word has to be a thought before it's a
[32:48] word so it's the same thought
[32:53] Hallelujah
[32:55] not another
[33:14] just a moment here I'm wanting to locate
[33:16] oh yes
[33:27] I'm wanting to find here oh there there
[33:29] it is right in front of me okay
[33:32] Satan likes to hide things once in a
[33:34] while
[33:36] but God
[33:38] how many know that let this mind be in
[33:41] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[33:44] being in the form of God that form means
[33:46] in morphe
[33:48] who being in the form of God thought it
[33:50] not robbery to be equal with God
[33:54] all right and he said but let's let that
[33:56] mind be in you
[34:00] all right so he said so so what's that
[34:03] going to take what's that going to take
[34:04] to have that mind in you it's going to
[34:06] take a predestinated foreknowledge
[34:10] and that becomes in you
[34:14] amen it's God materializing himself
[34:20] in fact he said when he thought let me
[34:22] just drop this in into you here a little
[34:25] bit
[34:25] he said
[34:32] I have some notes I'm carrying over from
[34:34] other messages so if I look like I'm
[34:36] turning quite a little bit I am
[34:38] see God in the it's the same thing as
[34:40] moving a computer you know up and down
[34:47] I'm not I'm the old school
[34:50] so you need to really listen
[34:53] you're going to have to use one sense
[34:55] more than the other one and that's your
[34:57] ears
[34:58] you're hearing
[34:59] all right
[35:01] see God in the beginning when he thought
[35:03] of you and I'm going to just drop this
[35:05] in I'm going to God this is my this is
[35:07] my whole subject but watch this God in
[35:10] the beginning when he thought of you
[35:13] and thought of others like that
[35:16] thought of himself
[35:21] being tangible
[35:24] that was his thoughts see
[35:28] that was his thoughts
[35:31] what were those thoughts substance
[35:34] we're going to show this by what he said
[35:36] here in just a moment remember thought
[35:39] substance is something of that has
[35:41] actual existence
[35:43] it's real
[35:46] and he said he said he thought of you
[35:50] thought of others like that thought of
[35:51] himself of being tangible that was his
[35:53] thoughts see so he expressed his
[35:56] thoughts by word
[36:00] and he said let there be
[36:03] Let There Be and there was
[36:07] and then after a while the people said
[36:08] one day don't let God speak he said I'll
[36:10] I'll he said I'll speak to them through
[36:12] then through I'll speak to them then
[36:14] through a prophet
[36:17] and the prophet will say Let There Be
[36:20] and there was
[36:24] Hallelujah are you hearing
[36:27] all right
[36:29] so
[36:33] he said here he said
[36:39] God and morphe mask in a pillar of fire
[36:43] god amorphy
[36:45] in a man called Jesus
[36:48] stretching his tent
[36:51] same God
[36:53] taking on a mask
[36:56] God amorphe in his church
[37:02] amen
[37:04] God above us
[37:05] God With Us God in us
[37:09] the condescending of God now it's God in
[37:12] us the Holy Spirit not the third person
[37:15] the same person
[37:20] Hallelujah that's why I say I'm blood
[37:22] related to you
[37:25] not natural blood
[37:28] a deeper a lot deeper than that more
[37:30] real than natural is that's temporal
[37:34] but this eternal blood which had eternal
[37:36] life in it
[37:38] amen are you with me I'm talking about
[37:41] spiritual that blood that dropped on the
[37:43] ground soaked in the ground but that
[37:45] blood had life
[37:47] that was not the blood
[37:49] of a of of a Joseph it was the blood of
[37:52] God
[37:53] you're not saved by the blood of a man
[37:55] you're saved by the blood of God the
[37:57] prophet said amen
[37:59] all right
[38:01] so he said now it's God
[38:05] with us the same person
[38:17] this bride thus this bride
[38:22] is the literal spoken word seed bride
[38:29] and though she is feminine in
[38:31] designation she's also called the body
[38:33] of Christ and the prophet said she's the
[38:36] body of Christ then she's the Revelation
[38:38] she is the revelation of himself
[38:43] and he said it's very apparent that she
[38:46] ought to be called that for she was
[38:47] predestinated in him
[38:51] came from the same source
[38:58] came from the same source
[39:01] Eternal with him and is now manifesting
[39:04] God in a many-membered body whereas once
[39:08] God was manifested in one member Jesus
[39:10] our lord
[39:13] that's our head how many know that our
[39:16] head Jesus Christ
[39:18] even our Lord why in manifests in one
[39:21] member even our Lord Jesus Christ it's
[39:23] the Holy Spirit showing the same thing
[39:25] it did when it was embodied in the body
[39:28] of Jesus Christ
[39:29] now it's embodied in the body of his
[39:34] bride
[39:36] amen
[39:38] all right
[39:44] let's go to a scripture here
[39:48] let's take Ephesians just a moment
[39:51] Ephesians chapter 1.
[39:54] foreign
[40:06] familiar scripture again but you know
[40:08] the scriptures are read over and over
[40:10] again and one day it all of a sudden
[40:12] becomes substance
[40:14] I may know what I'm talking about
[40:16] it's right there it's real I never saw
[40:18] that before and yet I read it
[40:20] intellectually
[40:22] believed it
[40:24] till it dropped from here to here
[40:28] you truly hear with your heart
[40:31] amen
[40:32] Ephesians 1
[40:34] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of
[40:37] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[40:39] us with all spiritual blessings in
[40:42] Heavenly places in Christ
[40:48] according as you see in Heavenly places
[40:52] in Christ
[40:55] according as he hath chosen us
[40:59] in him
[41:02] now before the foundation of the world
[41:05] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[41:07] before him in love
[41:11] having predestinated us unto the
[41:14] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[41:16] himself
[41:19] according to the good pleasure of his
[41:22] will
[41:23] wasn't your will it's his will it's his
[41:27] achievement
[41:28] it's his doing it was his thought
[41:33] is that right all right
[41:35] said now verse 9 having made known unto
[41:38] us
[41:40] the mystery of his will his word the
[41:44] mystery of his word the mystery of his
[41:45] will according to the good pleasure
[41:48] which he hath purposed
[41:51] in himself
[41:53] he purposed it
[41:56] he purposed it in himself
[42:01] so before you existed he knew you
[42:06] he knew you before the world began he
[42:08] knew you
[42:09] that's why you can know him
[42:13] yeah
[42:15] because he knew you I can know him
[42:17] because he loved me I can love him
[42:21] but he had to love me first
[42:24] is that right for me to know I love him
[42:26] means that he loved me first
[42:29] and because and if I know him then he
[42:32] had to know me first he said that in
[42:35] Saint John 14 he said I know my sheep
[42:38] and am known of them
[42:43] amen is that right he said they know me
[42:46] because I know them
[42:50] Hallelujah
[42:51] all right
[42:56] now I want to go here and and share some
[43:00] things with you he said on the church
[43:01] age book
[43:03] before I do that
[43:05] how many believe that
[43:08] by what we're what we're going to just
[43:10] cover here is something that is
[43:13] shows you that as a Christian
[43:16] you always were you are identified with
[43:18] him
[43:20] what is our identification his life
[43:23] revealed in you
[43:27] himself revealed in you is the token
[43:32] amen token is his life and it identifies
[43:37] you it identifies that you always were
[43:39] in him you always were a part of him
[43:43] amen
[43:45] all right before we do that I want you
[43:47] to go to Jeremiah
[43:50] 29.
[43:53] 11.
[43:59] I may know we're in the bright age
[44:03] amen
[44:05] amen
[44:10] we turn the corner
[44:20] Hallelujah
[44:27] this is what he said about that
[44:29] let me just share this with you and
[44:32] that's what the Bible has been
[44:34] now he said it's the same God all the
[44:37] time changing form in morphe
[44:39] he said now it's God
[44:42] we know he spoke this now it's God and
[44:45] bride form he said so
[44:47] the and what is it
[44:50] what would it be the bride coming of
[44:53] Christ
[44:54] all right now he says and that's what
[44:58] the Bible has been
[45:00] it has been a work of God that's been
[45:02] covered up
[45:05] and it's been hid since the foundation
[45:07] of the world
[45:08] and its Sevenfold mystery
[45:11] opening of Seven Seals it's Sevenfold
[45:14] mystery and God promised in this day at
[45:19] the at the age of this laodicean church
[45:22] he would take the mask off of the whole
[45:24] thing
[45:26] and we could see it
[45:30] whose we could see it
[45:33] only the bride
[45:36] only in her
[45:37] he uncovered himself
[45:39] what'd he uncover himself in you but
[45:42] what he uncovered himself for so you
[45:44] could find and see himself in you
[45:47] so he could come in the union with you
[45:49] he had to unveil himself
[45:53] amen he unveiled he said the whole he
[45:56] said the whole uh the the promise he
[45:59] said and God promised notice this God
[46:02] promised in this day
[46:04] what is Faith the substance of things
[46:07] promised
[46:10] amen he said and God promised in this
[46:13] day at the age of the laodicean church
[46:16] he would take the mask off the whole
[46:18] thing and we could see it and what a
[46:20] glorious thing
[46:23] amen what a glorious View
[46:27] now to lay in his presence
[46:31] Union coming in uni pouring himself into
[46:33] her he said they are becoming one
[46:37] for the wedding supper
[46:39] amen
[46:42] all right so he taken the mask off of
[46:45] that and and in this hour unveiled the
[46:49] mystery
[46:50] where is the mystery to be unveiled
[46:53] the mystery was in the pyramid
[46:56] the mystery is in you
[46:59] amen the mystery was laying in you is
[47:02] still a hidden Mystery but when God
[47:04] unveiled himself you came face to face
[47:07] with him
[47:07] I want to read that in just a minute
[47:09] found in second Corinthians chapter 4.
[47:12] amen because this is what it is we now
[47:15] have this treasure
[47:18] in Earthen vessels not another person
[47:20] God himself God is my revelation
[47:27] amen
[47:28] God is your Revelation bride
[47:31] your position your identity lays in
[47:33] nothing else your identity is in him
[47:37] all right verse 11 of Jeremiah 29 for I
[47:40] know the thoughts
[47:44] for I know the thoughts
[47:47] that I think
[47:49] toward you
[47:51] saith the Lord
[47:53] thoughts of Peace you notice that's an
[47:55] individual that isn't a group I know the
[47:58] thoughts that I think toward you he's
[47:59] speaking to Israel yes as a nation but
[48:01] he's speaking to other bride here
[48:04] amen
[48:05] the prophet said he said the word the
[48:08] word that spoke of the group
[48:12] speaks of the Bride
[48:15] the same word the word that spoke of the
[48:18] groom speaks of the Bride
[48:21] for I know the thoughts that I think
[48:23] toward you saith the Lord thoughts of
[48:25] peace that shalom
[48:28] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[48:31] give you an expected end
[48:36] amen
[48:38] now
[48:40] he comes down here in in the church AIDS
[48:43] book and this is Page 163 paragraph 163
[48:46] and I'm I'm referring how many know that
[48:49] that there's a there's a the the older
[48:52] Church age book and then there's one
[48:53] that brother George had put out
[48:56] you know about that this number I'm
[48:58] giving you is the one that brother
[49:00] George had had put out that it's the
[49:03] same wording it's just a little bigger
[49:04] font and you understand different page
[49:06] number and it and and so on page 163
[49:10] number 163 says now according to the
[49:13] word of God the bride was chosen before
[49:16] the foundation of the world the choosing
[49:19] of the bride was purposed in himself
[49:23] all right
[49:25] and in Romans 9 11 it said that purpose
[49:28] of God that that the purpose of God
[49:31] according to election might stand
[49:34] what is election
[49:36] First Peter 1 2 said he elected by
[49:38] foreknowledge
[49:40] speaking to the elect he said by
[49:42] foreknowledge
[49:44] so he had a foreknowledge of you
[49:47] amen
[49:48] all right you were his thoughts and you
[49:51] had to be expressed I'm getting ahead of
[49:53] myself let me back up you can read it no
[49:55] other way you can't read it any other
[49:57] way the heart purpose the heart purpose
[50:02] the Eternal purpose
[50:06] the Eternal purpose
[50:08] of God was to take a bride of his own
[50:11] choosing this is the heart purpose
[50:15] this is the climb this is the purpose of
[50:18] God through the whole scripture we find
[50:20] a mystery of God that was still sealed
[50:22] up
[50:23] but couldn't be unveiled until this age
[50:27] the mystery of God the seventh Angel's
[50:30] message which prophet said is the
[50:32] seventh seal which is the Revelation 10
[50:34] message
[50:36] he said that he said that would unveil
[50:39] the and finish the mystery of God
[50:45] amen I hope you can come to yourself and
[50:48] realize you always were substance
[50:50] existing
[50:54] all right so now we come down here and
[50:57] he said he said here he says now he goes
[51:00] on he said it was purpose that purpose
[51:03] was in himself the heart purpose was the
[51:05] purpose in himself of being and being
[51:08] Eternal was decreed
[51:10] and being Eternal was decreed before the
[51:14] foundation of the world
[51:16] it was hard to decree
[51:19] God cannot change his mind
[51:24] Hallelujah he may permit you to do
[51:27] something but that doesn't change his
[51:29] mind
[51:31] and God's mind concerning you can't
[51:33] change
[51:38] all right so he said here
[51:41] he goes on to say watch carefully
[51:43] paragraph 164 page 164 he said watch
[51:47] carefully now and see this
[51:49] before there was ever a speck of
[51:50] Stardust before God was God God is an
[51:53] object of worship of adoration and no
[51:55] one was there to worship him so he was
[51:58] at that time only potentially God and he
[52:00] was known only as eternal spirit
[52:04] the bride was already in his mind
[52:11] I'm speaking to you hello bride was
[52:15] already in his mind
[52:20] the bride was already in his mind
[52:23] yes she was watch this
[52:26] existing she was existing in his
[52:31] thoughts
[52:32] what's the substance
[52:34] something of actual existence
[52:38] amen she was already existing in his
[52:41] thoughts
[52:44] and what about those thoughts of God
[52:46] Hold Up Wait A Minute back up here who
[52:49] are the thoughts of
[52:54] who are the thoughts of
[52:56] of God there's only one form of eternal
[52:59] life that's God himself creator of
[53:01] heavens and earth the author of life and
[53:04] The Giver of every good gift God Alone
[53:06] is eternal life
[53:08] and he had his bride in him as the
[53:11] thoughts of himself
[53:13] he said here is what about those
[53:15] thoughts of God they are Eternal are
[53:18] they not
[53:20] amen
[53:22] they are Eternal are they not he said
[53:25] the Eternal thoughts of God the Eternal
[53:27] thoughts of God let me ask you are the
[53:30] thoughts of God eternal
[53:32] if you can see this you will see many
[53:34] things
[53:36] God is unchangeable
[53:38] in both Essence and behavior we have
[53:41] studied that and proven that already God
[53:43] is infinite in his ability so therefore
[53:45] as he as God is omniscient he is
[53:49] omniscient then he is not now learning
[53:51] nor is he taking counsel even with
[53:53] himself nor is he at any time adding to
[53:55] his knowledge
[53:59] if he can add to his knowledge and he's
[54:01] not omniscient the best we could say
[54:02] that sometime he will be but that is not
[54:05] scriptural
[54:06] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[54:09] thought about anything
[54:12] Hallelujah
[54:14] he doesn't have a new thought about you
[54:19] amen what what was expressed in his word
[54:22] you were being expressed
[54:25] Christ was being expressed all that God
[54:28] was he poured into Christ all that
[54:30] Christ was is now poured in where
[54:32] poured in injected in it's a marriage
[54:35] brother sister it's a union all that God
[54:37] was he poured into Christ all that
[54:40] Christ was is poured in what is Christ
[54:42] it's the mystery of God revealed
[54:49] so Christ in you would be what the
[54:51] mystery of God revealed only the prophet
[54:54] said it would be the complete revelation
[55:00] amen what he thought about you he had
[55:03] hidden in himself he hid it in the word
[55:05] now we look in the word since he's
[55:07] unveiled himself and said oh there he is
[55:09] there she is there he is there she is
[55:11] why that's me
[55:16] amen this is me and this is what's this
[55:20] is what's coming to such a maturity what
[55:22] is it here's what the prophet said about
[55:24] it
[55:25] he said if Jesus lived in a world that
[55:28] no one knew about I started that quote
[55:30] and I didn't finish it if we he said he
[55:33] in the perfect faith in the perfect God
[55:35] of which he was if we lived in a perfect
[55:38] faith of a Christian to what we are
[55:42] we'd be a Mystic to the world
[55:45] the people wouldn't understand you you'd
[55:47] walk in the spirit
[55:50] what's the Bible say walk in the spirit
[55:51] and you'll not fulfill the lusts of the
[55:53] flesh is that right if you therefore
[55:56] walk in the spirit then if you live in
[55:58] the spirit also walk in the spirit
[56:01] there's your identity there's your
[56:02] Abiding Place there's Who You Are
[56:07] amen
[56:11] praise the Lord
[56:13] if we would walk in the in a perfect
[56:16] faith brother Brown said perfect Faith
[56:18] he said the exact quote he said perfect
[56:20] Faith he said is substance faith
[56:24] he said perfect Faith does not is not a
[56:27] intellectual Faith he said it's not a
[56:29] human faith it is God's faith
[56:33] and he said it's substance
[56:37] perfect faith is a substance faith for
[56:39] faith is a revelation the Revelation is
[56:43] a substance
[56:45] and the Revelation is the evidence and
[56:47] the revelation of the word in you is the
[56:49] evidence that you always were a part of
[56:50] him
[56:51] [Music]
[56:53] because it takes that it takes that word
[56:56] as in seed form that God planted in you
[56:59] he already planted it because he already
[57:01] decreed it and if he decreed it it
[57:03] become word and if it become word and
[57:05] now planted in you then he then the
[57:07] bride is the only one that could be
[57:08] reborn because in her is something that
[57:11] the Holy Ghost would come to himself
[57:13] himself coming to himself weren't coming
[57:15] two word that would Quicken that in you
[57:18] and what would it be it would be himself
[57:21] unveiled
[57:23] all right
[57:26] then where did you come from
[57:29] you were the actual existence
[57:33] you were his thought you were existing
[57:35] in his thought
[57:41] amen you talk about overwhelming when
[57:44] you realize that you realize you realize
[57:46] this word is my absolute
[57:49] this word is the ultimate I came from it
[57:52] I'm a part of it no wonder I can do
[57:54] nothing else but obey it I can do
[57:56] nothing else but no that's my absolute
[57:58] that's the amen that's the letting off
[58:00] of all pressure I don't care how bad it
[58:02] gets
[58:03] I was his thought expressed now in the
[58:07] being that I am
[58:09] I'm God's material
[58:12] amen I'm God I don't say that boastfully
[58:15] I say that by Grace I didn't have a
[58:17] thing to do with that God unveiled it
[58:19] himself it's God's achievement bride
[58:21] it's God's achievement you are in your
[58:24] position and positionally placed because
[58:25] it's God's achievement
[58:28] Prophet said I've come for one purpose
[58:30] he said I've come here to forerun that
[58:32] coming word
[58:34] I've come here to forerun it he said
[58:36] he's not coming for Methodist Baptist
[58:39] Presbyterian or Pentecostals he's coming
[58:41] for the bride Jesus Christ
[58:44] that's a direct quote I've got it right
[58:46] here in front of me let me say it again
[58:47] he said he's coming for the bride how
[58:49] many believe he's coming
[58:50] [Music]
[58:53] that's not what I was that's an I am to
[58:55] a body change
[58:59] we have is coming I know that's beat
[59:02] down and broken down and everything
[59:03] because people don't understand it
[59:04] because it's only made known to her
[59:08] that's the mystery of our message that's
[59:11] the secret you're the secret
[59:13] unveiled
[59:15] it wasn't unveiled out here in the
[59:17] public it's unveiled in you
[59:21] Hallelujah
[59:24] amen so he's coming he said he's coming
[59:27] I'll say this real slow
[59:30] he's coming for the bride Jesus Christ
[59:37] that's who he's coming for
[59:41] now you say well Brother David you I'm
[59:43] not making Brother David Jesus Christ
[59:45] but this unveiled word in me is who I am
[59:50] while you make yourself God to people
[59:52] brother Brown to people he says well
[59:54] that's enough star far off the truth is
[59:56] it brother
[59:59] he said why he said in one side a.m the
[1:00:01] others he said he was just on the wrong
[1:00:03] side trying to find him
[1:00:07] he's out on the other side of the flesh
[1:00:10] but this man inside man we're talking
[1:00:12] about is this unveiled word and his name
[1:00:14] is Jesus Christ and that's my name
[1:00:17] I'm married to him
[1:00:19] this Union is taking us to a body change
[1:00:22] brother sister this Union this Union
[1:00:25] we're not we're we're not looking at
[1:00:27] another we're looking at himself in
[1:00:29] Bride form

[1:00:34] expressing he was expressing it decreed
[1:00:37] you he already became Christ you realize
[1:00:39] he's already become Christ and Christ is
[1:00:41] now in you the mystery of God revealed
[1:00:44] is in you you're the final mystery makes

[1:01:00] I never say another word here that's
[1:01:01] amen and go home
[1:01:04] that's the truth
[1:01:06] because that's the whole message
[1:01:09] the bride grows up into the form of what
[1:01:12] she was meant to grow up into himself
[1:01:14] comes right up into the into the
[1:01:16] headstone himself
[1:01:18] perfected in him himself
[1:01:22] we've received a message of maturity
[1:01:24] we're laying in the presence of that
[1:01:26] message we are that message we are
[1:01:30] Eternal I just said we're existing in
[1:01:32] eternal life those thoughts of God is

[1:01:46] Eternal and you were existing in the
[1:01:48] very thoughts of God
[1:01:50] and they are eternal
[1:01:53] amen then I am

[1:01:58] this
[1:02:01] is expressed through this
[1:02:06] walking in you living in you living
[1:02:09] through you
[1:02:11] Brian let a bride get a hold of that she
[1:02:13] won't try to be puffed up about nothing
[1:02:15] she realizes what she possesses
[1:02:18] did Jesus walk puffed up let this mind
[1:02:20] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:02:22] who made himself of no reputation

[1:02:31] what he was he knew he was that word
[1:02:34] what about you
[1:02:36] do you know you're that word

[1:02:54] body you bypass it you know you came
[1:02:57] directly from the thought Hallelujah you
[1:03:00] came directly from the thought of God
[1:03:02] and God's revealing his sought to you
[1:03:03] and showed you who you were so he could
[1:03:06] take you back to what you bypass
[1:03:09] and then pick up from there you pick up
[1:03:11] a glorified body
[1:03:13] amen is that right Jesus went to hell he
[1:03:16] came back and picked up the body and
[1:03:18] came forth glorified
[1:03:22] amen are you with me if this body'd be
[1:03:25] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:03:27] waiting
[1:03:29] Jesus didn't bypass that he came
[1:03:31] directly he was Melchizedek before he
[1:03:34] became flesh
[1:03:36] is that right he was the theophany he
[1:03:39] knew all things we bypassed that and
[1:03:41] came directly from the thought
[1:03:44] but this is what's taken us back to
[1:03:46] where we were amen and he's redeeming
[1:03:49] what is God redeeming he is redeeming
[1:03:52] his thoughts his thoughts are redeemable

[1:04:29] attention to that if you have that
[1:04:31] desire in your heart to do it you need
[1:04:32] Calvary
[1:04:33] you have no desire to do that God's not
[1:04:35] judging you by your outward anymore by
[1:04:37] your flesh he's judging you by the what
[1:04:40] he sees through the blood
[1:04:42] you're judgment you've already taken
[1:04:44] judgment in him
[1:04:48] there's no condemnation to the bride
[1:04:49] she's not going to be at the white
[1:04:51] Throne being judged
[1:04:52] she's going to be judging the by the
[1:04:55] word
[1:04:56] amen where is God today he's in Bride
[1:05:00] form where is he where is Jesus Christ
[1:05:04] he's in the bride form
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:10] not another person himself and what is
[1:05:13] that for for the meeting in the air
[1:05:16] we've got to come to that Revelation or
[1:05:18] the manifestation of we've got to come
[1:05:20] to that substance that substance has got
[1:05:22] to be real in you the rapture's got to
[1:05:24] become substance in you
[1:05:28] everything we have need of in this
[1:05:30] journey
[1:05:31] is already given to us it's already
[1:05:33] provided for us God will reveal it when
[1:05:35] we have need of it but everything we
[1:05:37] need is already there even including the
[1:05:40] rapture
[1:05:44] hallelujah it's already in you
[1:05:48] working
[1:05:50] taking you to a body change
[1:05:53] we already see it as substance we come
[1:05:55] to that substance there's no question
[1:05:57] I'm there I'm already there I was
[1:05:59] already in God's thoughts to be there
[1:06:06] I'm not yelling at you
[1:06:10] it can't be anything different than I am
[1:06:11] though I may Roar a little loud but my
[1:06:14] middle name means lion-like
[1:06:18] Leon
[1:06:20] I guess if he Roars the roar isn't going
[1:06:23] to hurt you
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:29] Hallelujah I'm gonna talk real sweet and
[1:06:32] you know some yell
[1:06:36] but I don't care about that as long as I
[1:06:38] know him
[1:06:39] and if I know him I love him and if I
[1:06:42] love him I have to love you I will love
[1:06:45] you and I do
[1:06:46] love you
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] I'm just so glad that he can unveil
[1:06:52] where I was to begin with
[1:06:55] that says if I know where I come from
[1:06:57] then I know where I'm going
[1:06:59] if I know where I come from I know who I
[1:07:01] am
[1:07:04] that's right job said where were you
[1:07:08] where were you when I when I on when
[1:07:11] when I the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:07:14] where were you job where were you stand
[1:07:16] up like Amanda answer me where were you
[1:07:21] my Lord
[1:07:24] where were you you were in my thought
[1:07:28] shouting for joy
[1:07:32] you were there you actually existed
[1:07:34] there now watch what the prophet goes on
[1:07:36] to say
[1:07:40] he goes on to say this
[1:07:45] what did I do with my
[1:07:47] handkerchief
[1:07:50] all right
[1:07:56] he is omniscient he can never change
[1:07:58] have a new thought about anything
[1:07:59] because all of his thoughts has always
[1:08:00] been has he has always had and always
[1:08:03] will have he knows the end from the
[1:08:05] beginning
[1:08:06] because he said thus the because excuse
[1:08:09] me because he is God
[1:08:11] thus the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:08:14] they are
[1:08:16] real
[1:08:21] what's real the things we look at and
[1:08:23] see are the things that are unseen
[1:08:29] if what we if we look at the things
[1:08:31] which are seen they're what
[1:08:33] temporal
[1:08:36] if we look at the things our focus is on
[1:08:38] the Unseen what is the Unseen
[1:08:40] it's greater than the scene because the
[1:08:42] Unseen is eternal
[1:08:45] that's real
[1:08:48] and brother Brown used the term who's
[1:08:49] the real you
[1:08:55] the real you is the spirit of God in you
[1:08:58] things that are to be 1965 he said the
[1:09:01] real you
[1:09:03] is the spirit of God in you
[1:09:07] amen this is an old coat you wear but
[1:09:09] the real you is the Inside Man
[1:09:12] that's the real
[1:09:14] that's what you focus on
[1:09:17] where's my headship in me
[1:09:20] where's my guide in me
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:26] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:09:28] I'll be with you even in you
[1:09:31] I'm getting into another message all
[1:09:32] right
[1:09:35] then his thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:09:37] they are real they exist they are not
[1:09:39] simply like a man with a blueprint has
[1:09:41] drawn up in which one day will have
[1:09:43] translated into substance and form they
[1:09:45] are already real
[1:09:48] they are already substance they are
[1:09:50] already real and eternal and part of God
[1:09:57] amen Psalm 139 declares this my
[1:10:01] substance verse 15 my substance was not
[1:10:04] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[1:10:06] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[1:10:08] parts of the earth my substance was not
[1:10:11] hid
[1:10:13] from thee Thine Eyes did see my
[1:10:16] substance
[1:10:18] what is that substance we're not talking
[1:10:19] about a natural failing substance we're
[1:10:22] talking about an eternal spiritual
[1:10:23] substance
[1:10:26] a spiritual thought manifested in word
[1:10:28] which is what God's seed
[1:10:31] amen and God quickened that seed amen
[1:10:34] expressed it
[1:10:36] come down here and Prophet said let
[1:10:38] there be let there be and you were
[1:10:40] birthed under that word
[1:10:42] why you always were that word God's
[1:10:45] thoughts were expressed
[1:10:47] amen the message is God's thoughts
[1:10:50] expressed concerning you
[1:10:56] makes you the message
[1:11:01] makes you the message you're the message
[1:11:04] you're the message living you are the
[1:11:06] word living the prophet said the bride
[1:11:08] would be the word living and in action
[1:11:10] in other words she's the word she's
[1:11:13] living and operative
[1:11:15] Hebrews 4 12 the word is sharper than
[1:11:18] any two-edges sword living that's a
[1:11:20] Greek translation but Greek is living
[1:11:23] and operative
[1:11:25] a discerner
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:30] amen all right so he said
[1:11:33] he said he said this is then brother
[1:11:35] Brandon before he was reading that
[1:11:37] Psalms 139 he said God always had his
[1:11:41] thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts
[1:11:44] was yet unexpressed as his thoughts were
[1:11:47] yet unexpressed
[1:11:48] and so he goes to Psalm 139 he read the
[1:11:51] scripture I just read to you Thine Eyes
[1:11:54] did see my substance yet unperfect and
[1:11:57] in thy book were all my members written
[1:11:59] see your name was already already
[1:12:02] written already decreed
[1:12:05] in the book of eternal life
[1:12:10] is you know that that book of eternal
[1:12:12] life is a section of the Book of Life
[1:12:14] and it's the bride section
[1:12:17] how many's read that in the church age
[1:12:19] book that bride section it's a section
[1:12:22] of that book
[1:12:23] amen many names on The Book of Life but
[1:12:26] there's a bride record
[1:12:28] there's a bride section
[1:12:30] there's an eternal life record whose
[1:12:33] names could never be removed from that
[1:12:34] because they are the names of his bride
[1:12:37] and he said he put those names on the
[1:12:39] book of life before the foundation of
[1:12:41] the world
[1:12:43] Hallelujah
[1:12:46] I'm redeemed
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:52] that's right he redeemed his thoughts
[1:12:54] did you know that his thoughts are the
[1:12:56] Christian of today
[1:12:58] his thoughts are the Christian of today
[1:13:02] I don't have time to read all this I'm
[1:13:04] just quoting it to you his thoughts are
[1:13:06] the Christian of today
[1:13:09] any Christians here
[1:13:13] this is pretty stimulating I'm not
[1:13:15] asking you to shout and dance but it's
[1:13:17] stimulating
[1:13:18] it'll stimulate the interaction
[1:13:20] it'll put the word in your grip
[1:13:24] when that word's revealed to you and you
[1:13:26] I'll let me get I'll get that in just a
[1:13:28] moment
[1:13:30] so
[1:13:31] he said if you would walk in the spirit
[1:13:33] what this if you he said
[1:13:36] the world wouldn't understand you you'd
[1:13:38] walk in the spirit what the spirit said
[1:13:39] you would do what it forbid you would
[1:13:41] not do then then the people began to say
[1:13:44] why you'd they'll think you're a Mystic
[1:13:47] person to them that's the way it is with
[1:13:50] all believers
[1:13:53] so cheer up
[1:13:56] cheer up that's the way it is with all
[1:13:59] believers
[1:14:02] why are you trying to live or stand by
[1:14:04] what somebody else thinks about you
[1:14:07] either this has become substance in your
[1:14:11] life or it isn't and if it isn't keep
[1:14:14] keep reading keep drawing don't run from
[1:14:16] his presence run into it
[1:14:18] keep feeding on the open book keep
[1:14:20] feeding on on where you're recorded what
[1:14:23] God said about you and let God reveal
[1:14:25] his substance of his thoughts to you
[1:14:31] amen
[1:14:34] there's no reason we're not out here to
[1:14:35] make a show we're up here for doing one
[1:14:37] thing our Lord is our head

[1:14:42] so let me wait at his door in prayer let
[1:14:45] me let me just wait let me wait at this

[1:15:36] that and we're doing that for a purpose

[1:17:52] trials and everything it's taking you
[1:17:54] through it
[1:17:55] bringing you in through it out of it I
[1:17:57] came through all kinds of struggles to
[1:17:59] get here
[1:18:01] Satan doesn't want you to know what God
[1:18:03] thinks about you
[1:18:06] because what he thinks about you and put
[1:18:08] in the word is your absolute
[1:18:11] it's your ultimate
[1:18:14] amen and he knows as long as you stay
[1:18:16] behind that word there's not one thing
[1:18:18] he can do with you
[1:18:20] oh he'll try but he can't do it
[1:18:23] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:18:25] word and if you be that word my word
[1:18:27] shall never pass away
[1:18:30] you're that thought behind that word he
[1:18:32] put it in Word
[1:18:33] amen
[1:18:35] that's why you've got to feed on it
[1:18:36] that's why you've got to stay in it
[1:18:38] that's why you've got to you've got to
[1:18:39] continue to feed upon it
[1:18:41] take time redeem the time don't you get
[1:18:44] so busy to miss the rapture
[1:18:48] take time with God
[1:18:51] amen you've got to take time
[1:18:53] ask God to reveal it to you
[1:18:56] when things don't go just right put God
[1:18:57] before you amen
[1:19:00] all right
[1:19:02] so when a man lives by faith
[1:19:07] and walks by faith I mean substance
[1:19:11] faith
[1:19:12] brother Branham I'm quoting here I mean
[1:19:15] substance face he he is isolated from
[1:19:18] the entire world
[1:19:20] and becomes a new creature in Christ
[1:19:22] what is that new creature a spoken word
[1:19:25] creation
[1:19:29] let's turn to Second Corinthians just a
[1:19:31] minute
[1:19:34] second Corinthians
[1:19:36] chapter four
[1:19:42] and let's look at this new creation
[1:19:45] see what God did here
[1:19:53] the Bible said here in chapter 3 that
[1:19:56] when when your heart was turned to the
[1:19:58] Lord
[1:19:59] the veil was taken away
[1:20:03] that's the 15th verse of chapter 3.
[1:20:12] no I'm 16th of her excuse me I'll just
[1:20:15] read it nevertheless when the shall turn
[1:20:17] to the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:20:19] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:20:22] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:20:24] Liberty
[1:20:26] but we all with open face that open
[1:20:28] means unveiled face
[1:20:31] whose face is unveiled
[1:20:35] if the veil is removed whose face do you
[1:20:38] see
[1:20:42] now the Lord is that Spirit now we all
[1:20:45] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:20:47] it's a mirror
[1:20:50] beholding is in a glass the glory of the
[1:20:53] Lord
[1:20:55] brother Bradham said who is the glory of
[1:20:57] the Lord It's Jesus Christ
[1:21:01] but you're looking in the mirror and you
[1:21:03] with all with open face are not looking
[1:21:05] in that mirror and you're seeing the
[1:21:07] glory of the Lord and Prophet said then
[1:21:09] who are you seeing he said you're seeing
[1:21:11] yourself
[1:21:15] he said beholding is the glass the glory
[1:21:18] of the Lord are changed
[1:21:21] see a Rapture has already begun
[1:21:23] our change into the same image from
[1:21:27] glory to glory from Revelation to
[1:21:30] revelation
[1:21:34] even as by the spirit who's doing it the
[1:21:37] spirit of the Lord
[1:21:39] then the fourth verse said seeing we
[1:21:41] have this ministry
[1:21:45] what Ministry the ministry of the
[1:21:47] unveiling of himself the ministry of the
[1:21:49] unveiled Christ seeing we have this
[1:21:51] ministry
[1:21:56] the unveiling of who we are seeing we
[1:21:58] have this ministry seeing we have this
[1:22:00] message
[1:22:02] amen he said as we have received Mercy
[1:22:05] we faint not
[1:22:07] then it goes down here and if our gospel
[1:22:10] is his hid to them that are lost
[1:22:13] and then who blinds him as a God of this
[1:22:15] world then it comes down here to the
[1:22:17] fifth verse for we preach not ourselves
[1:22:19] but Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:22:23] we preach Christ the lord see what is
[1:22:27] the mystery it's Christ in you
[1:22:29] what's the mystery revealed it's Christ
[1:22:31] in you
[1:22:33] what is the Glorious Riches of this
[1:22:35] mystery among the Gentiles is Christ in
[1:22:38] you
[1:22:41] right
[1:22:44] then we preach not ourselves but Christ
[1:22:46] Jesus the Lord and ourselves your
[1:22:48] servants vessels for Jesus sake for God
[1:22:51] now this is what I get into here it is
[1:22:53] watch for God who commanded
[1:22:57] the light to shine out of Darkness hath
[1:23:00] shined where
[1:23:03] in our hearts
[1:23:05] has shined in our hearts to give what is
[1:23:08] he doing there he said he said in Isaiah
[1:23:11] 60 thy light is come
[1:23:15] is that right arise Shine for thy light
[1:23:20] thy light hello is there any lies here
[1:23:24] you
[1:23:26] for thy light has come and the glory of
[1:23:30] the Lord has risen upon you
[1:23:34] I preached I think that one more other
[1:23:36] time he'll not share that Glory with
[1:23:38] another
[1:23:39] he'll not share his glory with another
[1:23:40] but bride you're not another
[1:23:45] you are him
[1:23:48] the Bible over and over again father may
[1:23:51] they have my glory may they receive my
[1:23:53] glory may they have my glory may my
[1:23:55] glory be upon them Jesus said that in
[1:23:57] Saint John 17.
[1:23:59] you're looking into the mirror seeing
[1:24:01] his glory who is it you
[1:24:06] that's another message
[1:24:08] but that's the message
[1:24:10] that is the message
[1:24:12] you are his thought
[1:24:15] amen revealed
[1:24:18] unveiled
[1:24:19] you always were his thought he had no
[1:24:21] other thought about you
[1:24:23] his thought about you was the revelation
[1:24:25] of himself
[1:24:28] when he thought about you he thought
[1:24:29] about being material he became material
[1:24:31] he wanted to become material
[1:24:35] oh my the devil's distorted everywhere
[1:24:38] we turned didn't he
[1:24:40] he can't resist this because when this
[1:24:43] is in you it's a substance
[1:24:46] and you've got a word to come back is
[1:24:48] that I've got your answer Satan I've got
[1:24:51] your answer you're howling so loud
[1:24:53] because I have your answer this bride
[1:24:55] has your answer your or her answer is
[1:24:58] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:25:01] today and forever that's her answer it's
[1:25:04] not her living anymore it's not me
[1:25:06] living anymore it's him living in me
[1:25:10] not my life it's his life
[1:25:14] The Head and the body brother Brown said
[1:25:16] have become one unit
[1:25:21] amen
[1:25:23] hallelujah amen amen means so be it
[1:25:30] amen now
[1:25:33] so he spoke of Adam there being he said
[1:25:36] my substance yet being unperfect in my
[1:25:38] in thy book were all my members written
[1:25:41] which in continuance were fashioned as
[1:25:44] yet there was none of them
[1:25:47] so brother Brown said this he said that
[1:25:49] was not written about Adam without him
[1:25:51] name there but it gives you the idea
[1:25:53] knowledge that he that the thought that
[1:25:55] was in his there in his mind and that
[1:25:58] thought was eternal and it had to be
[1:26:00] expressed
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:05] can you see yourself
[1:26:08] eternal
[1:26:12] that's who you are
[1:26:15] that's who you are
[1:26:17] you come down here you bypass your
[1:26:19] theophany to come down here in this
[1:26:21] flesh man to be tried and tested
[1:26:26] God wanted to become known
[1:26:29] so he used tests and trials and
[1:26:31] struggles and to make himself
[1:26:33] to unveil himself through a law of
[1:26:36] contrast
[1:26:37] amen here I am inside of me eternal life
[1:26:41] here I am the outside warring against me
[1:26:45] my enemy
[1:26:47] but who's going to win
[1:26:50] who's I should say who has won
[1:26:57] the Eternal thought of God expressed in
[1:27:00] a word and revealed in me has already
[1:27:02] won
[1:27:05] expressed in you
[1:27:07] amen has already won the battle it's
[1:27:09] already finished the battle's the Lord's
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:15] amen all right
[1:27:18] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:27:21] by faith I mean substance Faith he is
[1:27:23] isolated from the entire world and
[1:27:25] becomes a new creature in Christ now
[1:27:27] just let me finish that scripture for
[1:27:29] God who commanded the light to shine out
[1:27:31] of Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:27:33] give the glow light to give the light
[1:27:35] thy light has come what's the light
[1:27:37] shining upon to give the light of the
[1:27:39] knowledge
[1:27:41] of the glory of God
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:48] what am I looking at here I'm looking at
[1:27:52] a new birth
[1:27:55] amen I'm looking at a birth word he said
[1:27:58] he comes in and what's that do it just
[1:28:01] continues to grow it grows into maturity
[1:28:03] it grows into the stature of what it is
[1:28:07] what's your stature Christ is your
[1:28:10] stature
[1:28:11] what's your identification Christ is
[1:28:13] your identification
[1:28:16] amen who are you Christ is who you are
[1:28:21] amen amen amen
[1:28:24] Satan does not want the bride and she's
[1:28:27] got to receive this it's got to be
[1:28:28] manifest because that's her
[1:28:31] that is who she is
[1:28:34] and when you know who you are then you
[1:28:36] have an expected end
[1:28:40] Hallelujah
[1:28:43] when you know where you came from know
[1:28:45] who you are you know I mean know where
[1:28:47] you came from you know who you are and
[1:28:49] if you know where you came from and who
[1:28:51] you are then you know where you're going
[1:28:53] it's already promised it's yours it's
[1:28:57] already given to you
[1:28:59] a position is something you've been put
[1:29:01] in place you didn't put yourself there
[1:29:03] he put yourself there
[1:29:05] he put himself there he puts himself as
[1:29:08] yourself
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:13] now I'm not going to get anywhere near
[1:29:15] but I'm just waiting to see Lord how
[1:29:17] much of this to bring
[1:29:19] but I want the main subject to come out
[1:29:21] you are his thoughts you are the very
[1:29:24] substance that he's spoken to existence
[1:29:27] when that Revelation comes in you you
[1:29:29] know one thing you have a body waiting
[1:29:31] for you
[1:29:33] amen you know you've got to come to a
[1:29:35] glorified condition he said those that
[1:29:37] he called he foreknew he called and
[1:29:39] those that he called he's already
[1:29:40] glorified
[1:29:41] is that right already already
[1:29:46] well God surely will change his mind by
[1:29:48] all the things I've done that's wrong
[1:29:50] did you want to do those things
[1:29:52] have you ever met him have you met him
[1:29:54] have you met face to face with Jesus
[1:29:57] Christ in you which is that sixth verse
[1:30:01] watch this he said he said to give the
[1:30:04] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:30:06] face
[1:30:07] of Jesus Christ
[1:30:10] or in the person listen
[1:30:13] to know him as life
[1:30:16] is that right to know him brother Brian
[1:30:19] said not to know his Bible not to know
[1:30:20] his letter but to know him we're not
[1:30:22] Ministers of the letter we're Ministers
[1:30:24] of the spirit
[1:30:25] we're Ministers of the thought that's
[1:30:27] behind that letter
[1:30:30] amen that's what God's unveiled that's
[1:30:32] never Satan never been able to grip that
[1:30:34] thought see he knows that word is God's
[1:30:36] word but he's not a part of that thought
[1:30:41] Hallelujah
[1:30:42] I'm talking about his eternal thought of
[1:30:45] himself
[1:30:46] God expressed it in the word the prophet
[1:30:48] brought it out the Seven Seals unveiled
[1:30:50] and took the veils the seals off of your
[1:30:52] life
[1:30:55] he unsealed your life
[1:31:00] that's what the seals were all about to
[1:31:02] show the bride who she was in the
[1:31:04] beginning what she would be here at the
[1:31:05] end and who she was all along that's
[1:31:07] what the seals were all about
[1:31:10] amen and when he unveils himself he
[1:31:12] comes into private he comes into Union
[1:31:14] with you nobody else sees that unveiling
[1:31:17] nobody else should see that unveiling
[1:31:19] it's only made known to her
[1:31:24] not a public show
[1:31:27] not known to the public you say well
[1:31:28] what's public everybody but bride
[1:31:33] I I don't know who bride is I'm not
[1:31:36] saying you are you aren't I'm just
[1:31:37] saying everybody but bride is
[1:31:42] public
[1:31:45] this can't be known to the public
[1:31:47] the only one going in the Rapture going
[1:31:49] into body change a meeting in the air is
[1:31:51] going to be the bride not only of this
[1:31:52] age of other ages but the whole thing
[1:31:54] without us it can't be made perfect
[1:31:57] we have the perfect interpretation of
[1:32:00] the word by Divine vindication
[1:32:06] you can't add to what that Prophet said
[1:32:08] you can't take away don't put your
[1:32:09] opinion on it
[1:32:13] amen it's not your opinion
[1:32:16] a man your opinion doesn't stand it's
[1:32:19] it's his opinion he already thought what
[1:32:20] he thought of you just grip a hold of
[1:32:22] what he thought and walk in that spirit
[1:32:25] because we have the Bible said the 13th
[1:32:27] verse of that same chapter I'm reading
[1:32:29] here second Corinthians 4 said we have
[1:32:31] we having the same Spirit of faith
[1:32:36] therefore speak
[1:32:38] it just and I'm bypassing some of that
[1:32:41] because I want to bring that up in
[1:32:42] another message but but we've gone
[1:32:45] through this we go through that we go
[1:32:46] through this we go through that but
[1:32:47] having the same Spirit of faith
[1:32:50] so we look not at the things which are
[1:32:53] seen but the things which are not seen
[1:32:56] for the things which are seen are
[1:32:58] temporal
[1:33:00] you're not identified by your temporal
[1:33:02] you're not identified by your mistakes
[1:33:04] you're not identified you are identified
[1:33:07] in Christ from the found before the
[1:33:09] foundation of the world you are
[1:33:11] identified already in God as his
[1:33:13] substance you are the very Revelation
[1:33:16] and substance of God yourself
[1:33:21] glory to God talk about a peace talk
[1:33:25] about arrest anybody entered into that
[1:33:27] rest
[1:33:29] then you've ceased from your own labors
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:35] Hallelujah if you're cease and you are
[1:33:37] the word now made manifest living and
[1:33:40] operative
[1:33:41] oh brother Branham said if a bride could
[1:33:43] just get her positive position and know
[1:33:46] her stand in this hour and know that
[1:33:48] this message was for running her the
[1:33:50] coming word it was it was the
[1:33:52] forerunning of Jesus Christ in Bride
[1:33:55] form
[1:33:56] what is this what is this bride form
[1:33:59] what is it the bride coming what is the
[1:34:01] what is this coming out of dark
[1:34:03] denominationalism
[1:34:06] it's Christ in Bride form
[1:34:08] or the bride coming of Christ
[1:34:11] that is the revelation
[1:34:14] that's why the bride sees it that's why
[1:34:16] the bride recognizes it
[1:34:18] she's the only one that can see that
[1:34:20] mystery of his coming
[1:34:24] you say well Brother David you're sure
[1:34:26] being no I'm not I'm being exactly what
[1:34:28] I should be to the word bride
[1:34:31] this is exactly the message she gets you
[1:34:34] say they're very few well very few that
[1:34:36] believe that I don't care how few it is
[1:34:38] I know that substance in me
[1:34:44] if I be the only one he said that makes
[1:34:47] it if you were living here I lived in
[1:34:48] Lime again I'd be the only one making
[1:34:50] alignment be me
[1:34:52] why because I hold that substance that's
[1:34:54] more real to me than I'm standing here
[1:34:56] on this platform that's real because
[1:34:58] that's real
[1:35:00] that's real because it's eternal
[1:35:06] you say do you walk in that every day
[1:35:08] every day well don't you have trials and
[1:35:10] struggles to test that has nothing to do
[1:35:12] with my trials struggles and tests I've
[1:35:14] overcome every one of those already
[1:35:17] what is it because I'm walking in him
[1:35:19] I'm putting him before me if I put him
[1:35:22] before me don't you make a mistake sure
[1:35:23] I make mistakes but what's that got to
[1:35:25] do with my relationship with God what's
[1:35:27] that got to do with the revelation of
[1:35:29] this substance what's that got to do
[1:35:30] with the revelation of where I came from
[1:35:34] that doesn't change it
[1:35:37] glory to God that does not change it
[1:35:42] you can't pull me out of a relationship
[1:35:44] with him when I was ordained in Union
[1:35:46] with him when I was already his thoughts
[1:35:48] expressed when I was already in his mind
[1:35:50] are you going to take me away from the
[1:35:51] relationship with him when I always was
[1:35:53] related I always was married I was
[1:35:56] married to him the old man is dead
[1:36:00] out of existence
[1:36:02] eternally separated I've been eternally
[1:36:04] separated that old man is dead
[1:36:07] eternally separated
[1:36:10] I come back to what I was in the
[1:36:11] beginning
[1:36:14] amen amen and now it's expressing the
[1:36:17] being that I am
[1:36:20] Glory
[1:36:22] I say Glory do you hear me
[1:36:25] glory to God
[1:36:28] says in a myth you know him
[1:36:32] you know who brother Bram said it's not
[1:36:34] it's to know him is to know the person
[1:36:37] Christ himself is to know him
[1:36:41] to know him is to know the person Christ
[1:36:44] himself
[1:36:48] is when you know him
[1:36:51] I wish I could figure this out quit
[1:36:53] trying to figure it out
[1:36:57] call upon God let go of yourself die to
[1:37:01] yourself
[1:37:02] let this
[1:37:04] give yourself in total abandonment to
[1:37:07] him
[1:37:08] well I don't know what might happen if I
[1:37:10] do that
[1:37:12] let go of yourself
[1:37:15] let go of your reasoning let go of it
[1:37:18] let God govern your being govern your
[1:37:21] thoughts govern your actions let God
[1:37:23] have control and be had over your senses
[1:37:27] bring every thought under obedience to
[1:37:29] Christ
[1:37:31] where's Christ he's my guide yes he's
[1:37:33] your guide he's in you
[1:37:36] trust him
[1:37:38] he's revealed in you trust him and you

[1:41:40] all the seed you see it's a promise
[1:41:42] isn't it it's a promise of God and you

[1:42:03] revelation of it now you say well
[1:42:06] Brother David it's not revealed to me
[1:42:07] I'm not saying it will or I won't I'm
[1:42:09] saying just keep feeding
[1:42:12] what's the desire what's the draw in
[1:42:14] your heart
[1:42:15] what's drawing you shows you what kind
[1:42:18] of filter you're going to draw through
[1:42:21] amen the desire of your soul
[1:42:23] is going to determine what filter you'll
[1:42:26] use
[1:42:27] if you're Desiring more of God and that
[1:42:30] desire's there he's provided a filter to
[1:42:32] take you in a body change
[1:42:34] because you can't draw anything through
[1:42:36] that filter but life eternal life and
[1:42:38] when you draw that eternal life it's
[1:42:40] going to Quicken that seed that's inside
[1:42:41] of you and that seed has got to come to
[1:42:44] full manifestation of his word
[1:42:48] God's got to fulfill it
[1:42:50] amen
[1:42:53] praise the Lord
[1:42:55] all right
[1:42:57] now you're getting into bride material
[1:43:02] so it's by faith so that the promise
[1:43:05] might be sure
[1:43:09] what is Faith the substance of things
[1:43:11] the substance of the promise
[1:43:15] you have the promise substance faith
[1:43:19] is a revelation of the will of God
[1:43:22] you have the revelation of the will now
[1:43:25] God showed you his will and what he
[1:43:27] thinks about you
[1:43:30] what he's determined about you
[1:43:33] now why don't we just walk on in the
[1:43:36] light
[1:43:38] amen thy light has come
[1:43:41] then lay in the presence of the light
[1:43:44] amen this is the message God is light
[1:43:48] and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:43:52] is that right and they that are in the
[1:43:54] light are not in darkness there's no
[1:43:55] shadow of turning with him isn't that a
[1:43:58] wonderful absolute no shadow of turning
[1:44:01] can't fail
[1:44:03] those thoughts of himself which are
[1:44:05] yourself Can't Fail they can't come to
[1:44:07] an end they can't fail
[1:44:08] God's thoughts won't fail they can't
[1:44:10] fail
[1:44:11] they've got to be fulfilled they've got
[1:44:13] to be expressed and when they're
[1:44:14] expressing the word the word which you
[1:44:16] are must be fulfilled
[1:44:20] now I've got to close
[1:44:22] let me just try to come to that place
[1:44:28] those that are royal seed are the elect
[1:44:30] of God are predestinated are for known
[1:44:38] you know it's enough to tell you right
[1:44:40] now that he he knew you
[1:44:42] that ought to be enough
[1:44:44] if you have the Revelation that he knew
[1:44:46] you that ought to be enough you say well
[1:44:48] he knows everything but I'm not talking
[1:44:49] about what he knows about everything I'm
[1:44:51] talking about his thoughts eternally
[1:44:53] the Eternal thoughts of himself he knew
[1:44:56] you
[1:44:58] he knows he knew you
[1:45:02] well brother
[1:45:04] if I know him
[1:45:06] how many know him
[1:45:08] okay then
[1:45:11] he had to know you first
[1:45:14] how are you going to get out of him
[1:45:16] when you're in him
[1:45:17] who's going to take you out of him who's
[1:45:19] going to say you're imperfect when
[1:45:21] you're perfect
[1:45:22] how who's going to say you how can the
[1:45:24] count who can accuse me of sin when I'm
[1:45:26] sinless
[1:45:28] Oh Brother David now we know you've gone
[1:45:30] off the deep end we know you have I'm
[1:45:32] not talking about this man I'm talking
[1:45:34] about the Eternal thought of God
[1:45:39] amen I'm talking about who I am
[1:45:42] Who You Are
[1:45:44] we're growing into that stature that's
[1:45:46] why all I can talk about is that how can
[1:45:48] I talk about anything else why would I
[1:45:50] talk about well this guy in this flesh
[1:45:52] and this mistake and this one and that
[1:45:53] one and the and every why discuss those
[1:45:56] kind of things I mean we discuss it but
[1:45:58] why why talk about my failures when I
[1:46:00] can talk about the positive position
[1:46:03] that I hold
[1:46:06] well you're just not living in reality
[1:46:07] no I am in reality you're the one out of
[1:46:10] reality
[1:46:12] well you're odd but it takes oddballs
[1:46:14] you know
[1:46:15] it takes a nut to hold the bolt we it
[1:46:17] takes a nut to bring the two together
[1:46:18] too
[1:46:20] amen
[1:46:23] that's right
[1:46:30] now you're getting into Rapture
[1:46:32] condition
[1:46:33] in plain language
[1:46:36] these elect are the Royal seed they
[1:46:38] elect they are the elect of God they
[1:46:40] were for known of God and were in the
[1:46:42] mind of God and in his thoughts if I
[1:46:45] never get any more of that you're going
[1:46:47] to know where you came from
[1:46:48] at least you're going to have a mental
[1:46:50] conception and say God I've got to have
[1:46:51] this reveal this to me I've heard this
[1:46:54] for years
[1:46:56] we've read that for years
[1:46:59] and all of a sudden
[1:47:01] now it's more than just reading
[1:47:04] now it becomes real
[1:47:06] now become substance
[1:47:10] what does the faith come by a hearing of
[1:47:13] the word what have I got to preach my
[1:47:14] own mind my own thinking no I'm going to
[1:47:17] preach what he said it's not just
[1:47:19] reading quotes anybody can read quotes
[1:47:20] anybody can take their knowledge and put
[1:47:22] quotes together I'm not talking about
[1:47:24] that I'm talking about the revelation of
[1:47:26] what's being said
[1:47:31] and if that same spirit's in you
[1:47:34] now watch what he said here
[1:47:39] watch what he said here
[1:47:40] before a word say he's referring to
[1:47:43] Saint John 1 before a word it's a
[1:47:45] thought and remember I started out with
[1:47:46] that now watch he said and the thought
[1:47:49] has to be created
[1:47:55] leave me alone I feel pretty good
[1:47:59] he said a thought has to be created all
[1:48:01] right so God's thoughts become creation
[1:48:04] when it was spoke by a word
[1:48:08] that's me Lord
[1:48:10] mama that's me
[1:48:14] the Bible said in that day
[1:48:17] you shall know Saint John 14 20 and that
[1:48:19] day you shall know that my father me and
[1:48:22] I and you and you and me and brother
[1:48:23] Bram said when this day comes along
[1:48:25] you'll know that he said and then you'll
[1:48:27] know it's he and you and you and him or
[1:48:29] him you and him and he and you
[1:48:33] is that right
[1:48:35] then you know who you are
[1:48:37] then he said in Saint John 15 7 if you
[1:48:40] abide in me and my word abides in you
[1:48:42] when were you when were you abiding I
[1:48:45] just got done talking you were existing
[1:48:47] you were existing in him
[1:48:50] you were birthed because you always were
[1:48:52] a part of him and when the word which
[1:48:54] expressed you came on the scene it
[1:48:56] quickened you
[1:48:58] the spirit coming through that word
[1:49:00] quickened you it was sent to Quicken
[1:49:02] that seed that's why only the bride only
[1:49:05] the elect can be reborn
[1:49:07] because in non-elect there's nothing to
[1:49:09] Quicken
[1:49:13] then if you've been quickened rise shine
[1:49:16] which having poochie lip disease
[1:49:19] rise up
[1:49:20] I'm not asking to be a show out here I'm
[1:49:23] just saying live what he said let it
[1:49:25] live through you let it live through you
[1:49:27] he said I'm going to work and live and
[1:49:29] work through the bride my word is
[1:49:31] working through you
[1:49:36] that's what you're here for
[1:49:37] that's what you're in the Earth for
[1:49:42] so it's a thought it had to be created
[1:49:43] when it spoke by a word it becomes
[1:49:45] creation
[1:49:46] then watch what he said then when it's
[1:49:49] then when he presents it to you
[1:49:52] as a thought
[1:49:56] when he presents it to you
[1:49:58] as a thought he reveals it and it's
[1:50:01] revealed to you he presents it to you of
[1:50:04] a thought and he said his thoughts and
[1:50:06] it's revealed to you
[1:50:09] then it's still a thought until you
[1:50:13] speak it
[1:50:15] that's why the prophet said up there in
[1:50:17] the mountain when that storm he said it
[1:50:19] was God that said you say to it
[1:50:22] it was God that revealed his thought to
[1:50:24] that prophet and it was still a thought
[1:50:26] until he said to the storm
[1:50:29] is that right it was still a thought
[1:50:31] when he said he said now you stand up he
[1:50:34] said whatever you say about meaty it'll
[1:50:36] be that way
[1:50:37] is that right and he couldn't he what
[1:50:40] what gave him that opportunity that's
[1:50:42] why he had always confused me how can I
[1:50:44] say as a man Mountain be removed how can
[1:50:48] I say it but it was it was his vocal
[1:50:51] cords but who was saying it it was that
[1:50:53] thought revealed inside of him it was
[1:50:55] God speaking to him
[1:50:58] it comes by Revelation the prophet said
[1:51:01] you wait on Revelation not just be all
[1:51:04] you think yours inspired but wait until
[1:51:06] it's revealed then speak and go forward
[1:51:08] that's all you have to do
[1:51:13] amen you're speaking his thought
[1:51:17] it's revealed to you that's why the just
[1:51:20] shall live by faith
[1:51:22] amen there you are
[1:51:25] Hallelujah
[1:51:26] all right I can tell you quote after
[1:51:28] quote how he said you wait for
[1:51:30] Revelation you wait on the Revelation
[1:51:31] and when it's revealed to you then go
[1:51:34] forward then you have thus saith the
[1:51:36] Lord
[1:51:39] amen who has it today she has it why
[1:51:42] because the word is opening the word is
[1:51:46] revealed the seals have been taken off
[1:51:47] your life and now God's obligated to his
[1:51:50] word to fulfill the word by revealing
[1:51:52] himself to you personally and realize
[1:51:55] who you are
[1:51:58] and he and the bride are no longer Twain
[1:52:01] he said she's United with the head
[1:52:03] what's he doing prophesying out they're
[1:52:05] no longer Twain now they're one the word
[1:52:07] message has gone out he said they're no
[1:52:10] longer Twain They Are One
[1:52:12] and we grow into that
[1:52:14] and we realize hey I'm one with him I
[1:52:17] know I'm no longer Twain now I'm one
[1:52:19] with him what God has joined together
[1:52:21] let no man put asunder and that man
[1:52:23] happens to be the very one you're
[1:52:25] sending in
[1:52:27] that's right did you catch that
[1:52:30] amen
[1:52:31] amen amen all right so
[1:52:36] what is faith faith is something that's
[1:52:38] revealed to you faith is the revelation
[1:52:41] of the will of God so by revelation
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:47] amen
[1:52:49] so by revelation
[1:52:56] now we're coming to a conclusion
[1:52:59] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:53:02] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:53:04] though not expressed until each
[1:53:07] came forth in the designated decreed
[1:53:10] season as each member came forth it
[1:53:12] became expressed and took its place in
[1:53:15] the body
[1:53:19] where's God's place of worship
[1:53:21] in the body
[1:53:24] where'd God put his name
[1:53:26] in the body
[1:53:28] and unless you're in the body
[1:53:30] you can't even worship Him
[1:53:34] that was strong wasn't it
[1:53:37] but that's what he said you've got to be
[1:53:39] in God's provided place of worship
[1:53:42] and how you're going to get there
[1:53:43] by birth
[1:53:45] what's the birth the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:47] Ghost upon that seed
[1:53:51] amen
[1:53:55] Hallelujah
[1:53:59] then you come face to face with
[1:54:01] something now you've come face to face
[1:54:03] with himself
[1:54:05] you've received the knowledge of the
[1:54:07] glory of God in the face or in the
[1:54:08] person of Jesus Christ
[1:54:11] that's to know him
[1:54:15] don't come short of that
[1:54:17] you're young people you say I've given
[1:54:19] my heart to the Lord I've been baptized
[1:54:21] that's good but have you received the
[1:54:23] Holy Ghost since you believed
[1:54:26] I don't say that just to young people I
[1:54:28] say that to old people too
[1:54:30] and I can say that because I'm one of
[1:54:32] you
[1:54:33] I'm not a young man anymore I don't know
[1:54:35] how much longer I've got to go but
[1:54:36] there's one thing I do know
[1:54:39] I have a glorified body waiting
[1:54:42] I may have to meet my theophany first
[1:54:43] but I'll sure rise again and come back
[1:54:45] to a glorified one
[1:54:47] he has to complete his thought of you
[1:54:54] Hallelujah
[1:54:59] I feel pretty good
[1:55:01] I don't go on feelings
[1:55:03] but this revelation
[1:55:05] tells me I don't care what I face I'm
[1:55:07] going to come to that Lord willing
[1:55:09] I don't care what we face it is Shalom
[1:55:15] amen
[1:55:21] it's a gift to God to believe you know
[1:55:25] let me just finish this up
[1:55:27] he said so
[1:55:28] we in turn
[1:55:30] now
[1:55:33] come conclusion Jesus dwelt in the
[1:55:36] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[1:55:38] Eternal one was with the father
[1:55:39] manifested in flesh
[1:55:41] excuse me that Eternal one was the
[1:55:43] father manifested in flesh and thereby
[1:55:46] gained the title of son
[1:55:48] even so we Eternal in his thoughts in
[1:55:51] our turn
[1:55:53] what was he he was the firstborn among
[1:55:56] the creation of God
[1:55:58] who are you the creation of God
[1:56:03] expressing himself through flesh
[1:56:07] how would he do that
[1:56:09] he elected you
[1:56:11] he foreknew you
[1:56:13] you were his thoughts and when those
[1:56:16] thoughts are revealed in you you realize
[1:56:18] who you are
[1:56:20] you're the very expression of God the
[1:56:23] very creation spoken word creation of
[1:56:26] God
[1:56:27] amen all right
[1:56:30] so he said
[1:56:33] he said in our turn we became the many
[1:56:35] membered spoken word seed manifested in
[1:56:37] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[1:56:40] manifest in flesh are of God
[1:56:44] excuse me in manifest in flesh are the
[1:56:46] sons of God even as we are so called we
[1:56:49] did not become seed by rebirth we were
[1:56:52] seed and therefore were Reborn
[1:56:56] as I said for only to let him be reborn
[1:57:00] if you are true seed you will hear that
[1:57:02] word
[1:57:03] you say well Brother David everybody's
[1:57:05] hearing it's not talking about this
[1:57:06] hearing it's got to come through here
[1:57:08] into here it's you here here
[1:57:11] you have an ear to hear
[1:57:14] or other words receive
[1:57:17] you can receive the word for your season

[1:58:08] amen are you with me
[1:58:10] the words in me bringing this body under
[1:58:13] obedience to it
[1:58:15] is that right

[1:58:40] if you pass from the scene he'll raise
[1:58:41] it again
[1:58:43] is that right it's not Resurrection is
[1:58:45] not replacement
[1:58:46] if I go in the grave this man not this
[1:58:48] sin not this not this old decrepit body
[1:58:52] but this body will rise again but what
[1:58:54] how will it raise sin can't raise
[1:58:58] Darkness can't raise death can't raise
[1:59:00] it's conquered
[1:59:02] amen but I raise up in a glorified body
[1:59:05] but it won't be in Jesus that went in
[1:59:07] the grave came out
[1:59:10] wasn't another person it was him the
[1:59:13] same body that they saw Gwen came out
[1:59:16] only now it's glorified
[1:59:19] walk through the room went in met him
[1:59:21] stood in their midst the doors locked

[2:00:16] a Master with reasoning you know that go
[2:00:18] listen to word go listen to go listen to
[2:00:20] wisdom versus faith and see what the

[2:09:50] as you think in your heart as a man
[2:09:53] thinketh in his heart
[2:09:54] so is he Psalm 23 7 as a man thinketh in

[2:11:28] he said
[2:11:29] he understood his position he knowed
[2:11:32] what he was because this is what the
[2:11:34] scripture said he was therefore he lied
[2:11:36] upon God who made him and if he did that

[2:13:08] he knew that that with that perfect
[2:13:10] faith that he was the anointed Messiah
[2:13:12] that the spirit of God was upon him and
[2:13:15] he said now I myself do nothing but it's
[2:13:17] my faith in God same thing with the
[2:13:19] bride and God was in him the word made
[2:13:21] manifest and when the word of God comes
[2:13:24] in you it's made manifest for you are a
[2:13:28] believer
[2:13:30] there's your identification you are an
[2:13:32] identified believer
[2:13:35] is that right didn't didn't Abraham
[2:13:38] didn't his faith have to be identified
