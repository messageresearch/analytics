[5:03] sat there in the way
[5:07] begging just to get through another
[5:11] day I could not walk been this way for
[5:16] such a long long
[5:20] time I thought this would be the way I'd

[5:32] I have given to thee rise up and walk in
[5:39] the name of the
[5:43] Lord then one day just as before the

[5:54] Mercy for I was in
[5:58] despair

[6:04] but it happened I was made whole as the
[6:09] man said unto
[6:13] me Silver and Gold Have I None but what
[6:19] I have I given to thee rise up and walk
[6:25] in the name of the Lord
[6:31] then I rose up from my bed running

[6:41] believe I've been made
[6:45] whole these legs as spend so
[6:49] Twisted never could
[6:52] move yes it sure is a miracle I now can
[6:58] walk

[13:19] amen let's bow our heads together this
[13:23] evening dear Lord Jesus we thank you for
[13:25] the privilege of standing here once
[13:27] again in this place Lord that's been
[13:30] consecrated to your worship Lord with
[13:33] brothers and sisters Lord who come with
[13:35] the same desire just to bring honor and
[13:38] glory to your name to hear your word
[13:41] Lord and to reverence it to surrender to
[13:43] it God I pray Lord that you'd come on
[13:46] the scene according to your promise for
[13:48] you said whereever two or three are
[13:50] gathered Lord so we know that you're
[13:52] here because you've never lied you've
[13:54] never told us anything wrong but we're
[13:56] here gathered in Your Name Lord not our
[13:58] our name but your name not just for our
[14:01] purpose but for your purpose not just
[14:03] for our desire though we desire but
[14:05] we're here by your bidding by your
[14:07] drawing because of your desire may
[14:09] everything we say or do bring glory and
[14:11] honor to Your Name Lord God I pray that
[14:14] you would feed us
[14:16] Lord God there's nothing Lord that we
[14:19] can do in of
[14:20] ourselves but God if we can yield
[14:22] ourselves to you that you can do beyond
[14:25] our ability that's what we're depending
[14:27] on that by your spirit you would do
[14:29] beyond our ability that you would take
[14:31] Lord a vessel of clay and you would use
[14:33] it to speak Eternal words of life that
[14:36] those words will go in deep inside of
[14:38] our hearts and change us Lord and that
[14:40] word would be a seed that' be planted in
[14:43] good ground and it would bring forth a
[14:44] Bountiful Harvest For Your Glory may it
[14:47] be so in our lives we ask in Jesus
[14:51] Christ's name speak tonight Lord we pray
[14:54] take the preeminence as we surrender it

[16:06] gathered together for the first time in
[16:08] a long long time so that everybody made
[16:10] it so it was nice so we appreciate that

[16:19] Simon it's good to have you and your
[16:20] family here so nice to have you back
[16:23] once again we really appreciate brother
[16:25] Simon stepping in and taking the service
[16:27] for us and we were able to stream while
[16:29] we were driving up from West Virginia
[16:31] and we got to stream the entire service
[16:32] and loved every minute of it I thought
[16:35] it was a wonderful word from the Lord
[16:36] and it was exciting to hear and we were
[16:38] in the van saying amen that's good
[16:41] praise the Lord and then he was doing
[16:43] stuff on the Whiteboard I never knew you
[16:44] could
[16:46] do and then they were watching behind
[16:49] they were streaming they had the the
[16:50] phone behind me so I couldn't see what
[16:52] he was doing I was driving and he goes
[16:55] I'll Zoom this in here I said you can
[16:57] zoom the Whiteboard
[16:59] I said did he just zoom
[17:02] that so I told Brother Simon yesterday
[17:04] he's going to have to give me
[17:05] instructions of training session on how
[17:07] to use the Whiteboard that I've been
[17:09] using for more than a
[17:10] year so God bless you brother Simon We
[17:13] Appreciate You yielding to the Lord it
[17:15] was a wonderful word and we certainly
[17:17] enjoyed it
[17:18] amen uh also want to remind you tomorrow
[17:21] night will be the church age book Bible
[17:23] study here in the fellowship hall it'll
[17:25] be the last one we'll be having for a
[17:26] month because we'll be traveling uh my
[17:28] daughters and I will be traveling to
[17:30] Australia to minister so uh we just want
[17:32] to remind you of that let's let's all
[17:35] stand together and let's turn in our
[17:36] Bibles to the Book of
[17:47] Romans Romans chapter
[17:51] 8 and then Romans chapter 8 and I'd like
[17:55] to read just two verses verse 17 and
[17:57] verse 8 18 Romans 8 verse
[18:03] 17 and if children then heirs HS of God
[18:06] and Joint HS with Christ if so be that
[18:09] we suffer with him that we may be also
[18:12] glorified together for I reckon that the
[18:14] sufferings of this present time are not
[18:17] worthy to be compared with the glory
[18:19] which shall be revealed in US man God
[18:22] bless you as you have your
[18:24] seats I want to take from this from this
[18:27] text uh a thought that I'd like to share
[18:30] with you and for a title we can take the
[18:32] resolve to suffer and the resolve to
[18:36] suffer and we've we've preached around
[18:38] on this subject many times you can't
[18:40] preach the Christian Life without
[18:41] preaching suffering or trials or
[18:43] tribulations and so we've touched on
[18:45] this many times but there's a certain
[18:47] aspect that I would like to just
[18:48] highlight and that's the resolve to
[18:50] suffer uh we find so many times that
[18:53] what really troubles Us in trials and
[18:56] tribulations what really I I believe
[18:58] causes us so much distress and turmoil
[19:01] is all of our efforts to avoid
[19:04] trials and we spend an exhaust and exert
[19:07] so much energy and so me much mental
[19:09] strain and our avoidance of what will
[19:12] come what will come anyways instead of
[19:15] just being resolved to suffer so I
[19:18] believe that we could spare ourselves so
[19:20] much mental strain and tribulation and
[19:22] trouble if we would just be resolved
[19:24] that this is a principle in the
[19:26] Christian Life and we're just going to
[19:28] be resolved to him let's go to 2 Timothy
[19:31] chap
[19:35] 2 second Timothy Chapter
[19:43] 2 and I'm going to read from uh verse 10
[19:47] 2 Timothy CH 2:10 therefore I under all
[19:50] things for the elect's sake that they
[19:52] may also obtain the Salvation which is
[19:55] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory it is
[19:58] a faithful saying for if we be dead with
[20:01] him we shall also live with him if we
[20:03] suffer we shall also reign with him if
[20:06] we deny him he also will deny us so if
[20:09] we suffer we shall
[20:11] reign and what he said before in Romans
[20:13] is that uh that we're joint HS with
[20:16] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[20:18] that we may also be glorified together
[20:20] so there's no option on suffering
[20:22] suffering is just part of the
[20:24] package uh let's turn to Philippians now
[20:27] Philippians chap
[20:32] 4 Philippians CH 4 and verse
[20:40] 10 in Philippians chap 4:1 it reads but
[20:44] I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now
[20:46] at the last your care of me has
[20:48] flourished again wherein you were also
[20:50] careful but you lacked opportunity he's
[20:52] talking about meeting a financial need
[20:54] that he has now he says not that I speak
[20:57] in respect of want for I have learned in
[20:59] whatsoever State I am therewith to be
[21:01] content I know both how to be abased and
[21:04] I know how to abound everywhere and in
[21:07] all things I'm instructed both to be
[21:09] full and to be hungry both to abound and
[21:11] to suffer need I can do all things
[21:14] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[21:17] that's the key phrase I can do all
[21:18] things through Christ which strengthen
[21:19] to me he knew how to do with much and he
[21:22] knew how to do with little how to abound
[21:23] and how to abase amen he was thanking
[21:26] them for meeting the financial need but
[21:27] not that he had want because he knew
[21:30] that in whatever state he was in there
[21:31] and to be content he had learned that
[21:33] Amen to to suffer with whatever God had
[21:36] allow and that with with God uh he can
[21:40] do all things through Christ with
[21:41] strengthened him let's turn to 2
[21:44] Corinthians now because we're picking
[21:47] this all up from the Apostle Paul and
[21:50] let's read 2
[21:53] Corinthians chapter
[21:57] 12
[22:01] 2 Corinthians chap
[22:03] 12 and verse
[22:10] 7 he says and lest I should be exalted
[22:13] above measure through the abundance of
[22:15] the revelations that were given to me a
[22:17] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[22:18] Satan to Buffet me or there I'm sorry
[22:22] there was given to me a thorn in the
[22:24] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[22:26] me lest I should be exalted a measure
[22:29] for this thing I besought the Lord
[22:30] Thrice that it might depart from me and
[22:33] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[22:35] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[22:37] in weakness most gladly therefore will I
[22:40] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[22:42] power of Christ May rest upon me
[22:44] therefore I take pleasure in infirmities
[22:47] in reproaches in Necessities in
[22:49] persecutions in distresses for Christ's
[22:51] sake for when I am weak then am I strong
[22:56] I marveled when he says this because we
[22:58] know the Apostle Paul did not want or
[23:00] desire this Affliction whatever the
[23:02] thorn was in his flesh wasn't something
[23:04] he was pleased with took pleasure and or
[23:06] wanted because he sought the Lord's
[23:08] Thrice to take it away so Paul's desire
[23:11] was not to have whatever this Affliction
[23:13] was he didn't want it it came upon him
[23:16] without him asking for it it was given
[23:18] to him it was a a messenger of Satan to
[23:20] Buffet him permitted by God he didn't
[23:22] want it he didn't want it to remain he
[23:24] was asking God for it to be removed and
[23:26] he asked three times and finally the
[23:28] word of the Lord came to him and said my
[23:30] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[23:32] strength is made perfect in weakness and
[23:34] when he got that answer I want you to
[23:37] watch his attitude because what we're
[23:38] talking about tonight is an attitude
[23:41] amen we we're going to talk about
[23:42] suffering but it's not about suffering
[23:44] everybody suffers everybody that's been
[23:47] born of a woman suffers everybody that's
[23:50] taken breath in and out in this world
[23:52] suffers to one degree or another
[23:54] suffering is not suffering is not just
[23:57] uh only reserved for Christians
[23:59] suffering is reserved for
[24:01] Humanity but what I want to talk about
[24:03] is our
[24:05] attitude when he found out that God had
[24:08] permitted this and wasn't intended to
[24:09] remove it and said my grace is
[24:11] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[24:14] made perfect in weakness he says most
[24:16] gladly therefore will most gladly
[24:19] therefore will I rather glory in my
[24:21] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[24:23] rest upon me therefore I take pleasure
[24:27] in
[24:28] infirmities what a statement amen that's
[24:31] not what he was saying before he got the
[24:33] word of the Lord he was asking for it to
[24:35] be removed he wasn't taking pleasure in
[24:36] infirmities but once he realized this is
[24:39] the will of God for my strength is made
[24:41] perfect in your weakness he says now I
[24:43] will take pleasure in infirmities that
[24:45] the and infirmities in reproaches in
[24:48] Necessities in persecutions in
[24:51] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[24:53] am weak then am I strong amen praise God
[24:58] so I love the attitude and that's what I
[25:01] want us to key in on because this is
[25:03] what separates Christians from the rest
[25:04] of the world Amen in uniting time and
[25:08] signs brother Bram says speaking of
[25:10] tension I was praying about it this
[25:12] morning what would you do if you didn't
[25:14] have tension and we know brother Bram
[25:16] was plagued with this tension this
[25:18] nervousness this tension he had from a
[25:19] small boy and it troubled him all the
[25:22] time everybody knew he had this tension
[25:24] his mother knew it and and but he he he
[25:27] was praying about it the morning he was
[25:29] preaching this sermon said what would
[25:32] you do if you didn't have tension just
[25:34] think of it tension is a part of living
[25:37] that kind of encouraged me when I
[25:38] thought that if you had no tension you'd
[25:40] be like a ragd doll you wouldn't have no
[25:42] feelings there'd be nothing you could
[25:44] work on a little further down he says
[25:47] and just think of feelings what if you
[25:48] didn't have any feelings no pains or
[25:50] Nothing what if there' be no pain at all
[25:54] you'd have no feelings at all just think
[25:58] just think for a minute of how much of
[26:01] human existence and how much human
[26:04] effort is directed towards the avoidance
[26:07] of
[26:08] pain how much money how much time how
[26:11] much effort do we spend trying to avoid
[26:15] pain I don't know I don't know if we
[26:17] could put a monetary value on it or we
[26:19] can give an allotment of time but I've
[26:21] spent a great deal of my time trying to
[26:23] avoid pain trying to bypass it trying to
[26:26] not suffer
[26:28] amen but brother B said what if you
[26:30] didn't have any pain you'd have no
[26:33] feelings at all and if you had no
[26:34] feeling then one of your senses would be
[26:36] gone see so everything's just right
[26:39] anyhow God just give us Grace to stand
[26:41] up to it that's the thing if I just
[26:44] stand up with that Grace and stand there
[26:47] and say we know that when this life is
[26:49] over the great ones on the other side
[26:51] where we're looking to go to and now we
[26:53] remember that all these things that's
[26:55] attention some people tries to introduce
[26:57] produce Christianity that you're free
[26:59] from worry no you're not you're free
[27:02] from tension oh no you add tension when
[27:04] you become a Christian because you was
[27:06] kind of happy go-lucky whatever it was
[27:08] out there not caring what you did but
[27:10] when you've become a real Christian
[27:12] every moment you're wondering am I
[27:13] pleasing my Lord if I could hear from
[27:16] him it puts you on tension puts you on
[27:18] guard that's what makes you what you are
[27:21] so after all tension is a blessing amen
[27:25] those of you who Ser suffer with nervous
[27:27] tension yeah it's a blessing prise God
[27:29] Amen and it's caused I I'm sure it's
[27:32] caused a lot of trouble nervousness and
[27:34] tension causes trouble causes distress
[27:37] causes anguish but the prophet of God
[27:39] saying it's a blessing believe
[27:41] it it's just the way you're looking at
[27:44] it it's just the way you're looking at
[27:46] it see if you just look the other side
[27:49] no matter how thin you slice anything
[27:50] you still got two sides to it see so you
[27:53] want to see both sides tension what
[27:56] what's this tension
[27:58] if I could have been born without this
[27:59] tension well if I wouldn't have had this
[28:02] tension I wouldn't have been what I am I
[28:05] wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps
[28:07] it was this tension that drove me to
[28:09] Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessing
[28:13] thing to
[28:15] meise see what I said about
[28:18] attitude he says it's just the way you
[28:20] look at it every situation in life has
[28:23] two sides to it and it just depends on
[28:25] the way we look at the situation
[28:28] and all of us are going to face
[28:30] situations we have faced we probably are
[28:33] facing we will be facing situation
[28:35] situation that causes anxiety situations
[28:38] that cause tension situations that cause
[28:40] pain or suffering and everything comes
[28:43] down to the way we view that situation
[28:47] is going to determine the way we behave
[28:49] towards that
[28:52] situation he goes on in this quote to
[28:54] say so then as Paul said as though when
[28:56] he had t ention or something or another
[28:58] he had consulted the Lord to take it
[29:00] away from him three times and the Lord
[29:03] said uh to my Paul he said my grace is
[29:05] sufficient he said then I'll glory in my
[29:08] infirmities then when I am weak I am
[29:10] strong as long as it's the will of God
[29:12] all right now I consulted him one time
[29:15] when it used to bother me so bad it
[29:17] scared me and he told me about 8 or 10
[29:20] years ago he said it'll never scare you
[29:22] again and it never has did it no sir
[29:25] don't worry about it I just feel it but
[29:28] I know it's there but I just go on
[29:30] because it it don't scare me no more so
[29:33] thankful for that now this is what he
[29:35] says next now he could have said it
[29:38] won't be no more just as well as that it
[29:41] won't scare you no
[29:43] more
[29:45] amen he was praying about it because it
[29:47] used he you know used to scare him you
[29:50] say what would scare you about this
[29:52] nervous tension well maybe it was scare
[29:54] him that he was losing control maybe it
[29:56] was fear F that he didn't know how bad
[29:58] it would get he he had to leave the
[30:00] field he left the ministry one time
[30:01] because of a nervous breakdown maybe he
[30:03] was fearful that he didn't know how far
[30:05] this tension would go and how bad it
[30:07] would get and it used to scare him and
[30:09] he sought the Lord and the Lord one time
[30:10] said it won't scare you no more he could
[30:12] have just as easily taking the tension
[30:15] away if he took the fear away he could
[30:17] take the tension away but somehow the
[30:19] tension served God's
[30:21] purpose amen so he took the fear away
[30:24] not the tension and then the next thing
[30:26] he said so it's his will that it
[30:29] happened so I just embrace it amen amen
[30:34] and say thank you Lord I'll walk that
[30:38] way
[30:42] H I'm going to say that again because it
[30:44] does something to me so it's his will
[30:47] that it happened so I'll just embrace it
[30:51] and say thank you Lord I'll walk that
[30:55] way the one thing that we we always try
[30:57] to do in life is get rid of our
[31:00] trials not embrace
[31:03] them but sometimes the only thing to do
[31:05] is embrace them because it's the will of
[31:12] God I want to look at Mark 14
[31:25] together let's look at Mark
[31:29] 14 and let's go to verse
[31:34] 32 Mark 14 and:
[31:39] 32 and they came to a place which was
[31:41] called Gethsemane and he said to the
[31:44] disciples sit ye here while I shall pray
[31:47] and he taketh with him Peter and James
[31:48] and John and began to be sore amazed and
[31:50] to be very heavy and saith unto them my
[31:53] soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death
[31:56] Terry you hear and watch and he went
[31:59] forward a little and fell on the ground
[32:00] and prayed that if it were possible the
[32:02] hour might pass from him and he said
[32:04] Abba Father all things are possible unto
[32:06] thee take away this cup from me
[32:09] nevertheless not what I will but what
[32:11] thou
[32:12] Willl here Jesus comes to the hour the
[32:16] hour of his great trial the hour of his
[32:18] suffering the hour of his
[32:20] persecution and when he comes his soul
[32:23] was exceedingly sorrowful unto death he
[32:26] was great Agony and sorely
[32:29] amazed
[32:31] and Jesus wasn't looking forward to the
[32:35] trial in his flesh he didn't want it I
[32:40] hope you can understand what I'm saying
[32:41] he didn't want it he wanted to bypass it
[32:45] so as a human being as the man he wanted
[32:48] to go around this obstacle and he said
[32:50] father if there's any way that this can
[32:53] pass
[32:54] me but then he says but not my will but
[32:57] thine so he continually surrenders we
[33:00] know he does this three times but he
[33:01] surrenders to the will of God but what
[33:04] he would like to do is bypass this hour
[33:07] he would like to bypass this trial he is
[33:09] a man brother B said he was 100% man
[33:11] 100% God now when you figure it out ma
[33:15] mathematically when you can solve that
[33:16] equation come and talk to me but it's
[33:18] nonetheless absolutely true he was 100%
[33:21] man he was 100% godone And as a man he
[33:24] wanted to bypass he was already
[33:26] suffering uffing with the the mental
[33:28] anguish the emotional anguish of what
[33:30] was laying ahead of him was causing him
[33:32] to be sorely amazed and be in anguish
[33:35] and severe
[33:36] anguish so this wasn't this wasn't an
[33:39] easy thing this wasn't an easy trial and
[33:42] he and he and he sought the father that
[33:45] if it were possible and and he starts
[33:46] off by saying father all things are
[33:48] possible to you have you ever prayed
[33:51] that have you ever been in the mid
[33:52] middle of a trial and said God you could
[33:54] so
[33:55] easily
[33:57] God this is nothing for you you could so
[33:59] easily amen you remove Devils by the
[34:02] Finger of God I mean you could so easily
[34:05] get me out of this situation you could
[34:06] rescue me the whole situation could
[34:08] change
[34:10] tomorrow have you ever prayed that way
[34:13] well you're praying just like Jesus
[34:16] prayed Abba he says Abba Father all
[34:18] things are possible unto thee take away
[34:20] this cup from me that's what he says
[34:23] take away this God you can do anything
[34:25] take this away from me
[34:28] nevertheless not what I will but thou
[34:31] Wilt amen and he cometh and he findeth
[34:34] them sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon
[34:36] sleepest thou couldest not thou watch
[34:38] one hour watch ye and pray lest you
[34:40] enter in Temptation the spirit is truly
[34:42] ready but the flesh is weak and again he
[34:45] went away and prayed and spake the same
[34:47] words and when he returned he found them
[34:49] asleep again for their eyes were heavy
[34:51] neither wish they what to answer him and
[34:54] he cometh the third time and saith unto
[34:56] them them sleep on
[34:58] now something had
[35:01] changed after the third time there was a
[35:05] resolve I could say there was a resolve
[35:07] in him to
[35:08] suffer he had sought the Lord he had
[35:11] asked if it was possible to be bypassed
[35:13] he had gotten the word from the Lord
[35:15] three times he had asked the father if
[35:18] he could bypass this trial and three
[35:20] times there was no no yes answer and
[35:23] each time he was willing to surrender to
[35:25] the will of God and each time the answer
[35:28] never changed and finally he comes back
[35:30] and he says sleep on
[35:33] now and take your rest it is enough the
[35:37] hour has come behold the son of man is
[35:40] betrayed into the hands of sinners rise
[35:42] up let us go Lo he that betrayeth me is
[35:45] at
[35:47] hand there's something about that
[35:51] statement that amazes
[35:54] me just before he he's in great sore
[35:58] amazement and great anguish and
[36:01] sorrow and he's seeking the almighty God
[36:04] the Father who can take away every
[36:06] circumstance and change everything and
[36:08] asking him to remove this cup from him
[36:12] but then surrendering his will to the
[36:13] father's will and even in another gospel
[36:16] he comes and he talks to his disciples
[36:18] and he he he expresses
[36:21] disappointment he says what could you
[36:23] not watch with me one
[36:25] hour don't you know what I'm going
[36:27] through don't you know what's happening
[36:30] can you not just bear with me couldn't
[36:32] you just be a friend to me could you not
[36:34] watch with me one hour how many times do
[36:36] you get in a trial and for you it's the
[36:38] greatest trial of your life but for your
[36:39] friends it's not a big deal yes they
[36:42] don't understand the anguish they don't
[36:44] understand the the tension they don't
[36:46] understand what you're going through and
[36:48] you feel all alone and all forsaken
[36:50] you're asking God to change the
[36:51] situation and it doesn't look like the
[36:53] Situation's going to change amen
[36:58] and he was went from sorely amazed and
[37:01] in great
[37:02] anguish and disappointed in his friends
[37:05] for not watching with him one hour and
[37:08] he goes through all of these
[37:09] emotions and then he finally comes to a
[37:14] resolve and when he comes to the resolve
[37:18] to me it's beautiful yes sleep on now
[37:22] and take your
[37:23] rest before he says why couldn't you
[37:26] walk why are you asleep what are you
[37:28] doing sleeping why can't you watch with
[37:30] me I need you to pray with
[37:33] me and now he says it's okay take your
[37:37] rest it's all settled I know the will of
[37:41] God sleep on now and take your rest it
[37:43] is enough the hour has come behold the
[37:46] son of man is betrayed under the hand he
[37:49] he listen there there is no doubt in his
[37:52] mind what's getting ready to happen he
[37:54] understands the situation this is isn't
[37:56] ignorance Blissful ignorance that he's
[37:58] moving into not knowing he knows exactly
[38:01] where this is going he knows where this
[38:02] is going to lead he knows exactly what's
[38:04] taking place but he's got such a resolve
[38:07] and such a peace and such a stability
[38:09] because now he's stepping into the will
[38:11] of father he has surrendered his
[38:14] will he said the son of man is betrayed
[38:17] into the hands of sinners rise up let us
[38:19] go Lo he that betrayeth me is at
[38:25] hand one of the things I love about this
[38:27] is when Jesus comes to this resolve from
[38:31] anguish and sorrow to disappointment and
[38:35] friends and calling out to God to
[38:38] resolve now this resolve carries him
[38:41] right through the the worst trial the
[38:43] most difficult set of circumstances a
[38:45] human being can go through he is
[38:47] betrayed he is he is he is rejected and
[38:51] he is
[38:53] forsaken then he is uh uh mocked he is
[38:57] scored he is falsely accused he is
[39:01] beaten he is uh uh nailed to a cross and
[39:05] he's left to die like the trial this
[39:07] isn't like losing your
[39:10] job this isn't like your spouse you know
[39:13] saying something cruel and mean to you
[39:15] and hurting your this is we're at a
[39:17] whole new level
[39:19] here but the resolve carries him through
[39:21] the trial and the way he conducts
[39:23] himself as he moves forward with the
[39:25] resolve to suffer to me is is Paramount
[39:28] it it to me it's our goal this is what
[39:30] we're striving for amen it's not that we
[39:33] don't have emotion Jesus it wasn't that
[39:34] he didn't have emotion he wasn't sterile
[39:37] he was 100% man amen he felt amen he
[39:40] suffered he had anguish he had sorrow
[39:44] amen he he did not want to suffer he did
[39:46] not want to go through the trial he did
[39:48] not want to feel the pain he did not
[39:50] want to separate one from his friends he
[39:52] knew all the feelings that we feel yes
[39:56] but yet when he knew the will of God and
[39:58] he resolved himself to do the will of
[40:00] God he was able to walk into suffering
[40:03] amen and as a lamb SI silent before the
[40:06] Sligh before before the slaughter and a
[40:08] sheep silent before the shears he was
[40:11] able to go dumb because he had already
[40:13] resolved he didn't have to defend
[40:14] himself he didn't have to I mean he
[40:16] didn't say anything mean to
[40:22] Judas what would we have said if we knew
[40:25] what Judas has done and he come all he
[40:28] said was Judas betray us the son of man
[40:30] with a
[40:33] kiss when he stood uh when he stood in
[40:37] the the trial and and the whole trial
[40:40] was was was a
[40:42] total
[40:44] sham right he didn't defend himself he
[40:49] didn't try to get out of it he didn't he
[40:53] just stood and let him say what they
[40:54] were going to say he didn't defend
[40:55] himself cuz he knew the will of God and
[40:58] even when when pilate says know you not
[41:00] that I have the power he says you have
[41:01] no powerless it's given to you from
[41:04] heaven from above he knew what was going
[41:07] on that God was in charg but the resolve
[41:09] to suffer amen brought out such a
[41:11] beautiful character amen that he didn't
[41:13] have to panic he didn't have to be
[41:14] afraid he didn't have to defend himself
[41:16] he didn't have to become angry or bitter
[41:18] or any of the things that happened to us
[41:20] when we get into a situation that's not
[41:22] near as intense as
[41:24] this why cuz he was resolved to
[41:27] suffer the prophet of God tells us in
[41:30] the church age book in the saman church
[41:31] age he reads Hebrews 5 and8 5 uh chapter
[41:36] 5: 8 and9 says though were he he were a
[41:39] son he learned obedience by the things
[41:41] which he suffered and being made perfect
[41:43] he became the author of Eternal
[41:44] salvation unto all them that obey him in
[41:48] plain language the very character of
[41:50] Jesus was perfected by
[41:53] suffering did you did you get the impact
[41:57] of what brother bam just
[41:59] said the character of Jesus was
[42:02] perfected by
[42:04] suffering I didn't know that his
[42:06] character needed
[42:09] perfecting praise God but he said the
[42:12] very character of Jesus was perfected by
[42:15] suffering and if his character was
[42:17] perfected by suffering how is our
[42:19] character going to be
[42:21] perfected the very character of Jesus
[42:23] was perfected by suffering and according
[42:25] to Paul he has left his church a
[42:27] measuring of suffering and they too by
[42:30] their faith in God while suffering for
[42:32] him would come to a place of
[42:35] perfection he goes on to say unless we
[42:37] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[42:39] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[42:41] for this is that character simply is
[42:43] never made without suffering character
[42:45] is a victory not a gift a man without
[42:48] character can't Reign because power
[42:49] apart from character satanic but Power
[42:52] with characters fit to rule and since he
[42:55] wants us to share even his throne on the
[42:57] same basis that he overcame and is sat
[43:00] down on his father's Throne then we have
[43:02] to overcome to sit with him and the
[43:04] little temporary sufferings we go
[43:06] through now is not worthy to be compared
[43:08] to the tremendous Glory that will be
[43:10] revealed in us when he comes all what
[43:13] Treasures are laid up for those who are
[43:14] willing to enter into his kingdom
[43:16] through much tribulation
[43:19] amen then he quotes from Peter he says
[43:22] think it not strange concerning the
[43:23] fiery trials that are to try you that is
[43:26] what Peter said is it strange that God
[43:29] wants to develop a Christlike character
[43:31] that comes through suffering no sir and
[43:33] we all have trials we are all tried and
[43:36] chasen his sons not one but goes through
[43:40] that he says is it strange that God
[43:43] wants to develop Christlike character
[43:45] why are these things happening to us is
[43:47] it strange that he wants to if if Jesus
[43:50] Christ's character was perfected by
[43:52] suffering is it
[43:53] strange that we would have trials and
[43:55] tribul ations we shouldn't think it
[43:58] strange but the the re the reality is we
[44:02] always think it
[44:04] strange we always think it's somehow
[44:08] unfitting
[44:09] unfair
[44:14] undeserved and that may not be you you
[44:15] may have risen to a higher level of
[44:17] maturity but God's still working on me
[44:19] because every time I go to why God is
[44:21] this happening and why why am I
[44:23] suffering and why do you let this happen
[44:24] and why didn't you prevent this and you
[44:26] could have stopped this and why is that
[44:28] going on and why is this going on why
[44:29] why why why why on brother and then
[44:32] really I find for me I find so many
[44:35] times that when when it comes to the
[44:37] trials and tribulations of life and
[44:39] listen I don't mean just trials and
[44:41] tribulations because we're being
[44:42] persecuted for the gospel sake amen
[44:44] there's a whole lot of other trials and
[44:46] tribulations that are shaping Us in life
[44:48] amen but the trials and tribulations of
[44:51] life I find that so many times I cause
[44:54] myself way way more mental stress and
[44:57] strain than the actual trial would cause
[45:00] me by trying to fight the very fact that
[45:03] it's happening and resist it and try to
[45:06] find a mechanism with which I can avoid
[45:08] it and trying to find my own way out and
[45:11] trying to dodge the bullet as it was to
[45:13] say Amen it reminds me of when I was in
[45:15] school you know when I was in school I'd
[45:17] get assigned a research paper you got a
[45:19] five-page research
[45:22] paper that is the trial of my life
[45:28] and I would do anything but sit down and
[45:30] write that
[45:32] paper I would think I've got to go to
[45:34] the library first so I'll wait till I go
[45:35] to the library go to the library I got
[45:38] to get books well I got the books I know
[45:40] nobody goes to the library
[45:41] anymore but that's what we used to have
[45:43] to
[45:46] do oh I'll read this book and I'll read
[45:48] that book okay well I I'll start writing
[45:50] but I got to write an outline first well
[45:52] I I and you just kick the can down the
[45:54] road and you find some excuse and you
[45:56] don't do it and you delay it and there
[45:58] you are the night before and you got to
[45:59] write a five page uh research paper amen
[46:03] and so if you finally just sit down and
[46:05] you just start writing you know what
[46:07] always happens by the time you actually
[46:10] sit down to write it and get done it
[46:11] really wasn't that
[46:13] bad it really wasn't a big deal I caused
[46:16] myself weeks of stress weeks of strain
[46:19] weeks of mental anguish dreading writing
[46:22] this paper dreading all the things I
[46:24] going to the hours of Anguish and
[46:26] finding another way and the fact is when
[46:28] I sat down to write it you just start
[46:29] flowing and it works and one thought
[46:31] builds to another and before you know
[46:32] you're done writing the paper and if I
[46:34] would have wrote it the day it was
[46:35] assigned I would have had it done way
[46:37] ahead of time I would have passed
[46:38] through that trial I wouldn't have
[46:40] complained I wouldn't have become bitter
[46:42] I wouldn't have accused the teacher of
[46:43] being mean and rude and a hateful
[46:45] teacher and not liking the
[46:49] students wishing I was in Mrs so and
[46:51] so's class you
[46:53] know how much mental I mean this is a
[46:56] childish example but this example
[46:59] matches everything in life take it to
[47:01] work take it to family bring it into the
[47:03] church amen we cause ourselves all the
[47:06] trouble cuz we're not just resolved to
[47:08] pass through a
[47:09] [Applause]
[47:11] trial and then before you know what God
[47:13] doesn't like you because you're in Mr
[47:14] so- and so's class and not Mrs so- and
[47:16] so's
[47:17] class and it never works out for me and
[47:20] it always works out for other
[47:22] people and before you know it you've got
[47:24] God off the throne and forgot where
[47:25] you're at and he's not in control
[47:27] anymore everybody around you now is in
[47:31] control the problem is when we don't
[47:34] just resolve ourselves to suffer and
[47:35] move the way God wants us to move then
[47:37] all of a sudden we bring God off of the
[47:39] throne we put him down here and now
[47:41] Pilot's the one in control of this yeah
[47:46] right now it's everybody else around me
[47:50] right it's Mr this teacher in this
[47:52] school in the Ohio state for requiring a
[47:55] curriculum that be so foolish
[48:01] and I remember I missed recess for a
[48:03] whole week cuz I couldn't finish my
[48:04] multiplication
[48:09] tables oh the burden that sometimes we
[48:12] suffer
[48:14] through I had to get my one to one
[48:17] through 10 multiplication tables
[48:19] memorized and filled out and I didn't
[48:21] get it done in time and listen it wasn't
[48:24] because I wasn't capable
[48:26] it wasn't because I couldn't do it it
[48:28] wasn't because I couldn't memorize it
[48:30] wasn't because I didn't understand the
[48:31] concept it was because I just didn't
[48:33] want to do
[48:34] it cuz it was going to take a little bit
[48:37] of mental strain it was going to take a
[48:39] little bit of application applying
[48:41] myself and I was going to actually have
[48:42] to not play until 10:00 at night I was
[48:44] actually going to have to sit down and
[48:46] like like like memorize it and I didn't
[48:49] want to cuz I didn't like it right and
[48:52] then all the kids go out the
[48:54] recess and then I can see him running by
[48:57] we had a lower floor and the window was
[48:59] up high and I could see feet moving
[49:01] by and all of a
[49:03] sudden the disdain for my
[49:10] teacher and my hatred for math in
[49:18] general the problem is when we take that
[49:20] in later in life we start to attach that
[49:24] to people yeah
[49:26] yes that's right this person who hurt me
[49:29] my dad my mom that brother my
[49:37] boss who gave you your mother and your
[49:40] father who gave you your
[49:43] job who forsaw your
[49:45] trials who knows what character he's
[49:48] molding and who knows what he's trying
[49:51] to draw out of the seed that's inside of
[49:53] you question is is God still on the
[49:55] Throne is everybody else in
[49:57] control does God still know and ordain
[50:00] the footsteps of the righteous or or is
[50:02] it just a halfhazard random life and
[50:04] everybody else can do me wrong any time
[50:06] and and throw throw the course off and
[50:09] mess up God's plan and ruin
[50:12] everything we can't have it both ways
[50:14] it's either one or the
[50:17] other and so you can see how not
[50:20] resolving to suffer all of a sudden it
[50:23] creates in US extra anguish extra
[50:25] turmoil listen if I would have took the
[50:28] assignment and studied my multiplication
[50:29] tables I was more than capable of
[50:31] memorizing them in short order I could
[50:33] have filled it out when all the other
[50:34] kids fill it out and I could have went
[50:35] to recess when everybody else went to
[50:37] recess and I wouldn't have had to
[50:38] struggle with
[50:42] bitterness I wouldn't have had to fight
[50:44] off
[50:48] self-pity you know the reason I use
[50:50] multiplication tables and because if I
[50:52] start using real examples that we all
[50:54] face with on a daily basis some of you
[50:56] are going to get offended at
[50:59] me so I've got to use multiplication
[51:03] tables and research papers because this
[51:06] hits way too close to
[51:07] home because it because my it becomes my
[51:10] husband it becomes my wife it becomes
[51:11] the minister it becomes the Sunday
[51:13] school teacher it becomes my coworker it
[51:15] becomes my
[51:18] boss that's right true and instead of
[51:23] saying God you let this trial pass
[51:27] me but if
[51:29] not thy will be done and just give me
[51:33] the grace to stand up to
[51:36] it remember brother Ram talked about
[51:39] when the slave buyer was going down the
[51:41] South and he was looking for slaves and
[51:43] he come across this one and and he saw a
[51:46] young man in the field and that young
[51:48] man he he held his head high he kind of
[51:51] had an air of dignity about him he went
[51:52] all of his work and he never had to be
[51:55] persu persuaded he never had to be beat
[51:56] he never he he just did it and he
[51:58] started asking about him and and and the
[52:00] owner began to sing his accolades and
[52:02] you know never have to whip him never
[52:04] have to do anything and and he wanted to
[52:07] buy him he said he's not for sale and he
[52:09] began to ask what what is it that makes
[52:10] him so different do you treat him
[52:12] different no he treats the same eat
[52:13] different no he at eats the same and he
[52:16] found out that in his homeland his
[52:18] father was the was the king of a tribe
[52:21] and though he's away from home he
[52:22] conducts himself as the son of a king
[52:26] brother man brought that lesson he told
[52:27] it so many times it's such a simple
[52:29] lesson but the reality should be true
[52:31] for us every day amen why should I bring
[52:34] myself down to gravel to complain to
[52:37] become bitter and disappointed in life
[52:39] when my father is the king and actually
[52:41] my father sent me on this journey
[52:43] because he wants me to rule and reign
[52:45] with him one day and so he wants me to
[52:47] gain some character so that he can bring
[52:49] me back to the throne and be a joint air
[52:51] with him amen the whole thing is serving
[52:53] a purpose a great purpose and and it all
[52:55] has to do with me being exalted on high
[52:57] and placed on the throne with the
[52:59] character fit the rule nothing bad is
[53:01] happening to
[53:03] me that's why the message of the hour
[53:05] and the end time is so beautiful that it
[53:07] absolutely it peels back amen all the
[53:10] confusion of our life it takes the seals
[53:13] off our life so we can see where we came
[53:15] from why we're here where we're going
[53:17] and what the purpose is in our life so
[53:19] that we can begin to conduct ourselves
[53:21] as children of the
[53:23] king we we eat what everybody else in
[53:26] the world eats we sleep where everybody
[53:28] else in the world sleeps we get treated
[53:30] like everybody else in the world gets
[53:32] treated but we should conduct ourselves
[53:34] completely different than everybody
[53:38] else we are sold into the slavery of
[53:41] hybridization like every other slave
[53:43] that's on this
[53:47] planet but we should conduct ourselves
[53:51] differently let's go to Genesis 37
[53:54] together
[54:03] Genesis
[54:13] 37 and verse 26 Genesis
[54:17] 37 and verse
[54:20] 26 we're going to look at the life of
[54:22] Joseph just with a few scriptures
[54:25] Genesis
[54:27] 37-26 and Judas said unto his Brethren
[54:29] what prophit is it if we slay our
[54:31] brother and conceal his blood Come and
[54:34] Let Us sell him to the Israelites and
[54:36] let not our hand be upon him for he is
[54:38] our brother and our flesh and his
[54:42] Brethren were
[54:43] content so here they're going to take
[54:45] their little brother who they hate
[54:47] because he's
[54:49] spiritual he's done nothing
[54:52] wrong he's done nothing wrong to them
[54:54] he's done nothing wrong but because
[54:56] they're jealous and they have envy and
[54:58] they hate him they're going to take him
[55:00] and they're going to sell him into
[55:04] slavery now I've never been treated like
[55:08] this but I can tell you if I had there
[55:12] would be a lot of things going on in my
[55:13] emotional
[55:16] realm I've never been betrayed the way
[55:18] Jesus have been betrayed but if I had
[55:21] there would be a lot of things going on
[55:23] in my emotional Realm would set up a
[55:26] struggle it would set up a struggle that
[55:28] was beyond the
[55:32] slavery because being sold into slavery
[55:34] has one
[55:36] struggle but being in torment and
[55:38] turmoil in your mind is something
[55:39] completely
[55:42] different Genesis
[55:45] 39 verse
[55:48] 1 Genesis 39 And1 and Joseph was brought
[55:52] down to Egypt and pfer an officer of
[55:54] pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian
[55:57] bought him of the hands of the
[55:58] ishmaelites which had brought him down
[56:01] thither and the Lord was with Joseph and
[56:03] he was a prosperous man and he was in
[56:05] the house of his master the Egyptian and
[56:07] his master saw that the Lord was with
[56:09] him and that the Lord made all that he
[56:11] did to prosper in his hand and Joseph
[56:13] found Grace in his sight and he served
[56:16] him and he made him overseer over his
[56:18] house and all that he had he put into
[56:20] his hand and it came to pass from that
[56:22] time that he made him Overseer in his
[56:24] house and over all that he had that the
[56:26] Lord blessed the Egyptians house for
[56:28] Joseph's sake and the blessing of the
[56:30] Lord was upon all that he had in the
[56:31] house and in the field and he left all
[56:34] that he had in Joseph's hand and he knew
[56:36] not ought he had save the bread which he
[56:38] did eat and Joseph was a goodly person
[56:40] and well
[56:42] favored there's something that I draw
[56:44] out of this when I look at this in
[56:46] context of what we're talking about
[56:48] Joseph having done nothing wrong he's
[56:49] hated and betrayed by his Brethren he's
[56:52] despised for no good reason because he
[56:54] he is what what God made him he sold
[56:56] into slavery when he sold into slavery
[56:57] he goes down and and while he's down
[57:00] there he's he's bought by potier now
[57:02] he's Piper's property and we we know all
[57:04] of this but something is unusual
[57:08] here because he must conduct himself in
[57:11] an unusual
[57:15] way because potterer sees something in
[57:19] Joseph that's
[57:21] special I don't think Joseph was angry
[57:25] contemptuous and
[57:28] bitter I don't think pfer would have
[57:30] made him ruler over his
[57:32] house right I don't think he was sour
[57:35] and
[57:36] contrary I don't think he was depressed
[57:38] and downgraded to the point of not
[57:40] speaking no doubt he was upset no doubt
[57:43] he had all all the emotions that we
[57:45] would go through but there was something
[57:47] different about Joseph and that Joseph
[57:49] in this situation he was able to project
[57:52] another kind of life and the life he
[57:54] kind of tried to project caused Piper to
[57:56] take note of him and Piper took him and
[57:58] began to give him Authority and began to
[58:00] give him uh uh different different
[58:02] rulership over different things until
[58:04] finally Joseph ruled everything that was
[58:07] in his house and he didn't even know
[58:08] what he had coming or going only the
[58:11] what he sat down to eat he knew he had
[58:13] that everything else was in Joseph's
[58:15] hands
[58:17] amen I'm I'm just believe with alight
[58:19] there's no way Joseph could have got
[58:20] there sour and bitter and nasty and
[58:24] angry and blaming everybody else for his
[58:27] problems no way no way he could operate
[58:30] at that level amen he was operating at a
[58:32] totally different
[58:34] level so that situation is bad enough
[58:37] because he's taken from his father he's
[58:38] taken from his family he's taken from
[58:40] the land that he's promised amen now
[58:42] he's in slavery but the situation goes
[58:44] from bad to worse so
[58:47] 3919 and it came to pass when his master
[58:50] heard the words of his wife why because
[58:52] Piper's wife tried to have Joseph for
[58:54] her herself and he fled and it came to
[58:57] pass when his master heard the words of
[58:58] the wife which she spoke unto him saying
[59:00] after this manner did the servant to me
[59:02] that his wrath was kindled and Joseph's
[59:05] Master took him and put him into prison
[59:07] a place where the king's prisoners were
[59:08] bound and he was there in the prison my
[59:13] verse 21 but the Lord was with Joseph
[59:15] and showed him mercy and gave him favor
[59:17] in the sight of The Keeper of the prison
[59:19] and The Keeper of the prison committed
[59:20] to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that
[59:22] were in the prison and whatsoever they
[59:24] did there was the doer of it the keeper
[59:26] of the prison looked not to anything
[59:28] that was under his hand because the Lord
[59:30] was with him and that which he did the
[59:32] Lord made it to
[59:33] prosper so when the trial gets
[59:37] worse it wasn't like Joseph could endure
[59:40] for so long but now there's no way I can
[59:43] take this Lord you've given me too much
[59:47] this trial has gone beyond my ability
[59:49] this is this is over the top this is not
[59:51] right there's no way and and no there
[59:54] must must have been something that
[59:55] carried Joseph through cuz when he got
[59:57] down to prison of all the prisoners that
[59:59] were there amen some I mean we know that
[1:00:02] there were some there that were the
[1:00:04] Butler and the Baker and one was justly
[1:00:06] in prisoned one was unjustly impr
[1:00:09] prisoned so who who knows what
[1:00:11] situations he found but no doubt what
[1:00:14] kind of attitudes and temperaments and
[1:00:16] sourness and oh I don't you you can only
[1:00:19] imagine what was in that
[1:00:21] prison but there was something about
[1:00:23] Joseph that made made him different to
[1:00:25] The Keeper of the prison than any of the
[1:00:27] other
[1:00:29] prisoners and and it wasn't his sour
[1:00:32] attitude it wasn't his hatefulness it
[1:00:34] wasn't his disrespect for the
[1:00:38] guard like he didn't feel
[1:00:41] Justified and and being short-tempered
[1:00:43] and short fused with the guard because
[1:00:45] he was unjustly
[1:00:50] treated we justify so much horrible
[1:00:53] conduct
[1:00:57] we self justify so many things that
[1:01:00] should never come out of our mouth we
[1:01:03] justify it because of hurt because I'm
[1:01:06] offended they hurt me they they
[1:01:08] shouldn't have treated me this way I
[1:01:10] shouldn't be in this prison I shouldn't
[1:01:11] be treated this way and we we'd start to
[1:01:14] justify our short fuse our our bad
[1:01:17] temperament our nasty
[1:01:20] attitudes there's no justification for
[1:01:23] it no matter what happens
[1:01:26] so something was different about Joseph
[1:01:28] and and that brought him to the
[1:01:30] attention of the guard and the and the
[1:01:32] keeper of the prison gave him Authority
[1:01:34] until all of the sudden amen Joseph
[1:01:37] listen Joseph wasn't an angry
[1:01:39] contentious bitter human being or he
[1:01:42] would not have been given charge of the
[1:01:44] entire
[1:01:48] prison and you know we look back and
[1:01:51] read the Bible and we see everything is
[1:01:53] so perfect it's perfect it's the perfect
[1:01:56] plan of God everything worked out
[1:01:58] perfect but while they were living it it
[1:02:01] didn't look so perfect I would assure
[1:02:04] you that Joseph wasn't thinking ah yes
[1:02:07] this is
[1:02:09] perfect I'm going down to Egypt because
[1:02:11] I got to go to Egypt to save my brethren
[1:02:14] I mean years from now there's going to
[1:02:16] be a famine and years from now they're
[1:02:18] going to need me to be at the right hand
[1:02:19] of pharaoh and I I can see it
[1:02:23] perfect
[1:02:25] how many trials have we been through
[1:02:27] when God upset our world and totally
[1:02:29] totally rocked our world and changed
[1:02:31] everything and we were so disappointed
[1:02:33] and so discouraged and then years later
[1:02:35] you look back and say that was
[1:02:36] absolutely perfect God God knew exactly
[1:02:39] what he was doing I lost that job and I
[1:02:41] loved that job and I wanted that job and
[1:02:43] they let it go but now years later you
[1:02:45] can look back and say that was the hand
[1:02:46] of
[1:02:48] God but you didn't know it the day you
[1:02:50] lost your job you didn't know it when
[1:02:52] you were going through the trial you can
[1:02:54] only look back and see it and God was
[1:02:56] working a plan all the time in your life
[1:02:59] and he knew you would hit disappointment
[1:03:01] you would hit discouragement amen but as
[1:03:03] a Son of God you've got to stand up and
[1:03:05] say God I trust you in every decision
[1:03:08] you make and if this is not of you I
[1:03:11] trust that you'll change this
[1:03:15] situation so now Joseph is is now in
[1:03:18] prison and and then there's two men a
[1:03:20] butler and a baker and they they have
[1:03:22] dreams and he interprets the dream and
[1:03:24] the interpretation comes to pass and he
[1:03:26] tells the one when you're restored don't
[1:03:29] forget me
[1:03:30] buddy like please say a good word to he
[1:03:34] said I'll never forget
[1:03:37] you you're my bud and you you you you
[1:03:40] gave me the interpretation of Dream It's
[1:03:42] coming to pass and as soon as he got out
[1:03:45] of prison he forgot
[1:03:48] Joseph question is how would you
[1:03:51] feel would you go that Butler Baker I
[1:03:55] don't remember which one it
[1:03:56] was after all I did for him and I was
[1:03:59] good to him and he forgot about me come
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] on now if you never had that thought
[1:04:05] you'd come to Perfection
[1:04:08] already and you probably die and go to
[1:04:11] heaven cuz you don't need any more time
[1:04:13] on
[1:04:17] Earth those things roll around in our
[1:04:20] head but we need the spirit of God Amen
[1:04:23] to correct that Human
[1:04:27] Side sometimes we just need to remind
[1:04:29] ourselves who's in
[1:04:32] control that God never fell off his
[1:04:34] throne and bumped his head and got
[1:04:37] amnesia he's in absolute control he's
[1:04:40] still seated at the head of everything
[1:04:43] and he hasn't forgot me and he hasn't
[1:04:45] forgot where I'm at and he and he's not
[1:04:47] unmindful of what I'm going through amen
[1:04:50] sometimes we just need to rehearse these
[1:04:51] things to ourselves to keep us in the
[1:04:53] right frame of mind
[1:04:56] mind so Joseph now is
[1:04:59] forgotten and he's still in
[1:05:06] prison God
[1:05:08] knew that this man in order to fulfill
[1:05:11] the vision had to know how to rule and
[1:05:17] Reign so he started training them in
[1:05:19] Piper's
[1:05:22] house you know what he would have picked
[1:05:24] up in Piper's house potier was an
[1:05:27] Egyptian the Bible's careful to tell us
[1:05:29] he was an Egyptian and he was at a
[1:05:31] captain in the guard do you know what he
[1:05:32] would have picked up in poyer's house
[1:05:34] Egyptian culture Egyptian customers
[1:05:37] Customs Egyptian
[1:05:40] politics cuz he was in the house of a
[1:05:42] high-ranking official he would have
[1:05:44] figured out quickly how things work in
[1:05:50] Egypt you know what he would have picked
[1:05:52] up in prison
[1:05:54] All the
[1:05:55] gossip from the king's Palace because
[1:05:59] the the prison he went to was the one
[1:06:01] where they keep all the king's
[1:06:05] prisoners so he would have picked up all
[1:06:08] the political undercurrents oh
[1:06:12] yeah that was the best training he could
[1:06:15] have ever had to ascend to the right
[1:06:16] hand of
[1:06:17] pharaoh he had seen it on both sides he
[1:06:20] had heard it from both sides and in both
[1:06:22] places he was given responsib ability as
[1:06:24] a ruler to rule and Reign and guide and
[1:06:26] be in control of people and God was
[1:06:29] absolutely working an absolute beautiful
[1:06:32] plan it was probably more perfect than
[1:06:34] we could imagin he probably overheard
[1:06:36] things in that cell and that prison that
[1:06:38] saved him trouble when he got to the
[1:06:42] throne I don't know I but can you
[1:06:46] imagine so God's plan was absolutely
[1:06:50] perfect amen and God's going to work his
[1:06:52] plan in us he's going to have a perfect
[1:06:53] plan and he's going to work it in our
[1:06:55] lives and he's doing the same things
[1:06:56] with us
[1:06:57] today you have to believe that he's
[1:06:59] doing the same things with us today he's
[1:07:02] bringing us in an ordained plan he's
[1:07:04] bringing us an ordained way because he
[1:07:05] has a goal in mind he has an objective
[1:07:08] in mind and he's trying to bring us into
[1:07:09] Christlike character so why so that we
[1:07:12] can rule and reign with
[1:07:14] him and in so doing he's got to put us
[1:07:17] in places and in situations where we
[1:07:19] have to learn how to handle situations
[1:07:21] and we have to hear things and
[1:07:23] experience things and see
[1:07:26] things that we didn't want to hear and
[1:07:28] we didn't want to experience and we
[1:07:30] didn't want to see because we would if
[1:07:31] we planned Our Lives my life would be so
[1:07:34] cream puffed cake eating sweet as honey
[1:07:37] every day of my life I would never learn
[1:07:40] anything if I got to
[1:07:48] pick I'm glad he doesn't let me pick cuz
[1:07:50] I mean I'd still be a little baby on the
[1:07:52] floor kicking and screaming every time
[1:07:55] he didn't answer my prayer
[1:07:57] immediately I'd be throwing a 2-year-old
[1:07:59] temper
[1:08:03] tantrum so God In His abundant goodness
[1:08:06] and Grace he's got an objective in mind
[1:08:09] and everything's moving to that
[1:08:12] objective and faith in that is what
[1:08:15] gives us the right attitude in the midst
[1:08:17] of
[1:08:20] Trials listen we can't get bitter
[1:08:23] because it's better for them than it is
[1:08:25] for
[1:08:28] me you can't get bitter because somebody
[1:08:32] else's situation it looks like God
[1:08:34] blessed them and he didn't bless
[1:08:37] me God's got something else for them
[1:08:40] than he has for
[1:08:42] you you didn't make a mistake you know
[1:08:45] what happens when we get bitter about
[1:08:46] that now we never go around saying I'm
[1:08:49] bitter because I'm
[1:08:50] envious we would we don't say that we're
[1:08:53] Christians we know
[1:08:54] better but that's actually what
[1:08:58] happens so we don't that doesn't come
[1:09:00] out of our mouth and we don't even let
[1:09:01] that float around in our mind we cover
[1:09:03] that up with some other
[1:09:08] excuse I mean we play mental gymnastics
[1:09:10] with ourselves all the
[1:09:14] time
[1:09:17] but but what happens when we do that and
[1:09:21] we begin to compare our life with
[1:09:22] somebody else and we feel feel
[1:09:24] mistreated or left out or somehow
[1:09:26] forgotten
[1:09:28] or really the accusation is against
[1:09:32] God when it gets really down to the
[1:09:35] nitty-gritty our accusation is really
[1:09:38] against
[1:09:40] God because God's in
[1:09:45] control and we may think we're directing
[1:09:47] it towards somebody who's harmed us and
[1:09:49] somebody who's hurt us and but really
[1:09:52] what we're doing is saying God you've
[1:09:54] not done a very good job of taking care
[1:09:56] of me because I'm hurt and I'm wounded
[1:10:00] and I'm negatively affected and now I'm
[1:10:02] justified in my bitterness and I'm
[1:10:04] justified in my nasty attitude and I'm
[1:10:06] Justified at being angry with everybody
[1:10:08] and always in a
[1:10:12] fight instead of just being honest and
[1:10:15] saying God I'm
[1:10:17] destroyed but I need your help I don't
[1:10:21] understand why these things have
[1:10:22] happened in my life I don't understand
[1:10:23] why
[1:10:24] everything seems to work out for others
[1:10:25] but it never works out for me but one
[1:10:27] thing I know is before the foundation of
[1:10:29] the world I was a thought in your mind
[1:10:31] and you know what you're doing and
[1:10:33] forgive me for my attitude Come and Let
[1:10:35] Your Grace be sufficient for
[1:10:38] me sometimes we got to get down and be
[1:10:41] honest and not just keep pretending
[1:10:42] we're okay when we're not okay we need
[1:10:44] to say God I'm not okay I'm I'm bitter
[1:10:48] I'm angry I I have self-pity amen I feel
[1:10:51] sorry for myself and Lord what I need
[1:10:54] you to do is come down and give me the
[1:10:56] faith to recognize that every step I
[1:10:59] take you're aware of you know about it
[1:11:01] there's a definite purpose in my life
[1:11:03] and you're going to bring me to an
[1:11:04] expected End Amen you have thoughts for
[1:11:07] me of good and not of evil right right
[1:11:10] these are the scriptures that concern
[1:11:12] the elect of God we need to rehearse
[1:11:14] these when bad things happen to us amen
[1:11:17] we believe it when good things happen
[1:11:18] but we have to rehearse it when the bad
[1:11:20] things
[1:11:22] happen when sickness comes When Trials
[1:11:26] come when we lose loved ones we didn't
[1:11:28] expect to
[1:11:31] lose what are we going to
[1:11:34] do these are these are the things of
[1:11:37] life that are there to mold us and put
[1:11:40] character into us they're to equip us to
[1:11:44] rule and
[1:11:45] Reign
[1:11:46] amen when people walk away from the
[1:11:50] message we never thought would
[1:11:52] leave people for forsake us that you
[1:11:54] never thought would forsake
[1:11:56] us we evily spoken of we're accused of
[1:12:00] things we haven't
[1:12:01] done when we do wrong things and have
[1:12:05] wrong result all of these
[1:12:07] things we have to come back to the
[1:12:10] reality God you know the way that I take
[1:12:14] and when I am tried I shall come forth
[1:12:15] as gold why because that was his plan
[1:12:18] all along nothing has changed his plan
[1:12:22] let's turn to Acts 14 together I want to
[1:12:24] read through a couple scriptures and
[1:12:26] look at something here in the in the
[1:12:28] word before we
[1:12:42] leave Acts
[1:12:50] 14:21 says and when they had preached
[1:12:52] the gospel to that City and had taught
[1:12:54] many they returned again to lisan to
[1:12:56] ionium and to Antioch confirming the
[1:12:59] souls of the disciples and exhorting
[1:13:01] them to continue in the faith and that
[1:13:03] we must through much tribulation enter
[1:13:06] into the kingdom of God so how do we
[1:13:08] enter into the kingdom of God through
[1:13:10] much
[1:13:12] tribulation so that should be our
[1:13:15] expectation this word tribulation is a
[1:13:18] Greek word and I won't even try to
[1:13:21] pronounce it but the definition that
[1:13:23] gives at the bottom is a pressing
[1:13:26] pressing together pressure oppression
[1:13:30] Affliction tribulation distress or
[1:13:34] Straits so what how must we enter into
[1:13:37] the kingdom of God through
[1:13:40] pressure through oppression Affliction
[1:13:44] tribulation distress Straits what is it
[1:13:47] the whole world caving in on you yeah
[1:13:50] amen things going wrong pressures coming
[1:13:54] troubles and trials and this is how we
[1:13:56] enter into the
[1:13:58] kingdom I want to look at uh uh just a
[1:14:00] couple more places here let's go to
[1:14:02] Romans chapter
[1:14:05] 5 we'll turn quickly to a couple
[1:14:08] scriptures Romans chapter 5 verse
[1:14:18] 1 5 and one therefore being justified by
[1:14:22] faith we have peace with God through our
[1:14:23] Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have
[1:14:26] access by faith and the grace wherein we
[1:14:28] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[1:14:30] glory of God and not only so but we
[1:14:32] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[1:14:35] tribulation worketh patience and
[1:14:36] patience experience and experience hope
[1:14:40] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[1:14:42] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:14:43] by the Holy Ghost which is given to
[1:14:46] us this word tribulation is the same one
[1:14:49] we just went through in the previous
[1:14:51] verse oppressed
[1:14:55] anguish
[1:14:58] tribulation and by
[1:15:00] tribulation we glory in Tribulation
[1:15:03] because tribulation worketh patience
[1:15:06] let's go to James chapter 1
[1:15:15] quickly James chapter
[1:15:18] 1 verse
[1:15:22] two
[1:15:23] my brethren count it all joy when you
[1:15:26] fall into diverse Temptations knowing
[1:15:28] this that the trying of your faith
[1:15:30] worketh patience but let patience have
[1:15:31] her perfect work that you may be perfect
[1:15:34] and entire wanting
[1:15:37] nothing I hope we can see by the
[1:15:39] scriptures that trials and tribulations
[1:15:41] and pressures and squeezes they're just
[1:15:44] a part of life amen there's no way to
[1:15:48] avoid them in fact the constant attempt
[1:15:50] to avoid them and then the mental
[1:15:53] distress and the the the the the anger
[1:15:56] and the frustration we have by not
[1:15:57] avoiding them is actually causing us
[1:15:59] more trouble than the trial
[1:16:01] itself sometimes what we need to do is
[1:16:03] just put our head down like a mule and
[1:16:06] plow we'll be done with it before we can
[1:16:09] quit
[1:16:11] fussing right it'll be over with and
[1:16:13] we'll be on the other side of the trial
[1:16:15] amen and we won't get on the other side
[1:16:16] of the trial with all of the regrets and
[1:16:18] all of the repentance and all of the
[1:16:20] having to make things right for what we
[1:16:22] said and did to our family members and
[1:16:23] those that were around
[1:16:26] us we won't have to go make things right
[1:16:28] with our co-workers and we won't have to
[1:16:30] if we would just sometimes just put our
[1:16:32] head down and just plow and say God you
[1:16:35] know what's best and when I am tried I
[1:16:38] shall come forth as gold you know what's
[1:16:40] right you know what's wrong you know
[1:16:42] what's being said right you know what's
[1:16:43] being said wrong you know what's being
[1:16:44] done right you know what's being done
[1:16:46] wrong and I trust you who's the
[1:16:48] righteous judge of all Heaven and Earth
[1:16:49] to judge righteously for my case right
[1:16:51] now right now and if you see fit to
[1:16:54] allow this to happen to me then this is
[1:16:56] the direction that I want to take Amen
[1:17:00] on
[1:17:01] Amen sometimes we become our own
[1:17:04] Advocate and we forget we have an
[1:17:08] advocate in the message the world is
[1:17:10] falling apart brother B says we want
[1:17:11] everything just everything so we can
[1:17:13] take it easy and retire and take life
[1:17:17] easy if that's ever been a true
[1:17:19] statement that's a true statement for me
[1:17:22] you and I you know what I want to do I
[1:17:24] want to become a professional
[1:17:26] fisherman but not one that actually has
[1:17:28] to catch fish to keep his profession
[1:17:30] like I just want to go try and get
[1:17:35] paid this is what he says everything we
[1:17:38] want everything so we can take it easy
[1:17:41] and retire and take life
[1:17:44] easy said life wasn't intended to be
[1:17:47] easy life is a
[1:17:51] struggle amen anything that's got life
[1:17:54] is a
[1:17:55] struggle look at the trees how they
[1:17:57] struggle look at everything that's got
[1:17:58] life it's a struggle and we we try to
[1:18:00] get some kind of system that takes it
[1:18:02] easy then we're wrong and we know that
[1:18:05] there's something
[1:18:08] wrong you know we paint the American
[1:18:11] dream you work hard for 30 years you
[1:18:13] save for retirement and blah blah blah
[1:18:16] then you retire you golf every day and
[1:18:19] the sun's always shining and nothing in
[1:18:21] your house breaks
[1:18:25] because you're not working now so
[1:18:27] everything's
[1:18:30] fine you know what it's a carrot on a
[1:18:34] stick you work all your life work work
[1:18:37] work safe safe safe safe safe safe and
[1:18:39] and say you do get enough amount of
[1:18:40] money that you don't have to go to work
[1:18:42] anymore that won't give you good
[1:18:44] health amen that also won't give you a
[1:18:47] good solid
[1:18:49] family that also won't end any of your
[1:18:51] troubles right
[1:18:54] it's the carrot on the
[1:18:57] stick when there's going to be struggles
[1:18:59] and suffers all along before retirement
[1:19:03] during retirement postretirement when
[1:19:06] you have to go back to work cuz it
[1:19:07] wasn't like what you thought it
[1:19:10] was you're going to have struggles all
[1:19:13] along yes right you get enough money
[1:19:16] that money is not a struggle you have
[1:19:18] struggles with your health if you don't
[1:19:20] have struggles with your health you have
[1:19:21] struggles with your family you don't
[1:19:23] have struggles with your family you have
[1:19:24] struggles at church there's going to be
[1:19:26] a
[1:19:27] struggle might as well resolve ourselves
[1:19:30] to struggle well to do a good job in the
[1:19:32] struggle to be like Joseph amen and not
[1:19:35] like Cain Cain killed his brother amen
[1:19:37] Cain did unrighteous and he killed his
[1:19:39] brother and when God came to to correct
[1:19:41] him on it he started fussing about the
[1:19:43] correction and feeling sorry for himself
[1:19:45] and having self-pity and got angry and
[1:19:47] contentious with almighty
[1:19:49] God when he was God was being so
[1:19:52] merciful to let him
[1:19:54] survive and then to put a mark upon him
[1:19:56] that nobody would kill him and he he
[1:19:58] he's contentious and he's angry and he's
[1:20:00] bitter and he's lying to God I don't
[1:20:02] want to be like Cain I want to be like
[1:20:05] Joseph I want to be like
[1:20:10] Jesus job said in job 14:1 he said man
[1:20:14] that is born of a woman is a few days
[1:20:17] and full of
[1:20:18] trouble guess what your retirement plan
[1:20:20] is not going to change that no
[1:20:24] amen nothing's going to change that amen
[1:20:27] that's life you know what'll change that
[1:20:30] new heavens and new
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:33] earth and we're destined for that so
[1:20:36] praise
[1:20:37] God let's go to John 16
[1:20:48] together John
[1:20:51] 16 and let's go to vers verse
[1:20:56] 33 John
[1:20:58] 16:33 these things have I spoken unto
[1:21:00] you that in me you might have peace in
[1:21:03] the world ye shall have
[1:21:06] tribulation listen if Jesus said it it's
[1:21:09] a promise just the same promises I'll be
[1:21:11] with you until the end of the world Amen
[1:21:14] so you can Bank on it in the world you
[1:21:16] shall have tribulation but be of good
[1:21:18] cheer cheer I have overcome the world
[1:21:20] hallelujah amen now now this word
[1:21:23] tribulation is the same one that we've
[1:21:24] been looking at in the previous two
[1:21:25] verses oppressing oppress oppression
[1:21:29] Affliction tribulation distress Straits
[1:21:32] now let's go to Matthew 7 and we're
[1:21:33] going to see the word again only it's
[1:21:35] translated
[1:21:37] differently but I want to see in its
[1:21:39] application
[1:21:42] here Matthew chapter
[1:21:46] 7 verse
[1:21:49] 13 we're going to read verse 13 and 14
[1:21:52] of Matthew chap chap 7 enter ye in at
[1:21:55] the Straight Gate for wide is the gate
[1:21:57] and Broad is the way that leadth to
[1:21:58] destruction and many there be which go
[1:22:01] there at because straight is the gate
[1:22:03] and narrow is the way which leadth unto
[1:22:05] life and few there be that find
[1:22:08] it it says straight is the gate and
[1:22:11] narrow is the way that word straight
[1:22:14] just means
[1:22:15] narrow so when I looked up straight and
[1:22:17] it said narrow I said well why would it
[1:22:19] say narrow is the gate and narrow is the
[1:22:22] way well this word narrow most every
[1:22:25] other time in the Bible is translated
[1:22:28] tribulation and in the previous three
[1:22:30] verses we read when Jesus said in this
[1:22:32] life you shall have tribulation this is
[1:22:34] the this isn't the same word this is the
[1:22:36] root of that word or the verb of that
[1:22:38] word with it comes from the same word
[1:22:41] and here's what it means narrow to press
[1:22:45] as
[1:22:46] grapes press hard upon to compress to be
[1:22:51] contracted metaphorically to trouble to
[1:22:55] afflict to
[1:22:57] distress so straight is the gate and
[1:23:00] narrow this kind of narrow is the way
[1:23:03] which leadth them life and few there be
[1:23:06] that find it God why are there few that
[1:23:08] find it because there's so many that
[1:23:11] don't want to go the way of press
[1:23:14] Affliction they don't want to be
[1:23:15] squeezed like the
[1:23:17] grapes they don't want to be pressed
[1:23:19] hard upon they don't want to they don't
[1:23:21] want to be contracted they don't want
[1:23:22] the metaphorical meaning of to trouble
[1:23:24] to afflict or to distress so they try to
[1:23:26] take the wide way to bypass this way but
[1:23:30] this is the way to
[1:23:33] life you enter into the kingdom through
[1:23:36] much tribulation straight is the gate
[1:23:38] and narrow is the way which leadth into
[1:23:40] life and few that be there be that find
[1:23:42] it why because there's very few that
[1:23:44] says Lord is this the way I have to walk
[1:23:46] Amen to get to you then that's the way
[1:23:48] I'm going to walk that's the way I want
[1:23:51] to walk
[1:23:54] there's very few that have a resolve to
[1:23:58] suffer and in the Old Testament in the
[1:24:00] Book of Daniel when we know the story of
[1:24:03] the fiery furnace and the three Hebrew
[1:24:05] children but I love what they said they
[1:24:07] they they were they were nice to the
[1:24:08] king they said oh King live live forever
[1:24:11] we can't we can't do what you
[1:24:13] say and our God is more than able to
[1:24:16] deliver us and he will deliver us out of
[1:24:17] your hand but even if he
[1:24:21] doesn't Will Not Bow you know what they
[1:24:24] had a resolve to
[1:24:26] suffer they were willing to go through
[1:24:28] the fiery furnace to stay with the word
[1:24:30] but they weren't getting bitter angry
[1:24:34] they weren't spitting a
[1:24:37] insults towards the king they weren't
[1:24:40] saying you wait till God gets you for
[1:24:42] what you're doing
[1:24:44] no none of that they conducted
[1:24:47] themselves as sons of the king amen amen
[1:24:52] we know know that God delivered
[1:24:54] them in the church age book brother
[1:24:57] benam makes this
[1:24:59] statement and he he says there is a gold
[1:25:01] of God it goes from 1 Peter 1:7 that the
[1:25:04] trial of your faith being much more
[1:25:06] precious than gold that perisheth said
[1:25:08] the gold of God is a Christlike
[1:25:10] character produced in the fiery furnace
[1:25:11] of Affliction that is the right kind of
[1:25:14] gold but what kind of gold does the
[1:25:16] church have today it has but the worldly
[1:25:18] gold that will perish it is Rich it is
[1:25:20] complacent it has made affluence and the
[1:25:23] the major Criterion of spirituality the
[1:25:25] evidence of God's blessing and the
[1:25:26] correctness of Doctrine is now based
[1:25:28] upon how many Rich folks are involved in
[1:25:31] it you'd had better come before it's too
[1:25:33] late sayith the Lord and buy of me gold
[1:25:35] tried in the fire and then you will be
[1:25:37] truly Rich are we getting it listen to
[1:25:39] me naked physically we came into the
[1:25:42] world but naked spiritually we will not
[1:25:43] leave it oh no we are going to take
[1:25:45] something with us what that something is
[1:25:47] is all we can take with us nothing less
[1:25:50] nothing more so we had better better be
[1:25:52] real careful now to see that we take
[1:25:55] something that will make us right before
[1:25:57] God so then what will we take with us we
[1:26:00] will take our character brother that is
[1:26:02] what we will take with us now what kind
[1:26:04] of ter character will you take with you
[1:26:06] will it be will it be his whose
[1:26:09] character was molded by suffering in the
[1:26:10] fiery furnace of Affliction or will it
[1:26:13] be the softness of this characterless
[1:26:15] leoan people it is up to each one of us
[1:26:18] for in that day every man will bear his
[1:26:20] own burden what kind of character do you
[1:26:23] want to take the character list
[1:26:26] leoan that's what we're immersed
[1:26:29] in yes no one wants to suffer no one
[1:26:32] thinks they should suffer right
[1:26:36] amen politicians stay in their position
[1:26:40] by removing everyone's
[1:26:43] suffering until no one suffer and now
[1:26:46] when no one's suffering everybody's
[1:26:51] suffering because nobody wants to
[1:26:54] suffer and the message I
[1:26:57] know brother says why does God let
[1:26:59] troubles come God harnesses trouble many
[1:27:03] of you I've told this for years you know
[1:27:05] this I've quoted this from this Pulpit
[1:27:07] many many times this is probably my
[1:27:09] favorite quote in all the
[1:27:11] message why does God let troubles come
[1:27:14] God harnesses trouble puts bits in its
[1:27:15] mouth and makes it obey him and those
[1:27:18] troubles bring us into a closer
[1:27:20] fellowship with God Amen
[1:27:22] how many times have we prayed for a
[1:27:24] closer walk with
[1:27:26] God he said there had been no rainbow
[1:27:28] until the flood came but after Noah was
[1:27:31] pressed into that condition that he was
[1:27:32] in to float 40 days and nights in a
[1:27:34] storm the little Ark pitching up and
[1:27:36] down in the water it was after the flood
[1:27:38] was over that he saw the rainbow for its
[1:27:40] first time the Covenant of Hope the
[1:27:42] Covenant of Promise after he' went
[1:27:44] through the tribulation then he saw the
[1:27:46] promise that's the way you see the
[1:27:48] Promise after you've gone through the
[1:27:50] tribulation I've liked that PO po or
[1:27:52] Psalm must I be carried home to heaven
[1:27:54] on a flowery bed of ease While others
[1:27:56] fought to win the prize and sail through
[1:27:58] bloody
[1:27:58] Seas this is the part that's my favorite
[1:28:02] we ask for comfort and peace God gives
[1:28:05] us the best he could give us trials and
[1:28:08] tribulations that's better than comfort
[1:28:10] and peace our Comforts is just beyond
[1:28:14] the
[1:28:15] river why are we going through the
[1:28:18] troubles to have the character when we
[1:28:20] get beyond the river
[1:28:22] our comfort is just beyond the
[1:28:24] river I think we need to stop expecting
[1:28:27] Paradise here and start looking for
[1:28:29] Paradise
[1:28:33] there America's falling
[1:28:36] apart I mean it's been falling apart
[1:28:38] brother R told us it was falling apart
[1:28:41] and it's it's it's rapidly falling apart
[1:28:44] right before our eyes there is no
[1:28:46] security in
[1:28:48] finances there's no security in
[1:28:50] government there's no security
[1:28:52] anywhere there's only Security in
[1:28:57] Christ it's going I mean what happens if
[1:29:00] we lose it all tomorrow well if we lose
[1:29:04] everything tomorrow I've lost
[1:29:07] nothing because we've been placing
[1:29:09] Treasures in Heaven where neither moth
[1:29:11] do corrupt or rust do corrupt amen our
[1:29:14] Treasures our Comforts are just beyond
[1:29:16] the river and nothing can be lost there
[1:29:19] and if I've got to pass through a little
[1:29:21] difficult time here to get there then
[1:29:23] then so be it God's got a purpose in it
[1:29:25] and I need to gain some more
[1:29:27] character
[1:29:30] am amen I want to I want to well I want
[1:29:33] to read two more verses if I can read
[1:29:35] two more as we close let's go to Hebrews
[1:29:40] 13 Hebrews 13 I'm going to read this and
[1:29:42] then one more
[1:29:48] scripture Hebrews
[1:29:50] 13:12
[1:29:58] Hebrews chapter 13 verse2 wherefore
[1:30:01] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[1:30:03] people with his own blood suffered
[1:30:05] without the gate let us go therefore
[1:30:08] unto him without the camp bearing his
[1:30:11] reproach that means willing to suffer
[1:30:14] for his name bearing his reproach for
[1:30:17] here we have no continuing City but we
[1:30:20] seek one to come
[1:30:23] there's nothing here for us if we lose
[1:30:26] it all we have no continuing City let's
[1:30:30] go over to First
[1:30:32] Peter just a few books over to the right
[1:30:36] First Peter chapter
[1:30:42] 5 verse 10 1 Peter 5 and
[1:30:47] 10 but the God of all Grace who have
[1:30:50] called us into his eternal glory by by
[1:30:52] Jesus Christ after that you have
[1:30:54] suffered a while make you perfect
[1:30:57] established strengthened settle you when
[1:31:02] after You' suffered a
[1:31:07] while I want to be I want to be perfect
[1:31:10] established strengthened
[1:31:12] settled you'll get there after you
[1:31:15] suffered a
[1:31:17] while cuz that's the
[1:31:20] plan I say God help
[1:31:22] us I believe we're in the age of
[1:31:26] adoption you know Jesus went to
[1:31:30] Gethsemane after
[1:31:31] adoption after Mount
[1:31:33] Transfiguration that right so even in
[1:31:36] the age of
[1:31:37] adoption we have to learn to resolve
[1:31:40] ourselves to
[1:31:41] suffer to give in the will of God to
[1:31:45] keep the right attitude the right
[1:31:46] approach the right Focus there's a
[1:31:49] certain maturity that the bride has got
[1:31:52] to come
[1:31:53] to and we cannot be throwing temper
[1:31:59] tantrums when we hit
[1:32:02] trials there there's going to be a
[1:32:05] people on this Earth that's going to
[1:32:06] reflect his character amen and it's not
[1:32:09] that they're not going to have distress
[1:32:12] because after adoption he came into
[1:32:13] anguish of spirit he come into sore he
[1:32:16] was sorely
[1:32:18] distressed he prayed in anguish until he
[1:32:21] SW it as it were great drops of blood it
[1:32:23] wasn't that he didn't have anxiety and
[1:32:25] he didn't have pressure and he didn't
[1:32:26] feel the pressure and he didn't have
[1:32:28] great
[1:32:29] distress he had all of
[1:32:31] that but what he did with it and the way
[1:32:34] he reacted to it is showing what an
[1:32:36] adopted son of godone acts
[1:32:39] like it's not that we don't come to the
[1:32:42] end of our wits it's not that we don't
[1:32:44] come to a trial that's beyond our
[1:32:46] ability it's not that we don't we don't
[1:32:48] ask God to remove the situation and
[1:32:50] change it for us it's not that we don't
[1:32:52] have great anguish and severe sorrow and
[1:32:54] are so perplexed and so Disturbed and so
[1:32:57] distressed that we have no idea what to
[1:32:59] do we we've hit that many times we hit
[1:33:02] it many more times but what we need to
[1:33:04] do is exactly what Jesus did and said
[1:33:06] God let this cup pass please rescue me
[1:33:08] from this situation but if not thy will
[1:33:11] be done not my will be done and give me
[1:33:14] the grace to stand up to it
[1:33:17] Lord let me act like your son in the
[1:33:20] midst of this trial yes amen I so want
[1:33:24] to be able to reflect that life in my
[1:33:29] life uh God is going to have a victory
[1:33:32] on this Earth amen he absolutely is
[1:33:35] going and and brother brandham said his
[1:33:39] life in her is his victory amen the
[1:33:43] resurrected life in the bride is the
[1:33:45] purpose for his death and it's his
[1:33:47] victory amen so he is going to have
[1:33:51] victory ictory on this Earth amen and
[1:33:53] where is he going to have Victory he's
[1:33:55] going to have it in his bride and how is
[1:33:57] he going to have it she's going to
[1:33:59] reflect his
[1:34:01] life I say God you can start right
[1:34:04] here I need an extra dose of your help I
[1:34:08] need an extra dose of your grace that is
[1:34:10] sufficient for me I need that same
[1:34:13] sufficient Grace that was sufficient to
[1:34:14] carry Paul I need that same sufficient
[1:34:16] Grace sufficient enough to carry me cuz
[1:34:19] I'm failing In My Own Strength but I can
[1:34:21] never fail in your strength for when I'm
[1:34:24] weak your strength is made perfect in my
[1:34:29] weakness sometimes we just need to be
[1:34:31] resolved to go through the trial yes
[1:34:35] stop
[1:34:37] fussing stop complaining stop
[1:34:40] blaming stop conniving stop
[1:34:44] manipulating and just start
[1:34:48] walking I think for us I think if we're
[1:34:52] able to take that attitude and approach
[1:34:55] I think we'll be
[1:34:56] surprised at how quickly we come through
[1:34:59] a
[1:34:59] trial and I think we might be
[1:35:02] surprised how it was so much easier than
[1:35:06] we
[1:35:08] thought why because with that attitude
[1:35:10] and with that resolve it's not you
[1:35:12] walking through the trial it's his grace
[1:35:14] that's sufficient for
[1:35:16] you it's not like you get to the end of
[1:35:18] the trial and say that was easy now you
[1:35:21] get to the tri you say thank you God you
[1:35:25] carried me through and it was so
[1:35:27] much better than I expected it was so
[1:35:31] much different than what I anticipated I
[1:35:34] had dread and I had anguish but when I
[1:35:36] surrendered Your Grace was sufficient
[1:35:38] and your strength was made perfect in my
[1:35:40] weakness and I come through the trial
[1:35:42] and and I L Lord help us I want to come
[1:35:45] to the place where I quit causing myself
[1:35:48] extra trouble in my
[1:35:50] trouble
[1:35:52] yes I have caused myself so much stress
[1:35:57] so much depression so much anger and
[1:35:59] frustration and so much regrets why
[1:36:02] because of me it wasn't the trial it was
[1:36:05] me it was my reaction to the trial it
[1:36:08] was my attitude towards the trial it was
[1:36:10] the things I said and the things I did
[1:36:12] and that I caused myself more trouble
[1:36:15] than the trial was actually going to
[1:36:16] cause
[1:36:19] me true amen
[1:36:22] you know what I want the next time he
[1:36:24] hands me a multiplication
[1:36:27] table I just want to start working on
[1:36:32] it instead of looking around the room
[1:36:34] and seeing if everybody else is mad like
[1:36:35] I'm
[1:36:39] mad see if anybody else agrees with me
[1:36:41] that this is
[1:36:45] unfair how much energy do we exert
[1:36:48] wasting time instead of just getting
[1:36:50] down to business
[1:36:53] yes praise God say God help me next time
[1:36:56] you give me a 10-page research
[1:37:00] paper I just want to start writing down
[1:37:02] the
[1:37:03] outline page
[1:37:06] one not fight it not resist it not blame
[1:37:11] anybody not get bitter or angry but God
[1:37:15] make your grace sufficient for me and in
[1:37:19] my weakness would your strength be made
[1:37:22] perfect I'm moving forward Lord would
[1:37:25] you help
[1:37:26] me I think you'll
[1:37:29] find with that attitude you'll never
[1:37:32] pass through a trial
[1:37:34] alone amen there'll be somebody with
[1:37:39] you let's all
[1:37:41] stand musicians if you'll come and
[1:37:43] brother Blake if you'll please
[1:37:49] come I don't know when I'll finally grow
[1:37:54] up
[1:37:56] spiritually but I know if I'm on if I'm
[1:38:00] here at the time of the body change
[1:38:03] he'll see to it that I
[1:38:05] am I don't know when it will happen and
[1:38:07] I don't know what it'll look like but I
[1:38:09] know one thing I'm not what I
[1:38:14] was and what what what is it that has
[1:38:18] changed all of us from what we are what
[1:38:20] we were to we are
[1:38:22] now it's the word of
[1:38:24] God but you know what's made that word
[1:38:27] real our trials and
[1:38:30] tribulations you know what's made the
[1:38:32] word so relevant and so real and so
[1:38:35] pertinent is because of the things that
[1:38:38] we went
[1:38:39] through the word of God has changed us
[1:38:43] and our trials have shaped
[1:38:45] us and I say thank you
[1:38:48] God and if that's what it took to get
[1:38:51] here I wonder what it will take to
[1:38:53] finish the
[1:38:55] job probably
[1:38:59] retirement I don't think so I don't
[1:39:02] think take more of the same maybe a lot
[1:39:05] more of the same maybe a degree which we
[1:39:07] haven't faced yet but praise God he will
[1:39:12] have his victory on this Earth and he
[1:39:16] will have it in human flesh and he will
[1:39:19] have it in a fallen redeemed human in
[1:39:21] flesh that is called his bride and it'll
[1:39:23] be the many membered bride of Jesus
[1:39:25] Christ and she will stand the trial she
[1:39:27] will go like Jesus did silent to the
[1:39:31] slaughter praise God not defending
[1:39:34] herself not manipulating not blaming not
[1:39:37] ridiculing but just silently walking for
[1:39:40] with confidence that my father knows the
[1:39:42] way that I take and when I am tried I
[1:39:45] shall come forth as
[1:39:46] golden praise God God bless you all
[1:39:49] let's bow our heads together and pray
[1:39:52] dear Lord Jesus I thank you
[1:39:55] Father for God we need you Lord now more
[1:39:58] than

[1:40:05] been and God we realize that if it
[1:40:07] wasn't for you Lord we would have never
[1:40:09] made it one step not one step towards
[1:40:12] your kingdom could we have made on our
[1:40:13] own not one thing could we accomplish
[1:40:16] Lord without your spirit if it wasn't
[1:40:19] for your predestinated plan for your WR
[1:40:21] and wooing for the word that you've
[1:40:22] given in this hour to mold us and shape
[1:40:24] us we would have never made it this
[1:40:28] far God I pray that you would give us a
[1:40:31] determination
[1:40:33] Lord to give you first place and
