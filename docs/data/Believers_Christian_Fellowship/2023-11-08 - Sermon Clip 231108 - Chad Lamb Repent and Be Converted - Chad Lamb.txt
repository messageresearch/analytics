TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he finds out that the one that he had been persecuting he thought they were people that had a false religion and a false idea and were ruining the the Bible yeah when he come to find out in that encounter that he was persecuting Jesus Christ himself who is living in those people amen and now his whole world changes amen does he come to repentance he absolutely comes to repentance cuz his whole thinking changed when he gets up from that experience he can't even see to walk he has to be led by the hand into the City and he's led by the hand into the city the Bible says he lays there for three days with no sight and no food I wonder what he thought about for three days I wonder how many things he regretted for 3 days I wonder with this Revelation that just hit him as a literal light out of Heaven changed his whole world his whole Paradigm all his understanding and you know when it all changed it left him humble and broken it wasn't flippant it wasn't oh yeah I see that I'll take no it wrecked his universe amen yeah yeah this is why brother B says in one place I doubt a dry-eyed confession it's not that you have to cry to be converted that's that's not what he's saying but back in his day there was so many decisions for Christ and raising your hand if you agree and you want to be saved and and and fill out a card or come forward and repeat after me prayer amen but there was there was none of this Brokenness none of this weeping bitterly none of this realizing I'm not what I thought I was I thought I was a Christian but I'm not really a Christian I thought I was a message believer but I see now I'm not really got the change that I was projecting to other people because inside I have no power to overcome that's not something to take lightly that's not something to move on Beyond we don't keep pretending we don't keep moving on in our own Pride amen we need to come to a weeping bitterly we need to come to a place when we're flat on our back broken and humiliated with a couple days to think about it and I'm sure he was thinking about how could I been so wrong how could I missed it and I'm sure he was thinking about Steven stoning amen amen sometimes what we need is to realize we're not what we thought we were Lord and we need a bit of humility and Brokenness and some weeping some Contrition some quiet time to sit and say God you've got to help me because I can't help myself what we don't need to do is just keep moving on and hope everything works out
