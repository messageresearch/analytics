TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there's so many times friends that we cannot accurately discern ourselves because we're deceived by our own human emotions by our own carnal heart and we think we've got the right motives we think listen when brother branham was going to go up on the alaskan highway up in northern british columbia amen he made religious excuses for going and he was going up there because he was a prophet of god and prophets of god they don't mingle with the people they don't do all this they go out in the wilderness and god gives a message they stomp out and they deliver their message and they go back and and all of a sudden he was deceiving himself it was his own wicked heart coming up with that plan and in the plan he was using scriptural types he was using he was using the bible he was using religious notions to justify his own actions listen you're not even safe amen if you have the bible you're not even safe from this kind of self-deception if you're holding a bible in your hand or reading in the bible reading the message but you're still not safe from self-deception because a man's heart is is desperately wicked that's why to have the white wig one among us is the greatest privilege we could ever have to have a judge that knows that heart and knows the word and can reveal the word and bring the solution to the problem and expose what's going on and bring the word upon the subject that's the greatest thing that we could experience we don't know how blessed we are and how thankful we are that there's the righteous judge of all heaven and earth the supreme judge is here amen the white wigged one is here the book has been opened the word is present and there's a loving god who wants to marry you amen but marrying you he's got to keep you in the right condition so that he can stay married to you to take you out of here and he will keep you right at all costs what a privilege to have the judge in our midst
