========================================

oh we're a band of christian soldiers fighting satan every day we're standing up for jesus while we're kneeling down to pray if his precious blood has cleansed you and washed your sins away that makes you a member of the blood wash man praise god i'm a member of the blood wash man i've been washed in that soul cleansing blood of the land i was bound by chains of sin till one day the master came and made god's children are advancing marching till we reach the goal for this battle's almost over and we'll soon be going home praise till one day the master [Applause] [Music] i've a member of the blood washband amen well greater is he that is in me greater is he that is greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world well satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and from seeking who he may devour the bible tells me so many souls have been his prey to fall in some weekend but god has given us today his overcoming power oh greater is he that that is in me than he that is in the world and on that day of pentecost a rushing mighty way blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power greater than any earthly food and i'm so glad i've got it too i'm gonna let the whole world know well greater is he that is he that is in the world one more time [Music] [Music] we want to see [Music] to jesus out and touch [Music] and say that we love [Music] oh and help us [Music] see [Music] amen praise god how many came to see him how many expect to see him the prophet of god told us you get what you come expecting amen and so we want to expect to see him and then we're going to go right into our tape service now we're going to play this tape thank you musicians appreciate all you do for us amen um let's just go ahead and have our seats as we prepare here and prepare ourselves i want to make a quick note and let you remind all of you if you haven't been made aware that the time changes this weekend so we'll be springing forward moving our clocks up this saturday night and so that's always a good sign that warm weather is coming so praise the lord amen so it seems like just like last month we moved it back time's going so fast but here we are again so now we've come to this tape service we we've been doing this at least once a year for the last i think four years i think this is the fourth year we've done it and maybe a little wrong on that but i believe that's where we're at and the reason i started doing this originally and the reason i continue to do it is because we've always got uh those in our midst who are coming up who are who either who are raised in the message and are starting to get a hold of it for themselves and our youth and our children some who who are new or some who have just started to really committing themselves to the lord and and i do this for a couple of reasons one one reason is because i i i want to demonstrate to our children and to our young people and anybody else who can benefit from that how to really feed on the word not to just play a tape as background noise but really do how to dig in and glean from that message something that god is trying to share with us in this day so it's not just a tape that you play as noise in the background but it's actually a message god is trying to get to his children and how do we dig in and receive that message from the lord so that's one of the reasons i do that and i've also found that it's really refreshing for the whole assembly amen that we listen to this together because we we we benefit together being in the same place and listening to the same thing at the same time and it's really it's always been really refreshing for me and i've always really enjoyed that and i always want to remind you too just because we're playing a tape and following along in the book it doesn't mean that we have to be quiet amen we still want to respond to the word and if something strikes your heart shout amen amen praise the lord and clap your hands whatever strikes you whatever stimulation comes from the revelation let it be expressed in the way that god expresses through you so the the service or the message that we're going to take today is the message it is the rising of the sun i hope you all have a book if you didn't get a chance to get this book there's a iraq out by the welcome desk and the foyer and the deacons brother dave has some too and so if you and brother steve do you have any so if you need one and you can just raise your hand and one of these brothers will get you a book if you didn't get a chance to get one or they're out there you can feel free to slip back there and get them and brother drier has some as well so we do this i we order quite a few books because i like to follow along in the book my favorite way to listen to a message is to follow along my favorite is to read amen and to follow along with the tape but i do this every time i go through this for for all of us but especially for our youth whenever i pick up a message book whether it be in book form or or even on the tablet or on your phone uh and the table form the app what i want to know first is i want to know when did bro first i want to know the title so what is the title and what does this title mean and this title is it is the rising of the sun and this is amazing title because brother branham is not talking about he's not he's not phrasing this in past tense neither is he phrasing it in future tense but the phrasing of this message is in present tense that it is the rising of the sun and just by that title alone i start to build some anticipation in my heart for what he's going to say because this is something that's pertinent to me today that it is the rising of the sun not it will be or it was but it is today the rising of the sun so right away our mind goes to the right spot and anticipation begins to build in my heart and now i'm eager to hear what the prophet of god has to say about it is the rising of the sun then i look at the date and in your book it's in the upper left hand corner and it's in it's always in the format of year first then month then day so it's 65-0418 which o4 is the month april 18th is the 18th day of the month and then there's a little m behind this one and that means morning that means on that particular sunday they had two messages this is the morning message if you're looking on your the table whether it be tablet or phone and you search for your title and you pull it up it'll be there on the left hand side and it will tell you the title it'll below that give you the date in the same format 65-0418-m to the right it will tell you the duration how long the message is and where it was preached but in the book if you open up not not to the first covered page but to the second page and on the inside of the second page in the small print down on the left hand side it there's there's it'll tell you that this is the rising of the sun it gives you the same format for the for the date but then down in the paragraph it says this message by brother william mary and branham was delivered on sunday morning april 18 1965 at the branham tabernacle in jeffersonville indiana usa the tape number 65-0418 m is two hours and 24 minutes so i i this is just something i do i look at that i want to know how long it is i want to know where he preached it uh because because brother branham sometimes will change the way he addresses a crowd in different places and so i want to know where he's at and why maybe he phrases things the way he phrases them amen but when he's in jeffersonville at home he phrases it much differently sometimes i also want to know where in the ministry is he in 1965 we know that he goes off the scene in the end of 1965 so here he is at the end of his ministry this is after the church ages from 1960 after the seals from 1963 and here he is in the on the home stretch of his ministry and i want to know that too so i want to know where it's at in the timeline of his ministry and the timeline of events where he preached the sermon and what the title of the sermon is and i want to hold that title in my mind the whole time so i don't want to just get it first and then drop it because i want to know that what he's preaching about is it is the rising of the sun from the beginning to the end so that's how we go there so as we usually do uh i have questions and so i do this so we will all stay tuned in as we go along because as we listen to the tape brother branham will answer all of these questions but i finally had an epiphany and i decided to put them up on a powerpoint so we can all read them together and i don't know how that hit me but somebody must have been praying because this is always the hard part i move too fast and you don't write fast enough so the first question is what is the subject so we know what the title is but the question is what is the subject and and brother branham will answer all of these and i don't there's no tricks here these are no trick questions i put them in chronological order as you'll come in contact with them as we listen to the message today so what is the subject we know the title but what is the subject next why does satan not care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine this is a good one why does satan not care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine i get excited just reading the questions why does satan not care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine number three how did brother branham get his text in his subject for this message this is another good one that i very much enjoy how did brother branham get his text and his subject for this message and he'll tell you very plainly all right number three how did brother branham get his text and his subject for this message all right in number four what does the sun son rise for what does the sun rise for or what is the purpose of the sunrise s-o-n sunrise so we'll hear that as well all right number four what does the sun rise for and number five what are we quickened from number five what are we quickened from all these are very very good brother brahm goes into this there's much more he says but these are just some points that i wanted to bring out and that we can follow along on so number five what are we quick and from now if you open your book or you turn on your tablet your phone we're going to begin right for paragraph one and brother ben right out the onset here he gets into some good stuff and we want to start from paragraph one but if you will take your bibles i want to go ahead and read the the scriptures that brother benham reads to to form the basis for this message and i'm going to go ahead and do that now because as you're following along the book sometimes it's hard to put the book down and pick your bible up and the scriptures written in the message as well but i want to take some time and just look at it first revelation chapter one is going to be the first scripture that he goes to when he opens this message revelation chapter one we're going to read three places in our scriptures revelation chapter 1 and verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death now let's turn to romans chapter 8. during romans chapter 8 and we're going to read one scripture here and that's verse 11. romans chapter 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now let's go to mark 16. this will be the final one we read mark chapter 16. and in mark 16 we will start with verse one and read verse one and two mark 16 verse one and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and solomay had brought sweet spices that they may come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the sepulcher at the rising of the sun amen so that will be uh the scriptures that brother bannon will go to we want to go to your book or to your tablet whatever form you have it in and turn to page one we're going to begin right at the top of page one and also um brother franco has the audio playing but he also has the scrolling text that'll be scrolling so if you want to look up from your book and look at the screen you can also follow along there so at this time we can go ahead and start let us that head lord as we gather here this fine easter morning see the little bugs pressing we're way out the bees flying in and hitting their potion the birds singing like their hearts would burst the joy because there is an easter we believe that you raised up jesus from the dead many years ago today and we celebrate this memorial day and let there come an easter among us all today may we as disturbance understand his word that we are in his fellowship then and that now that we are risen with him and setting together in heavenly places bless the service here in the tabernacle and across the lands where it goes by this telephone heal all the sick and afflicted may it be an easter for them also and an exodus from sickness onto strength and those who are dead in sin and trespass may they live today through christ amen and we'll praise thee for we ask it in his name amen i certainly deemed this a marvelous privilege this morning to be back here in jeffersonville in indiana with this great congregation the church paxton standing in the round and outside in the lot ever worried to you people on the phones across the nation the beautiful morning here five o'clock this morning my little friend with a red breast flew up at the window and woke me up he might his little heart would burst and he is risen i've always thought that this little bird is being a friend to me because i like him as the legend about him says the little brown bird saw him suffering on the cross where sin had placed him of course the little bird had no sin he didn't have to die for the little bird but he flew into the cross and tried to pull the nails out with his little beast and he got his breath all red and that's the way i want mine too as this shield of trying to protect this glorious thing that he died for realizing that our time is limited here especially for those friends who are listening in by this telephone i would like to call your attention this morning to a a picture at some time ago was taken by uh the camera of a vision that i had here at the tabernacle of leaving indiana to arizona where i was to meet in a form of a pyramid seven angels not knowing what would happen later when i got there thinking it was the end of my life that no one could stand the blast and i'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story and then in slovenia canyon one morning like this while in prayer there had been a sword placed in my hand that this is the word and the story of the word later the angels appeared as was prophesied and at the same time a great cluster of light left where i was standing and moved 30 miles high in the air and around the circle like the wings of the angels and drawed into the skies the shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of angels that appeared the picture all the way from mexico as it moved from northern arizona where the holy spirit said it would be standing 40 miles northeast of tucson and it went into the air and life magazine packed the pictures a mystic something way in the spheres where there can be no moisture where there can be no evaporations of anything 30 miles high and 27 miles across and coming right up from where those angels were now they asked to know science the uh one of them in tucson wanted to know any significance but i didn't tell them you all do it told beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you and so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mystery seven-fold mystery of the bible has been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings uh hearing those mysteries marriage divorce serpentines all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself let's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days and now as this went up we have the picture outside on the plaque but then i have the picture laying present here if you have noticed as life magazine had it but i wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture see and the way it should be you remember i was preaching when this vision came upon the subject of the book of the revelations were the old judges where we seen jesus in revelations one when we started to open the seven seals of the or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of the seventh seal christ was standing with hair like wool white and i described that to you that the old english judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you probably see it in the audience it's christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as they could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and herders can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turned the picture from this way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be and can you see it he is supreme judge there's none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication of this message is the truth and making him not a third person but the only person with the white see the darkness faces beard his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to on the cross that's where he looked to the right where he pardoned the sinner and the blight of his resurrection we still go forth in his name i wish this morning that i had just much time to stand upon these phenomena that's beyond any shadow of doubt been proven for the past 30 years the 35 years right here at this church cut down on the river when that same light came down here in jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke those words as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second we're at the end times and we see it we wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the earth maybe sometimes we'll have a chance to explain that if god willing now i want you to turn in in your bible as we always believe that the word must come first of the reading of the word i always read that because if my words is the word of a man it will fail but the word of god can never fail now we're going to to read from the holy scriptures okay and we want you to turn first uh to um three places in the bible that i have chosen to read from one of them is in revelation the first chapter and the 17th and 18th verse this is where he appeared with his hair white as wool and his feet was like brass and then i want you also to get in your bibles romans 8 11. i've chosen this morning three places to read from the holy scriptures for my message today as the lord is placed upon my heart for the resurrection and then i want you to also mark 16 1 and 2. there i will draw my my context now in revelation 1 18 we read these words 17 and 18 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not for i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and hell and in romans the 8th chapter and 11th verse we read this but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and now in mark the 16th chapter the chapter of the resurrection the 16th chapter the first and second verses and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalena the mother and mary the mother of james and salami has brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun now my text this morning i want to take for a text it is the rising of the sun and for a subject i want to use the quickening power now you know you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speak in our noble brother neville this morning speaking his easter subject on the resurrection and i thought maybe i would take it a little different path not to be different but just to add a little more maybe in another angle or you the scriptures every angle you go with the scriptures it always declares jesus christ you cannot get away from it anyway it always declares him now as the world today in a a memorial service or at least in the united states in this side of the earth this morning and the churches and throughout uh celebrating a memorial of uh the greatest triumph that man ever had i think as a savior when he died or as an infant when he was born he could not have been your less being coming into the earth and when he died shortly he had sworn for our sins but yet there's been many fine little babies born and there's been many man who has suffered and died for a real cause but there never was one that could raise yourself up again until this day now that it is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all times this easter is where he proved what he had said man can say things but yet it isn't exactly can be believed upon thoroughly until it's been proved to be the truth and it's god who said prove all things the whole face to that which is good he would not tell you to do something that he would not do himself so he proved who this was that died for our sins and now not only is it a memorial day of all these great easter flowers and easter bonnets and pink rabbits and so forth that we've got into and holy celebrations which is all right but this is not the real thing that way as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once the year on on uh thursday and on friday we should take the communion and all different doctrines they argue about where they should be this day or that day or what should be a sabbath day or the first day of the week or all these things are just merely tradition what good would any of it do you whether you had lit or not lent if there's no life in you it's only a memorial which is nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their traditions but left off the main thing satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life your won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this resurrection morning only uh uh one day in the year or certain day that we celebrate this are are we benefactors of his resurrection amen what does it mean to me what does it mean to you now we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago now to find this text as i was tired my arm hurting me from shops that the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days um but have these shots done and on and with coloring yellow fever and everything i was pretty weary making me sick which seizure requires to have these shots before you go into the other nation and he said give caesar that which is caesar but then give god that which is god [Applause] and as i was sitting there wondering what would i speak to this waiting audience this morning which i'm very thankful for and men and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say but how should i do it what should i take for a text and then while i was sitting there almost asleep my door rattled uh out on the front side of the house nobody being there but myself as far as i knew i listened i didn't get it just right after a while the den room door where i have turned into my study it rattled and someone kept shaking the door huh i went to the door and opened the door and to my surprise a pretty little yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there looked like a little easter flower sitting here looking at me now she handed me a card and it was the uh of course i guess when i get home they'll be easter cards and so forth but the only one being leaving home that i'd received and she said brother branham this is from daddy and me she want to be sure that me was in it and her arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair had sent this card when i took it and thanked the little darling as she turned and walked away from the door i opened up the card and in the form of this card i drew my text for on the card was the saint mark 16 1-2 sun up the sun was rising and then i thought of that and then the subject of the quickening of jesus christ to be raised up from the dead drew my subject now the sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without thorn and it was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in this dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light amen and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the sun rose and swept across his rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the sunrise on that easter morning this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came greater news with this summer surprise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise brought a news that he is risen he is quickened from the dead as he's promised he's risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a a dual sun rising another sunrising it was that not only s u n rising it was the s o n had risen to bring eternal life to all god promises that before knowledge he'd seen laying upon the earth no more could the botany life live back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is up on the earth it takes a s-o-n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world on easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that they're called this son of god race it would also raise the life every son that was poor ordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at times when it first gone now this great breaking of the easter seal now today we have a tuberculosis easter seal people send a message one to the other and to support this great fun or drive for the doctors and medical science to work upon uh something to retire to help the tuberculosis they are still what we call an easter seal when we send message one to another but when we receive the message that seal is broken because the seal is what's got a message bound on the inside and now the true easter seal on this sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed amen before that time we didn't know the world uh grouped in darkness groped around man suspicion theory was among man's heart tradition made up man worship idols they worshipped the sun they worshipped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people that made claims they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal had been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning never one like it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and alive and he said when he come forth on that morning because i live you live also not only was he the beneficiary of the resurrection but all those seed that was resting in god's great prowess was a benefactor of that resurrection to life because he said because ali ye shall live also that was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up so will everyone that's in christ be brought up with him at this glorious sunrise god had proven or vindicated his word all the glooms and doubts that have moved in people's minds was taken away because here was he who once lived eat drink and fellowship with mankind that said i have power to lay my life down i have power to raise it up again and now not only had he made the statement but he proved it to be the truth amen what a glorious thing that is i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was amen because he raised from the dead we also have already raised from the head for we were in him notice now as the gloom covered the earth and the seeds could not live without the s-u in their eyes and plume had covered the earth and now the s-o-n was risen and all glue was banished by this light as it spread across of the nations to the people that he is not here but he has risen what uh what a statement he had proved his word he had proved it be to be true for he had now conquered death hell and the great the trinity of the devil death hell and the grave satan is the author of death he is the possessor of hell and also the great and that was the trinity of satan being caused by one thing that was death death you go up the grave and being a sinner you go to hell all the very one thing the trinity of satan which was death that had helped man in captivity all these years but now the true trinity of god being one manifested in christ who was life and it broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living god i am he that was dead and i'm alive forever lord has a jesus death and hell god in one made man and dwelt among us and conquered every enemy and it proved that the trinity of satan was conquered and if the trinity of god was made known because only god alone had power to bring life back again he was that emmanuel for god had been manifested in the flesh no wonder he could claim there matthew 27 chapter all powers in heaven earth is given into my hand i send you to be my witnesses to all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and caught out triumph with all the power and heavens and earth all that was the father all that was the holy ghost and all that there ever was was in him all powers in heaven and earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he had conquered it now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear enough for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore i have the keys to death in hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every for our daily predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth by the glorious gospel in every age it will bring forth the crop that god ordains it to do it he is raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is i am alive or quickened the word means the word quicken the greek word means that something that's made alive after death like the the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seat has to come forth again he was quickened not only that and will stand the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will stand it upon you to quicken you that where i am there ye will be also in luke 24 chapter 49 first he said behold i send the promise of the father upon you but terry are waking in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from ohio to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book of life and here they are on the earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth and also germanized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice now he come to share it with us no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news the good news what if a man died or faith that's good news if christ is born that's good news but never a news never was there news like this news that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise and he's alive forevermore and had the keys to both death and hell any time all the gloom was shut away there was no more gloom to be seen or the sun was up from the grave there was no oh he will come or he may come he had already come the gospel good news notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen go tell my disciples that i am risen from the dead and i'll meet with them to confirm this to them oh god how in this last days there shall be light again across here to my disciples go tell them that i am not dead and i'm not a tradition but i am a living christ amen i'll meet them take this message to my a disciple that i'm risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we as beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this fight the life he never was a life lived like it he was the son of god and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a living and how can we do it by word only or it is written the gospel can not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit to prove that he is alive now if there is another gospel that paul spoke to one of the groups i am so surprised that you turn to another gospel which there is a letter but a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news and because i live ye live also and i live in you and the works that i do john 14 12 the works that i do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection amendment in the evening time it shall be like that's the evening time now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we his beneficiaries we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is a liar we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it for some traditional man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life and if the life of a man's head be projected in you you will live the same life he lives if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of one man into another he'd absolutely be that typed blood and if your spirit that's in you is reconciled and you are anointed with the life that was in christ is upon you romans 8 11 says if the spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it'll also quicken your mortal body that same life then paying powers then say beneficiaries that he had your own earth from god he redeemed you a seed that was for known by god whose names was put on the land book of life before the foundation of the world and that gospel why do the resurrection the confirmation of the word how do we know he was a christ because he proves what he talks about god i know the message of the hour god proves what he's promised that he talks about that is the identification that we are of beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he's talked about what he promised to do in christ he proved it on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved him what he promised in the days of enoch he proved it in all the days of the apostles he proved it now i understand he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to god again oh what a message by easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in crying at his crucifixion they were ending at his resurrection we are with beneficiaries quicken after being dead in darkness in a darkened world of unbelief or churches and denominations and so forth had brought us out and there's something in us calling old we want god we're hungry and thirsty for god we join the methodist baptist pentecostal presbyterians what more still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all of a sudden while we was groping in darkness the great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of god like he was the manifestation of the promised word of god i will not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see christ he manifested in every word of god that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on the easter morning ah them who were once groping in darkness and wandering around if they should wash feet on this day or if they should keep a certain day or do a certain set of rules all those things passed away well that was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done every man-made reason there had never been to that time a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again when they say that jesus christ is deceit yesterday and forever that his power isn't the same that is gospel is the same when the bible says it's the same god's desire for denomination ever creed and he moved forth with his holy spirit as he promised hence proved it to us as he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection quicken after being fed in the world and sin and trespasses he is quickened us together with him raised with you now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus amen that does me a whole lot of good amen i enjoy the message and i enjoy the voice of the seventh angel god is so good friends i just want to take a minute and we'll bring out some points here and we'll answer these questions amen and today we we're not as long we'll be a little bit longer in the message the the next two times we do this but i want a little time to talk beforehand and set it up so the first question we had is what is brother branham's subject and if you turn to paragraph 23 which is uh on page four page four paragraph 23 he says now my text this morning i want to take for a text that is the rising of the sun and for a subject i want to use the quickening power so his text was the rising of the sun but he wanted to talk about the quickening power that was what has been given to us amen quickening power let's look here at the second question why does satan not care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine let's look at the next page page five and we'll begin it at paragraph 29 as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on thursday and on friday we should take the communion and all different doctrines they argue about whether it should be this day or that day or whether it should be sabbath day or the first day of the week all these things are just merely tradition what good would any of it do you whether you had lent or not lent if there is no life in you it's only a memorial which there is nothing against it but they've had certainly carried out their traditions but left off the main thing satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow that's the key amen when he resurrected it was the life of jesus christ that come back amen on the day of pentecost he sent that quickening power that life the power of the holy ghost back upon the people to quicken them to life amen and if you miss that none of it else is worth anything anyways whether you do lent or don't do lent whether you wash feet or take communion or keep all the ordinances of the church amen none of it matters if you don't get the quickening power to quicken you to life we've kept the religious orders we've kept the feast days and we've kept the holy days and we've kept church at tens and we've kept tithing amen but but if there's no quickening power to you to bring you to a new birth experience then it was all done in vain because the quickening power has come back amen the life of jesus christ upon his children let's read that again uh paragraph 30 i read that sentence again and move on satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again amen that when you're born again you've received the quickening power that quickens you to life man let's go to question number three how did brother banham get his text and his subject for this message i really like this one man if we go up to paragraph 32 at the bottom of this page he starts off here just above paragraph 32 that little sentence says now to find this text now he's telling you how he found this text as i was tired my arm hurting me from shots that the nurse gave me for to leave overseas now as you know in a few days and i must have these shots son and i and with cholera yellow fever and everything i was pretty weary making me sick which caesar requires to have these shots before you go into the other nation and he said give caesar that which is caesar's but then give god that which is god's and i was sitting there wondering what would i speak to this waiting audience this morning i absolutely love this this to me when brother bannon preaches it is the rising of the sun this is a one of the most profound messages that he preaches full of meat with impact on our life now and he's sitting here the morning he's preaching it wondering what will i preach what will i preach amen and sometimes we think in ourselves that brother brenham had everything mapped out and he had it all figured out and he knew no he was just a man like you and i are a man but he had a gift in him and god was leading him step by step by step the same way he's leading you and i we don't have the next day figured out we don't have the next sermon figured out all we're doing is trusting in god to lead us step by step day by day just the way he led the prophet and here he is the morning he's preaching i'm telling you if this was me i would be in tears but brother branham had got to the place where he knew god would give him direction and god was leading i was as i was sitting there wondering what would i speak to this waiting audience this morning which i'm very thankful for and men and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say how should i do it what should i take for a text and then when i was sitting there almost asleep my door rattled out on the front side of the house nobody being there but myself as far as i knew i listened i didn't get it just right after a while the din room door where i turned into my study it rattled and someone kept shaking the door and i went to the door and opened the door and to my surprise a pretty little yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there looked like a little easter flower that's sitting here looking at me now she handed me a card and it was of course i guess when i get home they'll be easter cards and so forth but the only one being leaving home that i had received and she said brother brother branham this is from daddy and me she wanted to be sure that me was in it and her arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair had sent this card when i looked it when i took it and thanked the little darling and she turned and walked away from the door i opened up the card and in the form of this card i drew my text for on the card was the saint mark 16 1-2 sun up the sun was rising then i thought of that and then the subject of the quickening of jesus christ to be raised up from the dead i drew my subject see we don't know what impact we have just living life brother ben said that this little girl who delivered this car she did it on behalf of her and her daddy and her daddy was an arthritic father he was he was he was suffering with arthritis and in a wheelchair but he got in his heart that he would send this card to brother branham and the whole thing was orchestrated by god you know you know who knows if this man ever really understand the part he played or maybe the little girl didn't fully understand the part she played but they played a significant part in the message of the hour don't ever underrate yourself and don't ever when god leads you to do something if it's as simple as sending somebody a card or a text message or a phone call don't underrate that if you feel inspired to do it do it you have no idea what god will take he took a little boy's lunch one time and fed five thousand what will he do if he inspires you with a little note of encouragement little word a little something that he calls you to do you have no idea how far that will reach and what impact that will have so i absolutely found that amazing where brother branham got the text and the subject for this message was from that arthritic father who wanted to send a card to the prophet and send his little blue-eyed blond-haired darling over there to deliver it praise be to god god god works through his body question number four what was the s-o-n rise 4 what was the sunrise 4 let's go to paragraph 40 here at the bottom of page 6. the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sun rising another sun rising it was not only the s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth mother of them takes us and types it all the way back to genesis 1 amen when genesis in genesis 1 2 we find the earth and cursed state amen darkness shrouded it and water covered the face of the deep but god had put seeds down in there and they were dermatized seed that had to come to life and when god first spoke and created an atmosphere and a condition amen and brought light upon the earth he was doing it to bring the seed up and this time at the rising of the sun when the s-o-n came up out of the grave amen it was to do the same thing it was to bring the light of life upon the seed that was laying there to bring you and i to life for the seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth no more could the bodily life live back there at the beginning without the s-u-n to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is upon the earth it takes the s o n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world and on easter morning then in this in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time your body was predestinated and four ordained and already laying or the material for your body was already here at that time at the resurrection and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that because this son of god raised it would also raise the life every sun that was foreordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at time when it first dawned let's go over to paragraph 54 on page 9 and continue reading paragraph 54 on page 9. now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys to death and hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordained it to he had raised from the dead it was a guarantee he said fear not don't have any more fear if you're a predestinated seed of god foreordained chosen in christ before the foundation of the world and have your name written in the lamb's book of life as that s-o-n is traveling through the last seven church ages in every season and every age it'll bring that seed to life that's what he's done for you that's what he's done for me that's what he'll do for every predestinated seed because it is the rising of the sun it is the resurrected of jesus christ and his light is shining upon the earth to bring those seeds to life today praise god oh what a wonderful thing that is i'm alive or quickened the word means quicken the greek word means that something that's made alive after death like the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rot every bit of the seed in every bit of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again he was quick and not only that and will send that same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that where i am there you will be also so the same power listen what was your born-again experience the very same power that brought him out of the grave was the very same power that came upon you to bring you out of the grave of the deadness of laodicea and bring you into life not a different force not a different power but the same power the resurrection power of jesus christ by the resurrection light from the s-o-n amen the same power that raised him up was the same power that quickened you to life that's power friends and is the same power that will still quicken the seed tonight paragraph 58 in luke 24 chapter 49 verse he said behold i send the promise of the father upon you but tarry year await you in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high to show that only he did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he came to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book of life and here they are on earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth and also germatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice now he came to share it with us he came to share the resurrection with you and i that's why brother branham started off he said is this resurrection just a memorial was he raised up for a memorial what was it for does it have anything to do with me amen what does it have to do with me it happened two thousand years ago and brother ben i'm starting to tell us it has everything to do with you because he said because i live you live amen if it wasn't for him raising you couldn't raise but because i live you live also amen praise god chapter our question five what are we quickened from let's turn the page here to page 11. what are we quickened from paragraph 73 on page 11. on easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him you mean i raised back then absolutely you've already raised that's why you were guaranteed to raise in this generation because you already raised they were in christ at his crucifixion they were in him at his resurrection we are his beneficiaries beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness the darkened world of unbelief where churches and denominations and so forth had drawn us out and there's something in us calling oh we want god we're hungry and thirsting for god we joined the methodist baptists pentecostals presbyterians and what more and still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all of a sudden while we were groping in darkness a great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of god and it brought us out of dark denominationalism let's go over to paragraph 79 on page 12 next page paragraph 79 we are the benefactors of his resurrection quickened after being dead in the world in sin and trespasses he has quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus we were dead in the world just like those seeds in genesis 1 2 covered in darkness underneath the deep the face of the deep darkness covered the face of the deep but god parted the waters and let the light of the life of jesus christ hit us by the revealed word of the hour and bring that seed to life amen we were pulled out of the darkness of the world praise god those were the questions that i had but there's a couple points i'd like to bring out if we can go all the way back to page one there's a statement brother brennan makes here that i find it fascinating and it comes right out of the scriptures but i want to just watch it here in a couple places and let's look at paragraph two and let there come an easter among us all today may we as his servants understand his word that we were in his fellowship then did you catch that you were in his fellowship then and that now that we are risen with him and sitting together in heavenly places let's flip the page on page two and go to paragraph 12. so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mystery sevenfold mystery of the bible has been closed up since the foundation the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings hearing these mysteries marriage divorce servancy and all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself himself that's opened these seven mysteries of what the church was and how it was in christ at the beginning it's the same thing it was in christ at the beginning and how will be revealed in the last days let's go to paragraph 73 all the way over on page eleven seventy-three paragraph 73 on page 11 on easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in christ at his crucifixion they were in him at his resurrection we are his beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness now let's go to paragraph 49 back on page 8. paragraph 49 on page 8 i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from the dead we also have already raised from the dead for we were in him how many of you believe that you were in him amen the price has been paid when was the price paid for me when i was in him and paid the price for my sins and i resurrected with him and now everything that happened there is being manifest in this tabernacle of flesh today but why is it being manifested because it happened in him amen back then let's go to paragraph 70. i just want to highlight a point here on page 11 paragraph 70. page are your paragraph 70 page 11. in that gospel light of the resurrection the confirmation of the word how did we know he was the christ because he proved what he was talking about how will i know the message of the hour god proves what he promised and he's talking about did god prove it he proved it that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about what he promised to do in christ he proved it on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved it what he promised in the days of enoch he proved it and all the days of the apostles he proved it now in this day he proves what he said because they are part of the seed that was predestinated in the book of life that he come to redeem back to god again oh what a message but brother brahm's saying in every day god proved the word he proved it in moses he proved it in enoch he proved it in christ he proved it by bringing it to pass and today we know that the manifestation of the word amen is the it is the coming of jesus christ and the formation of the bride and that bride will have his very same life but he will prove it amen moses didn't have anything to prove enoch didn't have anything to prove none of them have anything to prove all they were doing was being obedient to what god told them to do and god proved that what they said was true god vindicated his word god backed it up he didn't ask moses to do it he did it himself he just asked moses to believe him and say what he says and in this day the bride has nothing to prove amen all she needs to do is what moses did and what enoch did and what elijah did amen she just must be obedient to him and say what he said say it the way he said say it do what he says do and he will prove his word once again like he always has he'll prove it in your life he'll prove it in my life amen he'll prove his word we just have to stay with his word because it's god who proves it moses had no power to prove it he not had no power to prove it god was the one who proved it when they stayed with the word let's go back to paragraph 61 on page 10. i want to finish with this notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he has risen go tell my disciples that i am risen from the dead and i'll meet them with them to confirm this to them oh god how in this last day there shall be light again across the earth and i'll prove to my disciples go tell them that i'm not dead i'm not a tradition but i'm a living christ i'll meet them take this message to my disciples that i am risen from the dead the gospel good news i'd like to say today there's still a light shining in the land and that light is to prove that he's not dead he's not a dead christ he's a living christ he's not a dead tradition in a dead church with a dead denomination but he's a living christ and where is he alive he's alive in me amen he's alive in you he's alive in his predestinated seed who's been quickened amen by the rising of the sun in this day because brother branham said it is the rising of the sun and this rising of the sun rose to bring me to life did it rise to bring you to life amen and what's he here to do the message is to prove that he's risen it's not a dead tradition it's not a creed it's not something in the past is a present tense living christ the power of resurrection to resurrect his children to life and then he is here to manifest himself and you and i amen god be praised musicians if you'd come brother ben if you'll come man let's all stand oh i'm so thankful for the message of the hour every time i listen to it it just refreshes me amen it just stirs something deep inside of me i mean something there's something in me amen the seed of god that's in me that was that was preordained to respond to that message amen something in me is down in a receiver a crystal that has dialed in to pick up that wavelength and somebody may listen to it and say well that's really loud and he's yelling and what's he talking about he's condemning churches but there's something dialed in you and me that says oh that's the truth that's the truth too and that's the truth also amen that's nothing but the truth thank god for it i didn't put it there amen i didn't have the capacity to change myself and remember before the foundation of the world amen that frequency was already dialed into that seed and god knew what day and what age it would come forth and what vessel would be tabernacled in and god already knew and ordained it for this day and all i'm doing is responding to god's plan and god's purpose i didn't have the power to make anything happen i didn't have the power to quicken myself i didn't have the power to bring about a new birth i couldn't do it by my actions i couldn't do it by my conduct i couldn't do it by my begging but god had the power the quickening power that he had sent in this day and that quickening power quicken the seed to life and all i can do is respond to him and say praise you lord jesus be it unto me according to your worry i love this message i know you do too and i enjoy listening to it together amen this is something that i really enjoy let's sing let's just worship today we're hopeless and so weary slaves are waiting for the day of liberty just to see the glorious sunrise from the highest mountaintop and this dawn will see their shackles falling off it's the
