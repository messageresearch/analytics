[0:00] he finds out that the one that he had
[0:02] been persecuting he thought they were
[0:04] people that had a false religion and a
[0:06] false idea and were ruining the the
[0:10] Bible yeah when he come to find out in
[0:12] that encounter that he was persecuting
[0:14] Jesus Christ himself who is living in
[0:16] those people amen and now his whole
[0:20] world changes amen does he come to
[0:22] repentance he absolutely comes to
[0:24] repentance cuz his whole thinking
[0:28] changed when he gets up from that
[0:30] experience he can't even see to walk he
[0:33] has to be led by the hand into the City
[0:38] and he's led by the hand into the city
[0:40] the Bible says he lays there for three
[0:43] days with no sight and no
[0:49] food I wonder what he thought about for
[0:52] three
[0:54] days I wonder how many things he
[0:58] regretted for 3
[1:01] days I
[1:02] wonder with this Revelation that just
[1:05] hit him as a literal light out of
[1:08] Heaven changed his whole world his whole
[1:11] Paradigm all his
[1:13] understanding and you know when it all
[1:16] changed it left him humble and
[1:19] broken it wasn't
[1:22] flippant it wasn't oh yeah I see that
[1:25] I'll take no it wrecked his
[1:28] universe
[1:30] amen yeah yeah this is why brother B
[1:34] says in one place I doubt a dry-eyed
[1:38] confession it's not that you have to cry
[1:41] to be converted that's that's not what
[1:43] he's
[1:44] saying but back in his day there was so
[1:46] many decisions for Christ and raising
[1:48] your hand if you agree and you want to
[1:50] be saved and and and fill out a card or
[1:52] come forward and repeat after me prayer
[1:55] amen but there was there was none of
[1:56] this Brokenness none of this weeping
[1:59] bitterly none of this realizing I'm not
[2:01] what I thought I was I thought I was a
[2:02] Christian but I'm not really a Christian
[2:04] I thought I was a message believer but I
[2:06] see now I'm not really got the change
[2:09] that I was projecting to other people
[2:11] because inside I have no power to
[2:15] overcome that's not something to take
[2:17] lightly that's not something to move on
[2:19] Beyond we don't keep pretending we don't
[2:21] keep moving on in our own Pride amen we
[2:23] need to come to a weeping bitterly we
[2:25] need to come to a place when we're flat
[2:27] on our back broken and humiliated with a
[2:30] couple days to think about
[2:32] it and I'm sure he was thinking about
[2:35] how could I been so wrong how could I
[2:37] missed it and I'm sure he was thinking
[2:38] about Steven
[2:47] stoning amen amen sometimes what we need
[2:52] is to realize we're not what we thought
[2:54] we were Lord and we need a bit of
[2:57] humility and Brokenness
[3:00] and some weeping some Contrition some
[3:03] quiet time to sit and say God you've got
[3:07] to help me because I can't help
[3:12] myself what we don't need to do is just
[3:14] keep moving on and hope everything works
[3:17] out
