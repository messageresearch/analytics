[0:00] I there's a lot of things I'm not good
[0:02] at, but there's something that I'm built
[0:03] for.
[0:04] And that's what we got to yield
[0:06] ourselves to and be comfortable with the
[0:08] things that we're not good at. And be
[0:10] okay saying, "I can't do that."
[0:13] Everybody else is better at that than
[0:14] me. I can't do it. What's wrong with
[0:18] that? Everybody has something that God's
[0:21] given you to make you a success in what
[0:23] he wants you to do. Yeah. And there's
[0:25] something you can do as good or better
[0:27] than anybody else, but you can't do it
[0:29] all and you never will. But if you're
[0:32] not doing that part, you're hindering
[0:34] all of us. So when we fixate on what we
[0:38] can't be, we stop becoming what we are.
[0:42] We fixate and we worry and we struggle
[0:44] and we compare and we grumble and we we
[0:47] dislike ourselves and we get
[0:49] discouraged. But listen, that's all
[0:51] that's just trapping of the devil.
[0:53] That's just to keep us from the real
[0:55] purpose. What we need to do is relax.
[0:57] Amen. Because what God placed in you to
[1:00] do, he placed in you to do. It comes
[1:02] natural.
[1:04] It just comes. You ever seen somebody
[1:06] Listen, I I I tell
[1:08] you, David Lamb over there, he kind of
[1:11] makes me a little bit
[1:13] sick. I can't play nothing. He can pick
[1:16] up an instrument he's never touched
[1:18] before. In 30 minutes, he can be
[1:19] squeaking out and playing a song. Amen.
[1:22] Somebody had a violin the other day.
[1:23] Never played a violin before. He doesn't
[1:25] know how to hold it. He's holding it
[1:26] wrong right here. And he's playing a
[1:28] song.
[1:33] But you know what? He didn't work for
[1:34] it.
[1:36] He didn't work. He didn't pay. He didn't
[1:39] labor. It just came.
[1:43] It just came. Amen. He can't help it.
[1:46] And it doesn't mean the things God given
[1:48] us do, we don't work at them. Sometimes
[1:49] we do work at them. Sometimes we put
[1:51] forth effort, but the effort we put
[1:52] forth is somewhat enjoyable because
[1:54] we're designed to do it. It doesn't mean
[1:56] that there's no work, no effort, no
[1:58] learning, no growing, no getting better,
[2:00] but all of those things we're enjoying
[2:02] because that's the way we're made,
[2:03] right? Amen.
[2:07] So, I can't do that. Give me 30 minutes
[2:10] and a violin and you don't want to be in
[2:12] the room 30 minutes later.
[2:17] But, oh, if God could help us just
[2:18] relax. and just to be what we are.
[2:23] Stop trying to conform or stop trying to
[2:26] be what we imagine we're supposed to be
[2:29] because what we're supposed to be is
[2:31] what he ordained us to be and what he
[2:32] ordained us to be. He's designed us to
[2:34] fit that mold. And we'll never fit into
[2:37] another one. We'll never fit in our
[2:38] brother's mold. We'll never fit in our
[2:39] sister's mold. We're only ever going to
[2:41] fit in ours.
[2:43] So, if we could just relax. Amen. I
[2:47] believe this message came to put us in
[2:49] position. Amen. I believe this message
[2:52] came for all of us to get in position.
[2:53] And I believe this message came to take
[2:55] away every barrier that's a barrier to
[2:57] us fulfilling our purpose. That's right.
[2:59] And if that barrier is in our mind, then
[3:02] this word will take that barrier out of
[3:03] our mind. If it's if it's somewhere else
[3:05] around us, a restriction. I believe this
[3:07] message came to take away the barriers
[3:09] of denomination, the barriers of
[3:10] misunderstanding, the barriers of false
[3:12] doctrine, and even the barriers of our
[3:14] own wrong understanding about ourselves.
[3:16] Amen.
[3:18] To strip those barriers away so we could
[3:21] just be comfortable in our own skin.
