[0:00] He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a
[0:08] debt I could not pay. I needed
[0:14] someone to wash my sins
[0:21] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[0:28] Amazing
[0:30] grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a
[0:36] debt that I could never
[0:43] pay. He paid a debt at
[0:49] Calary. He cleans my soul and he set me
[0:54] free. I'm glad that
[0:58] Jesus did all my sins
[1:05] erased. And I now can sing a brand new
[1:11] song. Amazing grace.
[1:15] All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt
[1:22] that I could never
[1:27] pay. And now he's coming back for
[1:33] me. I'll live with him
[1:38] eternally. Oh, it's been
[1:42] glorious to see him in this
[1:49] day. I now will sing a brand new
[1:55] song. Amazing grace.
[2:00] All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt
[2:06] that I could never
[2:10] pay. Verse one again. He paid a debt. He
[2:16] did not owe. I owed a debt. I could not
[2:23] pay. I
[2:25] needed
[2:27] someone to wash my sins
[2:34] away. And now I sing a brand new
[2:40] song. Amazing
[2:43] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[2:50] debt when I could never pay
[2:55] [Music]
[3:01] in this beautiful
[3:05] valley that he's put me
[3:11] in. I'm learning to
[3:16] trust and draw strength from him.
[3:23] I'll not
[3:27] despise the lessons he
[3:32] gives. For in this beautiful
[3:38] valley, I'm learning to live.
[3:44] The shadows
[3:49] around can't hide the
[3:54] sun or hold back the
[3:59] dawning of a new day to come.
[4:06] Walking
[4:08] beside
[4:10] me is Jesus, God's
[4:15] son. And he'll ever be with
[4:20] me till the testing is
[4:25] done in this beautiful
[4:29] [Music]
[4:31] valley that he's put me in.
[4:38] I'm learning to
[4:42] trust and draw strength from
[4:48] him. I'll not
[4:52] despise the lessons he gives.
[4:58] For in this beautiful
[5:03] valley I'm learning to
[5:08] live. When there's a lesson for
[5:14] learning, he'll take you
[5:19] aside to walk in the
[5:22] [Music]
[5:25] valley, close by your side.
[5:29] [Music]
[5:31] upon the
[5:33] [Music]
[5:35] mountain. Sweet
[5:37] blessings he
[5:40] gives. But down in the
[5:45] valley is where we learn to
[5:50] live. in this beautiful
[5:56] valley that he's put me
[6:01] in. I'm learning to
[6:06] trust and draw strength from
[6:12] him. I'll not
[6:17] despise the lessons he gives.
[6:22] For in this beautiful
[6:27] valley I'm learning to
[6:31] [Music]
[6:33] live. I'll not
[6:38] despise the lessons he gives.
[6:43] For in this beautiful
[6:46] [Music]
[6:48] valley I'm
[6:51] learning
[6:55] to
[7:01] [Music]
[7:07] live. I look
[7:10] back in history, I see a mighty
[7:16] God
[7:19] unveiled,
[7:21] proving over and
[7:24] over, that his word will never fail.
[7:31] But I'm not just
[7:35] dwelling on a past
[7:41] [Music]
[7:43] memory. For the same
[7:47] God is
[7:49] living in me.
[7:55] Oh, he's the same
[7:58] God who spoke
[8:01] to the woman
[8:04] at the
[8:06] well. He's the same
[8:09] God whose
[8:12] wonders are too
[8:15] many to tell.
[8:19] The same
[8:21] God who
[8:24] bened the
[8:26] raing red
[8:31] sea. And he's the same
[8:35] God who's
[8:37] living in me.
[8:41] [Music]
[8:44] For the same
[8:46] God who
[8:49] created all the
[8:51] heavens and all the
[8:56] earth came back living in
[9:00] Jesus. There was
[9:03] power in his word.
[9:07] But now
[9:09] in these last
[9:12] days, I'm
[9:14] beginning to
[9:20] see that he's the same
[9:23] God who's
[9:26] living in me.
[9:32] He's the same
[9:35] God who spoke
[9:38] to the woman
[9:40] at the
[9:43] well. He's the same
[9:46] God whose
[9:48] wonders are too
[9:51] many to tell.
[9:55] The same
[9:57] God who
[10:00] pardoned the
[10:02] raging
[10:08] res and he's the same
[10:11] God who's
[10:14] living in me.
[10:20] Open our
[10:23] eyes, Lord.
[10:29] We want to see
[10:35] [Music]
[10:40] Jesus to reach
[10:43] out and
[10:46] touch
[10:51] him and say that we
[10:58] love
[11:01] him.
[11:03] Open our
[11:07] ears,
[11:12] Lord, and help us to live.
[11:20] [Music]
[11:26] Open our
[11:30] eyes,
[11:32] [Music]
[11:35] Lord. We want to see
[11:42] Jes once
[11:44] more.
[11:47] Open our
[11:50] eyes, Lord.
[11:55] [Music]
[11:57] We want to see
[12:07] Jesus to reach
[12:10] out and
[12:14] touch
[12:15] [Music]
[12:19] him. Yes. Say that we
[12:25] love
[12:29] him. Open our
[12:34] ears
[12:40] for help us to live.

[13:24] with the saints. And we thank you for
[13:26] watching over us and them in our time of
[13:29] separation. And now we're together again
[13:30] to worship you, Lord, to sing your
[13:33] praises, to hear your word, to commune
[13:36] with you, Lord. We pray, Lord, that you
[13:38] come and take this vessel under your
[13:40] control and speak, Lord, words of life.
[13:43] Give us guidance, instruction,
[13:45] encouragement. Lord, talk to us, Lord,
[13:47] and give us ears to hear, heart to
[13:50] perceive, and a desire for all that you
[13:52] have for us. We love you, and we thank

[14:59] the brothers who preached while we're
[15:00] away. Brother Gabe, he preached for us
[15:02] on the Wednesday. And then uh brother
[15:04] Chris Tate preached and I got to listen
[15:06] to both services back to back on the
[15:08] plane rides coming home and I was
[15:10] blessed by them both and enjoyed them
[15:11] very much. And I called brother Gabe and
[15:14] told him I said I listened to your
[15:15] message. It was wonderful brother. I was
[15:18] touched cuz that was the title of a
[15:20] sermon touched. Amen. Right there in the
[15:23] airplane I got touched. Amen. And I

[15:49] to you from everybody. Like so many
[15:53] people wanted to send greetings back,

[16:00] Everybody said to tell you hello.
[16:02] Everybody loves you guys and they they
[16:04] still remember you and love you. They
[16:06] haven't forgotten. And then the Bradner
[16:08] family, their family, and the Lao
[16:10] family, they all send back greetings and
[16:12] and uh so many. We saw Sister Arlene
[16:15] Loker's sister there and her
[16:16] brother-in-law. Amen. And it was good to
[16:19] see them. And Amanda Seabolt's got
[16:20] family out there, the Yes. and then they
[16:22] said hello and they wanted me to send
[16:23] greetings back to you all. So there's
[16:25] everybody and there's so many people
[16:27] come up to me and said wanted to send
[16:28] greetings back because they remember
[16:30] coming to the family camps for years and
[16:32] years and years and they all they have
[16:34] so many names they ask are they there?
[16:36] How's this family doing? And and so it
[16:39] was really it was really fun to see them
[16:41] all down there. And then a special
[16:43] greeting the most special of all from
[16:45] brother Matthew Erent. Amen. We got to
[16:48] see him and he's doing very well. Sister
[16:50] Janet, you'd be proud of him. He's doing
[16:52] really well. And one day, we're in the
[16:54] uh back in brother uh uh Ron's um study
[16:59] in the pastor study. And here comes
[17:01] Matthew walking in asking for notes that
[17:03] he can put on the projector and he's
[17:05] part of the audiovisisual tech team
[17:07] working out there. So, he's he's entered
[17:09] right in and doing a work and he's doing
[17:11] really really well. So, it was good to
[17:12] see him. So, he sends greetings. And
[17:14] then we also got to see uh brother Sal,
[17:17] sister Marge Marzulli while we were down
[17:18] there. So that was good. And also,
[17:21] Brother David and Diane and Sister Ruth
[17:23] Deanhart were all down there. They were
[17:25] all down there already, and they just
[17:26] come to the meetings. So, it was like a
[17:28] little reunion we had in Arizona. It was
[17:29] great. We just missed the rest of you
[17:31] all. You should have come down. Amen.
[17:34] Also, Brother Jonathan Barb Gardener and
[17:36] his daughter Emma were down. They went
[17:38] down and and then after the meetings,
[17:40] they got to go see the Grand Canyon. I
[17:41] didn't get to see that part, but that
[17:43] was a blessing. And brother David Evans
[17:45] was down. I was shocked to see him
[17:46] there. he came down and was there in the
[17:48] meeting. So, it was really a wonderful
[17:51] time and it was a lot of fun. And I want
[17:54] to bring back special greetings from
[17:56] brother Jason Watkins. He he ministered
[17:58] there as well and he wanted me to greet
[17:59] all of you and he's got quite a history
[18:01] here with the church from the years that
[18:03] he did missions work with brother Lonnie
[18:05] especially the Russian work uh for the
[18:08] Russian speaking bride. Then brother Ron
[18:09] Peterson wanted to send greetings. Then
[18:11] I also had a chance when I was coming
[18:13] back into Phoenix to see brother Aaron
[18:15] McGary and spend some time with him and
[18:17] he sent greetings as well. So it was it
[18:21] was really good. It was a wonderful
[18:23] time. Amen. I went down a few days early
[18:27] and um because I wanted to go down to
[18:31] Tucson to go to Sabino Canyon. So I took
[18:34] some pictures. I wanted to show some
[18:35] pictures to you because I wanted to go
[18:36] up uh in the place where some of the
[18:38] supernatural things that happened to
[18:40] brother Brandham. And while I was there,
[18:42] it just worked out that I could get away
[18:44] a couple days early and and I really
[18:46] wanted to go and clear my mind before
[18:48] the meetings and things had been busy
[18:49] leading up to it. And it was just what
[18:51] the doctor ordered. It was just perfect.
[18:53] And so I got to spend an entire day in
[18:55] Sabino Canyon by myself and I end up
[18:58] hiking about 7 miles through the canyon
[19:00] and it was absolutely lovely. So this
[19:03] picture here, I mean, I'm sorry to show
[19:05] this to you because the blue hurts your
[19:07] eyes. I mean, it's so sunny and so blue
[19:09] and so painful to look at. I told my
[19:13] wife, I said, "The sky is so blue it
[19:15] hurts, you know." And I was like,
[19:16] "What's the weather there?" "It's
[19:18] raining." Oh,
[19:20] sorry. But here's some cactus right at
[19:22] the visitor center at the beginning to
[19:24] uh Sabino Canyon. And we know that the
[19:26] Lord had called Brother Brandham to
[19:28] Sabino Canyon. It was a special place.
[19:30] And he had a significant events happen a
[19:33] couple different times while he was up
[19:34] there. And so I wanted to go see it. I
[19:38] started off by going all the way down to
[19:40] the uh creek that was down there. And
[19:42] it's amazing to see water flowing in the
[19:44] desert in the bottom of this canyon. And
[19:47] it reminded me of that scripture like
[19:49] streams in the desert. And it was just
[19:51] beautiful down there. And the whole
[19:53] place was stunning. This is a picture
[19:55] from up on the trail looking down at the
[19:57] canyon. And if you look down at that V
[19:59] at the far end, that's the valley.
[20:01] You're looking at Tucson, the city of
[20:02] Tucson right there. And if you listen to
[20:04] the tapes, Brother Ram talks about that.
[20:05] I was up there and I could look down
[20:07] over the valley and see Tucson. And it
[20:09] was really quite amazing. And I wanted
[20:11] to go see the place where uh the rock
[20:14] was that had the white eagle, the white
[20:16] quartz written on it that Brother Vim
[20:18] talks about. And uh and going up to it,
[20:22] uh there's some significant markers. I'd
[20:24] never seen it before, but I read a
[20:26] document brother Perry Green had put
[20:27] together about how he found it. And I
[20:29] was just hoping that I would be able to
[20:30] find it. So, I was up by myself in there
[20:32] and looking around and it took me about
[20:34] an hour. I found some of the markers,
[20:36] but I couldn't find it. And just before
[20:38] I was ready to quit, that's the way it
[20:41] always goes. After an hour almost of
[20:43] searching, I found it. Amen. And and uh
[20:46] but one of the significant markers is
[20:48] there's a a formation called the Eagle
[20:51] Formation. And it's up here perched up
[20:53] on this rock. It looks like an eagle.
[20:55] Amen. Looking sideways. And the back of
[20:57] the eagle's there. And when you're
[20:59] there, you can really really see it
[21:00] looking down and where it's looking to,
[21:03] it's looking right towards this rock.
[21:05] And so when I saw that, I knew I was
[21:07] close. And I was like, "That's it. I'm
[21:09] here." But here was not here. I was
[21:12] looking all over. I thought I found the
[21:14] rock. And then I compared it to a
[21:15] picture I downloaded. I said, "That's
[21:17] not the rock." And I sat on a rock and I
[21:19] looked around and I walked back and
[21:20] forth and I was all over the place. And
[21:23] then uh and then I I'd gone a little
[21:26] further. I went a little further back in
[21:28] the canyon and I started comparing and I
[21:30] dropped down off the the the trail and I
[21:33] turned around and there was the rock
[21:36] right there's the rock where in white
[21:39] quartz there was eagle written and many
[21:40] of you know but I don't know that all of
[21:42] the young people would know this but
[21:45] this was a humongous rock that rock
[21:47] you're picking it's like a
[21:48] pyramid-shaped rock there goes into the
[21:50] form of a pyramid the top of that it's
[21:52] about 7 feet high when you stand right
[21:54] up against it uh it's over my head by a
[21:57] long shot. It's a huge rock, but this
[22:00] rock was split in half cuz the trail
[22:02] used it's up above this rock now. It
[22:04] used to go down in front of that. And to
[22:06] make the trail, they drilled holes and
[22:08] blasted it and split it. And you can
[22:09] look down over the hill and see the
[22:10] other half, which is as big as this
[22:12] humongous, humongous rock. So that means
[22:15] when this rock was formed, however it
[22:17] was formed, however many thousands,
[22:20] millions, who knows how many years ago,
[22:22] God had put a vein of quartz in the
[22:24] center of this rock and it would spell
[22:26] out the word eagle in English. Yeah.
[22:30] Before there was English,
[22:32] there was a white quartz vein that said
[22:35] eagle and and it was bound up in the
[22:37] middle of the rock cuz the revelation's
[22:39] in the rock. Amen. And for some reason,
[22:43] Amen. the the Department of Natural
[22:45] Resources just figured we better bring
[22:47] the trail here, but oh this gigantic
[22:49] rock, why don't we blast it by dynamite
[22:52] right in the middle? And when they blew
[22:54] it in half, right in the middle of the
[22:56] rock was the white rock. Amen. That said
[22:59] eagle. And so you can see it doesn't say
[23:03] eagle anymore because shortly after it
[23:04] was found, people started chipping off
[23:06] the courts. And if you look at it, you
[23:08] can see pock marks all over it. Even all
[23:10] over the rock face is pockm mark for
[23:12] people have been hammering and beating
[23:13] on it and taking away souvenirs. So I
[23:16] guess the Catholic spirit still lives on
[23:19] wanting relics and tokens and things. So
[23:21] it's a shame that it's broke up like
[23:23] that. But it was just a pleasure to
[23:25] stand there and that's where brother Ben
[23:27] was leaning against this rock with his
[23:28] hands in the air praying and God says
[23:31] what's what's that under your heart?
[23:32] What's under under your chest? And he
[23:34] looked down and that's when he saw eagle
[23:36] there. And so it's just beautiful the
[23:38] way the Lord led him. But if you look at
[23:40] the eagle, if you look up at the
[23:42] precipice there, you can see the eagle
[23:44] formation looking down at the eagle
[23:46] rock. And so it's amazing. You should
[23:49] all go see it.
[23:51] And if you need a tour guide, I'll go
[23:53] with you.
[23:56] Amen. So then we come out of the trail
[23:58] and we went the other direction. And if
[23:59] you look back into the canyon, you can
[24:01] see this mound of rock. That's a huge
[24:03] mound. It doesn't look so big from the
[24:04] picture, but on the top of that mound is
[24:07] Pullpit Rock. And this is where Brother
[24:09] Brennan was standing when the Lord
[24:10] placed a sword in his hand. And so
[24:13] there's a picture of it from across a
[24:15] part of the canyon. We hiked over to it.
[24:17] This is Pullpit Rock when you get up to
[24:20] it. And uh when you stand up on it, I
[24:23] had a book. I had my little backpack, a
[24:25] little daypack that I had with some
[24:26] water and things that I had for the
[24:28] hike. And I had slipped in there a
[24:30] little book that I was reading on the
[24:31] plane ride. And it's this book here,
[24:33] Stature of a Perfect Man. And that's on
[24:35] top the pull pit. So if you're standing
[24:37] at the pull pit, you're preaching
[24:38] through the cactus. And uh it's but it's
[24:41] a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful scene.
[24:44] Amen. I got a little video. I took a
[24:46] panoramic from being up. It's like there
[24:48] you're down in the canyon and it's like
[24:50] you're halfway up the canyon wall and
[24:51] there's this precipice that comes out,
[24:52] just juts up and you just stand up there
[24:54] and and that's where this is at. And uh
[24:57] I'll show you this little video that I
[25:00] did a little panoramic. That's Tucson
[25:03] down there straight down the
[25:06] canyon. And then you can see the canyon
[25:09] walls. And you can look down. I'll pan
[25:12] down here in a second. You'll see that
[25:13] little creek way down in there. And it's
[25:15] quite far away. And the canyon goes way
[25:17] way back in there. And it's so rugged.
[25:20] And there's pull pit rock. It's so
[25:22] rugged and so rough. You can see why the
[25:24] prophet loved it. I mean, such a rough
[25:27] place. There's the canyon walls going
[25:29] up. And there's that little divot right
[25:31] there where Brother Perry Green said he
[25:33] believes that time of day, that time of
[25:34] year, that's where that light came
[25:36] through to hit that sword. So, it was
[25:38] shining in the light right through
[25:40] there. And then that's just a 360 degree
[25:44] view of that. And then you'll see a
[25:46] little trail going along here. That's
[25:47] the trail we hiked out of the canyon on
[25:49] all the way back to the visitor center.
[25:51] And so that was wonderful. That was a
[25:55] wonderful time and I just appreciate you
[25:58] guys all giving me the privilege of
[26:00] going and spending a couple days down
[26:02] there. Feel like it was really good for
[26:04] me. It was really good to be away and be
[26:06] by myself actually because I could stay
[26:08] as long as I wanted. I wasn't worried
[26:10] about if somebody wanted to stay longer
[26:12] or go or see something else. I was just
[26:14] there and I could spend some time just
[26:16] walking around. And I mean there was no
[26:19] significant thing happened. No sword hit
[26:21] my hand when I was at Pulp Prick Rock
[26:23] because I'm not the prophet of the age.
[26:24] But I just felt privileged to see those
[26:26] things and to be there and you could see
[26:28] why he was attracted to that place. And
[26:30] you know, none of that was Brother
[26:31] Benham's idea. God put all that there
[26:34] for him to discover. And when when God
[26:36] was going to put the sword in his hand,
[26:38] he called him up to Sabino Canyon. He
[26:39] said, "Get you up to Sabino Canyon." And
[26:41] he went with a little tablet of paper.
[26:43] And so that was God's idea. So God chose
[26:46] that place for that reason. and I just
[26:49] really enjoyed being there. So, I stayed
[26:52] a couple days down there. Then coming
[26:54] back into Phoenix, I got to stop and
[26:55] visit Brother Aaron McGee and and
[26:57] they're doing really well. The church
[26:59] there is doing good and he sends back
[27:00] greetings and I'm hoping we get a chance
[27:02] to have him here sometime this year. And
[27:05] so, we'll see if that works out in the
[27:07] schedule at all. So, then um from there,
[27:10] we went to the meetings. The meeting
[27:12] started Friday. It was myself and
[27:14] brother Jason Watkins. He took the
[27:15] Friday night. I took Saturday morning.
[27:17] He had Saturday night and then um I had
[27:20] the Sunday morning service. And so it
[27:23] was really wonderful to see Jason again.
[27:24] I hadn't seen him and talked to him in
[27:26] quite a number of years. And brother
[27:27] Jason was very very influential for me
[27:30] early on when I first come to the
[27:32] message and he like I said he was quite
[27:34] involved in the church and in missions
[27:35] work and I just really always respected
[27:38] the brother and always uh enjoyed his
[27:40] ministry. So, it was really a privilege
[27:42] to get to see him and talk to him again.
[27:44] And we had a wonderful time there. And
[27:46] the meetings were fantastic. The
[27:47] atmosphere was good. And I want to
[27:50] appreciate all of you guys for praying.
[27:52] Many of you text me. You let me know and
[27:53] told me that you would be praying. And I
[27:55] certainly certainly felt it. It was it
[27:58] was wonderful. Um, it was a good time
[28:01] for me and I felt like the Lord really
[28:04] blessed it. And I'll tell you more about
[28:06] that as we get into the message because
[28:08] I'm I'm actually going to preach
[28:09] something that brother Jason preached.
[28:12] And I'm not going to preach the same
[28:13] thing, but it inspired something inside
[28:15] of me. And I just want to share that
[28:16] inspiration with you. Amen. Uh coming
[28:20] home, I was ready, you know, to relax
[28:22] and just ride. And I and I was uh first
[28:26] flight, I listened to both of the
[28:27] services that were preached here. Second
[28:28] flight, I just took out my Bible. I got
[28:30] a little bit smaller Bible I use when I
[28:32] travel. And I'm reading my Bible and I'm
[28:34] sitting there and then uh an older lady
[28:36] came and she sat next to me and we're I
[28:39] open my Bible and all of a sudden I
[28:40] heard her go, "Oh my I didn't know what
[28:43] happened." She goes, "I love it. I'm a
[28:46] Christian,
[28:47] too." I was like, "Yeah, praise the
[28:49] Lord." I mean, that's good. Cuz I was
[28:51] reading my Bible. She goes, "What
[28:52] version are you reading?" and I told her
[28:54] and she asked me questions and we just
[28:55] talked for a little bit, but then it was
[28:57] time to take off and then you had to go
[28:58] through all the uh the the security
[29:01] announcements and we took off and so I
[29:03] read a little bit and then I dozed off a
[29:05] little bit and I woke up and they were
[29:06] bringing the serving carts through
[29:08] giving drinks and and I started reading
[29:10] again and I'm reading and I can feel her
[29:12] watching me.
[29:15] She very nice lady and and and I I could
[29:20] just feel there's a question coming and
[29:23] I just closed my eyes and said, "Lord,
[29:24] help me." And all of a sudden uh and I
[29:27] just said, "Lord, I'm here for your
[29:28] use." And she asked a question and then
[29:31] one question led to another question,
[29:32] another question, another question,
[29:33] another question. And we went to we went
[29:35] through I mean, I can't even tell you
[29:37] how we got from where we were to where
[29:39] we were. And we covered so many things.
[29:41] And when we got to the end of it, she
[29:43] goes, she goes, "What Bible school did
[29:45] you go to?" I
[29:47] said, "So, I didn't go to Bible school."
[29:50] I said, "I was a mechanic when the Lord
[29:51] called me to the ministry." And she
[29:53] goes, "That's good." And so, she was
[29:55] raised Catholic and she was going to a
[29:57] non-denominational church. And we talked
[29:58] about that. But when we were done, when
[30:00] it was all done, she goes, "That is so
[30:03] beautiful the way you explain the
[30:04] scriptures. I never heard it explained
[30:06] like that." We were talking about the
[30:07] sacrifice of Jesus, the blood of Jesus,
[30:09] the life of Jesus and the life coming
[30:11] back to the church on the day of
[30:13] Pentecost and and all of these things.
[30:16] And so before we left, she asked what
[30:18] church, you know, I attended and where
[30:20] we were at and and she got the name. So
[30:22] I don't know what God will do, but it
[30:24] was a it was a pleasure just to share
[30:26] the word with somebody. And she was so
[30:28] excited and she so loved. And every time
[30:31] that happens to me, I so realize what we
[30:33] have is so precious.
[30:36] that just talking just the things that
[30:38] are simple, foundational, basic to us
[30:41] are lifechanging to other people. It was
[30:44] life-changing to us when we first heard
[30:46] it. But sometimes we forget how
[30:48] exceptional this word is and what an
[30:51] understanding we have of every
[30:53] everything goes deeper with the message.
[30:55] Every doctrine, every Christian
[30:57] doctrine, baptism, amen, uh uh the
[30:59] crucifixion, blood atonement, you you
[31:02] name it. anything you want to talk
[31:04] about, it goes so deep and rich and all
[31:06] over the place with the message. And so
[31:09] that was just a tremendous blessing. And
[31:10] so we just prayed that the Lord would
[31:12] bless her. And she was so respectful and
[31:14] so kind and so happy and so loved the
[31:16] word. We just prayed God's blessings be
[31:18] upon her as
[31:20] well. Amen. Let's all stand. I'd like to
[31:23] read a scripture. I'm not going to keep
[31:25] you all night. I intentionally brought
[31:27] very few notes to the pull pit. So
[31:29] that's either going to be really good or
[31:31] really bad.
[31:33] So, we're just going to pray that God
[31:35] has his way and we're going to relax and
[31:37] rest ourselves, you and I together, and
[31:39] we're going to see what what happens,
[31:41] what God wants to do. Uh, just before we
[31:43] turn to the scriptures, we're going to
[31:44] turn to Second Kings. So, if you want to
[31:46] turn to Second Kings, I just want to
[31:47] give you an update on Sister Karen Keer.
[31:49] I just spoke to her earlier today and
[31:51] she's doing well. She's recovering.
[31:53] They're at the hospital feeling better
[31:55] and uh she should get to go home
[31:57] tomorrow and it looks like her daughter
[31:59] will probably come in Friday and be able
[32:01] to stay some time with her. So just keep
[32:03] her in prayer that she makes a good full
[32:04] recovery, but she sounded great on the
[32:06] phone. She was in good spirits and it
[32:08] was good to talk to her. Also, I got
[32:11] word brother Jean Petri had a hip
[32:14] surgery uh while I was away too over the
[32:16] weekend. I think it was Thursday or
[32:18] Friday and he's recovering and the hip
[32:20] surgery went well. So just keep him in
[32:22] prayer as he recovers and just pray that
[32:24] the Lord will really touch him and bless
[32:27] him as well. Amen. Also, just before we
[32:30] read and pray, I want to give a special
[32:32] thank you to the trustees and all the
[32:34] brothers that helped them hang these
[32:36] panels in the back, these sound panels.
[32:38] I let you know that we we were going to
[32:40] do that, but when I came in, it was just
[32:42] beautiful. They did a good job. And it
[32:44] looks like they just did a few sound
[32:46] panels, but there's way more up above in
[32:49] the black area that you can't see than
[32:51] down below. I think there's 63 panels
[32:53] that they hung. They had a few helpers
[32:54] come and help them and they hung them
[32:56] all on Saturday. Did a fantastic job.
[32:58] And Brother Franco and Sister Amy are
[33:00] already seeing wonderful results and
[33:01] it's been a real blessing for the audio
[33:04] system. So, we want to appreciate all of
[33:06] them. God bless you all. Thank you all
[33:08] so much. Amen. They take care of things
[33:10] so much all the time and it goes
[33:12] unnoticed. I want to thank him whenever
[33:14] we get a chance to do that. Amen. So,
[33:17] let's look at 2 Kings 13. Let's go to
[33:20] chapter
[33:21] 13. 2 Kings
[33:28] 13 and verse
[33:31] 14. 2 Kings 13 and 14. Now Elisha was
[33:35] fallen sick of his sickness whereof he
[33:37] died. And Joash the king of Israel came
[33:40] down unto him, and wept over his face,
[33:42] and said, "Oh, my father, my father, the
[33:44] chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
[33:46] thereof." And Elisha said unto him,
[33:48] "Take bow and arrows." And he took unto
[33:50] him bow and arrows. And he said to the
[33:52] king of Israel, "Put thine hand upon the
[33:54] bow," and he put his hand upon it. And
[33:56] Elisha put his hands upon the king's
[33:58] hands, and he said, "Open the window
[34:00] eastward." And he opened it. Then Elisha
[34:02] said, "Shoot." And he shot. And he said,
[34:04] "The arrow of the Lord's deliverance and
[34:06] the arrow of deliverance from Syria, for
[34:09] thou shalt smite the Syrians and Aphek,
[34:11] till thou hath consumed them." And he
[34:14] said, "Take the arrows." And he took
[34:16] them. And he said unto the king of
[34:18] Israel, "Smite upon the ground, and he
[34:20] smoked thrice, and stayed." And the man
[34:22] of God was wroth with him, and said,
[34:24] "Thou shouldest have smitten five or six
[34:27] times. Then hast thou smitten Syria till
[34:30] thou hast consumed it. Whereas now thou
[34:32] shalt smite Syria, but thrice. Amen. God
[34:36] bless you as you have your seats and may
[34:38] the Lord help us as we look at his word
[34:39] and bless us with understanding and
[34:42] revelation. Amen.
[34:45] Amen. Brother uh Jason Watkins, he
[34:48] preached two services while we were
[34:49] there. The first one Friday night and
[34:52] then Saturday night. And I felt I felt
[34:54] for me both of those services were
[34:56] personally for me. I benefited so
[34:58] greatly from them and the things that he
[35:00] shared and the things that he said and
[35:02] especially the second service. The
[35:04] second service he preached on uh onward
[35:08] and upward. So I encourage you all to go
[35:10] listen to it if you hadn't. Amen. It was
[35:12] a real blessing for me uh onward and
[35:15] upward. And he come to the conclusion by
[35:17] the end of the service that that the
[35:19] only place for us to go is onward.
[35:22] There's no turning back. There's no
[35:23] going backwards. There's only forward
[35:25] progression. But at the end, he came to
[35:27] the conclusion, Amen. We all came to the
[35:29] conclusion together that onward is
[35:32] upward. That the only way to go upward
[35:34] is to go onward. And if you go onward,
[35:36] you're going upward. Amen. And we are
[35:38] here in the rapture season. And the
[35:40] bride goes up word by word. We're being
[35:42] lifted into another dimension by the
[35:44] word. And so the only way upward is
[35:47] onward.
[35:49] So onward is upward. And I was
[35:52] absolutely so blessed by the service.
[35:55] And uh as I was meditating, I had
[35:57] another subject I was going to preach
[35:58] when I got home and I was just so
[36:00] inspired traveling home and thinking
[36:02] about the services, I there was there
[36:04] was another thought the Lord shared with
[36:05] me that I just wanted to share with you.
[36:07] And so if you'll allow me to regurgitate
[36:09] what I've been eating on, Amen. We'll
[36:12] enjoy it all together.
[36:14] Amen. When you look here at at this
[36:17] story of
[36:19] Elisha, Elisha is going to be taken off
[36:22] the scene and Joash the king now
[36:24] understands that what we're losing is
[36:26] something terrific. Amen. We're losing
[36:28] the prophet. Amen. In this prophetic
[36:30] gift and he and he calls him the father
[36:33] of Israel and the horsemen thereof. He's
[36:35] the strength of Israel. He's the
[36:37] leadership, the headship and the
[36:38] strength. And they're losing this great
[36:41] prophet. And he tells him, "Take thy bow
[36:43] and thy arrow and open the window." And
[36:45] puts his hand upon it and they shoot.
[36:47] And he says, "This is the deliverance of
[36:50] the Lord. He's going to deliver you from
[36:51] your enemies. Deliver you from uh
[36:53] Syria." So he's got this great
[36:55] experience with the prophet where the
[36:56] prophet is prophesying his final
[36:59] prophecy to the king that this is the
[37:01] Lord's deliverance.
[37:03] And you think finished. Period. Done.
[37:06] This is the Lord's deliverance. But then
[37:08] he says, "Now take your arrows." Mhm.
[37:11] See, now this shooting the arrow was the
[37:13] with the assistance of Elisha, he put
[37:16] his hand upon the bow and his hand upon
[37:18] his hand and shoot and he shot. So with
[37:20] the guidance and assistance of Elisha,
[37:23] he shot the arrow and he said, "Now this
[37:24] is the deliverance from Israel." But now
[37:26] he says, "Take thy arrows and smite them
[37:28] up on the ground." So he took his arrows
[37:30] and he smoked them three times. Bang,
[37:33] bang, bang. And Elisha gets upset with
[37:36] him. Yeah. And he says,"Wh did you only
[37:39] smite it three times? You should have
[37:41] done it at least five or six times. So
[37:44] now you only have a partial victory.
[37:47] You only smite them three times, but you
[37:49] should have smoked more till you would
[37:50] have smoked them till you consumed your
[37:52] enemy."
[37:54] And we we we we look at this and say,
[37:56] "My, this is so how did he how would he
[37:58] have known? How would he how did he know
[38:01] what to do?" Or how many times what
[38:03] would I have done if I was in that
[38:05] position? How many times would I that
[38:07] the prophet didn't tell him what to do
[38:08] or how to do it? And can you imagine how
[38:11] heartsickening it would be for the
[38:13] prophet to tell you now you're not going
[38:15] to get it? Yeah. You missed it, right?
[38:18] Oh man, I can't imagine what that would
[38:20] be like. And you say, "What what what
[38:22] was happening here?" And you know,
[38:24] scripture has such depth of meaning. I
[38:26] don't know all that was happening here,
[38:28] but you see that that there was a
[38:30] deliverance coming and it looks like
[38:32] this deliverance coming. This is the
[38:33] hand of the Lord. The prophet is guiding
[38:35] us. He's showing us, shoot through the
[38:37] window. This is the deliverance of the
[38:38] Lord. And so that's God saying, "I will
[38:41] deliver you. Now you take your arrows
[38:43] and you smite them
[38:45] without without my hands on you, without
[38:48] me guiding you through the steps. You do
[38:50] what's in your heart." Yeah. Amen. And
[38:53] he smoked three times. And he says, "You
[38:56] now failed. You should have smoked five
[38:57] or six. Now it's partial delivery."
[38:59] Amen. showing that God is still in
[39:02] partnership with man.
[39:05] He promised the deliverance, but you
[39:07] we've got something to do with it.
[39:10] There's some part we play. There's
[39:12] something. And Joash, Amen, what Joash
[39:14] was showing, Amen. What to me what I see
[39:17] in this story, I'm not saying I have the
[39:19] interpretation, but what I see is
[39:21] Joash's heart, Amen, wasn't tied up with
[39:25] the prophecy in a way that he realized,
[39:28] amen, that I'm going to smite and smite
[39:30] and smite and smite and smite till it's
[39:32] completely gone. Amen. Some way there
[39:35] was some relaxness in his approach.
[39:39] And I want to take for a subject
[39:41] tonight, never stop.
[39:44] Never stop.
[39:46] I'm sure if Joish had another
[39:48] opportunity, he would go back and do it
[39:50] differently. Now, after reading this, if
[39:53] that same thing happened to me, do how
[39:56] many times would you smite the arrows?
[39:58] Well, he said at least five or six. I
[39:59] do. No, I would smite them till Elijah
[40:01] told me to stop. I would just, if you
[40:04] know the consequences, if you know how
[40:06] important this is, if you know what this
[40:07] matter, if you know this is full
[40:09] deliverance, you would just keep on
[40:11] going and keep on going till Elisha
[40:12] said, "That's enough." And I keep on
[40:14] going to said, "No, I'm serious. That's
[40:16] enough
[40:18] because our heart has to be tied in with
[40:20] the prophecy because we've got part of
[40:22] it. We got to get in the same vein. This
[40:24] is about deliverance. This is about full
[40:26] victory. This is about complete
[40:28] deliverance from our enemies."
[40:31] Amen. Brother Bam said in the message
[40:34] secondhanded robe, he said, "Then when
[40:36] Elijah, after his whole heart's desire
[40:38] was to get that promise, he wanted the
[40:40] promise. That was his motive. That was
[40:43] his his all. That was his life. That was
[40:45] his intent. Everything all everything
[40:48] hung on getting that promise. I'm
[40:50] persuaded to believe that we're not
[40:51] sincere about this thing that we're
[40:53] talking about. If your whole motives
[40:56] this morning rest upon giving God praise
[40:58] for healing, I'm determined to be healed
[41:00] by the power of God. I'm determined to
[41:02] live a Christian life. I'm determined to
[41:04] walk in peace with God. I'm determined
[41:06] to do it. I don't care what mother says,
[41:08] what church says, what pastor says, what
[41:10] anybody else says, what the world says.
[41:13] I'm determined. That's the singleness of
[41:16] my heart. You're going to get somewhere
[41:18] then.
[41:20] So, brother Bam shows us many times it's
[41:21] our attitude towards something that
[41:24] matters. It's not just to say, well, God
[41:27] said and the prophet said, and this is
[41:29] going to be deliverance, but Joash had a
[41:31] certain attitude towards that
[41:33] deliverance that was exposed.
[41:36] And Elisha was saying you your attitude
[41:39] should have been different. Your
[41:40] approach should have been different.
[41:41] Your sincerity, your drive, your
[41:43] earnestness, your desire should have
[41:45] been different. And brother Brandham
[41:46] comes and shows us that that kind of
[41:49] singleness of heart. I'm going through
[41:51] no matter what. I'm determined to serve
[41:53] God. I'm determined to be healed by the
[41:55] power of God. I'm determined to live a
[41:57] Christian life. I'm determined to walk
[41:58] in peace with God. I'm determined to do
[42:00] it. I don't care about mother or church
[42:02] or pastor. I'm determined.
[42:04] He said, "That's the singleness of my
[42:06] heart. You're going to get somewhere
[42:09] then." We know that when the children of
[42:14] Israel were coming into the promised
[42:15] land, Moses had made a promise to them.
[42:18] And Joshua comes and verifies the
[42:21] promise as they're getting ready to
[42:22] cross over. And God speaks to Moses or
[42:26] God speaks to uh uh Joshua. And this is
[42:29] Joshua 1:2. I'll just read it to you.
[42:31] Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore
[42:35] arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all
[42:38] this people, unto the land which I do
[42:40] give to them, even to the children of
[42:42] Israel. Every place that the soul of
[42:44] your foot shall tread upon, that have I
[42:47] given you as I said unto Moses. This is
[42:50] where brother Brandham picks this up.
[42:52] This this uh word of the Lord coming to
[42:54] Joshua and Joshua shares this with the
[42:56] camp. And brother Brandham picks this up
[42:58] and he says, "God told them way down in
[43:01] Egypt, I give you that land." But he
[43:03] didn't say, "I'll go out there and sweep
[43:04] it all out and garnish the houses and
[43:06] hang up the curtains and everything. You
[43:08] all just move in." No. No. They had to
[43:10] fight for every inch of ground they
[43:11] took. That's right. Fighting and taking
[43:13] it by every fight, every inch.
[43:16] Everywhere the souls of your foot land,
[43:18] that's possession. Footsteps is
[43:20] possession. That's the same thing it is
[43:22] today. Divine healing belongs to us. The
[43:24] Holy Spirit belongs to us. It's our
[43:26] property, but you'll fight every inch of
[43:28] it. Yes, sir. But brother, footsteps is
[43:31] possession. Just keep fighting. Take it.
[43:35] So, all of a sudden, we we realize he's
[43:37] saying now uh he God told uh uh uh
[43:41] Joshua, every place the soul of your
[43:43] feet shall land, I have given to
[43:46] you. So, that's where brother Rang gets
[43:49] footsteps his possession. Yeah. If you
[43:52] can press into it, you can have it.
[43:54] Yeah. And the same thing's true
[43:56] spiritually for us. If we can press into
[43:59] it, we can have it. All that has been
[44:02] promised to us. And and brother Bam said
[44:04] by the message of the hour, he's opened
[44:05] up a new land for us. So this new land,
[44:08] the restoration of the word, it's been
[44:10] open to us. And we can have everything
[44:13] that's in the message if we can press
[44:15] our way into it because footsteps are
[44:16] possession. He said, "I've given it to
[44:18] you. It's yours. I'll drive them out.
[44:20] You move in." Amen. Is this this is
[44:23] teamwork again. Amen. But we know that
[44:28] they failed to fully possess the land.
[44:30] None of these things are new to us. So
[44:32] don't don't wait for me to say something
[44:34] new because none of this is new. We've
[44:35] preached on all this before, but it says
[44:37] in Judges 1:28, "And it come to pass
[44:40] when Israel was strong that they put the
[44:42] Canaanites to tribute and did not
[44:45] utterly drive them out."
[44:47] They didn't take full possession of the
[44:49] land and they didn't utterly drive out
[44:50] the inhabitants, which is what they were
[44:52] commanded to do. They stopped short
[44:54] somewhere along the way. Amen. They got
[44:56] tired of fighting and they tried. And if
[44:58] you go to Judges, it says, "And Manasseh
[45:01] could not fully drive out this one." And
[45:03] and and Judah could not fully drive out
[45:05] this one. And and each of the tribes
[45:06] were given a certain area to fully
[45:08] possess. And each one of them failed in
[45:10] some way. They could take they could
[45:12] take the valleys, but they couldn't take
[45:13] the mountains or however. I don't
[45:15] remember how it all worked out, but
[45:16] there was there was a a a lack of full
[45:19] success of a full taking of the land.
[45:21] Amen. All around. So what they did,
[45:24] Amen. Because it got so difficult to
[45:26] keep trying. Amen. And they they could
[45:28] not, it says they could not, right? They
[45:32] could not drive out the Canaanites. They
[45:34] could not fully possess the land. But
[45:36] that could not doesn't match the
[45:38] scriptures.
[45:40] Says, "For I've given it to you and I'll
[45:41] drive them out wherever the souls of
[45:43] your foot." Amen. They might have failed
[45:46] a dozen times, but a dozen failures
[45:48] doesn't mean you can't do it. Amen.
[45:53] Amen. They would have eventually got to
[45:55] it because God promised them. Amen. I
[45:57] don't know why it was so difficult or
[45:59] what God was allowing. Amen. But there
[46:01] had to be some amount of perseverance.
[46:03] There had to be some amount of pressing
[46:05] through. There be had to be a bit of a
[46:07] determination to see the word of God
[46:09] kept. Amen.
[46:11] And so they they then put them under
[46:18] tribute. So to me that's
[46:21] amazing. They said, "Okay, this is too
[46:24] hard. We're losing people in every
[46:26] battle and and we're constantly coming
[46:28] and we're constantly having warfare and
[46:31] and we're trying." And I don't know how
[46:32] many times they would try and get pushed
[46:34] back by the enemy and they were
[46:36] entrenched in the hills or whatever and
[46:38] the stony places or caves and and they
[46:40] couldn't drive them all out. So they
[46:42] finally come up with a truce and they
[46:43] said, "Listen, you stay over there and
[46:45] we'll stay over here. We'll leave you
[46:47] alone. You leave us alone. You pay us a
[46:49] tribute and we won't destroy you." And
[46:51] all of a sudden that settled down into
[46:53] what seemed like
[46:55] peace out. But in the end, he says,
[46:59] "There'll be thorns in your flesh and
[47:01] pricks in your eye."
[47:03] And that's exactly what happened. What
[47:05] ended up destroying them was the thing
[47:07] that they allowed to remain.
[47:10] Yes. And listen, I I can't blame
[47:15] them. How many get tired of fighting?
[47:18] Anybody ever get tired of fighting? You
[47:21] get tired of going around the same
[47:22] stump. You get tired of facing the same
[47:24] situations over and over again. We can
[47:27] look back at them and say, "Didn't you
[47:29] hear what Moses said? Didn't you know
[47:31] the promises? If you would have just
[47:32] pushed a little harder." Hey, we're
[47:34] sitting from a vantage point looking
[47:35] back, drinking coffee, reading the
[47:37] Bible, saying, "You should have went a
[47:39] little further. What's wrong with you
[47:41] guys?"
[47:44] Amen. I'm a huge critic of these people
[47:47] in the Bible. As I sit with my feet
[47:50] propped up in an easy chair with a cup
[47:52] of coffee on a stand next to me and
[47:54] everything in order around my house.
[47:55] Amen. and and and and the AC just right
[47:58] and the heat just right and the fire
[48:00] going just so cozy. I say, "What's wrong
[48:02] with you people? You should have drove
[48:04] out the Canaanites. You didn't fully
[48:06] possess the land.
[48:16] put their feet up and read the Bible
[48:23] and they were getting tired of fighting
[48:24] and the the strain was too much and they
[48:27] got wore out and they got tired and they
[48:29] had other things other business to
[48:31] attend to. They wanted the the land that
[48:33] they had given. It was rich. It was a
[48:35] rich land. They wanted to cultivate it
[48:36] and farm it and start getting all the
[48:38] benefit and blessings out of it. They
[48:39] didn't want to keep going back and
[48:40] fighting and losing soldiers and getting
[48:42] cut and being tired
[48:44] and Right. Right. So they started
[48:47] setting up farming
[48:49] and that was theirs to do. That was
[48:50] their land. But they were supposed to
[48:52] drive out the
[48:55] inhabitants. Amen. And
[48:59] when they when they
[49:02] stopped really what they they did with
[49:06] this uh
[49:08] tribute really what they did was just
[49:10] hit the pause button.
[49:13] Let's just stop. Okay, let's make a deal
[49:17] because we're getting tired.
[49:21] You
[49:22] know, I've spent a lot of my Christian
[49:25] life looking for the pause button.
[49:28] Why does it seem like trials come in
[49:31] twos or threes,
[49:33] not just one at a time? Everybody,
[49:34] anybody ever got hit by a wave of
[49:36] trials? It was almost like I I've got to
[49:40] be Job. There has got to have been some
[49:42] conference in heaven because there is no
[49:44] way on the same day this can show up and
[49:46] this can show up in the same week the
[49:48] car breaks down and the furnace goes
[49:50] out. Come on.
[49:52] That's right. Amen. Amen. So, it comes
[49:56] in waves and we struggle. We want to hit
[49:58] the pause button, but hey, guess what?
[50:00] You don't get to hit the buttons. Only
[50:02] God gets to hit the buttons. Amen. And
[50:04] if and if God and and sometimes it feels
[50:07] like he must have hit fast forward on
[50:09] the trial button. I mean, they're coming
[50:11] in so fast I can't catch my breath.
[50:13] Amen. But listen, we don't get to
[50:15] control that. Only God gets to control
[50:17] that. The only thing we get to control
[50:18] is our response.
[50:21] We don't get to control what happens or
[50:23] how it happens or what God decides to do
[50:25] or how fast or how slow. And he doesn't
[50:27] do anything wrong. Amen. And nothing's
[50:29] out of kilter and everything's right on
[50:31] time and everything's perfect. Amen. The
[50:34] the only thing that we can control is
[50:36] how we respond to the things that are
[50:37] happening around us. Amen.
[50:40] Amen. I think part of what uh what
[50:44] blessed me so much about uh both of
[50:47] brother Jason's services is they were
[50:49] just such an encouragement to me. He
[50:51] preached on abiding in Christ and then
[50:53] he preached on uh onward and upward. And
[50:56] at the end of onward and upward, I I
[50:58] just I had this thought that strikes me.
[51:01] I said, "As children of God," I said,
[51:03] "The only way we lose is if we quit."
[51:05] Amen. That's what hit my heart. That's
[51:08] what And that's what I wanted to bring
[51:10] to you. The only way we lose is if we
[51:13] quit. Amen. Because we have precious
[51:16] promises. He's told us we'll be
[51:17] overcomers. He told us he'll be with us.
[51:19] He told us he'll be in us. He told us,
[51:21] Amen. Our our name's in the book. Amen.
[51:24] And we know that. I mean, we we know we
[51:26] can't quit. We know that if it's
[51:28] determined by in heaven before we're
[51:30] going to get there. But really, that's
[51:31] the that's the issue. That's what I my
[51:33] takeaway was the only way that we can
[51:36] lose is if we quit.
[51:40] Amen. So, what is the devil trying to
[51:42] get us to do probably more than anything
[51:44] else?
[51:46] Just hit the pause button, man.
[51:49] This is too much. It's too overwhelming.
[51:51] It's coming too fast. You can't deal
[51:53] with all these things. Just check out
[51:55] for a little while. That's right. Has
[51:57] anybody ever checked out?
[52:01] It doesn't do us any good, does it?
[52:04] Amen. How many ever checked out from
[52:06] serving God or checked out from coming
[52:07] to church? It got overwhelming. It got
[52:09] discouraging. It got too much. I
[52:11] couldn't handle it. And all I wanted was
[52:13] just I just wanted a pause. I just
[52:15] wanted to hit the pause button and take
[52:16] a break because it was overwhelming.
[52:18] Amen. But once you hit that pause
[52:19] button, when you go to hit play, you got
[52:22] so much catching up to do. You don't
[52:23] realize the pain that pause causes.
[52:26] Yeah. And any of us who have pause, we
[52:29] realize it's pain, amen, to get back.
[52:32] And one thing that brother Jason said
[52:33] that really struck me, he said the world
[52:35] is moving away from God so fast. Amen.
[52:38] That you don't you don't have to go
[52:39] backwards to backslide if you stop
[52:41] moving forward. He said it's like he
[52:43] said it's like being on conveyor belt.
[52:45] You go back so fast. Yeah. And that's
[52:48] the way the world is and the spirits
[52:49] have been unleashed. Amen. And Satan's
[52:51] eating to take us away. If we stop
[52:53] moving forward, if we quit constantly
[52:56] moving forward and striving for the
[52:57] things of God and just hit pause, before
[53:00] you know it, you're in places you never
[53:02] dreamed you would be.
[53:04] Amen. And it so encouraged me because I
[53:07] I told Jason afterwards, I said,
[53:09] "Brother, that was so good for me
[53:10] because I've been struggling and
[53:12] fighting with discouragement for the
[53:14] last year so badly in my personal life.
[53:17] So bad. And I've had so many times that
[53:19] I've just discouraged, just completely
[53:22] discouraged. And I I just I've been in
[53:25] the back there crying. I don't want to
[53:26] come out and preach. Crying, saying,
[53:29] "God, I don't want to go to the pull
[53:31] pit. Lord, I'm not fit to preach because
[53:34] I'm so
[53:36] discouraged." And I'll come out, you
[53:38] pull, and God delivers the word. Amen.
[53:42] But but God was so blessing me during
[53:45] the service. And I was I left so
[53:47] encouraged
[53:49] that I realized the only way we can lose
[53:51] is if we stop. And the only thing the
[53:53] devil's trying to get us to do is stop.
[53:57] Just stop. Listen, this is too much.
[53:59] This fighting, this striving for the
[54:02] spiritual thing is too much. This moving
[54:05] forward all the time. Hey man, how can
[54:07] you be expected to keep moving forward
[54:09] in the face of all these obstacles?
[54:12] Just take yourself a little, you know,
[54:15] you know what you need? You need a
[54:16] mental health
[54:20] day. I guess that's a thing now in
[54:22] corporate world. You can take mental
[54:23] health days. My goodness, I would take a
[54:26] whole slew of mental health
[54:28] days to get away from the torment that
[54:31] sometimes goes on in our
[54:33] minds. But you realize the devil does
[54:36] not want us to keep moving forward
[54:38] because forward movement is upward
[54:40] movement. And every time we move
[54:42] forward, footsteps are possession and
[54:43] he's losing ground. Amen. Who is it that
[54:46] wants you to stop moving? Amen. Your
[54:48] enemy wants you to stop moving. He wants
[54:50] you to put you under a truce. Amen.
[54:52] Let's just make a deal. I'll stop
[54:54] pushing back so hard at you if you just
[54:56] stop. Yeah. Oh, what a slick little deal
[55:00] that is. Amen. Because then, Amen.
[55:03] You'll not you're not going to stay in
[55:04] that condition when you go to get back
[55:06] on. Oh my goodness. You you got there's
[55:08] there's a price to pay, friends. And he
[55:11] knows that. And all he wants is you to
[55:13] slow down and quit putting the pressure
[55:15] on his kingdom so much. Amen. Because
[55:17] you got to you got to stop this forward
[55:19] progress in the spiritual realm because
[55:21] every time you progress forward, he's
[55:22] losing something.
[55:25] So if you could just time out, just time
[55:27] out. And I and I've come to the place
[55:28] where I said no timeouts. Amen. You
[55:31] don't get a timeout because God never
[55:33] told me timeout. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. Now,
[55:37] that doesn't mean that you can't go to
[55:39] Sabino Canyon and go hiking for a day.
[55:41] Listen, that was really nice. But that
[55:44] wasn't a spiritual time out.
[55:47] That wasn't a I'm too tired to pray and
[55:49] I'm done. I'm overwhelmed and I'm just
[55:51] checking out and I'm not reading. I'm
[55:53] not listening. I'm not going to church.
[55:55] I'm just I'm checked out because I'm
[55:56] overwhelmed. It wasn't one of those. You
[55:58] can take vacations, friends. You can go
[56:00] rest with your family. You can go rest
[56:02] your body. The prophet had to.
[56:04] That's right. But don't ever take a
[56:07] spiritual break. Never, never take a
[56:09] spiritual break. Our goal is to grow
[56:11] every day to learn to to surrender to
[56:14] give God uh more of ourselves so he can
[56:17] take more control of us. Amen. No time
[56:20] out spiritually.
[56:23] Amen. Listen friends, I have cried for a
[56:26] pause button
[56:28] in the spiritual realm. I've laid in bed
[56:31] and cried, "Lord, I can't take another
[56:33] second." But guess what? God apparently
[56:37] knew more than I did. Because he said,
[56:40] "He'll never put on you more than you
[56:42] can bear."
[56:44] And in every child will make a way of
[56:46] escape. What is the way of escape? He's
[56:48] the way of escape. Amen. Amen. Our rest
[56:52] is in him.
[56:54] Our rest is in the security that he
[56:57] gives us, the promise that he gives us
[56:58] that no matter what's going on, it'll
[57:01] never fail. We can never fail because
[57:04] his plan, his thoughts towards us can
[57:06] never fail. So, I was absolutely so
[57:11] encouraged
[57:12] uh this this past weekend.
[57:16] Jesus told his disciples that you'll be
[57:18] hated of all men for my sake, but he
[57:20] that endureth to the end shall be saved.
[57:24] Amen. So who gets saved? He that endures
[57:27] to the end.
[57:29] So we've got to endure to the end. I'm
[57:34] not here to run a sprint. I would lose.
[57:38] I'm talking spiritually. We have some
[57:40] We've seen I mean, if you've been around
[57:42] for a while, you've seen many that are
[57:43] like a flash in the pan. are super duper
[57:45] spiritual. They have gifts. They have
[57:48] things and they're like a flash in the
[57:49] pan and next thing you know they're
[57:50] gone. Yeah. They can sprint. They can
[57:53] run like nobody's business, but they're
[57:55] all the time in and out and up and down
[57:57] and back and forth and they're good for
[57:58] a while. Then they checked out
[57:59] completely and then they've got to get
[58:01] back on and they're checked out
[58:02] completely. Amen. And they can be super
[58:04] duper spiritual. Amen. And they can they
[58:06] can run well. Amen. But but they check
[58:09] out.
[58:12] And I was thinking of the story of the
[58:14] tortoise and the hair. I told you I'm
[58:16] preaching deep today, friends. Just hang
[58:19] on tight.
[58:21] The tortoise and the hair. The hair
[58:24] could outrun the tortoise. Like he could
[58:26] run circles around the tortoise. The
[58:28] problem with the hair is is the problem
[58:30] would take a timeout. The hair would
[58:32] take a timeout, right? because he was so
[58:35] good at running and he was so skilled
[58:38] and he was so much better than the
[58:39] tortoise that he had time to rest. He
[58:42] had time to check out. He had time to
[58:44] not worry about anything cuz it was
[58:46] going to be okay. Amen. But the
[58:48] tortoise, Amen. He He wasn't flashy.
[58:52] Nobody Nobody was crowding around to see
[58:55] what great thing he was going to do next
[58:57] cuz the same thing he did yesterday was
[58:59] the same thing he's going to do
[59:00] tomorrow. Amen. The same way he walked
[59:02] five minutes ago. Hey, listen. It's not
[59:04] changing. Yeah. Yes.
[59:07] Amen. Amen. I mean, the hair can do back
[59:10] flips and he can zigzag and I mean, it's
[59:12] fun to watch. The tortoise ain't no fun
[59:14] to watch. It's like, oh, did you see
[59:17] that? He stretched out a little further
[59:19] that time.
[59:26] How many of you have read the story to
[59:28] your kids, the tortoise and the hair?
[59:30] How many times have you read it? Amen.
[59:32] Who wins every time?
[59:37] No matter how many times you read it,
[59:40] the tortoise always wins. Why does the
[59:43] tortoise win? Because he never stops.
[59:48] Not because he's the best, not because
[59:50] he's the greatest, not because he's got
[59:52] all the skill and all the ability and
[59:54] he's the most spiritual in the whole
[59:55] world and he's flashy. And listen,
[59:57] nobody's writing books about the
[59:59] technique of the tortoise.
[1:00:01] his running style and he's not getting,
[1:00:04] you know, Nike is not sponsoring the
[1:00:06] tortoise,
[1:00:10] but he wins every time because he never
[1:00:13] quits. Amen. Listen, it doesn't matter.
[1:00:16] We don't have to make this look good
[1:00:18] spiritually. We don't have to be the
[1:00:20] flashiest with the best, the most
[1:00:21] skills, the most dynamic this. We don't
[1:00:23] have to have anybody that's wanting to
[1:00:25] even emulate us or be like us. All we've
[1:00:27] got to do is set our face towards the
[1:00:29] goal and just keep moving forward in the
[1:00:32] things of God. And if we don't quit, we
[1:00:34] win. Amen. Why do we win? Because he
[1:00:37] promised we would win. Amen. Nobody can
[1:00:39] defeat us. No devil in hell can stop
[1:00:42] God's purpose. The only thing that can
[1:00:43] hurt us is us.
[1:00:49] Amen. Hebrews
[1:00:51] 10:38 says, "Now the just shall live by
[1:00:54] faith, but any man draw back, my soul
[1:00:58] shall have no pleasure in him. But we
[1:01:00] are not of them who draw back into
[1:01:01] predition, but of them that believe to
[1:01:04] the saving of the soul." Amen. Believe
[1:01:06] when it's not convenient to believe.
[1:01:08] Believe when it doesn't feel good to
[1:01:09] believe. Move forward when it doesn't
[1:01:11] feel good to move forward. That's right.
[1:01:15] Brother Bam said
[1:01:17] uh and the greatest news flash in
[1:01:20] history said remember God told Joshua
[1:01:22] every place the souls of your footsteps
[1:01:24] that's possession brother them footsteps
[1:01:26] means possession let's just keep walking
[1:01:28] into the promised land not looking back
[1:01:30] to see what will happen back there and
[1:01:32] what somebody else is doing keep your
[1:01:34] eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader just
[1:01:37] keep moving on deeper depths higher
[1:01:39] heights until you possess everything
[1:01:41] that God promised you in his word. Amen.
[1:01:45] It doesn't matter what's going on
[1:01:47] anywhere else. Don't look anywhere else.
[1:01:48] Look to Christ. Amen.
[1:01:51] Amen. But this one, this What's that to
[1:01:53] thee? Follow thou me. Amen. But what
[1:01:55] about this that what's that to thee?
[1:01:57] Follow thou me. What does it matter
[1:01:59] what's happening with anybody else or
[1:02:02] any other family or any other church or
[1:02:04] any other believers? What does that have
[1:02:06] to do with you following Christ?
[1:02:10] Amen.
[1:02:14] But when we were I may have told you
[1:02:17] guys this already. I can't remember
[1:02:18] sometimes what I say and don't say. So
[1:02:20] forgive me if I repeat a bunch. We'll
[1:02:23] just believe God wanted you to hear it.
[1:02:24] That sounds good. That's a really nice
[1:02:26] thing to say. I repeated that cuz God
[1:02:28] wanted you to hear it. That makes me
[1:02:30] feel better.
[1:02:31] Anyways, but when we were uh uh had
[1:02:34] taken brother Dave and Sister Bessie
[1:02:36] Wood out to dinner, the deacons and and
[1:02:38] our wives and myself and my wife and we
[1:02:41] had asked him some of the comment on the
[1:02:43] last 47 years and he one of the things
[1:02:46] that he told us he said there was many
[1:02:48] many many days I didn't feel like going
[1:02:51] to
[1:02:51] church. He said I would be tired things
[1:02:54] wouldn't be going wrong. I would I would
[1:02:55] feel well. There was problems in the
[1:02:57] church. There was issues at home. There
[1:02:59] was many times I just didn't feel like
[1:03:01] going to church. He said, "But I didn't
[1:03:03] have an option. I was a deacon."
[1:03:06] And he said, "The best thing that ever
[1:03:08] happened to me is I didn't have an
[1:03:09] option." Amen. He said, "It was many
[1:03:12] times when I was the worst or at my
[1:03:14] lowest that I got blessed the most."
[1:03:16] Amen. That's right. Does anybody else
[1:03:18] have that experience?
[1:03:20] Yeah. Amen. And I had the same thought
[1:03:23] because there's many, many, many times,
[1:03:26] friends, I didn't want to come to
[1:03:27] church.
[1:03:29] Many times you say it's not right.
[1:03:31] You're the pastor. I listen. You try it
[1:03:33] for a week and you tell
[1:03:35] me what.
[1:03:37] We'll trade places for a month and then
[1:03:39] there'll be no more critical thoughts in
[1:03:41] your mind.
[1:03:43] When you've been criticized, when people
[1:03:45] have misjudged your statements and
[1:03:47] misjudged your character and
[1:03:48] misunderstood the direction you're going
[1:03:50] in. Hey, listen. You don't feel like
[1:03:52] getting up and doing it all again. So,
[1:03:54] there many times I didn't feel like
[1:03:56] coming to church, but guess what? I had
[1:03:57] no option. You know, the best thing that
[1:04:00] ever happened to me is I had no option.
[1:04:02] Amen. Because what I find is that God's
[1:04:05] always there and God's always faithful
[1:04:07] and he he always keeps his word. And if
[1:04:09] I would check out and hold back and time
[1:04:11] out and pull back, guess what? I would
[1:04:14] be the one who suffers for it. But God
[1:04:16] did something super special for me. And
[1:04:18] he took away my options. And I thank God
[1:04:20] he took away my options because it's
[1:04:21] been a good thing for me, friends. Amen.
[1:04:24] And I encourage you, take away your
[1:04:25] options. Yeah. Amen. Just take away your
[1:04:29] options and say, "Listen, I don't have
[1:04:31] an option." Brother Brandham said,
[1:04:32] "That's my post of duty. I'm going to my
[1:04:34] post of duty. I'm doing away with
[1:04:36] options." Why? Because Brother Brenham
[1:04:38] said, "You show the devil whose side
[1:04:39] you're on. You're a teammate. We're in
[1:04:41] this team together." And all the
[1:04:43] teammates need to be here together. Not
[1:04:45] for, hey, listen, we can say, I've told
[1:04:48] you about Brother David myself. And the
[1:04:50] truth is, Amen. We were the benefactors
[1:04:52] of doing that. But we weren't the only
[1:04:54] benefactors of doing that because when
[1:04:56] we showed up, you were blessed, too. And
[1:04:59] you think that you can disappear and
[1:05:01] vanish and it not affect the people that
[1:05:03] are around you, right?
[1:05:07] Would you rather be in a full church or
[1:05:08] an empty church? What's a better
[1:05:10] atmosphere?
[1:05:11] Would you rather sit on a pew all by
[1:05:13] yourself with nobody else around you?
[1:05:14] Would you rather have brothers and
[1:05:15] sisters amening and pulling and creating
[1:05:17] an atmosphere? Then that's going to take
[1:05:19] every one of us at our post of duty
[1:05:21] realizing I don't get a timeout. I don't
[1:05:24] get Yeah, I got my feelings hurt. Guess
[1:05:26] what? It's going to happen again. They
[1:05:27] misunderstood me. They said something.
[1:05:29] Well, grow up.
[1:05:32] Paul looked at Timothy. He said, "Endure
[1:05:34] hardness as a soldier of Jesus Christ."
[1:05:38] So, are we soldiers or pansies? Are we
[1:05:41] hot bed plants? Are we real rugged,
[1:05:43] genuine Christians that can get our toes
[1:05:45] stomped on, can get spit in the face,
[1:05:47] and come right back? Amen.
[1:05:51] Amen. At some point, this bride's got to
[1:05:53] grow up. Amen. Can't hide out because we
[1:05:57] got our feelings hurt or they
[1:05:58] misunderstood me. Listen, I've had my
[1:06:00] feelings hurt. I've been misunderstood.
[1:06:02] I've been lied about. I've been
[1:06:04] misrepresented.
[1:06:07] And if I didn't have an option, I would
[1:06:08] have quit.
[1:06:11] But God blessed me with no option. And
[1:06:15] it's been the greatest thing that ever
[1:06:17] happened to me. Thank you, Lord. You
[1:06:19] ever have those days where you're so low
[1:06:22] down you can't hardly get out of bed and
[1:06:23] what you want to do is pull the covers
[1:06:25] back over your head and lay there all
[1:06:28] day. I've had those days and had to come
[1:06:32] and preach.
[1:06:35] And you think it's fair for you to stay
[1:06:37] home when you don't feel
[1:06:39] good? Right.
[1:06:41] We're either all in this together or
[1:06:43] we're not. We're either going to have a
[1:06:45] denomination or we're going to be bride.
[1:06:47] The denomination says, "The pastor's
[1:06:49] there. That's good enough. I don't need
[1:06:51] to be there. I can come and go when I
[1:06:52] want." Yeah. Right. That's
[1:06:55] denominationalism. That's the church
[1:06:56] structure. But when you know where God's
[1:06:58] placed you and where you belong and what
[1:07:00] he's put you in, then you've got a
[1:07:02] position by God and a place and a
[1:07:05] responsibility.
[1:07:10] and you'll benefit from it.
[1:07:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:16] Sometimes we just have to push past
[1:07:18] ourselves. What keeps getting in the
[1:07:20] way? I'm tired of fighting.
[1:07:23] I'm tired. Well, listen. I believe
[1:07:26] you. Tired. I'm tired. I get really
[1:07:30] tired sometimes. But praise God.
[1:07:33] Sometimes when I'm so tired, listen,
[1:07:35] I've had times when I'm as tired as
[1:07:36] tired can be. mentally shot in the back
[1:07:39] crying said, "God, I'm not even fit to
[1:07:40] preach your word. I'm so messed up in my
[1:07:42] mind. I'll come out and that'll be the
[1:07:44] most dynamic service we have ever had."
[1:07:46] And I walk away going, "What just
[1:07:50] happened? What just happened?" Why? Cuz
[1:07:52] God's faithful to his word. He's
[1:07:54] faithful to his promise. He doesn't ever
[1:07:56] ask you to do something and not show up
[1:07:57] to bless you when you do it. He doesn't
[1:07:59] ask you, Amen, to be involved and be
[1:08:02] engaged and be part of something
[1:08:03] something more than yourself. Something
[1:08:05] bigger than yourself, something beyond
[1:08:07] just you. Amen. But you know what? The
[1:08:09] devil tries to get us to see just
[1:08:11] ourselves.
[1:08:13] I'm tired. I'm sick. I don't feel good.
[1:08:16] I
[1:08:17] Amen. But what about the person who's
[1:08:19] going to sit next to you in church?
[1:08:23] What about somebody who needs your lick
[1:08:24] of fire to spark their lick of fire?
[1:08:27] What about the visitors that's going to
[1:08:28] show up that day and need somebody to
[1:08:30] pull on the word to pull something out
[1:08:32] of the preacher? You realize, brother
[1:08:34] Bam said, the revival doesn't come in
[1:08:35] the briefcase of the pastor. Amen. It
[1:08:37] takes all of us working together.
[1:08:40] Are we going to work together? Are we
[1:08:42] going to be selfish and and sulk and
[1:08:44] suck our thumbs? And
[1:08:49] listen, I would apologize for talking
[1:08:51] this way, but I can't because this is
[1:08:52] the way God's been talking to me.
[1:08:57] These are the conversations that are
[1:08:59] going on in my head. Amen. Yeah.
[1:09:04] We claim to have the message. God's
[1:09:05] given us a prophet. The word is
[1:09:07] restored. How can we still act like
[1:09:09] children? Amen. When we come to this
[1:09:12] place,
[1:09:14] we've got to keep pressing forward,
[1:09:16] friends. There's no pause. There's no
[1:09:20] quit. There's no time out from serving
[1:09:22] God. That's right.
[1:09:26] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:29] Praise be to God.
[1:09:33] The only way we lose is if we
[1:09:37] quit. Luke 18. Let's turn there
[1:09:39] together. Luke 18.
[1:10:06] Luke 18
[1:10:10] verse1 and he spake a parable unto them
[1:10:13] to this end that men ought always to
[1:10:15] pray and not to faint. So this is what
[1:10:18] God wants us to learn. Yeah. Men are
[1:10:21] always to pray and not to faint. That
[1:10:23] means grow weary and get too tired.
[1:10:25] Amen. Saying there was in a city a judge
[1:10:28] which feared not God neither regarded
[1:10:30] man. And there was a widow in that city
[1:10:32] and she came into him saying, "Avenge me
[1:10:34] of mine adversary." And he would not for
[1:10:37] a while but afterward he said within
[1:10:38] himself, "Though I fear not God, nor
[1:10:40] regard man, yet because this widow
[1:10:42] troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by
[1:10:45] her continual coming she wear weary me."
[1:10:48] And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[1:10:50] judge saith saith." And shall not God
[1:10:52] avenge his own elect, which cry day and
[1:10:54] night unto him, though he bear long with
[1:10:56] them. I tell you that he will avenge
[1:10:58] them speedily. Nevertheless, when the
[1:11:00] Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith
[1:11:03] on the earth. Brother Ram said, "Cry for
[1:11:06] your needs. That's God's provided way."
[1:11:08] Didn't Jesus explain it when he said the
[1:11:11] unjust judge to the woman that cried day
[1:11:13] and night. How much more will the
[1:11:15] heavenly father give them the spirit who
[1:11:17] cry out for it day and night? Seek, keep
[1:11:20] seeking. Amen. Knock. Keep knocking.
[1:11:24] Just keep on till he opens. Stay out
[1:11:27] with it. Cry until the promised word is
[1:11:29] vindicated. Then you got it. You don't
[1:11:31] have to worry no more. You see, the
[1:11:33] Bible promised it. Then stay right there
[1:11:35] and cry until you get it. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:39] We're not of those who draw
[1:11:41] back. Those who endure to the end are
[1:11:43] saved. Those who keep pressing. That
[1:11:45] widow woman didn't just go and trouble
[1:11:47] the judge once. Yeah. And say, "You know
[1:11:50] what? Apparently, he's not going to give
[1:11:52] it to me." She persisted and persisted
[1:11:54] and persisted until he says, "Listen, I
[1:11:57] don't fear God. I don't fear man, but
[1:11:59] because she troubleth." And God says,
[1:12:01] "I'm teaching you this so you learn how
[1:12:03] to pray without
[1:12:05] fainting. Yeah. Amen. That's the whole
[1:12:09] point of the parable so that we learn
[1:12:10] how to stick with it till we get it. To
[1:12:13] cry like a baby said a baby cries till
[1:12:15] it gets satisfied. Amen. Cry until the
[1:12:19] promise is finicated. Amen. Brother Bam
[1:12:23] says that little woman and this is
[1:12:25] another quote in all things. That little
[1:12:26] woman with the blood issue has spent all
[1:12:28] her money. This is when he was coming
[1:12:30] through. Amen. Going to heal Gyrus's
[1:12:33] daughter. And there was the woman with
[1:12:34] the blood issue said, "If I can touch
[1:12:35] the hem of his garment," and he says,
[1:12:37] "She had spent all her money. She just
[1:12:39] wasn't going down half-hazardly. She
[1:12:41] spent all of her money on doctors and
[1:12:43] none of them could help her." And she
[1:12:45] come believing sincerely, not just say
[1:12:47] somebody else done it. As far as we
[1:12:48] know, nobody else had ever done it. She
[1:12:51] started something,
[1:12:53] did she? This was new. Brother Gabe was
[1:12:55] preaching on this. She said, "I believe
[1:12:57] that man so much that if I could touch
[1:13:00] the board of his garment, I'd be made
[1:13:02] whole." She just wasn't saying that. She
[1:13:05] believed it. You can say lots of things,
[1:13:08] but is her action vindicated her faith.
[1:13:11] She was sincere in it. No doubt it cost
[1:13:14] her her membership in the church. It
[1:13:15] cost her a lot of things, but she was
[1:13:17] sincere. She was determined to do it.
[1:13:20] And her sincere touch on the border of
[1:13:22] his garment stopped him in the track.
[1:13:23] And he looked around. He said, "Who
[1:13:25] touched me?" Amen. My goodness. Could
[1:13:29] you imagine if she didn't persist?
[1:13:32] You know the as brother Gabe was
[1:13:34] preaching there was a throng all about
[1:13:36] him. Everybody was pressing. It wasn't
[1:13:39] an easy swipe by in the foyer here of
[1:13:42] the church and reach down and touch
[1:13:45] cuz the crowd thronged him. The
[1:13:47] multitudes thronged him. How? And
[1:13:49] listen, she had to get low enough to
[1:13:51] touch the hem of his garment. And
[1:13:52] brother Benham showed us how long those
[1:13:54] garments were and they swept up the dust
[1:13:55] from the ground. So she would have to
[1:13:57] get to ground level. And at ground
[1:13:59] level, amen, there was everybody else's
[1:14:01] feet and all the dust and and everything
[1:14:03] from a multitude thronging him. And she
[1:14:05] would have to weave her way in and out
[1:14:07] of She may have had to push and shove.
[1:14:10] Not good church order.
[1:14:13] Not good etiquette. She probably had to
[1:14:15] elbow her way in and scrap and fight.
[1:14:17] But she knew in her heart if I can touch
[1:14:19] the hem of his garment. And she believed
[1:14:21] it. She was sincere with it. And she
[1:14:23] pressed until
[1:14:26] Can you imagine? She got her finger
[1:14:28] stipped on halfway through. Oh
[1:14:31] and turned back. Right. Right. Got
[1:14:34] kicked under the chin with somebody's
[1:14:36] heel and quit.
[1:14:42] We read so many stories in the Bible.
[1:14:45] We don't imagine what it was actually
[1:14:46] like to get through a throng through
[1:14:49] people's feet down on the ground to get
[1:14:52] to the hem of his garment. But when she
[1:14:55] got all the way to her goal, she was
[1:14:57] healed. Amen.
[1:15:00] Brother Bam, now speaking of the uh
[1:15:03] three Hebrew men and the fiery furnaces,
[1:15:05] I know that sounds all right, but our
[1:15:07] God is able to deliver us. They had
[1:15:10] patience. They started walking up the
[1:15:12] ramp. One looked at the other one. It's
[1:15:14] all right. All right. Got patience. Went
[1:15:16] one step. God wasn't there. Two steps.
[1:15:19] He wasn't there. Three steps, four
[1:15:21] steps, five steps, just kept on going.
[1:15:23] Still, he wasn't there. And he stepped
[1:15:25] right off into the fire furnace. They
[1:15:27] had patience, but he was there. Yeah.
[1:15:30] They held on to their faith all the way
[1:15:33] to the finish line. They never gave up
[1:15:34] on it. And when they held on all the way
[1:15:36] to the finish line, he was there.
[1:15:40] I wonder how many times when we've
[1:15:42] persevered for something, I wonder how
[1:15:44] many times we quit just before we got
[1:15:45] it.
[1:15:47] It's a good thought. It's a good
[1:15:50] thought because he's promised it to
[1:15:54] us.
[1:15:56] Listen, I say don't ever stop.
[1:16:00] Let's never stop. Let's never stop
[1:16:04] believing for our loved ones. Let's
[1:16:06] never stop praying. Let's never stop
[1:16:08] interceding. Let's never stop. Amen.
[1:16:10] Don't just say, "It's been 10 years.
[1:16:12] It's been so many years. Or they're so
[1:16:14] far gone." Don't ever stop. Amen.
[1:16:17] Don't ever stop believing for your
[1:16:19] children.
[1:16:20] Don't forget, you know that brother Bam
[1:16:23] calls the or what what the woman, the
[1:16:25] Anchamima woman in Tennessee, she never
[1:16:27] gave up on her baby boy, though he had
[1:16:29] lived a sinful life, though he had
[1:16:31] caught a a a veneerial disease. He had a
[1:16:34] social disease and he was dying. He was
[1:16:36] laying in the bed dying and she wanted
[1:16:38] him saved. And she prayed and prayed
[1:16:39] until God brought a storm. Grounded
[1:16:42] Brother Benham's plane. Wouldn't allow
[1:16:43] him to get it fixed in time. Sent him on
[1:16:45] a stroll down the road. Amen. All the
[1:16:48] way to her house because she never gave
[1:16:50] up. And she prayed. How long did she
[1:16:52] pray? 1 hour, two hours. She prayed
[1:16:54] until.
[1:16:56] She pressed until. And that boy was
[1:16:58] saved. And that boy was healed. Amen.
[1:17:06] Listen, the devil wants us to quit
[1:17:12] and that's all he wants.
[1:17:14] Just wants us to quit.
[1:17:17] I said, "Let's not quit."
[1:17:20] Let's not quit believing for our
[1:17:22] families, believing for our
[1:17:24] marriages. You know, I've seen so many
[1:17:27] times where one or the other couple
[1:17:29] quits. I mean, they don't get divorced.
[1:17:32] They stay married because they're in the
[1:17:33] message. But one of them quit because it
[1:17:37] got too hard. I got tired of having my
[1:17:39] heart broken. I got tired of my husband
[1:17:43] or my wife not understanding me and not
[1:17:45] treating me right. And all of a sudden,
[1:17:47] they disconnect their heart. They shook
[1:17:49] off the switch. They quit. They stay
[1:17:53] married, but they've quit pressing
[1:17:57] towards one another. They quit. They
[1:17:59] quit pushing for harmony and unity and
[1:18:02] love and affection. And all of a sudden
[1:18:04] there's a disconnection. You got two
[1:18:05] people in the same house, but that's no
[1:18:07] marriage. Amen. Marriage is not a
[1:18:10] certificate. Yeah. It's two becoming
[1:18:12] one. Amen. Amen. I say if you're in that
[1:18:16] situation, don't stop. Amen. Don't quit.
[1:18:20] Zakius's wife never quit praying for
[1:18:22] Zakius. Amen. How long did she pray for
[1:18:25] Zakius? Until God looked up at the tree
[1:18:27] and said, "Zakius, come down. I'm going
[1:18:29] to your house." Amen. Her prayer, Amen,
[1:18:31] sent Zakius up a tree and sent Jesus
[1:18:34] under the tree.
[1:18:36] Why? Because she was praying for her
[1:18:38] husband who was a sinner and who was
[1:18:39] lost. Amen. I'm telling you, don't quit
[1:18:41] on your kids. You can say they're
[1:18:42] rebellious. They won't listen to
[1:18:43] anything I say. Don't stop trying to
[1:18:45] have a relationship with your children.
[1:18:47] Don't ever quit pressing. You remember
[1:18:49] when brother Ben when Billy Paul I mean
[1:18:51] Billy Paul tells his testimony when he
[1:18:53] went wayward and he started want to go
[1:18:55] his own way. He couldn't even live in
[1:18:56] brother Benham's house. He went to go
[1:18:58] live with his grandma
[1:19:00] because of the things he wanted to do
[1:19:01] and the things he was getting involved
[1:19:03] in. And when he was living with his
[1:19:06] grandma couldn't even be in brother
[1:19:08] Brenham's house. He was going wayward.
[1:19:11] Brother Brandham said asked him if he
[1:19:13] wanted to go fishing
[1:19:15] because brother Brenham never gave up on
[1:19:17] Billy Pole.
[1:19:19] And Billy Paul gives the testimony like
[1:19:20] this. He said they're out there fishing
[1:19:22] around a pond or something. I don't
[1:19:24] remember where. And they're fishing. And
[1:19:26] brother Ram kept stepping closer to
[1:19:27] Billy Paul. And every time Billy Paul
[1:19:30] Billy Paul would step further away cuz
[1:19:33] he knew what his dad was trying to do.
[1:19:34] Brother would go one step closer, he'd
[1:19:36] go further away. He said till they went
[1:19:38] all the way around the
[1:19:41] pond. Oh, praise God. Brother Benham
[1:19:43] never gave up on his boy. It didn't
[1:19:45] matter. He was weward. It didn't matter
[1:19:47] what it looked like. It didn't matter
[1:19:48] what it sounded like. That was his
[1:19:50] heritage. God gave it to him and he was
[1:19:52] going to keep trying. At least he
[1:19:53] couldn't force Billy Paul to do
[1:19:55] anything, but he could say, "Son, you
[1:19:56] want to go fishing?" Right? Don't give
[1:19:59] up on family. Don't give up on friends.
[1:20:02] Don't give up on loved ones. Never stop.
[1:20:04] The devil wants you to quit. Get
[1:20:06] discouraged. Think it'll never happen.
[1:20:07] They're too far gone. Oh, look, they've
[1:20:09] got this piercing now and they got these
[1:20:11] tattoos now. Look, they've in this kind
[1:20:12] of relationship. Don't give up. Don't
[1:20:16] stop believing. Who else will intercede
[1:20:18] for them if you won't intercede for
[1:20:19] them? Who else is going to stand in the
[1:20:21] gap? Who has a connection with Almighty
[1:20:23] God that can say, "God, that's the son
[1:20:25] you gave me. That's the daughter you
[1:20:27] gave me. Will you turn this situation
[1:20:29] around?" Amen. If you give up on your
[1:20:32] marriage, who will care more about your
[1:20:33] marriage than you do?
[1:20:36] If you give up on your husband, you give
[1:20:37] up on your wife. Listen, this is not
[1:20:39] time to quit. This is not time to have
[1:20:42] halfway marriages and halfway families
[1:20:44] and halfway this and that. Amen. The
[1:20:46] full word has come with the full life.
[1:20:48] This is time to press, friends.
[1:20:51] If you don't feel like you have the
[1:20:52] unity you need in your marriage, press
[1:20:54] for it. Amen. You say, "But my husband
[1:20:57] won't, but my wife won't. But don't
[1:21:00] worry about them." Amen. Amen. What do
[1:21:04] you mean, brother Chad?
[1:21:06] Listen, that woman who had a drunk
[1:21:09] husband,
[1:21:10] who was out drinking all night and
[1:21:12] abusive with his language and his
[1:21:14] attitude, listen, she didn't stop just
[1:21:16] because he was rotten, right? She kept
[1:21:18] believing for him and praying for him.
[1:21:20] Amen. And she maintained her sweetness
[1:21:22] and her honor and her respect to him.
[1:21:26] Some of us can't respect some of the
[1:21:28] people, some of some people maybe even
[1:21:30] in this own church, they can't respect
[1:21:32] their husbands because their husbands
[1:21:33] don't treat them right. Well, my she
[1:21:36] maintained her respect for her husband.
[1:21:39] I don't think any of your husbands are
[1:21:40] drunk
[1:21:42] at the bar, right?
[1:21:48] I mean, he may be a little he might be a
[1:21:50] knucklehead, a little insensitive, and
[1:21:52] have no idea what he's doing to hurt
[1:21:53] your feelings. That's probably
[1:21:57] true. I mean, you want to ask me how I
[1:21:59] know it's true. I won't tell you,
[1:22:02] but it might have been true for me a few
[1:22:04] times. Amen.
[1:22:06] But listen, if you pull away, how's it
[1:22:08] going to get any better? If you give up,
[1:22:10] if you quit, if you throw in the towel,
[1:22:12] if you say, "It's always going to be
[1:22:13] like this. Our family will always be
[1:22:15] like this. Our marriage will always be
[1:22:16] like this." Don't do that, friends. The
[1:22:18] devil wants you to quit. Don't quit. If
[1:22:20] God, you say, "God, that's my wife.
[1:22:22] That's my husband." And you want us to
[1:22:24] reflect. We're here to reflect you and
[1:22:27] your bride. And until we come into that
[1:22:29] reflection, I'm going to keep pressing
[1:22:30] forward. Amen. Don't give up on your
[1:22:33] brethren. Don't give up on your family.
[1:22:35] Don't give up on your children. Don't
[1:22:36] give up on your marriage.
[1:22:38] Don't give up on your church.
[1:22:41] Don't give up on the brother or sister
[1:22:43] next to you. Don't give up on your
[1:22:46] family or your loved ones. Don't Don't
[1:22:48] give up, friends. Don't give up on
[1:22:52] yourself. Don't say, "I've tried so many
[1:22:54] times and I
[1:22:56] failed."
[1:22:58] Well, I just can't be. It just can't
[1:23:00] work. I I've tried and I failed and
[1:23:03] tried and failed and I don't just I
[1:23:05] don't see how God can accept me or how I
[1:23:08] can be one of
[1:23:09] them. But for me, God already kind of
[1:23:11] answered that question because Peter
[1:23:13] asked uh how many times shall I forgive
[1:23:17] my brother if he offend me?
[1:23:21] Seven times.
[1:23:24] I said seven times 70 in a day. Yeah,
[1:23:27] that was the question. in one day,
[1:23:29] right?
[1:23:30] 490 times. So basically, he's saying not
[1:23:34] seven times, but seven times. He said,
[1:23:35] "How many times in a day?" Yeah, that
[1:23:37] was the question. So I'm supposed to
[1:23:39] forgive my brother if he offends me.
[1:23:42] Yeah. And if he asks for forgiveness,
[1:23:44] I'm supposed to forgive him 490 times in
[1:23:46] one day. Yeah. And you think God's going
[1:23:49] to ask me to do something he's not
[1:23:50] willing to do? Right.
[1:23:55] How many of you I'm not going to ask
[1:23:57] that question 490 times in a day? I said
[1:24:00] there's some leeway there for some
[1:24:02] mistakes.
[1:24:04] Amen. Don't ever quit, friends. It
[1:24:06] doesn't matter. Don't give up on
[1:24:08] yourself either. Cuz God hasn't given up
[1:24:10] on you. Yeah. Amen. There's many of us,
[1:24:14] we've given up on
[1:24:16] ourselves. We got discouraged and I
[1:24:19] failed and I failed one more time and
[1:24:21] and I failed again. Listen, don't look
[1:24:24] at your flesh. Look at the word. Look at
[1:24:27] the
[1:24:28] promise. When sister Georgia Bruce was
[1:24:32] in the private interview with Brother
[1:24:33] Brandham and she was struggling with
[1:24:35] this, you have the Holy Ghost. She said,
[1:24:36] "But brother Brandham, I make so many
[1:24:38] mistakes." You remember what Brother Bam
[1:24:40] said? He said, "Yeah, but that's what
[1:24:43] the blood of Jesus is for is for our
[1:24:45] mistakes. He's not looking at your
[1:24:47] mistakes. He's looking at the desire of
[1:24:49] your heart.
[1:24:53] If the devil can get you to quit on
[1:24:56] yourself, you're done. Yeah. He just
[1:24:59] wants you to quit.
[1:25:02] I say I'm not quitting. Amen. Because
[1:25:05] Philippians 1:3 says, "I thank my God
[1:25:08] upon every remembrance of you always in
[1:25:11] every prayer of mine for you all, making
[1:25:13] requests with joy, for your fellowship
[1:25:15] in the gospel from the first day to now,
[1:25:17] being confident of this very thing, that
[1:25:19] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:25:21] will perform it unto the day of Jesus
[1:25:24] Christ." Amen. Who started the work in
[1:25:26] you? Was it the Lord? Amen. No man can
[1:25:29] come to me unless the father draws him.
[1:25:31] Did he draw you? Amen. He who begun a
[1:25:33] good work in you will not cease till he
[1:25:35] finished the work.
[1:25:38] Amen. I want to leave you with this last
[1:25:39] quote from the
[1:25:41] prophet. He said in Feast of the
[1:25:43] Trumpets, "And so will it be upon the
[1:25:45] bride, and so is it on the bride. We
[1:25:47] unworthy creatures deserving of hell,
[1:25:49] but his grace holds us through it." Look
[1:25:52] at how many lost and blind. How many was
[1:25:55] sinners was there in the world the hour
[1:25:56] I got saved. God saved me for a purpose
[1:25:59] and I am determined by his will to do
[1:26:02] that purpose. I don't care what anything
[1:26:04] else goes. I want to do it.
[1:26:08] How many of you believed you were saved
[1:26:10] for a purpose?
[1:26:13] Let's be determined that he'll have that
[1:26:15] purpose. Not that you can do all the
[1:26:17] work, but that you can surrender to his
[1:26:19] work and just give yourself as a vessel
[1:26:21] that he can use. Don't quit. Don't quit
[1:26:25] because you failed. Certainly don't quit
[1:26:27] because somebody else failed, right?
[1:26:29] Don't quit.
[1:26:31] Do we get discouraged? Absolutely. We
[1:26:34] get discouraged. I've been
[1:26:36] there. But guess what? It doesn't change
[1:26:39] the promise.
[1:26:41] It doesn't change the word. The way you
[1:26:44] feel today changes nothing in the mind
[1:26:46] of God.
[1:26:48] Let's all stand together. Musicians, if
[1:26:50] you'll come. And brother Riley, if
[1:26:51] you'll
[1:26:53] come. Amen.
[1:26:56] I was so encouraged this weekend
[1:27:00] because the way God just orchestrated
[1:27:03] the weekend for me. I felt like brother
[1:27:05] Jason was ministering to needs that I
[1:27:06] had in my heart, but at the same time,
[1:27:09] God was also using the gift he had
[1:27:11] placed in me. So, it was such an odd
[1:27:13] unique thing. Here I am feeding and
[1:27:15] growing and and being mended and healed
[1:27:17] and giving out at the same time. I think
[1:27:20] we can all live that way. Amen. I think
[1:27:22] we can all be let God be healing and
[1:27:24] mending and working on us at the same
[1:27:26] time we're working for him and for
[1:27:27] others. Amen. Amen. I was I was so
[1:27:32] overwhelmed with the
[1:27:34] atmosphere. I I learned something. I We
[1:27:36] all know it's true, but I learned
[1:27:38] something while I was in these meetings
[1:27:40] this weekend. There was such an
[1:27:41] anticipation in the meetings and as it
[1:27:43] built uh people had gathered in. They
[1:27:45] had special meetings. It was brother uh
[1:27:48] the church there evening light
[1:27:49] fellowship. It was their 33rd church
[1:27:51] anniversary and and they had anticip
[1:27:54] they had anticipation coming into the
[1:27:55] meetings. The meetings were building and
[1:27:57] I woke up Sunday morning and Sunday
[1:27:59] morning God had dealt with me Saturday
[1:28:01] night and for days on the subject and I
[1:28:03] I was just reviewing my notes and the
[1:28:06] anointing was striking so strong I
[1:28:07] couldn't sit in my seat anymore. I got
[1:28:09] up and I was pacing in the hotel. I was
[1:28:11] pacing in the hotel and it was welling
[1:28:13] up inside of me and it was coming up
[1:28:14] into my throat so strong I didn't know
[1:28:17] what was going to happen next.
[1:28:20] And I
[1:28:21] realized this isn't me.
[1:28:25] This is the expectation of the people.
[1:28:28] And this is the gift responding to the
[1:28:30] people.
[1:28:33] All God needs me to do is stay out of
[1:28:35] the way.
[1:28:37] And it so encouraged me and I realized
[1:28:40] the devil's been trying to get me just
[1:28:42] to be too tired
[1:28:44] to get what's he trying to do? He's
[1:28:46] trying to get me to hold back because
[1:28:49] brother Lonnie taught me something years
[1:28:51] ago that amazed me when I first started
[1:28:53] preaching. Brother Lonnie said, "My
[1:28:55] vision, my my imagery." He said, "Every
[1:28:57] time I go to the pool pit is I always
[1:28:59] have this image in my mind that I I take
[1:29:02] the gift that's in me and I put it in
[1:29:03] the wheelbarrow and I just push it
[1:29:05] through the pull pit for God to use."
[1:29:09] You know how many times that imagery has
[1:29:10] helped me God and realize it's not me,
[1:29:13] friends? I can be having the worst day
[1:29:15] of my life. Amen. But there's a there's
[1:29:17] a gift inside here. And what the devil
[1:29:18] wants me to do is say time out. What the
[1:29:21] devil wants you to do is say time out.
[1:29:25] How many of you want me to quit?
[1:29:28] Oh man, I'm glad you said
[1:29:30] that. I should have been ma very careful
[1:29:33] before I said that out loud.
[1:29:36] But guess what? If I don't get the
[1:29:39] option to quit, neither do you.
[1:29:41] Amen. Amen. Why is it because you don't
[1:29:45] have an official title in the church?
[1:29:46] You can come and go as you please.
[1:29:49] Because you haven't been voted as deacon
[1:29:51] or trustee, you can float.
[1:29:55] Why is it the pastor has to be here
[1:29:56] every service? But I don't.
[1:30:00] These are good questions to ask. Did God
[1:30:03] place you here or not? Or did you place
[1:30:05] yourself? If you placed yourself, come
[1:30:06] and go, right? But if God placed you,
[1:30:09] then this is your place. Amen. If God
[1:30:12] connects you to these believers, you're
[1:30:14] connected. God wants that connection,
[1:30:16] that connection's for you and that
[1:30:17] connection's for others. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:19] What right do we have to unplug
[1:30:21] ourselves from where God plugged us in
[1:30:23] just because we want to? Yeah. Or we're
[1:30:26] tired. Or we got overwhelmed or we got
[1:30:30] our feelings hurt. Right. That's right.
[1:30:34] Yes.
[1:30:35] Listen, everybody's had their feelings
[1:30:37] hurt.
[1:30:39] Guess what? you when you grow up in a
[1:30:40] family, you hurt each other's feelings
[1:30:42] all the time, but you can't change your
[1:30:45] last name.
[1:30:49] Amen. I mean I mean I tried running away
[1:30:52] once when I was like 12. I got cold and
[1:30:55] I went back
[1:30:58] home. We've all felt that way. But
[1:31:01] listen, we belong together and God put
[1:31:03] us together. And he can move whoever he
[1:31:05] wants anywhere. But let God do that. We
[1:31:07] don't do that cuz our feelings are hurt.
[1:31:08] Don't do that cuz we right are too
[1:31:10] tired.
[1:31:12] Where God placed us, we're in this
[1:31:13] together, friends.
[1:31:15] I need you, you need me, and we all need
[1:31:17] one another. Amen. Man, the devil wants
[1:31:20] us just to quit. Just stop. When I'm in
[1:31:24] my hotel room, I'm going overtime. I'm
[1:31:26] sorry, but I haven't seen you guys for
[1:31:29] for a week, you know, a little over a
[1:31:31] week. It was welling up so strong and
[1:31:34] the atmosphere was so rich. And when I
[1:31:36] got to the pull pit, it was listen, it
[1:31:39] wasn't like preaching, friends. It was
[1:31:41] like flying.
[1:31:43] Praise God. It was like an out-of- body
[1:31:46] experience. And I realized, Brother
[1:31:48] Brandham said the congregation is 50% of
[1:31:50] the gift. I feel like down there they
[1:31:52] were about
[1:31:55] 95%. Then I thought, you know what? It
[1:31:59] doesn't have to be a special meeting
[1:32:01] only. Right.
[1:32:04] If we could all just focus on what God
[1:32:06] has called us to. If we could surrender
[1:32:09] ourselves in a greater way and not get
[1:32:11] entangled and embroiled in other things
[1:32:13] and get our eyes off of everything else
[1:32:15] and say, "I'm just following Christ."
[1:32:17] Amen. And the way he's called me to
[1:32:19] follow him. And if we could all do that
[1:32:22] and listen and realize what God's
[1:32:24] calling us to, move forward. What's he
[1:32:28] calling you? Move forward. But I want to
[1:32:30] rest. Listen, your rest is in him. Let's
[1:32:33] move forward. Amen. But it's become too
[1:32:35] much. Listen, it's always too much.
[1:32:39] Let's move forward in Christ. The only
[1:32:42] way we can lose friends is if we quit.
[1:32:46] Let's not quit.
[1:32:48] Amen. Let's bow our heads and
[1:32:51] pray. Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you so
[1:32:54] much.
[1:32:56] God, you knew what I needed this last
[1:32:59] weekend. And I'm so thankful. You've
[1:33:01] been so good to
[1:33:02] me. God, you fed my soul. You poured
[1:33:05] healing balm into my heart. I so
[1:33:09] appreciate it,
[1:33:10] Lord. I'm so thankful, God, that you're
[1:33:14] so
[1:33:15] mindful. You understand, Lord, like you
[1:33:18] did for Elijah under the juniper tree.
[1:33:22] You came and you fed him some special
[1:33:24] cakes.
[1:33:26] God, I feel like you fed me some special
[1:33:28] cakes this
[1:33:29] weekend. And God, it gave me energy and
[1:33:32] it gave me strength. And I just want to
[1:33:34] say, Lord, I'm
[1:33:35] sorry. I'm sorry for being tired. I'm
[1:33:38] sorry for being weak. I'm sorry, Lord,
[1:33:43] for wanting to pull
[1:33:45] back. But I pray, God, that you would
[1:33:48] just let me use this strength to move
[1:33:50] forward. That there would be no pulling
[1:33:52] back. There would just be a moving
[1:33:54] forward. There'd be a no checking out,
[1:33:56] Lord, but there would be a a driving for
[1:33:59] the goal. Lord, when you were here, Lord
[1:34:02] Jesus, you set your face like flint for
[1:34:05] Jerusalem because you knew that was your
[1:34:07] calling. That was your
[1:34:09] destiny. God, help us all to set our
[1:34:11] face like flint. And Lord, if there's
[1:34:14] anybody here that's been discouraged,
[1:34:16] Lord, I pray that you would encourage
[1:34:17] them now. Pour strength into them, Lord,
[1:34:20] that they might realize that
[1:34:22] discouragement is part of the race.
[1:34:25] Being weary is part of it, Lord. But you
[1:34:27] told us not to faint, Lord, to move
[1:34:29] forward because victory is just ahead,
[1:34:32] Lord. It may be around the next corner.
[1:34:34] It may be over the next hill. We have no
[1:34:36] idea. But we'll never know if we quit,
[1:34:39] Lord. We'll never know how far away
[1:34:41] victory was if we stop now. And God,
[1:34:44] you've called us not just to have a good
[1:34:46] home, good family, a Christian walk in
[1:34:48] life. You've called us all the way to a
[1:34:50] body change. You've called us to take
[1:34:53] what no other generation has taken.
[1:34:55] Lord, that our atoms are going to
[1:34:56] change. And Lord, I'm determined that
[1:34:58] you're going to have this vessel to use
[1:35:00] for that. Lord, that God, I'm determined
[1:35:03] that God, I can't do it on my own, but
[1:35:05] Lord, if I can just surrender to you,
[1:35:07] you can come and do it. And I'm
[1:35:09] determined to stay in the game. God,
[1:35:12] help us, Lord, to move forward and not
[1:35:14] stop, not quit, not push pause. But
[1:35:18] Lord, may we yield ourselves to you
[1:35:19] every day and surrender to the calling
[1:35:21] with which you've called us day by day.
[1:35:24] We love you, Lord. We ask for your help
[1:35:26] over these things, Lord, that you would
[1:35:29] get glory in it all and that we would be
[1:35:31] vessels that you could work through.
[1:35:33] Bless us as an assembly and help us,
[1:35:35] Lord, to draw up closer together, to
[1:35:38] encourage one another, to strive, Lord,
[1:35:41] to be all that you've called us to be.
[1:35:44] We love you, Father, and we ask your
[1:35:45] blessings in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:35:50] Amen. God bless you, brother Riley.
[1:35:57] the shiny things. Let me look the other
[1:36:05] way. When the riches of this world try
[1:36:10] to hunt me down, draw me closer to you
[1:36:16] day by day.
[1:36:19] When I'm faced with something I don't
[1:36:25] understand, let me hold to
[1:36:28] your
[1:36:30] unchanging hand. I don't want to be
[1:36:34] caught up in anything Lord but
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:43] you Lord make me
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:50] desperate lest I should
[1:36:57] perish. Help me to
[1:37:01] pray. Feed on your word both night and
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:10] day. Don't
[1:37:12] let
[1:37:18] complacenc for the day is nearing an
[1:37:23] end.
[1:37:26] Let me hunger and thirst for
[1:37:31] you in
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:38] desperation. Give me wisdom, Lord, as I
[1:37:43] run this
[1:37:45] race. Discern my heart when I kneel to
[1:37:51] pray. I desire to do
[1:37:56] your perfect
[1:37:58] will. No
[1:38:02] impersonation. I want to be real. I'm
[1:38:07] expecting, Lord, and it won't be
[1:38:12] long. I must give birth to this promised
[1:38:18] son. It'll be great, Lord.
[1:38:23] For the time is soon to
[1:38:30] come. Lord, make me
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:37] desperate lest I should
[1:38:44] perish. Help me to pray.
[1:38:49] Feed on your word both night and
[1:38:57] day. Don't
[1:38:59] let
[1:39:02] complenc set
[1:39:05] in for the
[1:39:08] days nearing an end.
[1:39:13] Let me hunger enter and thirst for
[1:39:18] you in
[1:39:25] desperation. Amen. Before you go, I just
[1:39:28] want to think about those three Hebrew
[1:39:30] men that were going into the fiery
[1:39:33] furnace. They already made the
[1:39:35] declaration, "Our God is more than able,
[1:39:37] but even if he doesn't, he's able to
[1:39:39] deliver us, but even if he doesn't,"
[1:39:41] they had no guarantee. They believed he
[1:39:43] would, but no guarantee that he
[1:39:46] would. They got one step closer. He says
[1:39:50] God wasn't there. Two steps, God wasn't
[1:39:53] there. Three
[1:39:55] steps. What if they weren't determined
[1:39:57] to go all the
[1:39:58] way? What if they assumed, "Oh, I got an
[1:40:02] assumption here. God will deliver us
[1:40:03] when we get near the fire. God will not
[1:40:05] He'll certainly not let us go in that
[1:40:07] fire." And what if they had pulled the
[1:40:09] eject button somewhere along the way
[1:40:11] when they felt the flames. Amen. When
[1:40:13] the guards started to suffer, they they
[1:40:14] aborted. Never mind. And I thought he
[1:40:17] would save me, but he
[1:40:19] didn't. They would have never known what
[1:40:21] a miraculous deliverance lay just
[1:40:23] ahead. Just that last the worst step,
[1:40:27] the worst condition, the impossible.
[1:40:30] When nothing can save us, when there's
[1:40:32] no turning back, when there's no hope,
[1:40:34] when all hope is gone, that's where he
[1:40:37] was. What if they didn't take the last
[1:40:40] step? They would have never come in
[1:40:42] contact with a living, breathing son of
[1:40:44] God in their midst to fan away the
[1:40:46] flames. They would have missed a
[1:40:48] miracle. They would have missed the
[1:40:49] sign. They would have missed the
[1:40:50] deliverance. They would have missed the
[1:40:51] turning of Nebuchadnezzar's heart. They
[1:40:53] would have missed the declaration that
[1:40:54] went all over the world that this is the
[1:40:56] true God. Amen.
[1:40:59] What happened when they were willing to
[1:41:01] go all the way?
[1:41:03] There's story after story after story in
[1:41:06] the Bible. Listen, you can't determine
[1:41:08] after you get started to go all the way.
[1:41:10] You've got to determine before you begin
[1:41:12] to go all the way. If it gets bad, if it
[1:41:15] goes from bad to worse, if it gets
[1:41:16] impossible, if it gets where there's no
[1:41:18] more hope, this is a hopeless situation.
[1:41:20] All hope is gone. Hey, you already
[1:41:23] determined I'm going all the way. And
[1:41:25] many times God lets it get the darkest
[1:41:27] and the worst and impossible to show his
[1:41:30] glory. Many times deliverance comes past
[1:41:34] where we thought deliverance would come.
[1:41:40] What if that widow decided not to knock
[1:41:42] the next day? I've knocked
[1:41:45] enough. I've tried for 20 days, for 15
[1:41:49] days. How many days I've went knocking
[1:41:51] on the door asking for deliverance? She
[1:41:53] didn't know it was that time
[1:42:00] that he was going to answer.
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:04] How many times have we stopped just
[1:42:06] before? I don't know. But I'm determined
[1:42:09] not to stop again.
[1:42:12] Whatever it takes. Amen. Wherever he
[1:42:15] takes me, whatever he wants to do,
[1:42:16] wherever he wants to manifest, I want to
[1:42:18] be determined that he's going to have
[1:42:19] his way and I'm going to follow him.
[1:42:23] Hey, Peter was determined. I'm going all
[1:42:26] the way. But he didn't. He bailed out.
[1:42:28] He hit the eject button when it got too
[1:42:31] scary. I'll go to prison. I'll go to
[1:42:33] death. But when prison me came, he
[1:42:37] bailed. He had to go die out to himself
[1:42:40] and be born again by the spirit of God.
[1:42:41] But with the spirit of God, he was able
[1:42:43] to go all the way. Amen. All the way to
[1:42:47] crucifixion. all the way to being hung
[1:42:50] upside down on a cross and giving his
[1:42:52] life. So, I want that same spirit to be
[1:42:55] in me to help me go all the way. And I
[1:42:58] want to yield to that spirit. I don't
[1:43:00] want to pull the eject button anymore. I
[1:43:02] know I'm not the only one who's pulled
[1:43:04] the eject button
[1:43:06] and tried to save
[1:43:07] myself. No more eject
[1:43:10] buttons. No more abort. Let's just go
[1:43:13] all the way and let God have his way.
[1:43:15] and never stop and never
[1:43:18] quit. What we might just find is we
[1:43:21] might find the son of
[1:43:22] God, one like unto the son of God right
[1:43:26] in our midst, right in our camp, fanning
[1:43:28] the flaves away.
[1:43:30] Praise God. Never stop, friends. Amen.
[1:43:34] Let's sing again, Riley. God bless you
[1:43:36] all. It's good to be home. It's good to
[1:43:40] see you all again. Amen.
[1:43:44] me the shiny thing. Let me look the
[1:43:50] other the
[1:43:53] way. When the riches of this world try
[1:43:58] and hunt me down, draw me closer to you
[1:44:04] day by day.
[1:44:08] When I'm faced with
[1:44:10] something I don't
[1:44:13] understand, help me hold to
[1:44:17] your
[1:44:18] unchanging hand. I don't want to be
[1:44:23] caught up in anything Lord but
[1:44:31] you Lord make me
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:39] desperate lest I should
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:45] perish. Help me to
[1:44:49] pray. Feed on your work both night and
[1:44:58] day. Don't let
[1:45:03] complacency set
[1:45:06] in for the day is nearing ahead.
[1:45:14] We hunger and thirst for
[1:45:19] you in
[1:45:26] desperation. Give me wisdom, Lord, as I
[1:45:31] run this
[1:45:33] race. Discern my heart. When I yield to
[1:45:39] pray, I desire to do your perfect
[1:45:46] will. No
[1:45:50] impersonations. I want to be real. I'm
[1:45:54] expecting, Lord, and it won't be
[1:45:59] long. I must give birth to this promised
[1:46:05] son.
[1:46:07] We be ready
[1:46:09] Lord for the time is soon to
[1:46:17] come. Lord make me
[1:46:24] desperate lest I should
[1:46:31] bear. Help me to
[1:46:35] pray. Fit on your word both night and
[1:46:44] day. Don't let
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:56] complacencing an end.
[1:47:00] Let me conquer and thirst for
[1:47:05] you in desperation.
[1:47:08] [Music]
