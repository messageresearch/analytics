[0:00] in sincerity with a sincere heart
[0:03] wanting to actually do something for God
[0:06] but not doing it according to the word.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; That's the greatest temptation you and I
[0:11] are going to face.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; What's the solution to the temptation?
[0:16] Paul told us, I die daily.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; I die to my wants. I die to my dreams. I
[0:23] died to my ambitions. I died to my
[0:25] pride. I die to all of that and
[0:27] surrender to his word. Amen.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; And secondly, I want to walk in a
[0:31] relationship with him to where he can
[0:33] correct me.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; To where he can come like he did to
[0:38] David and said, "David, you got the
[0:39] right idea in bringing the ark back. You
[0:41] got the right motive, but you're doing
[0:43] it wrong."
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[0:45] &gt;&gt; And David would say, "Oh, God."
[0:49] He doesn't go back to everybody and
[0:50] says, "You know, I think um uh I had
[0:54] another idea."
[0:56] trying to keep his pride and trying to
[0:58] look good. No, I believe David went back
[1:01] and says, "Guys, I got it all wrong.
[1:03] This is where we failed.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; We didn't keep the word." Amen. We had
[1:07] the right desire. We had sincerity. We
[1:09] We wanted to worship God. We wanted his
[1:11] presence among us, but we we failed to
[1:12] keep the word. OH, LET'S COME BACK TO
[1:14] the word. And when they come back to the
[1:16] word, look at the revival. Look at the
[1:17] jubilee. Look at the dancing. Look at
[1:19] the sing. LOOK AT THE SHOUTING. AS THE
[1:21] ARK CAME, THE WORD CAME ON THE SHOULDERS
[1:24] OF THE LEVITES, MARCHING BACK INTO
[1:25] JERUSALEM, BRINGING THE WORD AND THE
[1:27] PRESENCE OF GOD BACK INTO THEIR MIDST.
[1:29] AND DAVID DANCED BEFORE THE LORD UNTIL
[1:31] HIS WIFE CALLED HIM A FOOL.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; HE WAS SO EXCITED. WHAT WAS EXCITING
[1:37] DAVID? DAVID WAS SO THRILLED. AMEN.
[1:39] BECAUSE GOD HAD CORRECTED HIM AND GOD
[1:42] HAD TOLD HIM, "WHAT YOU DESIRE IS RIGHT,
[1:44] BUT YOU GOT TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY." AND
[1:46] NOW DAVID KNEW THE RIGHT WAY. AND DAVID
[1:48] COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HIS JOY BECAUSE
[1:50] IT'S GOING TO WORK THIS TIME. IT'S GOING
[1:52] TO WORK THIS TIME. THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:54] IS COMING BACK AMONG US BECAUSE WE'RE
[1:56] DOING IT ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; EVERY FEW STEPS SLAY OXEN. EVERY FEW
[2:01] STEPS SLAY. WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
[2:03] REJOICING. REJOICING. REJOICING BECAUSE
[2:06] THE word's coming back.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; TILL HE DANCED BEFORE THE LORD WITH ALL
[2:12] HIS MIGHT AND DISROED HIS OUTER
[2:13] GARMENTS. TILL HIS WIFE BEGAN TO MOCK
[2:15] HIM, WHICH WAS SAUL'S DAUGHTER.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; HAD THE SAME PROBLEM HER DAD DID, PRIDE.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; And she said, "IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT,
[2:23] COME WATCH ME TOMORROW."
[2:27] &gt;&gt; LIKE, THAT'S NOT PRIDE, FRIENDS. THAT'S
[2:28] NOT ARROGANCE. THAT'S A MAN WHO KNOWS
[2:30] THAT WORD IS GOING TO COME BACK BECAUSE
[2:33] GOD GAVE ME THE WORD AND THAT WORD CAN'T
[2:35] FAIL. AND I KNOW EXACTLY NOW HOW TO
[2:37] ACCOMPLISH WHAT'S IN MY HEART.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; I KNOW HOW TO WORSHIP HIM. I KNOW WHAT
[2:41] HE WANTS. AMEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE ABEL
[2:43] WAITING TO WORSHIP GOD? AMEN. AT THE
[2:45] GATE OF OF EDEN, NOT KNOWING WHAT GOD
[2:47] WANTS AND HOW TO WORSHIP HIM AND HOW TO
[2:49] PLEASE HIM. CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS JOY WHEN
[2:52] HE GOT THE REVELATION? GOD WANTS BLOOD.
[2:54] ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT DAWNED ON HIM. WHAT
[2:56] DID HE DO WHEN MY PARENTS FELL? WHAT WAS
[2:58] GOING ON THERE? WHY AM I IN this
[3:00] condition? WHY ARE WE OUTSIDE OF THE
[3:02] GARDEN? ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE REALIZED HE
[3:04] WANTS BLOOD.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE HIS REJOICING AS HE WENT
[3:08] SKIPPING AND JUMPING AND RUNNING TO GO
[3:09] FIND A LAMB? BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHAT
[3:12] WILL WORK. I KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS. I KNOW
[3:14] HOW TO PLEASE THE LORD. IT WILL WORK
[3:17] &gt;&gt; because it's according to the word.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; WE TRY TO SAVE PEOPLE. WE TRY TO DO
[3:22] GREAT WORKS FOR GOD. WE TRY CAMPAIGNS.
[3:24] WE TRY ALL OF THIS AND IT WON'T WORK IF
[3:26] IT'S NOT DONE ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; The word IS THE WAY. IT'S BEEN THE WAY
[3:32] FROM THE BEGINNING. WE'VE GOT TO COME
[3:34] BACK TO THE WORD. AND PRAISE GOD, GOD
[3:37] HAS SENT BACK HIS WORD IN THIS DAY BY A
[3:39] VINDICATED PROPHET TO BRING US THE FULL
[3:42] TEACHING OF THE FATHERS OF FAITH.
