[16:11] anyway
[16:13] you'll i' sort of kept it a secret that
[16:15] I was going to be here until I think
[16:17] brother Chad mentioned it at the
[16:18] communion service so nobody else would
[16:20] know and I was
[16:21] thankful and then uh brother Mike said
[16:25] to me sneakily we know who's ministering
[16:27] next Sunday
[16:30] okay that's fine I just want to say
[16:32] thank you um to brother Chad as well and
[16:35] brother Chad includes you all that

[16:40] and uh we just pray that brother Chad
[16:41] has a time of rest it's um something
[16:45] that he you need now and again and for
[16:48] me I don't kind of have anybody else to
[16:50] sign a stand in for me so I don't get
[16:53] that break but I've got it now but I
[16:56] haven't got it now
[16:59] but it's all good the Lord's good just
[17:02] want to thank you as well from brother
[17:03] Mike sister Mar and sister Pon theard
[17:04] for your prayers and support you know
[17:06] during the time that we had that was a
[17:07] very trying time and they wanted to
[17:10] mention that I said Thank you personally
[17:12] and we're just so they were so touched
[17:14] as well I was preaching a couple of
[17:16] weeks ago on healing and healing comes
[17:19] in many different ways music love and
[17:21] all these things and and how you know I
[17:23] know for sister Mar and the cards that
[17:26] she's had on the mantle piece from from
[17:28] you guys and the love and the
[17:30] appreciation it really is something that
[17:32] helps us and helps that healing process
[17:35] the Lord's good you know we're all just
[17:38] kind of doing our bit you know for the
[17:40] Lord and um
[17:43] I'm I'm just a farm boy you know and I
[17:47] just wanted to farm and the Lord kind of
[17:51] yeah called me and it's not really what
[17:55] I chose to do in life and um um but it's
[17:59] what the Lord's got for me and if the
[18:01] Lord would ask us to do it again we'd do
[18:03] it again each one of us whatever
[18:05] sacrifice we have to make um I've just
[18:08] got a real simple thought this morning
[18:10] and I'm just praying that the
[18:12] Lord just gives it you know um I've got
[18:16] I'm I'm I'm not the cleverest
[18:18] fell I'm very simple and so I've got to
[18:21] write everything down CU I forget if you
[18:24] asked me I'm being serious if you asked
[18:26] me what I had for dinner yesterday I've
[18:27] got a really sit down and think about it
[18:29] and I've forgotten now there was
[18:30] potatoes there and there was some else
[18:33] steak that's right I'm I'm terrible
[18:35] memory I just can't help it so I've got
[18:38] to write it all down and you
[18:41] know the Lord took a few bloves and a
[18:44] few fishes and he fed a
[18:46] multitude and the Lord can take a few
[18:49] words this morning and my thoughts are
[18:52] everywhere Brother Kyle bless his heart
[18:54] where is he's up there somewhere he he
[18:56] came to there where is he there he is
[18:58] smiling face he came to put his arms
[19:00] around me and I said oh brother kle do
[19:03] you know I'm I'm being honest with you
[19:05] this the first time that I've ever had
[19:06] my thoughts everywhere you know I don't
[19:10] usually it just kind of all comes but
[19:12] the lord gave me this word that 3 weeks
[19:14] ago whatever it was and I was just
[19:16] really stressed out about what Lord what
[19:18] would you want but I was kind of driving
[19:20] this semi and I was busy that day and I
[19:23] was listening to the service and then
[19:24] brother Chad actually I was listening to
[19:26] while I was working and
[19:28] then the next morning nothing and I was
[19:30] really stressed out so I couldn't listen
[19:31] anymore I turned it off and because I'm
[19:34] just me I have to um prepare usually on
[19:39] Sunday mornings so I'm up at 5:00 and go
[19:42] and prepare so that's my Sunday morning
[19:44] because usually I've got to be work and
[19:46] I'm just so busy on Saturday so 5:00 in
[19:49] the morning I just sort of press play on
[19:50] the sermon that I would half finished
[19:53] and brother Chad I just cut sign there
[19:55] was just something he said I listened to
[19:56] 5 Seconds of what he said he was
[19:58] preaching on the twin within and he just
[20:01] spoke about the tree of the knowledge of
[20:02] Good and Evil and suddenly you just kind
[20:05] of know it brother Kyle you said it you
[20:07] just kind and that's what the thought
[20:09] was and the thought became it started
[20:12] with a question a question where did the
[20:15] tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[20:17] come from where's where's it come from
[20:19] you know many times I find um I find
[20:23] many answers many truth Revelation comes
[20:26] for me many times through questions
[20:28] so we have a question about something
[20:30] and that leads the thought to finding
[20:33] the
[20:34] truth so you know when I was a when I
[20:38] was a kid I'm still trying to calm down
[20:41] by the
[20:42] way when I was a kid we used to one
[20:45] thing you know I grew up pretty poor but
[20:47] um one thing that my dad is kind of a
[20:50] traveler um and we kind of traveled a
[20:53] lot as children that's the one thing
[20:54] that we did do we were poor but we
[20:56] traveled and you fly on the plane I'd
[20:58] love sitting there looking out the
[20:59] window and they back then there were the
[21:01] big old planes the big
[21:03] old big old things and massive wings and
[21:07] you know the be the big and you'd get in
[21:08] the big flaps you'd watch them flicking
[21:10] up and down do you remember that and
[21:12] you'd see them flicking up and you'd see
[21:13] all the Hydraulics and stuff and I was
[21:15] fascinated and well we came over on I
[21:17] mean you guys it's probably old for you
[21:19] guys but we came over one of these new
[21:20] sort of Dreamliner
[21:22] things and then I noticed that you got
[21:27] three huge Flags
[21:29] and there's one absolutely it's about 2
[21:31] and 1/2t
[21:33] long and the whole airplane the whole
[21:36] time do were only using that little
[21:38] flap and you just it would move like I
[21:41] was sat there watching it it move like
[21:43] an inch and the whole thing would start
[21:47] moving and then and then we came into
[21:49] some
[21:51] turbulence and and that little they
[21:53] didn't start using the big ones no no no
[21:55] you like back 15 20 years ago you know
[21:58] when the message was we were all a
[22:00] little bit Pentecostal or whatever and
[22:02] you know how it is you you get the big
[22:04] guns in to do everything you'd always
[22:06] have the big people to come and sort
[22:07] things out and I know in Europe like
[22:09] you'd have the big preacher come around
[22:10] and sort all the wall small ones out and
[22:13] but this airlane it was just like this
[22:15] little flap M and the turbulence came
[22:18] and the plan started rocking around and
[22:20] that little flap just started flicking
[22:21] his finger and and he sorted the whole
[22:24] thing out it's awesome so I thought if
[22:25] the Lord can do that if if if that works
[22:27] in in natural then the Lord can just
[22:29] take a small little word and just just
[22:32] gently flick Us in the right direction
[22:33] and steer us the Lord is good you know
[22:36] these wings of the old Eagle it'll carry
[22:37] us home and if if the Lord just flicks
[22:40] that little wing and it just we'll be
[22:42] fine all is good so this question came
[22:46] where did the tree of life come
[22:48] from so hopefully I've calmed down so if
[22:51] we can open our Bibles please to Genesis
[22:54] 1:1 and we can stand for this one yes
[22:56] indeed
[22:59] hope you can understand me I haven't uh
[23:03] gone all American
[23:05] yet we were about I was this is going to
[23:07] embarrass Josh but we're about 15
[23:09] minutes from
[23:10] home I said so Josh are you going to go
[23:14] all American he said no Dad I'm from
[23:17] Yorkshire I'm I'm I'm stay in Yorkshire
[23:20] last night he came back from where were
[23:22] they Columbus they'd been out with Riley
[23:25] and the boys Sam and he telling me so I
[23:28] so Josh what' you get
[23:30] me I got a t-shirt and some
[23:33] jeans I said you mean a
[23:36] t-shirt said no I got a
[23:39] t-shirt anyway it's all good Lord's
[23:43] good it's a little bit Babble on in it
[23:46] but all is well so I'd like to start if
[23:48] we can please let's just to read Genesis
[23:52] 1:1 but before we do like even just just
[23:54] to pray and then and then we'll read we
[23:57] pray before Lord Jesus we eat a meal
[23:59] Lord and we pray now before we're fed of
[24:01] your word Lord Jesus who are we to Stand
[24:04] Here Lord who are we lord who am I Lord
[24:07] the life I've lived Lord I loved you
[24:09] always Lord but I didn't live right Lord
[24:11] and Lord now you changed me you called
[24:13] me to this place Lord and I'm standing
[24:15] here Lord I'm not comfortable Lord Lord
[24:17] Jesus come down and just speak to us we
[24:19] pray bless my brother in Lord Jesus they
[24:21] here Lord Jesus please deliver the
[24:23] thought like you gave it to me Lord just
[24:25] encourage me I pray just encourage the
[24:27] people Lord Jesus bless your word now
[24:29] and open your words to us we pray we
[24:30] love you Lord amen so Genesis
[24:34] 1:1 says in the beginning God created
[24:37] the Heaven and the Earth notice it says
[24:41] the heaven one Heaven and the Earth so
[24:44] you may be seated and you sit down we
[24:46] pray your blessing on the reading of the
[24:47] word so our title this morning for the
[24:50] thought for the sermon I don't claim to
[24:53] be a I don't claim to be a preacher and
[24:55] I don't know if brother Michael and
[24:56] sister Maran and so on I've ever
[24:58] actually noticed but I always start by
[25:00] saying my thought for this evening or
[25:03] the thought for this morning I don't
[25:05] like to say the title of the sermon
[25:07] because I'm honestly I'm not very I'm
[25:08] not a preacher but the thought is seed
[25:13] sewn trees grown and fruits shown
[25:17] brother Ben in here somewhere there he
[25:19] is and brother Ben is the the master of
[25:23] the
[25:23] subtitles so I'm going to give a
[25:25] subtitle roots and
[25:28] fruits I was kind of between it's pretty
[25:31] good the Lord is good oh yeah so
[25:36] uh we've just read Genesis
[25:39] 1:1 and it's in the beginning brother
[25:41] Franco I'm going to use this already if
[25:43] it's
[25:44] possible I'm uh I've got a whiteboard at
[25:47] home but I'm going to try this one again
[25:49] so we're going to I'd like to just do a
[25:50] little timeline here and here right
[25:54] time uh and time is going that way
[25:59] okay and it's very difficult to use this
[26:01] time's going that way so it's a timeline
[26:03] in theory and so so here we have here we
[26:06] have like a line of time and we're going
[26:09] to say zero zero here zero and this is
[26:13] really bad forgive me and this is now so
[26:16] this is now when we say zero I was
[26:18] laying in bed this morning and your
[26:20] thoughts start turning and I just
[26:22] thought well actually time when did time
[26:24] actually begin this is not total to side
[26:28] subject when did time begin well it says
[26:30] in the beginning God created the heavens
[26:32] and the Earth well that must have been
[26:34] time or was it when God said um when the
[26:37] evening and the morning was the first
[26:39] day well that's like one day isn't
[26:41] that's
[26:41] time but if Adam and Adam which would be
[26:45] Eve but Adam and Adam his other half
[26:47] were actually living in the Garden of
[26:48] Eden in the morning in morning in the
[26:50] first day we don't know how long it went
[26:52] on but if there was a month if there was
[26:54] a year if there was two years of morning
[26:55] and first morning and evening was the
[26:58] day were they was the
[27:01] time well there was morning and there
[27:04] those was Day morning and evening but
[27:06] actually if there's no death then they
[27:09] were still in
[27:10] eternity if you know what I'm saying so
[27:13] this this time this zero that I've
[27:15] written here it's not something I can
[27:18] answer but I like to ask questions I
[27:20] always like to ask questions so where is
[27:22] this where does time
[27:24] begin well the reason I'm saying this is
[27:27] that it's like there's a there's a
[27:28] blending of time there's a blending of
[27:31] time going from eternity into time
[27:34] because although the evening the morning
[27:35] was the first day if you're not going to
[27:37] die then it doesn't matter how many days
[27:38] there is If the fall hadn't have
[27:39] happened for example we wouldn't be here
[27:41] we know that if the fall hadn't have
[27:42] happened then we would be on the 65
[27:44] million and 31st morning and evening was
[27:46] the first was the whatever day see what
[27:49] I mean well now the reason I'm saying
[27:51] this the reason I'm bringing this little
[27:52] point is just just as a thought for you
[27:53] guys to think about later on it's like
[27:55] now in this church age where we are
[27:57] specific specifically now time is kind
[27:59] of blending again so at the beginning we
[28:02] get this kind of blending in that's it's
[28:04] it's kind of unsure where it started and
[28:07] we I would personally say well I don't
[28:09] know I just don't know where it started
[28:11] there's a blending but now we we're in
[28:13] Lea but we're not in Lea we're in the
[28:16] seventh Church age but we're in the
[28:17] bride age we are through the
[28:21] resurrection of Jesus Christ in our
[28:23] bodies we are now resurrected but we're
[28:25] dead we're dead yet we live yeah so
[28:27] there's this kind of blending that goes
[28:29] on now also and it's a nice blending so
[28:33] I'm going to put here just here and
[28:34] brother Franco explained to me I can
[28:35] move this somehow how do you do that
[28:36] brother
[28:38] Franco swi oh the screen gotcha yep yep
[28:41] and I've just said gotcha
[28:43] sorry sorry Josh so here I'm going to
[28:45] put here I'm going to put an earth and
[28:48] I'd like to draw an America there and a
[28:50] Europe
[28:51] there okay and I'm going to put over
[28:53] here I'm going to put the
[28:55] Moon and the Sun
[28:58] so yeah and we could even put Adam and
[28:59] Eve down here as well Adam and Eve which
[29:01] is this mate this is hard to do I'm
[29:04] drawing it looking up there but I'm it's
[29:05] all good cool so that's where we are now
[29:10] so we've read in the scriptures in the
[29:13] beginning God created heavens and earth
[29:16] and now here's another one for you this
[29:18] is the beginning but it's not the
[29:21] beginning see Genesis 1:1 is the
[29:23] beginning of
[29:25] creation okay so if we to go to the
[29:28] beginning am we've got to go to John 1:1
[29:31] so let's turn to John 1:1
[29:36] amen we're not going to get into that
[29:38] one we might do actually we'll see John
[29:41] one this is actually the beginning of
[29:45] the beginning this is Genesis 1 is the
[29:48] beginning of creation it's not the
[29:50] beginning so we're on John John 1 and
[29:52] we're going to read 1 to
[29:54] 3 so now he says in the beginning
[29:58] was the word yes and the Word was with
[30:01] God and the Word was God the same was in
[30:04] the beginning with God all things now
[30:07] listen this is the why we say it's not
[30:10] the beginning all things were made by
[30:12] him without him was not anything made
[30:13] that was made listen All Things the
[30:15] Bible teaches us that all things were
[30:16] created through the Lord Jesus Christ so
[30:18] what it says in Genesis one in the
[30:20] beginning God created heavens and the
[30:21] Earth as soon as it said he created that
[30:23] means that that is not the beginning so
[30:25] we got to go to John 1 we what happened
[30:27] this is now the question you see where
[30:29] did the tree where did the tree of norig
[30:31] and good and evil came from this is a
[30:33] question that came so now we're going to
[30:35] swipe the um swipe the board and I'm
[30:39] going to pretend that this is
[30:41] like uh do you have gazillions
[30:46] here oh yeah you've got
[30:49] everything
[30:51] 60 gazillion I don't know how to spell
[30:53] that
[30:54] gazillion years okay and it's back this
[30:58] way okay cuz we don't know I'm not
[31:00] trying to be clever I don't know but now
[31:02] so so now I'm and I like I love this
[31:05] kind of infolding um the idea of listen
[31:09] and this is Simon now this is not um you
[31:13] know not word I I love the I love this
[31:15] thought in the beginning this is Simon
[31:17] now this is not this Simon yeah in the
[31:19] beginning we have this kind
[31:22] of
[31:23] infolding power which is God the word so
[31:27] and and in there is all these attributes
[31:29] that's got to come out but in there we
[31:31] have kind of the pillar of fire the
[31:33] cloud although it's not manifested yet
[31:35] it's still in there everything is in
[31:38] there so and so I like to draw I draw
[31:40] these little arrows and I always imagine
[31:42] the kind of the the Moses this is Simon
[31:44] I always imagine Moses with the with a
[31:46] burning bush that the Burning Bush was
[31:48] kind of it wasn't just a normal fire it
[31:50] was a fire that was kind of infolding on
[31:52] itself all the time like
[31:55] a and it's got just power power like raw
[31:58] power and that's how I personally like
[32:00] to think that in the beginning this is
[32:02] how it was there was a power there so
[32:06] it's not just kind of in the beginning
[32:07] was the word and the sign com sign a a
[32:09] Bible off way off in the distance no no
[32:11] no no because this this this book this
[32:13] this word now this was also in that
[32:17] thing in the infolding power but this is
[32:19] a written word this is a written words
[32:21] this is for us to read and uh we're
[32:23] thankful for that
[32:25] now everything that is in this written
[32:27] word that we have here was in the
[32:30] beginning so in the beginning was the
[32:32] word including this although not
[32:36] manifested yet and even in the
[32:38] scriptures as we read through the
[32:39] scriptures within the scriptures there
[32:41] is everything that God has ever happen
[32:43] everything that's ever happened is in
[32:45] here good and bad everything that's ever
[32:47] happened everything that's happening now
[32:49] and everything that ever will happen
[32:51] it's all it's all in this word it's
[32:54] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[32:56] and forever amen amen see
[33:00] so it's about it's not about a book
[33:02] being back there then it's about the
[33:03] word being back there and you know
[33:05] brother Chad brought out I think a
[33:06] couple of weeks ago I listened to a
[33:07] sermon I think I was on the plane or
[33:08] whatever and he's talking about the the
[33:10] God God uh what did he say he said the
[33:13] spirit God in Christ you remember he
[33:15] wrote it on the board I think it's all
[33:16] one it's all the word it's all it's
[33:18] infolding it's all there although it's
[33:20] not been manifested yet okay so now
[33:22] before anything has been um manifested
[33:26] God is now alone with his
[33:29] thoughts now God's thoughts are as real
[33:33] as we're standing here so it's not just
[33:36] some kind of thought bubble it is
[33:39] reality the thought of go if I build
[33:42] something then I think it out first if
[33:43] you like brother John I'll think it out
[33:45] first and I'll build the whole thing in
[33:46] my head and then I'll build it and but
[33:49] it's not a reality until it's done but
[33:51] with God it's it's a question when when
[33:53] was the blood of the lamb
[33:55] slain before the foundation world it was
[33:57] done so before actually we are here yeah
[34:02] the blood's already been
[34:03] slain how far back well we don't know
[34:07] but actually we do know cuz it's there
[34:09] amen back there when he was alone with
[34:11] his thoughts and his thoughts were real
[34:13] as okay so the seeds
[34:17] now the seeds of everything were in that
[34:22] being of life so we're looking at seed
[34:25] sewn trees grown
[34:28] fruits shown so the seeds sown the seeds
[34:33] of everything the seeds of this was in
[34:36] that back
[34:37] then and the seeds of you and me we were
[34:40] also back there just turn to Ephesians 1
[34:45] Ephesians 1 we got a few
[34:48] scriptures Ephesians 1 we'll read
[34:52] 3:5 Ephesians 13:5 says Blessed Be
[34:57] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[34:58] Christ who has blessed us with all
[35:01] spiritual blessing remember it says
[35:02] blessed past tense past tense blessed
[35:05] with all spiritual blessings in heaven
[35:07] places that's present tense in heaven
[35:09] places in Christ and that's both present
[35:11] tense okay verse four according as he
[35:14] hath chosen past tense chosen Us in him
[35:18] before the foundation of the world that
[35:21] we should be holy Without Blame before
[35:23] him in love having
[35:25] predestined and I like to say
[35:27] predestinated
[35:30] predestination makes it a bit more
[35:31] understandable for me anyway you to be
[35:33] predestinated is nice but if we have a
[35:36] predestination it's already Destin you
[35:38] know anyway predestinated unto us um the
[35:41] adoption of the children by Jesus Christ
[35:43] to himself according to the good
[35:45] pleasure of his will so we can't
[35:48] remember it okay we cannot remember this
[35:50] but the Lord shown Us in his word that
[35:51] even back then even back then we were
[35:55] chosen in him
[35:57] in him before anything was created we
[36:00] were in the original seed of life okay
[36:06] we were in that original seed of life
[36:10] okay not manifested yet but we were
[36:11] there
[36:12] so the tree of life then and we'll see
[36:16] that later on the tree of life was in
[36:19] there Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the tree
[36:22] of life so so the tree of life began was
[36:25] way back then
[36:27] the tree of life because don't forget in
[36:29] the garden we got the two trees the tree
[36:30] of life and the the tree of knowledge of
[36:31] Good and Evil because all things were
[36:33] created by Him and for him we've just
[36:35] read it the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible
[36:36] teaches is is created by All Things by
[36:38] through the Lord Jesus Christ the tree
[36:40] of life he is the Tree of Life we'll see
[36:42] that later on as well you know when we
[36:43] read the quotes and that but we see the
[36:45] tree of life there's a tree of life
[36:47] Christ was back then so the origin of
[36:50] the Tree of Life Begins has no beginning
[36:53] amen the tree of life and he free iians
[36:56] 3:9 we won't read it in fact I'll read
[36:58] it for you quickly CU it's right
[37:00] here Ephesians 3:9 it says and to make
[37:05] all men see what is the Fellowship of
[37:06] the mystery which from the beginning
[37:07] that's this one we're talking about this
[37:09] is the this is the when he says from the
[37:10] beginning it's talking about this
[37:11] beginning yeah which from the beginning
[37:13] where's verse n beginning of of the
[37:15] world hath been hid in God who created
[37:19] All Things by Jesus Christ which wanted
[37:21] nail that one on the head because you
[37:23] know who created who did this that the
[37:25] Bible's fairly clear the Lord Jesus
[37:27] Christ did all things created all things
[37:29] that manifestation of God Called Jesus
[37:31] Christ the one our Lord and savior okay
[37:34] so the Lord Jesus Christ this in this
[37:37] here back here and I keep pointing down
[37:38] here but I'm saying there it is
[37:42] the it's the
[37:44] source of
[37:46] everything right it's the source of
[37:49] everything every everything that ever
[37:51] exists came from that back then right
[37:55] including the the
[37:57] seed of the tree of the knowledge of
[38:00] Good and Evil amen
[38:02] including the seed was created that seed
[38:05] of the knowledge of tree and good and
[38:07] evil was created back then for a
[38:10] purpose okay the Old Devil Lucifer was
[38:13] created I'm sorry amen and the seed was
[38:17] prepared it was a tool Lucifer the tool
[38:21] to bring out the attributes of
[38:24] God okay I've got I just want to the
[38:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost here brother
[38:27] Brown
[38:29] 1958 want to read something here says oh
[38:32] that's it yeah some people might
[38:35] struggle I mean even not us here
[38:37] obviously different places struggle to
[38:39] understand that Lucifer was created by
[38:42] God well if he wasn't then God was
[38:44] created by Lucifer there's got to be one
[38:46] you know what I mean doesn't work
[38:47] doesn't work okay so well you say then
[38:49] why did God the INF that God ever permit
[38:51] sin brother B says you know there's
[38:54] attributes in God and if God would have
[38:56] never permitted Satan he knew when he
[38:59] created Lucifer that he was to be the
[39:02] one to corrupt the world oh our God is
[39:06] not something little pushed off in the
[39:07] corner but he's an infinite God who
[39:09] never had a beginning and never will
[39:12] have an end and in him he is in his
[39:14] attributes he is a savior how could he
[39:16] ever be known as a savior if there
[39:17] hadn't been something to save how would
[39:19] we ever
[39:20] know so we see we know it already but we
[39:23] see the Lord created Lu Lucifer for a
[39:27] purpose amen and it was in the part it
[39:30] was it was in the plan of God you know
[39:32] the the seed that was planted back there
[39:35] called Lucifer it started notice it
[39:38] started as a seed this is the I hope
[39:40] you're going to catch my
[39:42] thought it's a it started as a seed I
[39:45] can actually maybe draw that in here
[39:47] somewhere yes I've uh I don't know how
[39:50] to delete brother
[39:51] Franco but it's all good right we're
[39:54] going to put here in here somewhere
[39:56] wrong turn it around quick right so I'm
[39:58] going to put here a little bit of grass
[40:00] and stuff and bit of soil you know it is
[40:04] who's a farmer in
[40:05] here boom Ron amen God bless you brother
[40:09] who
[40:10] else of course John gu gu what I saying
[40:14] yep sweet yep they caught the Revelation
[40:17] what can I
[40:18] say so that's a seed and I'm going to
[40:21] put here I'm going to put a little arrow
[40:23] there and I'm going to put Lucifer
[40:25] Lucifer
[40:27] you know this is a total side note you
[40:30] know there's only one mistake in the
[40:31] Bible for me
[40:33] right they give Satan a capital letter
[40:36] and
[40:37] Lucifer I never write Satan and Lucifer
[40:40] with a capital letter he don't deserve
[40:43] it it's true it's true it's just one of
[40:47] my little things so this seed called
[40:49] Lucifer started way back there yeah it
[40:53] started way back there maybe Millions
[40:56] ions of years ago I don't know only the
[40:57] Lord knows I'm I'm not that I ain't that
[40:59] clever but um if we
[41:02] notice the seed that was inside Lucifer
[41:06] when he created him the seed began to
[41:10] grow the seed you call it the seed of
[41:13] discrepancy the food seed of the false
[41:15] fine it began to grow Lucifer got puffed
[41:17] up in his own heart this when the seed
[41:20] began to grow that the Lord had placed
[41:22] in
[41:23] him okay that seed of the tree of
[41:25] knowledge evil when that seed started to
[41:28] grow it it had to start manifesting it
[41:32] was growing inside him that was it and
[41:34] you know he the result of that the
[41:36] fruits then that we began to see from
[41:38] this tree already back then is that we
[41:42] have Angels turning to worship Lucifer
[41:46] instead of
[41:48] God you know if we
[41:51] notice the Satan Lucifer he convinced
[41:55] other angels to worship
[41:58] him right so he began sewing the seeds
[42:03] from his own tree that had come out of
[42:05] his heart that was growing he began to
[42:07] sew the seeds before the Garden of Eden
[42:10] he began to sew those seeds of Doubt
[42:13] into the heart not say Hearts they don't
[42:15] have hearts into those
[42:17] angels and if we notice the angels that
[42:20] fell were also created to be
[42:24] deceivable amen okay okay this is all in
[42:26] God's great plan it's not a mistake I
[42:29] want you to think about these things
[42:30] just kind of think outside the box you
[42:31] know I always tell my folks you know the
[42:33] word of God's like a diamond you know
[42:36] and and and if we just kind of walk
[42:37] around the diamond we see the same
[42:39] diamond from so many angles and I'm not
[42:41] I'm not not just we see we see it and it
[42:43] just kind of opens and makes the picture
[42:45] bigger God created them in a way that
[42:48] they could be deceived now think about
[42:51] this
[42:51] now if those angels I love these
[42:55] questions if these angels could be
[42:58] deceived if those angels could be
[43:00] convinced listen carefully then God when
[43:04] he created those specific Angels the
[43:06] ones that he knew would fall he created
[43:08] them with some kind of level of free
[43:12] thinking agency think about
[43:15] it if we if we can be convinced or
[43:20] deceived it means that we can actually
[43:22] think for
[43:23] ourselves so God within those Angels he
[43:27] he gave them some kind of I wouldn't I
[43:30] don't want to say free moral agency
[43:31] because that refers to human beings but
[43:33] some kind of free thinking ability like
[43:36] ah yes boys come and worship me oh yes
[43:40] I'll give you a special long gown
[43:41] whatever is and there's oh sounds good
[43:45] sounds good you know I mean and they're
[43:46] thinking it's not just kind of like no
[43:49] no no no no it's like oh they're
[43:50] thinking that well maybe convincing
[43:53] sewing the
[43:55] seeds see it's it's it's quite nice to
[43:58] think these but it's true these things
[43:59] have to be if the Angels were deceived
[44:01] God firstly created them that they could
[44:03] be deceived and secondly they had some
[44:06] kind of free
[44:07] thinking
[44:09] okay so the seeds of discrepancy are
[44:12] then
[44:13] sewn in the minds of those angels I'm
[44:15] going to say mine not Soul they don't
[44:17] have souls and they fell okay and it's
[44:21] sometimes hard to understand
[44:23] but it had to be so God could be fully
[44:26] manifesting all his attributes so now
[44:29] there's war in
[44:30] heaven Lucifer and his angels are Now
[44:32] cast down and I don't have room to
[44:35] really put it in there in fact we could
[44:36] put it in there because you know for the
[44:37] younger ones it's easier to to kind of
[44:39] see if I put a
[44:41] a if I put a dotted line down that's
[44:44] kind of the time frame you remember time
[44:46] comes this way I'm saying time obviously
[44:48] we're not in time here at the moment but
[44:50] just to correct that one okay so so what
[44:53] did I say here I've forgotten already um
[44:56] yeah Angels that's it angels falling
[44:57] yeah so so Angels Angels cast down cast
[45:02] down okay and then yeah they're just
[45:05] down down and we can even draw them like
[45:08] kind of like laying flat for the kids to
[45:12] understand okay so they're cast down
[45:15] now and uh the seed that had started
[45:20] growing in Lucifer's I'm going to say
[45:22] his heart but he didn't have a heart but
[45:24] in Lucifer's heart as it were it grown
[45:26] it was grown to the point listen
[45:28] carefully the
[45:30] seed remember that he is the tree of
[45:32] life he start he always was the tree of
[45:34] life but there's a seed that begins and
[45:38] he's put in the heart of Lucifer I'm
[45:39] saying the heart of Lucifer you
[45:41] understand what I'm saying okay and now
[45:43] this seed has grown to the point that
[45:44] it's
[45:45] manifesting it's kind of bearing
[45:48] fruits right it was branching out now
[45:52] and it was enough mature enough we could
[45:54] say to have it own and now he's casting
[45:57] the seeds into the hearts of other
[45:59] Angels so the evil is Now cast down and
[46:03] you
[46:03] know let's just read uh Genesis 2 go
[46:07] back to Genesis 2 and this is now what
[46:10] really started my thought this morning
[46:12] was this question where did that tree
[46:14] come from so we'll read Genesis chapter
[46:17] [Music]
[46:18] 2 Genesis 2 and we're going read 8: 8
[46:21] and 9 and the Lord planted a garden
[46:24] Eastwood of Eden and there he put whom
[46:26] he created and out of the ground made he
[46:27] the Lord to grow every tree that is
[46:30] Pleasant to sight and good for food the
[46:32] tree of life also in the midst of the
[46:34] garden and the tree of knowledge of Good
[46:36] and Evil so now we see the tree of life
[46:39] is also in the Garden of Eden so now
[46:42] we're fast forwarded here the tree of
[46:44] life is here also so actually I could
[46:46] put here because it's remember that's
[46:48] with um with Adam and Adam and we'll say
[46:52] Eve we know it was Adam and Adam and
[46:53] we'll put the third man the Fourth Man
[46:55] in the fire as it were okay and I'll
[46:57] just put the pillar of fire over his
[46:58] head that's the Lord Jesus okay so he is
[47:01] he is in the Gard this tree of life okay
[47:06] is in the Garden of Eden also right 89
[47:11] now we'll read 16 and
[47:12] 17 and the Lord God commanded of the man
[47:17] saying of every tree in the garden thou
[47:19] mayest freely eat hang
[47:21] about brother Chad was touching on this
[47:23] when in this service that he took when
[47:25] he ministered Adam had access Adam and
[47:29] Eve we say Eve Adam they had access to
[47:31] that tree of life they had access to the
[47:33] Tree of Life they had
[47:35] communion walk with me they had access
[47:39] to the Tree of
[47:41] Life verse 17 but of the tree of the
[47:45] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[47:47] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[47:50] uh that thou eatest thou therefore of
[47:53] Thou shalt surely die
[47:56] so the question was where did this tree
[47:59] come from and now we see listen
[48:03] carefully now now we can see why it's a
[48:06] tree in the Garden of Eden it's not a
[48:10] seed in the Garden of Eden because the
[48:12] trees grown the seed started way back
[48:15] here so now we fast forward and in this
[48:18] tree of in the in the garden also and
[48:21] I'll have to put it in here as well we
[48:23] have um how am I going to draw this one
[48:26] two little
[48:28] horns we have also the tree of knowledge
[48:31] of Good and
[48:35] Evil okay it's not a seed in the Garden
[48:39] of Eden it's a
[48:40] tree it' been growing a long time and it
[48:43] started out as a seed in the heart of
[48:45] Lucifer okay but now it's a tree and
[48:50] it's bearing fruit notice the Lord says
[48:53] don't eat of the fruit of the tree he
[48:55] was you know brother Hadfield was the
[48:58] old brother that passed away it's
[48:59] thing's grandfather in it and he was the
[49:00] gardener wasn't he yeah that's uh sister
[49:03] Net's father is that right am I right
[49:06] yeah is that good yeah sweet he was a
[49:08] gardener that's it yeah he was a
[49:10] gardener so he knows all about this
[49:13] listen I love you know trees are nice
[49:16] we've got a few of them and I feel like
[49:17] chainsawing them down cuz they don't
[49:19] give much fruit but I tell you what what
[49:21] a couple of them do give fruit it took
[49:24] years for them to give fruit
[49:26] you can't plant a seed in the ground to
[49:27] the next year it gives fruit it takes
[49:29] some amount of maturing and this is what
[49:32] we're sort of seeing here because back
[49:34] here it's a seed the seed grows and it
[49:36] starts to grow in branches out and it
[49:37] starts to bear fruit and the seeds are
[49:40] cast to the other angels and we're fast
[49:41] forward here and now we've got a fully
[49:43] grown tree now in and it's bearing fruit
[49:47] and that's what the Lord says don't eat
[49:51] am so what we saw this perverting and
[49:53] the deceiving that was going on in the
[49:55] in the the Garden of Eden was the fruit
[49:57] that started out as the seed that was
[50:00] sown now the trees grown and now the
[50:03] fruits being
[50:06] shown so when the Lord created
[50:09] Lucifer he made him with the seed of the
[50:13] false Vine that would grow into what we
[50:15] see today he planted him with that seed
[50:18] inside him and that's where the tree
[50:21] came from that we saw in the Garden of
[50:22] Eden so now it's hard to understand
[50:24] sometimes you know well how can he do
[50:26] that and how can he create something
[50:27] with evil in him well the scripture also
[50:29] says is there any evil done in the city
[50:30] that God hasn't done himself he's got a
[50:32] way of doing things he's got a way of
[50:33] making and manifesting to bring out the
[50:36] adversary the perfect adversary to bring
[50:38] out his attributes but think about you
[50:41] know the Lord is to help us just to to
[50:42] think on that one the Lord is so perfect
[50:45] can any of you in here
[50:47] forget other than me seriously anybody
[50:50] can forget right brother John is it
[50:52] brother John brother John when's you
[50:55] know remember that time last uh last
[50:57] week that somebody stamped on your foot
[50:59] I'm just saying you
[51:01] know and it hurt yep and you were a bit
[51:06] see we we we we remember things I kind
[51:09] of remember things we we we try to
[51:11] forget and we forgive people it's
[51:13] amazing how we we forgive people and I
[51:15] had the Revelation a while ago that you
[51:17] know if we just forgive people of the
[51:19] evil they do to us then all that is left
[51:22] is the good that they've done to us if
[51:24] it's someone in relationship so we truly
[51:26] have to forgive people from our heart
[51:28] but you know it's funny how and and the
[51:31] Lord knows my heart I I I just love
[51:32] people I just love everybody and I and
[51:34] some people kind of upset me and but you
[51:37] know and they've been nasty to me and
[51:39] and you forgive them and you pray for
[51:40] them it's like oh Lord I've got over
[51:41] that one and then something else happens
[51:44] and it brings back all the old memories
[51:47] see we struggle to forget in these
[51:50] bodies God is so great that he can even
[51:54] forget right and I'm not talking about
[51:57] like you Computer Guys in here you know
[51:59] I struggle to drive my phone but you
[52:01] know you computer guys you can go back
[52:03] into the computer and find stuff that's
[52:05] been deleted years ago we're not talking
[52:07] about that kind of empty the the what
[52:09] you call it a bin on the FI empty the
[52:11] bin on your computer we're not talking
[52:14] about that we're talking about total
[52:16] forgetness for toal forget forgetness
[52:18] it's not even a word forget
[52:20] forgetfulness total memory loss the Lord
[52:23] is so perfect he can actually have a
[52:25] total memory loss that makes the older
[52:28] people in here feel pretty good it just
[52:30] makes us more
[52:33] spiritual see God is so high above all
[52:36] our ways when God created Lucifer for
[52:38] his perfect plan he actually created
[52:41] within Lucifer a go wrong
[52:44] chip amen he created a little chip in
[52:47] there that was going to go wrong a bit
[52:50] like our fridge and freezer you know
[52:52] what I mean know a bit like a Chevy
[52:56] aan he's got he's got that go wrong chip
[52:58] built in and and all the angels that
[53:00] were going to
[53:01] fall were created with the same chip see
[53:06] it's not it's perfect it's so perfect
[53:08] when God created he engineered Lucifer
[53:11] to make him so that he would fall and
[53:14] become Satan he would be a further
[53:16] manifestation or a further yeah
[53:18] manifestations good the attributes of
[53:20] him were going to come out and unfold
[53:22] into this picture called
[53:24] Satan he created him as Lucifer he
[53:26] became Satan it was no mistake and when
[53:29] the Lord created you and me it was so
[53:31] perfectly engineered perfectly that even
[53:35] though we go through the truest T trials
[53:37] and tribulations you know the seed
[53:39] within us it just keeps growing never
[53:42] stops
[53:43] growing yeah the Lord's good we are so
[53:46] perfectly made to fulfill the role we
[53:48] have here to fulfill the role and you
[53:51] know I think Brother Kyle preached about
[53:53] the scars and listen listen to that that
[53:56] was beautiful and it touched my heart
[53:58] but you know each limp we have each scar
[54:01] we have everything we've ever gone
[54:03] through is for us to be that Perfect
[54:05] Bride he so Engineers us so that we can
[54:08] fulfill our role perfectly and listen if
[54:11] God takes such extremes to mold you and
[54:14] me do you think that he does any less
[54:17] when he creates his greatest
[54:19] adversary he he makes him an engineered
[54:22] Lucifer so perfectly to be that
[54:26] enemy he knew what the tree of the tree
[54:29] was going to look like before it was
[54:30] even a tree when it was still a seed so
[54:32] the Garden of Eden now there's two
[54:35] trees one is the tree of Satan the false
[54:38] Vine and the other is the Tree of Life
[54:40] The True Vine read the Paradox a quote
[54:44] from Paradox in
[54:46] 1964 um Jesus was the Tree of Life from
[54:50] the Garden of Eden do you believe that
[54:51] congregation says amen he was the Tree
[54:54] of Life there was a tree in the garden
[54:57] one of them was if you if he touched it
[54:59] now we have our differen he's obviously
[55:00] preaching the mix congregation he says
[55:02] now we have our differences on that so I
[55:03] won't go into it but let's say it's a
[55:05] tree of Disobedience he's being very
[55:07] gentle with the people Disobedience as
[55:09] soon as they touch that tree all the
[55:11] people was to die and they had to put
[55:13] them away from this other tree CU if
[55:15] they eat this tree of life they would
[55:16] all live see what I mean so so we have
[55:20] it's like the tree of life is so so
[55:23] powerful the tree of life was so
[55:25] powerful even if they've done wrong if
[55:26] they quickly went and touched and ate
[55:27] from the Tree of Life that's it they'
[55:28] got life again the Lord Jesus doesn't
[55:31] matter who you are what you are what
[55:32] your condition is how low you sunk in
[55:34] sin you come and eat of that tree of
[55:35] life you've got eternal life that's
[55:38] it cuz if they eat of this tree of life
[55:40] they would live knowing right from wrong
[55:42] that's right you probably you you know
[55:44] that as ministers we have our ideas on
[55:46] that and we probably differ what the
[55:48] tree was but we can all know that Christ
[55:50] is that tree of life amen the Lord is
[55:54] good amen so we have our two trees the
[55:57] two Vines and now we see where they come
[56:00] from and how they
[56:02] started and we see how they are both
[56:05] bearing this fruit they're both bearing
[56:07] fruit they're both mature think about
[56:10] this in the Garden of Eden it was a tree
[56:12] it was not a seed trees bear fruit seeds
[56:14] don't bear fruits they were both mature
[56:17] in the Garden of Eden yes amen you know
[56:20] before the fall the Lord walked with
[56:23] Adam the Lord walked with Adam this is
[56:25] the communion they had the access they
[56:26] had to the fruit of the tree of life but
[56:30] the the the invisible tree the tree of
[56:32] knowledge of good even we say it's
[56:34] invisible the fruit of that tree caused
[56:37] the Divide between God and
[56:40] man and hence quickly barring the way
[56:43] because although now they've sinned they
[56:46] go and eat of the fruit of that tree as
[56:48] brother R says they're suddenly going to
[56:49] live again so the way had to be bad so
[56:52] now this this Fellowship this Walking
[56:53] with God has been
[56:56] lost until now it's lost until now and
[57:00] we've seen it again first we've seen it
[57:02] in brother Bram when he the Lord the
[57:05] same one here which is there turns to
[57:08] brother BR says walk with me yes see
[57:11] it's now it's it's it's been restored
[57:14] this this tree is being restored the The
[57:16] Obedience to the word is what brought on
[57:19] the fellowship and the walk with me amen
[57:22] everybody wants to be you know I've said
[57:23] it before everybody everyone want to um
[57:26] everyone wants to uh be the husband of
[57:29] the king but nobody wants to bake the
[57:30] cake for him you know I mean it's like
[57:32] everybody wants to walk with walk with
[57:34] God like like brother bam but nobody
[57:36] wants to give that life a sacrifice and
[57:39] I know we all do that's our our hearts
[57:41] our heart is to give that sacrifice but
[57:43] that's what brings that Fellowship back
[57:45] is the true obedience and you know I
[57:49] think brother brother Chad said didn't
[57:50] he he said if you if we could just get
[57:51] to the point where we only ever eat of
[57:53] the Tree of Life yes and then we get
[57:55] that eternity kind of thing blending in
[57:58] though we're dead yet we live you know
[58:01] though we're old and we look a bit worn
[58:04] out second hand you're
[58:06] still young it's a paradox you're young
[58:10] and you're you're old and all is well so
[58:13] now after the fall now the way to the
[58:16] tree of life was blocked it was bad and
[58:20] the angels are placed that's Genesis 3
[58:22] uh 24 I'll read that 3:24 I can read it
[58:25] quickly all right J and he drove out the
[58:28] man and he placed to the east of the
[58:29] Garden of Eden Cherry abins notice it's
[58:32] beautiful I've just seen that listen the
[58:34] east of the Garden of Eden we're going
[58:36] to meet at the Eastern Gate in the New
[58:38] Jerusalem you know the way that was
[58:40] blocked is going to be opened again it's
[58:42] awesome he drove out the man and placed
[58:44] him at the east of the Garden of Eden
[58:45] cherub beims and a flaming sword which
[58:48] to which turn every way to keep the way
[58:52] of the tree of life amen
[58:56] so this tree now the the way the Flaming
[59:00] sword has been put there to block the
[59:03] way the access to this tree of life and
[59:07] the word of God is quicker than any
[59:08] sharper than any two-edged sword it's
[59:11] the word of God is's put there to guard
[59:13] the way to the tree of life and the way
[59:16] to the tree of life is the way to Jesus
[59:18] Christ and it was blocked until he came
[59:21] to redeem us by his blood and now the
[59:25] way the way the way to life was blocked
[59:29] until he came himself okay now I just
[59:32] want you to hold your hands in Genesis
[59:34] 3:24 and flick over to John 14 just go
[59:37] to John
[59:39] 14 John 14
[59:44] 6 John
[59:46] 14
[59:48] 6 Lord Jesus says I am listen I am the
[59:53] way the the truth and the life no man
[59:57] cometh unto the father but by me you see
[1:00:01] look the way that was blocked came to
[1:00:03] open the sorry the way which was
[1:00:06] blocked the way came to open the way
[1:00:09] that was
[1:00:10] blocked see the way the same I am the
[1:00:13] way that I am that I am the way came to
[1:00:16] open the way that was blocked Amen to
[1:00:19] himself he came to open that he the
[1:00:22] revealed word the word of the hour is
[1:00:24] the way back to the tree of life amen
[1:00:28] and no no one can come to the father no
[1:00:30] one can come back to this one nobody can
[1:00:33] come back to this one here unless you go
[1:00:35] through the
[1:00:36] cross no one can come there but by me
[1:00:39] the way now was veiled there was a veil
[1:00:42] over the way but the way was opened when
[1:00:45] he rent the twain the veil in Twain he
[1:00:49] ripped the curtain open that went into
[1:00:51] the holiest of holies he rent The Veil
[1:00:54] he he opened the way again he opened the
[1:00:56] way to the inner holiest of holies into
[1:00:59] the to the way of life to the Tree of
[1:01:01] Life The Rail was rent and and behind
[1:01:03] that Veil if we had been standing in the
[1:01:06] synagogue kind of looking there you know
[1:01:08] like all righteous and religious you
[1:01:10] know because now we're inside the
[1:01:11] synagogue and the Lord Jesus is out
[1:01:12] there hanging on the cross um you know
[1:01:14] if you were a Pharisee when the veil was
[1:01:16] written in between you could have looked
[1:01:17] out through the window and seen the way
[1:01:20] hanging on the tree the way was blocked
[1:01:23] the the curtain was there Badger skins
[1:01:25] and all the rest of it it was totally
[1:01:27] sealed totally protected by the Flaming
[1:01:30] sword the word of God but when he ripped
[1:01:32] it open what did we see we saw the tree
[1:01:35] of
[1:01:36] life that's what we saw we saw the
[1:01:39] access back and anybody that eats of the
[1:01:41] fruit of that tree gets life again
[1:01:44] though you are dead yet shall you live
[1:01:47] that's the way back amen yeah see behind
[1:01:50] the veil now what we see behind the veil
[1:01:53] is not just a tree but it's a fully
[1:01:55] matur tree yeah and he's bearing all the
[1:01:59] fruits it's bearing all the fruits the
[1:02:01] attributes of the Savior the Healer
[1:02:03] anyone in here needs healing today it's
[1:02:05] there the fruit's there reach out and
[1:02:07] take it go behind the veil just behind
[1:02:10] the veil we long to see his face what we
[1:02:13] long to see his face we can see his face
[1:02:16] the veil has been torn open just grabbed
[1:02:17] the fruit the Lord's telling us just
[1:02:20] grab it now not to eat the fruit is
[1:02:25] death not to eat the fruit is death
[1:02:29] notice now this tree of
[1:02:31] life it begin to it begins to bear
[1:02:34] fruit through his bride the fruit of the
[1:02:38] spirit and if we notice the spirit in US
[1:02:42] produces the same fruits like he the
[1:02:47] same fruits we are bearing the same
[1:02:50] fruits as the original tree because
[1:02:52] that's where we come from yeah we come
[1:02:56] from that original scene we were in here
[1:02:59] brother Franco I'm going to try this
[1:03:01] look at
[1:03:02] that he said you can even Zoom but hey

[1:03:47] that but it's me I'm in there I'm in
[1:03:49] there too like that oh that's too much
[1:03:52] I'm not very good I'm getting used to
[1:03:53] this
[1:03:56] the Lord's
[1:03:57] good let's read Galatians 5 Galatians
[1:04:01] 5 Galatians chapter
[1:04:04] 5 and we'll read 22-
[1:04:13] 25 22-25 Galatians
[1:04:17] 5 but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:04:21] joy peace longsuffering Gent goodness
[1:04:25] Faith meekness Temperance against such
[1:04:28] there is no law and if they that are
[1:04:31] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:04:34] affections and lusts if we walk if we
[1:04:37] live in the spirit let us also walk in
[1:04:40] the
[1:04:41] spirit see that's the fruit of his life
[1:04:43] that's being manifested in us that that
[1:04:46] seed of life that was planted in us when
[1:04:48] we came to the Lord It's been growing
[1:04:51] and it gets to the point where you can't
[1:04:53] hide it anymore amen and it gets to the
[1:04:55] point where it starts bearing the fruit
[1:04:57] and we don't look back with pride and
[1:04:58] say well look at me how far I've come
[1:05:00] cuz yeah we don't do that but you know
[1:05:03] what I mean but it's like but we can see
[1:05:05] that so it does help to sometimes take a
[1:05:07] moment look in the mirror and say Lord
[1:05:09] that's your grace look what you've done
[1:05:11] you've actually brought me this far I
[1:05:13] can't believe it I tell you you I used
[1:05:15] to be message believer everyone thought
[1:05:17] that I was the perfect message believe I
[1:05:19] wasn't and I knew I wasn't I knew I
[1:05:22] wasn't I was just as worldly as and
[1:05:24] there was a time that came when the Lord
[1:05:25] turned me around you know the Lord you
[1:05:28] know we all think we all think you know
[1:05:29] it's a blessing for the young ones to be
[1:05:30] raised in the message it really is it
[1:05:32] truly is when you've got God-fearing
[1:05:33] Holy Ghost filled parents
[1:05:35] absolutely it's the best but you know
[1:05:38] it's also not
[1:05:39] easy you know I was you raised in the
[1:05:42] message and you're raised and and
[1:05:44] compromise begins to come in and you end
[1:05:46] up just as worldly as but there's always
[1:05:49] been that seed inside and sometime at
[1:05:52] some point in time a specific time the
[1:05:54] Lord starts to get that seed growing and
[1:05:56] it ends up that you can't hide
[1:05:59] it can't hide it and it starts to bear
[1:06:02] fruit and the fruit that we bear is the
[1:06:04] fruit of the tree of
[1:06:07] life you know let's just turn our
[1:06:11] Diamond a little bit we'll look at the
[1:06:13] manifestation of what's on the inside of
[1:06:16] the
[1:06:16] seed the manifestation of what no no
[1:06:19] it's in the Garden of
[1:06:20] Eden Cain
[1:06:23] manifested what was inside the seed that
[1:06:26] was inside him he was manifesting that
[1:06:29] and he bore the fruit of the tree that
[1:06:32] was growing in him amen so remember the
[1:06:35] seed that started way back there in the
[1:06:37] heart of we say the heart of Lucifer
[1:06:39] okay the same seed was sewn into the
[1:06:42] fallen angels and the same seed now is
[1:06:44] in can and begins to bear fruit of that
[1:06:48] Original Seed that was
[1:06:50] planted so notice the way that Abel he
[1:06:53] just had it in him to bring the right
[1:06:55] thing he didn't have to try hard he just
[1:06:57] kind of he just he just did it he just
[1:06:59] had it inside him and you know the the
[1:07:03] seed that was inside the seed that was
[1:07:04] inside of him he was manifesting that
[1:07:07] life seed that was inside he probably
[1:07:09] didn't even know what he was doing truly
[1:07:11] he you know we we can we can lay all
[1:07:13] sorts of um scenarios out and well he
[1:07:16] looks at his brother and he's got six
[1:07:17] fingers and he's got five and he doesn't
[1:07:20] know what Grace is as it were he he
[1:07:22] doesn't know what five is Grace six his
[1:07:24] man no he's got six fingers and I've got
[1:07:26] five and he's that big and I'm this
[1:07:28] small and he looks at his parents and
[1:07:29] thinks well my dad's not that big um you
[1:07:31] he doesn't maybe he didn't even think
[1:07:33] that but just in him listen I don't
[1:07:36] think the apple tree has to think very
[1:07:38] hard it just does it brother likes to
[1:07:42] talk about I think it's talks about the
[1:07:44] Sheep bearing the wool and stuff we can
[1:07:46] testify to that one he just grows they
[1:07:48] don't have to think about it it just
[1:07:50] kind of just bears that
[1:07:52] fruit
[1:07:55] okay
[1:07:57] so uh Abel Abel brings the right ad
[1:08:00] right he brings the right sacrifice and
[1:08:02] now Kain was the same he couldn't help
[1:08:05] but manifest what was inside him he
[1:08:06] couldn't help it it just came out and
[1:08:08] what it was he he was manifesting the
[1:08:10] seed from his father who was the devil
[1:08:13] the seed that was in there full of lies
[1:08:16] and deception let's just read one John
[1:08:18] number one John just to nail this one on
[1:08:20] the head one John that's the one John at
[1:08:22] the end there 1 John
[1:08:26] 3 1 John 3 and we're going to read 11 to
[1:08:30] 12 11 and
[1:08:32] 12 11 and 12 says for this is the
[1:08:34] message that we heard from the beginning
[1:08:36] that we should love one another hang
[1:08:38] about just pause one second this is the
[1:08:40] message that we've heard from the
[1:08:41] beginning the beginning of what the
[1:08:43] beginning of the beginning whether it
[1:08:45] was preached or not inside that one with
[1:08:47] sister
[1:08:48] Joyce was
[1:08:51] love was love why did the whole planet
[1:08:53] of redemption start because God loved us
[1:08:56] God loved that attribute that was inside
[1:08:58] him he loved it and so the Plan of
[1:09:00] Redemption starts so this love is not a
[1:09:02] new thing okay this this love began
[1:09:04] there at the
[1:09:06] beginning so it says here for this is
[1:09:08] the message we've heard from the
[1:09:08] beginning that we should love one
[1:09:10] another not as Cain who was of that
[1:09:13] Wicked one okay and slew his brother and
[1:09:16] wherefore slew him because his own Works
[1:09:17] were evil and his brothers righteous his
[1:09:20] fruit was evil and his brother was
[1:09:22] righteous and back then the false Vine
[1:09:25] he trying to kill off the True
[1:09:27] Vine
[1:09:29] tried so he was of the wicked one so all
[1:09:31] he could do all that Cain could do is to
[1:09:34] manifest the characteristic of his
[1:09:35] father you know I've said it to our
[1:09:37] church but you just look at me this prob
[1:09:39] you don't know me that well but if you
[1:09:40] look at me I'm going to be dead honest
[1:09:41] with you we've got this huge sort of
[1:09:42] forehead thing that sticks out it's an
[1:09:45] Abbot thing we've got massive teeth at
[1:09:47] front two massive teeth we've all got
[1:09:48] teeth problems we've got massive teeth
[1:09:50] massive teeth I'm like a donkey right
[1:09:54] point is me dad's got the same me
[1:09:58] granddad's got the same me Grandad me
[1:10:01] Nana had these big teeth we it's just
[1:10:03] kind of the Abbot thing sorry
[1:10:06] Josh you I mean I'm not saying it's a
[1:10:09] bad thing son I'm just saying we could I
[1:10:11] couldn't help so when I was born I
[1:10:13] didn't I didn't kind of choose to look
[1:10:14] like this all I can do is to
[1:10:17] manifest the characteristics of the
[1:10:21] father that's all we can do and K was
[1:10:23] the same all he could do is Manifest the
[1:10:25] characteristics of his father so if we
[1:10:28] notice now one of the characteristics of
[1:10:30] Cain is is is when the Lord questions
[1:10:32] him where's your brother you know he
[1:10:34] turns around to him he says how do I
[1:10:36] know go look yourself and my brother
[1:10:38] like in modern language go and have a
[1:10:40] look yourself am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:10:42] yeah what the cheek straight to the face
[1:10:46] of God right and then when he's cast
[1:10:49] down to be a vagabond okay he turns
[1:10:51] around and says no it's too much for me
[1:10:55] so what I'm thinking is this is timeon
[1:10:57] now the attitude that he had if he's
[1:11:00] expressing the characteristics of his
[1:11:01] father what did Lucifer say when the
[1:11:04] Lord's casting him and his little Merry
[1:11:06] band of angels down no don't do that to
[1:11:09] me you what I mean it's it's like he's
[1:11:11] casting him down and he'll have the same
[1:11:14] attitude because if you look at the sun
[1:11:16] yeah you know you'll see the
[1:11:19] father that's
[1:11:22] it crazy the same fruit will be produced
[1:11:25] by the son that was in the
[1:11:26] father notice here Cain part of his
[1:11:30] characteristics was you know and this
[1:11:32] this manifesting the life that's in him
[1:11:34] part of the characteristics of
[1:11:36] Cain was to be religious religious
[1:11:40] notice how his church was all nice and
[1:11:45] Polished and oh he didn't just lay the
[1:11:48] fruit out in the church oh no he swept
[1:11:50] the floor and everything swept the floor
[1:11:52] and put some nice flower in ments
[1:11:54] brought the fruit and you know I'm sure
[1:11:57] that his worship music was all kind of
[1:11:59] touchy touchy Fey Fey make everyone
[1:12:01] comfortable and playing on his little
[1:12:03] flute or something I don't know point is
[1:12:05] the
[1:12:06] contrast the contrast he was this
[1:12:09] religious person just like his father
[1:12:13] listen carefully
[1:12:15] Church Lucifer was in charge of worship
[1:12:19] I think he knows how to make the folks
[1:12:21] feel
[1:12:22] good it's like all those angels that
[1:12:24] fell that had that go wrong chip inside
[1:12:27] them how did he lure
[1:12:32] them oh it feels so good hey ho hey all
[1:12:36] that junky music worship feeling he was
[1:12:40] in charge of worship he
[1:12:42] knew what do we see today I'm just going
[1:12:44] to move on
[1:12:46] here see it's these two Vines
[1:12:50] growing when the Lord made Lucifer he
[1:12:53] made made it so that all the types would
[1:12:56] be perfect all the way from that point
[1:12:59] ever onwards it was all in there it was
[1:13:01] all programmed within the seed these two
[1:13:03] Vines growing side by side the one the
[1:13:05] tree of knowledge and the other one the
[1:13:07] tree of
[1:13:08] life and they're all bearing fruit
[1:13:10] they're both bearing fruits fruits now
[1:13:13] that show their
[1:13:15] origin want to read this quote man
[1:13:17] running from the presence of
[1:13:18] God in
[1:13:21] 65 brother says you can see people today
[1:13:26] there is two Spirits whoa whoo whoa whoa
[1:13:27] he's just fast forwarded now he's just
[1:13:30] fast forwarded now to today so he says
[1:13:32] you see here people today there's two
[1:13:34] Spirits one of them is the Holy Spirit
[1:13:35] the other one is an Unholy Spirit one is
[1:13:38] and one as in a person and one is
[1:13:40] governed by that and both of them
[1:13:43] religious now yeah there's a strange
[1:13:45] part they're both religious just like
[1:13:48] Esau and Jacob was both religious like
[1:13:50] Cain and Abel both religious like Judas
[1:13:52] and Jesus both religious both religion
[1:13:56] we see it today both sides religious see
[1:13:59] it's the same Spirit the people die but
[1:14:01] the spirit doesn't die goes right on
[1:14:03] both religious one of them is possessed
[1:14:05] with the Holy Spirit and lives that kind
[1:14:07] of life that they should live and walk
[1:14:08] Godly and honest and they wouldn't beat
[1:14:10] you out of a penny they just do
[1:14:12] everything honest they can to help you
[1:14:14] and the others will just be as nice as
[1:14:16] can be the others we find out is just
[1:14:18] the vice versa and yet both of them are
[1:14:21] religious Spirits two of them one Holy
[1:14:24] Spirit the other one un Holy Spirit if
[1:14:25] you noticed it'll even um it'll even
[1:14:29] claim through claiming religion they'll
[1:14:32] make fun of you and call you a Holy
[1:14:34] Roller they do everything they can so we
[1:14:37] see these two Spirits we see Cain and
[1:14:40] Abel Moses Kora we see Judas and Jesus
[1:14:44] and brother R was saying that we still
[1:14:45] see it
[1:14:46] today listen you
[1:14:48] know the false Vine is not some ugly old
[1:14:53] old priest in some musty old
[1:14:57] cave luring you in come on in come on in
[1:15:02] it's not it's it's not some kind of you
[1:15:05] it's it's it's pretty it's beautiful
[1:15:07] it's religious it's smooth oh yeah it's
[1:15:11] smooth smooth talking smooth it's nice
[1:15:13] it's warm and it's cuddly and well God
[1:15:16] just loves everyone God loves you the
[1:15:19] way you are that's not a lie but if you
[1:15:23] say it God loves you the way they are
[1:15:25] you know and you're still living wrong
[1:15:28] then you're saying God loves the way you
[1:15:29] are you stay like that but if you say
[1:15:31] God loves you the way you are now come
[1:15:32] to the altar that's another story you
[1:15:35] know God loves you the way you are but
[1:15:37] he didn't love me the way I was 20 years
[1:15:39] ago although he loved me the way I was
[1:15:41] do you
[1:15:42] understand okay so the false Vine is now
[1:15:46] so disguised so disguised that we're
[1:15:50] hardly able to tell the difference we're
[1:15:51] just going to read about that let's turn
[1:15:53] to to John 13 John 13 Book of John John
[1:15:56] 13 John
[1:16:00] 13 John 13 and we'll read
[1:16:04] 21-29 John 13
[1:16:09] 21-29 this is I like this I like this
[1:16:13] scripture says when Jesus had thus said
[1:16:15] he was troubled in spirit and testified
[1:16:18] and said verily verily I say unto you
[1:16:21] that one of you should betay me now just
[1:16:24] listen he sat there with the
[1:16:27] disciples okay the last supper okay he
[1:16:31] sat there with his disciples around
[1:16:33] him and he says now that one of you one
[1:16:37] of you and there was 12 there he's going
[1:16:39] to he's going to betray me says then
[1:16:42] verse 22 then the disciples looked one
[1:16:44] another doubting of whom he spoke he now
[1:16:48] that was leaning on jesus' bosom one of
[1:16:50] the disciples who Jesus loved Simon
[1:16:53] Peter therefore beckoned to
[1:16:55] him John John Pitts and burger
[1:17:00] John who is it who is it you can just
[1:17:04] imagine the scene everyone's asking who
[1:17:08] is it ask him who it
[1:17:10] is who who it should be of whom he spake
[1:17:13] then he lying on jesus' breast that's
[1:17:15] John brother John sayth unto him Lord
[1:17:18] who is
[1:17:21] it then Jes Jesus answered he it is now
[1:17:25] listen carefully he it
[1:17:27] is whom I shall whom I shall give a so
[1:17:32] when I have dipped it and when he had
[1:17:35] dipped the so he gave it to Judas
[1:17:37] Iscariot the son of
[1:17:40] Simon Just pause this just the how many
[1:17:44] young ones have got in here anyway got a
[1:17:45] few let's just we're moving on here with
[1:17:47] this time
[1:17:49] thing so we're moving on oh I can't draw
[1:17:52] there can I so we're moving along with
[1:17:53] our time thing and we get to the point
[1:17:56] where we're at the cross this is the
[1:17:59] cross okay so now just before the cross
[1:18:02] that's here here okay we have uh the
[1:18:06] Lord
[1:18:07] Jesus okay and he is holding a
[1:18:12] bread okay so now we go on to the next
[1:18:16] little part of the story he takes the
[1:18:18] bread this is for the younger ones he
[1:18:20] walks across and he takes the bread and
[1:18:23] he dips it into the bowl with the
[1:18:27] so and then he he goes and there's
[1:18:32] little Judas there with his
[1:18:35] horns okay and now the Lord Jesus is the
[1:18:38] Lord Jesus pillar fire here again the
[1:18:39] Lord Jesus comes and gives it to him the
[1:18:42] up
[1:18:45] okay who do you think it was who was
[1:18:48] going to betray
[1:18:51] you
[1:18:54] I'm going to take a
[1:18:55] so and I'm going to dip it in that food
[1:18:59] and then I'm going to give it to the one
[1:19:01] who's going to betray
[1:19:07] me J just put out your
[1:19:18] hand after this oh wait I've got to read
[1:19:20] to 29 I so right 27 after the stop Satan
[1:19:25] entered into him then said Jesus to him
[1:19:27] that doest thou do it thou quickly now
[1:19:30] no man at the table knew for what intent
[1:19:32] he SP this
[1:19:36] to give me your
[1:19:38] hand now go and do what you got to
[1:19:42] do
[1:19:44] right for some of them thought because
[1:19:47] Judas had the bag that Jesus had said
[1:19:49] unto him buy those things that we have
[1:19:51] need against the feast or or that he
[1:19:53] should give something to the
[1:19:56] poor after all that that's
[1:19:59] happened they're still looking at one
[1:20:02] another he's so
[1:20:05] disguised right Judas had gone out to
[1:20:08] betray the Lord right but because he's
[1:20:12] so
[1:20:13] religious because he's so well disguised
[1:20:15] nobody even
[1:20:18] guest in fact in fact this is just Simon
[1:20:21] now but if you asked Simon Peter in
[1:20:25] Gethsemane while he's like half falling
[1:20:27] asleep and waking up and he like wakes
[1:20:29] up this is just Simon wakes up he say
[1:20:31] hey Simon I've just had a quick count up
[1:20:33] me there's only 11 of us do you know
[1:20:34] where Judas is he be like oh yeah he's
[1:20:36] just gone to feed the poor true true
[1:20:40] they had no idea because he was so
[1:20:44] disguised unbelievable Judas did not
[1:20:48] have horns gr out of his head he didn't
[1:20:51] mate nobody guest see this religious
[1:20:55] facade is hiding the seed that's on the
[1:20:59] inside you see and the seed that was
[1:21:02] planted in Judas was the same seed that
[1:21:05] was planted in Cain it was the same seed
[1:21:08] from the same tree that was planted in
[1:21:10] Lucifer's heart back at the
[1:21:12] beginning remember we read the
[1:21:14] scriptures he was of the evil one yeah
[1:21:17] okay and he was the son of
[1:21:20] pedition so now we've got these two
[1:21:22] growing together we got Jesus and Judas
[1:21:24] and they're both manifesting the fruit
[1:21:26] the Son of God the son of predition the
[1:21:27] two trees and trees give fruit not seeds
[1:21:31] trees Now by seeing the fruit that's
[1:21:33] growing on the trees you know you can
[1:21:35] tell what sort of seed they come from
[1:21:38] you can tell where they come from and
[1:21:40] the Lord Jesus said by their fruits ye
[1:21:42] shall know
[1:21:44] them and every person listen every
[1:21:47] person that has ever lived comes from a
[1:21:50] source either inside them they have the
[1:21:53] seed of life or the seed of death yes
[1:21:56] it's in every single one there is no
[1:21:57] there's no way either the true of life
[1:21:59] or the false Vine you can't see
[1:22:00] outwardly who it is you see it with
[1:22:02] Judas you can't always see outwardly who
[1:22:04] it is this religious this this this
[1:22:07] disguise but the by the fruits the
[1:22:10] fruits cannot lie the fruits can't lie
[1:22:14] the the tree has to Bear the fruit
[1:22:16] according to the seed it's got no choice
[1:22:19] so
[1:22:20] now uh how Judas Del of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:23] to death is exactly the same as what was
[1:22:25] in the seed in the Garden of Eden when
[1:22:27] Cain kills his brother it's the same one
[1:22:30] exactly like Cain did in the Garden of
[1:22:32] Eden it's the same fruit so he's
[1:22:34] manifesting the same uh attributes it's
[1:22:38] manifesting the same characteristics and
[1:22:40] both of them are religious yes both of
[1:22:43] them are religious but now they've both
[1:22:46] got this religious disguise Cain and
[1:22:48] Judas it's the same religious disguise
[1:22:51] okay but the fruit always show shows
[1:22:53] what is Original Seed let's read Matthew
[1:22:56] 23 Matthew 23 if we can
[1:23:00] please Matthew
[1:23:06] 23 and we're just going to read 27- 31
[1:23:09] please
[1:23:11] 27-31 now this is the Lord Jesus
[1:23:13] speaking to somebody who's also got that
[1:23:16] same seed
[1:23:17] inside 27- 31 I said yep yep W to you
[1:23:22] scribes Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are
[1:23:24] like unto Whited slicers which indeed
[1:23:27] appear beautiful outwardly but within
[1:23:29] are full of dead men's bones and of
[1:23:32] uncleanness even so ye outwardly appear
[1:23:35] righteous unto men but within ye are
[1:23:38] full of hypocrisy and iniquity listen
[1:23:40] the Lord Jesus here is pointing to the
[1:23:42] seed that's on the inside of
[1:23:44] him okay woe unto you scribes uh and
[1:23:47] Pharisees Hypocrites because ye build
[1:23:49] the tombs of the prophets and garnish
[1:23:52] the suppliers of the righteous and say
[1:23:54] if we'd have been in the days of our
[1:23:56] fathers we would not have been partakers
[1:23:57] with them in the blood of the prophets
[1:23:59] wherefore ye be Witnesses unto
[1:24:01] yourselves that ye are the children of
[1:24:03] them which killed the
[1:24:05] prophets mate see these Pharisees their
[1:24:09] fruit the their fruit they were bearing
[1:24:12] the fruit uh the same fruit that killed
[1:24:14] the prophets of old amen okay out of
[1:24:17] their own mouth the tree that killed the
[1:24:20] prophets of old right they were
[1:24:23] manifesting the same fruit before the
[1:24:26] Lord they were saying out their own Sid
[1:24:28] look basically the Lord Jesus is saying
[1:24:31] look because you're bearing the fruit
[1:24:34] I'm seeing what seed you come from and
[1:24:36] the seed that you come from is the one
[1:24:38] that was killing the prophets of old and
[1:24:40] you've got the same filthy seed inside
[1:24:41] of
[1:24:44] you he identified them he could identify
[1:24:47] them by the fruit by their fruits the
[1:24:51] proof came out of their own mouths the
[1:24:52] very actions proved who they were and
[1:24:54] the fruit showed their origin now notice
[1:24:57] when Cain K killed Abel Cain had no
[1:25:01] remorse he had no
[1:25:03] remorse okay he had why though he had no
[1:25:07] connection he had no connection you know
[1:25:09] me and my brother yeah we get along okay
[1:25:11] but we're not the closest but if I
[1:25:13] killed him I'd have remorse do you I
[1:25:15] mean but I you kill anyone got you know
[1:25:17] what I'm trying to say but he had Joy
[1:25:19] sorry um you know because he has no
[1:25:23] connection there's no they come from a
[1:25:25] totally different he has no remorse
[1:25:27] totally No Remorse you know they come
[1:25:30] from a different life
[1:25:31] Source totally different Life
[1:25:34] Source there was none of this invisible
[1:25:36] you know how we kind of love each other
[1:25:39] and one of us thinks of each other and
[1:25:42] you want to phone each other what can I
[1:25:46] say you know me and and get a phone call
[1:25:48] from brother I was thinking about
[1:25:49] brother Shay and he was thinking about
[1:25:51] me and then he I just I can't did I
[1:25:53] message you or you message me brother I
[1:25:54] can't remember I messag you you messag
[1:25:56] me you mean you just it's just an
[1:25:58] invisible Bond brother John you you get
[1:26:00] a message I was thinking about like mate
[1:26:02] I was thinking about you you it's just
[1:26:04] like brother John and brother brother
[1:26:05] Chad and brother everybody else you me
[1:26:07] it's just like what is it's an invisible
[1:26:09] Bond because you come from the same
[1:26:10] Source see what I mean but if you don't
[1:26:12] come from that same Source it's like
[1:26:15] you've got no remorse like Kane had no
[1:26:19] remorse and Judas and Jesus you know we
[1:26:23] and we see we see it today we see it
[1:26:24] today how can it be that that you know
[1:26:26] thankfully not here but you know you you
[1:26:28] get churches where socalled Brethren are
[1:26:31] kind of real nasty to someone how can
[1:26:34] that be I'm sure we've all experienced
[1:26:36] it how can that be how could it be well
[1:26:38] it's Judas and Jesus all over again it's
[1:26:41] Judas and Jesus all over again because
[1:26:43] they're coming from this different
[1:26:44] Source they don't have this compassion
[1:26:46] this empathy they don't have it because
[1:26:48] it's not their brother you know if if we
[1:26:51] see a homeless person on the street it's
[1:26:53] uh it's not nice it's not nice my heart
[1:26:55] goes oh oh Lord help him you know Lord
[1:26:57] help him but but if if I saw brother
[1:27:00] Brian laying on the street mate I'd stop
[1:27:02] the car jump out and I'd just do
[1:27:04] everything I can to help him what is it
[1:27:06] cuz we come from the same Source you
[1:27:08] know what I
[1:27:09] mean now it comes to fruits it always
[1:27:13] come back to fruits because and why is
[1:27:16] it always coming back to fruits because
[1:27:17] way back
[1:27:19] then it
[1:27:21] started there's a
[1:27:24] seed we're looking at the fruits now
[1:27:26] we're not looking at the seed anymore
[1:27:27] we're looking at the fruits so so
[1:27:29] looking at the fruits we're seeing where
[1:27:31] the seed came from now if you're like
[1:27:34] me give me a Farm Seed and I'm all right
[1:27:37] but if you give me any other seed and
[1:27:39] you say brother Simon there's a seed
[1:27:42] tell me what seed that is I'll say yeah
[1:27:45] no problem give me about 6 months in the
[1:27:47] greenhouse I'll tell
[1:27:49] you do you know what I mean it's true
[1:27:52] because when you don't have a clue what
[1:27:53] you're doing it's simple just plant the
[1:27:55] seed Let It Grow it's like oh yeah
[1:27:57] that's a tomato plant I know what that
[1:27:58] one is now do you me come
[1:28:01] on you know when it comes to the time of
[1:28:06] harvest we start to see what the seed
[1:28:10] was where it came
[1:28:12] from you
[1:28:14] know let's just look at the roots of
[1:28:16] these trees you know the roots of these
[1:28:20] trees that we see today manifest the
[1:28:22] trees that we see manifest they come
[1:28:24] from different Origins they're from
[1:28:25] different seeds and at the beginning
[1:28:27] they were not
[1:28:29] intertwined The Roots ain't
[1:28:31] intertwined okay they were totally
[1:28:34] separate and only through the fall did
[1:28:36] this false Vine gain the opportunity to
[1:28:39] grow together with the True Vine on
[1:28:43] Earth okay so the FR which brought the
[1:28:46] battle in heaven he brought the battle
[1:28:48] from that was in heaven onto Earth and
[1:28:51] it came to hold whole new level of
[1:28:53] battle you know we talk about like
[1:28:55] modern warfare and all the rest of it
[1:28:57] and but like a lot of it's like hiding
[1:28:59] out in it and you get these like sleeper
[1:29:00] cells and all the rest of it and what is
[1:29:02] it it's this disguise you get all these
[1:29:04] you get all these the Warfare is not
[1:29:06] kind of straight anymore you know you it
[1:29:09] used to be it's Christmas day now you
[1:29:11] know that's it put your guns down Lads
[1:29:13] and we'll have you know we'll pass
[1:29:14] presents to each other and that like it
[1:29:16] was in the Battle of s or whatever it
[1:29:17] was back then those days are over now
[1:29:19] it's like all hidden you don't know
[1:29:22] what's what and it's just all this
[1:29:23] blurred and since then you know in in
[1:29:26] the spiritual terms the trees have been
[1:29:28] growing together ever since and you know
[1:29:30] the wheat and the tears the tree of life
[1:29:32] and the tree of knowledge and you know
[1:29:35] they've been growing and growing now
[1:29:37] back in the days of Noah the the tree of
[1:29:39] knowledge got kind of trimmed back a
[1:29:41] little bit you know what I mean that
[1:29:43] tree got kind of chopped back a bit this
[1:29:46] funny I I would have liked to take a
[1:29:48] picture to show you but on the way just
[1:29:50] you know like this there piece of road
[1:29:52] in in in in in England we pass it all
[1:29:54] the time when we go shopping and they've
[1:29:56] got these poetries they're about yay big
[1:29:59] and I don't know why but like about 30
[1:30:02] foot high they've chopped them off
[1:30:04] straight right and the oddest looking
[1:30:07] things so you got a straight tree trunk
[1:30:09] that's like this big 30 foot tall and on
[1:30:12] the top you've got loads of these little
[1:30:14] trees growing out from the top but like
[1:30:17] like multiplied not one like like 15 and
[1:30:20] it's the oddest looking weird this thing
[1:30:23] and you just think you know when you
[1:30:25] chop something down usually it kind of
[1:30:27] grows back a b faster this time you know
[1:30:29] what I mean it's true yeah so back in
[1:30:32] the days of nor it got trimmed but uh it
[1:30:34] started growing again and it grew pretty
[1:30:37] quick you know you cut the apple trees
[1:30:40] back and they grow back stronger brother
[1:30:42] Hatfield would have been able to tell
[1:30:43] you all about that you see the seed from
[1:30:45] the the um the seed of the false Vine
[1:30:47] came through the ark although it had
[1:30:49] been cut back it was still there and it
[1:30:50] began now to grow again yes and in the
[1:30:54] days of Noah if you notice in the listen
[1:30:57] carefully in the days of Noah the the
[1:30:59] the false Vine was fully matured fully
[1:31:02] matured yeah and it was bearing fruit
[1:31:06] big time it was bearing the same fruit
[1:31:08] we see today let's read Matthew 24 and
[1:31:11] we'll see that Matthew
[1:31:13] 24 35 to39 Matthew 24 we just been in
[1:31:18] here aren't we Matthew 23 Matthew 24 4
[1:31:23] 35-39 he says Heaven and Earth shall
[1:31:25] pass away but my word shall not pass
[1:31:26] away but of that day and hour knoweth no
[1:31:28] man know not the angels of heaven but my
[1:31:29] father only but as in the days of Noah
[1:31:32] were so shall also the coming of the son
[1:31:35] of man be for as in the days that were
[1:31:38] before the flood they were eating
[1:31:39] drinking marrying and giving marriage
[1:31:41] until the day that Noah ENT the ark and
[1:31:42] knew not until the flood came and took
[1:31:44] them all away so also shall the coming
[1:31:45] of the son of man B so we see there very
[1:31:48] clearly that however it will be
[1:31:52] a millisecond before the Rapture was
[1:31:56] exactly how it was in the days of Noah
[1:31:58] amen see that tree of knowledge that
[1:32:01] that the false Vine was to such a point
[1:32:03] of
[1:32:04] maturity back
[1:32:08] then see and it's the same fruits of
[1:32:11] Satan that's being manifested and now if
[1:32:14] the fruit of the tree of life is all
[1:32:17] this peace Joy long suffering and so on
[1:32:18] for forth then the tree of the false
[1:32:21] Vine is going to be the exact opposite
[1:32:22] and that's what we see today that's
[1:32:24] exactly what we see today fruits of evil
[1:32:27] fruits of Lucifer and you know the last
[1:32:28] time I looked out my window it's pretty
[1:32:30] bad out there it's not so nice anymore
[1:32:32] you know we see the fruit of this false
[1:32:34] Vine we see as in the days of Noah we
[1:32:36] see the same thing
[1:32:37] today and now at the end time which is
[1:32:40] Matthew 24:24 Matthew
[1:32:42] 24:24 okay we see these Vines growing
[1:32:45] super close so Matthew 24:24 it says uh
[1:32:49] for the sh arise false christs false
[1:32:50] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:32:53] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:32:54] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:32:57] elect so now we see this false Vine
[1:33:01] remember it's the religious Vine it's
[1:33:02] the same one that started out back then
[1:33:04] the same one that started out back when
[1:33:06] it was worship and all the rest of it
[1:33:08] and all and all uh in heaven through
[1:33:10] Lucifer then it came down to earth it
[1:33:12] was in the Garden of Eden it was Cain
[1:33:13] and then Lucifer and the Pharisees and
[1:33:17] we see this it's it becomes so close now
[1:33:19] at the end that these branches are kind
[1:33:21] of
[1:33:22] blurry kind of blurry and you know if
[1:33:24] you've got if you've got uh like two
[1:33:28] trees and they kind of all like
[1:33:29] absolutely growing all mangled together
[1:33:32] have you do you do you have that game
[1:33:34] here like as children where you you
[1:33:35] follow the lines and you find out where
[1:33:37] it ends like a goes to you look for the
[1:33:39] little boat or the flag or some when
[1:33:41] you're a kid it's a bit like that so you
[1:33:43] you get all the trees all mangled and
[1:33:45] together and that simple grab a branch
[1:33:48] follow it all the way down to the roots
[1:33:51] and you'll find find what seed it came
[1:33:52] from which tree it's from but actually
[1:33:55] they get kind of blurred they're kind of
[1:33:56] together and they're so close that they
[1:33:58] kind of look the
[1:34:01] same and if it was possible it was
[1:34:04] listen carefully they shall show great
[1:34:07] signs and
[1:34:09] wonders we're talking about we're
[1:34:11] talking about
[1:34:13] Ministries that have got full on like
[1:34:16] healings and and and and big we're
[1:34:19] talking about when's that you know
[1:34:21] when's the last time you had like 50
[1:34:22] people down at the altar all from the
[1:34:24] world straight in doesn't happen we're
[1:34:27] talking about Ministries that have like
[1:34:29] coming to the Altar and giving the heart
[1:34:31] to
[1:34:32] somebody you know we've got we've got
[1:34:34] miracles happening we've got all these
[1:34:35] things going great signs and wonders it
[1:34:37] says that if it was possible it would
[1:34:39] deceive the very listen guys we are
[1:34:41] human right so if you've never seen me
[1:34:44] before and I come here and brother Chad
[1:34:45] says oh Simon I'd like you to me fine
[1:34:47] fine fine and then I at the end of the
[1:34:48] service anyone who sit come forward if I
[1:34:51] I just lay my hand on the head like
[1:34:53] that okay be a show a manly show and
[1:34:56] suddenly they're heal to walk out legs
[1:34:58] grow everything else it's all totally
[1:34:59] healed now that is totally accessible
[1:35:01] when you come and get pre but it's not a
[1:35:03] show right but if you make a show about
[1:35:05] it I'm telling you within a week I'll be
[1:35:07] invited everywhere true great signs and
[1:35:11] wonders but you guys you would look at
[1:35:13] it and you say whoa whoa whoa he's
[1:35:14] making a show that ain't the Lord see
[1:35:17] what I mean but you see it's so close
[1:35:19] now and it's this great signs and
[1:35:20] wonders it's get so close if it was
[1:35:24] possible it would deceive even the elect
[1:35:27] the vines you know look unless unless
[1:35:30] you've got the Lord living in you unless
[1:35:32] you've got that seed in you you will be
[1:35:35] deceived just read Mark 13 Mark 13 we're
[1:35:38] all over in the scripture which is fine
[1:35:40] Mark
[1:35:41] 13 verse 99-1
[1:35:45] please mark
[1:35:48] 13
[1:35:50] 9-1
[1:35:52] the Lord's
[1:35:55] good Mark 139 to1 okay says but take e
[1:35:59] to yourself for they shall deliver you
[1:36:01] up to the councils that's the false Vine
[1:36:04] trying to kill the the the True Vine
[1:36:05] yeah and remember deliver you up to the
[1:36:07] councils and synagogues this is church
[1:36:10] we're talking about this is religious
[1:36:13] not like oh they'll deliver you to the
[1:36:14] world and no no no no they'll deliver
[1:36:16] you to
[1:36:17] churches they shall take e yourself and
[1:36:19] they should deliver you up to councils
[1:36:20] and in Sy gogs you shall be beaten ye
[1:36:22] shall be brought before rulers and Kings
[1:36:23] for my sake for a testimony against them
[1:36:26] and the gospel must first be published
[1:36:27] in all all nations but when they shall
[1:36:29] lead you and deliver you I like this
[1:36:31] when they shall deliver you and Le
[1:36:33] deliver you up take no thought
[1:36:35] beforehand what you shall speak neither
[1:36:37] do premeditate whatever shall be given
[1:36:40] you in that hour that ye St speak ye for
[1:36:44] it's not ye that speak but the Holy
[1:36:46] Ghost which one's the holy
[1:36:48] ghost that one so
[1:36:51] in these situations
[1:36:53] right in these situations who speaks
[1:36:57] it's not you it's
[1:36:59] him
[1:37:02] so when you are cornered by the enemy in
[1:37:05] any situation and you don't know what to
[1:37:07] say and you pray Lord help me please
[1:37:11] Suddenly It's him in you that brings the
[1:37:14] answer and sometimes it's quite cool cuz
[1:37:16] sometimes we look back and it's like
[1:37:18] mate where did that come from it's true
[1:37:20] it happens to load of time just like oh
[1:37:22] man cuz I ain't that clever people think
[1:37:24] going to somebody stripped me down once
[1:37:26] I just kind of said what I said and I
[1:37:28] can't remember they they they were just
[1:37:30] so frustrated and like you've always
[1:37:32] been a good talker and stormed off and I
[1:37:35] just looked I thought yeah but I'm the
[1:37:36] one who actually can't talk I'm the one
[1:37:38] who just kind of fumbles and mumbles and
[1:37:40] kind of like just you know just have a
[1:37:42] go and just say it and wiggle your way
[1:37:43] out of it but you know sometimes it's
[1:37:45] like we're shocked it's we shouldn't be
[1:37:48] shocked it's so we're so stupid we're
[1:37:50] shocked because he speaks through us but
[1:37:52] he's just told us that he's going to
[1:37:54] speak through us but when it happens
[1:37:56] it's like M how how did that happen come
[1:37:59] on you know so when we're calling about
[1:38:01] the enemy it's him that's speaking and
[1:38:03] it's the same one that's in you the same
[1:38:05] one that's in you that's going to speak
[1:38:07] is the same one that can't be deceived
[1:38:10] so if it was possible we'd be deceived
[1:38:13] how is it not possible that we deceived
[1:38:15] because of that one that's going to
[1:38:17] speak out of you that same one stops you
[1:38:19] being deceived that same one
[1:38:22] discerns whoa that's the false Vine here
[1:38:25] now that's wrong amen you see they're so
[1:38:29] close that you can't hardly put a piece
[1:38:30] of paper between them yeah but if you
[1:38:34] give them now the word test yeah yeah
[1:38:37] amen give the word test and you'll see
[1:38:39] what's inside of
[1:38:41] them because the Holy Ghost Inside you
[1:38:44] cannot be de saved it can't be it can't
[1:38:47] be notice if it was possible but it's
[1:38:50] not we can't can't be deceived as long
[1:38:52] as he's inside you that is it it's like
[1:38:55] it's like it's like when you when he's
[1:38:56] sealed inside you that's it the box car
[1:38:58] has been sealed now if you want to know
[1:39:01] what's inside somebody just give him a
[1:39:03] squeeze stamp on brother John's uh foot
[1:39:06] I want brother but just stamp on his
[1:39:08] foot and he'll just say brother I know
[1:39:09] that you love me that's it that's it
[1:39:12] done see what I mean you stamp on
[1:39:14] someone else's foot and wait put it this
[1:39:15] way if you squeeze a lemon you're going
[1:39:17] to get lemon juice you know what I mean
[1:39:19] it's true is it just
[1:39:21] give them a squeeze I'm not telling you
[1:39:23] to go and squeeze every I'm just saying
[1:39:25] that if by their fruits you're going to
[1:39:28] know them buy their fruits you're going
[1:39:30] to know them we um we were down in New
[1:39:32] Zealand and there was this fruit tree
[1:39:34] outside and they looked it was full of
[1:39:36] oranges uh lemons what it lemons and I'm
[1:39:39] talking like hundreds of lemons it was
[1:39:41] huge right it's like well nobody's
[1:39:44] touching them cuz the lemons and the
[1:39:46] person out the it was an Airbnb they
[1:39:47] said oh yeah go for it mate take him we
[1:39:50] like okay well Miriam might have one she
[1:39:52] likes a bit of lemon so sweets do you
[1:39:54] know they were like oranges they were
[1:39:56] like oranges so what sort of lemon it
[1:39:58] was I've got no idea it's true a it they
[1:40:00] were super sweet they're super sweet
[1:40:02] they were like oranges but they were
[1:40:04] like a lemon so sometimes you can't
[1:40:06] always look on the outside and see well
[1:40:08] that's a lemon that's going to be
[1:40:09] sometimes you know I might look at
[1:40:10] brother Joe and say may you look pretty
[1:40:12] sour bro and then you talk to him and
[1:40:14] he's as sweet as honey you mean but you
[1:40:17] can't always go by the outside you know
[1:40:19] so by your fruit what is the fruit it's
[1:40:21] not just what it looks like it's what's
[1:40:23] inside the fruit and if you notice
[1:40:25] inside the fruit there is a seed and
[1:40:28] that seed is an exact multiplication of
[1:40:31] the DNA seed of what was planted in the
[1:40:33] tree and go back until you get to where
[1:40:36] the Jo has been she was hiding there hid
[1:40:39] in Christ from before the it's true hid
[1:40:42] in Christ before the foundation of the
[1:40:44] world okay says just given the word test
[1:40:47] and you know the Lord Jesus was he was
[1:40:49] the Rose of Sharon he didn't look like
[1:40:52] it beaten smashed down hung on the cross
[1:40:56] but he was squeezed and out of him came
[1:40:59] that perfume of the rosesan he was the
[1:41:01] lily of the valley he got squeezed and
[1:41:04] the same perfume that came out of the
[1:41:06] Lord is the same perfume that comes out
[1:41:08] of the Bride when she gets squeezed it's
[1:41:10] exactly the same notice the Lord said in
[1:41:13] John we won't read it John 10:27 he said
[1:41:16] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[1:41:20] and they follow
[1:41:22] me
[1:41:23] listen the Lord says my sheep hear my
[1:41:26] voice they know my voice he said his
[1:41:29] voice is also his word yes and so when
[1:41:32] you hear the word if there's something
[1:41:35] that's a little bit off you can hear it
[1:41:37] and you're like whoa whoa whoa because
[1:41:38] my sheep know my voice so as long as
[1:41:40] we're bringing it here and it's the word
[1:41:42] of God that we're bringing it's like M
[1:41:43] that's so true that's brilliant that's
[1:41:46] so true because my sheep need know my
[1:41:49] voice so if we give someone somebody
[1:41:51] word test if they're his sheep they will
[1:41:53] know the sound of the word they will
[1:41:55] know it and they'll say Amen there'll be
[1:41:57] a deep down on the inside that's going
[1:41:58] to respond to them thank you for getting
[1:42:01] me the brook brother Franco let's lean
[1:42:03] not to thine understanding he's
[1:42:06] 1965 you know brother was talking about
[1:42:09] the cattle being brought down he says
[1:42:11] the cat laugh the cat laughed their kind
[1:42:12] many time in bringing a round up down
[1:42:15] now this is something that we we haven't
[1:42:17] got cattle now we used to have fairish
[1:42:19] cattle but not now um
[1:42:21] this is like different for you American
[1:42:23] guys cuz this is talking about like the
[1:42:25] thousands he says we bring down whole
[1:42:27] herds of cattle and the little Cales and
[1:42:29] I used to wonder how they would ever
[1:42:31] know their own Mama now they coming down
[1:42:34] out the mountains the cattle all mixed
[1:42:36] together and a cow is with a cal maybe a
[1:42:38] little hungry Cal might nurse from a
[1:42:40] little from another mother if he's real
[1:42:42] hungry but when we stop them out on the
[1:42:44] Prairie and the mama starts through that
[1:42:46] crowd of cows uh until she finds her own
[1:42:49] the calf is running for its mother it
[1:42:51] knows that certain wine in her ball
[1:42:54] she's balling for the calf and other
[1:42:56] mothers are balling till you can't even
[1:42:57] hear yourself think but the little L the
[1:42:59] little calf will find that certain call
[1:43:02] of its mother because it's a part of its
[1:43:05] mother a born again Christian from
[1:43:07] Heaven he's a part of this word right
[1:43:09] another mama he will not follow his part
[1:43:11] of the word and he stays with the word
[1:43:15] listen we've seen ourself with the
[1:43:17] cattle and with the Sheep you know it's
[1:43:19] like when you're sorting them out you've
[1:43:20] got you've got loads of there there's
[1:43:22] the hundreds of them kicking around and
[1:43:25] it gets loud it gets so loud honestly
[1:43:28] you can't hear yourself think you can't
[1:43:30] even scream at each other to talk and
[1:43:32] yet in amongst all that it's crazy how
[1:43:35] the Lambs and the even the Sheep they
[1:43:37] find the way straight to the m how's it
[1:43:39] happen I don't know but they know the
[1:43:42] sound of the mother and we know the
[1:43:45] sound of our father his voice his word
[1:43:48] we always will find our way back to our
[1:43:51] father wherever you are he's calling for
[1:43:53] us remember um no man ever searched
[1:43:56] looking for God God's calling man he's
[1:43:58] that one who's I say balling you know
[1:44:00] what I mean he's the one who's shouting
[1:44:01] out to us come on Brian come on do you
[1:44:03] know what I mean he's calling to us and
[1:44:05] we hear him you know when when we were
[1:44:07] kids you might think I'm a bit crust but
[1:44:08] but I used to just whistle for our
[1:44:10] kids like I Whistle them they knew I
[1:44:14] tell you I'm telling you there' be a
[1:44:15] crowd like with the homeschooling thing
[1:44:16] whatever hundreds of kids I go I can't
[1:44:19] even whistle cuz I'm I'm I'm mouthe gone
[1:44:22] dry I give a real loud whistle I tell
[1:44:24] you out of the whole crap our kids would
[1:44:25] come straight to me it sounds like like
[1:44:28] like a bit you know a bit unfather mate
[1:44:31] it's not it's just a way of calling your
[1:44:32] kids them knowing you know I don't
[1:44:34] whistle for them on a night o i just
[1:44:37] shout
[1:44:39] but but Jer they knew that sound they
[1:44:43] knew that above all and you know what we
[1:44:46] know the sound of Our Lord amen and
[1:44:49] sometimes he doesn't wish whistle
[1:44:51] sometimes it's just a still small voice
[1:44:54] but we go straight to him we know that
[1:44:57] voice the bride knows the sound of his
[1:44:59] voice she knows the sound of his word
[1:45:02] and somehow it's called Grace somehow we
[1:45:05] follow that sound until we get to where
[1:45:08] we're supposed to be am Before the
[1:45:11] Throne of God the Lord is good you know
[1:45:14] the two on the road to EMAs they were
[1:45:16] walking together and the lord gave them
[1:45:19] the word the whole time he was giving
[1:45:20] them the word all day long and when they
[1:45:22] heard it something kind of was burning
[1:45:24] on the inside it's like man something
[1:45:27] there's something here you know and and
[1:45:29] the two the two SE the the two the two
[1:45:32] uh the deep and the the Deep calling to
[1:45:34] the deep and the Lord Jesus and the two
[1:45:35] and something in him and and and come
[1:45:38] time for him to dis oh no no Lord please
[1:45:40] stay stay stay they they they stopped
[1:45:41] they didn't want there's something an
[1:45:42] unseen Bond exact opposite of what Cain
[1:45:45] had to his brother there's this bond
[1:45:47] that it's just like m i don't you know
[1:45:49] when we kind of said goodbye to brother
[1:45:50] John I kind of cried you know what I'm
[1:45:52] saying you know because because there's
[1:45:53] a bond there's a bond it's not seen you
[1:45:56] can put a piece of paper between us but
[1:45:58] but when we say goodbye to to to one
[1:46:00] another there's this unseen bond that we
[1:46:02] just love each other we appreciate each
[1:46:05] other it's that deep go and they felt
[1:46:07] that on the road to the em and the word
[1:46:09] came to the word there walking on the
[1:46:11] road to and this came this
[1:46:14] reaction you
[1:46:17] know the seed that was in them
[1:46:21] okay came from the Tree of Life that was
[1:46:26] walking and talking with them the seed
[1:46:29] that was in them came from the third man
[1:46:32] walking the tree of life and it can only
[1:46:36] be a reaction when that happens you know
[1:46:39] the fruit of the True Vine let's look at
[1:46:41] the fruit of the True Vine you know
[1:46:43] we're in the world and the worlds are
[1:46:44] Fallen condition we can see the false
[1:46:46] Vine you know the false Vine is is
[1:46:48] showing off its fruit everywhere it's
[1:46:50] absolutely everywhere you know we can't
[1:46:52] escape it but as the two Vines have come
[1:46:56] to maturity the True Vine is also
[1:46:59] bearing fruit it's not just the false
[1:47:01] Vine the TR the True Vine Al those small
[1:47:05] listen you know I was going to draw a
[1:47:06] little a little graph but it's like
[1:47:10] could do I suppose I could do I could do
[1:47:13] um so I'm just going to move it this way
[1:47:15] this is just this is just Simon but I
[1:47:17] like I like to just think about this if
[1:47:18] we have a graph and we have uh power
[1:47:21] displayed power displayed notice it's
[1:47:24] Tower Power displayed okay it's going up
[1:47:27] here okay and that's the Max and that's
[1:47:29] the zero and then here we have time
[1:47:33] again time okay and time is going this
[1:47:36] way so this is Eden here here is
[1:47:39] Eden Eden and here is like now okay this
[1:47:42] is now this is 2024 2024 I like doing
[1:47:44] these little graphs but the point is the
[1:47:46] power displayed back in the Garden of
[1:47:48] Eden right listen carefully one man one
[1:47:52] man Mountain over there tree move you're
[1:47:56] going to be called this you're going to
[1:47:57] be called that full full power full
[1:48:02] Dominion so the power displayed of Adam
[1:48:05] Starts Here Right power displayed in one
[1:48:10] man now then how much power was
[1:48:13] displayed in Lucifer in the Garden of
[1:48:15] Eden one word one word so the power
[1:48:19] displayed starts down here but as time
[1:48:21] goes on the power displayed has gone up
[1:48:24] there for Satan Lucifer this is Lucifer
[1:48:27] remember it's power displayed not power
[1:48:30] actual power and the power displayed of
[1:48:33] God and God's children has come to the
[1:48:35] point now like this notice we are such a
[1:48:40] small
[1:48:41] minority we even though the church is
[1:48:44] full of the power it's not a show we
[1:48:46] have got such a small minority right and
[1:48:49] yet Satan is now in the majority and his
[1:48:52] power is being displayed in the
[1:48:55] world you
[1:48:58] see we listen you know we think oh it's
[1:49:02] it's all gone
[1:49:03] wrong it's not cuz it looks like we're
[1:49:07] going down in power you've missed the
[1:49:10] point we're going back to Eden we're not
[1:49:14] we're not coming down the bride ain't
[1:49:15] coming down the bride's going back up
[1:49:17] we're going back to Eden we're going
[1:49:19] back to to that full power you know the
[1:49:22] world the world looks and thinks oh
[1:49:23] Christians will look at them they're
[1:49:25] just a a tiny bunch of of nobodies yeah
[1:49:27] yeah it looks like it power power
[1:49:30] displayed power shown we're going back
[1:49:32] to be Eden we're going back up to that
[1:49:35] position and Satan sorry mate you're
[1:49:37] going back down to Zero from zero from
[1:49:39] hero to zero and we're going from the
[1:49:40] zero to the hero yeah yeah yeah sure you
[1:49:43] know the bride is now
[1:49:47] displaying although it's not a show for
[1:49:49] the world she's this listen the Lord
[1:49:51] Jesus the greatest power that ever lived
[1:49:54] and how did he display it beaten whipped
[1:49:58] hung on the cross and died amen how is
[1:50:00] it going to be for the bride the
[1:50:02] greatest power you'll be beaten by your
[1:50:05] brother beaten by your sister I'm just
[1:50:07] saying you know what I mean or you'll be
[1:50:08] beaten by the world you'll be beaten
[1:50:10] knocked down and in the eyes of the Lord
[1:50:11] that's the most beautiful thing ever and
[1:50:13] as that rules of Sharon bride is crushed
[1:50:15] the perfume Rises to heaven and that is
[1:50:18] a sweet Savor in the smell of God the
[1:50:20] True Vine is bearing its fruit in
[1:50:23] you and when you hear this word preached
[1:50:26] just like the two on the road to maze
[1:50:27] you say didn't our hearts burn as we sat
[1:50:30] and listen today wasn't Lord good didn't
[1:50:33] he speak to us and that's because the
[1:50:34] Original Seed that's in you is
[1:50:37] responding to the seed of the word
[1:50:38] that's coming over and there and it can
[1:50:41] only be a reaction it can only be you
[1:50:44] you get nervous oh Lord you know how am
[1:50:47] I going to say anything how am I going
[1:50:48] to do this how I'm going to do it's like
[1:50:49] you know what just leave it brother
[1:50:50] brother car said I think brother Lonnie
[1:50:51] said just just wheel the barrel out to
[1:50:52] the front and that's it that's your job
[1:50:54] done how should we why should we worry
[1:50:56] we know that the word's going to
[1:50:57] encourage somebody somewhere just just
[1:51:00] give it out that's the word it's the
[1:51:02] original word it's going out the two the
[1:51:05] two the two uh Powers coming together
[1:51:08] and there has to be this reaction the
[1:51:10] original word that's in you is
[1:51:12] responding we are bearing the fruit the
[1:51:14] Lord is manifesting his life in us just
[1:51:17] read James 5 James 5 7 to8 7 and 8 James
[1:51:22] 5 7 and
[1:51:25] 8 the Lord's
[1:51:30] good I'll just blow my
[1:51:34] nose James 5 7 and 8 says be patient
[1:51:39] therefore Brethren unto the coming of
[1:51:41] the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth
[1:51:45] for the precious fruit of the earth and
[1:51:49] hath long patience for it until he
[1:51:51] received the early in the latter rain be
[1:51:54] ye also patient establish your hearts
[1:51:57] for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh
[1:52:00] notice here the husbandman the Lord
[1:52:04] Jesus he's waiting for this precious
[1:52:07] fruit of the earth now you know these
[1:52:09] the trees have been the seeds have been
[1:52:11] sewn the trees have grown and now the
[1:52:13] fruits are shown and the Lord is waiting
[1:52:15] for this precious fruit of the earth and
[1:52:19] what fruits waiting for he's waiting for
[1:52:20] you amen he's waiting for the bride the
[1:52:23] bride is that fruit to come to maturity
[1:52:26] and listen seeds don't bear fruit that's
[1:52:29] right so when you first came to the Lord
[1:52:31] wherever we were in our life we loved
[1:52:33] the Lord something inside we couldn't
[1:52:34] help it but like abble Cain all the rest
[1:52:36] we couldn't help it we just loved the
[1:52:38] Lord but we weren't kind of bearing the
[1:52:40] fruit cuz we were still a seed it
[1:52:43] doesn't make us any less but we're still
[1:52:44] a seed but now this bride tree is so
[1:52:47] mature it's bearing exactly the same
[1:52:49] same fruit that he
[1:52:51] did see let's read in Paradox uh
[1:52:55] paradox paradox just read Paradox in 64
[1:52:58] it's actually the piece right before
[1:52:59] that what we've read
[1:53:01] already it says and today this age we're
[1:53:03] living in there is a bride tree no he's
[1:53:06] not a seed there's a bride tree coming
[1:53:08] forth see truly the tree has come up and
[1:53:11] they soon as they organized they
[1:53:12] couldn't step any father what happens
[1:53:15] they organize go out on this limb then
[1:53:17] that limb is pruned according to St John
[1:53:19] chapter talk about when it's you know
[1:53:21] through the church ages according to St
[1:53:23] John the 15th chapter he prunes them off
[1:53:25] and they never used no more but in the
[1:53:28] heart of that tree comes forth the fruit
[1:53:32] right in the top of it when the tree is
[1:53:35] fully matured that's now it can't go no
[1:53:39] further right in the top the last Church
[1:53:41] AG is here she's come into full mature
[1:53:44] it's a bride tree
[1:53:47] amen see the bride is is this precious
[1:53:50] fruit of the Earth the fruit that is
[1:53:53] Manifest in the Life of Christ the fruit
[1:53:56] is I just want to read a spoken word The
[1:53:58] Original Seed I think brother Chad read
[1:54:00] this as well whenever he preached on the
[1:54:04] uh whatever it was I listen to it on the
[1:54:06] way over here and um some sometimes
[1:54:09] sometimes you you kind of you kind of
[1:54:10] see something it's like you know the
[1:54:12] bride is that tree of life the bride is
[1:54:15] the tree of life and you're kind of
[1:54:17] doing your notes and you know that you
[1:54:19] know it's com from the
[1:54:20] you know it's coming from the Lord if
[1:54:21] Minister you'll know it you know it
[1:54:22] brother Kyle you know it comes from the
[1:54:23] Lord but sometimes it's just too
[1:54:25] unbelievable it's too scary and and and
[1:54:28] I kind of left it out and and I thought

[1:56:25] that original tree it's the Lord ofy
[1:56:28] production it has to be look my forehead
[1:56:33] if you know the Abbot family you'll say
[1:56:34] he's an Abbot look he's even got the

[1:56:54] reproduction it's it's it's Christ The
[1:56:57] Mystery of God revealed in
[1:56:59] you the mystery of God revealed in you
[1:57:02] just like we've read in James 5 the
[1:57:05] coming of the Lord is drawing nigh and
[1:57:07] that means it's kind of harvest time it
[1:57:09] means the stuff's got to be getting ripe
[1:57:11] the precious fruit is going to be taken
[1:57:13] into the Ghana it's coming to the point
[1:57:15] where it's it's getting ripe now har
[1:57:19] time means kind of Separation it's true
[1:57:23] it's a separation of the two Vines it's
[1:57:25] this culmination of this whole plan the
[1:57:27] tears and the thistles will be separated
[1:57:29] out to be burned and the Harvest Time
[1:57:31] means separation it separates the bride
[1:57:34] takes that grain from the bride away
[1:57:36] from the field that she's been raised in
[1:57:39] she's been raised in this world the
[1:57:41] world this Fallen world that's where
[1:57:42] we've been raised that's where we have
[1:57:43] to grow in there and we'll be taken away
[1:57:45] but for those who are left behind it's
[1:57:47] also a separation time it's separation
[1:57:50] from Grace it's separation the the
[1:57:53] harvest time the Rapture is separation
[1:57:54] all sides total separation it's
[1:57:57] Separation The Lord's coming soon you
[1:57:59] know and there a scripture says Luke
[1:58:01] Luke 3:9 we can read it actually Luke
[1:58:04] 3:9 Luke
[1:58:07] 3:9 Luke 3:9
[1:58:11] remember no let's read this now also the
[1:58:14] axe is laid unto the root of the trees
[1:58:17] every tree therefore which bringeth
[1:58:19] forth not good fruit is heun down and
[1:58:22] cast Into the
[1:58:23] Fire notice that the ax is laid to the
[1:58:27] root of the
[1:58:29] tree which root you talking
[1:58:32] about whereabouts on this little diagram
[1:58:35] are we the root of the tree that's a
[1:58:38] seed that's a tree I tell you what it's
[1:58:41] it's quite close in there it's going to
[1:58:43] be laid to the heart of Lucifer that ax
[1:58:46] is going to be separated those two those
[1:58:48] two Vines if they don't bring forth the
[1:58:50] good fruit it's going straight back to
[1:58:52] the root of the tree the Root's pretty
[1:58:54] close to the seed amen you know it's
[1:58:57] kind of the root it's kind of where the
[1:58:59] tree comes from right and the Lord's
[1:59:01] going to deal that death blow amen it's
[1:59:04] coming that
[1:59:05] time you know the act of God's judgment
[1:59:09] is laid to the root of trees and if it
[1:59:12] doesn't bring forth the fruit of the
[1:59:14] original tree it's going to be he thrown
[1:59:15] into the fire because a seed has to
[1:59:18] bring forth after it kind and if it's a
[1:59:20] seed from the father that's what it's
[1:59:21] going to be producing byy your fruits
[1:59:23] you know them it's it's God's law of
[1:59:25] reproduction you know and and the ax is
[1:59:28] it's the axe laying time it's the
[1:59:29] Harvest Time you know everything that's
[1:59:32] not seed of the original is going to be
[1:59:34] separated everything you know brother
[1:59:36] John he's combining with his maze he
[1:59:38] sent me a film of it it was beautiful
[1:59:40] the Lord's good I'm I'm the you know
[1:59:42] everybody everybody you have contact
[1:59:44] with they always put the Lord straight
[1:59:45] into everything you know he's H mind and
[1:59:46] he's like oh the Lord is good brother
[1:59:48] and he's enjoy it's just give thanks the
[1:59:49] Lord but you know brother John's combine
[1:59:51] he just swapped it out this when we were
[1:59:53] here last time he just swapped his
[1:59:54] combine if if he's
[1:59:55] combine starts to separate out the
[1:59:58] Shooks and a few tassels and all the
[1:59:59] rest and sticks it into the OR into the
[2:00:01] hopper you're going to get a new combine
[2:00:04] you're going to sort it out it's it's a
[2:00:06] separation of anything that's not the
[2:00:08] seed that you want to be in the hopper
[2:00:11] which you're going to take home and put
[2:00:13] into that Heavenly Kingdom which would
[2:00:15] be that round tank that he's got back at
[2:00:16] the farm you know what I mean anything
[2:00:18] that's not fit for the cows for the
[2:00:20] king's table as it were he going to be
[2:00:23] separated out it's natural types of
[2:00:26] spiritual you know now question is when
[2:00:29] brother when brother John goes to
[2:00:31] Harvest his his his crop what's being
[2:00:34] Harvest ah it's maze well yes but it's
[2:00:38] actually
[2:00:39] fruit because the fruit is the Harvest
[2:00:43] of whatever you're planting it's not
[2:00:45] fruit it's not just like tomatoes or
[2:00:46] whatever it is it's the fruit of the
[2:00:48] Harvest is the grain so if it's maze
[2:00:50] it's maze that's the fruit of the
[2:00:52] Harvest yeah and and and I'm telling you
[2:00:55] the Lord is not harvesting maze here the
[2:00:58] Lord's harvesting the fruit the precious
[2:01:00] fruit you are the Harvest you are the
[2:01:04] one that's going to be taken you're
[2:01:05] going to be separated for everything
[2:01:06] else you're the fruit of the Bride tree
[2:01:10] you are the fruit of the you are the
[2:01:11] fruit of the tree of
[2:01:13] life you know the bride is bearing that
[2:01:17] fruit she's bearing his fruit it's his
[2:01:20] roots and it's his fruits this is I
[2:01:22] think this is this is the quote I was
[2:01:23] talking about Christ is the mystery of
[2:01:25] God revealed
[2:01:26] 1963 I love that it says now
[2:01:29] remember he is that tree of life
[2:01:33] contrary to the serpent seed you see
[2:01:35] he's that seed the woman's seed the Tree
[2:01:37] of Life In The Garden unless they put
[2:01:39] forth their hands and move this tree
[2:01:40] they'd eat of the tree and live forever
[2:01:42] right so the Lord bringing that again
[2:01:44] we've read it already if if if if the
[2:01:47] way wasn't guarded to that tree of life
[2:01:49] even if you sin you suddenly eat of the
[2:01:50] tree of life it's beautiful for us
[2:01:52] doesn't matter what we are and what
[2:01:53] we've been you eat of the tree of life
[2:01:54] and you've got life okay and he's the
[2:01:57] only tree that can be taken that you can
[2:01:59] live forever his word is life and that
[2:02:02] be the word then the word of God which
[2:02:05] Eve turned down in the Garden of Eden
[2:02:07] then here is Christ the word made
[2:02:08] manifest and when he come on Earth he
[2:02:11] was the Tree of Life do you believe that
[2:02:14] congregation says amen and Rome what did
[2:02:16] they do he had to be chopped down
[2:02:19] a bit like those po trees I told you
[2:02:20] about one trunk chopped off and it's the
[2:02:25] weirdest thing that's like 20 come out
[2:02:27] the top see what I mean they might have
[2:02:30] chopped him down but look what came out
[2:02:31] the bride Look what comes out he had to
[2:02:34] be chopped down and he was put on a tree
[2:02:35] of dis disgrace cursed is the is he that
[2:02:38] HTH on the tree become a curse for the
[2:02:40] human race and now through that he
[2:02:42] brings forth a bride tree yes which will
[2:02:46] be the Tree of Life life restored back
[2:02:51] to him as husband and wife in The Garden
[2:02:53] of e all glory to God by the same word
[2:02:56] and the same God made manifest in
[2:02:58] husband and wife the same brid tree back
[2:03:02] again you know those those uh 15 little
[2:03:05] Twigs that grow on top of them thing
[2:03:08] they're actually all the same
[2:03:10] tree you chop it off and it grows Noah
[2:03:14] it came through the flood the sin the
[2:03:16] sin that was after the flood that
[2:03:18] chopped It Off it grew back all those 15
[2:03:20] sin as well and what was it it was the
[2:03:23] same seed it was the same tree but we
[2:03:26] we're seeing now it's the same tree
[2:03:27] that's restored back now and it's not
[2:03:29] some ugly looking tree it's the most
[2:03:31] beautiful thing you've ever
[2:03:32] seen but you see he's bringing forth a
[2:03:35] Bright Tree which as he said which will
[2:03:38] be the Tree of
[2:03:41] Life mate it's a fully matured tree it's
[2:03:45] bearing his fruits it's manifesting him
[2:03:48] in every single
[2:03:50] way and the tree comes from the seed
[2:03:53] that was way back there at the beginning
[2:03:56] before anything was manifested John 1 in
[2:03:58] the beginning not Genesis 1 in the John
[2:04:00] 1 in the beginning
[2:04:02] beginning right when it was still just
[2:04:05] the word when everything was just there
[2:04:08] and nothing was yet manifest as it were
[2:04:10] we were chosen in him before the
[2:04:11] foundation of world to bear this fruit
[2:04:14] it's amazing now we're in 2024 and it's
[2:04:18] time when these two trees are fully
[2:04:20] manifesting now their
[2:04:24] fruits his plan his plan for you and me
[2:04:29] is to bring us to such a maturity that
[2:04:32] we are him we become him we you know the
[2:04:38] exact same seed that was in the
[2:04:39] beginning now in a multiplied form the
[2:04:43] bride's coming now to such a maturity
[2:04:45] that the world now by looking at you can
[2:04:49] actually see him think about it the
[2:04:52] world wants to know what the Lord Jesus
[2:04:53] looked like I'm looking at it I'm
[2:04:56] looking at it yeah yeah but you know
[2:04:58] you're not the prettiest bunch of people
[2:04:59] neither was a
[2:05:01] lord there was no Beauty in him that men
[2:05:03] should desire him you know there's none
[2:05:04] of us that are super beautiful no on the
[2:05:08] inside we're the most beautiful thing
[2:05:09] the Lord ever created the Lord is good
[2:05:12] you know we are coming to such a
[2:05:15] maturity that the bride is manifesting
[2:05:17] him in every way Brother Kyle I think
[2:05:20] preached on Ecclesiastes 3 and there's a
[2:05:23] time for everything it lists everything
[2:05:25] there's a time and a season for this for
[2:05:27] that there's a season I'm telling you
[2:05:29] there's also a time in a season for the
[2:05:31] bride to manifest his fruit there's a
[2:05:34] time there's a time for the bride to
[2:05:36] show the world what was in the original
[2:05:39] seed there's a time and that is the time
[2:05:42] we are the chosen people to show the
[2:05:44] world we're the chosen people to
[2:05:46] manifest Christ and you know we come to
[2:05:50] a
[2:05:51] close and uh I don't know how long we've
[2:05:55] been I don't I don't want to know but
[2:05:57] it's okay I had to get rid of loads of
[2:05:59] notes cuz I just thought oh Lord but all
[2:06:02] is well let's just as we come to a close
[2:06:04] let's read Luke
[2:06:05] 24 Luke chapter
[2:06:09] 24 Luke chapter 24 I'm coming to a close
[2:06:11] but not quite
[2:06:13] yet we'll get there Luke chapter 24 let
[2:06:16] me blow one no
[2:06:17] again
[2:06:22] and we'll read 44 and
[2:06:26] 45 Luke chapter 24 44-
[2:06:34] 45 so and he said unto
[2:06:38] them these are the word this is when
[2:06:40] he's after he's resurrected he comes to
[2:06:41] see them come to see his disciples and
[2:06:44] he said unto them these are the words
[2:06:46] which I spake unto you while I was yet
[2:06:48] with you that all things must be
[2:06:51] fulfilled which were written in the law
[2:06:52] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[2:06:55] Psalms concerning
[2:06:57] me then opened he their understanding
[2:07:01] that they might understand the
[2:07:04] scriptures
[2:07:06] listen the Lord opened their eyes of
[2:07:09] understanding the Lord opened their eyes
[2:07:12] even though he'd walked with them for
[2:07:13] years before years he'd been explaining
[2:07:17] to them and expl it's a bit like it's a
[2:07:19] bit like you know dipping the soap same
[2:07:20] thing there comes a time when he opens
[2:07:22] their eyes of understanding he'd walk
[2:07:24] with them for years but there was a
[2:07:26] specific time when their eyes were to be
[2:07:29] opened unto what he was talking about
[2:07:31] he'd already taught the scriptures but
[2:07:33] the Revelation was only given later
[2:07:36] on it was given at the right time listen
[2:07:39] in 1963 the seals were
[2:07:42] broke yeah the seals were loosed but
[2:07:46] there was a specific time when the
[2:07:47] revelation of what it was all about was
[2:07:49] to
[2:07:50] come you know it was the Revelation was
[2:07:53] to be given later on I want to show you
[2:07:56] this little this I'll draw you a little
[2:07:57] diagram here I'm getting used to this I
[2:08:00] know I could never have one back home
[2:08:01] sorry brother
[2:08:06] Michael listen I've got to copy this one
[2:08:09] to show you so it's like I love drawing
[2:08:11] these little graph time okay so it's
[2:08:14] like it's like a it's like a a a little
[2:08:16] graph and here we have
[2:08:19] uh rapturing Revelation rap I'm saying
[2:08:21] rapturing Revelation and not just
[2:08:23] Revelation okay rapturing
[2:08:26] Revel okay and now here we have levels
[2:08:30] so this is zero that's one two 3 all the
[2:08:33] way up and this is maximum is like
[2:08:36] 100% cuz that's that's your maximum
[2:08:39] that's that's that's the Rapture okay
[2:08:40] now here is time again we have time
[2:08:43] usually we have time at the bottom so
[2:08:44] it's time and here we have first church
[2:08:47] age second second Church age and so on
[2:08:50] so forth so first church age yeah
[2:08:54] okay and now we have this kind of growth
[2:08:57] we have these steps brother brother uh
[2:08:59] John sings that song you know this uh
[2:09:02] seven steps and that's it yeah so now
[2:09:05] here we have this is the bride and she's
[2:09:08] kind of walking up these
[2:09:11] steps the Revelation is growing so as
[2:09:15] we're as we're going through these
[2:09:16] Church ages this this this Revelation is
[2:09:19] growing
[2:09:21] revation is growing it's growing we
[2:09:24] can't help it we we can't help it what
[2:09:26] is it's the tree that tree that's
[2:09:28] growing in us the seed is becoming more
[2:09:30] and more mature and now we get to a
[2:09:32] point here and here we have
[2:09:37] 1963 we have
[2:09:40] 1963 and now here we have this is the
[2:09:44] rapture
[2:09:46] Rapture this one
[2:09:49] so now we know at the point of the
[2:09:51] Rapture this Revelation level has to be
[2:09:55] here it has to be here
[2:09:59] okay but we are right now and I'm just
[2:10:03] you know we're looking for the Lord's
[2:10:04] coming every day we know that but we're
[2:10:06] saying that we're here right now this is
[2:10:08] us us it's not the US I'm sorry it's
[2:10:12] just
[2:10:14] us this is now so we see this kind of
[2:10:18] time period look here here it's been
[2:10:21] this time
[2:10:22] period you
[2:10:25] know seals were broken back then nobody
[2:10:29] really knew what it was on about true
[2:10:31] it's true let's be honest see he opens
[2:10:35] the eyes of
[2:10:38] understanding at a specific point in
[2:10:41] time when the Lord was walking with him
[2:10:44] he was preaching the word to him the
[2:10:46] whole time he was the word
[2:10:48] and yet they didn't have a clue what he
[2:10:50] was talking about although something on
[2:10:52] the inside was
[2:10:53] burning but they didn't even know what
[2:10:55] it was but it was just it was just like
[2:10:57] that deep calling to deep I don't
[2:10:58] understand it but I just believe it Lord
[2:10:59] but there's a specific time when his
[2:11:02] when they opened their eyes amen it's
[2:11:06] beautiful and you know Revelation is
[2:11:09] given it can only be given we know the
[2:11:11] scripture Simon blessed out th Simon
[2:11:12] Jonah not this to but the Father which
[2:11:15] is heaven Revelation is only given amen
[2:11:18] can't be
[2:11:19] learned see and the Rapture the
[2:11:23] revelation of actually who we are and
[2:11:26] what it's all about has come kind of
[2:11:29] nowish am you know it's only now that
[2:11:32] we're truly seeing who we are mate I'm
[2:11:34] telling you the first time that I
[2:11:35] because I mean when we when the Lord
[2:11:37] brought us out from where we came from
[2:11:38] and and the Lord began the ministry it
[2:11:40] was on the back of who we are because I
[2:11:42] could kind of see who we are I was kind
[2:11:45] of getting wo hang about how can we be
[2:11:48] the Bride of if we're him the word says
[2:11:50] that the two shall no longer be Twain
[2:11:52] but one therefore that makes us kind to
[2:11:55] him that's what brother was saying back
[2:11:56] there but no one ever dared to say it
[2:11:58] because you being a man make your s God
[2:12:00] they crucified the Lord Jesus for saying
[2:12:02] that they would have crucified the bride
[2:12:03] for doing that as well and if and if the
[2:12:05] Lord does not come there'll be no flesh
[2:12:06] saved why because the false fire will
[2:12:08] crucify the bride for saying that you
[2:12:10] are God that's who we are that's where
[2:12:13] we are and the Revelation only just come
[2:12:14] now it's only just come now why mate
[2:12:18] this is the last days of the last days
[2:12:21] we are in the last I tell you we are so
[2:12:24] close musicians can you come
[2:12:27] please listen one of these
[2:12:31] days the bride is going to be
[2:12:33] gone I'm not the best artist I know but
[2:12:37] I'm just going to put here the Rapture
[2:12:38] for the bride is this this takeoff it's
[2:12:42] like one of those kitty little rockets
[2:12:44] look the Flames pouring out the bottom
[2:12:47] and there's sister Joys
[2:12:50] inside it's
[2:12:52] true one of these days we're going to be
[2:12:57] gone and now listen when they send up a
[2:13:01] rocket the last thing they put in is a
[2:13:04] rocket
[2:13:05] fuel the last thing the most volatile
[2:13:09] Revelation is put in at the last
[2:13:14] moment because if the devil knows
[2:13:17] catches this Revelation he could do
[2:13:19] great damage like brother Ram says we're
[2:13:21] right at the end this is the hour this
[2:13:24] is the season we're in this is where we
[2:13:26] are we have to be ready it says keep
[2:13:29] your lamps all trimmed and burning for
[2:13:32] the bridegroom watch and wait it's
[2:13:34] manifesting time it's lamp trimming time
[2:13:36] we're in that time it's a time when the
[2:13:39] TR the battle is Raging more than ever
[2:13:41] between the two
[2:13:43] trees you know we may be in a mixed up
[2:13:46] body but but the seed that's in us
[2:13:49] that's the real you and me it ain't M
[2:13:52] mix
[2:13:53] tree we only carry the the real me the
[2:13:57] real you carries the Original Seed
[2:14:00] listen it's home time yeah you know I
[2:14:04] hated school I hated school I had a bad
[2:14:07] up bad childhood I hated school and you
[2:14:10] know the most favorite words that I
[2:14:12] heard as a
[2:14:14] child 20 to 4 okay children it's home
[2:14:18] time
[2:14:19] yes that was my favorite
[2:14:22] words and that's what the Lord's saying
[2:14:24] to his children the Lord is gently
[2:14:26] calling us now because it is home time
[2:14:29] it's time to be gone it's why this
[2:14:32] sudden burst of Revelation this the
[2:14:34] rocky fuel that listen we can't ignore
[2:14:36] it and each one of us in here knows it
[2:14:39] especially the older ones that have been
[2:14:40] around a long time you've never heard
[2:14:42] things that you've been hearing the last
[2:14:44] 5 years or so never never although it's
[2:14:47] been there the whole time but there's a
[2:14:50] time when the eyes of the opening of the
[2:14:52] understanding has to be opened it's
[2:14:54] right at the last time the rocket fuel
[2:14:56] soon we're going to be gone am soon
[2:14:59] we'll hear the Lord say it's home time
[2:15:02] children it's home time yeah amen we
[2:15:05] sing 1051 please be it unto me according
[2:15:09] to Thy word you know we want the Lord to
