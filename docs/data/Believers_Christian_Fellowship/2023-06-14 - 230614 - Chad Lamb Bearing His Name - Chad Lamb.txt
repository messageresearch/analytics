we had a wonderful trip but it feels good to be back amen I always feel good when I get back to see everybody once again and know that all is well and then what we're standing let's go and take our Bibles and turn to Acts chapter 9. I bring greetings from Brother Eugene Braun from the church there and all the saints there's so many of them wanted me to say hello to so many of you but uh we want to just receive their greetings and I want to Bear those greetings for them and we had a wonderful time we had weekend meetings there there was a Saturday morning men's fellowship breakfast which was wonderful whether Dale Smith was there and he shared at that and then we had the Saturday evening and Sunday morning serviced and a Sunday evening Fellowship we just had a marvelous time it was good to see everybody it's been almost four years since I've been there because of covert restrictions and all kinds of different things with the Border but oh it was good to see everybody's doing really well amen they're doing wonderful the word was good the fellowship was excellent the atmosphere was outstanding and God is good amen through it all everybody's still pressing on Amen everybody had challenges they had challenges we've had challenges over the last three and a half to four years but God brought us through them all and the word continues to bring us forward and so it was good to go see and hear their testimonies amen God is good also I enjoyed the service brother Nathaniel priest I had a chance to finish it last night as I was traveling home and I enjoyed that and appreciate him coming and doing that for us and also very much enjoyed the special the young men say that was wonderful I appreciate their lives I appreciate their dedication and love for the Lord and it comes through as they sang and it did me a whole world of good to hear them sing I've listened to it maybe five or six times already and I couldn't get enough of it amen don't say God bless you I also understand brother Aaron has some family in God bless you you're very very welcome and we're glad that you're able to come and visit amen let's look in here at Acts chapter 9 now Acts chapter 9 verse 15. Acts chapter 9 verse 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my namesake amen God bless you as you take your seats we begin to look into his word amen I've got a PowerPoint brother Frank if you could bring up that PowerPoint for me that would be great so we want to look at this scripture we want to talk about bearing his name this evening I was encouraged by Brother Nathaniel's message because it was right in line with where my heart was and some things I ministered up there on Sunday that I also wanted to share here today so I love to watch the continuity and it's always good and it's encouraging but we'll talk about bearing his name for just a little bit and and here in the book of Acts we know that Saul before he was the Apostle Paul he was Saul he was a great persecutor of the Christian faith and he was hauling men and women into prison and persecuting them and he was on his road to Damascus and he was struck down by the pillar of fire we know the story well and God comes to ananias and he wants him to go speak to Paul in ananias is hesitant he has a resistance because he knows the reputation of Paul but what ananias doesn't know is what God knows is that before the foundation of the world that he had already designated Saul to be Paul and to bear his name and so he says go thy way for he is a chosen vessel and to me don't worry about what you see don't worry about your reasoning don't worry about all your fears because in the back part of my mind he was a chosen vessel from before the foundation of the world but he was chosen to do something he was chosen he was a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel for I will show him how great things excuse me he must suffer from my name's sake so he was chosen to bear his name I want to look at this for just a minute the word bear here means to take Upon take up in order to carry or bear to put up upon oneself something to be carried so God had actually chosen Paul to carry his name to the Gentiles Amen in this word name here means the name is used for everything which the name covers so everything which the name covers everything the thought or feeling of which is aroused in the mind of mentioning by mentioning hearing remembering the name for one's for example one's rank their Authority their interest their pleasure command Excellence Deeds when you say name this name encompasses everything about that person everything the name brings to mind amen are understanding amen somebody's name a name is more than characters it may be spelled out with characters but a name is more than characters amen the Apostle Paul was not commissioned and chosen to carry a spelling a proper spelling that's not what he was that wasn't what he was commissioned to carry so it's more than characters that of an alphabet that make up a name it's also more than pronunciation right he wasn't Paul wasn't commissioned to carry the right Aramaic characters so that the Gentiles are Greek characters or whatever it would be translated into they would know the name of Jesus Christ and they would have the right pronunciation amen that's not what he was carrying but he was carrying his name which that name is everything that the name represents which it represents the person of Jesus Christ himself when he was bearing the name he was literally carrying the presence of Jesus Christ the person of Christ and he was bearing the name to the people and everything that name represents he was carrying it to the people amen so it's more than just like I said characters or pronunciation this is why we have a whole world of billions of people that believe they're calling on the name of the Lord and they're calling on his history they're calling on characters they're calling on pronunciation amen but they don't know the person and they're not getting the effect out of the words amen that they would like to have amen because they don't have the character of Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ all that they have is a name that somebody told them but that name is so much more than a historical name of a historical figure amen that name represents a person represents a living person who's alive today that name represents all of his character his rank who he is and all about him and all that he's accomplished and all of his characteristics are wrapped up in that name praise God so so that is what the Apostle Paul is commissioned to carry to Bear to take upon himself and carry to the Gentiles we see this in the Old Testament here in Jeremiah 7 he refers to this he says but go ye now into the place which was in Shiloh where I set where I set my name at the first and see what I did to it for the wickedness of My People Israel he said go to Shiloh Shiloh was where the Tabernacle was first set up when they crossed Jordan and he says so when they first set up the Tabernacle he said go to Shiloh and see the place where I set my name at first what does he mean by set his name did he have a plaque with spelling and words and characters that's not what he meant by said his name that's where he put his presence that's where he could be found that's where he placed himself amen where they could contact him was in Shiloh that's where the Tabernacle was it wasn't that he had a nameplate and he put that nameplate there and he drove it in the ground and said his name there no he plays this is where they came to know God and contact God this is the place where he placed his name and this word set means to settle down abide dwelled Tabernacle or reside so where he said his name is where his name dwelt where his name tabernacled and it was in Shiloh amen what was in Shiloh the Tabernacle amen and God was dwelling in that Tabernacle and when God was in that time and I go all that God represented was there it was represented there all of his characteristics his nature his word it was all there and he says when when he had when he had come to that place he set his name there so the name I hope we understand now so much more than alphabetical characters so much more than pronunciation amen if we go to pronounce Jesus's name it depends on what country you're in is he Jesus or Yeshua or Jesus or can I say can I say Yeshua can I say Jesus can I say Jesus and get the same results if I'm talking about the same person so it's like what I say his name is not exactly the way it sounds when somebody else calls on the name of the Lord somebody from the other side of the world when they call on the name of the Lord what strikes my ears will be much different than what I say when I call in the name of the Lord but if they have his name amen and all that his name encompasses they're calling on the name of the Lord it'll bring the results amen this word name in the in the Hebrew is Shem it means reputation fame or Glory so much more than characters it represents the person it's their character it's their reputation it's their Glory it's all that they are is wrapped up in their name so when God places his name somewhere he puts his whole reputation his Fame his glory his person he attaches it to that and so now the Apostle Paul is carrying that name to the Gentiles in Acts 15 14 says Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name so now God's coming to the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name now what does that mean he's going to have a people that are going to bear his name amen a people that are going to have his name amen not not a pronunciation not not a spelling but they're going to have the very nature character they're going to have Christ amen and they're going to carry his name in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14 says for this cause I bow my knees into the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named if you remember when brother Isaiah Brooks was here he mentioned this scripture he went to this and this struck my heart back then and I've been meditating it on that since he said that he says the whole family in Heaven and Earth Bears the name his name Jesus Christ amen and that name is not just something that tickles your ears amen but that name is the the person and and it it brings with it a character characteristics character of a person is attributed to that and if the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ amen the whole family in Heaven and Earth must bear the same character of that name because listen you know it's there's more to a name when you say when you say somebody has a good name what does it mean to have a good name does it mean well you know I I like I like this name better than that name this one has a just a nice ring to it the way it comes rolls that's not what it means to have a good name but we all know what it means to have a good name is to have a good reputation to have a good character and you're you're well thought of that means to have a good name because your name represents your person so now if you can also ruin your name is that right you're going to have a good name but you can also ruin your name and how can you ruin your name amen because you can act in a bad character and act in a bad way in doing so you ruin your name but the characters of your name never changed the pronunciation never changed but you can either have a good name or you can have a bad name depending on your conduct so this name means so much more than letters and syllables and pronunciations so if the whole heavens and earth is named Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was the very manifestation of God himself and when he took on human flesh and he was he was a very reflection of the invisible God with all the characteristics and the character likewise and all the whole family is named Jesus Christ they all come under this name amen and if we're going to bear that name we're going to have to bear that character those characteristics amen because now I I had an uncle one time he was actually my great uncle amen but he was of a certain age because my grandpa had a large family where his sons were actually my age they were my second cousins my dad's first cousins but they were closer to my age and he passed away and I remember at his funeral he had I think it was five boys if I remember right and and at his funeral they kept talking about their their dad would tell them when they would go out at night when they got of age they got 16-17 to go out with friends and he said he would make this statement to him he says make sure you represent the family name well and all of those boys all of those boys talked about how that that little saying haunted them when they were out with their friends why because they were bearing his name they were his children they were bearing his name amen and they were bearing the family name and their conduct had a reflection on the family name and he said bear the name bear the family name well amen and then and it's amazing how much impact that had on them but it had a lot of impact on me when I heard that and we realized amen that that our children amen they have a reflection on our name they bear our name the wife Bears the name of her husband and she has a reflection on the character of the husband amen so the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ and they must come under what that name represents what does it represent it represents a character it represents a life it represents a glory of Fame a reputation and so here we're here on Earth and we're bearing a name but that name that we're bearing is the name Jesus Christ and that name represents characteristics it represents a life and if I'm going to bear that name and have that name attributed to me and come under that family name amen then I must come under the characteristics of that name or else I can I can misrepresent the family name brother said in the God of this evil age but he is calling not a church group but a people for his name that receives his name engaged in his name going to a wedding to be married to him to be part become part of him see by predestination just as a man that chooses a right wife in life was ordained to be part of his body so that is the bride of Christ will be in his now from old ordained by God to be part of that body and to bear his name because it's his body what's the name of his body Jesus Christ I'm part of that body and that body's under the headship which is one name so he's looking for a people for his name that receives his name so what does it mean to receive his name is to receive him and all of his life and character in the Philadelphia churches it says he says Jesus said I come in my father's name and you receive me not therefore the name of God is Jesus for that is the name he is coming he is Lord Jesus Christ and and what name does a woman take when she marries the man she takes his name it will be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her unto himself so her name will be Mrs Jesus Christ amen but she's going to now by marriage be carrying that name and how is she going to carry that name how are we going to carry that name are we going to carry it in such a way to misrepresent the character that that name represents I said God help us help us Lord Jesus if we're going to carry your name and if you're so gracious Amen to unite with us and place your name on us amen may we surrender ourselves so that your life can live out your characteristics in us so that we don't bring a bad name to your name we don't misrepresent your name we don't take your name falsely because we say I'm part of that family in Heaven and Earth that's named Jesus but I have a totally different character how can you have a totally different character and be part of that family say oh God we need you amen remember says in this message once more he says why did he change Jacob to Israel not until you wrestled with the Lord not until he overcome and when Jesus overcome death Hell In The Grave the Bible said he had a new name and when Jacob overcome and if the church can overcome so let's listen to this if the church can overcome what does the church have to overcome here's what he says she will stop saying I'm Methodist Baptist Presbyterian when she can overcome her Creeds and the world that's drawing her in there she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ Mrs Jesus Christ what do you have to overcome you have to overcome the whole denominational thinking in the whole carnal system and thinking about God and the whole worldly set up we've got to over Heck on that and when we can overcome that we won't call ourselves by a false name we overcome that we won't be methodists and we won't be Baptist and we won't be Presbyterian but maybe it goes a little deeper than that we won't be part of this message group and part of this message group and identified with this Minister and part of this church no I I that's not what I'm bearing I'm not just bearing the name of all I'm bearing one name and that's the name of Jesus Christ and I'm not going to get my identification with Methodist Baptist or this Doctrine or this group or this special this and this special church here but I want to Bear one name and that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen that way that we know that we're overcoming because we're overcoming and we're not taking false identities but we're coming to one identity and that's Mrs Jesus Christ President says in the name is in the word not just because Jesus is spelled out in the Bible somewhere but the name is in the word because he is the word so when you're reading the word you're reading Jesus Christ because it's his characters it's his life it's his reputation it's his glory it is him it's his characteristics so when you're reading your Bible you're reading Jesus Christ even in the places that j-e-s-u-s isn't spelled in your English Bible you're still reading Jesus Christ now listen and the name is in the word because he is the word what is he then the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God I thought it was Jesus Christ it is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word made manifest in the day and age that we live in so the word interpreted is a manifestation or a revealing of the name of God why do we have to have the name of God revealed we've known it for two thousand years we may know a pronunciation we mean no characters amen but we do we know what those characters rep do we know the life behind it the character behind it so there must in every age be a manifestation of the name of God well we've known that we've known that since Jesus Christ was born we've known that that name no there must be a fresh manifestation of the name and the age you live in amen so no wonder flesh and blood is not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am amen what was the Revelation who he is not just who he was not just who he will be but the Revelation that the church is founded upon is who he is in every day in every age the the manifestation or the the the the the thing the the foundation of the church the rock that the church is founded upon that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it is one foundation and that is the revelation of who he is and that is the manifestation in the name of God amen it goes on in God's chosen place of worship he said there is fine people in the world fine churches but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for that's where his name Lays amen now we're all the way back like we were in the Old Testament all the way back the place where I set my name now what what is Mrs Jesus Christ that's where his name lays there is where his worship is in her and her alone that is true just like he said oh my just like he said in Jeremiah he said go back to Shiloh the place where I set my name and look at it because of their wickedness I brought destruction go look at where it's at now and I tell you go back and look at where the Lutheran Church is and where the Wesley church is it's an absolute apostasy it's disgraceful where they're at why because that's where his name was at one point but when they left Christ amen they're no longer bearing his name that's where he had said his name absolutely in that day amen but that's not where his name is now amen so where is his name wherever Mrs Jesus Christ is that's where his name Lays it's not a plaque it's not a button it's not a name tag it's his very character his life that she is carrying the wife can ruin the husband's name in fact if you marry the wrong kind of woman you will ruin your name your name will be mud your name will be smeared amen because because your wife is a reflection of your character brother Bennett said the kind of woman a man chooses reflects his character and what's on the inside and what he's thinking about his future oh amen he preaches this in choosing of a bride amen so a man's wife reflects what's on the inside of the man and that's why you marry the wrong kind of woman amen and she goes out there and she will ruin your name but if you marry the right kind of woman she will she will actually bring glory and honor to your name when she keeps herself in humility and modesty and reverence and respect and her reputation is good and clean and pure she will actually bring glory to your name because she's the right kind of woman that's the kind of woman the Bride of Jesus Christ should be we should be bringing glory to his name because the woman is the glory of the man according to what Paul said the woman is the glory of the man amen but but a bad woman the Bible says is as water in your blood it weakens you amen but the right kind of woman brings glory to his name so where does his name lay today wherever you can find this is Jesus Christ where the word for this day is being interpreted as a manifestation of the name what's the interpretation of the word for this day Jesus Christ in the formation of his bride he's here living his life in his body and his body is a mini-membered body upon this Earth which is the Bride of Jesus Christ United to the head which is he himself living his life through his body that is the interpretation of the word today and that's where his name Lays oh God I want to represent that name right but I'm not going to be able to do it by myself the only way for me to represent that name is for me to forget my name remember what your name represents your name represents your character your reputation your Fame Your Glory it represents all that you are all that you've accomplished your rank in life your status and everything that goes with that name but in order to bear his name I'm going to have to lose my name which I'm going to have to lose my reputation I'm gonna have to lose my rank I'm going to have to lose everything every everybody thought about me and become absolutely nothing so that I'm not bearing my own name my own Glory my own reputation but I'm bearing his name I I I just can't do both at the same time so may God help me a man in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet of God says and remember we are now as his bride pregnanted with his Spirit oh my the church bearing Children See pregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name we are now bearing his name we're carrying his name and his name is on display through the bride we're bearing his name what does it mean bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminence is evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but Alive forevermore that's what the bride's doing she's bearing his name she's bearing his life amen now now I want to I want to take just a turn that was all just Foundation amen you know when when we say that we must bear his name we go all the way back to Genesis if we go all the way back to Genesis you don't have to turn there but I'm going to reference two scriptures and in Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 it says this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man and the likeness of God made him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created what what name was the woman bearing Adam she was bearing his name why because she was carrying his life his Spirit the female part of his Spirit part of his flesh she was bearing his name and her name was never Eve until after she committed adultery and God never gave her her name Adam gave her a name God gave her the name Adam he didn't give her a separate name or a separate identity he only intended for the two to be one and have one identity one identification and one name and that name was Adam she was not to separate from Adam and have her own thoughts her own ideas so when she's separated brother Ben said when she left the word she left her mate and when she left the word she committed adultery amen because now she had her own desire her own lust her own want something she wanted something that she saw that this was good for food to make one wise now there's a reputation involved now there's self-desire and self-reputation and all of this self-promotion amen because the the serpent says in the day you eat there if you'll become like God's knowing good from Evil and now there's a whole reputation coming in and now she left the word she left her mate amen and now after she falls and after the curse comes upon him then Adam Amen in Genesis chapter 3 Adam called the name of his wife Eve which is the mother of all living how did she get to be the mother of a living by adultery by leaving the word by seeking her own reputation her own passion her own lust her own desire that's how you get Baptist that's how you get methodists that's how you get Catholic leaving the mate leaving the word to have her own promotion our own ideas our own glory and our own reputation amen and we think those are just names of denominations listen it can be your church name in the message it can be your family name it can be under your favorite preacher or pastor's name oh God help us not to seek our own identification our own reputation our own our own Glory our own Fame but oh my that Pride was injected at the fall amen it comes from Lucifer through Satan injected into Humanity amen through the serpent and now we find it in Cain and oh my goodness God Almighty help us to fight that thing [Music] because the moment we start making our own reputation amen we're going away from our mate we're going away we're being tempted away we're not here to have our own name amen I'm not here to have a good name on this planet I'm here to Bear a good name one name and that's the name Lord Jesus Christ amen oh praise God if we can keep our mind in the right frame of mind then we can begin to understand the Temptations of the devil as it comes in and these little Temptations they come so subtle they come so subtle and sometimes they seem so good amen and we're tempted to do things to make ourselves look better than someone else I mean it doesn't come in as a bold face it's just a subtle playing with that Pride that's buried in your old conquerber nature playing with that desire amen that desire to be just a little more well thought of telling you we all suffer from it every one of us suffer from it we've got to watch that thing amen and say that's not why I'm on this planet that's not why I'm here I'm not here to make a name for myself I'm here to Bear a name and if God will help me that's what I intend to do amen but I can't do it on my own now I want to look at what we call the statue of a perfect man from second Peter chapter one begin in verse 4. whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises promises promises we have to see this as part of promises if we don't see this as part of promises we'll see us as a works and merit-based program that I have to work my way from Faith to Virtue I've got it's not a Works based program these are promises given us this exceeding great and precious promises that by these by what by the promises you might be partakers of the divine nature how am I going to be a Perfecter partaker of the Divine Nature by the precious promises having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience into patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness into brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so these Seven Virtues that we're looking at capped off by charity perfect love amen it's the divine nature but we've received precious promises that we might be partakers of the divine nature so this is a promise to me amen then I want to receive the promise brother Brandon in the message things that are to be he says this now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God and there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God I love that statement because when brother Venom says you're nothing but usually when you use that you're nothing but a this or that you use it it's been used so many times derogatory but when he looks at you and says you're nothing but he's about to say the most wonderful thing that could ever be said about you you're nothing in this life you're nothing your reputation doesn't matter you're you're all your glory doesn't count you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the Son of God then I can say I'm nothing but the only thing I ever want to be that is that is the most marvelous statement I've ever heard amen attributed to me you're nothing but praise God I don't want to be nothing but that that's the only thing I desire to be is a manifestation of God as a son of God then he goes on to say now now you're expressed after his word has come into in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people in this neighborhood where you associate you're nothing you're nothing but the manifestation of a gene of life that was in God as the son of God and now you're expressed after his word is coming to you and you're expressed to light up this age and you're now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty why am I here what's my purpose he's about to tell you this is your purpose your duty is to express God to this nation and this people in this neighborhood where you associate we are not here to make a name for ourselves we are not here to gain a reputation we are not here to have a good name amen we are here to express God where everywhere I'm at is where I'm to express God amen I'm not here to gain accolades I'm not here to collect Awards I'm not here amen listen if they come to my funeral and they start preaching my funeral start talking about all the things that I achieved in this world Amen and that that's all that there's ever said that my life will have been the most wasted life there ever was on the earth he won a Nobel Prize and he invented this and and he he won the the the marathon and he he was first place in the high school or whatever who cares it all Burns and it all perishes amen who cares at the end of my life you can read a whole list of achievements and accolades and awards and it will mean absolutely nothing to me I want to get into the place where that doesn't mean anything but what means something to me is that I die so that he can live so that I can do what my duty is and my duty is to express him and if God wants that the expression to come through accolades and through Awards and through promotion amen then that's got to be up to him it's not my achievement it's got to be his achievement if he wants to move me to another position into another place or he wants to it's got to be his achievement in me not my achievement for myself but his achievement for himself amen when God needs us in a position he'll put us in that position if he can get more glory in another position he'll move us to that position the problem is when we think we earn that position because of our hard work and our dedication and our wisdom and our amen then all of a sudden Pride enters in amen and then a haughty spirit and that's all precursors to a fall we didn't get listen we didn't get to the positions we're in because we're brilliant we didn't get to the positions we're in because of all of our Hardware yeah do you work hard yes I do I work hard because whatever God's given me to do I want to do my best I don't want to be found slothful if God's given me a job I work is unto the Lord amen but we've got to keep our mind in the right spot or else we find ourselves caught in a trap then we end up missing our very purpose and we miss the purpose for our promotion because our promotion is for God to put us in another place so that we can express him we miss the purpose for a job change because that was God moving us because our duty is to express him in this neighborhood and this church and this place where you associate so if God moves your Association it's because your duty is to express him in that new Association maybe God's done with having you express on the shop floor maybe he wants you to express in the executive boardroom what am I doing from here to there I'm there to express God I was there to express God I'm here to express God that's my duty on this planet praise be to God amen oh praise God so let's go to the next version First Peter 4 12. beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you now now this is really the part that I really wanted to get to all of that was just laying a foundation so that I can speak for the next 10 or 15 minutes on this thought we've made this statement before but I want to make it here in connection with what we're talking about the virtues that we talk about the divine nature Amen to express God if we express God we will Express a god according to his divine nature if we're going to Bear the name of Jesus Christ we're going to Bear a certain nature and we've already been told this is the divine nature of these virtues but the virtues are only expressed in opposition to those virtues we spoke of this before faith is only expressed in an atmosphere of unbelief if everybody's believing there's no expression of faith but when everybody's disbelieving and some will believe now there's an expression of faith Faith Rises to the occasion in the face of unbelief amen Temperance when nobody has self-control Temperance now comes in and is self-control in the face of conditions where you would lack self-control knowledge where there is no knowledge of God God gives knowledge now these virtues aren't yours these are his that he's granted to you it's Holy Ghost virtue Holy Ghost Temperance Holy Ghost not this isn't yours this is his amen but how are these expressed they're expressing the opposition to the virtue so if we never have opposition to The Virtue how will the virtue ever be expressed remember he told us that the whole purpose for the fall is because white stands out against a black backdrop through the contrast brings the Revelation the contrast makes the nature of God stand up and so we can complain about being as Satan's Eden but I'm telling you we've had the best backdrop we've ever had to display the Life of Christ amen you can say oh Satan's in this got me down Satan's even is not to get you down sanezine is not to destroy you laodicea is not to hinder you it's there to create a situation where the light of the Gospel can shine brighter than it's ever shine in any generation because it's blacker than it's ever been so we can grieve and mourn and the government this and I wish we could get it back it's not meant to get it back you're not meant to make America great again that's not what's supposed to happen Satan Zina is supposed to go into full effect so the virtues can be displayed and the faith nobody has self-control except the Bride of Jesus Christ nobody has Temperance except the Bride of Jesus Christ the whole world is good they're losing out to their own desires they're losing out their their victims to their own Passions no more virtue no more strength in the human race amen they're totally given over to their passions their wants their desires until they've become absolute fools chasing after desire and they're ruining lives all over the place there's in everyone else amen but it's the perfect situation for the divine nature to go on display amen I'm so glad to be alive in this day amen there was a day when when when America was Christian amen there was a time then it was under the Puritans and it was mostly holy and mostly right and my goodness my poor little flame would have been so lost in all that life but oh praise God it's so dark that even if I've got a faint flame it's going to shine bright in this day I'm so thankful he put me in this day amen so that if I can surrender to him and his life his word can lighten me it'll shine like it's never shine before amen so we can look at these things and take the wrong mindset oh woe is me oh it's horrible it's perfect friends perfect for what he wants so the virtue the virtue it the opposition to The Virtue is necessary to display the virtue and then also you begin to wonder where do these virtues come from amen they're activated by the Holy Ghost but they come from the seed of God and God knows what's trapped inside of us and he knows to how to draw it out amen God knows how to activate the virtue amen he's placed a seed inside of us and he's quickened that seed by his word and he knows how to bring that seed in the full manifestation and sometimes it takes a little pressure sometimes it takes a little trial a little tribulation a little pressure to get that virtue activated and on display so then the trial doesn't become something terrible the trial becomes something wonderful because it's going to produce in me more of the divine nature on display not less more amen praise God in the Samaritan Church age out of the church age book I'm going to read this quote to you he said why does he stand by the reason is Romans 8 17 and 18 and if children then heirs heirs have gone and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US not to us in US so the sufferings of this present time are not even comparison not worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering characters of Victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule you know I'm just gonna stop reading for a minute just speaking for myself I for so long I I I want so much the power of Christ to be displayed in my life I want to see manifestations and works and and want to see all of these things and and you know we've seen we've seen so many things that God has done we've seen him heal in some Supernatural ways we've seen him do Supernatural things all over our lives and we chase after sometimes that manifestation but really that manifestation without character it becomes satanic so then now my main goal is not to chase after the power but now my main desire is to chase after the character because if I chase after the character the power won't harm me the power won't destroy me the manifestation won't won't cause me to fall you understand what I'm saying so now my desire is not for power my desires for character oh God Amen God do a work in Me God help me help me to die help me to overcome and Lord display yourself in this vessel Lord I'm surrendering oh now you come and live with me I need more of you but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's term then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation I love how he said the little temporary sufferings I've been in some of those little temporary sufferings and I thought I was going to die I thought it was the worst thing that ever happened I can't even catch my breath I think I'm going to die if God if you take me home now that would be fine by me but brother van calls him little temporary sufferings they're not even worthy to be compared to the glory that lays ahead amen and then he goes on the court of scripture thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are detrium this is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering is that strange that he wants us to be like him why because we're called to bear his name so he must have his character so is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened his sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it isn't of God Hebrews 12 6 for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth but if ye be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then you are bastards and not Sons now this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no True Believer free from it amen this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffers long and is kind oh my you say why all the pressure why and and you know we've talked about this before but my expectation is not for the outside pressure to get better my expectation is not for the world and it's darkness and its encroachment upon amen everything we stand for I don't expect that to get better why because the darkness shines forth the light the pressure brings more virtue Amen Brother Bear said sometimes God has to crush a rose to get the perfume out of it you know and the crushing of the Rose the intent was not to destroy the rose or throw away the rose it was the intent of crushing the rose was to get a fragrance out of it that would that would fulfill the purpose of the Rose and take the rose into another life now instead of a rose by the side of the trail or by the side of the road who only gets smelled by somebody who bends down and smells it when that Rose is collected and crushed the fragrance now can become part of a fragrance that fills the house that anoints a person that becomes part of the apocry that's burnt amen Before the Throne of God now what God is trying to do is trying to get that sweet saver on display not to destroy sometimes it feels like we're being destroyed when God is never destroying us amen he is always trying to get what's inside of us to come out of us his light his nature his virtue his characteristics sometimes it literally sometimes it feels like God's trying to kill us I don't know if you've ever felt that way but I felt that way I felt like God is literally destroying me but then I look back and say that's the best thing that ever happened to me the outer man needed to be crushed needed to be destroyed that was my handicap that but what was God trying to do not destroy me he was trying to bring something out of me that would overcome the situation when God allowed a child to come and hit job God knew what was in job gone God wasn't trying to destroy job but God knew what laid inside of job and he knew that job was a genuine believer in a son and he knew that the trial amen would not destroy job but job's Faith would go on display and that's what happened in the trial that job's Faith went on display but God as always is accomplishing multiple things in one trial he's not ever just accomplishing one thing he's accomplishing multiple things and you can see in Job that he's doing multiple things and Joe excuse me and job I wrote this down he's accomplishing these two things I take note of he's probably doing way more than two but just two that I want to make note of he was manifesting the faith that was in job God knew it was there he knew that he could he could throw job in front of the devil and Satan comes before God and he says have you considered my servant job there is none like him in all the Earth why would God do such a thing like that is because he knew what was in job even if job had doubts God was endowing if job may have been unsure God was sure and God wasn't there to destroy job God was there to do things he was there to manifest a son of God but job also had a fear and he said that was great I greatly feared his come upon me and job also had a question and what was job's question Joe's question was what happens to a man after he dies I see the tree come back I see the plant happened but what happens to the man all his children gather around they look at his grave What Becomes of a man so job has a question and and in one dark period of job's life God brings the manifestation of the faith of a Son of God to the Forefront and despite of all of opposition he doesn't lose his faith but then God also makes job come face to face with what he feared most losing everything losing his health losing his becoming poor moving into poverty losing reputation job lost everything that a human could lose lost his health and lost his relationship with his wife lost his children lost his reputation in community lost all of his wealth but he never lost his faith what was more valuable all those things are Faith and job God made job face his fear so that God could be the provider to overcome job's fear so many things happen to us amen and sometimes we have to face the very thing we fear we have to face losing reputation we have to face losing wealth sometimes we have to face whatever we have to face God will bring a child to allow us to face it so that that fear doesn't control us the rest of our lives so that we're not motivated and pushed around and controlled by that fear fear of never attaining fear of being rejected you know if you have a fear of rejection God is going to allow you to be rejected you say oh God how could you let this happen to me it's the best thing that ever happened to you because you've got to get over that fear of rejection so that that fear doesn't control you all of your life [Music] fear of not being accepted fear of not being good enough fear of losing something fear of never attaining something amen these trials that we go through they're for our perfection sometimes we'll have to face the very thing we fear we fear losing our family so the family will go through a horrible trial amen look at job had a question but all through the trial job received a revelation and that Revelation answered her question he said though the skin worms destroyed this flesh yet in my flesh I shall see and then once job passed through the darkness of the child God restored two-fold everything that job lost so now amen job had wealth and abundance he had abundance of wealth before but now he has double everything that he lost amen but now job has an abundance of wealth without the fear of losing the wealth praise be to God brother man says in the message I know he said and why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble puts bits in his mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God there had been no rainbow until the flood came but after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in a storm and the little Ark pitching up and down on the water it was after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for its first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise not before after that's the way you see the Promise after you've gone through the tribulation I've liked that poem or so must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of these While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas we asked for comfort and peace God gives us the best that he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace our comfort is just beyond the river most of you know because I've said it several times this is my favorite quote in all the message why is that brother Chad because it makes sense of my life amen I begin to realize that God is always for me he's always trying to bring me into my position and that my trials oh I'm going to say something here but just listen my trials are promotions God is trying to promote me in the Life of Christ amen the devil is trying to get me to take a demotion by taking self-love guarding my reputation getting me to follow Pleasures to have my desire amen that looks like the devil's trying to make you look like he's lifting you up but what he's doing is he's pushing you down because the Way Up Is Down so God will allow you to go down because it's his mechanism for promotion look at Moses Moses mother all his life told him you're a deliverer you're a deliverer you're a deliverer and he believed her you were born a proper child you were born under a sign you're a deliverer it's time for the prophecy to come fulfilled and you're the one and he believed it and he went out and in his own strength and his own Desire with all his own efforts amen he killed an Egyptian amen and then run into trouble with his own countrymen and he ran away amen and he ran away and became nothing he lost his reputation he lost his position he lost his power Prestige his money his good name he lost everything until he began to doubt whether he was even capable of being God so when God would come to him to put him in his commission amen God what was God doing God was trying to get him to fulfill the promise but he couldn't fulfill the promise and pride and arrogancy and self self self ability you know what I mean so God couldn't God couldn't use him in that condition to bring forth the promise of a deliverer God had to allow him to become nothing so that God could promote him into the office that Moses had Moses could never promote himself but the way up was down for Moses and God would take him from nothing and he would bring and and God I mean God did such a good job of Moses that when God come to tell Moses it's time and you're the one Moses says I can't do it I can't speak get somebody else you're making a mistake God so much so he argued with God until God was angry with him he had become nothing what was it it was his promotion God couldn't take him from where he was to deliver he had to take him from where he was and strip away all self from Moses and when he strip away self he could promote him this was God's promotion God help us to see our trials the right way we'll read the last part of this quote from the message I know he says it wasn't until the Hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials and they seen one like the Son of God standing among them their troubles produced the son of God their troubles produce the Son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave but not until they went into the fire did the comforter appear what are their troubles produced the son of God where amen where when things were good when they were held in respect when they had offices in the government that didn't produce the Son of God what produced the son of God a hard trial A desperate situation an impossible situation that they couldn't save themselves from but they held true to Faith they would not deny the word and when they would not deny the word under the squeeze and under the pressure It produced the son of God what they could not produce before was produced in the worst of times amen we should not fear troubles you know if we look at the life of Joseph we all know the life of Joseph really well but Joseph had a dream and in the dream he dreamed two dreams but they were both about the same thing and in the dream Joseph's mother and father and all his brother and bowed down to him he was exalted and they did obscence they bowed to him showing that he would have rulership over them and his brothers hated him for this dream because this dream was a prophecy and the prophecy showed Joseph that you're going to be exalted over your brethren and they're going to bow to you my goodness I'd love to receive a prophecy like that everybody's going to bounce you you're going to be the head over everybody my that sounds good I don't know what Joseph thought when he had that as a as a teenage boy amen but if he's a human being he must have thought wow this is going to be amazing and the truth is it is going to be amazing but it wasn't going to happen the way Joseph thought it was going to happen the path to the throne wasn't the path that he would have predicted so so God Amen used the prophecy to turn the hearts of his brothers against him so that they would hate him then when they begin to hate him they rejected him and then the rejection amen they sold him out amen they betrayed her brother and sold him into slave and in slavery he goes down into Egypt amen how is he ever going to exalt to the throne if he stays up in Palestine he's got to get to Egypt how's he going to get to Egypt the Way Up Is Down I we we read stories in the Bible and we're so good at reading stories but the prophet of God Has Come Along on our generation and he's made the stories real he made the people human he made the light he made the agony and the feeling and the heartache and the joy he made it tangible and can you imagine Joseph loved of his father amen now the sudden he's hated of his brother he didn't want his brothers to hate him he wanted to love his brothers he wanted the respect and admiration of his brothers he wanted to stay with his family and the love of his family and now they hate him now they despise him now they sell him now he's with a group of a million nights now he's on his way to Egypt he's a he's a teenage boy he doesn't know where he's going he doesn't know what's happening to him language is different Customs are different everything's different and now he finds himself in a slave market on the Block being auctioned off how would you feel would you feel like everything was going according to God's plan I'm I'm sure along this journey I may be wrong this is just me don't put any Credence on it but I just wonder if he ever said I thought God showed me I wonder if he ever had that thought Pat I thought I understood that dream I thought God showed me Elijah was a man of like passions like me and then you know things turn around a little bit and Potiphar's house he gets a little bit of privilege a little bit of authority things are going okay and then another deception in another round of Lies moving not just in slavery now now he goes to prison from hated rejection to slavery to bondage in Egypt now from bondage in Egypt now by more deception and more lies and more rejection what was he rejected for doing what was right what was he rejected from his brothers for for telling the truth of no fault of his own he finds himself in this situations and now he's in prison and in prison now he's there and and now it seems like he's further than he's ever been from the prophecy but don't ever forget the Way Up Is Down and now he goes from Palestine through hatred through Envy through Strife amen through rejection he winds up in Egypt that's where he needed to be for the prophecy from Egypt he goes from Potiphar's house and slavery now he goes down to the dungeon because he's got to get closer to Pharaoh than what he was and now he's right underneath the throne can you imagine what was passing through Joseph's mind oh if if Joseph was a man of like passions like me I can tell you there had been a thousand questions rolling through my mind I would have been bouncing from one day not losing the promise of the other day wondering if I even heard from God and now we find a butler and a baker they get sent to prison they have a dream and his gift is still operating in prison and in prison so far away from the prophecy so far away from what he thought God had showed him he finds the Butler and the baker with the dream and he gives the interpretation of the dream and one will be restored and the other one's going to be killed and it happens exactly like he said but he asked the one that was going to be restored when you get restored your place would you please speak on my behalf to pharaoh and he says I will I will I Hey listen buddy you saved me you gave me the right I'm here for you then when he gets restored to his position what does he do he forgets about Joseph he he's now amen now that this man is restored to his position he forgets Joseph he forgets the one who interpret his dream he forgets the prophet that's down there in prison he forgets all of it amen but I'd like to tell you he was ordained to forget God erased his mind amen it wasn't that the baker or the butler who I think it was the butler it wasn't that the butler was against Joseph it was that God was for Joseph and had to erase his mind amen because that wasn't the time if you get things out of sequence it never works out right if he would have spoke for him on that day he might have got out of prison but he would have never went to the right hand of the throne it had to come a time when Pharaoh needed a prophecy he needed a dream interpreted and God wiped out the memory of the baker or the butler listen has anybody ever forgot a promise to you has anybody ever failed to keep the word to you has anybody ever rejected you did anybody ever tell a lie about you well praise God well praise God did Brothers Branham say or did he not say nothing's out of kilter everything clock's just ticking right on time all these things has to be this way hey that's either true or it's not true the lies were necessary the rejection was necessary the deception was necessary the framing was necessary the forgetfulness was necessary Joseph has an option he can either rot away in bitterness or he can trust God you and I have the same option listen sometimes not sometimes all the time if God needs to move us into position do you think he's only going to use positive things and move as a position do you think he may also use negative things to move us into position amen you know why they wear Spurs right you know why a cowboy wears Spurs so he can dig those spurs into the flanks of the horse and encourage the horse to go forward it doesn't feel good but it's necessary to get the horse to move in the right direction amen he told Paul it's hard for you to kick against the bricks what's the prick something God's using to move us along so now he's a forgotten friend in prison serves people does the best he can in every situation and now he's forgotten left into the dungeon his friend is promoted and he's left behind and his friend doesn't remember him but there come a day that Pharaoh Dreamed a Dream when he Dreamed a Dream there was nobody that could tell it no magician nobody in all the kingdom and it happened to be that that day when nobody can interpret that all of a sudden the baker's memory comes back he goes now I remember oh Pharaoh I forgot I was supposed to tell you this a long time ago there's a man down there in that dungeon and this is what happened and this and he said call him up they call him up they shaved him they gave him a garment gave him a shower amen he comes before Pharaoh why because that was the appointed moment that was the appointed time he couldn't get there before then but what did he had to do he had to get to Egypt God made sure he got to Egypt amen it didn't feel good it didn't look good but God got him to Egypt from Egypt he had to get to the dungeon and God got him from Egypt to the dungeon and from the dungeon he had to wait there and be there close to Pharaoh for the time that Pharaoh needed an interpretation to his dream because God was going to take him from the dungeon to the right hand of power and overnight overnight he moves from the dungeon to the right hand of power amen this is what Joseph says to his brother and after his dad dies they're worried that after Israel's dead that now he's going to get his revenge and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place of God but as for you ye thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as at this day to save much people alive can it be that people's people's evil intentions towards you is God's Good Will towards you is that the scriptures so we see that it's very possible that somebody's evil intentions about you could be God's Good Will towards you that God means it for good they mean it for you and they do mean it for evil in all intention his brother's been it for evil but God meant it for good listen we're going to have a choice in life friends we're going to choose to be eat up in bitterness and hate everything that happened to us and hate everybody who did us wrong or we're going to finally get to the place to say I'm in the place of God amen it was an ugly Road it had lots of up and down I went from high places to Low Places and Low Places to high places and back again I've had detours I've had confusions I've had Church splits I've had failed Ministry I've had all kinds of troubles in my life but I all I know is I am now in the place of God how I got here is a mystery to me but I'm in the place of God and God watched over my steps because the steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord and he delighteth in his way as if we can come to the place where we can say I'm in the place of God but my mother rejected me my father abused me somebody took advantage of me listen it doesn't matter are you in the place of God Amen has God got a plan for your life everything else could have been chaos all around you but what is different from your life than the characters in The Bible amen then we can find ourselves in the place of God through rejection through abuse through neglect through highs through lows through promotion through devotion through all of that if we can find ourselves in the place of God then we can look back and say it was all meant for good God was leading God knew what he was doing God knew how to get me to the place I was amen God knew what the Apostle Paul needed to keep him from being puffed up with pride he knew that he needed a messenger of the devil and affliction in his eye and you know he sought the Lord three times because his Affliction was somewhat debilitating to him amen but he realized that God says my grace is sufficient for you this was given to you so that you would not be puffed up and he says well I'll therefore glory in my affirmities we think this isn't right this can't be right this shouldn't happen to me I shouldn't be in this condition God knows what we need God knows what his children needs God knows I shouldn't be like this this shouldn't have happened to me but I say oh God I'm in the place of God where would I be if everything had been smooth in life where would I be if I had no Affliction what kind of person would I be if I never suffered rejection and had to go search my soul and find out where I was if I hadn't had doubts if I hadn't had confusion if I hadn't been knocked down a few times what kind of human being would I be what kind of character would I display amen where would I find The Virtue to keep going where would I find the strength where would revelation of God Christ come where would it come if it wasn't under those deep dark times those pressing times and we find when we get into those pressing times that squeeze us amen listen there may be a squeeze coming but we've all felt squeezes in our life and those squeezing times what was it supposed to do it was supposed to bring the Life of Christ out I'll ask you this the greatest testimonies in your life that they come from Good Times or bad times the times that you know God moved and you know God answered and you can see God vindicate himself was that good times or dark times where those easy times are trouble sometimes I'm just asking our trials are promotions what's God doing our duty is to express God how am I going to express God how am I going to show virtue unless I'm going to need some virtue how am I going to show Temperance unless I'm going to need in this situation I'm going to need some self-control it's going to show love unless there's a situation that needs love where will we show The Life of Christ in opposition to the Life of Christ my duty Express God how am I going to do that when your squeeze comes down then you'll see Christ when the squeeze comes down there's times there's things that we don't really know about ourselves we can make bold proclamations people are human beings are good I'm this I'm that Peter he looks at Jesus and says though all men forsake you I'll not leave thee you look at Peter and say oh Peter but my goodness I've got to look at myself and say oh Chad you foolish human being You childish human that lets foolish things come out of your mouth everybody does this I'm not you don't know what you'll do until that time comes you may feel like now your emotions may tell you one thing and you may feel so strong and so bold but listen there's a lot of people that thought they'd never leave this message that don't believe brother Branham was a prophet right now if we're ever going to be anything it's going to be him in US it's going to be his life his seed his Gene of life manifesting itself through us God Jesus looks at Peter says Peter Satan has desired to Sifty like wheat he didn't say I prayed to the father so that you can bypass that trial no Peter needed to be sifted like wheat because Peter had way too much self-confidence way too much pride he was way too arrogant and he felt like he could do something and he displayed how self-confident he was when he drew his sword and tried to kill the servant of the high priest he was showing how proud and arrogant and how self-sufficient that he was amen and Jesus didn't say his Satan has desired that's asking permission Satan has desire to Sifty like we he didn't tell him no he said go ahead but I've prayed for you that your faith failed not Peter needed to be sifted he needed to be humbled he needed to run out and weep on his face and cry and repent what do we need we need the same thing we need to be knocked off of our high horse like Paul was knocked off of his high horse we need to be smoked we need to be afflicted why because there's too much pride in the human race there's too much self-sufficiency too much arrogancy amen every time we start feeling like we got our act together we can figure this out we know what to do God will stick his foot out and trip you so you fall and bust your nose come up with a bloody nose and you realize I can't even walk unless he leads to you and that busted nose is the best thing that ever happened to you or I oh my goodness this is hard this is re ese the real people in a real world and it's really going to overcome by the grace of God by predestination not by human effort not by human willpower not by our brains and our will and all I I am so tired of an arrogant attitude in me I'm so tired of fighting with pride all the time I am so sick of it amen I say God help me help me Lord to stay humble to stay nothing so that you can be something Peter goes from I'll never forsake you oh men oh men leave you alone I mean what's he saying is he showing his love for God no he's showing his arrogancy his pride in himself it looked religious it looked like love it was self-love on display to finally God has a broken man that will humble himself and that it will repent before Gone when he has a repentant broken man then he can fill that man with the Holy Ghost and he can take him out to the gate called beautiful and he can speak in the name of Jesus Christ and that man can go leaping and running and and then all can gather around and they begin they begin to praise uh they can begin to praise Peter and Peter will say why look you upon us as though we in our strength have healed this man we haven't done anything but in the name of Jesus Christ who you crucified this man as him it's not us it's Christ oh what did Peter need Peter needed to be sifted like wheat Peter needed to fall Peter needed to repent what do we need we need everything God has ordained for us so that we can come to perfection I mean it's even hard to shout hallelujah because you know what's coming next but it's the reality it's what we need the Way Up Is Down God help us let's go to Genesis 45 I want to read this as we close Genesis 45. thank you Genesis 45 verse 1. then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried because ever caused caused every man to go out for men there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his Brethren and he wept aloud and the Egyptians in the house of pharaoh heard Joseph said unto his brother I am Joseph does my father yet live and his Brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold in into Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God didn't send me before you to preserve life listen did it did he make his brothers apologize to him before he forgave them did he demand they grovel at his feet do you see our horrible attitudes we say well I'll not forget until they come and apologize no brother bear said forgive them anyways don't require anything of them Joseph had such a revelation that he was in the place of God that that prophecy that he saw as a dream as a boy every step was moving him that problem he was so assured of his position and where he was now he could look back and say don't you worry about it don't you even feel bad about yourselves can you say that to the one who rejected you can you say that to the one who lied about you the one who ruined your reputation can you say that about them I say of not we need a greater revelation of where God has brought us and who we are we need a revelation that we're in the place of God let's keep reading I want to read five again B now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be earring nor Harvest and God sent me before you to preserve you of posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great Deliverance so now it was not you that sent me hither but God and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and Lord of all his house and I ruler throughout all the land of Egypt it wasn't you it was God amen it wasn't you who moved me it wasn't you who caused this it wasn't you it was God Romans 8 28 says and we know that all things work together for good to them who love God to them who are the called according to his purpose Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says now there is only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denominations and and no not nothing else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on the predestinated fruit and she is ripening into christ-like Fruit bringing forth to say mellowness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him what is my duty to bear his name how am I going to bear his name and promote my name at the same time how am I going to seek my welfare my reputation my promotion and promote his name I'm going to have to become nothing and nobody and when I'm having a hard time doing that God knows how to help me when I'm having a hard time losing my reputation God knows how to help me and I have a hard time giving up my image giving up my desires giving up my pleasure God knows listen when you hit a really hard time in life I mean a hard hard time where you don't know if you're going to make it through or not when disaster strikes your family distracts your life when you've heard news that you need to see no way out I tell you right then there's no desire for you in the pleasures you're not going to pick up a TV you're not going to go download this or that I mean what you're going to do is hit your knees and pray because that all desire for flesh and that desire it begins to fade away when it gets really down to the nitty-gritty God knows how to get us to pray God help me that's all I can say friends is God help me God help me to see my trials as promotions I don't want to run kicking and streaming and crazy like a crazy man every time something comes up I want to stand there and say God I'm your child and I'm in the place you place me and I'm going to wherever you want me to be help me to express your nature in this trial give me patience Give Me Faith give me virtue let let this trial produce more of you in my life God I need something more than myself because myself is scared myself is worried myself wants to run but I'm going to stand right here and Trust You amen would you express yourself through this body of Flesh when I die he can live amen the way up is down God bless you let's all stand musicians if you'll come please our trials are promotions and the development of a christ-like character the question is do we want a christ-like character foreign do we want to be like Jesus then hang on fasten your seatbelt it might be a bumpy ride because that nature has to be expressed in all kinds of opposition look at the opposition Jesus Christ had in order to express the nature that was in him tempted in every way yet without sin tempted and pride tempted in this and spit upon and mocked and all of these things my but you know what he passed the test I say God if that life be in me if I can stay out of the way and surrender by the power of your spirit you can live the same life through me help me God amen if the squeeze starts coming down a little bit just recognize what he's after is fragrance what he's after is perfume not the destruction of Our Lives but the perfume that's laying trapped in the Rose God wants to come out amen he's given us his life he's given us his promise we have the sieging of God by the predestination and he knows how to draw that life and all that character out of us I said God allow it to work in me help me gone and you know what I want to say I've had some rough times I've had some things that I'd rather not happen in my life if I had some circumstances my fault and the fault of other people there's things that other people have done that have really hurt me there's things that I have done that have really hurt me there's things I have done that have really hurt other people there's things that I'm ashamed of and I regret with all my heart but I'll tell you something I'm in the place of God by the grace of God I'm here by his grace I'm here with the Revelation that he's given me through every trial and I'm here amen because he predestinated me to be here I say oh God I want to surrender all my life to you I don't want to be bitter I don't want to be angry I just want to be thankful that God can take everything the devil means for good and he can move it to his intended purpose for me that he can take everything that was meant to destroy me and he can bring me into my place I just thank him for that are you grateful for a God who can turn everything to good amen let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we're so thankful Lord that you have given us precious promises promises Lord that we will have your very character your likeness that you will bring us into your very image you've promised that in this age this bride will be so much like you she will be in your very image that she will be you that your life will be in US Lord and that we will surrender and we will die and we will give up so that your life can manifest itself in US God everything that's happened to us is by your grace every transition every move whether hurtful or not you meant it for good God if there's those that are here that are struggling with bitterness [Music] over afflictions over hurts from the past bitter at a Ministry bitter at a parent bitter at a loved one bitter at a spouse God I pray that you take him to a higher level of revelation that you would lift them above the carnal and above all the pain and all the hurt and bring him to a realm with Eagle Vision where they could look down and see that everything that was intended for evil you're intending it for good that nothing can happen in a child of a Believer unless you first allowed it and let it be according to your will for your purpose God I pray that if there's any amongst us that are even re resentful at ourselves hating ourselves for our actions God may we just lay it all away forget about it let all the bitterness just be sucked out by the knowledge that you're in control and you're going to wind us up you're going to finish this race and you're going to bring us to the place you want us to be in every evil thing you'll work for good in every mistake has done us a world of good you're bringing us to humility you're bringing us to a greater reverence and a greater surrender God there's many things I'm ashamed of Lord but I commit them to you and I ask you forgive me Lord many regrets that I have in life but I know that all things work together for good God would you take my failures would you take my mistakes check the things I'm ashamed of Lord and would you work it together for good Lord and bring me to your expected end now there's anybody that's still hurting from the past I pray you would pour the bomb of Gilead into their heart by Revelation Lord may they find that you do all things well and you know every hurt and you know every transition in life and you know the why behind it all when we can't possibly fathom why when no human being can answer why why would this happen why would it be permitted why would it be allowed we don't know why the good I trust that you do help me to trust you more heal the wounds Lord that are in your children bring us into a greater confidence in you in your word and in the promise of this hour May more faith come out of us and more virtue and more Temperance and more knowledge more brotherly kindness and more charity until you complete your work in us and we stand in your very image bearing your name to this dark world and living your life in human flesh through us may you accomplish that purpose in each one of us Lord we surrender to you and we say that you're good in all things that you do all things well and my life is in your hand and you know Lord every transition and I'm saying you've done it all well Lord I'm not blaming you or accusing you of anything you've done it all well Lord and I want from my heart to forgive everybody that's done wrong to me Lord because you do all things well and everything is going to bring us to your expected end God bring healing Let Your Grace take its place in our lives Let Your Love be expressed and may we be able to rise above all the wicked and all the evil may we be able to stand in a higher plane than we've ever stood before that by going down you intend to bring us up these things are our promotions we love you Lord help us to Bear your name your name not our name your name in this life we love you bless your people as we part we separate and go different ways in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] to see [Music] oh yes it's Jesus [Music] oh for the more I see of this old the less it means to me for a Jesus [Music] to see to see oh it's Jesus [Music] I really want to see [Music] for it [Music] I really want me for the more I see of this over the less it means to me for it's Jesus to see I just remembered a story brother man tells he's in Shreveport Louisiana and he's talking about a woman that's Bound in a wheelchair brother member says we see the sister in a wheelchair and we've prayed for her I don't know why she's not here we've seen God do much heal much worse than that even the prophet of God doesn't know why she's not healed he he's prayed for the dead and they've been raised blind no eyeballs and sockets and God has made iron balls he doesn't understand why God doesn't heal This Woman's wheelchairs we prayed for her many times he says but every time I come and see her and see her light up and smile amen she's so she's so pleasant and so happy found in a wheelchair and brother barely makes this statement he says maybe God lets her stay that way because she encourages me we don't know why things happen in our lives we don't know why we go through circumstances we don't know why some things remain and some things are removed we don't know why but oh God help me to have joy and love you in it all help me to be pleasant and smile in it all help me to do something if you're allowing this to encourage somebody else if you're allowing this to build character in me if you're allowing this to defeat the Devil whatever it is let me have joy in the midst and let me praise you no matter what happens I don't understand it all but I know you're good and I know your word is true and I know that everything you promised will take place in my life we don't have to have it all figured out but oh my we can trust him in it all we can thank him in the midst of every trial and every storm we can thank him because he does all things well and he's creating an opportunity an opportunity to display himself whether it be a little girl with joy Bound in a wheelchair he's displaying he could display himself by raising her up but he could display himself by having joy in the midst of a trial say God display yourself in me and every child let your virtue come let your life come let me bear your name in every circumstance and every situation that's my purpose to be here to manifest God in this community in this nation where I sit God help us he will help us why because he chose us for this manifestation and he chose us for this time and he chose us to display and to bear his name as much as Paul was a chosen vessel to bear his name we are a chosen vessel to pair his name Paul had to be knocked off of his high horse I've been I've had to be knocked off of my high horse but oh I've been chosen to bear his name may I bear it with all that's in me amen God bless you all let's sing that again brother Jesus [Music] foreign [Music]
