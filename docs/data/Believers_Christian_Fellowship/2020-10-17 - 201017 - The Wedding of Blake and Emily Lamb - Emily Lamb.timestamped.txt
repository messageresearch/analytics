[36:28] you both shall live
[36:30] and let's just bow our heads and ask the
[36:33] lord's blessing over this
[36:34] ceremony lord jesus we thank you father
[36:39] for the privilege to be here today lord
[36:42] as we've come lord because you have
[36:44] drawn
[36:45] blake and emily together you had this
[36:49] in your mind before the foundation of
[36:50] the world and lord we've come down to
[36:53] time
[36:54] and in this element of time lord these
[36:56] two have grown up and they've come to
[36:58] the place where
[36:59] you have ordained that the two shall
[37:00] name now be won
[37:02] i pray that you bless this ceremony
[37:04] bless all that we say and do
[37:06] may we bring glory and honor to your
[37:07] name and to your plan
[37:09] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[37:15] well this is a different wedding for me
[37:18] i've been officiant at several weddings
[37:22] i've participated in several weddings
[37:25] but this is the first time i've
[37:28] wedded my son to his bride
[37:32] and uh it's a different experience for
[37:34] us i've always looked
[37:36] at the family and said what's the big
[37:37] deal you just walk up it's easy but now
[37:40] i know
[37:41] what the big deal is and so blake and
[37:44] emily had desired that i would
[37:47] do the ceremony and perform the service
[37:49] and it's an honor for me to do so but
[37:52] but it's uh i was thinking and
[37:54] reflecting on what do you say this is
[37:56] your
[37:57] first born son none his bride
[38:01] and god is ordained and when you think
[38:04] about it you think of what a wonderful
[38:06] exciting time this
[38:07] is exciting for the families exciting
[38:10] for friends
[38:11] exciting for the local assembly because
[38:13] as a local church we've seen both of
[38:15] these individuals grow up in the church
[38:18] come to maturity and make choices for
[38:20] the lord and make sacrifices for christ
[38:22] and
[38:23] seeing god unite the two together and
[38:25] now we've come to this ceremony which is
[38:27] a tremendous time of celebration and
[38:29] rejoicing for what god has done and when
[38:32] you reflect on that you
[38:34] you can't help but reflect on the
[38:37] great purpose and plan of god because
[38:40] this is not the only
[38:42] rejoicing that's going on because the
[38:43] bride is uniting with the bridegroom
[38:46] and it's also a rejoicing time it's an
[38:48] exciting time
[38:51] if we look in the scriptures you can see
[38:53] that the bible starts
[38:55] with marriage and ends with marriage in
[38:58] the book of genesis god
[39:00] creates all things and he speaks his
[39:03] word and his word goes to work and
[39:05] forms and fashions the earth to the way
[39:07] he had it in his mind the way he wants
[39:09] it to look
[39:10] and god is working a plan over the days
[39:13] of creation
[39:14] and he's getting everything just so just
[39:16] the way he wants
[39:17] just the way he desired it in his heart
[39:20] but you can see he's building he's
[39:22] building from day one
[39:23] to day two to day three it's a building
[39:26] it's a progressing
[39:27] in god's mind his image is coming more
[39:29] into the
[39:30] reality and becoming clearer and clearer
[39:32] what he wants
[39:34] but but he's not finished until he has a
[39:37] man
[39:38] in the garden of eden and as he has this
[39:40] man in the garden of eden
[39:42] it looks like his work may be done that
[39:44] he saved the best for last but
[39:46] but there's a scripture that says it
[39:49] isn't god looked and said it is not good
[39:51] that man should dwell alone so you could
[39:54] see that god wasn't finished
[39:55] yet with his great creation and he
[39:58] couldn't be finished until he lays adam
[40:00] down and
[40:01] he strikes a blow to a rib under his
[40:04] side and he pulls out
[40:05] what we'll need to make the elements
[40:07] that will be needed to make his bride
[40:09] he takes that bride and he unites them
[40:11] back together
[40:12] in what is the crowning act and crowning
[40:14] achievement of all of creation
[40:17] and then after god has
[40:20] finished making everything he looked at
[40:22] all that he made
[40:23] and all that he had done and he said it
[40:26] is very good and it says and on the
[40:29] seventh day
[40:30] god rested god would not have rested
[40:34] if there was still more work to do god
[40:37] would not have rested
[40:39] if he had not completed the picture he
[40:41] was trying to paint
[40:43] the great masterpiece that he was trying
[40:45] to his mind that he had tried to portray
[40:47] he had finally got it so he could rest
[40:49] from his work because he had finished
[40:52] and what was that great masterpiece a
[40:54] man
[40:55] in his bride in a perfect setting
[40:58] and god could rest and we know that that
[41:02] image was destroyed by satan he came
[41:04] down and through deception
[41:07] he caused doubt on the word and a fall
[41:10] and since then god has been working to
[41:12] build the masterpiece again
[41:15] but if you look in revelation 19 verse 6
[41:19] it says and i heard as it were the voice
[41:20] of a great multitude
[41:22] and as the voice of many waters and as
[41:24] the voice of mighty thundering
[41:25] saying alleluia for the lord god
[41:28] omnipotent reigneth
[41:29] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[41:31] honor to him
[41:33] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[41:35] and his wife hath made herself ready
[41:38] and her was granted that she should be
[41:39] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[41:42] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[41:45] of the saints
[41:47] what was causing all heaven to rejoice
[41:49] what was the thunderings and the
[41:51] shoutings
[41:51] and the alleluias because the great god
[41:54] omnipotent raiden
[41:55] in his bride has made herself ready the
[41:58] marriage of the lamb had come
[42:00] and what had been destroyed in the
[42:02] garden of eden
[42:03] god had now restored his great
[42:06] masterpiece his great plan
[42:09] and we know that
[42:12] you know we come to the end of the book
[42:14] and the end of the story we see this
[42:15] great
[42:17] climax coming the marriage of the lamb
[42:20] is coming and it just happens to be that
[42:22] blake's last name is lamb
[42:26] and here we have a perfect picture the
[42:29] marriage of
[42:30] not the lamb but a lamb and his bride
[42:34] and so we can rejoice and we can shout
[42:37] hallelujah and glory to god for what
[42:39] god's done on earth
[42:41] but this is only a reflection of his
[42:42] great desire of what god's been trying
[42:45] to do all along
[42:46] so when we come to a wedding like this
[42:48] it's more than just what we see because
[42:50] what we see
[42:50] represents what we don't see what we
[42:53] don't see in the spiritual is happening
[42:55] all around us
[42:56] his bride has made herself ready
[42:59] and uniting with her bridegroom
[43:03] gone after he had created his great
[43:06] masterpiece and went to his rest
[43:09] lucifer shows up and through the serpent
[43:11] he
[43:12] it says in genesis 3 13 it says in the
[43:14] lord god
[43:15] said unto the woman what has this house
[43:18] done
[43:19] something happened something was now
[43:21] broken in god's great masterpiece
[43:23] something was wrong
[43:24] and he came to discover what was wrong
[43:26] and he asked her what was done
[43:27] and the woman said the serpent beguiled
[43:29] me and i did eat the word begow means
[43:32] deceived
[43:34] he deceived me tricked me i fell into a
[43:37] trap
[43:38] i was deceived and now i did i broke the
[43:41] word
[43:42] i was deceived by the serpent and i
[43:44] broke the word and the breaking the
[43:46] commandment of god
[43:47] broke the perfect image of god and now
[43:50] the man and his wife were cast out of
[43:51] eden and
[43:53] looked like it was ruined but god's plan
[43:57] can never be defeated by satan
[44:00] god had a master plan and what he had
[44:03] done in the beginning and the creation
[44:05] only was foretelling what he really
[44:08] wanted to do
[44:09] because god was not after just one man
[44:11] and one woman but he was after christ
[44:14] and christ's bride which is a
[44:15] mini-membered bride the saints have gone
[44:19] the woman was deceived the first timothy
[44:22] 2 tells us that
[44:23] adam was not deceived he said an adam
[44:26] was not the seed but the woman being
[44:27] deceived
[44:28] was in the transgression adam was not
[44:31] deceived he knew
[44:32] what was right and what was wrong the
[44:34] woman was deceived
[44:36] but adam was not deceived and adam
[44:38] willfully chose
[44:39] to walk out with his wife to save her so
[44:41] that she wouldn't be lost
[44:43] foreshadowing a christ jesus christ
[44:45] would come and
[44:46] willingly take on our sin upon himself
[44:48] and suffer
[44:49] our reproaches suffer our sin and die on
[44:52] calvary
[44:53] to save us christ was never defeated
[44:56] that christ was never deceived
[44:58] but his bride had been deceived because
[45:01] after the first image fell
[45:03] god now begins to work and he makes a
[45:06] promise of a restoration and
[45:08] he begins to restore back and in that
[45:10] restoration he chooses a man named
[45:12] abraham
[45:13] he's going to choose abraham's seed to
[45:15] be a peculiar people
[45:16] and now we know the exodus story he
[45:18] sends moses down
[45:20] to draw that special people out of
[45:23] bondage
[45:23] out of egypt and bring them into the
[45:26] wilderness
[45:27] so that he can unite with them so that
[45:28] he can marry them he's going to have a
[45:30] people peculiar to himself and he
[45:32] chooses the nation of israel
[45:34] the children of abraham but if we read
[45:37] the story
[45:38] the same thing happens once again the
[45:41] nation of israel is deceived on the word
[45:43] they begin to mix religion together with
[45:45] the law of moses and the word of god
[45:48] and they get it all corrupt and they
[45:49] fall until god and the book of isaiah in
[45:52] the book of jeremiah sends prophets to
[45:54] call them
[45:54] an adulterous woman he says i brought
[45:57] you to marry you
[45:58] in the wilderness but yet you didn't
[46:00] keep my word
[46:01] so once again it looks like it failed
[46:05] then christ comes and the bible calls
[46:08] him
[46:09] the last adam in first corinthians 15
[46:12] 45 it says and so does it written the
[46:14] first adam was made a living soul
[46:17] the last adam was made a quickening
[46:19] spirit
[46:20] so god had restored an atom and this
[46:24] adam had not fallen but this adam had
[46:26] taken
[46:26] our fall and he had paid the price so
[46:29] that we could be free
[46:30] and now if there's a last adam must
[46:33] there be a last eve
[46:35] if god had restored adam will he restore
[46:39] his wife we see this is very planned and
[46:43] that's what the apostle paul talks about
[46:45] for in second corinthians 11 the apostle
[46:47] paul says for i am jealous over you
[46:49] with a godly jealousy for i have
[46:51] espoused you to one husband
[46:53] and that i may present you a chaste
[46:55] virgin to christ
[46:56] so paul says i have engaged you espoused
[46:59] you
[47:00] to one husband that i might present you
[47:02] a chaste virgin to christ
[47:04] what's paul doing he's trying to bring
[47:06] back this image
[47:07] adam had been restored and paid the
[47:09] price and made a way back
[47:11] now adam must have a wife there must be
[47:13] an eve
[47:15] and he says and paul says i have engaged
[47:18] you
[47:18] to christ but i'm worried about
[47:20] something
[47:22] he said i he said i'm jealous i have
[47:24] espoused you to one husband and then i
[47:26] may present you as a chaste virgin to
[47:27] christ
[47:28] but i fear lest by any means as the
[47:30] serpent begot eve through his septility
[47:32] so your mind should be corrupted from
[47:34] the simplicity
[47:36] that is in christ paul
[47:40] the apostle paul was afraid that this
[47:42] new gentile church
[47:44] would go the way of eve would go the way
[47:47] of
[47:47] israel he said i'm jealous over you i'm
[47:50] afraid that you'll be beguiled
[47:52] as he was beguiled we find out that's
[47:55] what happened
[47:56] now what happened to israel now
[48:00] happened to the church they began to be
[48:03] deceived
[48:04] by ideas of man by corrupt doctrines
[48:07] that came in
[48:08] now it looks like all would be lost
[48:12] but praise god there's a promise in
[48:13] revelation 19.
[48:15] the bride has made herself ready the
[48:18] marriage of the lamb has
[48:20] come and if it's written in the word
[48:23] it will happen satan will not have
[48:25] victory
[48:26] he will not stop god's plan for god is
[48:29] determined
[48:30] to have a bride for his son christ
[48:34] he's determined to restore what had been
[48:36] fallen all the way back in eden
[48:38] as a foreshadow of something greater in
[48:40] our day and he restored it through the
[48:42] last adam and now
[48:43] he's restoring the last eve if we read
[48:46] revelations three
[48:48] speaking of the laodicean church the
[48:50] last church the final church the seventh
[48:52] church
[48:53] and the first part of the book of
[48:54] revelation it says because thou sayest i
[48:57] am rich
[48:58] and increase with goods and have need of
[49:00] nothing and knoweth not thou are
[49:01] wretched
[49:02] and miserable and poor and blind and
[49:04] naked
[49:05] i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried
[49:07] in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[49:10] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[49:11] clothed and that the
[49:13] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[49:15] anoint thine eyes with i salve
[49:16] that thou may see as many as i love i
[49:19] rebuke and chasten
[49:21] be zealous therefore and repent
[49:24] when you come to the last church the
[49:26] final one
[49:27] we find that she says i am rich and
[49:31] increased with goods and have need of
[49:32] nothing
[49:34] but god says that you are miserable
[49:37] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[49:41] here you have that bride and just as
[49:43] paul was
[49:44] worried that she would be deceived and
[49:45] fall she fell
[49:47] but god had a plan he says
[49:51] i counsel to buy of me gold tried in the
[49:54] fire
[49:56] that thou mayest be rich in white
[49:57] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[49:59] and the shame of thy nakedness do not
[50:01] appear and anoint thine eyes with i said
[50:03] that thou mayest see as many as i love
[50:06] i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[50:09] therefore and repent
[50:11] god said come to me come to me
[50:15] don't go anywhere else don't listen to
[50:17] any other voice
[50:18] come to me and buy of me gold white
[50:22] raiment
[50:23] and i salve and god in this day has
[50:25] provided
[50:26] gold and white raiment and i says
[50:30] he says in ephesians chapter 5 verse 25
[50:34] husbands love your wives even as christ
[50:36] also loved the church
[50:38] and gave himself forward that he might
[50:39] sanctify
[50:41] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[50:43] by the word
[50:44] that he might present it to himself a
[50:46] glorious church
[50:48] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[50:50] thing
[50:51] but that should be holy and without
[50:53] blemish
[50:55] god has already made the preparation god
[50:58] has already known
[50:59] what would happen to the church ages and
[51:02] god has said
[51:03] that he will cleanse he will sanctify
[51:05] and cleanse his church
[51:07] with the washing of water by the word
[51:11] and so what was it that he fell by the
[51:14] word
[51:14] what was it that israel fell by the word
[51:18] what was it that the early church fell
[51:19] by the word
[51:21] but what is it that's going to cleanse
[51:23] this bride the word
[51:25] the word will restore all that was lost
[51:29] the word will wash away
[51:30] all the corruption from man-made
[51:32] religion and man's ideas and schools of
[51:35] theology
[51:36] the word will wash it away the word will
[51:39] be restored
[51:40] lost through the dark ages but out of
[51:42] the dark ages they started printing
[51:44] bibles
[51:45] bibles were kept from the people now the
[51:46] bible come back into the hand of god's
[51:48] people
[51:49] and god began to restore the word one
[51:51] revelation by one revelation
[51:53] until they could see clearer and clearer
[51:55] and clear
[51:56] all that was lost until they finally in
[51:59] this day god through a prophetic
[52:00] ministry could bring us back
[52:02] to the full understanding of the full
[52:05] bible
[52:05] so that there can be a purifying water
[52:08] to wash this bride
[52:10] and clothe her with a white garment
[52:12] unspotted
[52:13] by man unspotted by deception or
[52:17] reasonings of man
[52:18] but washed lily white purified
[52:22] prepared for the wedding day
[52:26] i want to finish by reading the first
[52:28] verse we read
[52:30] revelations 19 6-8 and i heard it i
[52:33] heard as it were the voice of a great
[52:35] multitude and as the voice of many
[52:36] waters
[52:37] and as the voice of mighty thunderings
[52:40] saying alleluia for the lord god
[52:42] omnipotent reigneth
[52:43] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[52:45] honor to him
[52:46] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[52:50] and his wife has made herself ready
[52:54] and to her was granted that she should
[52:55] be arrayed in fine linen
[52:57] clean and white for the fine linen is
[53:00] the righteousness of the saints
[53:03] emily didn't just walk up here
[53:04] haphazardly
[53:06] she didn't decide this morning what she
[53:08] would wear
[53:10] she didn't just wake up
[53:13] late forget to set the alarm run and put
[53:16] anything on she had in the closet and
[53:18] run up here to marry
[53:19] but she's been preparing for this for a
[53:21] long time
[53:23] she's been careful of her wedding dress
[53:26] she's been careful to keep it
[53:27] to watch over not to let it get spotted
[53:30] or stained or corrupted in any way
[53:32] to make sure that she was prepared that
[53:34] she prepared herself and the scripture
[53:36] says the bride
[53:37] had prepared herself jesus said when he
[53:40] left i go to prepare a place for you
[53:43] that i can come again you can be where i
[53:45] am
[53:46] and blake has been preparing a place
[53:49] literally
[53:51] painting and hammering and nailing and
[53:53] patching drywall he's been playing
[53:55] preparing a place
[53:56] but as he's been preparing his place
[53:58] doing his part
[53:59] emily's been doing her part in preparing
[54:01] herself preparing
[54:03] to leave the known the all the known and
[54:05] the familiar to move into the unfamiliar
[54:08] to leave family to be united with her
[54:10] bridegroom
[54:11] and then preparing herself for this day
[54:14] the right
[54:15] the right attire her hair everything
[54:17] she's thought about she's prepared for
[54:19] she's been careful over
[54:21] and i want to say the marriage of the
[54:24] lamb is come
[54:26] this is the day that the white raiment
[54:28] has been given for us to put on
[54:31] which is the word of god the bride has
[54:33] made herself ready she's careful
[54:34] she doesn't just take any word and put
[54:37] it on
[54:38] but she has to take the pure word of god
[54:40] unaltered by man and unchanged and
[54:42] undoctored by reasoning
[54:44] she has to take the word and she's
[54:46] careful about it and she's got to
[54:48] put it on and to put on the word means
[54:50] to live it
[54:52] she takes it and becomes a written
[54:54] epistle
[54:55] blake's been busy emily's been busy
[54:59] but i say christ has been busy
[55:02] and his bride has been careful to make
[55:05] sure she stays under the washing of the
[55:07] water of the word
[55:08] and make sure that everything she puts
[55:10] on is the white garment that's prepared
[55:12] for her
[55:14] this is what thrills our souls what
[55:17] we're looking at now with great
[55:18] excitement
[55:20] in a day when the world is in chaos
