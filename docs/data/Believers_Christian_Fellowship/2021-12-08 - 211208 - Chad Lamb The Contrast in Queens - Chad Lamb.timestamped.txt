[9:21] verse 21 oh i have one more announcement
[9:23] i'm sorry i come loaded uh watch night
[9:26] service i haven't announced yet but we'd
[9:28] like to do watch night service on friday
[9:30] december 31st uh we'll do it like we've
[9:33] been doing it in the past at 8 30 we'll
[9:35] go 8 30 to around midnight and then have
[9:38] communion together right at midnight or
[9:40] shortly thereafter so if you've got
[9:42] especially you'd like to sing if the
[9:44] lord lay something on your heart if
[9:46] families or groups or singles whoever
[9:48] would like to sing we'd just love to
[9:50] spend some time together
[9:53] as usual our watch night is not
[9:54] something we share with the world it's
[9:56] just us it's just a family gathering
[9:58] we're here to thank god for the past
[10:00] year and look forward to the next year
[10:02] for god's blessings and and we just want
[10:04] to spend some time together really sing
[10:06] really worship the lord amen and maybe
[10:09] hear some testimonies here from
[10:10] different brothers and spend that time
[10:12] together so we'll be doing that friday
[10:14] december 31st
[10:16] um
[10:17] and so we'll take communion that
[10:20] friday night actually be early saturday
[10:22] morning so we won't be having the second
[10:24] communion service that sunday on on
[10:26] january 2nd and also
[10:29] because of the friday night service
[10:30] we're going to cancel the wednesday
[10:32] before that so wednesday december 29th
[10:34] we won't have service we'll be having
[10:35] the watch night service on friday and
[10:37] then the regular service on sunday
[10:41] so god bless you
[10:42] no more announcements
[10:44] i think revelation chapter 3 verse 21
[10:50] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[10:52] sit with me in my throne
[10:54] even as i also am overcome and set down
[10:56] with my father and his throne amen you
[10:59] can have your seats may the lord add his
[11:01] blessing to the reading of his word and
[11:04] bless us tonight
[11:05] we pray
[11:07] so
[11:08] i want to take for a subject
[11:10] as a title the contrast in queens
[11:14] the contrast in queens and it's going to
[11:16] be kind of a continuation of what we
[11:18] were looking at on sunday because on
[11:20] sunday we were looking down through the
[11:22] bible and you can see that we talked
[11:24] about the mystery in plain view and when
[11:26] we come to the end time
[11:28] the prophet of god comes and and through
[11:30] his ministry the lord takes the seals
[11:32] off and unseals the bible for us so that
[11:34] we can look back down through and we can
[11:36] see that the bible's been christ amen
[11:38] it's been the revelation of jesus christ
[11:41] which christ is the mystery of god
[11:43] revealed but through that revelation of
[11:46] christ down through there there's been a
[11:47] revealing of male and female all the way
[11:49] down through
[11:51] and so we want to look into the
[11:52] scripture again and take the subject the
[11:54] contrast in queens
[11:57] because we know that christ is a king
[11:59] but that king will have a queen
[12:02] and in the message modern events are
[12:04] made clear by prophecy brother venom
[12:06] says rebecca didn't wait to get the
[12:08] second order they asked her said will
[12:10] you go
[12:11] let her say let her say she said i'll go
[12:14] she was firmly inspired of god she
[12:16] became one of the queens of the bible
[12:18] for acting upon the pulsation of the
[12:20] spirit of god that moved upon her to
[12:22] receive what was absolutely the truth
[12:25] and she believed it so brother branham
[12:27] calls her one of the queens of the bible
[12:29] so when i start talking about the
[12:30] contrast in queens i'm not talking about
[12:33] and maybe just necessarily queen sitting
[12:35] on the throne but these characters in
[12:37] the bible these ladies in the bible that
[12:39] brother ben calls a queen he calls sarah
[12:41] a queen
[12:42] of the bible he calls rebecca a queen
[12:45] but we know there was
[12:47] the bible is so good at at
[12:50] it's it's so perfect in displaying the
[12:53] very mind of god but it's so hidden in
[12:56] the stories and hidden in the details
[12:58] but when the seals come off you look
[13:00] back down through and you see the very
[13:02] nature and very plan of god because when
[13:04] you look down through the bible you see
[13:06] these queens of the old testament that
[13:08] were coming through in sarah and in
[13:10] rebecca and and all these ones that were
[13:12] coming through all the way up to literal
[13:14] queens amen
[13:15] in the kingdom of david but you'll also
[13:18] see evil queens as well and you see a
[13:20] contrast between the two natures and
[13:23] when you look at these queens in the old
[13:24] testament amen you're looking at the
[13:26] false and the true vine the false woman
[13:28] and the true woman the false church and
[13:31] the true church
[13:32] and it's coming all the way down through
[13:34] from genesis all the way through the
[13:36] bible amen this is not a new testament
[13:39] concept or just an end time concept this
[13:41] has been playing itself out all the way
[13:44] through the bible god has been showing
[13:46] and revealing amen the path the two
[13:48] vines the the two types of women amen
[13:51] the king he's been showing all of this
[13:53] all through the bible
[13:55] and now when the seals are taken off our
[13:57] bible is constantly becoming a new
[14:00] book so let's turn to esther this is an
[14:03] obvious one where we can easily get the
[14:05] contrast we know this really well but i
[14:07] just want to spend a few minutes in
[14:09] esther and then move on
[14:12] esther chapter one
[14:17] verse 9
[14:18] esther chapter 1 verse 9
[14:23] also vasti the queen made a feast for
[14:25] the women in the royal house which
[14:27] belongeth the king
[14:28] ahyseras so we know the king is now
[14:32] having a feast to show off his splendor
[14:34] and the greatness of his kingdom he's
[14:35] invited everybody to this feast and
[14:38] vashti now is having a feast for the
[14:41] women and so now she's she's separated
[14:44] out the women to herself and vashti is
[14:46] very much a type of the catholic church
[14:48] and now she's got a feast of the women
[14:50] which is the ecumenical move the the
[14:52] catholic church with all the other
[14:54] churches over here together and so she
[14:57] has her own thing going and then in
[14:59] chapter 10 it says on the seventh day
[15:03] seventh day
[15:04] seventh age
[15:06] on the seventh day
[15:07] when the heart of the king was merry
[15:09] with wine he commanded the all these
[15:12] guys with these names i don't know if i
[15:14] can pronounce them all but there's seven
[15:16] of them so on the seventh day we have
[15:20] seven princes amen we have seven men uh
[15:23] the chamberlain's which are typing the
[15:25] seven church age messengers and these
[15:27] seven chamberlains that served in the
[15:29] presence of azaris the king to bring
[15:32] vashti the queen before the king with
[15:34] the crown royal to show the people and
[15:36] the princes her beauty for she was fair
[15:39] to look on but the queen vashti refused
[15:42] to come at the king's commandment by his
[15:44] chamberlain's therefore was the king
[15:47] very roth and his anger burned in him
[15:51] amen so now we find out in the seventh
[15:53] day of this great feast amen vashti and
[15:56] vashti means beautiful the name the
[15:59] meaning of her name is beautiful so this
[16:01] beautiful queen and the feast of women
[16:03] amen is doing her own thing while the
[16:06] king is having his his feast and after
[16:08] seven days he sends the seven
[16:10] chamberlains or the seven angels after
[16:13] to gather the woman unto himself into
[16:15] this great feast and she refuses to come
[16:18] because here in the seventh day in the
[16:20] seventh age god amen has sent a message
[16:23] of all seven church ages all the
[16:25] revelation wrapped up in one and he
[16:27] brought that message to all the church
[16:29] and they refused it
[16:31] they refused to come amen and so she she
[16:35] refused the commandment of the king she
[16:37] refused the word of the seven
[16:39] chamberlains amen to come and she stayed
[16:42] with her feast of women
[16:45] so she was refused
[16:48] brother branham says in the message god
[16:50] hiding himself in simplicity now i think
[16:52] it's our duty to make the inside right
[16:54] by the grace of god to be so grateful to
[16:57] god
[16:58] this will just not only be a beautiful
[17:00] building he's talking about the
[17:01] dedication of the
[17:03] of the tabernacle after the expansion
[17:05] and remodel this will just not only be a
[17:07] beautiful building that will come to but
[17:09] may everyone who comes in see the
[17:11] beautiful characteristic of jesus christ
[17:14] in every person that comes in
[17:16] may it be a consecrated place to our
[17:19] lord a consecrated people for no matter
[17:21] how beautiful the structure is that we
[17:24] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[17:26] the church is the character of the
[17:27] people i trust it'll always be a house
[17:30] of god of beauty
[17:32] so here vashti's name was beautiful she
[17:35] had a beautiful exterior amen but she
[17:38] had an ugly interior
[17:41] because she was beautiful to look upon
[17:43] her name means beautiful she was told
[17:45] that she was fair he wanted her to come
[17:47] for all to see because she was fair to
[17:49] look upon amen but but she didn't have
[17:53] the beautiful character of christ amen
[17:55] so she refused the king
[17:57] but brother branham was saying what we
[17:58] want is the beautiful characteristic of
[18:02] jesus christ and every person that comes
[18:05] in
[18:07] in the message the marriage of the lamb
[18:09] he says esther purged her heart before
[18:11] god
[18:12] walked up with a meek and humble spirit
[18:15] the church that's going to be the bride
[18:16] of christ now remember so brother
[18:18] branham is now typing esther with the
[18:20] bride of christ and he says esther
[18:23] walked up with a meek and humble spirit
[18:25] she had a completely different nature
[18:27] than what vashtihan
[18:31] now remember esther refused the worldly
[18:33] adornment she took the spirit in her
[18:35] heart to go before the king
[18:38] and the women today the church that
[18:40] thinks she's going to get in because
[18:42] she's got more numbers she's the best
[18:44] dressed crowd she's got the biggest
[18:46] organization the biggest church in the
[18:48] city and things like that you'll miss it
[18:51] a million miles if you're depending on
[18:53] that it's a sweet kind reverent spirit
[18:57] to the word of god washed by the water
[18:59] of the word and the word in you it's a
[19:02] washing
[19:03] so brother brahms typing esther's nature
[19:06] amen with that of the bride of christ
[19:08] and esther come with meekness and
[19:10] sweetness amen before the king and she
[19:13] didn't take any of the worldly adornment
[19:15] according to the prophet of god and we
[19:17] know we've been through this many times
[19:19] so we're just going to hit these points
[19:20] and move but but we know that she was
[19:22] under the care of haggai the keeper of
[19:24] the women the chamberlain to prepare
[19:26] them for their for their meeting with
[19:28] the king and in that preparation she
[19:30] went through a purification and and she
[19:32] was she was washed she was clean she was
[19:34] purified under the ministry of haggai
[19:37] and the ministry of haggai very much
[19:39] types the ministry of brother phantom in
[19:40] our day
[19:42] and under that ministry she was purified
[19:44] amen she was washed she was clean she
[19:46] was purified then she received the
[19:49] ointments and and the haggai appointed
[19:51] unto her certain things that she needed
[19:54] amen when she went before the king amen
[19:57] and that says in esther that when the
[19:59] women when it was their turn to come to
[20:00] the king amen they could take anything
[20:03] that they desired
[20:05] amen it's it and we've talked about this
[20:08] many times don't know this is new but we
[20:10] live in we live in a laodicean world in
[20:13] a laodicean condition amen and we've got
[20:16] everything we desire at our fingertips
[20:18] and we can bring any of it into our
[20:20] worship that we want to
[20:22] god we're not in the age where i mean we
[20:25] travel by horseback or foot and we come
[20:27] to church and we we have a limited
[20:30] exposure to limited things and no no
[20:33] opportunity to expose ourselves we can
[20:35] be exposed to anything we want to be
[20:37] exposed to at any time and we can take
[20:39] part in any pleasure that we desire to
[20:41] take part in amen and we can bring that
[20:43] in to our worship bring it into our
[20:46] lives if we want to but it says of
[20:48] esther esther when it was her turn she
[20:52] only took what haggai required amen what
[20:55] he had appointed and nothing more amen
[20:58] so she went to the king amen fully
[21:01] prepared by haggai not with her own mind
[21:04] her own thinking or anything of the
[21:06] world or the influence of any of the
[21:07] other virgins
[21:10] she didn't take the influence you know
[21:12] obviously some probably got to go before
[21:15] her and some were planning to go after
[21:16] her and she would see what they would
[21:18] take and then they would choose this
[21:20] adornment and this perfume and this and
[21:22] whatever they they chose amen but she
[21:24] didn't let any of that influence her she
[21:26] was only influenced by the ministry of
[21:28] haggai
[21:31] and it was showing listen when we look
[21:33] at esther we look at how she submitted
[21:36] to the ministry of haggai amen and she
[21:38] only took what he required and he had
[21:40] appointed
[21:42] it shows that she has the very character
[21:45] of humility and submission
[21:49] the king had vashti who was beautiful
[21:52] and fair to look upon but she was
[21:54] self-willed
[21:56] and so because of her self-will amen she
[22:00] was refused and she was rejected amen
[22:02] but now esther is going to be brought on
[22:04] the scene and esther is brought in and
[22:07] accepted and esther's acceptance amen is
[22:10] based on how she presented herself to
[22:12] the king and she presented herself
[22:15] solely based on the influence of hackie
[22:17] eye
[22:19] so it was showing listen it was showing
[22:22] and depicting
[22:24] her character
[22:26] when she come to the king she had the
[22:28] character of gentleness meekness
[22:31] and submission
[22:34] the king didn't want just another
[22:36] beautiful woman
[22:39] that didn't work
[22:40] we come to the end time god doesn't want
[22:42] just another nice church another good
[22:45] system another beautiful organization
[22:48] that hasn't worked
[22:50] god wants character amen he's looking
[22:53] for character that will reflect his own
[22:55] nature he's looking for somebody amen
[22:57] that'll stay submissive to the ministry
[22:59] of haggai in our day and surrender their
[23:02] own thinking and when everybody else
[23:03] thinks amen and just listen to what
[23:05] haggai is saying and present themselves
[23:07] to the king the way haggai says you
[23:10] ought to be presented to the king
[23:12] amen
[23:14] so let's turn to esther chapter seven
[23:17] we're not going to go deep into this i
[23:18] just want to hit a couple points and
[23:20] then move on
[23:23] esther chapter 7
[23:25] and we all know the story we're very
[23:27] very familiar with the story of how how
[23:29] esther his life is now in jeopardy and
[23:31] all the lives of the jews is in jeopardy
[23:33] because of
[23:34] because of haman and his scheme and the
[23:37] deception that he's brought and now it
[23:39] is it is up to her amen to try to bring
[23:43] salvation to her people amen and now she
[23:46] is the queen she has been chosen and
[23:48] then she's taken vashti's place amen but
[23:51] she she's taken vashti's place but she's
[23:54] never taken vashti's attitude
[23:57] she takes vashti's place but she never
[23:59] mimics vashti's character she always
[24:02] stays meek and submissive and humble
[24:06] remember when it was time for her to go
[24:09] in first to the king amen she hadn't
[24:11] been summoned she hadn't been called
[24:13] amen and she was going to go try to talk
[24:16] to the king and she was going to invite
[24:18] him to the banquet of wine because she
[24:20] wants to talk to him about this need
[24:22] that she has amen and look how she
[24:25] presents herself and then she asks
[24:28] mordecai and all the people outside to
[24:30] pray and fast with her she will pray and
[24:33] fast amen all of her mains will pray and
[24:35] fast then she'll put on all the royal
[24:38] garment that was appointed by the king
[24:40] and put on all the royal garment and
[24:42] then she will enter in and when she
[24:44] enters in she comes in neatly she comes
[24:47] in submissive she comes in humbly
[24:51] she doesn't put on the royal garment
[24:52] comes stomping in and say you know
[24:54] what's going on and you know what
[24:57] what haman's doing and you know this and
[24:58] you know that
[25:00] but look at esther's approach to the
[25:03] king
[25:05] she approaches the king submissively she
[25:07] approaches the king humbly she honors
[25:11] and reverences the king and because of
[25:13] her approach to the king the king
[25:15] receives esther's advance and and puts
[25:19] forth the scepter and she comes and
[25:20] touches the scepter she's received
[25:23] and when she comes she doesn't just
[25:25] start start staking her needs and making
[25:29] demands and you must do this and you
[25:31] must do that so when she comes to the
[25:33] king and the king accept her he says
[25:35] what is it you want and she says i want
[25:37] you to come to my place and i want to
[25:40] entertain you
[25:42] i want to treat you amen i want to
[25:44] entertain you amen and there's such an
[25:47] approach and esther there's such a
[25:49] something that we can learn amen that we
[25:52] we approach god and i think sometimes uh
[25:56] to me this is just me this is just
[25:57] brother chan i think sometimes we talk
[26:00] about god into god in too familiar away
[26:03] like he's a buddy and forget that he's
[26:05] the creator of all heavens and earth
[26:08] and almost make demands like like he's
[26:12] our genie in a bottle
[26:15] god fix this for me and fix that for me
[26:17] and fix it of course he wants us to come
[26:19] and of course he wants us amen to to cry
[26:21] out to him in need and pray to him but i
[26:24] i what if we can mimic esther's approach
[26:27] and come with humility and reverence and
[26:29] understand who it is we're speaking to
[26:31] at all times
[26:33] amen that's why i say so many of these
[26:37] new songs that that you hear sung in in
[26:40] christian circles there's so much like a
[26:43] boyfriend girlfriend love song
[26:46] and it's putting me in christ on equal
[26:49] levels and and he's my boyfriend and my
[26:51] best bud and him and i are chumming
[26:53] around and maybe they don't use those
[26:55] words but that's the attitude of the
[26:57] song and i don't like that i think
[26:59] worship should always be up amen it
[27:01] should always be directed to one that's
[27:02] higher than i now there's always should
[27:04] be a bowing before the greater one than
[27:07] i and humility and a reverence and our
[27:09] worship should always be directed up not
[27:12] lateral but higher
[27:14] and some of these you know this ultra
[27:16] familiarity
[27:18] hey it to me it just doesn't set well
[27:21] amen i think we should worship a god a
[27:24] mighty god a savior amen and our worship
[27:27] should be in humility and reverence and
[27:29] respect for this god
[27:31] so esther really shows us amen the
[27:34] approach and shows us the right
[27:36] character
[27:37] in in esther chapter 7
[27:40] verse 1
[27:42] so so the king and haman came to
[27:44] to banquet with esther the queen and the
[27:46] queen said again and to esther on the
[27:48] second day at the banquet of wine what
[27:51] is thy petition queen esther and it
[27:53] shall be granted thee and what is thy
[27:55] request and it shall be performed even
[27:57] to half of the kingdom now look at what
[27:59] this woman has the opportunity to ask
[28:02] for
[28:03] he said what's your petition what's your
[28:05] request i'll give you everything up to
[28:07] half the kingdom now esther does not
[28:11] have a greedy nature
[28:13] she's not coming
[28:15] to him to get a bunch of things
[28:19] or half the kingdom she comes because
[28:21] she wants life
[28:24] verse 3 then esther the queen answered
[28:26] and said if i have found favor in thy
[28:27] sido king
[28:29] and if it pleased the king let my life
[28:31] be given me at my petition in my people
[28:33] at my request
[28:35] for you were sold i and my people to be
[28:37] destroyed to be slain and to perish
[28:40] but if we had been sold for bond men and
[28:43] bond women i had held my tongue
[28:46] although the enemy could not countervail
[28:47] the king's damage
[28:50] then king azaris answered and said unto
[28:52] esther the queen who is he and where is
[28:55] he that durst presume in his heart to do
[28:58] so and esther said the adversary and
[29:01] enemy is this wicked haman then haman
[29:04] was afraid before the king and the queen
[29:07] so esther
[29:09] i just wanna if i can use this to start
[29:11] to paint a picture esther is coming in
[29:14] reverence and submission and humility to
[29:16] the king and she's making her request i
[29:18] want my life and she's saying if we had
[29:21] even been sold just into slavery as bond
[29:23] women and bomb i wouldn't have even said
[29:25] anything although you know whoever did
[29:27] it would have you to deal with
[29:29] that's what she's saying
[29:31] but i'm just saying it because it's
[29:33] serious and we need your help and and he
[29:36] says who is this and she says it's this
[29:37] wicked haman and i i like to see that i
[29:41] use this terminology and use this as an
[29:43] example because esther is not weak
[29:46] esther is strong
[29:49] esther is bold esther is able to conquer
[29:52] her fears esther is able to move when
[29:54] others can't move amen esther was the
[29:57] one who went into the king unbidden
[30:00] because it was needful and she saw the
[30:02] need esther is brave esther is bold
[30:05] esther is
[30:06] strong when you read the story you find
[30:09] this is not
[30:11] meek is not weak
[30:14] humble amen is not weakness amen it's a
[30:18] display of respect and honor and
[30:20] understanding of who you are and who
[30:22] you're in the presence with because when
[30:24] the when when as arias ask her amen who
[30:28] is this she says there's this wicked
[30:29] haman she wasn't afraid of haman she was
[30:32] bold enough to call him out amen but
[30:34] when she spoke to the king she was
[30:36] respectful and gave honor to the king
[30:39] so this esther is not weak
[30:43] vashti was not strong and esther weak
[30:46] but rather reversed vashti was weak and
[30:50] esther was strong
[30:53] i hope we'll see that as we go on
[30:55] so let's jump over to first kings
[31:01] and we're going to spend some time in a
[31:03] little bit of a bible study keep your
[31:04] bibles handy we'll flip to a few
[31:07] scriptures here because i want to
[31:09] see some things together
[31:14] first kings 16.
[31:24] first kings 16
[31:26] and 29
[31:30] and in the thirty and eighth year of asa
[31:32] king of judah began ahab the son of omri
[31:34] to reign over israel
[31:36] and ahab the son of omri reigned over
[31:38] israel in samaria twenty and two years
[31:41] and ahab the son of omri did evil in the
[31:43] sight of the lord above all that were
[31:45] before him
[31:47] and it came and it came to pass as if it
[31:49] had been a light thing for him to walk
[31:51] on the sins of jeroboam the son of nebot
[31:54] that he took to wife jezebel the
[31:56] daughter of ethbale king of the
[31:57] zedonians and went and served baal and
[32:00] worshiped him
[32:02] and he reared up an altar
[32:04] for baal in the house of baal which he
[32:06] had built in samaria and they have made
[32:08] a grove and ahab did more to provoke the
[32:10] lord god of israel to anger than all the
[32:13] kings of israel that were before him
[32:16] we're going to start speaking about
[32:17] jezebel now as one of these queens in
[32:20] the bible and and we all know she's not
[32:22] our good example of a queen like esther
[32:24] was but she's been used throughout the
[32:26] bible as a as a as a something that's
[32:29] atrocious or loathsome in a woman amen
[32:32] and so she's the wrong type of woman
[32:33] she's the wrong type of queen
[32:36] but but i just want to brother frank if
[32:38] you could pull up the white board for me
[32:40] i just want to take a look at a few
[32:42] scriptures and i want to show where
[32:44] jezebel comes from amen and this is a
[32:46] little bit of a rabbit trail but if
[32:48] you'll let me take just a short rabbit
[32:49] trail i think it'll help us amen because
[32:52] aham
[32:53] the the lord became so angry with ahab
[32:57] uh
[32:58] because of
[32:59] ahab he says as if it was a light thing
[33:02] that he walked in the sins of of
[33:04] jeroboam what jeroboam did was set up
[33:06] the two golden calves amen to keep the
[33:09] 10 tribes of israel from going back into
[33:11] jerusalem and worshipping at the temple
[33:14] so he set up the two golden calves one
[33:16] and dan and one in ephraim and set up an
[33:18] idolatry and a false worship to keep the
[33:21] ten tribes to himself to keep them from
[33:23] returning back to jerusalem so they
[33:25] wouldn't go back amen to the house of
[33:27] david
[33:28] and so he said that ahab was continuing
[33:31] this and it says as if it was a light
[33:33] thing
[33:35] and it came to pass verse 31 as if it
[33:37] had been a light thing for him to walk
[33:39] in the sins of jeroboam the son of neba
[33:42] that he took to wife jezebel so now this
[33:45] he's first offended that he stays in
[33:47] this in this idolatry but on top of that
[33:51] worse than that as if this was a light
[33:52] thing he took jezebel to be a wife
[33:55] and god was so angry with this and then
[33:58] he begins to worship baal and brother
[34:00] banh tells us ahab was not that bad of a
[34:02] guy but it was the influence of his wife
[34:05] that corrupted him and moved him amen
[34:07] into the worship of baal
[34:09] so i want to take a minute and look at
[34:12] and look at this
[34:15] so we have ahab
[34:22] ahab and jezebel
[34:27] now jezebel comes
[34:30] from ethbale
[34:34] oh
[34:35] not right
[34:38] jezebel comes from i'll just write it
[34:40] over here
[34:43] fbale
[34:47] right do i got that right
[34:49] is that his name
[34:51] let me see it
[34:53] yeah ethbale king of the zedonians
[34:57] so he is the king
[35:01] of the zidonians
[35:04] so the zedonians are from zidane
[35:07] or
[35:08] sidon
[35:09] it's both ways in the bible it's the
[35:11] same city it's a city-state and he's the
[35:14] king of that and ahab is is now marrying
[35:17] jezebel this is very much a political
[35:20] alliance amen so he's marrying a
[35:23] princess her father is the king of the
[35:25] zidonians the zidonians are just north
[35:28] amen of the of the land of of ahab and
[35:31] omri uh ahab's dad started to make
[35:34] alliances with these people and as he
[35:36] was starting making alliances and
[35:38] agreements and treat treaties with them
[35:40] now ahab becomes king and he goes up and
[35:43] takes the the king of the zidonian's uh
[35:46] daughter and brings her down and marries
[35:48] her and she she is a phoenician and they
[35:51] are caught in baal worship and he comes
[35:52] and he joins together with her for
[35:54] political gain amen and this becomes a
[35:57] corruption that sets in so jezebel came
[36:01] from zidane or sidon let's turn to
[36:04] joshua
[36:06] if you with me joshua 19.
[36:13] and let's find out where all this comes
[36:15] from
[36:17] joshua 19
[36:22] and 24.
[36:27] joshua is now dividing up by lot to the
[36:30] children of israel their portion of the
[36:32] land that they're to go and conquer amen
[36:35] and they will become their inheritance
[36:36] their land and in verse 24 says and the
[36:39] fifth lot came out for the tribe of the
[36:41] children of asher according to their
[36:44] families
[36:45] and their border was
[36:47] hellcath and haley and bitten and
[36:50] akshath and
[36:51] alamelek
[36:55] and reaches to carmel westward in the
[36:58] shoreline and turn it toward this uh sun
[37:02] rising and beth dagon and reaches
[37:04] zebulun into the valley of jephthah l
[37:07] toward the north side of bethemek and
[37:10] neil and goethe out to
[37:12] kabul and on to the left hand
[37:14] and hebron and rehab and haman and cana
[37:18] even unto great zidane
[37:22] okay
[37:23] so asher is supposed to take possession
[37:25] of zidane that's their lot that's their
[37:27] portion
[37:29] and then the coast turneth
[37:32] to rhema and to the strong city of tyre
[37:34] and the coast turneth to hesa and the
[37:36] outgoings thereof are from the sea from
[37:38] the coast to akzib uma also in apec and
[37:42] rehab 20 and two cities with their
[37:44] villages this is the inheritance of the
[37:46] tribe of the children of asher according
[37:48] to their families these cities with
[37:50] their villages
[37:52] so when they first come into the land
[37:53] under the promise that they're given
[37:55] moses brings them in exodus and then
[37:57] moses is taken away now joshua is taking
[37:59] them into the land amen and in the land
[38:02] they're dividing up the land to the
[38:04] tribes and the tribes are supposed to go
[38:06] in by the commandment of god and they're
[38:08] supposed to drive out the inhabitants
[38:09] and take possession of the land
[38:11] and asher's job is to take this lot this
[38:15] portion on the northern end of israel
[38:17] and drive out the habitants and take
[38:19] possession of the land amen
[38:22] let's go to judges chapter 1.
[38:30] verse 31
[38:38] and judges 131
[38:40] neither did asher drive out the
[38:42] inhabitants
[38:43] of octjo
[38:44] nor the inhabitants
[38:46] nor the inhabitants of zidane
[38:48] nor of elab nor of exhib nor of helba
[38:52] nor of
[38:53] afic nor of rehab but the asherites
[38:56] dwelt among the canaanites the
[38:58] inhabitants of the land for they did not
[39:00] drive them out
[39:04] see
[39:05] one generation's compromise and fail to
[39:08] keep the word always leads to something
[39:11] bad
[39:12] and the bible includes all of these
[39:14] things so we can go back and look at
[39:16] this and realize asher could not drive
[39:19] out on the inhabitants so what asher did
[39:22] is begin to put the canaanites under
[39:23] tribute and then they begin to dwell
[39:25] with the canaanites now they had the
[39:27] canaanites subdued they had the
[39:29] canaanites amen they were under pressure
[39:32] they were under tribute they were
[39:33] subdued but they were not driven out
[39:35] amen and if asher had done what god told
[39:38] asher to do there would be no king of
[39:40] the zedonians there would be no jezebel
[39:43] there would be no wicked evil witch of a
[39:45] queen in in israel
[39:50] so you can see how partial obedience
[39:52] compromise and disobedience is the thing
[39:55] that's been the affliction all through
[39:57] the bible it starts all the way back in
[39:59] the garden of eden and it continues all
[40:01] the way through and god has written it
[40:03] so clear and left it there so that we
[40:05] can always go back and recognize amen
[40:08] brother benham said one word
[40:11] one word caused the ruin and a fall of
[40:14] all of humanity and the ruination of the
[40:16] earth one word how will we get back
[40:19] doubting one word amen this is the age
[40:21] where we come back to the full
[40:22] revelation of the full truth of god and
[40:24] there must be a people on the earth that
[40:26] will say not again amen not this time
[40:29] but if god will help me i'll give my
[40:30] whole self to this word
[40:33] because compromise partial obedience
[40:36] amen is always been the ruination
[40:41] so if asher had done what they were
[40:44] commissioned to do
[40:46] there would be no jezebel
[40:50] now where did sidon come from let's go
[40:52] to genesis chapter 10.
[40:55] let's see why this is so
[40:58] still so terrible
[41:10] genesis chapter 10
[41:12] verse 6.
[41:17] we're talking after the flood the
[41:19] genealogies of noah we came to 10 6 and
[41:22] the sons of ham
[41:24] cush
[41:25] and mizrahim and foot and canaan and out
[41:27] of canaan comes all the canaanites all
[41:30] right so let's go down to verse 15.
[41:33] and caden begot sidon
[41:37] sidon
[41:39] that's where zidan sidon the zedonians
[41:43] come from they come from the accursed
[41:45] canaan because canaan was cursed by noah
[41:48] so the the curse was on canaan one of
[41:51] caden's children his side and sidon is
[41:53] the the the the son of canaan the
[41:57] inhabitants of zion become the zidonians
[41:59] amen so
[42:01] jezebel comes from the accursed canaan
[42:05] everything is linked friends
[42:08] that's why there's got to be a people
[42:10] that can be washed by the word in this
[42:12] day and stay under that word to wash all
[42:14] of this stuff away
[42:17] because man has proved he cannot do it
[42:19] so now that curse on canaan comes down
[42:21] to side and sidon and zidane are the
[42:23] same thing become the zidonians now
[42:25] there's a king there when asher comes in
[42:27] he's supposed to drive them all out and
[42:29] get that cursed nation those cursed
[42:32] people out of god's land and they failed
[42:35] to do it and when they failed to do it
[42:36] he said they'll become a prick in thy
[42:38] eyes and a thorn in thy flesh and that's
[42:40] exactly what happens when jezebel comes
[42:42] and unites with ahab
[42:46] amen
[42:49] now let's look at jezebel in first kings
[42:51] chapter 21.
[43:03] now first kings 21
[43:06] and 1. first kings 21-1
[43:09] let's just look at the character and
[43:10] nature of jezebel
[43:15] and it came to pass after these things
[43:17] that naboth the jezreelite had a
[43:19] vineyard which was in jezreel hard by
[43:22] the palace of ahab king of samaria
[43:25] and they have spoken to nabath saying
[43:27] give me thy thy vineyard that i make
[43:30] have it for a garden of herbs because it
[43:31] is near into my house and i will give
[43:34] thee for it a better vineyard than it or
[43:36] if it seemed good to thee i will give it
[43:37] the
[43:39] the worth of it and money and nabath
[43:41] said to ahab the lord forbid it me that
[43:44] i should give the inheritance of my
[43:45] fathers unto thee what is naboth doing
[43:48] is naboth greedy is navastinji no naboth
[43:52] is sticking with the word
[43:54] because the word was this is the
[43:56] inheritance for the you and for your
[43:58] children hereafter he was staying in the
[44:01] line of the word because he was staying
[44:03] in the inheritance of his father here
[44:05] somebody wanted him to sell out for gain
[44:08] for better vineyard or for more money
[44:11] wants him to leave the word the portion
[44:13] of the word for his day his allotted
[44:15] portion and go something for something
[44:17] better or for money
[44:19] but here he is wanting to stay with the
[44:21] word the inheritance of my father amen
[44:24] and so naboth is a righteous man
[44:28] in verse four and
[44:30] ahab came into his house heavy and
[44:32] displeased because of the word which
[44:34] naboth the jezreelite has spoke to him
[44:37] for had said i will not give thee the
[44:39] inheritance of my father's and he laid
[44:41] him down upon his bed and turned away
[44:43] his face and would eat no bread
[44:45] but jezebel his wife came to him and
[44:48] said unto him why is thy spirit so sad
[44:50] that thou eat us no bread
[44:52] and he said unto her because i spake
[44:54] unto naboth the jezreelite and he said
[44:55] unto me to him and i said unto him give
[44:58] me thy vineyard for money or else if it
[45:00] please thee i will give thee another
[45:02] vineyard for it and he answered and will
[45:04] not give i will not give thee my
[45:06] vineyard
[45:08] and jezebel's wife said unto him dost
[45:10] thou now govern the kingdom of israel
[45:12] arise and eat bread and let thine heart
[45:14] be merry i will give thee the vineyard
[45:16] of nabath the jezreelite
[45:20] so she wrote letters in ahab's name and
[45:22] sealed them with his seal and sent the
[45:24] letters into the elders into the nobles
[45:26] that were in his in a city dwelling with
[45:29] naboth and she wrote in the letters
[45:31] saying proclaim a fast and set nabath on
[45:33] high among the people and set two men
[45:36] sons of below before him to bear witness
[45:38] against him saying thou didst blaspheme
[45:40] god and the king
[45:42] and then carry him out and stone him
[45:43] that he may die
[45:45] and the men of the city even the elders
[45:47] and the nobles who were the inhabitants
[45:48] of the city did as jezebel had sent unto
[45:51] them and as it was written in the
[45:53] letters which she had sent unto them
[45:55] they proclaimed the fast and set neboth
[45:58] on high among the people and there came
[46:00] in two men of children of belial and sat
[46:03] before him and the men of belial
[46:04] witnessed against him even against
[46:06] naboth and the presence of the people
[46:08] saying naboth did blaspheme god and the
[46:10] king
[46:11] then they carried him forth out of the
[46:13] city and stoned him with stones that he
[46:15] died
[46:16] then they sent to jezebel saying naboth
[46:18] is stoned and is dead and it came to
[46:21] pass when jezebel heard that naboth was
[46:23] stoned and was dead that jezebel said to
[46:26] ahab arise take possession of the
[46:28] vineyard and naboth the jezreelite which
[46:31] he refused to give thee for money for
[46:32] naboth is not alive
[46:34] but dead
[46:37] this has been jezebel's tactic ever
[46:39] since and the jezebel religion has done
[46:41] the same thing
[46:43] spiritually
[46:44] to anyone who wanted to stay with the
[46:46] word
[46:48] see we're looking at a contrast in
[46:50] characters
[46:52] jezebel is self-willed
[46:54] jezebel is conniving manipulating
[46:57] politically motivated
[47:00] this is not the nature we know she's not
[47:02] got the right nature anybody in the
[47:04] world knows jezebel's not the right
[47:05] nature but she she's displaying the
[47:08] nature of the false church amen amen and
[47:10] god has other women like esther
[47:13] displaying the nature of the true church
[47:14] and bride of jesus christ and when we
[47:16] look at these things it's more than just
[47:18] stories because we want to look at that
[47:20] and say if i ever start to need to
[47:22] manipulate a situation i'm already
[47:24] moving the wrong way
[47:26] if i have to become dishonest amen to
[47:29] push an agenda forward if i have to
[47:31] become politically motivated in the
[47:33] church amen instantly when i begin to do
[47:36] those things i'm now i'm now replicating
[47:38] the false vine and the false woman amen
[47:41] because all i need to do is humble
[47:42] myself under the word and approach my
[47:44] god with humility and sincerity and
[47:47] reverence to him and tell him my need
[47:50] and let him decide what needs to be done
[47:54] not go and tell him you need to do this
[47:56] and you need to do this and you need to
[47:58] do that esther never come and said do
[48:00] this do this do that she said i'm just
[48:01] asking for my life
[48:04] it was up the king and we know later as
[48:06] she progressed amen through there the
[48:08] king would say now what do you want
[48:12] esther never said i want this i want
[48:14] this i want this she never says doing
[48:16] and shush on the palace today as we did
[48:18] yesterday and hang the ten sons of haman
[48:20] she didn't do that of her own accord
[48:22] amen when the king looked at her and
[48:24] gave the report and says now what more
[48:26] would you want
[48:28] and she answered
[48:30] esther is always under headship esther
[48:33] is always submissive to the king the
[48:35] king she will not just demand but the
[48:37] king will ask and then she'll tell
[48:40] but jezebel's not under any headships
[48:43] she's taking headship she's taking
[48:45] dominion she's become dominating
[48:47] esther's never becoming dominating
[48:50] but esther is not weak
[48:54] you can see esther is not passive amen
[48:56] because when he says what do you want
[48:58] done do today like we did yesterday and
[49:00] hang the tents on she's not weak she's
[49:02] not passive amen she knows what needs to
[49:05] be done amen and she knows amen where
[49:07] the evil is and how to correct it but
[49:09] she's not making demands and she's not
[49:11] making it happen
[49:15] see
[49:15] you can say these are stories in the
[49:17] bible but it comes down to our personal
[49:19] lives amen when we're trying to get
[49:21] something done in a workplace in a
[49:23] church environment and a family and we
[49:25] have to become manipulative and
[49:27] deceiving and political amen you're
[49:29] emulating the wrong character that's the
[49:32] nature of lucifer that has come down
[49:34] through canaan amen that has come down
[49:36] to jezebel
[49:41] but when we can go to god with reverence
[49:43] and humility and sincerity and say lord
[49:46] i know you're god and you construct all
[49:48] things and you ordain all things and i'm
[49:50] happy but lord there's a need that i
[49:52] have here there's a conflict there's a
[49:54] something going on i'm asking you lord
[49:56] just to help me
[49:58] i'm asking you to take care of it and
[50:00] then let god work it out amen let god do
[50:03] the thing
[50:05] you can see the two different natures
[50:07] and in christ amen this is the time of
[50:10] of of of the nature of christ being
[50:12] displayed in his blind bride she is
[50:15] becoming the actual reflection of the
[50:17] character of christ on this earth so it
[50:20] matters how she reflects that character
[50:22] in every conversation and every day of
[50:24] her life
[50:28] praise be to god
[50:31] brother benham says in the church age
[50:33] book on the th and the thyatiran church
[50:34] age
[50:35] he said it is most worthy of note that
[50:37] the very name thyatira means dominating
[50:40] female
[50:41] thus this age is characterized by a
[50:44] dominant force a force that ruthlessly
[50:47] invades all conquers all and
[50:49] despotically controls now a dominating
[50:51] female is the greatest curse in the
[50:53] world
[50:55] so the prophet said
[50:57] why he's going all the way back in the
[51:00] bible brother bran is not just making a
[51:02] statement based off his opinion he's
[51:04] looking all the way back to characters
[51:05] like jezebel like vashti like like all
[51:08] the others amen it's a curse that
[51:10] dominating female spirit is a curse
[51:13] let's go to to revelation chapter
[51:16] three
[51:18] or maybe two let me look and see
[51:21] yeah i think it's revelation chapter 2.
[51:26] yeah revelation chapter 2 verse 18
[51:35] and unto the angel of the church and
[51:37] thyatira write these things saith the
[51:39] son of god who hath his eye like unto a
[51:41] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[51:43] brass i know thy works and thy charity
[51:46] and service and faith and thy patience
[51:48] and thy works and at last to be more
[51:50] than the first
[51:51] notwithstanding i have a few things
[51:53] against thee because thou suffers that
[51:55] woman jezebel
[51:57] brother ben says the name thyatira means
[51:59] dominating female
[52:01] and under the under the the the
[52:05] the speech he gives to the thyatiran
[52:07] church age he says you suffered that
[52:09] woman jezebel
[52:10] which call of herself a prophetess to
[52:12] teach and to seduce my servants to to
[52:15] commit fornication and to eat things
[52:17] sacrificed in the idols so brother
[52:18] brahms he goes so clear and tells us
[52:20] this is the rise of the catholic church
[52:22] this is the wrong church coming into
[52:24] play in this age
[52:26] and he says verse 21 and i gave her
[52:28] space to repent of her fornication and
[52:30] she repented not behold i will cast her
[52:32] into a bed and them that commit adultery
[52:35] with her into great tribulation except
[52:37] they repent of their deeds and i will
[52:39] kill her children with death and all the
[52:41] churches shall know that i am he which
[52:44] searcheth the reigns and hearts and i
[52:45] will give
[52:46] unto every one of you according to your
[52:48] works
[52:49] so he's going to cast her
[52:52] and her children
[52:54] to death
[52:55] to a bed of tribulation and to death so
[52:58] hold on to that and we'll get back to
[53:00] that statement
[53:02] further on in the thiatian church age he
[53:04] says in this thiatar and church age she
[53:06] is she is a dominating female she is
[53:09] mystery babylon she is the great
[53:12] she is jezebel the false prophetess why
[53:15] because the true female is submissive to
[53:18] god
[53:19] christ is her head she has no word but
[53:21] his no thought but his no leadership but
[53:23] his but what about this church she has
[53:26] cast out the word destroyed the bibles
[53:28] and worthy essays of the godly she has
[53:30] slain those who would preach the truth
[53:32] she has taken over kings princes and
[53:34] nations controls armies and insists that
[53:37] she is the true body of christ and that
[53:39] her popes are the vicars of christ she
[53:41] is entirely seduced by the devil until
[53:43] she in turn has become the seducer of
[53:45] others
[53:46] she is the bride of satan
[53:49] and has produced his bastard child
[53:51] religions
[53:54] so
[53:54] satan has a bride and christ has a bride
[53:59] and these two are in contrast one to
[54:01] another
[54:03] and i don't ever want to be found
[54:05] emulating satan's bride but always
[54:07] emulating christ's bride
[54:10] let's go to revelation 17.
[54:17] revelation 17
[54:20] and verse 1.
[54:26] and there came one of the seven angels
[54:28] which had the seven vials and talked
[54:30] with me saying unto me come hither i
[54:32] will show unto thee the judgment of the
[54:34] great that sitteth upon many
[54:35] waters
[54:36] with whom the kings of the earth have
[54:38] committed fornication and the
[54:40] inhabitants of the earth have made drunk
[54:41] with the wine of her fornication
[54:43] so he carried me away in the spirit into
[54:45] the wilderness and i saw a woman sit
[54:47] upon a scarlet colored beast full of
[54:49] names of blasphemy having seven heads
[54:51] and ten horns
[54:53] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[54:54] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[54:56] precious stones and pearls having a
[54:59] golden cup in her hand full of the
[55:00] abominations and filthiness of her
[55:02] fornication
[55:03] and a pointer forehead was a name
[55:05] written mystery babylon the great the
[55:08] mother of harlots and abominations of
[55:10] the earth
[55:11] and i saw the woman drunken with the
[55:13] blood of the saints and with the blood
[55:14] of the martyrs of jesus when i saw her i
[55:17] wandered with great admiration
[55:20] amen we see that this is a beautiful
[55:23] woman like vashti
[55:25] beautiful but evil beautiful but
[55:27] self-willed beautiful but not having the
[55:30] character of christ and we know that she
[55:33] amen she is mystery babylon the great
[55:35] the mother of harlots and abominations
[55:37] of the earth so she is a and she's
[55:40] the mother of harlots because that
[55:42] system has brought harlot systems out
[55:46] amen let's go over to
[55:48] chapter 18 verse 4 and read just one
[55:49] more passage here
[55:51] and i heard another voice from heaven
[55:53] saying come out of her my people that
[55:54] you be not partakers of her sins that
[55:57] you receive not of her plagues for her
[55:59] sins have reached them to heaven and god
[56:01] hath remembered her iniquities remember
[56:03] her even as the rewarded you and double
[56:05] under her double according to her works
[56:08] and the cup which she hath filled to
[56:10] fill to her
[56:12] doubled
[56:13] how much she had glorified herself and
[56:15] lived deliciously so much torment and
[56:17] sorrow give her for she saith in her
[56:19] heart i sit a queen and am no widow and
[56:22] shall see no sorrow therefore shall her
[56:25] plagues come in one day death and
[56:26] mourning and famine and she shall be
[56:28] utterly burned with fire for strong is
[56:31] the lord who judgeth her
[56:33] so this woman calls herself a queen she
[56:36] believes she's the queen of heaven amen
[56:38] so we have a queen but there's going to
[56:40] be a queen of heaven there's going to be
[56:42] one that sits with him in his throne as
[56:44] he has overcome and sit with his father
[56:45] in his throne there will be a queen she
[56:48] claims to be the queen but her character
[56:50] and nature prove she's not the queen
[56:53] but there will be a queen so there's
[56:55] going to be an image of two queens one
[56:57] exalts herself one comes humbly
[57:00] submissively reverently and becomes
[57:03] exalted amen esther never exalted
[57:06] herself esther came low to the king the
[57:08] king exalted esther
[57:11] the king
[57:12] gave put esther in vashti's place but
[57:15] then after haman was brought down the
[57:18] king gave haman's house unto esther
[57:20] exalting her again
[57:23] the vashti exalted herself amen jezebel
[57:26] exalted herself amen this great
[57:29] has exalted herself lucifer exalted
[57:32] himself
[57:34] but christ comes meek and lowly
[57:37] so when christ comes amen he's a tender
[57:40] plant out of dry ground amen there's no
[57:42] commonness that we should desire he's
[57:44] smitten and afflicted and rejected he
[57:46] comes humble his voice won't even be
[57:48] heard in the city he won't even quench a
[57:50] smoking flax
[57:52] he comes quiet and humble and submissive
[57:55] to the will of god amen not weak there's
[57:58] no weakness in him but there's
[58:00] submissive humility in him
[58:03] right
[58:04] lucifer amen wants to be strong he
[58:07] exalts himself amen he's self-willed
[58:10] he's self-exalting amen he's all of
[58:12] these things that christ is not amen he
[58:15] exalts himself and he will be ultimately
[58:17] a base jezebel exalted herself she was a
[58:20] base the dogs licked her blood and ate
[58:22] her and she became dung upon the field
[58:26] but esther came humbly and she was
[58:28] exalted christ comes to earth through
[58:30] humble submission and he is exalted
[58:34] so
[58:34] we have to have the nature of christ not
[58:36] the nature of lucifer so these women in
[58:38] the bible are showing which queen they
[58:40] are and which bride they are
[58:44] amen and the churches in the world today
[58:46] are showing what queen they are and what
[58:48] bride there are
[58:52] brother bam says in christ the mystery
[58:54] of god revealed he said what's the
[58:55] denomination trying to do
[58:57] exalt itself like lucifer
[59:00] they so call themselves the church the
[59:02] bride which they are in revelation 17 as
[59:05] it spoke of the false bride above
[59:07] christ's little flock the bride lucifer
[59:09] thinks and exalts himself above the
[59:11] humble word of god's truth by the
[59:13] knowledge of the revelation and has
[59:15] placed himself by a seminary education
[59:17] and theology
[59:18] and that they have got themselves
[59:20] they've got themselves up
[59:22] so darwin is exalting themselves the
[59:24] other one's constantly coming in
[59:26] humility and submission to the word
[59:29] but lucifer looks strong and acted
[59:32] strong but he was weak
[59:34] christ came looking weak but he was
[59:36] strong
[59:39] amen he had strength that they could not
[59:42] detect he had power that was not noticed
[59:45] amen because his power was masked in
[59:48] humility and surrender amen and esther
[59:51] had the same thing she had a strength
[59:52] vastly didn't have
[59:55] christ as a strength lucifer doesn't
[59:58] have so humility and submission is not
[1:00:02] weakness
[1:00:04] and furthermore i think lack of humility
[1:00:07] and submission is weakness
[1:00:11] because when when we must begin to
[1:00:13] dominate a situation and control it amen
[1:00:17] it shows that that we have no trust or
[1:00:20] faith that things will work out on their
[1:00:22] own we're trying to manipulate or
[1:00:24] control an outcome and that shows an
[1:00:26] inner weakness amen but christ never had
[1:00:29] to manipulate or control anything he
[1:00:31] knew god was taking control of
[1:00:33] everything
[1:00:35] esther never needed to manipulate a
[1:00:37] situation all she had to do and it was
[1:00:39] getting to the king's presence and with
[1:00:41] the right atmosphere she just told the
[1:00:43] king what was wrong and the king took
[1:00:45] care of the rest amen but jezebel had no
[1:00:48] confidence anything would work out
[1:00:50] unless she made it work out
[1:00:52] lucifer took it in his own hands amen
[1:00:55] jezebel took it in her own hands amen
[1:00:57] the church has taken it in their own
[1:00:59] hands they've used politics they've used
[1:01:01] armies they used everything to control
[1:01:04] amen because they had no real trust they
[1:01:06] had no strength of virtue no real virtue
[1:01:09] it looked like they were strong but they
[1:01:11] were weak
[1:01:13] but the humble little bride and the
[1:01:15] humble christ were the ones with the
[1:01:17] real strength because they didn't have
[1:01:18] to protect themselves they had a
[1:01:20] protector they didn't have to defend
[1:01:22] themselves they had a defender they
[1:01:23] didn't have to dominate because they
[1:01:25] knew the one who created and controlled
[1:01:27] everything there was no need for
[1:01:29] domination manipulation control or
[1:01:31] politics
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:35] many of you
[1:01:36] who've worked in the workplace for quite
[1:01:38] a while you've seen people who
[1:01:40] manipulate and and then back by and use
[1:01:42] political schemes and try to get ahead
[1:01:44] amen and sometimes that may have even
[1:01:46] been targeted to you at times and they
[1:01:48] may have tried to get a promotion over
[1:01:50] you or work something out and but if
[1:01:52] you'll just hold steady
[1:01:56] and not react to any of that amen and
[1:01:59] just hold steady and prove that you
[1:02:01] trust god and you trust god placed you
[1:02:03] there and every promotion is given by
[1:02:05] god not by this company my position my
[1:02:08] place my income amen everything comes
[1:02:10] from god this guy amen it can do no more
[1:02:14] to me
[1:02:17] if i'm in god's place in god's will what
[1:02:19] he can do to me
[1:02:21] so you you know when when when one
[1:02:23] person starts manipulating and
[1:02:25] politicking and and doing spreading lies
[1:02:28] and and gathering sons of belial to
[1:02:31] bring false witness
[1:02:34] when you come over here and you try to
[1:02:36] find your own witnesses and and you
[1:02:38] tried to and then talk to people and and
[1:02:40] get things lined up and and get things
[1:02:42] squared away and get people on your side
[1:02:44] amen you're showing that you've got the
[1:02:46] same nature that that man over there has
[1:02:48] you may not be lying but you're showing
[1:02:50] a lack of strength and a lack of
[1:02:52] confidence in almighty god
[1:02:56] i say if god orders our steps we don't
[1:02:58] have to be afraid
[1:03:00] if god orders the the road we take and
[1:03:02] god knows the way that i take and the
[1:03:04] fosters of the righteous are ordered of
[1:03:06] the lord then i can say god i am in your
[1:03:09] hands amen and whatever you see fit is
[1:03:11] fine with me but i know you see my
[1:03:13] situation and i need your help
[1:03:17] and you watch oh i've seen it so many
[1:03:20] times myself i mean i've seen where i've
[1:03:22] reacted wrong in the wrong way and made
[1:03:24] a huge mess out of everything but i've
[1:03:26] also seen where i just held steady and
[1:03:28] trusted god and god will bring this
[1:03:30] house of hearts down amen
[1:03:33] it'll collapse it'll fall it'll go into
[1:03:35] ruin amen and all of a sudden you find
[1:03:38] yourself on top and you didn't mean to
[1:03:39] be on top
[1:03:41] you find yourself exalted amen man you
[1:03:43] didn't mean to you didn't ask for it you
[1:03:45] didn't want to be but it was god who
[1:03:47] done it because you
[1:03:48] you caught his nature and emulated his
[1:03:51] nature in the situation and god will
[1:03:53] take that and raise that up because
[1:03:54] that's what he once displayed
[1:03:57] is his nature
[1:04:00] amen this bible is not for sunday
[1:04:03] this bible's for every day
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:09] let's go to second chronicles 21.
[1:04:12] i want to look at another queen
[1:04:14] and unfortunately we have to look at
[1:04:16] another evil one
[1:04:23] let's go to
[1:04:28] i want to go to second kings 11.
[1:04:35] ii kings chapter 11.
[1:04:42] i want to look at this woman athaliah
[1:04:48] when afterlife chapter 11 verse 1
[1:04:51] when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw
[1:04:54] that her son was dead she arose and
[1:04:56] destroyed all the seed royal
[1:04:59] so the king is asai the king of judah
[1:05:02] his mother is is athaliah when athaliah
[1:05:06] saw that her son was dead
[1:05:09] she killed all the royal seeds
[1:05:12] her own grandchildren
[1:05:16] she killed all the royal seed
[1:05:20] but
[1:05:21] jehoshaba the daughter of of king jerome
[1:05:25] sister of azia took joash the son of
[1:05:28] ahaziah and stole him from among the
[1:05:30] king's sons which were slain and they
[1:05:32] hid him even him and his nurse in the
[1:05:34] bed chamber from athaliah so that he was
[1:05:36] not slain
[1:05:37] and he was with her in the house of the
[1:05:39] lord six years and athaliah did reign
[1:05:42] over the land
[1:05:44] and in the seventh year jehoiada sit and
[1:05:46] fetch the rulers over hundreds and the
[1:05:48] captains and the guards and brought them
[1:05:50] to him and to the house of the lord
[1:05:52] johad is the high priest
[1:05:55] brought them to the house of the lord
[1:05:56] and made a covenant with them and took
[1:05:58] an oath of them in the house of the lord
[1:05:59] and showed them the king's son so
[1:06:02] there's a story going on here where
[1:06:04] athaliah amen is mother to uh uh ahaziah
[1:06:08] and ahaziah is killed and then she kills
[1:06:10] all the royal seeds so there can be no
[1:06:12] successor and she absurds the throne and
[1:06:15] she takes control and she becomes queen
[1:06:18] as soul uh the soul queen no king over
[1:06:22] all of israel for six years amen
[1:06:25] so this this woman this false church is
[1:06:27] dominating for six church ages
[1:06:30] but in the seventh year amen the priest
[1:06:33] is going to show everybody no there's
[1:06:36] still a seed amen there's still a
[1:06:38] remnant that's come through there's
[1:06:39] still one here and when joash was seven
[1:06:41] years old amen in the house of the lord
[1:06:44] he presented joash as the king's son and
[1:06:47] joash was now one that could take the
[1:06:48] throne and this brings the demise of
[1:06:51] athaliah amen she's killed and and she's
[1:06:54] she's cast out and she's she's killed
[1:06:56] and joash becomes king
[1:06:59] so you see here another woman another
[1:07:01] evil queen and she does the same thing
[1:07:04] these evil queens do she takes it upon
[1:07:06] herself to give herself a position she
[1:07:08] exalts herself she was already the
[1:07:10] mother of the queen she would have been
[1:07:12] the grandmother of the next king
[1:07:15] she had a position but that position
[1:07:17] wasn't enough because lucifer had a
[1:07:19] great position but that position wasn't
[1:07:21] enough
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:07:23] you see amen whenever your position is
[1:07:26] not enough amen that's a problem
[1:07:29] so his problem
[1:07:31] his position wasn't enough she had to
[1:07:33] get just a little more power a little
[1:07:36] more authority being the mother of the
[1:07:38] king was all right but now that she lost
[1:07:40] that being the grandmother of the king
[1:07:42] that was not good enough so she kills
[1:07:43] her own grandchildren amen she kills all
[1:07:45] the royal seed so that she alone has all
[1:07:48] the power and all the authority
[1:07:51] this is the very tactics of lucifer
[1:07:54] and now she reigns amen and she's in
[1:07:57] control she's dominating she has a
[1:07:59] dominating female spirit she's running
[1:08:01] everything amen but there was a remnant
[1:08:03] that survived a seed that was coming
[1:08:05] down through and when he got to the
[1:08:07] seventh church age now it was time to
[1:08:09] show there is a son amen there is a king
[1:08:12] now there's a king in place amen he's
[1:08:14] been all along but now he's going to
[1:08:16] come to power
[1:08:19] and when he comes in the seventh year
[1:08:21] and then it brings her destruction and
[1:08:22] her demise
[1:08:25] beautiful
[1:08:27] now the question is where did athaliah
[1:08:29] come from
[1:08:32] let's go back
[1:08:34] to second chronicles
[1:08:37] i guess the second chronicles
[1:08:40] we're going to bounce between second
[1:08:41] chronicles and second kings
[1:08:44] second chronicles 21
[1:08:48] second chronicles 21
[1:08:51] and verse 1.
[1:08:58] now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers
[1:09:01] and was buried with his fathers in the
[1:09:03] city of david in jehovah his son reigned
[1:09:06] in a stead
[1:09:07] and he had brethren the sons of
[1:09:09] jehoshaphat azariah jahil and zachariah
[1:09:12] and azariah and mikhail and
[1:09:15] sephitia all of these were the sons of
[1:09:17] jehoshaphat king of israel and their
[1:09:19] father gave them great gifts of silver
[1:09:21] and gold and of precious things with
[1:09:23] fenced cities in judah but the kingdom
[1:09:26] gave heed to jeham
[1:09:28] jehoram because he was the firstborn now
[1:09:31] when jehoram was risen up to to the
[1:09:33] kingdom of his father he strengthened
[1:09:35] himself and slew all his brethren with
[1:09:37] the sword and diverse also of the
[1:09:39] princes of israel
[1:09:41] jerome was thirty and two years old when
[1:09:43] he began to reign and he reigned eight
[1:09:45] years in jerusalem and he walked in the
[1:09:47] way of the kings of israel like as did
[1:09:49] the house of ahab for he had the
[1:09:52] daughter of ahab to wife
[1:09:56] ahab's daughter became his wife
[1:10:00] who's ahab's daughter
[1:10:03] athaliah
[1:10:05] the same woman who killed all her own
[1:10:07] grandchildren and become king of judah
[1:10:09] she was the daughter of ahab and
[1:10:12] jezebel
[1:10:15] this mistake
[1:10:16] that was made all the way back when
[1:10:18] asher didn't drive out the inhabitants
[1:10:21] of zidane is still wreaking havoc and
[1:10:24] now you have jezebel as a type of the
[1:10:26] great false church but jezebel's going
[1:10:28] to have a daughter and that daughter is
[1:10:30] going to move down from that first false
[1:10:32] system of israel and move down into
[1:10:34] judah and to the house of david and
[1:10:36] she's going to slip in through marriage
[1:10:37] to the house of david and bring the same
[1:10:39] corruption her mother brought to the 10
[1:10:42] tribes she's bringing now to the house
[1:10:43] of david
[1:10:45] god has wrote the church ages all the
[1:10:47] way back in second kings
[1:10:50] in second chronicles because that's
[1:10:51] exactly what happened jezebel had
[1:10:54] daughters and those daughters amen
[1:10:56] brought that false system and mingled it
[1:10:58] right down in with the true seed and
[1:11:00] brought it into protestantism and
[1:11:02] corrupted the whole thing
[1:11:04] because you had the ten tribes that
[1:11:06] separated from the house of david which
[1:11:08] was judah and benjamin amen and there
[1:11:10] were still righteous kings in the house
[1:11:12] of david and they still had jerusalem
[1:11:14] they still had true worship but that
[1:11:15] false system started to creep in and
[1:11:17] there's 10 nations because they made
[1:11:19] those golden calves to keep the people
[1:11:21] separated and in that system is when
[1:11:24] ahab goes and grabs jezebel out of the
[1:11:27] king of the zidonians and brings her
[1:11:29] down and she brings baal worship amen
[1:11:31] all the way down because they were
[1:11:33] already open into idolatry
[1:11:36] and begins to mingle this in but they
[1:11:38] have a daughter and that daughter amen
[1:11:41] becomes the wife amen of one of the
[1:11:44] king's sons in israel and that that
[1:11:47] daughter is athalil and she takes the
[1:11:50] same nature of her mother who took the
[1:11:52] same nature of kanan who took the same
[1:11:54] nature of lucifer and now when she saw
[1:11:56] an opportunity for power she wasn't
[1:11:58] content in the position she had she slew
[1:12:01] them all so that she could exalt herself
[1:12:06] this is always matching the false line
[1:12:10] so he had dog the daughter of ahab the
[1:12:12] wife
[1:12:14] and he wrought that which was evil in
[1:12:15] the sight of god now let's keep your
[1:12:18] place here in second chronicles and
[1:12:19] let's turn back to second kings
[1:12:24] verse eight
[1:12:31] second kings eight and sixteen
[1:12:39] and then the fifth year of jerome the
[1:12:41] son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat
[1:12:43] being then king of judah jehoram the son
[1:12:46] of josh jehoshaphat king of judah began
[1:12:48] to reign thirty and two years old was he
[1:12:51] when he began to reign and he reigned
[1:12:53] eight years in jerusalem and he walked
[1:12:56] in the way of the kings of israel as did
[1:12:58] the house of ahab for the daughter of
[1:13:00] ahab was his wife and he did evil in the
[1:13:02] sight of the lord
[1:13:04] there it is again go back to second
[1:13:05] chronicles 22
[1:13:10] verse 1.
[1:13:13] and the inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:13:16] made a heziah
[1:13:18] his youngest son
[1:13:20] this is jehoram's who we were just
[1:13:22] talking about this is his son
[1:13:25] may jerome may i'm sorry and the
[1:13:27] inhabitants of jerusalem made a zio his
[1:13:29] youngest son king in his stead
[1:13:31] for the band of men that came with the
[1:13:33] arabians to the camp had slain all of
[1:13:35] the eldest so aaziah the son of jehoram
[1:13:38] king of judah reigned
[1:13:40] forty and two years old was zeziah when
[1:13:42] he began to reign and he reigned one
[1:13:44] year in jerusalem his mother's name also
[1:13:47] was athaliah the daughter of omri
[1:13:51] and he walked in the ways of the house
[1:13:53] of ahab for his mother was his counselor
[1:13:55] to do wickedly
[1:13:57] wherefore he did evil in the sight of
[1:13:59] the lord like the house of ahab for they
[1:14:01] were in his they were his counselors
[1:14:03] after the death of his father
[1:14:05] to his destruction
[1:14:08] i want to
[1:14:09] tie this together because it gets a
[1:14:10] little complicated when you go through
[1:14:12] the geologies and go back and forth and
[1:14:14] there's a reason it's complicated
[1:14:17] when
[1:14:18] when
[1:14:19] ahab was on the scene
[1:14:22] he had a friend
[1:14:25] my pen is not working oh there it is
[1:14:27] he had a friend
[1:14:29] and that friend
[1:14:31] was jehoshaphat
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:35] jehoshaphat was king of judah
[1:14:38] and jehoshaphat was a righteous man
[1:14:41] they still had the true worship they
[1:14:42] still had uh uh jerusalem amen
[1:14:46] they still had the altar they still had
[1:14:48] everything
[1:14:49] ahab and jehoshaphat jehoshaphat made
[1:14:53] peace with ahab and became a friend to
[1:14:54] ahab
[1:14:56] and this sounds like a good thing
[1:14:58] because they're all israel and the ten
[1:14:59] tribes separated and jehoshaphat and
[1:15:01] let's just all come together and be
[1:15:03] brothers this is the start of the
[1:15:04] ecumenical movement
[1:15:07] and this is why the ecumenical movement
[1:15:08] is so dangerous amen because jehoshaphat
[1:15:12] remained righteous all of his life but
[1:15:14] jehoshaphat kept getting into trouble
[1:15:16] because he was a friend of ahab amen and
[1:15:18] they remember when they went up they
[1:15:19] were going to go against the syrians and
[1:15:20] they said have any prophets here and he
[1:15:22] said i got 400 and they brought the
[1:15:24] prophets up and they said go on up but
[1:15:26] he says have you got one more that's
[1:15:27] when mekiah comes on the scene because
[1:15:29] jehoshaphat knew something wasn't right
[1:15:31] with that and he asked for another
[1:15:32] prophet
[1:15:33] and that prophet come and prophesied the
[1:15:35] truth but ahab didn't like it and had
[1:15:37] him locked up amen and that was ahab's
[1:15:40] death so jehoshaphat's always getting in
[1:15:42] trouble with this ahab remember when
[1:15:44] they went down to fight against
[1:15:47] i think it was edom i don't remember now
[1:15:48] no they went to fight somebody the king
[1:15:50] of edom was with them but they went to
[1:15:52] go implore of elisha what they should do
[1:15:54] and elisha said i wouldn't even speak to
[1:15:56] you to a if it wasn't for the presence
[1:15:58] of jehoshaphat
[1:16:00] so this was not an alliance that god was
[1:16:02] pleased with
[1:16:04] it looked good like ecumenicism looks
[1:16:07] good it's good mentally but it's not
[1:16:08] good because ahab was already steeped in
[1:16:11] adultery and false worship and already
[1:16:12] aligned himself with jezebel
[1:16:16] so
[1:16:18] look at this ahab and jezebel have a son
[1:16:21] that son's name is jehoram
[1:16:25] guess what jehoshaphat and his wife have
[1:16:27] a son
[1:16:28] oh no
[1:16:30] i don't know how to get rid of that
[1:16:33] jehoram
[1:16:35] okay oh yeah i do know how to get rid of
[1:16:37] that go down here
[1:16:39] nope it doesn't work
[1:16:42] anyways
[1:16:44] so you can see
[1:16:45] this friendship and this ecumenicism is
[1:16:48] already bringing in influence
[1:16:50] one has a son named jehoram
[1:16:53] the other has a son named jehovah
[1:16:56] remember jehoshaphat kept going up to
[1:16:58] visit ahab
[1:17:01] is that right
[1:17:02] so they were visiting they become
[1:17:04] friends they become to make peace amen
[1:17:07] and now ahab and jezebel have a jehovah
[1:17:10] jehoshaphat has a jehovah room
[1:17:12] and when it comes time for jehoram to
[1:17:14] get married where does he get a wife
[1:17:17] from here
[1:17:19] and he gets athaliah
[1:17:22] to be his wife
[1:17:24] and now that corrupt thing from canaan
[1:17:26] comes right into judah
[1:17:28] through the children through the next
[1:17:30] generation
[1:17:32] ahab and jezebel have another son
[1:17:36] and his name
[1:17:37] is ahaziah
[1:17:40] so when athaliah and jehovah have a son
[1:17:44] they name him
[1:17:45] ahaziah
[1:17:49] huh
[1:17:50] you think you can join friendship with
[1:17:53] false system and not have it influence
[1:17:56] you
[1:17:58] we can jehoshaphat can stay righteous
[1:18:00] amen he did stay righteous but what
[1:18:02] happened to his son what happened to his
[1:18:04] son's sons amen and instead of ahaz when
[1:18:08] jehoram amen when he died ahaziah did
[1:18:12] evil amen like the house of ahab because
[1:18:15] he had his mother to his counselor
[1:18:18] so as i became his counselor so now
[1:18:21] she's influencing the sun the sun has
[1:18:23] become evil amen now when the son dies
[1:18:27] she wipes out the whole line and now she
[1:18:30] takes authority over the entire system
[1:18:33] what is she doing she's following in the
[1:18:35] footsteps of lucifer the anointing
[1:18:37] that's upon her
[1:18:40] you see now when you go down through the
[1:18:42] bible from this point on amen there's so
[1:18:44] many times these families have the same
[1:18:46] names that's why it's sometimes so hard
[1:18:48] to read amen second king are kings and
[1:18:50] chronicles amen because the king of
[1:18:52] judah and the king of israel will have
[1:18:54] the same name amen jehoram jehoram
[1:18:58] ahaziah ahaziah who are we talking about
[1:19:01] and then sometimes they change the name
[1:19:03] to make it simpler so sometimes it's
[1:19:04] joram sometimes
[1:19:06] i don't remember even what it is jehoram
[1:19:08] sometimes is joe room
[1:19:11] and so you know you find out that we
[1:19:14] jehoshaphat thought he could just join
[1:19:16] that ecumenical thing and just become a
[1:19:18] friend and maybe win a brother amen but
[1:19:20] what happened is that corruption moved
[1:19:22] right down into his house and the next
[1:19:24] generation and then the next generation
[1:19:26] was corrupt
[1:19:30] that's
[1:19:31] the wicked side
[1:19:34] but i want to turn and look at another
[1:19:36] one in ruth chapter 3.
[1:19:40] now i want to contrast this
[1:20:02] ruth chapter 3
[1:20:04] verse 1.
[1:20:07] we know ruth now had married an
[1:20:10] israelite man
[1:20:13] in moab she's a moabitess
[1:20:16] her her story's one of disaster there's
[1:20:20] famine her husband dies her
[1:20:22] brother-in-law dies her father-in-law
[1:20:24] dies
[1:20:24] her and her mother-in-law and her
[1:20:26] sister-in-law are left alone and
[1:20:28] they come back into the land and her
[1:20:29] sister-in-law goes turns back and but
[1:20:31] she stays faithful to naomi and they
[1:20:33] come into the land and they're trying to
[1:20:35] make a living trying to to to
[1:20:38] gather some barley
[1:20:40] and some wheat to survive and and
[1:20:43] naomi's going to come up with a plan
[1:20:45] here in chapter 3 so let's read it
[1:20:47] chapter 3 verse 1. then naomi her
[1:20:49] mother-in-law said unto her my daughter
[1:20:52] shall i not seek rest for thee that it
[1:20:54] may be well with thee
[1:20:56] and now is not boaz of our kindred with
[1:20:58] those maidens thou wast
[1:21:00] behold the when behold he went with
[1:21:02] barley tonight in the threshing floor
[1:21:05] wash thyself therefore and anoint thee
[1:21:07] and put thy raiment upon thee and get
[1:21:09] thee down to the floor but make not
[1:21:11] thyself known unto the man until he
[1:21:12] shall have done eating and drinking
[1:21:15] and it shall be when he lieth
[1:21:17] down that he shall mark you shall mark
[1:21:19] the place where he shall lie and thou
[1:21:21] shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay
[1:21:23] thee down and he will tell thee what
[1:21:25] thou shalt do
[1:21:27] and she said unto her all that thou
[1:21:28] sayeth unto me i will do
[1:21:31] i want you to catch this character of
[1:21:33] ruth it's already showed up before in
[1:21:35] the book of ruth when she decided to
[1:21:36] stay with naomi and said i'll go where
[1:21:38] you go your people will be my people
[1:21:40] your god will be my god will you die
[1:21:42] live i'll live where you die i'll die
[1:21:45] but here naomi her mother-in-law begins
[1:21:47] to give her instructions and she doesn't
[1:21:50] argue she doesn't say no i don't want to
[1:21:51] wear that or i don't want to go tonight
[1:21:53] i want to no she says all that you said
[1:21:55] i will do
[1:21:57] there's a reason god writes his bible
[1:21:59] this way amen because he's trying to
[1:22:01] show us the character of the true queen
[1:22:03] amen the true bride
[1:22:05] verse six and she went down into the
[1:22:07] floor and did according to all that her
[1:22:09] mother-in-law bait her and when boaz had
[1:22:11] eaten and drunk and his heart was merry
[1:22:14] he went to lie down at the end of the
[1:22:15] heap of corn and she came softly and
[1:22:18] uncovered his feet and laid her down
[1:22:20] and it came to pass at midnight that the
[1:22:22] man was afraid and turned himself and
[1:22:23] behold a woman lay at his feet and he
[1:22:26] said who art thou and she answered i am
[1:22:28] ruth thine handmaid
[1:22:30] look at how she even addresses herself
[1:22:33] i'm thy handmaid
[1:22:35] not high but low she always comes low
[1:22:39] i'm thy handmaid spread therefore thy
[1:22:40] skirt over thine handmaid for thou art
[1:22:43] near kinsmen
[1:22:45] he said blessed be thou of the lord my
[1:22:47] daughter for thou has shown more
[1:22:49] kindness in the latter and then at the
[1:22:51] beginning insomuch as thou followest not
[1:22:54] young men whether poor or rich
[1:22:57] and now my daughter fear not i will do
[1:22:59] to thee all that thou requires for all
[1:23:01] the city of my people doth know that
[1:23:04] thou art a virtuous
[1:23:06] woman
[1:23:07] you know what virtuous means
[1:23:09] strength
[1:23:11] here comes ruth into the land and
[1:23:14] weakness and humility and destitute and
[1:23:18] afflicted
[1:23:20] she doesn't come in royal pageantry she
[1:23:23] doesn't come with strength she doesn't
[1:23:25] come with with goods and
[1:23:28] and servants she comes with nothing she
[1:23:30] comes destitute amen and then for a
[1:23:32] living she starts amen gathering amen
[1:23:35] just what little bit she can behind the
[1:23:36] reapers and it's just enough for her to
[1:23:38] name me to survive they have nothing
[1:23:41] amen but but when she comes at the at
[1:23:44] the commandment of naomi she is giving
[1:23:46] herself amen to an older man because he
[1:23:49] says thou has shown more kindness in thy
[1:23:51] ladder and then at that first because
[1:23:52] thou seekest not after young men whether
[1:23:55] rich or poor you're not here for lust
[1:23:57] you're not here for your own gain you're
[1:24:00] here for redemption for naomi
[1:24:03] amen and he says
[1:24:04] all the city does know that you're a
[1:24:07] strong woman
[1:24:09] see strength is not always what it looks
[1:24:11] like strength is inward and strength is
[1:24:14] character
[1:24:16] she had the character and they knew she
[1:24:18] had the character he knew she had the
[1:24:20] character and he was going to redeem her
[1:24:23] said oh
[1:24:24] all the city of my people does know that
[1:24:26] thou art a virtuous woman and now it is
[1:24:29] true that i am thy near kinsmen albeit
[1:24:31] there is a kinsman nearer than i so he
[1:24:33] goes to do the work of the kinsmen
[1:24:35] redeemer and we know that she's redeemed
[1:24:38] and redemption comes in naomi and we
[1:24:40] know the whole story but i wanted to
[1:24:42] take this snapshot to show what was the
[1:24:44] character of ruth amen what was the
[1:24:46] being displayed in her approach how did
[1:24:48] she approach into boaz did she march up
[1:24:51] to him in the middle of the day did she
[1:24:52] come up and say i need this and i need
[1:24:55] that and don't you see and and why won't
[1:24:57] you do something for us but she comes
[1:24:59] with humility as a handmaid
[1:25:02] now she's surrendering self to the
[1:25:04] headship of an older man she's not doing
[1:25:06] it for any personal amen gain what we
[1:25:09] say is personal gain she's doing
[1:25:11] something for redemption purposes
[1:25:14] and because naomi told her to and she
[1:25:16] says
[1:25:16] throw thy skirt over me cover me for
[1:25:18] thou art in their kinsmen and the man is
[1:25:21] moved by her humility her surrender her
[1:25:24] sacrifice
[1:25:26] and because of that she becomes one of
[1:25:29] the queens of the bible
[1:25:31] not because she was like vashti or
[1:25:33] jezebel or athaliah
[1:25:36] but because she was like sarah
[1:25:39] and rebecca
[1:25:41] like esther
[1:25:42] and like ruth
[1:25:45] who do you want to be like
[1:25:48] i'll take the way with the lord's
[1:25:50] despise for you
[1:25:53] i want to look at one more lady here in
[1:25:55] first kings chapter 1.
[1:26:02] i want to look at bathsheba
[1:26:04] but not at the time of the fall i'm
[1:26:06] going to look at later in life
[1:26:12] in this part of the
[1:26:14] scriptures david is quite elderly he's
[1:26:17] about to pass off the scene and adani
[1:26:19] has come up with a plan to try to usurp
[1:26:22] himself or exalt himself to the throne
[1:26:25] in first kings chapter 1 verse 11 it
[1:26:27] says wherefore
[1:26:29] nathan spake unto bathsheba so nathan
[1:26:31] the prophet comes to bathsheba the
[1:26:33] mother of solomon saying hast thou not
[1:26:36] heard that adonaija the son of haggath
[1:26:38] doth rain and david our lord knoweth it
[1:26:40] not
[1:26:41] now therefore come let me i pray thee
[1:26:44] give thee counsel that thou mayest save
[1:26:46] thine own life and the life of thy son
[1:26:48] solomon
[1:26:50] go and get thee into king david and say
[1:26:52] unto him didst not thou my lord o king
[1:26:55] swear unto thine handmaids saying
[1:26:57] assuredly solomon thy son shall reign
[1:26:59] after me and he shall sit upon the
[1:27:01] throne why then doth adonai reign
[1:27:05] behold while thou yet talk us there with
[1:27:07] the king i also will come in after thee
[1:27:09] and confirm thy words and bathsheba went
[1:27:12] in unto the king and to the chamber and
[1:27:14] the king was very old and abyshak the
[1:27:16] shunammite ministered unto the king
[1:27:19] and bathsheba bowed and did obscenes
[1:27:22] unto the king and the king said what
[1:27:24] wouldest thou and she said unto him
[1:27:26] my lord thou swearest by the lord thy
[1:27:29] god unto thine handmaids saying
[1:27:31] assuredly solomon thy son shall reign
[1:27:33] after me and he shall sit upon my throne
[1:27:37] and now behold adonijah reigneth and now
[1:27:40] my lord the king thou knowest did not
[1:27:44] and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle
[1:27:47] and sheep and abundance and hath called
[1:27:49] all the sons of the king and abethar the
[1:27:51] priest and job the captain of the host
[1:27:53] but solomon thy servant hath he not
[1:27:55] called
[1:27:56] and thou my lord o king the eyes of all
[1:27:58] israel are upon thee that thou shouldst
[1:28:01] tell them who shall sit on the throne of
[1:28:03] my lord the king after him
[1:28:05] otherwise it shall come to pass when my
[1:28:08] lord the king shall sleep with his
[1:28:09] fathers that i and my son solomon shall
[1:28:11] be counted offenders
[1:28:13] and lo while she yet talked with him the
[1:28:15] king nathan the prophet also came in
[1:28:18] and they told the king saying behold
[1:28:19] nathan the prophet and when he was come
[1:28:21] in before the king he bowed himself
[1:28:23] before the king with his face to the
[1:28:25] ground and nathan said my lord o king
[1:28:27] hast thou said adonai shall reign after
[1:28:30] me and he shall sit upon my throne
[1:28:32] and he has gone down this day and has
[1:28:34] slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep and
[1:28:37] abundance and hath called all the king's
[1:28:39] sons and the captains of the host and
[1:28:40] they be ether the priest and behold they
[1:28:43] eat and drink before him and say god
[1:28:45] save king adenija
[1:28:48] but me even me thy servant and zodac the
[1:28:51] priest in bania the son of jehoiada and
[1:28:53] thy servant solomon hath he not called
[1:28:56] is this thing done by my lord the king
[1:28:58] and thou hast not showed it unto thy
[1:29:00] servants who should sit on the throne of
[1:29:02] my lord the king after him
[1:29:04] then king david answered and said call
[1:29:06] me bathsheba and she came unto the
[1:29:08] king's presence and stood before the
[1:29:10] king
[1:29:11] and the king swear and said as the lord
[1:29:13] liveth that hath redeemed my soul of all
[1:29:15] distress
[1:29:16] even as i swear unto thee by the lord
[1:29:18] god of israel saying assurely solomon
[1:29:21] thy son shall reign after me and he
[1:29:23] shall sit upon my throne in my stead
[1:29:25] even so will i certainly do this day
[1:29:28] then bathsheba bowed with her face to
[1:29:30] the earth and did reverence the king and
[1:29:32] said let my lord king david live forever
[1:29:36] bathsheba now has a situation that
[1:29:40] that's troubling because adonis is
[1:29:42] taking the throne but
[1:29:44] but the lord david had already told her
[1:29:47] i'm going to have solomon reign in my
[1:29:49] stead so she already has the word of
[1:29:51] david amen and now nathan the prophet
[1:29:54] comes into her and says here's what you
[1:29:56] want to do the king doesn't know it go
[1:29:57] in and remind him amen of what he told
[1:30:00] you and she goes in and says lord did
[1:30:02] you not say
[1:30:04] then nathan comes and confirms what she
[1:30:06] says and the king calls her back and
[1:30:07] says i will do what i said do
[1:30:10] listen bathsheba didn't need an army
[1:30:15] bathsheba didn't need soldiers bathsheba
[1:30:18] didn't need political allies all that
[1:30:20] bathsheba needed to do was get in the
[1:30:22] presence of the king and said king did
[1:30:25] not you say
[1:30:26] i still believe you and i believe what
[1:30:29] you said to be true
[1:30:32] amen sometimes we need to come into
[1:30:34] god's presence and not complain and not
[1:30:36] beg and not people say god did you not
[1:30:39] say i believe what you said to be true
[1:30:42] did you not say that by your stripes i'm
[1:30:44] healed i believe that to be true lord
[1:30:48] i remember i was talking to brother
[1:30:49] bernie sand martin about his testimony
[1:30:51] of god delivering him from from the
[1:30:53] neuropathy that it was left over from
[1:30:55] shingles and he says i didn't keep
[1:30:58] asking god to heal me but i kept telling
[1:31:01] god that i still believe
[1:31:03] oh praise god not demanding not telling
[1:31:06] god do this and do that and do that but
[1:31:08] coming in humility in reverence and say
[1:31:10] lord i still believe amen i'm having
[1:31:13] these symptoms but i still believe amen
[1:31:16] not saying god you've got to god you do
[1:31:18] and right now not anything like that but
[1:31:20] coming to the lord and saying lord i
[1:31:22] still believe your word
[1:31:25] i still believe and bathsheba come and
[1:31:27] said lord david did you not say
[1:31:31] am i mistaken or did you not say and the
[1:31:34] king upheld his word
[1:31:37] she didn't have to go call the egyptians
[1:31:39] she didn't have to go get another army
[1:31:41] she didn't have to do what adonijah did
[1:31:44] adonijah didn't go to the king adenija
[1:31:47] took it upon himself
[1:31:49] adenizer exalted himself and he made
[1:31:52] political allies and he got people
[1:31:54] together and he gave a bunch of gifts
[1:31:55] out to get the support of the people but
[1:31:57] bathsheba didn't need to do that all she
[1:31:59] needed to do was get in the presence of
[1:32:01] the king and say king i believe what you
[1:32:03] said and i remember what you said
[1:32:06] i'm just telling you i still believe
[1:32:10] i said i want to say god under every
[1:32:13] circumstance
[1:32:14] i still believe what you said
[1:32:17] i'm not going to panic i'm not going to
[1:32:19] go make my own way i'm not going to
[1:32:21] manipulate i'm not going to control but
[1:32:23] i'm going to come back into your
[1:32:25] presence and bow myself in ob essence
[1:32:27] before you and say lord your word said
[1:32:30] and i still believe your word
[1:32:33] you said you would and i still believe
[1:32:35] you will
[1:32:37] ruth didn't have to manipulate the
[1:32:39] situation all she had to do was do what
[1:32:41] naomi said
[1:32:42] bathsheba just did what the prophet of
[1:32:44] god said and reminded the lord she
[1:32:46] believed and i believe that's the same
[1:32:49] pattern the bride can take we can come
[1:32:51] in humility and reverence not demanding
[1:32:53] not controlling not manipulating not
[1:32:56] saying lord i trust you and then going
[1:32:58] to talk to everybody under the sun about
[1:33:00] our problems
[1:33:02] lord i trust you to take care of this
[1:33:04] but can you help me can you help me can
[1:33:06] you help me can you help me
[1:33:08] i'm not trying to get somebody to go
[1:33:10] talk to somebody who can talk to
[1:33:11] somebody who can
[1:33:14] but just say lord
[1:33:15] i trust you
[1:33:18] i believe you
[1:33:20] i want to show true virtue on the inside
[1:33:24] that there's a strength of character
[1:33:26] that says i don't need to control the
[1:33:28] situation all i need to go is stand
[1:33:31] before the one who controls the
[1:33:32] situation
[1:33:34] and say i still believe you
[1:33:36] would you cover your skirt over me lord
[1:33:39] would you take care of me
[1:33:41] i'm your handmaid
[1:33:42] i'm your servant
[1:33:44] i'm nothing but what you make me
[1:33:46] but i'm here showing you reverence
[1:33:49] and respect
[1:33:50] and honor
[1:33:51] and saying i still believe your word
[1:33:54] oh i believe that attitude would move
[1:33:57] the heart of god
[1:33:59] not like jezebel not like athaliah
[1:34:02] those things are all failures
[1:34:05] but like the humility of character of
[1:34:07] the ones who can't do anything
[1:34:11] jezebel had strength she was a princess
[1:34:14] before
[1:34:15] she knew how to manipulate how to do
[1:34:17] athleia had strength because she comes
[1:34:19] from a king's house she could manipulate
[1:34:21] she could do
[1:34:22] but sarah what could sarah do
[1:34:25] what strength did she have
[1:34:27] what could ruth do what could she do
[1:34:29] what could any of these women do they
[1:34:30] didn't have what the other women had and
[1:34:33] what can the humble little bride of
[1:34:34] christ really do compared with the great
[1:34:36] big conglomeration of the churches
[1:34:40] but she's got virtue that they can never
[1:34:43] have
[1:34:44] she's got the very nature and character
[1:34:46] of christ she has what was different
[1:34:49] between michael and the devil and then
[1:34:51] the bible says in jude when they were
[1:34:53] disputing over the body of moses michael
[1:34:56] did not even bring a railing accusation
[1:34:58] against the devil he just said the lord
[1:35:00] deal with thee
[1:35:02] tell me who had more character who had
[1:35:04] more strength
[1:35:06] christ didn't have to defend himself he
[1:35:08] didn't have to manipulate the situation
[1:35:10] he didn't have to go get people on his
[1:35:12] side because there was people against
[1:35:14] him
[1:35:16] all he had to do was stand still
[1:35:19] and let god work it out
[1:35:26] amen
[1:35:28] praise god
[1:35:30] i want to read one more quote here
[1:35:33] musicians if you could come
[1:35:38] brother remember said again the kind of
[1:35:40] woman that a man would choose
[1:35:42] would reflect his ambition and his
[1:35:44] character
[1:35:46] what kind of woman do they have jews
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:49] what kind of woman did boaz choose
[1:35:52] i think christ is choosing the right
[1:35:55] kind of woman
[1:35:56] let's all stand
[1:36:06] esther
[1:36:08] when she entered into that
[1:36:11] when she entered into that palace
[1:36:14] esther had nothing going for her
[1:36:17] she didn't have a reputation she didn't
[1:36:19] have wealth she didn't she didn't come
[1:36:22] from the most likely source to be the
[1:36:24] next queen esther had nothing going for
[1:36:26] her but the predetermined will of god
[1:36:31] she didn't have connections she didn't
[1:36:33] she didn't have she had nothing going
[1:36:35] for her who knows what other women were
[1:36:37] gathered and what things they had going
[1:36:39] for but we know vashti was a great woman
[1:36:41] but esther entered into that situation
[1:36:43] with nothing and she may have come in
[1:36:46] the lowest but it wasn't long till the
[1:36:48] lowest was taken to the highest amen
[1:36:51] and and joseph when joseph entered into
[1:36:54] egypt he entered in the lowest amen but
[1:36:57] he entered in in humility as a slave and
[1:37:00] was sold into slavery amen and then from
[1:37:03] there he got a little bit of an
[1:37:04] exaltation that was cast into the prison
[1:37:06] now and he went as low as he could go in
[1:37:08] egypt down into the dungeon but from the
[1:37:11] dungeon when it was god's time and he
[1:37:13] remained faithful and had the right
[1:37:14] virtue and right character when it was
[1:37:16] time god brought him from the lowest to
[1:37:18] the highest and esther was brought from
[1:37:21] the lowest to the highest amen and ruth
[1:37:23] was brought from her low condition to a
[1:37:25] high condition amen and the bride of
[1:37:27] jesus christ is being brought through
[1:37:29] humility and subjection and reverence
[1:37:31] and she is going to be exalted and she
[1:37:33] will sit with him in his throne even as
[1:37:35] he is overcome and sit in his father's
[1:37:37] tongue
[1:37:39] and how is she going to do it through
[1:37:41] virtue
[1:37:42] the character of christ reflected in her
[1:37:46] i say god help us
[1:37:49] to reflect your character
[1:37:51] to have true
[1:37:53] virtue
[1:37:54] not false strength of alliances and
[1:37:58] human endeavors and reasoning and wisdom
[1:38:01] but true virtue that can stand still and
[1:38:04] say god knows
[1:38:06] and i'm in god's hands
[1:38:08] and when i am tried like gold when i am
[1:38:10] tried with fire i shall come forth like
[1:38:12] gold
[1:38:14] god is able
[1:38:16] now when we get in all these situations
[1:38:18] we get into our lives and we start when
[1:38:20] we start to react to the situation
[1:38:22] around us let's go back and say who am i
[1:38:25] reflecting
[1:38:27] in my reaction and say god help me
[1:38:30] i trust in you
[1:38:33] god i'm not telling you what to do i'm
[1:38:35] only telling you that i need you
[1:38:37] i'm not telling you what you need to do
[1:38:40] i'm only telling you that i need you and
[1:38:41] i'm telling you i'm telling you that i
[1:38:43] love you i reverence you i bow before
[1:38:46] you and i still believe what you said in
[1:38:48] your word
[1:38:50] that's a much better approach
[1:38:52] when brother bernie told me that
[1:38:53] something inside of me clicked and said
[1:38:55] that's it
[1:38:56] that's the right approach god i'm not
[1:38:58] telling you what to do i'm not telling
[1:39:00] you when to do it i'm not telling you
[1:39:01] how to do it you already have that
[1:39:02] figured out
[1:39:04] all i'm telling you is i love you with
[1:39:06] all my heart and i trust you with all my
[1:39:08] being and whatever you say is right but
[1:39:10] i want you to know i'm still believing
[1:39:12] your word
[1:39:13] did you not say that by your stripes you
[1:39:16] healed all my diseases
[1:39:18] oh
[1:39:19] what an approach friends
[1:39:21] i think it matters to god how we
[1:39:23] approach him
[1:39:24] the whole temple was structured for the
[1:39:26] right approach to god
[1:39:28] the whole worship that was given through
[1:39:30] moses and the tabernacle in the temple
[1:39:32] were always the right approach to god
[1:39:34] and i said god help me to have the right
[1:39:36] reproach and my approach to you will
[1:39:38] reflect the character that you're
[1:39:39] looking for
[1:39:40] inside of me
[1:39:43] man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:39:45] lord jesus i thank you for your word
[1:39:48] for your word is so beautiful and so
[1:39:50] perfect lord
[1:39:52] god every scripture every line the
[1:39:55] genealogies the the stories the
[1:39:57] histories lord it's all telling the same
[1:39:59] story over and over again
[1:40:02] god you've given us eyes to see but
[1:40:04] we're asking lord for more of that eye
[1:40:06] salve
[1:40:07] that we might see better than we've ever
[1:40:09] seen before
[1:40:11] you know when we see lord may we may we
[1:40:14] lord find that character that you're
[1:40:16] looking for and surrender ourselves to

[1:40:21] but god tonight we want to lay ourselves
[1:40:23] at your feet again
[1:40:24] and say lord break all of that
[1:40:27] selfishness off of me lord

[1:40:36] through history whatever it is lord
[1:40:38] break that all off of me lord so that i
[1:40:41] can reflect your character

[1:41:06] assembly here and the services and the
[1:41:08] ministers who will minister let your
[1:41:10] word go forth in a mighty way
[1:41:12] god may we come together again as you
[1:41:14] will lord and share the testimonies of
[1:41:16] what you have done god we just trust
[1:41:19] ourselves into your hands and we love
[1:41:20] you lord we surrender our will into
[1:41:23] yours and thank god lord we thank you

[1:41:41] all that's not you and chip it all away
