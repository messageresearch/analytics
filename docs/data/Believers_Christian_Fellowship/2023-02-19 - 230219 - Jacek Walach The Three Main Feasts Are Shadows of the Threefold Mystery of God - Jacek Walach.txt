good to be here together isn't it amen well I'd like to start the morning off with a special announcement I'd like to announce the birth of a new baby girl brother Caleb and sister caressa Schwartz has welcomed little rinley Kate shorts into the world amen so we're so excited for them and and I was thinking you know as at the birth of little riddenly now we've added to the assembly to parents four grandparents and a whole parcel to uncles so pray praise God for that it's an exciting time and we thank God for her safe delivery and that she's healthy not doing well and I was I was just meditating on that I thought my how a birth brings a dispensational change to so many and is the true in our lives spiritually too of birth brings a new title and with a new title will come a new manifestation we have parents who've never been parents before now it will manifest in their lives what Parenthood is for them how they display Parenthood for four individuals two sisters and two brothers it'll be Grandma and Grandpa and now there's going to come another manifestation in their lives with the new title and for these uncles we'll see how good they do amen but it's it's true in life and life you know the natural types of spiritual and for us amen a birth in our lives gave us a new title and then it's manifest what that title will be in us as we reflect that so it's exciting amen we're we thank God for what he's doing for their family and we rejoice in it amen I was wanting one one baby per month so far we're doing good but I don't know that we're going to get it this year but so far we're doing good and then also I'd like to say it's an exciting service because of the announcement but also at the end of service we're going to have a baptism we're going to baptize young Pippa Grillo in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we're very much looking forward to that as well amen I wanted to greet sister sabilla God bless your sisters Builder from Germany it's good to have her here she came in on Tuesday and I neglected the Greet her on Wednesday it was my fault but God bless you she'll be here for a couple of weeks so it's always good to have her visiting with us and as you know brother yatzik will be taking the service and ministering for us and so I've been very much looking forward to his visit we've had wonderful fellowship and I'm looking forward to the word amen God is so good to us because brother yatzik is here it afforded me the privilege of waking up at 3am and watching the funeral service for brother Gideon ratif and and it was quite a blessing and so just be remembering that assembly his family you know the it's quite a loss for them and I also got word that Wednesday brother George Martin from South Africa passed away another Pastor in the area and brother George also had a tremendous Ministry brother George Martin and I didn't know him personally but I had benefited from his ministry I had watched him a couple times and really rejoiced in the word and so it's a tough time for all of South Africa especially that area so I remember his assembly as well and keep them all in prayer [Music] [Laughter] what the human mind can fathom what seems impossible to imagine he's here unveiled and proclaimed so rise up and walk by faith place your feet on what you possess that's your calling in this age you're the chosen generation my holy Nations a royal priesthood in my purchased be born you're proclaiming my attributes as my Offspring part of me is in you long before this world began you were in my mind I unveiled myself before you no one could know me like this but you old days are past time for the new when in the cloud I showed my face you knew it's me for your my heirs came to take you back myself you're the chosen generation my holy nation her royal priesthood and my purchased people you're proclaiming my attributes as my Offspring a part of me is in you long before this world began you were in my

myself cause your chosen generation my holy nation royal priesthood my purchased people he proclaiming my attribute as my Offspring part of me is in you long before this world began you were in my

foreign [Music] here I am again [Music] I'm just to worship you [Music] if you to lift my voices [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] again just to worship [Music] to lift my voices [Music] yesterday today forever raise your whole [Music] day [Applause] [Music] God bless you Saints I greet you in the pressures the Lord Jesus Christ or the privilege and joy in our hearts to worship him in the spirit and Truth to know that God has come to us and he revealed to us his only chosen place of worship and how privileged people we are we are chosen generation and holy nation indeed because God Sanctified Us by his presence he came down and opened our eyes to realize that we are chosen to see him in this hour not just to worship god of History to worship Jesus of the history knowing about the things are coming we know there are great promises concerning a future but how blessed you are knowing who is he today to see he's coming to be part of his coming to understand that the bride how can Bridal come and with the media right is impossible in this age but he promised that and he is here to fulfill it so I bring the greetings on the sage from Poland from our congregation from the south of Poland we really enjoy the fellowship with the pastor chart last year he visited us he preached for us in the several places around it was a blessing so it's uh it's nice when we are part of the journey and we are just moving forward and just some days are passing by and still we are just brothers fellow ministers and we are just going the same direction I believe you can cherish also this Revelation that there is a brother or sister a side of you and we're still just moving the same direction we are still the same uh part of the same battle that is going on so this is really a wonderful because we know that God has got the skin upon himself God in flesh the word in flesh so this is really wonderful to hear the wonderful sermons and Promises even testimonies but to see God in flesh in the form of the Bride in the form of my brother and my sister this is really great we have to cherish these moments and fellowship like this I really appreciate yesterday the men's meeting I didn't expect at the beginning you know when I heard I supposed to be there and having a nice breakfast it was great and so once once again thank you as sisters for providing providing for us a wonderful food but I didn't expect you know I thought it would be more for the young Brothers meeting but yesterday I just realized it was from the 16th up to the 70 80 even more but it was wonderful I really appreciate the freedom of the spirit and the way when he was moving Among Us and I appreciate every brother and appreciate every sister and I appreciate you this morning and I believe that you you prayed and you are under expectation also to help me to preach to express myself I I need you I need your confidence your attitude your faith and then God can do something Among Us and I believe this is the reason why we are here to see him he promised that that he's be he's going to be here he's here already and you will see him according to your expectation so I invite you to open the Bible with me in the book of Deuteronomy 16. because of the autonomies chapter 16 from the verse 16 the verse 17. well you read the two portions one from the Old Testament one is from the New Testament my subject is that the three main Feasts are the shadow of the threefold mystery of God and I believe the holy spirit will lead us to the scripture I will say from the beginning I don't want to uh bring those things this is maybe uh could be a bit teaching but uh design my heart is to bring the word from a different perspective this morning that even the things that will sound at the beginning may be a little complicated for some of you not for everyone but for some of you but my desire is to bring the word of God with the help of the holy spirit in such a way that you will see it uh for a personal gain for the personal uh use uh something that we not just overwhelm you as like a doctrine that you say I don't understand it what I supposed to do to to to see the picture uh God will show you some things but you know there is something very uh personal in this sermon and I believe the Holy Spirit can make it this way for you and me so uh let's read from the Deuteronomy uh 16 from the verse 16. three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord die God in the place which he shall choose in the face of unleavened bread and in the Feast of Weeks and in the Feast of Tabernacles and they shall not appear before the Lord empty every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he had given thee so it was a very very important time and God said he will not come before me uh coming to the appointed by me place with an empty hand you you cannot just come with the attitude uh okay what's new today I'm coming to one of the feasts of the Lord what's new for me is prepared for today what the priests what the minister will bring not this way exactly you you couldn't come with the empty hands because you you you've been obligated to come with the offering according to the blessing of God and it was a time of the Harvest as exactly we are living in the time of the Harvest and you know the cities reproduce and we we cannot stand here with the empty hands or empty heart or empty mind we have to bring the offering according to Revelation according to blessing the lord gave it to you and me so this is uh one of the purposes why we are here and we heard about the three major fees out of seven will deal with seven but will be focused on the three major Feasts and now let's read from the Saint John Chapter 7 Saint John chapter 7 from the verse 37. Saint John chapter 7 from the verse 37 Jesus is coming secretly when he was asked to come he said no I will not come but now he comes secretly and this is a Feast of Tabernacles no one recognized him he's failed but some people they are aware his disciples that he is there secretly in the Feast of Tabernacles in his coming Saint John 7 from the verse 37. in the last day that great day of the feast and it was a Feast of Tabernacles Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the spirit for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified may the Lord will add the blessing to the word of God well let's pray precious heavenly father with him this as a wonderful privilege to be gathered together in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus father we just realized once again that you have chosen Us in love before the foundation of the world but you have chosen us a predestinated us for the adoption in the last days for the hour we are living right now father we are so thankful we want to give you praise and honor and this is a so important Lord because we are living in the hour and the age of the worship we just realized that a book that was sealed up is open and after the opening the seals there's a one thing scripturally the worship father We Gather here to worship you in the spirit and Truth we are opening our hearts father by the spirit of wisdom and revelation will just move and just work abundantly Among Us Lord deal with our hearts you know every heart you you know the every attitude you know every question every desire of every person that you brought here by your spirit father I pray May the comforter the spirit of truth will break the word of God for your people Lord I pray for that I pray for Revelation I pray for the word of God will not be a mystery anymore for none of us Lord but when we'll see reflection of Christ in the word of God may we will see ourselves in the word of God help us Lord Jesus bless your children if someone is need sick or needy or any time of uh maybe a problem or trial in his life father we want to put every burden upon the Lord Jesus Christ with a confidence that you take care for us with a confidence that in that day on Calvary you solve the the problem of the sin and you completely solve the problem of sickness we believe it father we trust you and invite you on the scene for each and every one of us father working through Us For Your Glory according to every gift according to every portion of faith that you allotted to each and every one of us we ask for those things for thy glory in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen so God bless you Saints take your seats this is your privilege you can rest I will try to labor but in the same time I'm in rest I I trust him I'm I'm I have a confidence in my heart that he is here and I I yelled at myself to him and I want to express one purpose one goal to glorify him by the message of the hour and say some things preach the word of God from the open book we are very privileged because the evening light has come it's not only the the book is open but also the evening like has come God restore the eyes for what would have an open book if you don't have eyes then for what you'd have eyes if you wouldn't have a light but there is a man that was able to turn on the light and I believe he did it personally in your life and this is a very very important when you listen the word of God don't think about the preacher don't think about the congregation don't don't think globally just be focused on the word of God the word of God is uh is sent to your heart to Enlighten your position to give you a deeper understanding not the shallow of understanding but deeper understanding we have to go deep deep and deeper because we are living in the hour of the rapture just to forgive me the there's a story I'm going to relate right now but it will just give a little light on the direction we go but um this is a story that probably happened um in reality there was a man he had a problem uh with a memory he was losing his memory so he came to the doctor as many people would do and he came with a question what to do because I'm losing my memory I I'm losing the you know the pictures of the of the past and sometimes I don't know exactly the details so the after certain interview the doctor he prescribed some pills and he gave it to the patient you know so the patient he went away and after one month he came back to the same doctor he said oh doctor just my memory is working perfectly everything is all right with my memory but the problem is I'm losing my side so after certain interview you know and uh the doctor he just prescribed some other appeals for his restoration for the healing of his side after a certain time the man is coming back and he said well um my side is okay my vision is okay but I've got a game problem with my memory you know the doctor you can imagine he was a little upset he said how many times you'll come to me take decision what do you prefer you want to have a good memory or good side good vision he pondered a little and he said well it's not so important where I was whom I met the history the main thing for me is to know where I'm heading I want to have a good Vision this is my choice have a good Vision good side okay so the doctor he was focused on the one thing and help this man but he's a really a big lesson for all of us you have to take a choice in your life you you can be linked to the past to many many things that happen in your life you can have in your mind the pictures of the people and the important events and different things but uh finally today I tell you it's not so important it's not so important what happened but the main thing in your life and my life is the direction we are heading what is your vision where you go if you understand the direction this is the main thing and this is little connected with the my subject about the three major uh Jewish feasts that are typed uh of the threefold mystery and it sounds maybe mysterious but uh by the help of the Holy Spirit I believe on the end of the meeting it will not be like this because as a ministers we are not sent to preach the Mysteries because the Mysteries were sealed in the Bible in the book of redemption and we we are sent to just give a pictures clear-cut pictures bright pictures for you and me you know to to come up higher to see to understand and I believe the the preaching of the word of God is the one of the ways how the holy spirit gives the answer for for your heart maybe you have some questions God knows so uh first I will explain and maybe uh definitely you will know many things but just to build out the picture for you to understand better what I wanted to say but God established uh seven feasts it's called The Seven Feast of Jehovah and it's very very important because it covers the whole religious calendar whole religious year in uh in Israel so that's how it started and finished it started by the first feast and finished by the seven the last one because it was only seven Jewish feasts and these seven Jewish fees that are divided for uh for the spring and Autumn time and it's uh correlating wonderful way with the first coming and the second coming of the Lord because brother blankie said this uh uh Jewish feast they are connected with the seven Church ages so it's really like a calendar it's it's really like a road map it's really showing you where you are where the Christians in the past where they were where Jesus was when he came first time what was about the people in the seven Church ages and where we are now and where we are heading all those things are really depict in the seven Jewish feasts so the first four of the feasts that connecting the first coming of the Lord and the last three are connected with the second coming of the Lord you know the first Feast was the Feast of unleavened bread and it was fulfilled of course in the Lord Jesus Christ Ministry in his first coming because Jesus he said I am the bread that came down from heaven and he said Beware of the Pharisees of the eleven because they are hypocrites they are teaching right but they are not practicing or they teach the people so Jesus he said uh do what they teach do what they teach but don't follow them because there is a a difference between the preaching and their life they are not living a life worthy of the Gospel but Jesus Christ he was a purebred coming down from heaven without n11 without any hypocrisy without any denomination not adding not taking away from the world so Jesus he fulfilled the first Feast the second Feast that was in fact connected very much uh with the first Feast the second Feast the Feast of Passover was a feast that was showing us a real uh uh Passover Lamb sacrificial lamb it was the Lord Jesus Christ because we know that in the Old Testament was a natural Lamb with a natural blood but it was not able really to redeem the worshiper all the time the people who are coming back all the time and with their sacrifice but so they had a certain relief but there was no solution this is the type of uh churchgoer there's nothing wrong with this it was nothing wrong with the person that was uh observing you know the the sacrifice that God obligated people to do if someone just brought their sacrifice like this it was all he knew it was all that was available but it was not complete solution of the problem of the sin the same is today someone is just coming to church or telling okay I'm in the message I'm born in the message I'm arranged the message I this and that I declare I just uh I take a stand this is nice but really what we need is a personal revelation which is a which is a personal experience of the new birth and it can happen only by accepting the perfect sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ the bloody word when you will accept it God is responding because the life that was in the in the real uh lamb the Lamb of God is coming back on the worshiper and this is a vast difference between the Old Testament and New Testament all coming on the New Covenant so there is a reality and Jesus Christ he fulfilled the second fees the Feast of Passover by being crucified on Calvary they're down Calvary it was such a realitybraham he told us that that day on Calvary solved completely the problem of sin for a True Believer when you really believe that it's finished when he said one sentence is finished it's really finished you don't have to live under contamination you don't have to just receive any Temptation and and think how I will overcome this temptation in my life you don't have to even fight with this you can ignore it because it's finished nothing can defeat you if you see that their own Calvary that he redeemed you he paid a complete price of redemption so no one of us should live beneath the Privileges we are so privileged people no they will be we are now you are the possessor of all things only because he paid the price of redemption for you and me in this day on Calvary if we are looking back messenger said if we are looking back and we are comparing and trying to dig in the past is only a proof that this day on Calvary didn't influence us enough because when you see the whole perspective how great the work it was you will not look back thank you okay I'm coming from this family on that family and there was some problems maybe I inherited something no it's finished so the Lord Jesus Christ he fulfilled the second the second feast and the third Feast was a feast of their first fruit and the first the third fees the Feast of first fruits was the type of the Resurrection resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ then when it was fulfilled it was the shadow in the Old Testament when there was a Harvest Time coming to the maturity whole grain and the the farmer could come with the priest and he took the the sheath of the first ripen uh portion of that field and he gave it to the priests and Priests he just waved before the Lord as a wife offering showing that there is a wheat that is reproduced that is ripened and there is a beginning of the Harvest Time and when God accepted this sheath of the ripened grain he accepted also the entire field it's very important to understand the third Feast because then how you can understand I am accepted in the action of the Lord Jesus Christ when he was resurrected in fact I was resurrected because when he was crucified I was crucified when he was raised I was raised you know this graying the the ripenberry chief was taken from the ground from the earth higher and waved amen there was a power a dynamic that was included in that feast but of course they had the shadow in the Old Testament they were depending on those things but all those things that were Justified the reality that was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ amen but he was not the end of the way amen it was just the end of the Old Testament fulfillment of the Prophecies of the Old Testament but they were also their prophecies and the promises connected with the New Testament with the end of the New Testament that we are living right now so the fourth Feast that was connected with the first coming of the Lord and was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ the fourth Feast was the Feast of the weeks the seven sabbaths seven stars seven times seven Forty Nine and then was the Feast of the weeks the Pentecost the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and it was a very important Feast because it was the second of the three the major ones they passed over that was connected with the unleavened bread and that was a daddy on Calvary and then after seven sabbaths amen God that was with them in the tent of the body of Emmanuel the same God the same Spirit move in the fourth face in the Feast of the weeks to go into the people it was very important because of Jesus when he came down first time Emmanuel God in flesh he was a great great thing but he was a God that was above us he was with us prophetic Ministry son of man Ministry unveiling of God in flesh great moments but it was not everything because God wanted to dwell in the people he was not satisfied to show himself amen by the scripture he was showing who he was letting them by themselves to just extract you know from his speech who he was because he didn't tell them openly our Messiah I am son of man no no he took a Moses and Sons and and the prophets but they had to listen carefully and he took maybe a six hours of the sermon but their eyes became open and they realized they are walking with the word of God it was great because it was a God himself he was above her above them he was with them but still they needed to experience something more so now you know the fourth Feast the Baptist of the holy spirit is very important all the fees are very important this is like a journey you start with the first Feast you have to experience a second and the third and the fourth and then you are coming to the six months of the drought in Israel not so much rain so we have to walk by faith but you you are uh recharged by the experience of the first four feasts and now we are coming to the seven Church ages long long way almost 2 000 years ago before the between the first husband of Christ and the second Advent of Christ and now we are coming to the seven month it's called tishiri and the seven month starts with a trumpet 10 days of trumpets trumpets with a certain message it's up to the sound of the trumpet certain sound of the trumpet gave a certain message but the different sound of the same trumpet gave a different message and that's a Paul he explained that we have to be train to understand the certain sound of the trumpet this is a war a wedding or whatever it is maybe Feast we have to understand if we don't understand you know the voice of the trumpet then we will do something different then we'll not do the service according to the will of God but we will try to do a cervix against his will only because we'll say okay this is voice of the trumpet but we don't understand the time the season amen but we have to recognize our day and our message we have we have to have an ear inner ear to understand what he's speaking right now so that's the way how for 10 days the trumpets in the seventh uh month now we are coming to the last days because the last three fees that were connected with the second coming of the Lord because brother he said the the the seventh month is connected with the seventh Church age we are living now God is going with the numbers all of you you know it so after 10 days of of the trumpeting there was a Yom Kippur it was a fifth it was a the sixth Feast Yom Kippur maybe we read quickly you know this just to remind you but uh it's in the Leviticus Leviticus 23 Leviticus 23 verse 27 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying also on the 10th day of this seven month there shall be a day of atonement Yom Kippur so you see it was in the seventh month it shall be a holy convocation unto you you shall afflict your soul and offer offering made by fire unto the Lord and you shall do no work in the same day for is the day of atonement to make atonement for you before the Lord your God so uh it was not the Feast for bring a sacrifice no because the sacrifice was already offered in a Passover and we know the Yom Kippur is a type when the two prophets will come in the tribulation period when the branch will not be here anymore she'll be in the palace but the two prophets will come and by the mighty voice of the trumpet they will just turn the heart of the hundred forty four thousand to Messiah but it will not be a time that Jesus Christ will have to die again so you see the Yom Kippur is not connected with the bloody sacrifice because when Jesus will come and they will see his wounds they will only ask him from where you got it what happened I got it in the house of my friends when it happened two thousand years ago he will referring to this but now they will come they will be gathered together to come under the seventh trumpet they suffer already under the trumpets they paid the price of the rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ because they missed that their own Calvary they miss their true Passover they means that through the Feast of the weeks that means the understanding what really Jesus who he was how he fulfilled the Shadows completely perfectly they will have to pay the price so we know there will be a killed in the tribulation period that will be resurrected for the Millennium they will be around the bride they must be there but uh you know we see that there are six fees that Yom Kippur was not a really long feast it took only five days it's showing us that God requires quick repentance you know I I'm living in the Catholic country 97 percent of population of our country or more they are Catholics so the Catholics are well known from the constant endless repentance that bringing no fruits because they are repenting for this and that for smoking and drinking and and every Sunday are coming to the church for Mass because they are obligated to be there they believe God is just in the church in the building by holy priest we don't believe it God is with you wherever you are amen such a priesthood is over we are under Melchizedek now it's a different story friends especially in our time but you know those people they are repenting repenting uh you know they say I would like to be better this and that or no fruits God is showing by Yom Kippur that he gave only five days from the tenth day of the seventh month to the 15th day he gave only five days of the quick repentance amen repentance must be real quick solid not talking about amen after five days of the Yom Kippur in the 15th day of the seventh month we are coming to the Feast of Tabernacles Miracles that was a probably the greatest of all seven because the seven is perfection seven is completion one two three four five six is not the completion there is no sign of perfection but when the worshiper was coming through all these feasts and coming to a seven one he hit the seven and seven is very important because we know that by sevens God is working also in our time there was a seven Church ages it was leaving the Seven Seals seven Thunders seven trumpets seven five seven seven seven leading us to a seventh day in a millennium yes honeymoon of the Bride the bride room you see the Feast of Tabernacles was very very important I cannot stress it enough I don't know how to do that friends but I know the Holy Spirit can do it he said in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the early bright paragraph four five four and four five five the Feast of Tabernacles was the last feast the seven Thief we are worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh Church age we are I don't know who is who but he said we at least we as at least more than one so program he meant himself and everyone that got the same revelation is in the same line of Revelation the the the unity of faith in the last days he said we are worshiping now what do you think now is not anymore now we see this is still now because the Seven Feast the Feast of Tabernacles was the last one is like a bridge One Foundation is here the other Foundation is on the side there is a river between the river of unknown but God provided a bridge and brother Brown taught us that the Feast of Tabernacle starts in the seventh Church age Amen in a seventh day and through the bridge of the Holy Spirit it leads us to the millennium because he said in the Millennium we will be future tense Millennium will be it's not yet will be in the Millennium we will be under the Feast of Tabernacles again in the seventh day so we need these Bridge friends we we have to establish something now where we are on the way where you are on the mat amen when we withdraw from Washington DC by car to Dayton until we met by the child and he picked us up you know so we we cover maybe a 700 or 800 kilometer or something like this being in some places you know if you would be around let's say Dayton you want to reach Dayton and you see there is a 50 miles to Dayton you are happy okay you know Direction but now we are driving let's say 20 minutes and you see 70 miles Dayton there is a question then you continue for the next 15 minutes and you see 80 miles then you've got a really a question you have to realize you are just wandering around Dayton changing directions but you really miss the only Direction we have to understand friends Where We Are on God's map we cannot only repeat that we believe the message yes which part of the message because there is a progression in the message even the angel of the Lord came to brother Branham in his life telling him be careful don't depend you are in the message you have a message you have to realize and recognize in which part of the message you are right now you've got the first part the body the second part the spirit and now is a time for the third part the soul the Inner Man the gene of God super race amen he was a changing of dispensation really a turning point yet to just realize I'm going away from the goal or I'm just coming in the direction of my goal that's the reason the vision is so important please forgive me if you don't understand always my English uh I explained last time three years ago you know this I never went to school I never learned English you know all I have the Holy Spirit depend on him but I trust that you understand what I'm talking about we have to understand where we are on the spiritual map and a messenger he said we are worshiping now when I say now it's connection inside of me with that great I am because when Jesus he he came he said he will not recognize that I am now not I am to the days of Moses or the other prophets I am that I am now he was standing there so it's very important to understand that the Feast of Tabernacles we are worshiping now under this Feast now who will worship worshipers worshipers not on this mountain that mountain oh brother you you went to this church oh now we are defiled now we are notified by coming to this church at other church people are afraid of the different things they will be defiled by meeting this brother sister man or woman no no no people are defiled from inside by the wrong Vision or lacking of vision but you cannot be defied and you will never defy the brother or sister you understand there is a Feast of Tabernacles going on in my life I understand I came to the seventh Church age I came to seven I came to completion I came to Perfection not because I was trying so much Holy Spirit Led me until now you know so now you understand uh I remind I reminded you a bit you know the seven feasts but the three of them there are major ones and they are itemized by Moses God said these three are very important extremely important is that every man which is the head of the house head of the family is connected with the responsibility every man will come three times a year to the Feast of the unleavened bread which is a Passover and you have to experience Passover you have to experience that they're on Calvary it must be yours not because you heard this hundred times or thousand times not because you are raised in the community they are talking about those things no it must be a personal revelation for you that he took my place on the calvary and now literally I can take his place nothing left when you experience that you are already changed person but it's not enough because you have to come to the baptism of the Holy Spirit you have to come to the Feast of the weeks Jubilee amen Jubilee trumpet we are free even you are free from the things you didn't realize you said okay Jesus he died for me I'm so happy Jesus Set Me Free but after a certain time you see some things that are attached to your life you've got the thought that you don't like you want to cast it out and you you're struggling you are fighting and and Paul he said don't fight don't punch in the air be more precise when you heat he's really the enemy don't hit the brother and don't hit yourself don't stand before the mirror and don't just blame yourself for everything amen there's a reason when the Baptist of the Holy Spirit is coming as a confirmation that you experience that day on Calvary the little Life of Christ is coming inside of you you are receiving the very anointing that was not only Upon Jesus but Jesus was that anointing there's a reason many people today they are coming and they have a anointing and they are looking for anointing for the feeling for the experience nothing against it but people only with the anointing they will be deceived finally but we have to become this anointing the bride today she became him she's him amen if you will become that anointing you cannot be deceived Matthew 24 24. you cannot be deceived it's just impossible why because you became him you became the word you've been a thought the attribute you became the word and this is not the end of the way because you have to come to the glorified body this is a journey and God helps us by showing us in the scripture in the word from the open book where we are but the baptism of the holy spirit is a part of the journey but this is not the end because there is a third the last major Feast is the Feast of Tabernacles after that down Calvary you are coming to the Battle of spirit this is not the end of the way amen that's the reason a Pentecostals charismatics they didn't realize the turning point change of dispensation allowed this year there is another age come up higher amen and you will see the things that are to be they cannot see it because they rejected the messenger with the message that was sent only to the bride Hallelujah to call us out from the Pentecostal understanding to the real feast what a change today in my country Catholics Protestants everyone they are receiving but the Holy Spirit Catholics are dancing prophesying and singing a spirit everything you don't have a revelation you will not understand but we have a revelation God unveil himself amen unveiling of God in Christ but now the branch is unveiling of Christ the continuation friends this is so wonderful when you can see those things you are so happy inside because you know I I didn't deserve for that I didn't deserve for the for the Feast of Passover no he did it for me above the whole spirit amen it's God he did it for me and now we are coming the Feast of Tabernacles the third and the last major feast the third from the three the major feast and the last also from the seven completion we are worshiping now on the Feast of Tabernacles was preaching theory about the Revelation Book of Revelation he said in the 1961 18 of June paragraph 208 he said this is the time when everything must worship remember how appropriate now don't let us miss this now don't let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of church age was finished when all the mysteries of the plans of redemption Seven Seals were open immediately after this now look is a time for all everything in heaven and everything on the earth to worship God this even was such a great event in the Revelation 5 when somebody was Worthy your husband your representation Kingsman Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ he took that book and opened the book open the Seven Seals there's a one thing scripturally you can find it easily in relation five after the seals become open there's a one thing scripturally worship Worship in heaven worship on the Earth you worship God Amen two thousand years ago John saw you he saw me John is typing the bride John also he saw himself but also he saw you the redeemed ones what they did what was they respond where the seeds become open glory honor Hallelujah because you redeem us it was not Angels not the Heavenly beings it was you and me Amen in eternity but now as brother Brown he said the world she was in heaven now is on the Earth all the sceneries moved down on the earth that's the reason it was a silence in heaven for about a half an hour people they say if I could go there if I would understand it if I would meet God don't look up so high he came down he humbled himself for you and me he came down to the Satan season he's looking for you he knows you by name he was the only one worthy to open the book when he released the seals he released the names when he broke the Seal of your life your ministry is released amen you have a Ministry because brother he said the broken sin means releasing Ministry now we understand what to do Caesar open I understand I'm part of the book I took the book from the seven messenger I ate it up amen he preached it was he was cut on the tape I receive it amen and now I'm part of it I have open book Hallelujah I'm ready to prophesy to worship give him praise honor you can go to the mega churches everything is Mega Everything Is Beautiful wonderful like laodicea and they don't need Holy Spirit they need maybe a Passover yes they need that Baptist Holy Spirit the Feast of the weeks but they know nothing about the Feast of Tabernacles but you know because the messenger connected you with the mind of God Amen you understand the things that you could understand before what are the privileged friends aren't you happy aren't you privilege aren't you blessed by God not by Man by God this is so wonderful it's coming to me one story about a certain Explorer he was going to a jungle creating a Maps measurements different things looking for the new places to put them on the map one day he lost his path in the jungle and there was a Darkness coming and this man he had nothing you know he was a very very serious and complicated situation but this man here the three matches in his pocket three matches and he knew if I will just reach a fire I will just lead the fire and around the bonfire I will be a safe because the wild bees will be afraid of the fire it's always this way the point was it was after the rain so everything was wet he had the only three matches so you know he used the first one didn't work sorry he used the second didn't work now here the last one the third one and the last one all his life was in this little match I don't know if he was the utterist or he was a Believer or who he was I don't know but I definitely dare to pray and he prayed Lord I have a one match help me now my life is in this last and third March and he and it worked he was saved friends sometimes like that you have to understand where you are and this is a very serious hour I'm not here to put a fear upon no one but the Holy Spirit sometimes when he's showing us where we are now if we don't have a light in the Satan's Eden the present light you you you will say okay I will just run to this man this is maybe the man of the hour maybe we have a new preacher maybe he is a solution of the of the of the moment no you need the the fine side you need the light inside amen you need something is working for you on daily basis for me friends this is the Feast of Tabernacles if you will not understand me that that's normal praise the Lord you have a pastor you know to to correct and just answer because on Tuesday we are going but still I'm available this uh today afternoon but you know the things I present they are from the Bible they're exactly from the message amen not in one place you can rest on this you know when the Feast of Tabernacle started naturally in the Israel it started with the Sabbath and he finished with the Sabbath and he had to be a real Sabbath no work no civil work at the beginning in the first day and the seventh day amen you know when Jesus we read the scripture when Jesus came secretly in the Feast of Tabernacles in the Saint John 7 chapter he said to his brothers no I will not go because they suggested he make it more public he said no no I will not go but he went that's how brother explained us that Jesus was a dual being sometimes it was Jesus speaking sometimes it was a father speaking they won in one flesh but Jesus could say no I will not go but if the father inside gave him a picture go he went fullness of godhead badly amen God and the man so he went there secretly you know that uh in the Old Testament when they practice the Feast of Tabernacles it wasn't for seven days so every day there was a procession of the priest was coming down from the uh from the temple Mountain they were coming down to Siloam pool and it was called uh Living Water here they they had a golden pitcher and took the the water that was called The Living Water because it was connected with the major uh fountain that whole Jerusalem was provided by water so every day the morning there was coming down and they took the water they were climbing up and they did it once a day there was an altar nothing about the sacrifice but they poured the water upon the altar the next day they did the same the third day the same the 14 was saying fifth day the same six are the same the seventh day they were coming down they took a water coming up and went around seven times around the altar and then they poured the water and in that shadow in that picture was a prayer to God for the blessing of the water for the next Harvest of the next year because it was the end of the year like we are now in the Harvest Time amen but there's a Feast of Tabernacle connect about the future yes that's what they did Amen in the last day of the great day of the feast it was exactly when they circulated the seven times and they poured the water upon the altar Jesus was standing there in the last day of the great day of the feast in the seventh day he was standing there pouring the water amen without a request to Jehovah please send us a rain for the next season in the same time Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink amen they had a little water they call it a living water but there was a living water in flesh he was standing there messiah in the face of Tabernacles and they didn't know it they practice all day things you know like they did it from the forefathers and the fathers and and everyone was doing that precisely but it was only religion because they got that introduced all these feasts at the feet of Tabernacles were standing there telling come to me if you are thirst let come any man that is thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so this is the evidence of Holy Ghost this is the evidence that you experience all these three Feasts Passover Pentecost Feast of Tabernacles Jesus he said everyone that believed on me as the scripture says amen what will happen in his life out of his belly shall flow the Waters of the Living Water that's what the prophet taught us the evidence of having holy ghost is clear understanding of the scripture you see the picture you see where you are you see where it's the messengers where is the the word where is how it unveils amen but despake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified amen amazing story he's standing there and they're still pouring the water according to our religion they didn't realize how the shadow became a reality we are waiting for four friends for what we are waiting what's your expectation Bryce Revival Great Awakening men of the hour that will just summon all the churches together what we are looking for I would say that what we are looking for is here if you are looking for messiah if you are looking for Perfection we are looking for the the last Revival if you are looking for the Rapture everything is here Messiah the anointed world for that age is here right now but don't look him around that becomes special anointing you must be anointing anointing is not enough anointing will not take the people to the rapture as the anointing doesn't take them to the field of Tabernacles it must be something inside of you because there's something inside of you from within you will hear the voice this is the way you're supposed to follow amen now we see the Promise being fulfilled it's from the sermon Christ The Mystery of God revealed Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning don't misinterpret what I read now because he didn't say the headship is going incoming in me he said coming in his bride Where is the headship what is the seventh what is the Perfection What is the fullness in the bride of Christ in the midst of his coming amen I'm sorry but the first coming was rejected handful of people recognize who he was even those on the end of his three years and half of his ministry they were so shaken some of them they left they denied completely who he was some of them are so afraid that like a Peter he denies I don't know this man he was a message believer the main preacher someone with the key it was someone under the people waited if there's a different opinions let's call Peter he will open the door but he said I don't know this door I don't have any keys he said to the woman before certain church I don't know this ministry friends but now is also even more mysterious is more complicated for the people in the life like your life my life your body my body God revealed himself he is dwelling inside of this man I know this brother I know he's a shortcomings are sorry we are coming to church of 30 years I know all those things even more than all the others right right it doesn't work this way they were trying to catch Jesus and you were trying to catch Jesus they caught him they said how in the world in the Harvest time he was going the Sabbath and he was breaking the summer and taking the grain stealing you know and giving to his own disciples it couldn't be a messiah he felt the pain yes he healed the person he resurrected the boy but then he felt the pain and he sit down he cannot be Messiah all the leaders don't accept him it was the surroundings of the first coming but Jesus he fulfilled all the feasts now is the time for you and me amen is a prize coming of Christ you have to experience that down Calvary fees of the weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles you have to it's an obligation you have to come before me know the empty hands no telling all the time I don't understand I feel it I don't feel it I feel it wrong you know and no bring the Revelation bring the word the word is already accepted Revelations already confirmed we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with a Divine Vindication we have it friends there's a reason the sight is hollering because he's uncovered yes in your life in my life I have nothing to do with this guy why we stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he has already judged that body in which I am part of how am I part of it here is it here it is it's in me yes the body the word is in me because I eat it up I was feeding of the body on the Flesh of the son of man and I grew up from the child to someone that recognize the Feast of Tabernacles this is the end of the end I want to worship him there is nothing more to do because he released your name my name from the book what do you want to do more be thankful relax yourself in the seventh seal recognize your day and his message we are so blessed friends peace of Tabernacles the purpose was to remind them deliverance from the bandage the Feast of so-called the Feast of the tense temporary tense that was built up for seven days and God said to them just leave your houses leave your properties your your big houses small houses maybe you've got some bills that you didn't pay yet for electricity and for gas ignore it build up the simple temporary houses like a tense fees of Sukkot fees of Tabernacles go there for seven days and rejoice yourself in your lord be happy greet your friend greet your brother greet your sister be happy ignore your problems God taught them to do that amen he wanted to remind them to you you left Egypt you've been a slaves over there but now you came to the promised land you have a piece of land you have a house and the leg and the ma Mountain maybe mountains who knows you have all those things but maybe you're a little depressed because you have too much so much so leave it and go out some of the field take a pine branches and and the middle branches amen palm branches they used it when Jesus was coming to Jerusalem palm branches Hosanna Hosanna the King of Kings is coming Hallelujah small group of people recognize what was the attraction on that mountain there is a small group of people today they recognize what is attraction on this mountain Hallelujah I don't mean only sunset Mountain but on your Mountain you are the mountain of the Lord open completely yes look inside you will see you understand Feast of Tabernacles we head from our theophany yes this is a tent when Jesus came down God built up for himself attend Jesus was the tent of the almighty one that's the reason he had to be crucified that's the reason the spirit that was in the tent have to leave him when I get someone a garden amen he had to die like a man amen oh God why you forsaken me amen they strip off him the tent he was naked amen but now we finish Jesus he said as it was in the days of lot so it will be in the days of the coming revelation of the son of man you will recognize something what happened really in those days what happened in those days three men came to Abraham when he was in the tent with his wife he rushed to them and he greeted only one of the three he said welcome my Lord welcome Elohim what it was he was a God in history of funny in the flesh amen God created a body for Michael for Gabriel for himself he stepped in and he came to Abraham Jesus he said as it was in those days you will see in the end of the history of this world repetition so Abraham he killed the cars you know he prepared the the bread and they sit around the table having a fellowship like yesterday we had with the brothers wonderful you'll say okay it was a goddament yes brother he said he was a God in history of Honey came to Abraham you will say okay wait a minute wait a minute if you are in theophan you don't eat you don't drink you're right you are good message believer amen I agree we believe it because the people the brothers he met in the sixth Dimension under the altar they were in theophanese and they said we would like to come down in flesh and eat and drink so how Abraham could sit together with the Elohim and with the two angels and eating and and rejoicing and being happy that he he honored my my home by his presence theophany doesn't drink and doesn't eat God was in the tea or funny living inside of the body but the body was a dust on the on the body was a hungry and thirsty wanted to eat and drink amen as it was in those days you will see in the last days amen very mysterious Feast of Tabernacles God can use not only one tent he had a 110 he was a Jesus fullness of God badly in flesh but he promised the Feast of Tabernacles plural many Tabernacles many tens your ten my tent amen maybe a weak tent but God is living inside this is the only way how you can hear from your theophany God and a Man became one again What a Day friends to weep if you get a parcel with a sorrow with a negative information you resign it always yeah so humble outside yes I'm rejected I am I'm alone no one like me you know I'm sick and I will never recover don't sign it don't sign it you have the tent of the Holy Spirit God had a desire before the foundation of the world that's the reason he created your body knowing will be a problem with the body but he redeemed you he redeemed your soul your spirit and the body amen and soon you will be manifested because this body will be changed but now is God in the tent if you can recognize it threefold mystery that God had in his mind is a type of the three major Feasts God wanted to come down redeem you and dwell in you and have a hardship amen amen by this three feasts you redeem you he go into you and now he is ruling in you piece of Tabernacles because the bride the bride when they are one amen don't separate them anymore they are one threefold mystery God is condescending he wanted to be in flesh you say in such a flesh like mine yes he knew it he paid the price for that he's not ashamed of you coming inside of you don't be ashamed of him Hallelujah how privileged we are friends aren't you happy of the revelation that Melchizedek is giving you that wine and oil if you are sad you don't have to stay this way if you are sick you don't have to stay this way receive him to your tent recognize your day your day and his message praise God God really thought about you God was condescending amen hear the spirit the logos coming to flesh of his own son but now he dwells in his bride he moved to his church what the privileged friends God bless you do you love him aren't you happy of the message are you happy of his presence message is not the history it's unveiling you are unveiling the fertile revelation of this message not the push and play Push and play is not the solution I was in the Bolivia La Paz over a month ago and there are 20 messy churches over there and we had a Minister's meeting at the brothers they said oh our problem here is a push and play Push and play I said how many churches they believed that there's that eight of 20. too much but he didn't teach us that we have to stay at home and push and play or just got it together only refer to this message because the spoken word is the original seat is still alive amen we believe in that push and play yes we will listen to tapes amen we love it and we we support it and everything but we believe in a gathering like this Ministry we believe in the apostles and the teachers and the apostles amen Hallelujah evangelist We Believe Hallelujah praise the lord we have an understanding we know that this is a God's way how to bring the blood of Christ to perfection to understand that all the feasts was fulfilled in Jesus Christ all the feasts is fulfilling me I believe it I'm open Lord if I don't see something help me open my understanding I I'm standing before you face to face there was a never age like this age that you can stand face to face before him you've got the privilege come to him it's nice if there's someone standing here the local Angel the pastor of the church is standing here I preach this is important but God is using a flesh because he's using the voice but there's no glory for any man there's no glory for any Pastor Any teacher for no one even said he's using my voice but that's not me he's standing besides me I will be mute like a trumpet you can be a you can be a violent worthy of five millions of dollars you can have a piano you know worthy of one million dollars no no really use you know there is no intelligence sitting behind the piano or playing on the violin amen this is intelligence then down the auction you know the price is going higher higher if there's a man human being full of weak points but God has chosen to prove that this vial is not worthy ten dollars on one million is going by intelligence that's all what we need God bless you God bless you brother sisters please stand up we pray amen what a privilege do you love him if you love him you have to trust him you must believe him in every word of God in the fullness of the word and this book is personally opened by your creator by your Redeemer and your

hour of partial this is the hour of fullness this is partial understanding or a dip in the Holy Ghost this is the hour of fullness amen that the the opening of the seals unlock the full potential that was in God's church we were bound up by wrong understanding bound up by wrong teaching amen but the true word is common the True Light is shined to break all the bonds that were holding us back from living the life of Jesus Christ the potential is in the seed it just needs the light and the water and the right atmosphere to bring all the potential out and we've received everything this is the right atmosphere this is the right hour he sent the water he sent the light he sent the right condition the warmth to bring us to our full potential and in the past they could only come so far in that Feast as time would move on and the first month they could only be in the first three feasts they couldn't Jump Ahead till it was time then as they moved forward they could come to the next Feast of feast of Pentecost they couldn't jump forward amen but we live in the day where we have to have Pentecost we have to have Passover but we live in the day where we can go all the way through the feast all the way to Feast of Tabernacles where he is tabernacled in me amen it doesn't it doesn't mean we don't still need Pentecost we don't still need pasta we got to have our Passover but we don't stop there because the time has moved on the potential is here we start there but we don't stop there we must go all the way Amen to where the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings the Holy Ghost himself alive in us amen that's what we want isn't it we have to believe it and yield to it and let all the lies of the devil be lies of the devil everything that would hinder our thinking everything that would hinder our experience just lay it down and accept the word the way it was given to us amen I enjoyed that so much I was encouraged in the word be encouraged amen we're going to invite Pippa to come back with her parents to get back and get ready for the baptism this is bower heads and thank God for the word dear heavenly father we thank you so much Lord God that you can bring an inspiration and

get us to realize who we are and where we are in your cycle of redemption Lord you do not desire for us to be stuck anywhere in the plan but you want us to progress all the way through to this very hour Lord when there's nothing left but the going away of the Bride everything else has been fulfilled and it's to be manifest in us as individuals God we want to release all of our thoughts all of our ideas are failures we just deny it all now and lay it down and we want to accept Lord what you have said about us we want to realize the hour we live in Lord and what you're calling us to and it's not something we're doing it's something that you're doing in us it's something we just surrender to Lord you're not asking us to be something we're not you're asking us to surrender to something you've called us to be you're not asking us to provide the power you're not asking us to provide the resources you're asking us to surrender to what you've provided you're asking us to feed on the resources to open ourselves and to receive what you've given in this hour so that it can produce its own life God let that be true in each and every one of us God I pray that you would just open our understanding call when you walked with them around the road to a mace you opened the scriptures to them and how their hearts burned but when you went to him behind closed doors and you revealed yourself to them Lord you opened their understanding to understand the scriptures you already opened oh God open our understanding see what our we live in and who we are make it not group but make it individual an individual reality and realization to each of us Lord God may we break free from denominational barriers may we have the freedom to be all you've called us to be in this hour dwell in US Lord we pray have your way with us bless us Lord as we walk in this world for you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen a bless your thing will face to face Ace to face I can see face to face

to face face to face [Music] [Applause] to face Revelations lies shining out I might densified today we are living an hour at least [Music] I'm so happy I've accepted [Music] by the prophet of Malachi for Lord okay can't you see you see my mind I'm so happy [Music] [Music] that was full [Music] fear of the night [Music] this is an exciting day last Sunday when brother Daniel was ministering amen there was another Ministry going on in the heart of pipa God was tugging at her heart amen and through the sermon God was pulling at her and and at the end of the sermon she was able to raise her hand and respond to the tug of God Amen and so we know no one can come to Christ unless the father draws him and she felt the drawing of the father she surrendered her life to the Lord and then she immediately wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so it's a great privilege today to be able to honor her request and help her to honor God's word amen Pippa because God has drawn you and you love the Lord and you receive the Saving Grace in your life and open your heart to him and now you want to be identified public by taking his name and being identified in Christ Jesus it
