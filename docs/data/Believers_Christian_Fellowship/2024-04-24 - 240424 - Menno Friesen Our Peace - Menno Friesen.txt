could be seated if you would and thank you to the music and uh greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be here tonight and uh I U I'm GL glad to be back here again it seems like uh uh we're getting to be that way that uh we're going to be more than visitors after a while we going have to pull a little heavier to do more work but we're very glad to see you all you know we we wanted to go to I I we bumped in brother Chad and his wife and um kind of hoping I wouldn't um but you know the Lord has ways I past understanding but uh coming out of a restaurant we were just going in and and uh so then he called me later and I was kind of I'd been with brother Wayne he called me and of course and you know how it is uh he said uh make it time make it time and then I'll we'll work around it because you know everybody's busy I know that too I'm retired now of uh pastoring so I've got a little more time to to say a while so but uh it I wanted to see of course you know it's always the Lima has a a special attraction and and um we don't we don't sometimes know but just as I kind of get reacquainted again tonight I've always marveled how how God does things uh when you uh realize that you had so little in it uh the steps of the righteous as we would uh maybe get to the scripture later but how that he orders them and sometimes you wonder why did I do it this way or why why was I there why wasn't I there why didn't I do that this way when I could have done it that way but then you realize that there's something that works out in our life that we uh we come here without we're born without character and the molding starts about the time we start breathing and uh it doesn't stop till we stop breathing and the molding of the shaping of the of the great statue that he has uh you know he knows exactly what he's looking for and at and uh the turning out I was U uh just uh before I came a month or so before I was I was going through some a little message several messages there somebody had asked a question you know how we do around the message sometimes we when we preachers sit around somebody said say what did Brother Bram mean over here when he said that and and where did he say this and so I was looking for something and and it was during the meetings that brother Ram was preaching in in Saskatoon in 1957 and um as most of this is this is the that was the first time I was in his meetings in 1950 7 and I was just 15 years old at the time and uh not really I'd give my heart to the Lord but you know what 15 the mind wanders a whole lot this you 15y old know what I'm talking about it's starting to take on the masculine or the feminist part and you begin to realize that say I'm not that kid anymore yet I feel I want to be but I don't know yet I want to be older and I was in that state when brother Ram was there in Saskatoon and I was only in two services but as I was going through these messages I heard brother Braham say something that kind of caught me and he said you know he said uh i' I'm following I'm following the leadership of the Holy Spirit he said I I I feel these are the meetings here that is going to do something and it begin to refer to the meetings in Regina before uh Saskatoon and he said I'm wanting to change my my Ministry in the prayer line and he said I had a vision here back in January the 14th in Lima Ohio so that maybe doesn't that make you feel good that he said that made me feel good I said Li Ohio you did he said yes he said I had but I can't tell the vision right now said cuz I'm still waiting for something and he didn't say what it was then the night after he referred to it again and uh hear you himm the message and the last message is love and he preached and he talked about the vision of Lima then he said another another thing I think the next night before he comes to the prayer and the third night he said uh I was in my room there today he said I wondered is I'm he said Remember the prayer meeting said last night how much better it was than the nights before and how I went through prayed for so many people and I didn't lose my strength and I was able to pray for them with those Visions coming now and he said uh I was waiting and I looked and I wondered whether this was what what that Vision had been and I went to my window and looked out of the window of the hotel the Bez Hotel I saw the river and there's a falls to the left and the Holy Spirit said that's the vision you had he didn't say while in Lima but said that's the vision that you had which you said previously I'm talking about Lima I said and here it is coming to pass here in Saskatoon gu oh my that maybe that's why I always feel going to go to Lima I don't know how we the first time I ever came here was in 75 year 75 with brother bisco the first time we ever came here didn't know a soul in the area and uh that was that's a few years ago now so many of you wasn't born and uh God rich in Mercy I'm thinking it's been my guide in my lifeline from the time uh when when God of course later on I got to hear Brother Braham in in the marriage divorce series and um I by that time was married and had a a family a wife and family Irene if you don't know my wife's name her name is Irene she she's sitting all alone there today but we've we've been blessed we've got who you know when we get to talk about Blessing about children we've got we got four children of our own and uh they have produced 11 grandchildren and then another 11 great grandchildren so now we're we're uh we're well we've got a lot of freezing around they not all freezing but we got them around us so we we thank the Lord everyone's a treasure of life and and uh we appreciate them so much appreciate you all and I appreciate your prayers I know many of folks we've we've uh sat across the table and had much joy and fellowship and I want to go into names because uh I'll sure run short anything sometime I S at my own name I I forget my own name so I won't try doing that but God bless all of you this this evening and uh if I could have tried to say something that is that is worthwhile because I do believe uh even if we read one scripture it's worth while uh because we have re we have realized by Revelation that that the book here that was written was not just a man that put it together we know that men describe it but it was God that put it together am and so so particularly that when he finished writing this word and we seen the angel of this age uh come to that point where he he challenged the world that this would be the age where we would come back to perfe Perfection of the word this would be the first age in its fullness for it would bring on the resurrection and the Rapture that this would be all the other ages now remember we know that the day of Pentecost was the Perfection of God coming down but remember that brid tree had to die to show that she had the same Zoey life in her that was in Jesus Christ when he laid down his life now she laid her down her life and in 2,000 years now been resurrected and back up to now and now we've reaching the age of perfection the maturity the full adoption as we know that and we've watched all these glorious things but even the prophet said so much that so much as a jot or a tit as the Bible say if it would be be removed it would either take the name your name out of the book of life or add the plagues of the whole scripture so much so that God watches over his word and you know in the prophet when he he preached and many times he would come to Junctions of life and he'd come to the place and sometimes he'd stop and he say I just don't know where to go sir is this the time he would say and they begin to preach things like that not knowing knowing it would be but when it would be and I think we're still there every time I've had several of the people ask me said brother man where are we at at this time I said I don't know but we're still on this side of the Resurrection but we're getting all getting awfully close yeah not because I'm old I might even fall asleep but I like what brother Braham said have you ever hear that you say William Braham died he said don't you believe it he might have fallen asleep but sons of God Daughters of God don't die they have Zoey eternal life in them ordained by God but so much so that we we realize and now we've seen the tree of knowledge has so caught up to the Tree of Life that of course that's what Satan's been trying to reproduce in his own way to get people to eternal life they don't want to die no more than we do the world doesn't everybody wants to live they're trying look at the look at the doctors and the look at the machines of this world they're trying to keep the people happy they're trying to keep them healthy and there there's more suicides and and and murders and ravishes and evil and more deaths and more hospitals and more people just crowding everywhere hardly you can see we got H Hospital in Saskatoon I when when I get a sick call I I I hate so where's that University Oh no I got to walk miles to get there first of all to find a parking spot then you get get inside and then you walk mile nearly just to get to a different wing and then you go off to that Wing just hundreds of Acres of of what we call better environment better places to be healed in and yet sicker and more sin than ever that's right and think of the Angel and all the messages never did change the course of this world but look at how man has got I got a little something played on me a while ago you know we all I'm not when it comes to computers uh I'm out of it but I you know I've got a few little things and tablets but usually my my phone is you know that kind that you hold up say hello is that you I other than that I'm not very good well I lost I did do I did I'm doing some texting but I lost the texting altogether I was in Arizona and said what's wrong with my phone said I looked at and said punch in your password okay so I punched it in and to confirm that you're you said I know I am me but but why do you want to know you know so I punched in it didn't work oh I said try it again try it again try it again and I said I thought I knew my well I thought maybe I maybe I didn't have I forgot the password I punched it in again and I thought well I know I had another password so I punch that one no that wasn't it three passwords that I knew over in my life that I'd had and uh none of them worked and I was thinking my I wonder if I'm way off or just a little off cuz you don't know I get when I got home finally I just couldn't I wouldn't work I couldn't receive any textes couldn't give any receive any mail and so when I got home I I went to the you know where do you go the place where you B bought the phone that's uh that's you know that where do we go when we have trouble the place where we started from that's why we're here tonight in case we've left something out and I went to the the desk and said oh said it's your password said got to go over here and they they they're the ones that will fix the password went over there and said oh if it's your password said well I might have to send it out we send it to another place and I said oh my is that serious he said yeah I said we we can't get to it he said punch it in again so I punched in what I thought I knew and uh punched it in he looked at it oh he said uh There It Is Well I said was the password right yes everything but at the end you had put a little explanation mark just one jot or tit out that's right well I thanked him very kindly and walked down and said the Lord said see that's e how close Satan's got it just one word out one dot out that's right now you know that all of us that's the way I seen I've seen your password everywhere you can't get in there unless you do it exactly the way you put it in there you know that's why I thought that's something the Lord said you see that's what I'm doing I'm honing brushing a little bit do a little bit more that's right he saw his lady stand at the end sinless spotless amen amen there wasn't one part of Creed in her she was purely unadulterated the image of Christ said oh you don't know it's that no but you see if you look at the flesh you'll never find it that's right because that one hasn't been redeemed yet that's what we're waiting on knowing that the soul must be in right position for that body to change I'm going to read a scripture if you would and uh uh if you could stand with me this is just um um the brother asked me he said what's your text I said I don't know tell you put in your own text afterwards I just felt like I'd just come and talk to the church and then I know once I read the word that's Eternal amen now I want to read Isaiah the 26th chapter for a little uh jump off here tonight on a few thoughts but the first four verses read like this in that day shall this song Be Sung in the land of Judah we have a strong City Salvation will God appoint for walls and Bullocks open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehova is Everlasting strength father thank you for your word and I pray that from here you would you would lead the path as to the words spoken tonight that would help us along the way in Jesus Christ's name I ask it amen you can be seated if you would I wanted to take from there that I so love that thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind and heart is stayed on thee not just once in a while drift in but anchored and settled and uh you know peace is such a glorious thing well I know we sing about it we talk about it we sang songs of Peace but the reality of peace is such a glorious reality that it it it passes all understanding when you ever get that real peace in your heart that you know you come from God and you're going back there and that you know that he thought of you before the foundation world for remember the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally not my sister nor my brother but it's me Lord he and I and you know we always like to have our name included in life don't we yeah we we love to hear our own name especially when it's good it's bad we kind of say wait a minute but when we the good news and this this this Bible this message is good news it it is the good news it is the news above all newses that there's not one single thing in the world can match it that can put a place a person in a position for rapturing Faith but this message in itself and I believe personally and I believe you do too that this message of the Angel no matter how the we've had all of the different doctrines around it bombarded and the the mystery has not been so much about standing in this age but to stand above all the fanaticism that's followed this message every age is the same I've been now a Christian what well preaching uh 1970 do the math some 52 years and 54 years and been preaching and I found myself that all these years has been a constant side wind and a headwind and a tailwind and uh sometimes Tailwinds real good but it pushes too fast and but it's life and you find that you just when things like a church pastor you know what I'm talking about just when things go real good watch something rise up see it's there to to hold the balance in things and uh it was all every time we prayed someone asked a while ago how come we don't see more miracles in in among the Christians I said I don't know God's the one that made the promise all I know is I believe what he said that's right amen if it's more important to just see the healing than Miracles then then I so I looked at I heard what brother B talk about one day and he said well said if if God would just give you miracles every time he said why we take it totally for granted after a while we just say well you know and I do believe we do when we pray and ask sincerely and if it doesn't doesn't happen we should be surprised right we should be surprised I had a niece I have a niece rather well she's not a kid anymore she's you know she's a she got she's around 60 years old but about 10 years ago she was she was diagnosed with cancer and uh I'm not even going to go into the details of it but but uh but it was serious and they they were supposed to remove ly glands and so on and and uh it was definitely not it was it was it was going to kill her and uh and one day she's in Joe she' been prayed she had got hands laid on every Anointed with O and she had Faith she made confessions constantly said with her Stripes I'm healed amen no matter how sick she got what the doctor said just said her with his stripes I'm Healed one day in a service just like this there I believe it wasn't Wednesday night it might have been Sunday morning she was uh there was she was sitting there and she had a great big lump on her side and she knew that it was moving into place where she would have to do something God would have to do something or it would take her life and and just while the song service was going on I I believe I'm not quite sure the details my wife women are much more on details than I am but I'm just going to go through this something inside of her felt like said why don't you just stand up and thank the lord well she was sitting on the edge and her husband was sitting with her and something you know something oh you'll be a spectacle and and you know he said something impressed her just stand up and Worship the Lord so after she about about the third time she got up and just stood there for a while and worshiped the Lord while they're singing all alone she was standing for what I understand and then she felt something just like come over start like the anointing you know sometimes we feel it said oh you know all of a sudden everything dissolves just feel real good and all such a piece of her faith come to her not didn't even realizing and as she sat down she felt like this and the lump was completely disappeared and she told her husband that feel this publicly she wasn't afraid she said feel it it was gone and for about five seven years I think now not a not a sign about a year ago they come back in a different place different area she went into treatments this time and uh she was going through the treatments and about she got in about halfway and one day something just said to her he healed me once he's still the same healer and she made that confession he heal me once he me twice he's healed me how many times has he forgiven me over and over and over is the same Lord she went through some treatments one day she told the doctor said Doctor um I'm just going to stop the treatments for a while and he kind of like nodded and no accepted and said yes all right we we we respect that so she kept taking checks and they kept going back said just we need to go run all the tests and run through and see how you how you've come along and just before we left here now or we on the road we got a text and said that doctor said we can't find a trace of the cancer he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised the next person he does not heal all but there's one thing and I always like this what brother Braham said when you and I as Christians if somebody ever got healed and if you meet that same condition God's obligated to his word he's obligated when when you saw a sinner find peace and if got filled with the Holy Ghost and you you know what he was like and then he was like what he's like afterwards when when God saved that sinner if he saved him once you meet and I meet that same condition have to do the same with us fill you with the Holy Ghost how will I get filled with the Holy Ghost he said he promised it you don't even have to ask for it you know that it said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall it goes with a promise you don't even have brother B say you don't even have to pray for it it's already a promise look at what happened to people that didn't have a promise yeah you know I think of Eve in the beginning when she sinned she didn't have a covenant God had to create one and make one or she'd have died right there altogether but you know the word that Satan read to her brought to her said surely Thou shalt not die she started dying the moment she disbelieved the word that's the acts that follow shows what we've disbelieved yeah that's right but remember and she had no Covenant that's the reason why when you hear Brother bam saying about you know how God came down slew a lamb clothed them with those skins to cover their sin that's the first time the Covenant came remember she didn't have the abrahamic Covenant then yet but David later on when he s what would call almost the worst thing you could think of right when he had everything in his hand he wouldn't have to do what he did but he sinned backsp that's right you know and when Nathan the prophet came to him and you know how David he you know usually when we think maybe and I'm just going to be honest like when we think that our sin is hid or nobody's going to know about and we stand say I'm not guilty I didn't do that you know that's the nature of the of the sinful nature first time you know that in a little child yeah right right mom comes to the closet and the cookies that she had set aside for the evening people guests all of a sudden there's a few missing when she asked the kids who Who had who took these cookies I didn't do it you know right there you go right to say that's the one the others W you make a move I didn't do it you know when David oh he was so ready to why said that fell said bring him here said we'll judge him right now kill him take his life take from him what he did Nathan said you are that man but surely you will not die use the same words but now there was a covenant that's right amen that stood for him it wasn't Abraham it wasn't it wasn't David it was the Covenant that stood for him listen here church tonight it isn't you and I we fail daily but it's the Covenant of the spoken word God said now what kind of a covenant have we got that was still not perfect or he would not have spoke of another Covenant but when Jesus died on Calvary and said it's finished when he said it's finished it's till the day you are transformed if you believe that with as a predestinated seed quickened and remember there's no way we can come to Christ except he draws us first no man can come to me except my father draws me first and if God's drawing God Drew you the first time something inside begin to realize this is not meise God I always said that I I I you know what i' I'd been sometime when I was young Christian I knew I was saved I'd been baptized but every time something went wrong I said there devil said die you don't have the Holy Ghost or you wouldn't be doing that I said Lord as long as I'm doubting it I know I haven't got it but I remember one day when I was pray and at the altar when I got up at that from that altar that evening and walked out of the church and on my way home I knew something had happened I notic immediately afterwards from that time from that time Satan has hit me from every direction sickness trial home finances Church breakups every direction but the anchor is always held I know that it was him that gave me the Holy Ghost and though tested and tried but it was an anchor and the way I know it that the desire of sin was gone oh yeah I still slipped and fell and still do we still do but brother B says you know what happened to you when you know the desire of sin is gone the desire to dis believe the word is gone there's nothing in you I know there's things in our lives that comes daily and remember I like I I I love the way the prophet took those things he said one little lady and you know the stories you've listened to the tapes like I have how many times you catch those little things a lady standing there and had the dream you know about her standing in the pure water and so on which I won't go into and but you know the dream and uh well first of all he said the interpretation said you're you're a Christian you're you're you're pure Christian oh but brother R I make so many mistakes he said sister you must not look at that you must look at your desire for he watches your desire he watches you as a desire as what is in your heart see when he broke down in Ephesians if you read that you know let's just read let me just read that for you I'm I'm read that little part in Ephesians is it's too good to bypass but Ephesians the the second chapter in verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh well you know what the Gentiles were heathens watch what he said who are called on circumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise not even a promise we weren't even included oh what how marvelous we weren't even included the promises was for Israel wasn't for us having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ oh the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow amen for he is our peace now that's what I like about I'm talking about peace he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us what what what did the prophet teach us in the scripture said about how when Jesus came he said he bridged the Gap that's right back to God he is that fountain that bridge that puts man back in Fellowship when they left Eden he's back in that Fellowship Church you realize tonight that we are at the very brink of the transformation of these bodies that there's not another church age coming there's just a honing down a little here a little there you Elders you know what I'm talking about you stood faithful all these years you taught your children you you raised them in Godly fear they didn't always go the way you taught him but you didn't change the word you didn't add to it you stay that God said so and I'm standing there I've got children in my own family right now that I'm praying for but God said so I believe it right there I don't have to change anything I don't have to go and say I'm sorry I said that the word's wrong no no no no the word's not wrong it's always right it'll stay just the same having abolished in his flesh the imity even the law of condemn Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself Twain a one new man Soul making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enity thereby and and preached and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that are nigh isn't that glorious Bridget Gap back now in this age look at all the message the preachers in the world and there's one true voice in the world there's not two prophets there's not two voices in the world it's not my voice or your pastor's voice it's the it's God's voice that's speaking back that's right we're not wondering if this message is right even many times it looks like something oh it missed the mark missed the mark and you know this critics are saying everywhere now oh brother BR was wrong here brother br's wrong there critics don't pay don't even pay one bit of attention to it you know what happened they just didn't listen long enough sir amen what seemed to be a question over here was answered over here you go back and try to find all the answers say oh in the first pull yeah oh yeah the seals are not open the Mysteries oh no it's not well you stay there and you'll die right there that's just like trying to go fix up the Methodist and the Baptist or the Pentecostal or the minites or any of them try to fix them back up again how are you going to how you going to do it when the the life is already [Music] left the life is no longer in Luther's message it's the same sanctification Same Spirit that went all the way through but you try to take this message you know and I'm let me I'll be very kind gentle loving I I am I am but I say this you can never you can never change the the direction that God's going amen just stay in the direction he's walking that's right from glory to glory to glory he's changing you there's preachers around this message that are trying to change the course of the ministry we're not going back we're going forward I'm all for everything I'm I'm for excitement for joy and peace and joy and but we're not going for any subject alone we're walking in all of the light of the world Amen stay right there keep right on walking somebody tries to isolate a little part and put pull it apart watch it the message doesn't change amen every time brother B when went to a certain place and said now I've walked till this place he said but now I'm waiting here it is then he come said now I wondered of all those things he said now here it is Sir is this the time and he went by there and he said now watch come back to this tape he said later on said remember I told you this this and that right how many times have we done that as ministers there's a little question comes up or little something then we go back and search it out and say but but he said this over here but it sounds like it's contradicting just keep it walking a little bit there wasn't all the light back then even there comes around in the remember how he used to say h th talk about the Seven Seals he said it's the back part of the book he said it's not even written in the book that's what he used to say right but about the third seal he said I was wrong it's written there but our spiritual eyes was withheld from it amen as Daniel had been told and John was told that it wouldn't be it wouldn't be revealed to the time of the end so he said God withheld it from us and didn't let us know all the Mysteries until this age but now he pulled it back and let us know then he took that mystery and revealed the rest the Myster kept on going kept right on climbing that's right am tell what what did we see Behold the Lamb of God Christ The Mystery of God revealed that's who's that's that's who we're talking let me read a part here in a little message and and you know I'll get to talk here all night and and uh but I love this little part in in uh the invisible Union oh it's a good one the invisible Union praise God you just think could God do something right in the midst of us and one get it and not the other one he could and he does am so we pray Lord include me include me amen listen to the little paragraph here 262 it said he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of God's forgetfulness by the washing of the Water by the word and the blood and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband of your marriage to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church he said he said no no he said by the word you might find that Alm like he goes on and and and kids a little bit said but not in God's word by the washing of the Water by the word how many times you tell us just don't get out of the water so but I oh Lord I'm still I got a little malice I got a little jealousy Lord that isn't right that's right you I let me let me brag about you a little bit here in Lim up I know you got at least three major churches around the area and I've gone to three so I guess I'm quite charismatic well let me tell you one thing God's very charismatic to his own that's right can you imagine him walking in here tonight and say I don't see a I don't see one fault one Sinise I don't see one there the only one can say that he who made the Covenant when I see the blood I will pass over you now when I see the token the life of that blood I will pass over you but I I say this with respect we've got to there too I've watched it little by little all the you know the pressures and the and the the things that that veered left and veered right in our place and I say that with uh with love yet respect I've seen it where out of a church six different churches would start just Every Which Way wouldn't talk to each other walk on the other side of the streets pay no attention act like you're rank Sinners or worse but you know what that causes you to do say God God be merciful to them Lord have mercy and there's no room for jealousy in the body of Christ if one prospers more than the other I you know the one that t talked to brother Bram said about about his church back then when they were struggling there and the brother uh you know on 60 the churches around Jeffersonville and uh we went to the churches when I was there I remember brother ve went and preached at one of the churches there and back in ' 65 so we would during the day we went and heard the messages preach brother brother veale preached in the evening in the in the sermons that brother Brown preached but that time everybody all the brothers still playing the same sandbox and we're all we're all walking in the light and what we had but then of course you know the message God pulls it back to see what we're going to do about it now I seen he he left it with us we said now watch you notice that God hasn't added one word to his message hasn't been one more word spoken after he finished that's amen cuz it's finished he that heareth my word the Vindication of the hour that we live in amen that is God speaking to the age out of this comes a bride listen how beautifully he put this here washing by the Water by the word right Amen brother Bram never corrected emotionalism he never said it was wrong to be excited and speak in tongues and so on he said just put them in the right place amen true remember how the how the gifts were operating and one would jump up and interrupt the pastor and so on he said now that's not the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit doesn't interrupt itself but put it in its rightful place and'll be a message to the church to keep it clean am every gift that God puts in the church is to keep it clean amen amen you know your pastor would appreciate a real good gift operating according to the message of the hour it'll keep sin out keep clean out keep keep all the jealousy the carnality out we're there now we don't need any of this where we're going it won't be there amen we might have a little bit of a here yet but he's honing let me just continue this you are standing complete completely Justified as though you never did it in the beginning now I know you've heard this many times but let's read it again and this is my message to the church now as we go off the air he said now for just a minute Are you standing said if you you're standing in God's word by God's word every man every jot every tit where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from the shuts 1962 there and it did pull away from the shars and get in here in the whe where you can get right before the sun I can hear the combine coming you're standing complete Justified like you never did in the first place Hallelujah he said that's a good place to shout hallelujah hallelujah amen sir you know he's never afraid when you say Amen to the word you know why cuz he's the god of the amen yes talk about Thanksgiving he said I feel real good now he goes on to talk a little bit he said there you are you're the pure virtual sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ believes every word of God stands through stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect amen the blood of Jesus Christ can how can it be if I was supposed to die this morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin because somebody took my place God amen amen we should still deserve to die that's right but he's not watching you he's watching the lamb he's watching that's a good one brother lamb that's good to say that I no I I kind of thought of that name I yeah Mine mine's not a good name freezing I hope you don't freeze lamb is a lot better than name but we're talking about the lamb oh he said hold true to the word all that spiritual union of Christ and his church his bride when the flesh becomes the word and the word becomes flesh amen it was spoken now it's flesh amen this Bible you know critics and and some real spiritual people from time to time when we were in the every once a while they'd Hold Up A Spoken Word Book and and the Bible said which one would you choose on the Bible calls it foolish questioning cu the two are one that's right there's not two there's not two Bibles there not two messages you're either the word of God I'm either the word of God made manifest or not amen for the Bible there's only one Bible but the life of that Bible is the word that's living in human beings it's expressed he continues to tell us here in a very very beautiful way all that spiritual union he said uh watch it just watch the Bible and say what would happen it's happening day by day why is accumulating so fast here in in these deserts and thinking like he's talking about his own Ministry and I couldn't even keep up with it we're nearing the coming of Jesus to be United with his church here the word becomes the word call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sined in the first place now that doesn't mean to a person who just say sticking in some feathers and say now I'm an eagle no no that's when we're born again of the Holy Spirit and the love of God takes over and the desire of unbelief is gone that's right yes sir God don't even know it it's in the Sea of God's forgetfulness he never did it you never did it you were accused of it amen now just let this really comfort you again you never did iten you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were the predestinated son predestinated to be a son and a daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of his existence even in the mind of God oh my oh we we've quoted this you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated word bride that he Washed by the washing of the water of his blood that become flesh and manifest and that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father am oh my when I see the blood predestinated in the boo just stop a moment and think back go out now let your soul Reach Out said just think I was in the bosom of the father before he thought thought and when the first time he thought I was there and sent out his Spirit but I was only it caught me only in this last age that's right but if I'd been in Luther's age you would have caught me there if I was in West's age you would have caught me there true but it brooded you and I out in this age of all the millions of people how come something happened inside of you and you've said you walked away from every Creed and Dogma that man put out this said now let me walk with the word aise when I see that amen oh that's beautiful it it comes to real close I'll just I'll close with it that become flesh and manifest that he might take you which are predestined in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was the great attribute of God God Called Love see brother Chad you just said that here that is the attribute of all of God's Expressions do you ever stop to think that he wouldn't have to do anything just man do it speak it but in him has so many attributes and you think it'll end when we get our Immortal Life oh my it's a whole new dimension I haven't been there yet but I get we we've we've heard from somebody that went across and brought back some evidence oh when he come back he said you know what I saw you there brother Bram said I he saw me there you know what cuz I'm a Believer he had to see me there I might have been very little but I was there I believe that I stand on that's my life that's my joy whatever you were you are a servant of God whatever God wants you to do where your place is if your place is here in the Tabernacle be the best Christian you can be walk with the Lord pray for your sister churches it's always good pray for the pray for the elect lady around the world Amen oh sometimes God just keeps us separated right now we'd become a great big organization so he just kind of shuffles us around and said just be humble wait a minute you're going to a land where you be one God placed in the church some Apostles prophets teachers pastors placed them there by the virtue of his own predestination and you were that to begin with your first wedding is an olded you never done it amise in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the washing of the Water by the word the word not the denomination wash you by the word but if you don't want to if you don't stand in the water in the word how are you going to get washed you're still as spotted as Eve was that's the right when I see the blood dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom Church of God be saved to sin no more when I see that you know David in the Psalms when he was preaching he was uh pretty excited and he he said fret not thyself because of unbelievers Psalms 37 I read it every once in a while it just makes me feel good then he said trust in the Lord and then Delight thyself in the Lord then commit thyself to the Lord then rest in the Lord that's right amen it's a good journey then cease from anger malice for the meek shall inherit the earth and the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you didn't make up your own mind to go a certain way something LED you and I've always marveled at my you know I you know when I first became a Christian we we you know you come with I came with a Pentecostal understand standing cuz my mother and dad were Pentecostal but they left the church and they were in latter rain when I became old enough and uh everything had been been done away with and made spiritual like baptism and the Holy Ghost and was like there's no more like no more covenants like like water baptism or communion or foot washing so it was all spiritualized but then as we begin to grow in the message I said whoa my communion foot washing baptism and they had always been talking about a baptism coming and I was think of some one man you know he would bear little testimonies but but one one was my uncle he was always so excited about about the things of the Lord and he was always walking in the light that he had but he was a bit of a uh you know he he jumped into things quickly and he he enjoyed him so much so and uh and when the when the truth struck my my dad came to him with a with a message and told him about water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he had been waiting but they were blinded you know the gospel blinds a lot of people but they were blinded because of teaching they weren't teaching that anymore said it was all over it all spiritual but when he saw the scripture while he let out a screaming he said that's what I've been waiting for said where's water the Ethiopian unic said what me here's water amen that's the Glorious part it's a glorious Church Without spot or wrinkle yes it's a glorious Church Without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the Lamb it's a glorious Church Without spot wrinkled washed in the blood of the Lamb does that feel good you know you've been washed by the washing of the Water by the word every time something comes in you rub into an area and you you you rub up to some dirt or some unclean spirit and he goes to washing how many times you change clothes physically you perspire you work you get dirty you bend over you you scrape it why you come home and say oh look at me what a mess well I guess that's the way I am oh no you throw the clothes in the laundry and said honey

getting the wrinkles out and he's done getting the spots out rest assured we're going to get out of here amen and so I just want to say God let that word press me let it get that wrinkle out of my life let it get that spot off of me because there must be a spot or a wrinkle somewhere cuz we're still here and let the washing of the water of the word work on us me what a day we live in when he's come himself he's come himself to make sure that he can take his bride by the hand and walk her all the way back home there's nothing to fear everything's right on time and we thank God for that man God bless you all it's so good to be here so thankful for the encouraging word that he's going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle because he gave us what we needed to be without spot or Wrinkle in
