TRANSCRIPT
========================================
see when you come into this life as a child you've got that golden bowl of oil in the human heart is that true yes golden bowl of oil in the human heart and somewhere along the way it's been broken i don't know any of us that can say it's not been broken it's been broken we know what it's like for the heart to be broken and the oil to leak out but what the prophet said is that can be healed that can be healed it can be healed and it can hold oil again that's the most encouraging thing to me is it doesn't have to stay that way that heart can be healed and it can hold oil again but you'll always have a scar will you ever completely forget whatever happened to you no we'll will you never think back with regrets and never think back uh at the difficulties will it will it never will the scar go away no the scar is not going to go away but to me the scar is the masterpiece because the scar shows that there was a god that could heal that heart so it could hold oil again the scar is what shows god the scar is what shows the power of god the scar is what shows the ability of god to take what the devil tried to bring ruined to but god can bring a healing so that heart can hold that golden oil again and you can love and receive love and you can function as a christian as a believer because there's a god on this earth there's a redemption that's taking place there's a power of healing that's here let the scar be a masterpiece amen quit letting the devil take your scar and continue to bring ruination it can bring bring heartache and bring destruction amen that's not why it's there it's there to display the power of god and all the attributes of god to overcome everything that the devil has ever laid at the feet of god's children there is a power that has been released in this hour and that is the full power of the full word so that we can fly a little higher than the chicken yard a little higher than the fence post so we can get up and say it's all been god god knew the end from the beginning there's nothing out of kilter with god i'm not damaged goods i'm a display of righteousness i'm a display of the power of god i'm a display of the handiwork of god it's the scar that makes the masterpiece
