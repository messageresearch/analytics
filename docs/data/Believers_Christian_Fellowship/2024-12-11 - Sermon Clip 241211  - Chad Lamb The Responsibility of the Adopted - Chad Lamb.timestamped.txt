[0:00] also Judah took Gaza with the coast
[0:03] thereof and ascalon and the coast
[0:05] thereof and erron with the coast thereof
[0:08] and the Lord was with Judah and he drove
[0:10] out the inhabitants of the mountain but
[0:12] he could not drive out the inhabitants
[0:14] of the valley because they had Chariots
[0:16] of
[0:19] iron it was
[0:21] tough they had Chariots of iron and they
[0:23] could not drive them out let's go down
[0:25] to verse
[0:27] 27 neither did Manasseh drive out the
[0:30] inhabitants of bethen in her towns nor
[0:33] tanok in her towns nor the inhabitants
[0:35] of dor in her towns nor the inhabitants
[0:37] of eam and her towns nor the inhabitants
[0:39] of megiddo in her towns but the
[0:41] Canaanites would dwell in the land and
[0:43] it came to pass when Israel was strong
[0:45] that they put the Canaanites to Tribute
[0:47] and did not utterly drive them
[0:51] out man this is a sad portion of the
[0:55] story We Know It starts the decline of
[0:57] Israel
[1:00] but Judah starts with great successes
[1:04] and great victories and taking great
[1:06] swaths of land and pushing back enormous
[1:09] enemies but they got this one little
[1:12] area that they can't take because the
[1:14] Canaanites have iron
[1:17] chariots if you read through it all this
[1:19] tribe couldn't fully possess this and
[1:21] this one could take the hills but not
[1:22] the valleys this one could take the
[1:23] valleys but not the hills then and
[1:26] everywhere there was little encampments
[1:27] of Canaanites left over because they
[1:30] couldn't fully drive them out there was
[1:32] some difficult things that just wouldn't
[1:37] budge that's
[1:39] right I don't know if you've lived long
[1:41] enough to have some difficult things
[1:43] that just don't
[1:46] budge but the problem is they put them
[1:49] under
[1:50] tribute the problem with tribute is they
[1:53] had a pack with them an agreement and
[1:55] they put them under servitude okay we're
[1:56] your boss you're our servants
[2:00] but God told them not to do that Moses
[2:03] said don't make League don't make a
[2:05] covenant with any of the inhabitant and
[2:08] that's what a tribute is they put them
[2:10] under League they they made a covenant
[2:12] with them and God had told them don't
[2:13] you dare do it it doesn't matter how
[2:16] many iron chariots how tough it is and
[2:18] how entrenched they are you remember the
[2:20] stronghold of the jebusites amen that
[2:22] would became the city of David amen they
[2:24] took Jerusalem but they couldn't take
[2:26] the city of Zion they couldn't take uh
[2:28] uh uh the the city of the jeites the
[2:30] stronghold of the jebusites they
[2:32] couldn't take it for generations and
[2:34] generations until David come along but
[2:36] under the ministry of David they finally
[2:38] broke through and took the stronghold of
[2:40] the jebusites and that became the city
[2:42] of David and listen it doesn't matter
[2:44] how long it takes keep pressing until
[2:47] until what until the stronghold of the
[2:49] jebusites becomes what the stronghold of
[2:52] the jebusites become an impenetrable
[2:54] Fortress that they could never rid
[2:56] themselves of it was always right in the
[2:57] middle of Israel and they could never
[2:59] get rid of of it but it was transformed
[3:01] one day why because of persistent effort
[3:04] because of a king on the throne amen
[3:06] because of Mighty Warriors who had
[3:07] confidence in David amen they finally
[3:09] were able to turn the jebusite
[3:12] stronghold into the city of David the
[3:14] place of the Throne of the
[3:16] king amen there's sometimes strongholds
[3:19] in our life because of things that we
[3:21] allowed or things that happened to us or
[3:23] things that we've got but I want to keep
[3:24] pressing until that stronghold of an
[3:27] enemy becomes a place for the throne of
[3:29] my king am
