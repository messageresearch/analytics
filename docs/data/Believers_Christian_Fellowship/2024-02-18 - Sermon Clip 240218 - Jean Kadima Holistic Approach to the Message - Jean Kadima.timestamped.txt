[0:00] and I I I used to tell people that when
[0:03] we lay hands on a people there's nothing
[0:07] in our
[0:08] hands and it's just uh uh obeying the
[0:11] Commandment of God I realized that maybe
[0:15] I was not
[0:17] right I realize that because this is
[0:19] what the prophet says and God's provide
[0:22] place of worship he said your hands on
[0:24] the people has got Quicken power in
[0:28] them if you have been quickened have you
[0:32] come to life has Christ become real to
[0:36] you has the power of God been manifested
[0:39] are you in the church God provided
[0:43] church are you in it how how do you know
[0:47] you've been quickened in it your whole
[0:49] thoughts your whole being is in Christ
[0:52] now and the Christ in in the midst of
[0:55] the people Pro proving himself alive
[0:58] proving that he's here that the uh at
[1:01] the days of
[1:03] Sodom then the prophet is bringing
[1:06] another aspect we know that we are not
[1:10] in a in a doctrine of laying hands and
[1:13] like like if we were the Jewish people
[1:16] but yet when you look at brother brand
[1:19] at the end of his life he more and more
[1:23] asking people to lay hands on each other
[1:26] that's right yeah
[1:28] amen well
[1:31] remember Jesus Christ is the same
[1:33] yesterday today and forever in all
[1:37] detail all aspect of it except the body
[1:41] that went to the grave but where is the
[1:43] body in you and
[1:46] I that's why you can
[1:49] say that laying hands on the people when
[1:53] you have a Quicken power that's right
[1:56] amen this is different from just laying
[1:58] hand as a tradition this is I'm part of
[2:02] the body he is in the body I can just
[2:05] lay
[2:07] hands my my do you understand who we are
[2:11] we are Mystic being there is something
[2:14] in us and the devil want to Rob us from
[2:17] it and this morning we are saying no by
[2:20] the word of God that the authority that
[2:24] the word of God give us we are saying no
[2:27] and God cares about us the body the
[2:30] spirit and the soul today we can get the
[2:33] victory because he's here he's in his
[2:39] body
