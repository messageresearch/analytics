[0:00] now we're back in the uh it is the
[0:02] rising of the Sun
[0:03] he says remember he went there with you
[0:05] and him see
[0:07] God never separated the bride from the
[0:09] groom yet so when God looked down upon
[0:11] the body of Christ he saw both male and
[0:13] female it was all redeemed in that one
[0:15] body
[0:17] that's why we don't go to judgment
[0:20] this is the reason we do not go to
[0:21] condemnation we do not go to judgment
[0:23] there is no condemnation to those that
[0:25] are in Christ Jesus
[0:27] why because I was in Christ Jesus there
[0:31] he made me pay for my sins there
[0:36] I you know say your brother Chad
[0:38] comprehend that explain that to me I can
[0:40] but I believe it friends
[0:42] I can't explain that to you but it's the
[0:44] truth
[0:47] so he says now he says he saw both male
[0:49] and female it was all redeemed in that
[0:51] one body they are one same same word the
[0:54] same word spoke of the groom speaks of
[0:56] the Bride
[0:58] all of a sudden this changes things
[1:02] the same word that speaks of the groom
[1:04] speaks of the Bride
[1:06] was that true in Adam's day
[1:10] when God said to Adam multiply and
[1:12] replenish the Earth that same word spoke
[1:14] to the bride
[1:16] when he gave them word and says don't
[1:18] don't partake of the tree of knowledge
[1:20] of Good and Evil when he says that did
[1:21] that also apply to the bride yes sir so
[1:24] the word that applies to the groom also
[1:25] applies to the bride
[1:29] praise God
[1:30] now
[1:33] this just opened up the whole Bible
[1:37] that understanding just opened up the
[1:39] whole Bible because now what what verses
[1:42] apply to the bride let's find the
[1:43] bride's verses you'll find the brides
[1:45] verses coupled in the Grooms verses
[1:47] because what he spoke of the groom
[1:48] speaks of the Bride
[1:50] [Music]
[1:54] is it the same word spoke of the group
[1:56] speaks of the brine well how can the
[1:58] Bride come and fail to manifest
[2:00] everything was promised of him
[2:03] and the groom come
[2:06] and he wouldn't be the bride
[2:10] I'm going to read that again
[2:13] so that it can hit home pay close
[2:15] attention
[2:17] how can the Bride come and fail to
[2:19] manifest everything was promised to him
[2:20] why because the scriptures that pertain
[2:22] to him pertain to her also the work that
[2:25] I do you'll do also
[2:26] right
[2:28] so how can the Bride come and not
[2:30] manifest everything
[2:31] that was promised of him
[2:34] and how and the groom come do we believe
[2:37] in the coming of the Lord do we believe
[2:38] the groom come the bridegroom is
[2:40] descended so he says now he's going to
[2:42] tell you what to look for and the groom
[2:44] come and he wouldn't be the bride
[2:48] so when the groom comes what is the
[2:50] groom he's the bride where's the groom
[2:52] in the bride what form is he in he's in
[2:55] the formation of the Bride he's in Bride
[2:57] form amen how could the groom come and
[2:59] not be the bride
[3:02] why because she's a further expression
[3:05] of the groom she was in the groom it's
[3:07] the groom's body it's the groom's spirit
[3:11] how could the groom come
[3:14] and he wouldn't be
[3:16] the bride
[3:18] this is what confuses so many people
[3:20] about the coming of the lord they're
[3:22] looking for the bridegroom the Mighty
[3:23] God the mighty Angels descended where
[3:25] did he go where did he go he's descended
[3:27] did he go back what are we looking for
[3:28] you're looking for the wrong thing when
[3:30] he comes how could he not be the bride
[3:32] because this is bride time bride
[3:34] manifestation this is the time that he
[3:36] is expressed in her
[3:38] man because she's part of the mystery
