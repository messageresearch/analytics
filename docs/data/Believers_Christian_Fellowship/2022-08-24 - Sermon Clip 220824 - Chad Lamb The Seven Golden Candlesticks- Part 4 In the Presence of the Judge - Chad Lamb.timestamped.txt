[0:00] there's so many times friends that we
[0:02] cannot accurately discern ourselves
[0:06] because we're deceived by our own human
[0:09] emotions by our own carnal heart
[0:13] and we think we've got the right motives
[0:15] we think listen when brother branham was
[0:18] going to go
[0:19] up on the alaskan highway up in northern
[0:22] british columbia amen he made religious
[0:25] excuses for going
[0:28] and he was going up there because he was
[0:30] a prophet of god and prophets of god
[0:33] they don't mingle with the people they
[0:34] don't do all this they go out in the
[0:36] wilderness and god gives a message they
[0:37] stomp out and they deliver their message
[0:39] and they go back and and all of a sudden
[0:41] he was deceiving himself
[0:45] it was his own wicked heart coming up
[0:47] with that plan
[0:49] and in the plan he was using scriptural
[0:53] types
[0:55] he was using he was using the bible he
[0:58] was using religious notions to justify
[1:01] his own actions
[1:04] listen you're not even safe amen if you
[1:07] have the bible
[1:10] you're not even safe from this kind of
[1:12] self-deception if you're holding a bible
[1:14] in your hand or reading in the bible
[1:15] reading the message but you're still not
[1:17] safe from self-deception because a man's
[1:20] heart is is desperately wicked
[1:26] that's why to have the white wig one
[1:29] among us is the greatest privilege we
[1:31] could ever have to have a judge that
[1:33] knows that heart and knows the word and
[1:35] can reveal the word and bring the
[1:37] solution to the problem and expose
[1:39] what's going on and bring the word upon
[1:41] the subject that's the greatest thing
[1:43] that we could experience we don't know
[1:45] how blessed we are and how thankful we
[1:48] are that there's the righteous judge of
[1:50] all heaven and earth the supreme judge
[1:52] is here amen the white wigged one is
[1:54] here the book has been opened the word
[1:57] is present and there's a loving god who
[1:59] wants to marry you amen but marrying you
[2:02] he's got to keep you in the right
[2:03] condition so that he can stay married to
[2:06] you to take you out of here and he will
[2:08] keep you right at all costs
[2:12] what a privilege to have the judge in
[2:14] our midst
