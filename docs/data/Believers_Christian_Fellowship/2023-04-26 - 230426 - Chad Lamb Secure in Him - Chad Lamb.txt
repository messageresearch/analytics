Christ's name we pray amen may God bless you this evening let's take our Bibles while we're standing and turn to Ephesians certainly good to be here again with you this evening as you can see we changed the curtains behind us in preparation for the wedding this weekend so be in prayer for all the things that are coming together for that and be praying for brother Daniel sister Caitlin and all that are helping and all the plans that need to cohese amen but we're looking forward to that also want to let you know that brother Emmanuel sabasu will be preaching this Sunday for us so I'm anxious to hear from him what the lord has laid on his heart so be praying for him as well um also I was going to ask for the cow to take the prayer request and give a testimony of past Sunday when he went to preach in Junction City so we'll just let you close the service in prayer and give a testimony at the end of service so I got a little sticky note here so if I forget just somebody yelled at me amen because I'd like to hear what what the Lord did there I mean let's read Ephesians chapter one together if we could Ephesians chapter 1 and let's read it from verse 3. blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ where we blessed in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love I love this I'm going to read this again according to have chosen Us in him before the foundation the world we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world so that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love praise be to God verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us and all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself who did it you or him amen God bless you as you're seated I love this passage of scripture he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love this means his love was extended to us before and we chose us in Christ before and now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ amen that's where our blessing abides and so we were always in him we were chosen in him we are blessed in him amen and and for a title tonight I'd like to take secure in him secure in him and when we look at the the this passage of scripture he chose us he hath chosen Us in him he God chose us he predestinated us according to the pleasure of his will him again to the praise the glory of his grace him again he hath made us accepted in the Beloved it's him again Amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen the thing is did you want to be part of God or to God want you to be part of him amen did you come up with a plan or did God already have a plan was it your will or his will was it your pleasure or his pleasure was it your effort or his grace amen when we read this passage of scripture all glory goes to God Amen but also all of my worry needs to begin to fade away because he chose me and him before the foundation of the world Amen how could I be lost or how could I I not come into the pleasure of his will so it's all gone it's all what God predetermined it's all what God predestinated it's all what he foreknew and he designed in this thinking before the foundation of the world and now this plan of God is unfolding itself amen and it's unfolding itself in our lives and and now the revelation of the hour has broke Amen to bring us back and do the proper understanding of what he did and who we are and how secure we are in him I was securing him before the foundation of the world I'm secure in him now amen by predestination amen praise God brother bam says and the message is this the sign of the answer that's how we can never die because we was always that's amazing what a concept you can never die because you always were amen now he's not talking about this body of Flesh that you dwell in that can die but you know when Lazarus as a Son of God when Lazarus died amen Jesus as Lazarus sleeps he didn't even say Lazarus died because Amen in the the Heavenly economy Lazarus was not dead because Lazarus life continued on in another Realm so in God's perspective Lazarus never died amen Lazarus just changed dimensions but then they didn't understand they said oh If he if he if he sleepeth he'd doeth well and he says no Lazarus is dead and brother bear said he had to speak in a language they would understand they only understood an Earthly language not a Heavenly language amen so so Lazarus could never die amen he could just change dimensions praise God so he says and that's how we we can never die because we all we was always we're a part of God The Offspring of God and he's the only Eternal thing there is amen you can no more die than God can die because you're Eternal with him this is not and once again we're not talking about the man in the mirror we're not talking about the body of Flesh we're not talking about the carnal side but we're talking about that attribute that was with God in his thinking in his mind before the foundation the world that's actually a part of God a gene of God Amen that is the original you or the what he intended to be you and come into a proper expression of that Gene amen If the fall hadn't happened but because of the Fall now that Gene had fallen into flesh that has now fallen and can't give the proper expression of that Gene amen amen but will come back to Perfection in the change of the body amen praise God so I want to read again and a message sir we would see Jesus he said and then remember if you ever was in God's thinking you're all you'll always be there if you've got eternal life you are expressed you are the expression or the attribute of his thought for this age if not you there is only one eternal life and it always existed and you and his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think what somebody else thinks it's what God Eternal you always was see in his thinking and so now it really doesn't matter what we think I mean I know it matters what we think but what we think can't change what he thought so we have all kinds of thoughts about ourselves and sometimes we have self-doubt and we have I mean sometimes people are afflicted with self-hate or self-disappointment or discouragement about self and we have all kinds of thought about self and we doubt ourselves sometimes we doubt our motives sometimes we we doubt amen our Salvation there's so many self-doubts but it doesn't matter how many doubts you have it'll never change what God thought and God never doubted about you one day amen that's just the carnal Realm of the human mind amen that that that is uh come wrong coming to the Earth wrong amen and shrouded in darkness amen that that doesn't really matter I say it does matter but it doesn't really matter an eternal destination because that was already in God's thinking and God doesn't change his mind but what we need to do is we need to recognize amen by a New Birth by the quickening of the seed and by a revelation a genuine Revelation from God we need to see ourselves in the light of the scripture not in our own thinking and we need the mind of Christ amen to take away spiritual Amnesia so that we can begin to think right and speak right and all of those self those self things can go away because it's the wrong self we're thinking about amen praise God that is if you're a child of God Amen in the smyrnan church age out of the church age book brother bam says what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer and then he goes to Malachi chapter 1. verse one to three and he quotes it here the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I love Jacob and hated Esau and laid his mountains as Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness now brother remember says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love that's how God can love you when you're unlovable when you're living in an unlivable way in an unlovable condition God can love you because his love is expressed by election but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation amen I I love the the Simplicity of this but it's so complicated in human emotional realms we make it so complicated because of the way we feel about things but the way we feel about things is not a reality because our feelings change all the time amen about everything we we love a hobby for a while amen and then we get all engrossed in it and we love it and then we don't love it anymore we love a certain sport or a certain activity we don't love it anymore we love a certain thing a certain restaurant we don't love it anymore that's human term human emotions are so fickle you can't base I mean I could be loving my day and if five minutes later I could be hating my day so the the feelings we have is nothing to base our Salvation on our Eternal destination based on feelings because feelings are so fickle but God Amen before the foundation of the world chose by election amen and now that election is being manifest and who he's drawing to himself because we were chosen unto salvation amen and you never find God God finds you you never run after God God draws you the father draws you to to Christ amen and so now that he's expressing his love amen by election a proof of his love is election so the proof of his love is not whether our day goes well or our day goes bad or we have blessings or or we have sufferings amen none of that amen is as a testimony of how much God loves us or how much he dislikes us amen his love is proved by election praise God and uh in the message the message of Grace from 61 he says think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters I love this thought love and grace is Twin Sisters you can't have Grace without having love they're twin sisters that's exactly right before you can have Grace you have to have love before you have Grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all love and grace and you can't see one without the other God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he shed his grace abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ghost there's just nothing can do without working one with the other so before you have Grace you have to have love amen so you say I'm saved by grace means God loves you it means God loves you you have to have love before Grace and if you're saved by the grace of God Amen and and and you have the faith to access that Grace amen then that faith is not of yourselves it is a gift of God Amen in the very Faith to to access the grace shows that he loved you before and he's not changing his mind amen because it was fixed eternal so let's go to Romans chapter 8. Romans chapter 8 and we'll begin reading at verse 31. Romans 8 31 what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivereth him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elected is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sore that is as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us how did you conquer because he first loved me amen and his love is eternal and his love is proved by election so no matter what's happening nothing will separate us from the love of God none of these circumstances none of these none of these happenings amen none of that will separate us from the love of God and we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord praise God let's turn quickly to John chapter 17. let's go to John chapter 17. verse 26. John 17 26 I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love we're with thou has loved me may be in them and I in them where is that love going to be in you and where is Christ going to be in you amen amen what is that when Christ comes in you amen it it quickened you to the love of God and you recognize your election and that God always loved you in the love of God abides in you amen Christ is God's expression of love and he's coming in US in verse let's go back to verse chapter 14. Verse 18 14 18. I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and he and me and I in you where will we be in him where will he be in US where will the father be in him so if the father is in him and I'm in him and he's in me that puts us right back into the love of God where we always have been amen praise God let's turn to First John chapter 4. so many things in the Bible that are being expressed to us amen are not intellectually conceivable so if the father is in him then he's in me but I'm in him now listen mechanically that just doesn't make sense who's inside of who amen but but we're not looking at things mechanically amen we're not here to understand things logically or or intellectually we're here to receive them by faith and he's speaking in a way that'll unlock a believing in our heart and we'll recognize hey it's all wound up in one amen how does it work I don't know but it works I don't need to know let's go look at first John chapter 4. first John chapter 4 verse 19. we love him because he first loved us the question is when did you first love us when he chose us in him before the foundation of the world amen and and and before he could have Grace he had to have love so then when he expressed his grace his grace is an expression of his love so we receive Grace amen we've received his love amen because he loved us before and so now we have the capacity to love him because he first loved us so if we say we love him amen it's only evidence that he loved us first then the message adoption brother Graham says I don't live true to my wife because I think she'll divorce me I live true to my wife because I love her it's a legal position that we have taken that we love one another first before it could be there it had to be love I love her although I believe if I done something wrong she'd forgive me I still wouldn't do it anyhow I love her that's the way it is with Christ if I live I'm 50 if I live to be 90 or 100 have another 50 years to preach and I never preach a time go down and sit on the river I'm saved anyhow God saved me by his grace unmerited of anything I ever could do did do or anything else I preach because I love him and I love his people so brother Branham is so good at bringing this back into a relationship it says now amen I don't have to do anything to Merit God's love because I had his love before the foundation of the world so I don't have to earn it work my way up to it I don't have to be appeasing or please him in some way to earn his love I had his love before the foundation of the world amen amen but now I love him because he first loved me and now because I love him there's nothing I need to do in the way of Works to earn his love amen or or to or to Merit salvation amen but now because I love him amen now I want to do things that please him not so that he'll love me and save me but because he loved me amen he extended his grace to me and saved me because he first loved me and now there's a reciprocation in my heart that loves him and now my works is not a merit to attain anything in God my works are simply a love token back to him praise God and so now you know we've been talking on this line for uh several Services now how does kills legalism because legalism to me legalism kills Freedom amen because now everything we do we do to get we do because we do out of fear of like I'm afraid of if I don't do this I'll be lost if I don't do this I'll be rejected if I don't do this a curse will come in my life or if I do this I'll be blessed if I do this I'll receive if I do this I'll get and when we when we come that way then there's really no unselfish love because all of our love is based on ourself so legalism is a disaster because if if my wife only did for me because she was afraid I would reject her that she's not doing for me because she loves me she's doing for me for her or if one of my children only comes and does an act of kindness and service to me so that in the next breath they can ask for five bucks to go do something then they never brought me a cup of coffee because they loved me they brought me a cup of coffee because they love themselves that makes sense so now that this the genuineness of Revelation amen takes us back into the genuine love of God that I don't need to do anything to earn his love neither can I do anything to remove me from his love my I'm secure in him from before the foundation of the world so now that's without Merit amen now now listen we're not taking away of the whole of the whole issue in this life of cause and effect amen the things we do there'll be in effect and we'll suffer consequences and all that that has nothing to do with God's love for us that has everything to do with our education in this life so that we learn how things work amen but it has nothing to do with God's love for us okay so now legalism is a selfish love it's a self-centered selfish love and I would say this too liberalism is as well liberalism is a self-centered love because it takes all God's love and focuses it on you and now you can do anything because God loves you and God will Overlook everything I do because God loves me but there is no love back to God and no Selfless Love Back to God so legalism is self-centered love liberalism is self-centered love but brother mantos truth is always right down the middle we love him because he first loved us and now his love is expressed in Grace amen and salvation election is the evidence of his love and all that he did amen and sinning has only begotten son into the world to suffer and die in my place so that I could be reconciled back to him these are all expressions of his love for me amen now there's such a love in me I want to express love back to him not to get something not for fear of losing something but just because I love him I don't pray to earn points it's not a frequent Shopper card I don't read my Bible read the message I don't do that to earn something with God I just love to commune with him right amen how do you think a wife feels when her husband starts spending a lot of time with her asking if he can take her to dinner and pours her a cup of coffee and and and and and asks if he can rub her feet and she's all sudden she feels loved and cared for and a few minutes later he says um the guys were talking about going on a fishing trip and I was wondering what you thought about all of a sudden you just deflated the whole thing she realized you're only showing her love so that you can go do something you're wanting to appease her and get get her sympathetic towards you because you're not sure how you it's completely self-centered and it will not equal love to her and if you and if you think I'm lying ask your wife later it will not equal love and in fact it'll have the adverse effect and I wonder how all of our our actions towards God how God views it amen and and sometimes I get tired of myself I don't like myself but what I want to do is I want to love God because God first loved me I want to serve him out of pure motives out of a pure heart and pure desire I want to serve him when nobody's looking I'm going to serving when there's nobody counting and there's nobody keeping score and I want to love him anyways amen why because he first loved me and now God has taken away all of our insecurity by the revelation of the hour I don't have to doubt whether I'm saved I don't have to doubt whether he loves me I don't have to doubt whether I'm secure I don't have to doubt whether I'll make it in the Rapture or not he's taken away so much doubt amen so that I'm not plagued by all of these pressures amen the revelation of the hour took pressure off the bride so that the bride could be a genuine bride and just express love back to him not out of all these fears and these torments and these uncertainties and insecurities amen the message came to take away the bride's insecurity and the real true revelation of the scripture amen was restored to us to bring back a genuine Security in Christ so that now I'm free free free to do what's in my heart and if I have the right heart what's in my heart is to serve God with all of my heart because it's a peace of God lodged down in my soul amen when it comes to life under the baptism the holy ghost that peace of God is magnetized to God and all these two things can do is pull one another together amen it's the word in me it's the word outside of me amen it's Christ in me it's Christ outside of me and these two things are magnetized towards one another if we can take all the roadblocks out of the way amen there's a natural there's a natural attraction to pull the seed back to the originator but there's always religious roadblocks in the way amen and the message came to remove all of these roadblocks so that we can be free to be who we were always intended to be let's go to Romans chapter 4. so I've said before and I it has really been on my heart if we preach the message in such a way that it creates an insecurity then I believe we're doing a disservice through the message of the hour if it if it makes you uh afraid that you'll never make it and I'm not talking about preaching that brings Godly conviction because if we're if we're not living the word if we're off the word we need to be convicted of that so that the the enemy in our life can be exposed and be rooted out because it's hindering us from our expression of love so I'm not talking about that but I'm talking if we keep preaching in a way that brings insecurity amen and and if and if I preach in a way that creates an insecurity many times it's because of my insecurity if I if I need you to need me so that I feel good about myself then I will preach in a way that creates a need in you for me you need to hear me I've got the Revelation if you stick with me you'll be okay amen and many times preaching that way all I'm doing is covering my insecurity and I'm creating an insecurity to cover an insecurity and to me that's deadly that's why I said God help me I pray all the time God help me Heal Me restore me give me the right Revelation so that I know regardless of whether I'm accepted by everyone or rejected by everyone that doesn't make any difference on who I am and and I have to constantly remind myself of that amen because there's times amen if I if I need my gift to equal salvation think about this if I need to have an effective Ministry to be saved then I have to create uh the illusion of effect whatever I believe is effective would that be through legalism to get everybody to look right amen then I'm going to preach legalism if everybody looks right I feel like I have an effective Ministry because I need an effective Ministry to feel like I'm right this makes sense if I feel like an effective Ministry is is looking the part or dynamic uh uh manifestations of the spirit I'll preach all of that to get whatever I feel like is effective amen and when I see that it brings the security back to me because I have effective Ministry if I have an effective Ministry I must be a Son of God chosen of God and be in right standing with God which could be completely opposite from the truth so parents can do this same thing to their children right so we have to be careful that we're always carrying the word from a position of security not insecurity that as a father we instruct our children amen not because I'm worried about what anybody else in the church will see in my son or daughter but I care about their soul and I'm ministering the word to the soul because what happens with them doesn't change my position with God does that make sense so it's why we we always and when dealing with one another amen we always want to deal in the word from a position of security knowing who we are and no matter what this person thinks about me or feels about me it can hurt it can cause me uh emotional distress but it cannot change God's love for me amen and and you know there's sometimes when you're preaching and there's things that you have to hit on the things you have to preach and people get quiet right because sometimes they need to be quiet and if I'm insecure in the Revelation God's given me then all of a sudden I need a response from the people amen so then I then that oh I'm going to get in trouble but I just don't know how else to say things then I will go to catchphrases and Cadence to get amends because the amen makes me feel good and people are amen and Cadence not content does that make sense and sometimes amen we need to sit quiet and catch the content so that we can say Amen and I'm just like everybody else I love to hear amens it makes me feel good this response there's a pool and talk when it goes dead quiet I'm unnerved it it frazzles me I wonder what's going on but sometimes it's just the subject you're dealing with that people are sitting and absorbing and it has to be that way and I have to be confident enough in my position with God and who I am that whether quiet or loud I want to take and Minister the word if not I always end up ministering the same way same way same way to get the same results because it makes me feel good but I don't want to stand here to make me feel good in fact I don't stand here and make me feel good I can tell you that Beyond any shadow of a doubt so that's why our security must be in him and nothing else not in people's opinion of me not in my standing in the church not not in in in whatever he thinks of my family not with what everybody thinks of my Ministry or my gift or my whatever amen my security must be in him and if my security is in him alone now I can have a reciprocal love and all the works I can do can be without false motive they can be genuine Hey listen I don't think any of us there are 100 yet but that's what I'm striving for that's my goal amen I may not have hitting that perfect all the time but that's what I want amen I want my love gifts to God to be genuine and without false Merit or without false motive I want to serve him because I love him not to get something not to impress somebody not because I'm I'm afraid of losing something but just because I love him that's to me pure religion that's genuine affection for God and that's really what I want with all of my heart and so like I said I may fail that a thousand times over but it's what I want it's when I'm present towards and I believe that's what's available in this age with the message that we have I believe the revelation of the hour amen came to take away the scare in this fear brother said I want to take away the scare and this fear you don't know who you are you're not will be but you are now the Sons and Daughters of God and if you are now the Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to try to be you are now why because he designated you that because you were part of him you were in his thinking before the foundation of the world he loved you there and he still loves you here amen so now we don't have to put on a show for anybody we don't have to perform listen if you put peacock feathers in a crow and call it a peacock it's still a Crow and if you put peacock feathers in your children to make them look like a believer but they're not converted they're still unconverted now I still believe in holding a standard in our home but what they need is conf they need to be converted not reformed they don't need to be conformed into the image of the church they need to be conformed into the image of Christ by a conversion so that's why we want to speak not to the flesh we want to speak to the seed we want to speak to the soul when we instruct our children we don't instruct them so that we can look good in front of everybody else we instruct them because we want to give instruction to the seed on the inside and see if we can Quicken it we want to teach them the ways of God the knowledge of God the word of God Amen so that we can draw a life from the inside out not from the outside amen praise God listen did I return to Romans 4 all right let's read Romans 4. Romans 4 verse 9. cometh this blessedness then upon the circum circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or an uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also so the imputation of righteousness wasn't for Abraham only it's for us for for what he believed God and it was imputed him for righteousness what do you need to do for the imputation of righteousness believe God let's keep reading here and the father of circumcision to them who are not of circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of the Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised so what Paul is dealing with here is he's dealing with the Jews and with the Gentiles circumcised and uncircumcised and he says when was Faith reckoned to Abraham amen when he was uncircumcised before he came to circumcision he believed God imputed at the end of righteousness and he gave him a seal of his faith and the Seal of his faith was circumcision amen and now amen uh Paul tells us that the true circumcision the true Jew is not one circumcised in the flesh but the one who circumcised in the heart so now the true circumcision amen is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism Holy Ghost is our seal unto the day of our Redemption amen but what is God sealing God Amen is sealing us because of the faith because we believe the question is how do We believe We Believe by Grace how do we get by Grace it's of no merit of our own amen it's because of his great love where we loved us amen always before the foundation in the world he chose us in Christ amen in his grace amen is extended to us and by Grace he's given us Faith to believe and by faith to believe he declares his righteous when he declares those righteous and sees that we have genuine Faith then he seals our faith with the circumcision of the baptism of the Holy Ghost how hard did you work for that you see it's not something you work and work and working working work to get Abraham didn't work and work and work and work and work and work and work to get to see you what he did is he took God at his word he believed God and his actions testified that he believed God and God gave him the Seal of his faith amen praise God we'll get into more of that in a minute and in the breach brother Venom said another thing a seal signifies is ownership so Abraham believed we believed God it was imputed him for righteousness and God sealed his faith with the Seal of circumcision if we believe God now listen Abraham it didn't say Abraham believed in God Abraham believed God and to believe God is to believe the present tense truth of God to believe what God is saying and doing right now so he believed God and it was imputed in the Horizon as he was justified by faith through Grace by the grace of God he was given the ability to believe by faith amen now he's Justified declared righteous and then after that God put a seal God gave him a seal of circumcision for us when we believe God God now will if he recognizes our faith he'll seal it with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he will do it praise God another thing a seal signifies is ownership the seal has a mark on it shows ownership so it shows who you belong to when you're bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world you are owned by God and another thing is a seal is a security seal means you are secured now you that don't believe in eternal security I don't know but a seal signifies security to its destination woe unto that guy that would try to break that seal and the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken what is a seal a seal shows ownership amen if you're sealed by the Holy Ghost you belong to God Amen and a seal also is security to its destination amen and that's why that seal will not be broke until I die and when I die I go to my theophany or when my body changes I and I meet my theophany amen that's when that seal will be broken for me until then I'll be under the Seal of God amen let's keep going and I got a few comments I want to make but I want to read a few other things and the message the baptism of the holy spirit says well you say now brother Branham I guess once and Grace always in grace that brings a lot of disgrace but when a man or woman has been born of the spirit of God old things have passed away All Things become new and he's been birthed and blessed by the Eternal God and they can no more perish than God himself can perish why because you were with God before it's God's love expressed to you amen and and if you have faith where did you get Faith it's a gift of God it's Ephesians 2 8 if you have faith to believe the word for your day where did you get that Faith amen you got that faith by grace amen by Grace amen we're saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God who gave you the faith to believe it came from God because he chose you in him before the foundation of the world you believe there so now you're here when the word comes to you you believe here amen and when you believe in a genuine faith in the genuine word of God Amen and you come God's provided way and God recognizes your faith when he recognizes your faith as genuine Faith he will put a seal upon you and that seal is the Holy Ghost and it shows he owns you and you're sealed to your destination praise God huh so there's a a message that I was looking at and studying there's a little bitty short message in 1964 and July 5th 1964. and it's a little recorded message called private interview if you haven't listened to it I encourage you to go listen to it and in private energy brother Branham is just before he preaches uh the Masterpiece in 1964. he has an interview a private interview with with Georgia Bruce and I just took a couple excorts out of that because I love the way brother Benham deals with this sister and and it it breaks out the conversation between sister Georgia and brother Branham and sister Georgia Bruce says brother Brandon most of all I want the experience that I've been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart she's questioning whether she's been skilled or not and she's asking God to reveal it to brother Branham so brother Branham can tell her here's what he says I believe with all my heart that you are a real born-again believer sister Bruce praise God how could that Spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary you're a nervous type person this is what I love this woman comes to brother Ben and brother Branham already says he says a few things in there that I'm not going to get into but he he's already saying amen I see your life I watched your life as your Shepherd if I thought there was anything wrong I'd let you know I've watched you for years sister and I've seen the Lord Heal you and brother Brandon now he makes a statement I believe with all my heart that you're a real Born Again believer sister Bruce but then he begins to tell her what she's struggling with what she's struggling with is not that she's not born again what she's struggling with is her own nervous nature and her own nervous nature is creating a question in her mind but there's no question in brother branham's mind there's no question in God's mind there's only a question here because she's a nervous type person this is what I love the proud of God Is So explaining amen what's going on in this sister's life amen so that she can get over this flesh so he says he says when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type person Bruce says yes and you get things on your mind see little bitty things it just keeps building up both ways you're going to talk about the positive and negative both ways you'll get somebody on your heart you want to pray for them and get up and pray for you can't rest till you get that person prayed for that's you then take on the other side Satan Maybe Might present something that you and out this way see and then then see you you're a nature and God works and Satan works then when Satan tries to make you believe that you're Nazi you keep building this and maybe this and this and don't look at yourself sister Bruce says the devil's playing on that nervous nature you have God uses it and the devil uses it because when you get somebody on your mind you can't get them off your mind it just rolls around your mind till you get up and pray for him and then it gets off your mind but that same thing the devil uses to torment you and it begins to get you to down and then you say maybe this and now this and you start adding everything together I love this so glad God allowed this to be on tape and delivered for us he says now don't look at yourself sister Bruce this is an amazing piece of advice let's go to Colossians chapter one Colossians chapter 1 and verse 19. Colossians 1 and 19. for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unprovable in his sight listen the reason that he suffered and died on Calvary is so that he can present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight not by your actions or deeds but by his action indeed but I want to look at this carefully between verse 21 and verse 22 because there's there's a truth here that brother Brennan points to if you look at the word reconciled at the end of verse 21 and and I'll ask you is there any punctuation there period comma anything nothing so that means 21 and 22 are the same sentence there's no punctuation there's no change of thought so let's keep reading and you were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now Hatha reconciled in the body of his flesh through death so where were you when he died you were in the body of his death that's why brother Ben said when he went to Calvary you were in him amen so you were reconciled you and you were enemies in Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh you were there through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in the sight brother Benham said God already made me pay for my sins when I was in him there and God doesn't make a man go to judgment twice there's no devil jeopardy with God is what brother bam says amen he doesn't make a God good a man go to judgment twice amen it's already been paid for amen and I'm already standing in judgment now what I choose what I believe in my expression amen and already declares whether I'm just or guilty amen but my my faith in the word of God has declared me righteous amen because of imputation because of Grace giving me Faith to believe the word amen and so all my wrongs was paid for there where was I there I was in him in his mind so I was Secure in the mind of God is that eternal security absolutely I was Secure in his thoughts before the foundation in the world then I was in him at Calvary and now I'm secure in him at Calvary and now I'm in him spiritually by the baptism of Holy Ghost he's in me and I'm in him and I'm still securing him I'm securing him there I was insecuring him there and I'm insecuring him here because of what he's done and provided for me now let's look at verse 21 again uh verse 22 sorry in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith why because if you discontinue the faith it shows that you never had faith because faith is a revelation the sea was never quickened because that seed is the word and can only agree with the word so this is this is clear so this is not once you make a declaration and once you make a statement then you're it forever know your life after that will declare if that was genuine or not because you can say things and you can have experiences and you can you can have all kinds of emotions and workups and all kinds of things that happen amen but if it doesn't stick that wasn't it because it's a new birth a regeneration a new life and that new life continues on not that you don't backside make mistakes have feelings that's not what I'm talking about but that new birth that Holy Ghost will bring you back to a quick repentance and you keep moving down the path so if you walk away amen it shows that it wasn't for you so as he says you were reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable and reproval and insight if you continue in the faith not if you keep doing good deeds no you're continuing to face shows what's inside of you and if that seed was inside of you then that seed was inside of him at Calvary same thing praise God if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where of I Parliament made a minister Amen brother bam says in the message the God of this evil age he says in God's Own thinking God the great spirit in the beginning before there was a beginning he was gone and did you know you were in him then if you're a Christian now you was in him then and if that be so the whole God had bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then I like reading this he's got the authority to make a statement like that amen I don't have the authority to make a statement like that but praise God he unlocked the mystery so that the bride can declare the mystery when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later and we was at Calvary with him I was Secure in him in his thinking I was Secure in him at Calvary I'm secured by the new birth in him now we was at Calvary with him we went in the grave with him we raised with him and in Resurrection and now we've ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus always I'm secure in him in Heavenly places now and he's in me and the father's in him and I'm in him praise God let me go back to the interview with sister Bruce the next David sister Bruce makes it says but she says listen but I've never had an experience that I have been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on I love this all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being that was your nature it changed once but what changed it and sister Bruce says Christ there you are sister that's it I want to read that again because it might have just skimmed over top the heads it's so simple she says I want to read her question again but I've never had an experience that I have been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on she's not saying she hasn't had any experiences she doesn't have one she can put her foot on and say this is it I've never had an experience that I have been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce says yes that was your nature it changed once but what changed it she says Christ there you are sister see that's it then he goes right to the scripture he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but hath passed he hath past tense past from Death To Life Saint John 5 24 Jesus speaking see look where brother Branham takes her confidence immediately brother Brenham never says did you speak in tongues did you have this experience did you have that immediately brother Branham asked her if her nature changed she said who changed it she said Christ then he goes right to the scriptures because he has to give her security that will not change he has to give her something her faith can rest upon and Faith only rests upon the word of God emotional things come and go but the word of God doesn't change so he goes right to the scripture he that heareth my words and believing on him that sent me half Eternal you already have it amen and shall not come to the Judgment but past tense pass from death into life praise God here's what brother remember says in the message of God's preparation from 1954 he said but look if you've gotten if you've got not brother Branham but if you've got thus saith the Lord just let the storms howl and you say I got saved brother Madam I I know I did because I felt real good the devil can beat you around the stump every day on that because at some point you'll feel really bad and at some point you'll make a really bad mistake he said the devil will beat you on a stump every day on that I'm not saved because I feel real good I'm not saved because I shout I'm not saved because I see Visions I'm not saved because I preached the gospel I'm saved because I've met the conditions of God's word and he goes right into the scripture he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life the devil can't beat you around on that that's thus saith the Lord meeting him right in the face praise God where did brother man go to the scriptures amen where is the foundation in the word amen what has God done for us he's open to us the word so that we can have a security that nothing else will bring everything else can be doubted the word can't be doubted now praise God I'm saved because I meet the condition of God's word I have come God's provided way I believe not because I tried or I want to but I just believed amen and then I changed God did something something brother Graham says something actually happened it's not it's not like you say well I believe that you just keep moving on and there's absolutely no change in life amen that's not what brother Bear's talking about there has to be a change amen the seed Quicken a new birth a transition something on the inside actually has to change that's the experience of the new birth is a change amen so it's not like a a a a Reformation or a mental agreement and we come to the statutes of the church or even the the teachings of the message and now we come and we line up with all of that but if there's no change on the inside then there's not a change there's got to be a change on the inside Hallelujah that's what brother Ben said to Sister Bruce you changed you changed didn't you in the masterpiece brother Branham has this interview with sister Bruce and he goes immediately out and he preaches the Masterpiece and in this quote he's referring back to his interview with sister Bruce says now we find that the antelopean world came along and destroyed the whole thing because the covenants that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this or if you will do that God the great sculptor seen that man could not could not keep a covenant he just can't do it there's just no way at all on the interview a few moments ago he's speaking about sister Bruce's interview on the interview a few moments ago I was speaking to a person in the room that's present now said but brother Branham I have so many things I know that's wrong and a Godly little woman and what she said to brother bear says but brother Branham I make so many mistakes that was her objection brother pointed to her changed life pointed to the word but her objection to what brother man I'm saying was but I make so many mistakes now look at what he says here he's referring back to the interview I said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus see he made a way Amen brother manmaster she said I make some mistakes he says yeah but what's your desire she says I loved him with all my heart he said that's what he's looking at he's looking at what you are on the inside not what you are on the outside God can take care he's already taken care of this Fallen flesh and the Fallen flesh condition and all that goes with it he's looking at what you genuinely are on the inside that's what matters and the new birth brings the genuine seed to a genuine life that's what he's looking at and it changes your desires from what it was amen now everything in you wants to love him and please him and serve him with all of your heart and though you make mistakes like sister Bruce did she makes a lot of mistakes those you make a lot of mistakes amen you realize that that's what the blood is for amen may he make a lot of mistakes but it doesn't change my desire and I hate my mistakes before I loved my mistakes or at least I had no problem walking in them continually at least now I've got to turn from I got to make it right I've got to repent I gotta tell God I'm sorry I I can't just go on like that anymore why because my desires have changed amen in the message the conflict between God and Satan from 1962 the prophet says don't reason don't try to reason it it hasn't got no reasonings you just believe it you don't reason a thing because remember the only way that you can accept God Is by faith not by reasons not by understanding not able to explain you don't explain nothing you believe something I love that he says not what you feel Jesus that Jesus never said did you feel it he said did you believe it that's right you just believe what God Said I can't explain to you how how the greatest miracle that I can think of is a man who just like take a pig and tell that pig you know you're no more a pig you're a lamb and he becomes a lamb that would be hard to believe well it's the same thing takes place when you become converted from a sinner to a Christian it changes your own opinions it changes your own will it changes everything that's in you and it brings you into another life and gives you another spirit that bears forth another record then your old life has to die and then the new one has to be born again and then you see you're no more the creature you was at all that's when you become behind the blood fortified with the word don't try to explain nothing just believe it and go on how does it work I don't know it just works something changed in me and now all I want is to serve God and please him and every time I fail I'm miserable at my failure do I fail yes I fail amen sister Bruce failed brother Branham failed amen everybody fails that's why I've said over and over I'm so glad that we had a prophet that was honest that would stand in the Pulpit amen and tell about lying to the uh lying to the to the lawyer he would talk about when he told God God you owe me an explanation he would tell us about standing in the Gap when he wanted to fulfill his selfish desire and run away from the ministry and run away from the people and God's rebuke he told us all of that and you know why he told us all of that because he didn't need you to have a good opinion of him to be saved foreign he didn't need to leave look perfect in your eyes to equal salvation he didn't need you to put him on a pedestal he could knock his own pedestal out and come crashing down because it changed nothing with him and God he could be honest because his mistakes didn't change who he was I think it's amazing amen we were so afraid to be honest about where we are and honest about our mistakes and honest about that listen that has nothing to do with who I am who I am I am by Revelation by faith amen by what God has done for me not what I've done and I made a whole load of mistakes still making them daily but praise God Amen you know the Bible says confess your faults to one another and pray for one another confess your faults to one another and pray for one another well if they know what I have fault still think this and then listen it doesn't matter what they think I mean it matters we don't want to we don't want to throw stumbling stones at people's feet we understand we have to have wisdom we can't just be Reckless but I'm not here to preserve my reputation I have no reputation and if I feel like I need to preserve my reputation I'm in the wrong mental state brother Branham didn't try to protect his reputation amen and I'm so glad that he was honest are you glad he was honest it gives me a whole lot of hope so so sister Bruce said I made a lot of mistakes brother Ben said he's not looking at that he's looking at your desire I make a lot of mistakes I'm glad he's not looking at that he's looking at my desire so now I'm not afraid of my mistakes because there's already been an advocate there's an advocate with her father there's already a blood atonement there's already something to take care of it and so fearful of that I'm not so fearful to make mistakes not so fearful somebody finding out my mistakes not so fearful because it's my reputation in the eyes of man are not what I'm concerned about my reputation my the thoughts that God has towards me that's what I'm really concerned about and I as a as a i as a person and I hope us as a bride we want to move above the carnal above all of this stuff and get up to where we have a genuine Revelation and recognize Hey listen we fail we make mistakes but God's not looking at that he's looking at the desire in my heart amen and then we don't have to be so worried about looking perfect in the eyes of everybody else we don't have to be under such pressure that nobody ever sees me make a mistake and I never do anything wrong listen don't put peacock feathers in a crow a sheep Bears wool a peacock puts out peacock feathers a born-again Believer lives lives a Christian Life and he doesn't have to worry about his mistake along the way that mistake along the way cannot offset what God's done for him and also should not change his whole life we should be bearing wool amen how do you bear wool brother Chad don't think hard you don't try hard the Sheep all it does is live and wool comes out all the peacock does is eat and live and the peacock feathers come out amen so listen what what a Christian Life is the natural byproduct of being a Christian it should come as a natural life so there shouldn't be so much pressure to look a certain way or to have a certain speech or to say a certain thing or use certain phrases and act like we know certain things and understand certain doctrines we shouldn't be under that pressure amen what we should be is free to know that God before the foundation of the world has determined who I am and by faith I believe and I connect back to what was in God's mind and now whatever I need to know he'll reveal it to me whatever whatever I I need to do he'll reveal it to me I just want to live a consecrated humble Christian Life and let wool come out not worry so much as well is that not wool is it the right color wool just live a Christian Life in the message paradox he says for instance I believe that every born-again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I believe each one of you methodists and Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had the experience had never had experience the baptism the Holy Spirit was in a formal church that did not believe in the genuine New Birth and has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone can look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle and unless that happens you cannot be a Christian unless that happens you cannot be a Christian there must be a paradox for you to become a Christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of God I can't give it to you I can't I can't do anything all I can do is invite you to seek God all I can do is invite you to surrender your life invite you to seek after him invite you to receive the Holy Ghost all I can do is give the word and invite you to receive the word and invite you Amen to die to yourself and take the word that's all I can do but I cannot give it to you God is the only one who can give it to you no minister no Ministry nothing can give it to you only God can give it to you all a minister can do is show you the way show you the path and invite you to surrender all and invite you to cry out to God invite you to ask God to fill you invite you to receive it but that's as far as we can go amen no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of God alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it over and over brother Brown talks about this experience of the new birth he's talking about a change something that changed changed and didn't change back but changed a new creature a new creation one that's heart is in line with the word and following after the word from here on out I said God that reality that was in your mind before the foundation of the world make it a reality to each of us my security is in his thinking I'm securing him at Calvary I'm secure now seated in him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and I'm secure with him in me praise God let's all stand musicians if you'd please come praise God amen are you happy are you thankful that God brought us a messenger that can give us the mystery that was in the back part of God's mind and take all the loose sins that had gotten lost through these these these these two thousand years and tie them back together so that we won't be stuck in this scare and this darkness and this misunderstanding but we would know who we really are Sons and Daughters of God by grace that we were there before the foundation of the world and if we started there we're going to wind up there if we begin there to start our journey we're going to finish our journey there and now all the things that happen in between God has already made a way to take care of those things but I came from God and I'm going back to God how do you know brother Chad because I believe it in my heart I don't have a certificate I can't can't give you a DNA test from this physical blood amen there's nothing I can do to prove to anybody else amen the only evidence I have is faith because faith is a substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen so the only evidence that I carry is my faith that he's unlocked in my heart that I believe and I know that he's changed me I know what I was and I know what my desires were and I know how incapable I was of taming this flesh but I know what he did for me and I know the change that took place in my life and now because he first loved me all I want to do is serve him in love pure love unselfish love amen God bless you thank you ever song [Music] well there's a voice calling me from victory and he whispers draw closer to me foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and what ever it takes to be more like you hear that's what I'll be willing the course one more time [Music] for whatever foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I hear you that's what I'll be willing to you well God bless you all this evening nobody enjoyed that tonight I sure enjoyed that it wasn't my good works he just came my way he predestinated me to come my way and I'm so appreciative what a solid rock we're standing on in the hour in which we're living we better not take it for granted I just wanted to give you a little update from last Sunday service it was a real honor and privilege to be able to go down to Junction City and um we went down on Saturday night and got there was about two hours and 45 minutes away and I didn't want to be late so we went down Saturday night and had some fellowship with the brother that evening for about three hours and wonderful Fellowship that evening with the brother and then went to church that morning and on the way there you know just following the directions and as we're pulling up there's a great big church I'm like wow they reserve a church or something cars everywhere we're pulling in there and there's a little garage off to the side by a little house and saw brother Wesley and that was church and it made me excited I got real happy and I said you know here's a little three-car garage kind of simple real simple the inside was some a whole bunch of chairs and a whole bunch of hungry Hearts sitting there ready for the word a little propane heater trying to knock the heat off the room and off the air and I says this is just about right God hiding himself in Simplicity revealing himself in the same way and you know it just follows the pattern there was no end that could it could be welcome in and he was pushed out of all the great big places and he found himself in a little hungry heart you know and found himself at a a well one day with a woman that was an unrighteous woman but in her heart she was Desiring to serve God we had a wonderful wonderful time you know me I'm about a one-hour preacher maybe 1 10 I guess maybe if if things are pulling right and I went two hours and got halfway through my notes on just a little thought on let there be light and taking the light and it's God's word separating light from the darkness and Genesis and then into John and that life was manifested as the light and now it's walking in the light as he is in the light and by God's grace that light came my way so I could stand there as a witness of the light and express that light the best that I could do and I was just happy and honored that God would give me the opportunity to put a little water on some seeds that have been sowed and they're really coming to life it was really fun brother Wesley showed up and brother Brock showed up and a couple surprises there so we had a nice little 30 35 something people in there and it was a wonderful wonderful time and the brother Arvin at the end he's like my only prayer is brother I don't want you to leave and I was like well I'm sorry I got a whole bunch of young people at my house I got to get back to so we had a wonderful time keep them in prayer looking forward to go back to him again and just keep watering the seeds of life and God's plan it there so just a reminder here that uh there's a wedding obviously if Edinburgh didn't know there's a wedding this Saturday uh please take all your stuff home they'd like it to be removed from the sanctuary if you've got stuff on your seats your designated seats need to
