before I ever came to visit he's been a friend of many for a long time and we've known him watched him grow up through his teenage years his young adult life as God used him as a translator and then gifted him he studied hard but God gifted him and gave him the ability to translate and he's translated much of the message into the Russian language and also summoned the Lithuanian language and then God called him the minister while he was still young and he's ministered for many years and now he's pastoring a fellowship there and that's been just a change has come recently in his life and so we're so thankful he's come brother Vitale and I have always known him brother Vitale but it was really in the last probably four or five years we've really become friends and he's a precious friend

grateful to be here this morning in this wonderful church here oh my if I start looking at the faces here I probably will forget what I was going to preach about because you feel such a long you know such a long-standing connection just like brother Chad mentioned and we bring you we bring some greetings to you from our little walk there in the Vilnius Lithuania and also from the other assemblies you know they they are the pastors that knew I would be going to visit you know they appreciate your ministry here some of them know brother Chad so they said please greet the church here from Belarus from Russia from Lithuania there's Believers there church is there saints of God the Bride of Jesus Christ so yeah we're so grateful you know for a privilege of being here especially with my family here my wife and my three daughters Neville in our Wildest Dream who would have you know such a you know such a dream to to be here and fellowship with the Saints here and and here we are you know we've it's it's our third week here across the ocean we've been to uh some other churches previous to this uh I've been to Idaho and also I've been to Edmonton with uh brother Eugene Brown the church there and uh uh now this is our final leg you know of the of the trip here and the brothers were you know gracious to me so it's it's it's just service number seven or eight you know during the during these weeks and we've enjoyed some time of uh fellowship and vacation with uh with with our uh with my family here so I really appreciate the brothers who made it possible too for us to come it is very refreshing you know it is you know the best the best sightseeing for us is the is the city of the Living God you know so so when you go through the alleys and the you know the golden streets you know you you just visit with the Saints we've been able to you know visit some of you here we just have a few short days here but uh it's been so good you know it's been so refreshing it's such a it's such a bomb and Gilead you know when you when you go and you visit the uh the streets of gold that you haven't been before I believe you know the city is is the people you know so so when you go and when you haven't touched you know we see the glory of this great City and uh you know we'll we'll bring some of those testimonies back home and to say oh the city is wonderful the city is is beautiful it's worth seeing you know so so we appreciate you all uh today and to see some good old friends here you know that's you know and now our kids have grown up you know and you you know time is flying but one thing is becoming stronger is uh is our bond with Jesus Christ our bond with the word and also our bonds with one another this is what I believe is going to be stronger with as as this glorious Rapture is coming closer so uh this morning I would just want to take a very short and you know simple uh thought I believe God is simple so it can reach the hearts you know and I just want to read a few scriptures with you that's Mark 4 33 34. and Luke 13 20-21 so if you can stand with me and uh and on the word uh we'll read from Mark 4 33 first and it says and with many such Parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it but without a parable speaking not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples praise the Lord and Luke 13 20 21 that's the main scripture and we want to focus on the Lord willing and it is one of The Parables one of the strange let's say one of the unusual Parables that Jesus told us and told his disciples Luke's 13 20. it says and again he said where unto shall I liken the kingdom of God and says it is like 11 which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened amen you can be seed it praise the Lord so this is Jesus speaking here and we understand that this was his style of his ministry you know wherever he would go he would speak in Parables he would use certain comparisons and you know the reason why he was doing this is actually mentioned here in the scriptures because he he was addressing him a particular um uh audience there his target audience was was his disciples but uh but then he was also speaking to everybody so uh now he he had to say it in a way that you know would be a sermon but then it would also be a mystery in a way because then uh his disciples would come uh separately and say what did that mean you know we we didn't really understand so he just like the scripture says in Mark he would expounded to them he would actually explain it to them and give the meanings of those things uh to his disciples and I believe we're his disciples too I mean his disciples are still here they are still on Earth because Jesus is still on Earth you know he's here his spirit is here his word is here so that that's the way in Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if he did that yesterday he would do it today and he'll keep on doing it you know so so that's his style of ministry you know in in Matthew 13 He also says he who has ears to hear here uh let him hear and the disciples came and sent to him why speakers there are unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given so uh the disciples were asking about them you know about the general public and they're saying why are you speaking to them in Parables he says because it's given unto you because I'm talking to you basically you know and and you are the ones you're the recipients you're the understanders you're the ones that this word is actually targeted at and he says it is given it has been given already right it's it's past tense I mean it's it's not that it will be given maybe it's it is predestination it is election you have a a a a a something in in heart in your heart that is able to receive that word it is given unto you to know to understand oh praise be to Jesus and he says why are you speaking in Parables and he says because it is given to you uh to know the Mysteries okay so so the meaning of the parable is a certain mystery there's something hidden in there it's something and you can't you cannot understand it unless it's given unto you and he says it is given unto you so you are sure to receive the mystery to understand the mystery to know the mysteries of what of kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given he says but it is given unto you I am I'm sure those disciples were happy you know they didn't understand but they were happy you know they were like oh praise the Lord you know it has given unto us so you know and in a certain way at a certain time this mystery will be revealed and it it is becoming clearer oh thank you Jesus so now when we when we go into uh you know the the ministry of Jesus there's you know plenty of them you probably even have counted and know how many parables in comparisons he has used in his uh in his ministry and uh you know there's many of them and many different types of them and these are all Mysteries these are this is something that is hidden in there and will be revealed to those that is given to right and I believe it's us I believe it's the Bride of Jesus Christ who will know what those Parables actually meant and brother Brandon when he goes into mistress and he says these are the if you remember the quote from seven churches it says these divinely revealed mystery truth have a purpose it's not just to Enlighten us it's not just to you know make us clever and to you know make us distinct from the others who don't you know really perceive those things it's actually they those mystery truths are amend to turn our hearts literally turn our hearts lift our faith up to the level of the Apostles to the level of the fathers praise the Lord so every time I read a parable every time you read the parable we are searching for a faith lift not for not for a facelift but for a faith lift in there something that would lift our faith up and say oh I believe it even more I Now understand the kingdom of God more and I understand the word more it is more revealed now to me than ever before praise the Lord even though these were just simple stories really simple stories and brother Branham had his parables you know the old fiddle the eagle story and you know the old Chevrolet and the engineer and you know the the man on the balcony the teacher you know and all of this these were actually The Parables of the son of man you know the modern ones the updated ones so every time we read that where our faith is lifted we understand oh I am the eaglet you know I I felt bad in this setting and now I'm I'm gonna you know fly high so praise the Lord just lifts our faith right thank you Jesus so so this is this is the meaning why he was actually in doing this the purpose was to lift our faith and to make us more believe more thank you Father so now every time you see Jesus standing there and he is you know the uh brother Brandon would say it depended on where he was you know speaking and this is where you know the type of parable would come out and he you know he was standing let's say before an audience of uh that was there in the agriculture Natural Area he would you he would mention the sower and the seed and and then he would go to the coast and speak to to them about fishing and and the net and all of these kind of things the reason was because he would understand that he is standing there and he was trying to explain to them things they've never seen before so how should he do that he would use their own concept their own understand their own uh uh language so to speak so that they would at least roughly have an idea because every time he would use the parable he would say it is like unto it's not exactly that it's not fully that you know you cannot it's a shadow it's a type it's it's a it's an example it's a metaphor it's a it's a comparison but it's not exactly that you know so so when uh when he was doing that it depended on what the audience actually was so that he and he was trying to relate that oh isn't that the way Jesus speaks to us today I mean he will always find a way to that is really close to our heart and somebody else does not understand that language but do you understand that language because you are that way if you're you know a man of nature you know you're in the woods you'll hear hear this bird chirp and you know you got you know an answer from the Lord and somebody else comes there there's a chirp and he's kind of nervous you know why is this bird chirping you know so and and he he's a you know and uh another type of man and maybe a scientific man he's just sitting there and Counting something he comes up with an eight and he says oh that's eternity I praise the Lord you know just like brother Brandon would say you know I I shot this deer there was like five streaks or you know uh something on one side and three on the other that's Grace and Perfection praise the Lord it was the God's will you know so it's like oh yeah so this is the way he he would be I wouldn't even count those things you know so but but he was that way you know so God has a language that he speaks to us and it's basically our language he drops down to our level to speak to us with the concepts that we really understand and that you know that because he needs to bring a message across so it would really be clear so who is now standing here and he you know we just read the parable on the before that he actually mentioned a parable of the mustard seed and he says and let's imagine who is actually standing there explaining those things to the people it's the word himself it's the one who is actually created the kingdom of God it's the kingdom of God in flesh standing there is the one who created the people and the one who created all those Dimensions that he's actually trying to describe to them so he's the main engineer right he's the doer he's the he's the CEO of of everything you know he's he's the Creator so he's standing there he created the people so just like he created you and he created all the worlds he created the kingdom of God oh he has a very nice and clear way to explain it to us right because he knows exactly he knows much better than anybody else what it's like and he knows much better uh than anybody else who when who would understand what because he's created you you know you you have your children and you know there's some you know you you probably maybe you they have some challenges of somebody explaining things to them and then they go to their mom and dad and mom and dad knows exactly you know what they their level of understanding is and they're like okay this is the oh okay it just rings the bell right away because they you you're close you know that's that's your child so so Jesus is standing there and he is the beginning of the creation of God you know and he is the logos and he is the one from the beginning he's seen it all when there was nothing he was there you know and he is standing now here and he's the best teacher he is the best explainer of those things Hallelujah thank you Jesus so now if we if we uh look at this this Parable that we've just read you know it's a it's an interesting one because um I couldn't understand it for years you know there's been the other Parables were clearer maybe but this this one was kind of a bit of a mystery for me so I was studying on it and and recently just touched or touched my heart and I started you know seeing certain things that I wanted to share that with you because it has been an encouragement for me I believe it can be for you too and he says and again he said where unto shall I liken the kingdom of God so if you read the context he was just sharing the Mustard Seed Parable before that and he's standing there and uh you can just imagine just draw a little drama here and you can imagine him standing there and uh he's trying to explain the kingdom of God to the people so so let's say maybe maybe that audience was uh was predominantly women sisters and uh he he's standing there and because the Bible actually says and again he said so he he was speaking and he he was trying to bring the message across and maybe he was seeing people are not catching it yet you know so he's like okay so how do how do I we're unto Chelan like in the king so what what's the other way of doing it how shall I you know what say other comparison or maybe you know we have many sisters and women here and they you know I've I've mentioned so many other Parables before like about the you know the male ones like about the solar about the fishermen and about the net and about you know the husbandmen and about this and that and there's still sister is here and he's like maybe standing there and thinking oh I wish you know I could you know find a way to explain it to them as well because you know sometimes the sisters will sit there and think okay those Brothers they they can catch things and how about me you know how about uh I don't feel like I really understand the those things so I believe it was something on that order of that order that that really motivated him to uh you know because every time it depended on the audience right it depends on on who was sitting there so he says well and again he says where under shall I liken the kingdom of God well so and then in in other words well if you if we put it in modern language how how how on Earth will I now reveal those seals to the sisters and uh because the sisters need to do to to to to to to understand it too you know and uh and maybe maybe Martha and Mary was there you know and they were asking Jesus would you maybe say something that really you know strikes our hearts because it looks like Lazarus is catching it but but you know we're you know this sister of mine is she was busy with the dishes and she didn't really catch that last time when I was sitting there at your feet and maybe I didn't really understand the sower part of it but yeah it was good but it just needs to ring a bell you know so so they were maybe maybe that was the the audience and maybe somebody similar to that and they really wanted to to grasp The Mystery of the Kingdom and the Mystery of the Kingdom for us it is the seventh seal because it's it is God it is it brings Christ to Earth right this is what brother Brian says what does it bring him for for for Kingdom he is the kingdom he brings the kingdom to the Earth right so so and in Luke 11 that's two chapters before that he was teaching them to pray and they asked them how shall we pray now you know Jesus John's disciples they know how to pray and how about you and he is teaching them to pray about a kingdom he says thy kingdom come and maybe the sisters and even the brothers they would like on what kind of a kingdom is that why should we pray about it don't we have a kingdom here you know and and things like this so they may have different questions and so he is explaining to them what kind of kingdom is actually he is preaching about praise be to Jesus so I imagined him standing there and he would say and again where unto shall I look in the Kingdom oh I got an idea the kingdom of heaven is like 11. so he might have seen Martha and Mary you know while visiting how they were dealing with the dough and you know baking something and uh and he he probably thought oh that's a good way of explaining things to to the sisters and to those that know about Bakery and uh so he says it is like 11. which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened Hallelujah I mean this is just a short verse you know just you know one basically one verse one one story one short story but it it actually explains the whole kingdom of God from a certain perspective and it's strange you know the reason why I couldn't understand it for for years is because you know 11 is mainly negative you know in the in the Bible it's a negative comparison you take the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the 11 of malice and all those you know that are mentioned in in the Bible but yet you know our our Prophet is so clear on things he says you know it it has you know compound meaning it may have both a positive and a negative you know uh meaning depending on context you know if you take different um types like you know we would say a goat you know every time you would think it's probably something really uh negative but who is this scapegoat it's Jesus Christ right and then you take a line you know he devil is like a little roaring line really aggressive but he's the line of Judah you know too so it goes both ways right thank you Jesus so this this 11 here it actually means something really positive when you when you when you look at that and so what is 11 I'm not a big expert on that but I've seen it work you know in in my wife's kitchen but uh you know it's it's it is something basically to just to give a short definition it is something that has a single cellular organisms that multiply quickly that multiply and replenish you know uh the dough but you know they this is there's a certain life inside of there there's an independent life in the leaven that can fill a certain space that can feel a certain matter over there right so so that this is you know this is the principle that Jesus is actually using and he wants us to understand that nothing will come right away and you will not be you know there uh you know fast it is a process but it is a guaranteed assured process where if it gets into there oh thank you Jesus it is working there there's a life inside over there there's a life that is not your life but it's his life inside of there so you remember brother Brian says you know the Holy Spirit when he enters into your life he's like a little button you know he's is this little size just like this little micro organism in fact in 11 you don't even see it with your eyes it's not visible you gotta have a microscope or something to see how those bacteria or whatever you call them you know uh they they are spreading but it is there Hallelujah thank you Jesus and then brother Brian says it's it's a little ball of light you know and then it goes into a little golf ball or size or something like this and it goes for you know it grows and grows inside of you just like what just like 11. in the dough oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah so let's let's just look at you know this since there's only one verse we'll look at almost at almost every word in there because it's condensed you know it's like those little toys you know our children you know buying the story they buy a little something like this and they throw it in you know in a in a bowl of water and it grows you know just you got those here too yeah okay so so now if you if you look at that you know this every word there has has a meaning and you know one of the things that uh really caught my attention is that he speaks he actually speaks about a woman here it is a woman that took and hit those three measures of uh of uh in the three measures of meal and till the whole was uh 11. so it is a woman a woman is a church so it's a type of the church and this and this church it's not that it has the leaven it doesn't know how to to work with it she knows exactly what to do with leaven and the meal isn't that what brother Birmingham told us he says the word is in the bride and he says the mind of Christ insist and to know what he wants done with that word in other words he trusts and he gives this leaven into her hands and and he says now you're the one dealing with it now you're the one working with it it's not like oh praise the Lord God the leaven God got the leaven I got the Holy Ghost I got the Revelation that's fine and now you have to work with it and now you have to mingle it now you have to mix it into a reality oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah so so when we we look at that woman we look at that church we see that she actually goes through those three stages or three actions the three verbs mentioned there she took the leaven she hid it or mixed it with the dough with the meal and she had to wait until it's all done it's all leavened so all of these things this is what we we're going through every time God sends a revelation every time God sends this life in a into us every time there's those little microorganisms coming from Heaven coming from above entering into our life this is how it will work Hallelujah it's it's a major principle of the kingdom of God how it works practically in our lives oh I love the Practical side of the seven seal you know this this is what makes me happy you know and this is what I believe it actually this was make the sisters listening to Jesus preach happy because they finally understood oh is it that simple I thought it was a gap between this and that seal you know and and those you know the vials and everything and I I know it is there but the principles are really simple it they are available by Revelation to any age thank you Jesus so so the the first thing that actually uh the woman had to do she had to take it she had to take the level she had to receive it oh this is the first thing we actually do with the Life of Christ with the revelation of Jesus Christ with something coming from the heaven coming from the kingdom of God refers have to receive it it should be our initiative it should be our desire it is our desire we want it sometimes we don't realize but we want it brother President says we are made to thirst for God we are made to thirst for that leaven we have made two thirst for the kingdom of God we're quenching The Thirst with somebody it's something else that that that's that's a problem but our real desire is for the kingdom of God thank you Jesus so you really want it and then you'd it's the principle across the Bible you gotta go and take it Ruth had to go and claim it Esther had to go and claim it John had to go and take the book oh the book is here oh that's fine yeah it's wonderful it is revealed oh yeah it is revealed now go and take it it is your desire and and no one no one's to blame you know we were standing there and not taking it right it's because it is your desire and God expects you he says draw near unto me and I'll draw near unto you make a step of Faith I'll make a step towards you God says oh it is so wonderful and he's never failed of doing this so as as as soon as you take it it's in your hands now it's your responsibility this is your leaven now this is your Revelation Hallelujah somebody preaches you know here at the pulpit the pastor preaches to somebody else uh preaches and this Revelation coming out and now you receive it this is yours now it's not his anymore this is your Revelation though this is your level this is something you got in your hands hallelujah thank you Jesus this is this is a piece of 11 there's a there's a REV there's a microorganism there's a life behind that and you know what it it works perfectly well when you know you you you would sometimes wonder you know this preacher is standing here you know or a pastor or whoever you know is ordained to or to do that and he's preaching something to you and you accept it and it works it really works there's life inside of there there's a microorganism inside of there that has a transforming power Hallelujah why is because because in fact the mechanics of this is that this this Minister there he actually tested the leaven in his life this is where most of the time it works on other people and then he preaches and says it's good it works there's life in there I can prove it it's working just like a Rahab remember when she when she came when she received the spies why did the token work because it first worked for her how can we apply the token to our families for our children for our loved ones if only if it works for us first if the leaven is there and she she knew they spared her life she was dead sure she they will spare her and her dad and her mom and her brother and the sister so she was like come on guys it's coming in it works it works I'm not sure about that well I got a testimony about it praise the Lord so it's there's a life inside of there there's a leaven inside of there inside of that token that really works for you and if it works for you program says if you haven't have faith for yourself if you have enough level for your 11 for yourself if you have enough Revelation for yourself use the same substance thank you Jesus it's the same stuff the same material it's just like water you can water plants with it you can drink it you can you know wash your windshield whatever with it it's the same substance you can use it multi-progress that's faith thank you Jesus so same thing goes with 11. you take it and you know it really works Hallelujah you receive it it is actually your effort of Faith now this is the first step and the woman is really happy oh man I've got some Bakery in my mind I got something you know that I'll really fix this will be good this will be a really nice delicious you know so so she now she has those those those those two components she has the level and and she also has the meal and the meal if you look it up the word actually means wheat flour so that's wheat it used to be corn you know there used to be a grain but now now it's it's it's ground into into a flower so she had to to mix those two components together and to change their form oh it's it's really wonderful we'll we'll get into that for you in a while Lord willing so the second thing she actually has to do is is she actually has to work with it she actually has to mix it you your sisters would know you know and those brothers who know more about baking I don't know you know basically anything about it but you know because I don't have to you know I have a Master Chef you know at home so you know and and now you you but but basically you don't do it like this you you it's not that you know you uh you take some uh you know it takes some dough and whatever you have here okay and then uh and then then you add some leaven to it right you just you don't like let it just stick like this right it's just like oh okay I've I've done my part you know I've I've edited to just though it's it's there I can go now no what do we actually actually have to do is you actually have to mix this thing into into though she has to mix it she has a meal it right it takes some work so sometimes it's a little piece like this but sometimes it's a bigger one and you need some help sometimes you look tired oh man I'm tired mixing it you know maybe you can help me oh sure it can help you you know so so it takes some work and uh you know the word you know uh hide because it says she took the leaven and she hid it in the three measures it actually means to mix it but but I like I like the word to hide you know too because it refers to the Mysteries it refers to being inside of there somehow you know and there's you know just like brother Brian would preach hidden life in Christ how it's there is because it's mixed into you oh thank you it is you know it is a mystery between you and God and and it takes different types of mixing no if you take the woman as a church it's sometimes hard work to take the revelation and he got the church which is the dough which is the meal right and you have someone in the church who is active doing and has the word and knows what to do with the word right and what he he actually has to do they have a lot of they have a lot of work mixing that 11 that Revelation into the people right into the worship area into the into the Sunday School into the Deacons into the mothers into the fathers into the young people there's a lot of work praise the Lord and you can see that one part of this dough is already leavened whereas the other is not and there's no reason to say well this is lemon this is not I mean yeah see no it just takes more work it just takes more effort it just takes more time and sometimes you know the Lord uses the circumstances of Wildlife and he he just throws us into a dough mixer you know and and there we go Lord why are you doing this well there's some lemon you you haven't absorbed yet so you know and and sometimes as areas in our life you know that has not been leavened yet do you have those areas or am I the only one here standing that you know I'm not fully leavened yet and I'm I'm going into there but there's still areas which you know they you feel like this should be more victory in there there should be more life and there should be more Revelation there should be more understanding sometimes you won't like to do it but but you it's not revealed unto you so far so what do what do you do you got you have to mix it into your life more you have to have more of that and wait until it leavens the whole lump oh thank you Jesus so so what what what this woman actually does this church actually does you she mixes it with the dough oh so it's hidden in there there's a mystery inside and and and and when she mixes it and and she she realizes it's not the same substance anymore this leaven is is mixed into it now there's something inside of there and the leaven doesn't do anything it doesn't really shout it doesn't really scream uh it doesn't produce any any sound probably but what what it actually is it is a silence it is a process of Silence where something really mixes into a different form it is it is a a quickening process it is a transformation process so it's a mystery inside of you doesn't that remind you of Revelation 8 1 where it says the land when the lamb took the book and uh he he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for half an hour oh praise be to Jesus thank you there's a mystery going on the mystery is being revealed in where in your life in your dough in your practical life oh we've just been a you know the camp was uh brother Eugene and there was a minister from uh Calgary and he had a little session and uh you know we just looked at this a little verse where the Bible says that women shall learn in silence you you know the verse right and immediately while we were just you know speaking about that you know because because this leaven is so good you know it's just it just penetrates into every every little scripture you know every little principle in the Bible so it's almost like you're speaking about conduct here you know not deserve Authority and you know learning in silence but it is the seventh seal in there as well you know a woman that is learning in silence is the bride oh praise be to Jesus Revelation 1 8 1 says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven so if you're standing there in the seventh seal this Christ in reality is and the word itself Jesus Christ who is The Great I Am who is Jesus Christ the yesterday today and forever he is being revealed to you you start learning in silence you're not teaching him he's teaching you this is how brother brano opened the opened the series on the seals and says you know God in Simplicity he reads this verse from Matthew and he says I thank you Father that you have not revealed this to the wise of prudent but you have revealed that unto whom unto babes and he would always add this phrase such as would learn and we can add another phrase here from context in silence the babes that should learn such as would learn in silence because they have nothing to say they have lots to learn that's it this is how job received the Revelation he talked he was talking he was preaching he was explaining he was condemning he was accusing he was justifying he was doing this and and when the seven sealed himself stood right in front of him in all kinds of questions types this 44 questions posed and he's standing there and he's old just like the Angels were owed in the half an hour there silence and he's learning and what did he learn it says I got nothing to say I have lots to learn oh thank you this is this is how we learn this is how we learn because when this word is revealed to us we're owed by this and we it's not that no I don't agree with this you know I gotta think about that I I have no explanation for this but with real encounter with the seventh seal this is where you're old with it so much you're you're ready to shut up and say Lord I'm learning Lord I'll learn in silence now I'm the woman who's in in the verse actually says a woman should learn in Silence with all subjection it's not that I'll Stand and I'll listen through there here I'll be silent for a while but it's not that I agree with it no it says in Silence with all subjection that is anything but the truth this is something that is being revealed and often to me oh this is there's lots to learn can you repeat that again I haven't put that on my nose you know I should put that on the tables of my heart yes thank you Jesus Hallelujah oh thank you Father because it wasn't just in the description falls on it says it was it wasn't Adam who is this it was the evil it was us who were deceived because I swear the wrong Revelation he was asked who had the wrong understanding but he has the right understanding Christ himself so he went he also opens up to you in a simple way as in as this little Parable here say Lord is it that simple well then then I want to learn then I want to learn oh because Christ is it is the second seal is is a person it is Christ himself it's somebody talking somebody explaining somebody loving you somebody have an affection with you oh Jesus thank you Hallelujah oh thank you Father so so are you sitting in church and you you know you've maybe have been there for Wednesday night service and you hear the word and you hear how they like Broadband says this Revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes and then he says and then when we receive it we are edified and purified by the spirit and made ready for his glare glorious appearing well this is what happening every time we believe every time we receive a revelation from God oh thank you Father oh yes thank you Jesus so let's go into the meal part here you know she she takes the lemon she knows it works it has the right microorganism inside of there so she's really willing and exciting oh well I love this church I love those people and I really want them to grasp this so so this this church this this woman she she actually takes this leaven and she's like anticipating oh now when they grasp this Revelation oh it will work oh it will be so good you know so the meal is actually made of grain but the the parable doesn't say she had to mix the leaven with the grain right so the grain the wheat had to undergo a certain process before 11 was actually added right and and the process is not nice because before that you would have different sizes of the grains right oh you have a lot of stuff here to use as as visual aids you know so so so you would have a grain this size and then you would have a grain this size and you would have a grain this size and we have a tall grain like this you know and before before they go into the process of grinding they're all different sizes right sorry this may be for the kids you know you never know so it depends on what the audience is pulling you know so but but I mean just different we we come up you know as as as bright material as bright raw material we come in different sizes right we come come in you know and and you know sometimes uh you know these guys are kind of the same but when this guy shows up it's like oh I'm a real grain you know oh so so they're all you know coming into the grinding machine but but they they're talking in between themselves and they're saying you know you know this this guy says you know I'm kind of one of the tallest and biggest and citizens of this one that says and I've always lived a clean life you know you know and this and this and this guy says well I'm kind of the the highest and the tallest here and I'm kind of you know really stylish and nice here but how about this guy and this guy doesn't even open his mouth you know he's like is is looking up to all of them is like am I will I ever make it but this guy here you know he lifts his voice and he says you all guys you don't know what you're talking about you know because you know I'm so big and tall nobody can beat me well nobody except the grinding machine oh my goodness so then then the Lord takes all of them Embraces because he actually loves all of them so he loves all of them and he's like oh you you look nice now but after you come out from there you look even nicer so so he opens up you know the the machine oh you got the machine here right yeah so he opens you know the the uh the the grinding machine and he throws all of this into here and there's a lot of work there's a lot of Trials you know brother Brown says but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be ground Twisted squeezed and to get what it was out there was too much Brenham in there had to be squeezed out before God could take himself known so that means before you receive a revelation before crisis is ready to to be added as leaven you should be meal by then you should be grounded by then oh because without humility you you're not receiving revelation Hallelujah so all of these guys go into the grinding machine and when they get out there's no big ones there's no tall ones there's no transparent ones there's no small ones they are all the same size and by then they are already mixed together [Laughter] I was like you know did you did you also have to go through that oh yeah did your kids do that oh yeah did you pray for so many nights and days oh yeah do they have a problem with your job oh yeah do they have a health issue oh yeah all of these we all have to go through that in the grinding machine in the milling machine and when we come out we're not big there's no big and important Brothers anymore amen there's no small ones that we would look down on thank you Jesus amen hallelujah oh praise the Lord brother Bram actually ties it to to Christ and he says the meal offering and the true and false Vines and he says the middle offering any teacher knows that the meal offering waiver offering heave offering all the offerings pertain to Jesus and the little meal offering must be ground with birds and that cuts every little speck the same every little grain of corn must be cut the same and they had a handful of it and that means Jesus Christ the meal offering the same yesterday today and forever which is the seventh seal which is Christ reveal which is the real Christ so it takes the word you have to understand that every word is the same every word is Cuts this the promise of the healing is the same of the the same promise of the Redemption same size Redemption has healing in it healing has redemption in it right so it just breaks the word into those little chunks where you can see is Jesus Christ the same size yeah this is what brother Brown says here right in the meal offering oh thank you Jesus so as long as you see Christ the same yesterday today and forever you believe him you're the meal you're the dog Hallelujah oh thank you Father so now she has to do some work we have to do some work we gotta mix it inside of our lives right that's why that's why we you know do devotions that's why we pray that's why we have a family altar it is sometimes difficult sometimes you you come you're all you know tired you're dead tired and you're like you know sit down on your sofa and you're kind of oversleep all day you know evening devotions oh sorry guys but but it takes some effort sometimes to pull yourself up from the sofa set yourself down with the kids and the Bible or the message or whatever you you know praying with them about and things it takes some effort you gotta mix it I'm gonna mix it into your family the more you mix it the better it becomes Hallelujah so so then the third stage oh this third stage you thought those two stages were were difficult no taking it receiving it just like Ruth making a decision taking it is fine mixing it is fine but then waiting for it oh that looks like the hardest I think to me especially you know because you you want it immediately you want the effect right there you know did you receive the revelations yes does it work no then you didn't receive the revelation no sometimes it takes time for this yeast for this level to kind of spread in your life spread from your heart into your brain into your body into your family it takes time until the whole thing is leavens so the purpose is to let this microorganism inside of you and then spread it around oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus amen the good part of the living is it is contagious in both the negative and the positive sense you know if you take the 11 from the negative side you know just they they you talk about insincerity talk about you know those things you know that 11 represents the leaven of the Pharisees the you know the doctrine of the Pharisees it is contagious and Jesus warned he says don't do it don't touch it keep away from it because it'll spread like fire you you get a little bit of of that inside of you you'll just you won't even notice how it gets right into into your dough but let's look at it from the positive side [Laughter] it's the Life of Christ that wants to penetrate into every single area of your life not only into the two rooms where the Brahm says into the third room into all the areas of life that's why she will be him brother bam says she will become the word she is not the word are you the word now potentially you are but let's look at your circumstances that your flesh and things like this oh man there's a lot you know unleavened Parts just like me do you believe that well if you believe that then you you do understand there's some more leaven has to come into there right thank you Jesus Hallelujah so she is becoming the word she is becoming Jesus Christ all her areas of her life are gradually coming into it oh it's a wonderful process thank you Jesus Hallelujah oh wow so when we when we look at this this uh kingdom of God you know it actually is Jesus is not talking about Kingdom of man he's talking about the kingdom of God that's the kingdom of heaven right so it's a something coming from Heaven this little piece this little leaven coming from heaven and what it actually wants it wants to materialize here on Earth it wants to find a body that will subject itself to it and live in it Hallelujah and that's the main principle that Jesus was actually teaching right receive that into your heart mix it with your life and wait until it actually leavens the whole lump Hallelujah Hallelujah and then there's three measures of meal I love this you know I was just thinking of that oh there's three is perfection right so if you take if you take the dough if you take the meal you cannot add to it and you cannot take away from it because if the Mila is is is the grains the wheat is the children of the Kingdom then there's a set number of them right just like Revelation the end of the book of Revelation you cannot add to the book and you cannot take away from the book who's the book it's the people who is the meal it's the people you cannot add to it you cannot take away that's three perfection there's a perfect number Hallelujah all just tells me the story that the bride the full bride will actually come to perfection will be fully leavened Hallelujah everybody who's on the books uh Lamb's Book of Life will be leavened thank you Jesus Hallelujah well if we go into some other practical areas you know we we will we can definitely see that uh mixing this 11 into our life takes a lot of diligence you know because uh Paul I'm sorry Peter actually says you you know the man that goes into the Rapture he says is is the statue of the perfect man right the one that has those virtues the one that that lives with the nature of Christ inside but then Peter says you have to add all diligence right giving all diligence add your to your faith virtue so this is a this is a process of mixing right because Faith actually drives all the other vergers you do all of those things by faith right Patience by faith knowledge not by intellectual by faith right virtue not because they're good men because by faith because by Revelation so you're adding you adding you're actually taking this this uh this leaven of faith and and Revelation and adding it into your life and mixing it into it because I've always wondered why Peter is saying giving all diligence being really tick make an effort not a flashlight effort but an effort of Faith a step of faith an Act of Faith thank you Jesus Hallelujah you will say oh but Brahm said you know you don't make any effort you're a sheep you know and you know all those virtues grow in it right didn't he say that he says don't don't put those you know feathers into the bird into the black bird it'll grow it is natural that's fine and then you you can also say just like me but I'm a sheep it's just natural for me to grow virgins it is but you have don't you have to make some effort oh no I'll just sit there and and wait until the virtues grow no there's one definite effort that you have to do is eat is feed because if you just take a sheep you know and say oh you got this automatic inside of you this this is gonna grow inside of you wonderful congratulations and you leave the Sheep you know somewhere closed and locked and no food no water no nothing you come out there'll be some some you know some wool on on her you know but she might be dead by then you know so you know it takes some diligence it takes some effort you're feeding on the body word of the son of man you're eating on the revelation of Jesus Christ you're eating you're feeding on the word then it grows you're mixing this word with your life then it grows thank you Jesus hallelujah oh you know when you read it there's a wonderful place here in the uh in second Peter 1 it actually says according to his divine power given to us all things that pertain to life godliness for the knowledge of him that has called us before he mentions all the virtues he says he has called us to glory and virtue oh that makes us you know that produces a smile on my face because if God calls you to something oh that's that's an assurance if you're not called to this you will never produce it but if you called to that it means God knows you have those virtues inside of you you will be able to make it you will be able to grow them you will be able to add Faith to Virtue to knowledge to all those Hallelujah and he says you are he has called us to glory and virtue he has called us to a glorious condition it called us to a glorious body Hallelujah and he has called us through the virtues of Jesus Christ to be reflected in us to be to be manifestedness and then he goes on into all the and he says in giving all diligence head to your faith virtue virgin knowledge Temperance patience and all those and and then he goes on to say and he says and uh wherefore uh their other brothers give diligence to make your calling an election sure I've never tied those two callings it's the same the fact that God called you to the virtues God called you to the life of Jesus Christ inside of you is your calling is your general calling because sometimes we think it's it's only the specific calling you you're called to be a preacher you're called to be a minister you're called to be a song leader called to be a singer you're called to be a something this is a specific role this is just a span of time this is maybe just five years of your life right but what are you actually called to you are actually in general for the whole of your Christian Life you're called unto the glory and the virtues Hallelujah this is your calling and you got to make it sure Hallelujah that you're elected and you're also called to produce the life of Jesus Christ here here on Earth the literal life the hidden life oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah and then he goes on to say and if you give diligence and make your calling election sure he says if you do these things you shall never fail because you have faith I am called to to produce that do you have patience well ask me I don't have any patience I didn't have patience two generations ago you know talk about now my father or my grandfather they didn't have patience you know I think inherited impatience so my you know my my my physical reaction to things will be oh no I'll never make it you know be therefore perfect just like your father oh no never but if you understand you are called to produce that you are called by Jesus Christ to show that in your life oh then it brings peace and rest and then if you said that well he never lies Hallelujah I can be sure about it and I can make my calling sure too Hallelujah make sure I cast away all the doubts I I cast away all the physical things that I can see in my life I put them away and I said no I am a Son of God and I am called to those things Hallelujah oh thank you Father because you know when they it's it's a process when this leaven gets inside of you it actually it actually produces you know sometimes your sisters would probably notice how the yeast you know it produces the bubbles you know inside of there you know and and it just goes you know the dough just grows and grows and grows and grows just like you know uh David says and my cup overfloweth right because when you when you're not careful and you you always you know leave it for too long you come and it's all over the table you know right so it there's there's some micro this fermentation going in there this this those those bubbles coming up there's a power inside of there so it's just like you know brother Brandon he you know he takes this um uh message impersonation of Christianity and he uh he he he expresses you know this he shows this uh Parable or shows the example of of the wine in in the new bottles in the old bottles and in the new bottles and I love the way he he does that and he says he says when you do he says speaks about those bottles and it's the same principle you I I think you understand right adding 11 to the dough is the same as adding wine into the new bottles right because they have to stretch they have to have life inside of them right and this fermentation going here fermentation going there so it's the same principle so if we go into here and he says it's just like preaching to the Baptist of the Holy Ghost and the real genuine power of the Resurrection it's trying to place that people trying to place that before the people when you do what happens if you put it in the new wines got life the new wine is firm is still fermenting oh I hope you see it and he says the new life is for many the new life is still fermenting it's in a new flexible bottle where the oil of the enemy or animal is still in the skin the oil of the whole yearly goes when it's in your life it makes you stretch it says when the new wine goes to pushing out he says the skin will stretch the dough will stretch Hallelujah this is where you're getting out of your comfort zone this is where you living behind certain things and you grow bigger in Christ Hallelujah and then he says and otherwise when the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the new skin will say Amen stretch right and he says I'm the life of God working in you and the new skin will say Amen stretch out what is an amen taking it ready to mix it it says now Christ doesn't anoint ministers to preach the gospel just to have it returned back to him void but he expects you to receive the word to receive the leaven inside of you take the woman took the level and in receiving the word be ready take it take sheepskin that's flexible to the word of God this is exactly what's happening to us every time everything that doesn't stretch we want to we want to exchange it with by something that is really flexible change my heart O Lord to you know turn my hearts you know that the very purpose why God actually sent Elijah to this earth was not to you know make people smarter what was not to bring another Doctrine was not to you know say oh you all the denominations are wrong it was actually to turn the hearts it's a hard matter it's a sensitive stuff you know it's something you know that God actually sent Elijah and Elijah was very good at it he was excellent this was the spirit or that when God used it once you know God is a great chemist you know so he you know he would take you know uh the children of Israel once and he said they they are harder you know is away from me really far away so what do that do I do what what kind of ingredients should I use maybe I should use Moses Moses doesn't work as fine you know maybe oh I got Elijah here I got the spirit of Elijah which we know is Christ with certain attributes right so he says well I'll just add this you know and and see what what goes on and sure enough the whole Israel by a Ministry of one man turns their heart to God and this and this Minister even laughs at everybody and he says oh you don't believe I'll do it well just pour water make it even worse make it even more impossible because I know that I know that I that I know it will come and God will really use me because I have my calling and election sure thank you Jesus so he turned the heart Elijah turned the hearts John the Baptist was very good at turning the hearts how about William Brown he will definitely do it because there's number five going on you know you'll not fail because God has a plan for number five you know to the Jews he will definitely his message and the faith that he brought back will definitely turn your hearts turn my heart back Hallelujah so this is the purpose of of the message why is the Elijah here it's actually to change your heart actually to turn your heart Hallelujah whatever the heart is oh thank you Jesus and then he goes on to say yes and then you everything in the Bible says you'll say Amen but brother says but it must come from the Bible but Brandon is honest not not everything that comes out in this bridge is the Bible right so it has to be the Bible and if it is the Bible then you receive it oh thank you Jesus for for for for this fact because for the new wine only ferments wine it only verifies the elements that in there so brother actually says there's elements in there there's the microorganisms in there and he says the yeast only presses and he says uh the yeast only presses forth the bulb of the alcohol which makes it a bursting profession as the years burst its little bubble to make it more perfect the dough becomes more perfect do we want to become more perfect are we reaching for Perfection didn't Paul say let's run to Perfection then Jesus say let's be perfect just like uh he's perfect didn't Paul say where it should be the statue of the perfect man how do you reach that get the yeast inside of you it'll produce bubbles bubbles is gases which is a life it's a spirit inside of you working it's a type Hallelujah and brother William says why does the little bubble burst why does it do things in your life burst there was an explosion here this burst here this crashed here why because there was a spirit inside of you producing the bubble so that it will blow out and Birdman says make you more perfect [Laughter] and he says to give you a better taste and he says to give it the better substantial holding you are becoming stronger through the yeast process and to make it more stronger and make it so that it cannot sour oh thank you Jesus oh thank you Father oh I like this you know especially this like a last part of this sentence because it it makes it so it cannot sour you know uh you know I I'm a kind of man you know you you're probably different but everything is written on my face you know so so if I'm sour the say the face is sour you know it's like everybody knows like the family knows the church knows you know if it's you know this kind of thing oh man you better don't don't talk to him you know but but why do we need 11 why do we need fermentation why do we need you know this those bubbles of yeast inside of us because with time the wine becomes stronger it's not as sour right thank you Jesus Hallelujah and brother Brian says it actually shows from the church all the worldly elements like that and preserves the church revelation shows worldly elements out of the church and preserves the church thank you Jesus Hallelujah oh I want that wine I want that that level thank you Jesus Hallelujah it actually has to come to a Perfection of of three you know it has to bring your whole lump your whole life into subjection of Jesus Christ this woman is learning in Silence with all subjection thank you Father so we're so hell we're so so thankful that when the world is really revealed it's Progressive right because now we can understand that it will reach the more the word is revealed it will reach more areas of Our Lives you know there's more and more challenges in our life we live in the darkest age we don't know what what's happening next we don't you know we've just had a this uh uh you know the lockdown we had the you know all the stuff going on we don't know what's going on next right but as long we as we have the word revealed to us there's a guarantee we can face it and we can actually meet the challenge Hallelujah that's why we need the revealed word that's why you need we need the word that is bubbling we need something that really works we need microorganisms inside of there so sometimes we wonder oh how will the Lord deal with this part of life of mine it's so strange it's so Twisted you know it's so it's so strange and it's so misunderstood it's so hard you know it doesn't matter just makes it mix it with revelation of the word I don't have a revelation on that well ask God for revelation gee you know brother Brahm says you you have to ask for Revelation more than for the you know real bread because Jesus said God will take care of the bread but God wants you to receive Revelation to ask for it too yes Hallelujah so every time we do that we have a guarantee we have an assurance it will penetrate into those fears of life if we allow it to come in there oh thank you Father you know what brother Brandon when he speaks about the wine I love this quote and I'll probably be closing soon but he says uh this is 19. 54 you know as as early as that and he actually says he speaks about the wine and he says he just he went and performed American turned water into wine Hallelujah water into wine it had to be water first and then wine so you first have to have the word inside of you to make sure it is inside of you and then it can be turned into wine right because if it's empty you you cannot make anything out of it right but if the word is inside of you then Jesus can come and turn it into wine and he says and turn the water into wine how it like to beat and that just for a minute to show that he will do it in the resurrection how it eventually would have been wine it would have been wine all right and it went up through the vine into the grape out to the vet soured fermented come on out and was wine but he just bypassed every bit of that and made it from Water to Wine see and brother Brian says that's the way he will do in the resurrection the resurrection or the Rapture right and he says I won't have to live to be a 22 or 23 years old at my best again my be an old man shaking broke down like that he will just change it Hallelujah so so this is where the whole lump is actually fermented this is where the whole lump is actually leavened it actually will change your body you'll say what do you mean it's very simple the revelations you're receiving now the revelations you're receiving all these years the whatever God reveals to you in a simple way the same revelation will actually change your body Hallelujah this is the same caliber of Revelations just another revelation of the same thing it'll just level up to it Hallelujah this will be the last piece of the lump of the hole that will have to be leavened his buddy here Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus this 11 is going to ferment your whole being the same land that changes your soul now is the same one that will change your body same no no no not a different one it's the same one and a greater measure in a stronger way but it's the same thing is it the same 11 same level same fermentation same fermentation Hallelujah it says the same thing that changes your soul the same will change your body Hallelujah so that means you that will leaven the whole lump oh how precious the living becomes then right oh thank you Jesus I love it I love that kind of lemon same simple revelation Hallelujah well I hope it was it was useful for for the Sisters I hope it was useful for the children I hope it was useful for those who understand a little bit about Baker like me you know not really much but but it's as simple as that thank you Jesus Hallelujah and you would say is that simple oh yeah it's it's that simple it's for the babes to learn and that makes you really happy and then that just really makes you assured that you're called to it if that 11 gets into your life oh it will produce results the more you mix it inside of you the more it leavens your whole family your whole heart there whatever it takes sometimes it takes hardships sometimes it takes separation sometimes it has trials that takes illness whatever God uses all kinds of different pressures because when you mix it it's a pressure right so this this box can be nice you know and but if I if I mix it sorry and my intention is good I mean I want to mix that into here then it comes out all right but it's good it's even better than it was doesn't look like you know physical eyes yeah let's add more pressure sorry Deacons oh man why do I always have to break the rules brother rap crook invited me you know for a little tour with my kids through the Christian School which is really unique you know and here's my you know good friend so I I took this thing and started writing on the board like things like brother rap is the best you know and you know how can you run the school without brother rapping you know and he's like rule number one don't write on the on the boards but you could see he was happy for what I was writing so when you put more pressure you put more illness you put more separation more discouragement foreign yeah exactly this this is what this thing says amen this is amen I want more of that leaven inside of me and now I understand the pressures oh it just makes us more perfect just makes it bent out of shape but perfect this is this is more perfect than it was oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah we love it we love the Lord you know because it's it's not us doing it you know it's him doing it yeah why does he mention pressure about the third pool right why is pressure connected to to the expression of the third pool in the bride because only in that kind of shape you'll cry out Hallelujah thank you Father oh man I ruined it oh thank you Father so this is what happens when you have more of the seventh seal in your life unbelievable it's almost you know it's almost like you you want it to become better look nicer yeah but it doesn't it's just more submissive it just becomes more humble more believing Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus I think we'll just finish here I think we brought the message across and by God's grace we just want to say Lord change me Lord mix it within me Lord I'll wait and see what it transforms me into oh praise the Lord some parts of the body you know some parts of the church in some parts of the Bride of Jesus Christ you know they they receive things earlier and some we have to wait and some have to wait for us and it takes patience but we know it'll get there and you cannot add it it is concerned you know he was speaking to the disciples it is the bread of Christ it's a set number of people it's three it's Perfection you cannot add to it you cannot take away those people will make sure they'll all level thank you Jesus let us maybe stand and just say a few words to John Lord Jesus we thank you so much for this morning when we can just look into your word and and admire the way you put things into such a simple perspective Lord Jesus it's you've been standing there in front of simple people most of them couldn't probably write couldn't probably sign their name just like brother Brahm says but they could catch the revelation and we want to be those people Lord Hallelujah we believe you father Lord and we just want to be in your hands whatever you want to mix it into it whatever Revelation is in the word we want to receive it Lord Jesus you have come with the prophet of the hour to reveal the fullness of the word the fullness of the leaven the fullness of the power of the leaven inside of the revelation and this is what we want to receive Lord Jesus this is what we walked onto you to mix into our hearts Lord Jesus whatever it takes sometimes it takes trouble Lord Jesus sometimes it takes pressure oh father but at the end of the day we come out much better Lord Jesus thank you Father change our hearts Lord and we we just want to commit ourselves into your hands and just sing unto you this little song change my heart oh Lord make it ever true because you are the Potter you you're dealing with the clay you know how to mix it

understand but it takes a lifetime to absorb amen it's it's simple and expression but it's deep in the manifestation in our lives and it makes us as a people so thankful for the things that God has done to us to mold this Revelation and mix it into our lives things that make other people bitter you know make people sour and make people bitter are actually bringing us into the confirmation of his image we can look back on our lives when other people look back and they're bitter about their childhood and bitter about this wrong that was done and and hateful over this we can look back and say God I'm so thankful that you broke me and you molded me and you changed Me Lord the things that wouldn't would make me bitter with Revelation with understanding they make me grateful amen so I'm so grateful for the molding process of God so thankful for the Revelation that he mixes into our lives and I pray that he helps us to be patient as we wait for it to take its effect in our lives I mean I don't know about you but I was edified I was encouraged I was challenged all with the same message I said God make this reality in my life I see it I want to see it more I've seen it in the past I know this is true because it's worked in my life but I wanted to finish the process and to bring me all the way to the body change men are we willing Amen to stay on his kneading table are we willing to wait while the leaven has effect thank you God thank God for this message amen we thank God for brother Vitali and we pray that God will strengthen you brother and use you for his glory and bless you and your family it's been wonderful to have you here and thank you for sharing with the Lord laid on your heart with us blessed us I'd like to have a word of prayer together and just thank God for

boss will be still on the mission field with brother Randy to pray for them that the God will watch over them and bring them back safely home I know Brother Kyle flew with a head cold and a negative effect on him I spoke to him yesterday but I believe the Lord is touching him and will use him amen and then he'll come back with a testimony bow our heads together and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus God because we can see the reality of what was preached God it was more than a good sermon it was life it was a reality in our lives and God you used our brother to put in perspective Lord this Parable this process well we're so thankful for it Lord I pray that you'd help us Lord surrender in a greater way that we might be the woman who will learn in silence Lord not adding our own thinking not adding our own or making suggestions but just silently receiving from you the revelation the true word the understanding and Lord may we be in subjection to what we hear Lord as we yield ourselves to this Revelation and lay ourselves down and allow you to work the molding process the mixing in our lives mix this Revelation into every part of our life Lord we pray but our desire is that this Revelation would affect the whole lump all of our lives every area of our life or may you have full effect Lord I pray to you give us patience as we wait Lord for everything you've allowed in our lives to take full effect for all the Revelation that you're mixing in and every trial and all the process may it all come to a full effect in our lives and bring us into perfection we love you Lord we could have never done this on our own we could have never Lord we could have never changed ourselves we could have never grown we could have never come to Perfection we couldn't do anything without you and now we're thankful Lord for your process Lord we pray that you'd bless our brother Vitality strengthen him and use him Lord as you've called him Lord into another phase in his ministry Lord I pray you'd bless him in that bless his wife and his children strengthen them may they go home Lord refreshed and their Spirit strengthen Lord and their soul may they go

appreciate the variety I appreciate that God will choose different gifts with different temperaments and different styles and when brother was getting everything out from behind the desk and putting it out there's things he's touched that I've never touched [Music] it's not my temperament I believe if it's in that spot it should stay there nobody should touch it it's against the rules so when he got it all out and lined it up I'm thinking I could never do that praise God I wish I was more like that but now I see everything out and it's killing me I want to put it away so bad I'm going to have to walk away from the pulpit I'm gonna have to resist everything in my nature not to put everything back in its proper appropriate place but I'm going to overcome the Flesh and I'm going to walk away
