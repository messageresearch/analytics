========================================

it's a wonderful and bountiful supply one more time i'm drinking at the springs of living water happy now am i my soul this satisfied and i've got a river of life that's flowing [Applause] i've got a river of life and make me well i've got a river of life flowing out from it opens prison doors says the captives free yes i've got a river of life [Applause] [Applause] within my souls and make me whole spring up a well and life god's mercy i should [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i should my life just your voices [Music] god's mercy i should have fallen in my soul [Music] one more time [Music] mercedes i should have fallen in my soul cast down mercy hallelujah praise the lord aren't you glad mercy rewrote our life and while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to colossians chapter one and we'll get started right into the word i say god bless you this morning it's good to see you it's good to be here together amen i appreciate every opportunity we have to gather together to worship his name as brothers and sisters now we're going to look at colossians chapter 1 to get started very familiar passage of scripture but it's just one of those things you just can't get away from and it keeps revolving around and around in our hearts again and again and god is continually unveiling himself to us in colossians 1 verse 26 it says even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory i think we could preach on this every service from now until our life is done on this earth and not probably have touched the bottom of it yet because this is the great mystery this is the mystery and god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory this is the mystery this is uh the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now it's made known to his sin it's the the riches of the glory of this mystery and then when you say it it's like so simple christ knew the hope of glory that's it oh that's it friends that's it all that and more amen it's it's more than i think we've ever realized but i think god wants us to realize and he keeps unfolding it to us so that we can see who he is and who we are in him man let's bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we ask that you would just minister to us lord god that you would just watch over your word or that you would just forgive us for all the faults and failures in life lord and all those things lord that we should have done better but we lay them now at your feet and ask that you'd wash us by the water of the word that you'd move us into that place lord by the sea that you've put in us by the faith you've given us to accept your word would you move us into that place of manifestation you've called us to lord that you might be glorified in us that lord we might finish lord on this earth your purpose that you purposed for us to do while we might yield to you in a greater way that you might have greater preeminence than ever before we ask all you would speak your words into our hearts and lord that you would change us by that word into that image you had of us before the foundation of the world in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated i'd like to preach if i can take for a title this morning the necessity of the bride the necessity of the bride it's along the lines of what we've been talking about and we'll just see how the lord opens things up for us um as we go along and hopefully connects some things together for us brother graham said in the message the thinking man's filter said notice the word cannot deny itself that's that's fundamental but it's basic but fundamental the word cannot deny itself so if you're the word you cannot deny the word the word cannot deny itself then it is satisfied or it's the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your shoulder was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost and these are the things that we've been talking about amen that by predestination we are secure because we're actually a part of god and from before the foundation of the world and god is not going to lose himself and the seed shall not be heir with the shock in 1965 brother brahm said that's why the rapture the bride the wise virgin that called out the four ordained the elected while you businessmen wouldn't run your office like some people try to think that god runs this program haphazard god knew before the foundation of the world who would be saved and who would not be saved by predestination by four knowledge he saw every member put every name on the lamb's book of life before the church ever began jesus come to seek and to save that which was on the book he bought the book of redemption it was lost and he redeemed us and all names was on that book was redeemed when he redeemed us amen so we find out now that that our life has not been by chance and then our existence here isn't by chance it wasn't the uh fleshly desire the lust of a man and a woman and the desire of a man and a woman to have a child it was the will of god that brought us on this earth and god knew the end from the beginning and god is not learning anything as time goes on but god and god is also not adjusting amen his plan to our plan he's not adjusting his plan to satan's moves amen god already knew what would be and he's working everything according to his plan these are things that we have to remind ourselves all the time because in human flesh in our human mind we get rattled when things don't work out the way we expected them to work and things don't happen the way we planned for them or thought that they would happen and we begin to have to readjust our plans and rethink through some things and realign our thinking but we realize god doesn't have to do that god is not realigning his thinking he's not adjusting he's not waiting for satan to do something and when he does it now he'll decide what he does next amen god's already determined what he's going to do so that gives us a absolute rest and and god spent a lot of time in the message trying to bring us rest and in the word showing us in the scripture what our position in christ actually is amen i want to read a large section here on a smyrnan church age as we lay a foundation so to go on these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of god which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but these same elect are called by another name romans 4 16 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all when skip down he reads a few more scriptures but he gets down in the comments on this verse we just read according to romans 4 16 we find that god has given a sure promise to all of abraham seed and paul puts himself in all believers under this designation because he says abraham who is the father of us all then he goes then he goes on to not only narrow down his definition but rather to finalize it for the galatians for in galatians 3 he identified the seed singular with jesus and counted the seed children as children of promise and promises as having to do with election or the choosing of god and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed or the elect of god and are the predestinated foreknown of god and were in the mind of god and his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decrete season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride spoken word see bright just what jesus christ was a spoken word seed amen she is also a spoken word seed he's the spoken word seed bride groom she's a spoken word seed bride [Music] and though she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of christ it is very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him come from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting god in a mini-membered body whereas once god was manifest in one member even our lord jesus christ so as god was manifested in one member nobody in christ him will deny amen that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen and that he was expressing god in one member that will never be denied that will not be argued about if it is it's not an argument i've ever heard amen but where the rub comes in this day is that whatever that was expressing in that one member is now the same thing expressing in a mini-membered body that's where the rub comes down that's where the mystery is amen that's where the revelation of this hour the word made manifest for this hour the light of the hour amen if you walk in the light as he is in the light this is the current present tense light that whatever was in god amen whatever was in christ amen working and manifesting the word amen that same thing is in a many members what was in one member is now in many member body expressing his word so we don't want to make it two different things amen it's the same thing and when we make it two different things and when we begin to lose the mystery and lose the revelation and obscure what god is doing in this day he said he goes on to say now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifest in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal his thoughts in our turn become the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quick and in non-seed there is nothing to quicken so we realize we come back to grace because it's god's love it's god portioning himself out it's it's a portion of god a seed a piece of god amen that was inside of us that has the capacity to recognize the light for our day and believe it and by faith we are justified so it's not something that we've done we couldn't do it there was nothing we can do so it takes away the whole concept of mental ability the whole concept of being able to comprehend or understand or or to explain it in such a way to get a mental agreement to say that we have another believer amen the denominations are full of that but that's not what he's looking for he's looking for his lost sheep he's looking for his seed he's looking for his children amen and they have the capacity to receive the word in the light of the hour very simple very very simple amen it's so perfect that he can use a man amen with broken grammar and a seventh grade education who comes out of the hills of kentucky amen it's so perfect this power of revelation and faith that lays in the seat that he didn't choose an outstanding speaker although i thought brother ben was an outstanding speaker but he didn't choose it in one that would have it grammatically correct amen or or one that would be such a skilled teacher that he could lay it out so smooth amen that you could just connect the dots but the way brother branham preached is he would drop something here change subjects and talk about something else amen and move back to the thing he was talking about amen and and what what's he it's almost like what are you doing i don't understand why couldn't you make this easier amen because it's hidden and revealed in simplicity it's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent revealed it unto the babes that's how perfect this power of revelation is to the seed because whatever that word is that's being preached there's a matching part inside amen the children of god and the two have a magnetism that attract to one another it's not a coercion amen it's not a group effect amen so many times i see you know somebody many times not always but sometimes you see somebody will become interested in the message and and all of a sudden they'll strike up maybe a friendship with some believers and all of a sudden the people pour it on amen and they think if we could just get them to meet everybody and be friends and everybody friends amen they'll come in they're not going to come in by friendship amen they're not going to come in by friendship i mean that's why many times when when we we this is just a little secret many times we have a visitor or somebody come to the church and they're new i'll leave them alone for a while i'm not to be rude but i don't want a personality to be an attraction i don't want it to be a an overwhelming friendship or or a an extra amount of warmth or pouring on something because the reality is amen if you're going to be in the bride and you're going to be part of any local body amen there's going to be some rough times that come and there's going to be some things that aren't so sweet and so friendly and so easy to manage amen and i want to know if somebody is coming for the word are they coming for friends they're coming for family are they coming for the word amen and so so sometimes not to be rude in any way but sometimes i'll just leave somebody alone for a while because i don't want him to say oh he's so nice he's such a nice they're so nice over there and they're so welcoming and i just feel so welcome and i'm just so we should welcome people please don't misunderstand what i'm saying we should be nice please be nice don't start being rude just to test people i tested him brother chad they weren't a believer please don't do that i got to be careful what i say but you know what when somebody comes to the word and comes for the word it doesn't matter if nobody talks to them that day shakes their hand they may have hurt feelings but they're not leaving the word we want to be friendly we are friendly we're sweet we're loving we're kind amen but that's not the attraction the attraction must be the word and if the words the attraction all else will find its place amen he goes on in the same quote out of the smyrna church age hold this carefully in your mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death the shed blood brought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word word is in parentheses my sheep hear my voice word so if you're going to hear his voice you're going to hear the word my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in specie as we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognized that we are the sons of god we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me o my father i'm returning to thee now this is powerful now i i want to look at two scriptures let's go back to genesis chapter 2 or i'm sorry genesis chapter 3 and the light of what the prophet of god has just said about redemption and redeeming restoring bringing back to its original owner my sheep hear my voice amen the word amen my sheep hear my voice the word and hearing the voice they become aware of their father calling amen when they hear that word it's there's a familiarity there's a shepherd there's a father calling his child back home so and it says and then brother man says we've heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me or my father i'm returning to thee now i want to contrast that with genesis chapter 3. let's go to verse 7. and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself so here after god has has reformed the earth formed a garden of eden placed his son and his son's wife adam male and female in the garden then they fail they fall by not keeping the word he fell by disbelieving the word and adam fell by not keeping the word he didn't disbelieve it he knew what he was doing he went out with his hit with his wife he chose to to save her and now he he makes himself an apron of fig leaves to cover for his sin amen and now we realize that this is the start of religion because religion means a covering and when he covered his sin in fig leaves he started the first religion that was ever upon the earth but in his in his conscience he knows that his religion's not working because he may have been trying to convince eve and eve may have been trying to convince adam because they both had the aprons on and they now have were covering their sins amen but there was one person they couldn't hide from behind a fig an apron of fig leaves and in verse 8 says and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day so they heard the voice walking they didn't see god walking they heard the voice walking amen they heard his voice i've heard a voice walking in this day come walking amen and now they hid themselves because they realized their religion wasn't going to work and and god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou verse 9 and 10 he said i heard the thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself at no time in this exchange amen does it does it give us a clear distinction that they are looking at each other face to face he calls to adam where are you adam calls back i hid myself from you then god takes him and he covers in my clothes but we understand it was the voice of god noted the presence of god was there and in the presence of god because the voice of god he realized he had to hide himself because his religion was not going to work now let's go from here and go over to revelation chapter 3. it's the beginning of the book now let's go to the end of the book remember what starts in revelation ends in genesis all right what starts in genesis ends in revelation revelation 3 and 20 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice how is he knocking he didn't say if any men hear my knock he says if any man hear my voice if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will suffer with him and he with me brother brennan makes this statement he just injects a statement in the message harvest time so notice he never walked out with her she put him out the word rejected him he's referring back to adam and the woman when the woman fell adam went out with her knowing we was doing wrong but he went out with her to save her amen but now when we get to the end of the book the story is different now the church ages the latest in church age has put him out so it's the opposite now now what happened eve by her fallen condition put herself out amen from the promise of god put herself out of the garden and adam went out with her to save her amen but now god christ has been walking through the midst of the churches but at the end time he is put on the outside of the church and he is knocking with a voice the voice in this last day is calling amen those to open up and brother bear says to go out to him he's not coming back into laodicea but now he's calling for you to leave the fig leaf religion amen leave the hiding amongst the trees amen leave everything and come out and bury yourself before him no more fig leaves no more hiding no more pretending no more acting like everything's all right but the voice in the last day is calling us to come out from among her my people amen and we come out naked and bear amen having sinned and been born and said with nothing to cover ourselves with and when we come out to him then he gives us the word and we become clothed in the word and become his righteousness so we went one way in the garden but now it's the opposite now she the false bride has put her bridegroom out and he stands out calling to his bride to come but he's calling with his voice the word in this day and when you hear him knocking we go out and join ourselves to him leaving all the fig leaves behind no works no acts of righteousness that can cover my sin there's nothing the only thing that i can be clothed in is his righteousness his word so now in the end time the bride must leave the fig leaves must leave religion must leave false understanding must leave dogmas and creeds and ideas of men and she must go out to christ because christ has been put out of the church but he's been put out of the church amen to go back into eden and now he's calling his bride out of the church to go with him back to eden he cannot go back to eden alone is this clear because he declares the end from the beginning so the things that he had done in the beginning is declaring what the end will be and in the beginning amen there was there was one man alone in the garden and god said it was not good that man shall dwell alone i'll make a help meet for him so out of the man he took the ingredients to form the woman and he put the two back together and brother benham said that was the crowning act a crowning achievement of all of creation so and then after that he says it's all very good and he went to take his rest there was no more work for him to do he had completed what was in his mind and now that's the picture that we're being restored back to so when when when christ is put out of the church he's free to go back to eden but he cannot go back to eden by himself he has to have that masterpiece in the right image to go back to eden so he has to have if there's going to be a masterpiece family there's got to be a he was the masterpiece bridegroom now there's got to be a masterpiece bride so there is a necessity for a bride there is no option for a bride there has to be a bride the prophecy shows there'll be a bride the type in the scripture shows there'll be a bride and then the word in revelation shows there'll be a bride there absolutely has to be a bride without spot and wrinkle and she has to stand in the glory and splendor of him she has to be a man adorned for her bridegroom let's turn to hebrews 11 and look at a couple more scriptures and what shall i more say this is 11 32 hebrews 11 32 and what shall i more say for time shall fail me to tell of gideon and the barack and of samson and of jephthah and of david and also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and the others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging jay more over of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted were slain with the sword they wondered about in sheepskins and ghost skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so when we look back to the heroes of the faith and we look look back to hebrews chapter 11 amen it's astounding we we talk about david and we talk about samuel and we could go through and we could take each one of these lives and point out the supernatural and these are heroes let's say these are bible characters these are individuals who did exploits for the lord they've been our heroes they've been uh they've been so highly esteemed in our thoughts all of our lives we've been raised in christianity daniel you mentioned daniel oh daniel the great prophet you mentioned david the great king you mentioned all of these ones you mentioned them and samson and all that he did and all that they've done and all of their glory and all their mind they're our heroes but yet they without us are not yet made perfect like there's a dependency amen on the scriptures to come to fruition to come to the fulfillment there has to be a bride at the end time there has to be a capstone there has to be a bride there has to be one that completes this scripture completes this work finishes her course and does what she's predestinated to do and all of the scripture and every bible character in all is waiting depending on this manifestation to come to perfection that's why that's why when you when you come and recognize who you are and get your position all heaven is behind you i mean it's all heaven is behind you because all heaven is depending on you now remember this is the mystery this is the great mystery amongst the gentiles christ in you the hope of glory now if you look at that the way it's ordered christ in you the hope of glory it didn't say christ in you the hope of your glory or of you someday coming to glory but it's christ in you the hope of glory all of glory everything is depending on god keeping his word and finishing whatever went wrong in eden has to be restored and brought back right amen and there's a predestinated people on the earth at the end time that'll be the ones that he comes down and lives inside of you and does the work to restore back and finish complete restore what's been broken so when you think of daniel and how wonderful daniel was in abraham and how you'd like to shake his hand and samuel what a mighty prophet he was in all the works he does just remember that as much as you're admiring daniel daniel is admiring you remember brother branham went to the sixth dimension and when he got over to the sixth dimension amen he he couldn't even find words to express how wonderful it was he didn't want to come back amen he had a wife laying in the next bed over next to him and and he didn't even want to go back even though he had a wife there and children there it was so beautiful and so perfect but he makes he makes this statement he said i want to see jesus he said you can't see him he's a little higher so you begin to realize even in the sixth dimension they were still under a limitation they had not fully realized the promise you cannot fully realize the promise that you come into your perfect triune being they had two parts they had a redeemed soul amen and they had their theophany bodies but their glorified bodies they had not yet amen and so they they could not they'd not haven't finished the course they're still limited you say but but they're in glory they're in paradise it's wonderful brother branham couldn't describe it yet they were not settled there to stop there they mean they were all rooting for brother branham amen they were calling for him to press the battle to press on amen to finish the course to finish this thing because we're hung out here no matter how perfect it is it's not complete yet it's not finished we've got to finish our part for them to be able to move from the sixth to the seventh dimension you can say they're stuck in the sex i wouldn't say being in the six is stuck that gives the wrong impression but yet they are still under a limitation there's something yet that has to happen there's something yet that has to be finished there's part of the redemption cycle that is still cycling through and has to come to fullness and then before they can even be released i don't even want to use the word released because it sounds like bondage but so that they can fully realize the fullness of the promise brother brahm says in the statute of a perfect man you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when christ does come so now they're they're there those people are there waiting on us depending on us and don't think they're not rooting for you see there's a necessity for a bride there has to be a bride there's got to be somebody taking manna's word amen they live their portion and because they live their portion amen they created the circumstances where i can now live my portion if they hadn't lived their portion there would be no word to progress to move along there would be nothing for me to stand upon to make the next step on the ladder they live their portion of the word to get us to the place where we are now amen and now we have to live our portion of the word to get the whole thing back to the place where it needs to be every step every rung on the ladder has had predestinated seed in their season to move the kingdom to further the cause to move redemption up one notch one more step amen and now if we don't take the last step they all are hung up on this step you realize the whole movement of christ the whole movement of the word is moving up to this step dependent and waiting on an end time bride of people in the last day to make that final step and when they make that final step everybody that made a step on this ladder moves with the final step remember i was with moses i was with noah you remember that when they crossed the red sea brother said i was there amen why because it's the word if you're the word that's the word every part that's the word is all the same thing and it's not been me and you and you and me it's been the word moving all the way through to bring about redemption and when the word moved back there i moved with it because in me is an attribute of god is the word so when the word moved i moved that's why when the word come in fullness it was nailed to a cross amen i paid the price brother said i paid the price for my sins there on that cross that's why i'm not coming to condemnation i will not be in the judgment amen because i was already judged there because i am part of the word that's why we can believe the word is because we're part of the word so there's a portion to be fulfilled in this day brother bram says in the seed shall not be heir with the shock that's what the church is doing today for jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was to be fulfilled in his day it's the same word don't break it up and make it well that was jesus this is us i was there i was there and he's here same experience same life for when god separated adam he was both we find out adam was spirit to begin with the man he made man in his own image created him male and female and then genesis 2 and on he created man out of the dust of the earth man was created in god's image god is a spirit so he's a spirit man and when he become flesh man animal flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride he'd never taken and made another being but he took part of adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist spirit of adam left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part therefore part of his spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the way the bride is to christ and that's why the rapture of the royal seat has to come first and the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years then they were brought up at the white throne judgment there is no judgment to the royal seed or the predestinated seed of abraham no judgment you've passed from death unto life brother brahma it says in harvest time and in that day luke 17 20 i believe it is he's referring to 1730. jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not man the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself again among the people so he's telling us what the son of man is the word living itself again among the people see the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in jesus christ see this is why we're ambassadors for christ and when we stand on the word all of heaven is behind us and and it needs to be more of a reality and then there's just not a cute statement but it's an absolute reality that when we're standing on the word amen and we're staking a stand on the word and speaking the word all of heaven is backing us up because this is the portion of the word that has to be made manifest there's no return to eden there's no completion of redemption amen there's no resurrection of the dead there's nothing going to happen until this part is complete and i say lord complete it in me i don't my desire to preach this is not there's no desire in me to put pressure on people to conform because that's not going to work alzheimer's like oh man if i mess that up i'm holding up the whole resurrection well that's the truth but that kind of mentality will never get you anywhere amen but the realization that they're all depending on me all heaven is behind me i'm living the portion whatever it was in moses that gave the moses the power to overcome amen there's something greater than that in me to give me the power to overcome this day there's nothing that can stop the word there's nothing that can stop my forward march there's nothing that can keep me from filling god's purpose in my life because i'm part of this great chain of redemption it's not a forcing it's not a oh god help me i'm going to ruin the whole thing for everybody but realizing god is not going to let it be ruined [Music] you realize i hope i can express this in the way it's in my heart but god will allow something to be destroyed so he can make it back the way he wants it he found we find in genesis 1 genesis 1 verse 2 a world that's destroyed because it was in a condition he didn't want it in it was in chaos brother said under judgment from a previous civilization and god will allow that to be destroyed so that he can make it back to something he wants and god he has allowed the church ages the churches the denominations to go to absolute total ruin so that he could have a bride of his own jews god sometimes will allow our lives to come to nothing he'll allow our choices to fall flat our thinking to come to ruin his sometimes allow us to come to absolute destruction because he wants to make it the way he wants it i want to ask you genesis 1 2 was it a good thing or a bad thing was it a good thing or a bad thing the earth destroyed it just depends on whether or not you want an eden [Music] if you're one in eden then it was a good thing if you wanted to preserve whatever was there before then it's a bad thing i don't know it was there before all i know is eden so i think it was a good thing and when god absolutely destroys the thinking of men denominational systems creeds and dogmas and church systems amen is it a good thing or a bad thing that the church's fault to ruin is it a good thing or a bad thing that every system has failed is that a good thing or a bad thing i think it's a good thing because god has allowed everything man has done to completely fail amen so out of the ashes of that he can bring up what he's always wanted and he's wanted a bride of his own choosing so you say oh the world's falling apart look at everything look at the churches look at all that's falling apart i'm saying praise god let it fall apart amen because he's trying to build what he's always wanted he's always wanted a bride of his own choosing and at the end he's going to allow this world to completely be destroyed amen and burnt over amen so that we can have a millennium amen how many once a millennium if you want a millennium then then the fires in california aren't a bad thing the earthquakes in diverse places aren't a bad thing the storms and the hurricanes and the floods it's not a bad thing it's a bad thing to human life it's bad it's sad we don't like to see it but when you back up and look on the grand scale of things this earth is longing to reproduce itself for a millennium it's it's it's eager groaning looking for the manifestation of the sons of god that's what we're watching take place in the earth right now the earth is actually rumbling and moving amen to the maturity of the bride because it wants to bring forth a bright new world for a millennial reign is it a good thing or a bad thing it just depends on if you want a millennium or not if you want a millennium it's a good thing amen the government is absolutely falling apart america is absolutely coming to disgrace and ruin is that a good thing or a bad thing i say it's a good thing because the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and it's christ don't try to prop up what god is trying to let fall [Applause] don't prop up men's ideas of man's religion and politics and government let them all fall because what he's trying to bring out of that he's trying to bring and produce and declare and show a bride of his own choosing let everything else fall and don't let your heart be troubled don't let your heart be troubled look up thy redemption draweth nigh and i'll say it like this your redemption is here [Music] he is here amen he's here to complete the work in us it's essential that there's a bride i mean there's a necessity that there's a bride amen there is no millennium without a bride and until the bride comes the fullness and gets out of the way there's no expression of the 144 000 which is the redemption of all the jews from the time of christ and on the redemption of all the jews from the time of christ is on is dependent on there being 144 000 little benjamin that shows up right on time do you think all those souls under the altar under the sacrifice altar amen in the sixth dimension are not rooting for 144 000 wanting 144 000 to come on the scene wanting them to believe receive the message absolutely their white robes are linked they meant to the 144 000. but that 144 000 amen will not come to the revelation under the two witnesses until the bride gets out of the way there'll be no millennium until the bride comes to full manifestation you realize there has to be an end time bride and she's got to cut she's got to be everything the word said she would be if that's the case let's go back to moses there had to be a deliverer because he said there would be a deliverer there was a promise of a land for the children of abraham there had to be a deliverer bring them out of bondage into that land had to happen god had a man he had ordained before the foundation of the world to play that part and that man was moses nobody else could do it moses had to do it but moses failed his first effort failed he run to the wilderness running away from his commission when god come to get him back he'd been so humbled that he began to argue with god about whether or not he was even able to go back and be a deliverer failed running away out of a commission 40 years of nothing but god had no option [Music] but to come down supernaturally and get a hold of moses and bring moses back into the position to be the deliverer and to bring them out of bondage and bring them to the promised land why because he ordained it he promised it it's in the word and this is the ordained vessel he chose to use it he cannot change his plan and if he couldn't change his plan for moses remember i was in moses i was with moses i was there with noah i was there when they crossed the red sea and now i'm here in another form and in another expression amen and just like that couldn't fail this expression cannot fail amen i can make choices as a man i can make decisions that are wrong i can pay the consequences for that i can step to the right or to the left i can create all kinds of troubles but god can't let me go and pluck somebody else out and put me in the place and said that's my bride no because if he's ordained me and put my name in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and i was predestinated to be here then there's nothing going to stop that manifestation so it's not about me trying really hard it's not about me i mean grunting under the pressure of self-will it's really me relaxing to the revelation of who i actually am and saying god i believe that with all of my heart and i'm totally dependent on you i'm relaxing now i'm yielding to you lord and letting you do the work because if we decide what needs to be done to manifest the bride i guarantee we'll decide wrong i think this manifestation would be right and i think this manifestation would be right and we're going to make the decision wrong what we need to do is relax and let his spirit be he guide us move us into every manifestation that he wants because there has to be an end time bride it's got to be made up of every predestinated member and it's got to stand completely a hundred percent on the word and there is no option now if you believe you're part of that then you have no option you may think you have an option but you have no option amen you have no option it's going to be there and it's going to be that way he'll not lose one so now what do i do i just recognize who i am i feed on the word my husband the revealed word in my mate and let him let him do what he's always intended to do with me but shouldn't it be this brother says it shouldn't be that it should be exactly what he does through you it may never make the newspapers but it's exactly what he wants to do through you it may never it may never make a a a voice book or a twitter post but it'll be exactly what he wants to do through you see we've got to get our own mind out of this thing and let the mind of christ take control in the unveiling of god brother says now if you'll notice in the beginning one word page one in the bible in genesis one we find out that that the whole all sickness all sorrow all heartache and everything that's ever happened to human beings came because one person disbelieved one word caused all this that's the first of the bible and the last of the bible revelation 22 the same god said whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it see it must be word by word just the way it is so therefore and just take the little thing like some someone always going to me going on to me about the women bobbing their hair now to me as long as she does that i don't care how saintly she does and how much she knows she is still wrong she wears shorts and these clothes like that i don't care what she does how much she can sing how well she can preach whatever she could do what kind of life she lives is still that one word is broke see it's got to be every word not a sentence a word one word so the bible is no private interpretation it must be word by word the way it's written we must believe that and not only believe it but live it if we don't live it then we don't believe it we just say we do basing back to what i said the disciples could not explain it but they believed it anyway and they made their confession and lived to it when all the rest of them walked away from it they stayed with it they believed it that's the way we do that's the way you've got to do it no matter what anybody else does we believe it and then we act upon it if you don't do it then you don't believe it now that's just the natural outflowing of faith so we we want to stay with the word and keep the word and leave our own thinking out of it and just take the word there's a i want to read this quote on the masterpiece and show what brother betham said he's talking about the the vision he had of the preview of the bride so and i just started to bow my head and i said and he said wait the bride must come again and i looked and here they come again and they passed by a sweet looking little ladies they was all looking right at me there's your first clue they was all looking right at me who were they looking at the seventh angel because the seventh angel was pointing out the seventh seal amen so they passed by sweet looking little ladies they was all looking right at me as they passed by and noticed each each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of a long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been german or something like that and i watched them further down he says and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago looked like or just recently see did you notice the bride come in view twice the first seed and the second seed both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dressed in different parts shall come from all nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair and no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me what must i do brother chad we got to be in the end time what works do i just watch him watch that prophet that prophet will point you the way. they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all nations see see each one representing the nation as they march perfectly in line with the word and then i i have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if i don't watch now look when they went by it was a it was a preview or a review booth and he's standing in the booth watching them march by and he watches the first church go by and they're everyone in step with the word they're perfect amen hair hanging down looked sweetly everything was just right amen and then the second one come by and it was the worldly church and he said all the vulgarity and the filth and everything and they went off into destruction and he bent to hang his head because he was so disappointed and discouraged that of all his work that's all that he could produce a bride for christ and all of a sudden he could hear music coming he said there must be another one an onward christian soldier and all of a sudden one began to march by exactly like the first one and he said they looked just right at me and they were marching right in line with the word see when they were looking right at him they were marching right in line with the word and he said i had to watch them he said if i didn't watch them let's read it again i have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if i don't watch when she is passing by if she gets by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when i'm oversea when i'm finished or whatever it is she passed by him and he saw two get out of step and he's crying get back in step and he said see when they pass by me and he's musing thinking maybe it's after my time after i'm gone that she'll get out of step now he never quit watching her but what happened was she quit watching him she'll get out of step with that word if i don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when i'm over see when i'm finished or whatever it is they was getting back trying their best and was getting back just get in line because he hollered get back in line they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos but the front was never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepping out a little bit to the right hand side and looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by they was just past me oh far as here to the wall just past me and i was standing there and then i just seen it all move out and leave but you notice the church only come into view once this is the false church not the bride the church the church only come into view once each nation the church but the bride come in twice see see what it is it was now not knowing it but looking at it with with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at nicaea that was the original seed and she came through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days i will restore see the masterpieces brought up we know out of those seven denominations seven church days we know that there was a bride in each one that'll be gathered up amen and it'll be gathered up and gone amen but now he's saying now it's not in there anymore that church has gone off into total apostasy but whatever the church was at the beginning amen it will be at the end it's restored back to its original condition amen not the church anymore but the bride that's the reason she was in view the second time she was reviewing the first time then she was reviewing the second time and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh god have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride come back because she was alpha and omega god the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it's a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the garden of eden and took a piece from and made another piece and that was martin fell now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth his masterpiece and was smitten in order that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again that masterpiece again so the masterpiece and the son of god the masterpiece and the bride and it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the lord it must be the fulfilling of the word and it is the fulfilling of the word just as he was the fulfilling of the word this is the fulfilling of the word we're not here by chance we're not here just trying to make our way through this world got to get that image out of our minds you are no more just trying to make your way through this world any more than moses was just trying to make his way through this world any more than the apostle paul was trying to make his way through this world or any other elect predestinated seed of god you're just as much not here just traveling randomly through trying to figure it out and do the best you can you are ordained amen to be here in this eighth you have a position in the masterpiece amen and all of heaven is depending on this bride amen coming to the perfection of the fulfillment of all the word all heaven is behind it god is for it god is moving it god is making it happen amen we just need to yield ourselves completely to that and just trust and just rest and have joy why should we have joy why should we have such freedom amen listen that little sheep that has a shepherd watching over him that little sheep is an absolute freedom with no string attached because that that sheep can run and frolic and play in the field and go by the still waters and have a drink and lay down and romp around because it knows that there's a shepherd watching making sure there's no predator that's going to come making sure that the sheep's not going to eat the wrong kind of food making sure the sheep doesn't get off the path into danger because every time that sheep eats the wrong food he corrects the sheep and every time that little sheep gets on the wrong path his rod of correction comes down and corrects that sheep amen and thy rod and thy staff they comfort me and why does the shepherd do that to that particular sheep amen because that's his sheep and he's not going to let his sheep eat wrong food his sheep get lost his sheep get injured he's watching over his sheep and that gives the sheep the freedom to play in the field we should be happy people not tense and nervous every second i'm going to mess up and i'm going to make a mistake and i'm going to ruin it for all of all of creation there's a true reality amen that the portion in you has got to come to full fruition it has to there and we can slow down we can hinder the work of god that's what brother branham told us that's true but we don't wring our hands in fear we should be happy people in trusting the lord that i've got a shepherd this is his plan he called me i didn't call myself he chose me i didn't choose myself he ordained me before the foundation lord i didn't ordain myself he placed me in this position in this time in this body and i'm free and i'm happy and i'm enjoying it because i have a father who watches over me i have a shepherd who makes sure if i eat the wrong thing amen if i go and i eat the wrong kind of doctrine he's going to bring a correction [Applause] i'm free to enjoy the message i'm happy to feed on the word and enjoy the word because there's a shepherd that if i get off he will correct me in his rod and i staff they don't scare me his rod and my staff they comfort me i'm not afraid of being lost i've never been lost not that this flesh hasn't been lost not in this manifestation we come into the world lost but he knew where i was in my perspective i was lost he had to find me and redeem me back because of the fall but he knew where i was he knew where i'd come forth he knew who his sheep were he knew she could hear his voice and all he had to do was make the call and she would come running thank you my name was on the last book of life this portion of me brother said maybe not the name you have now but whatever denotes the seed on the inside of you was written in that last book of life before the foundation of the world and he's not losing that book he redeemed that book now it comes down into a fallen condition and fallen flesh with a fallen mind and that has to be bought back that's what was lost but he knows who are his he knows who's written in the book do you understand and all that is written in the lamb's book of life he said shall come to me and i will no eyes cast them out and i will lose none don't be afraid be happy but god has a rod of correction that should make you happy i don't know i don't know sometimes where we get the wrong ideas because they don't come from the scripture but sometimes we get the wrong ideas that somehow i'm going to be uh i'm going to mess up and god will cast me away and never take me back that somehow i'm going to mess up so big this time so big this time that he won't forgive me this time see that's how humans act but that's not how god acts but the real reality is if i was in him i'm going back to him and do i do wrong things yes do i do it intentionally sometimes yes have i felt his rod yes but he's a good shepherd and his rodney staff they comfort me i know he will not let me get too far without bringing the crowd down on my back does it hurt yes is it disappointing absolutely do you cry buckets of tears is it devastating to you absolutely but he not going to lose you he's not going to lose you you go wayward he knows how to get moses out of the backside of the desert he knows how to get jonah over to nineveh he knows how to get elijah to finish his finish his commission he knows where to find us and he knows how to put us back in our commission don't don't let the devil lie he's a father do children do do children want to please their father yes do children get nervous when they make a mistake knowing correction is coming absolutely but with the right kind of relationship between father and son or father and daughter there's a peace that comes with having a father there's a rest that comes with knowing i've got somebody who's watching over me and we've got somebody who's watching over us will he let you make mistakes of course because those mistakes work right around to his glory will he let you fail absolutely because sometimes it's the very thing he needs you to do so you learn the thing that you need for what comes next that's why israel and his staff they comfort me i say thank you lord i appreciate that in the end time sign seed he says he is the word he is the word when you receive the word you receive jesus for he is the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we believe that don't we every bit we believe that christ is god's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing catch that when you receive the word you receive jesus for he is the word the word was made manifest and dwell made manif made flesh i'm sorry and dwelt among us we believe that don't we every bit we believe that christ is god's word made manifest and we believe that his bride must be the same thing is what the word made flesh god's word made manifest we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head i want to take a look here at something brother bam says in the seventh seal and we're going to go to colossians let's go ahead and turn to colossians we'll read that in just a minute back to colossians 1 where we were and the seventh seal brother ben says it's an old battle that started way back beyond time and then they satan and his angels was kicked out and when they come to earth the battle set in again now if you notice i'm taking a little different direction but it's going to tie together so hang with me on this little turn and when they come to earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word let's back up and i want to go through this again it's a battle that started way back beyond time this thing that we're in what we're doing here on earth right now has everything to do with what happened back beyond time that's why i said when we're here we're not just here eeking out in existence we're not just here because a man and a woman got married and decided to come together and in their love they produced a child and that child is now trying to do the best he can on this earth no we're here in the form we're here because of what happened before i don't understand all of that i cannot calculate and compute it and make it make sense but there's a link between heaven and earth because brother bam tells us what you see here is a reflection of heaven it tells us what you see here you say you see a tree struggling for life it shows there's a tree somewhere that doesn't struggle for life this is a reflection of that amen and there was a there was war there was a battle that broke out in heaven amen in that battle that broke out in heaven moved down into the earth he says what he says saint his angels was kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word the battle is between god's word and satan he's trying to get the victory over god's word and the only way he can get the victory over god's word is when one of his subjects lets down the bar from the word satan himself cannot defeat the word of god i i hope you can catch what i'm saying satan himself cannot defeat the word of god so in order for him to get victory there has to be somebody one of the subjects of god to let down the bar on the word now you see why he fights you every day he cannot defeat that word he cannot overcome that word so what he's trying to get us to do is lay down the word or bypass the word or skip the word because if one of the subjects can let down the bar on the word then he can get victory again and as long as he can get victory again his demise amen has been delayed his demise is delayed as long as he can get this victory as long as he can keep winning a battle here and a battle there he can delay or prolong his pronouncement his judgment his demise amen and what has he got to do this is what brother branham said from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word see now we realize we've mentioned this before many times but there's a battle going on and you're caught up in the middle of the battle and it's a fight between satan and god's word because he's trying to stop god's word he's trying to defeat god's word and now you are the manifestation of god's word god's word is in you and this is why he fights you every day he brings every trap every trick every mental oppression every fear every anxiety every difficulty he can upon us because he's trying to stop that word from coming to full manifestation says in the greatest battle ever fought this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven i want you to hold on to this for me with me for just a minute sin did not start in the garden of eden sin started in heaven when lucifer rebelled against the word of god and he got some of god's subjects to let down the bar on the word and those subjects were the angels that were deceived are we together sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and satan come to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan come to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle began here on earth and begin in us it has been raging ever since so the battle become on earth and become in us and been raging ever since what's the battle the battles between satan and god's word god's word is in you amen you're born again by incorruptible seed by the word of god you are the manifestation of his word for this day and the battle is between that word and satan and he's got to get one subject to let down the bar on one word so that he can have another victory that's why the word had to be restored in this day because satan was having his way and then he built his satan's eden and he built a great conglomeration of religion and he was running all of all of religion don't make no mistake it's not like you know he's got the catholics but not the baptist he's got the baptism but not the pentecostals no it was all his design in the beginning religion was his design denomination was his design changing and altering the word by reasoning was his design from the beginning so whenever that happens it's his design his work he gets the preeminence in every one of those systems why you can't say well you know my so-and-so that i love at least they're not a catholic at least they're baptist it's all his design satan's eating his conglomeration of religion and so in the end time in order for god to have a great victory he's got to unlock his word has been bound up and he's got to give the true a perfect interpretation of the word so that the bride has the word so she's not letting down the bar on the word ignorantly anymore she knows the truth of predestination she knows the serpents see she knows the right water baptism she knows the oneness of the godhead she knows she knows she knows she knows so she cannot be deceived and trapped anymore into the false systems of man because that's satan's ideas get the victory over the word but god's calling out a word bride that'll stand upon the revealed word and she's looking to that prophet as she's marching because he's been given the correct interpretation of the word you understand when she looked at the other churches the ones going into ruins she got out of step with the word but when she kept her eyes amen on the seventh angel the one god used to bring the interpretation of the word and the opening of the seals when she kept her eyes there she kept marching in the step of the word so satan will try every tactic he can to get our eyes on the wrong thing amen so they can get us to step make make a misstep and get out of line from marching right in line with the word because if you get one subject to let down the bar on the word that's why i say stick with the message friends stick with the message read the books listen to the tapes know it for yourself god has given this message not to ministers he's given this message to his bride if you're his bride this message came to you it's not saying well we'll go to church and i'll let the pastor tell me what the message is no you the message is to you amen the fivefold ministry should just be a tool in god's hand amen to bring attention to the word to preach in such a way to catch clicker revelation in you amen but but the message wasn't given to the ministry and the ministry gives it to the people the message was given to the people don't let anything get between you and god no hierarchy no system amen this message was given to you stick with the message stick with the prophet read the books listen to the tapes amen in that way when you're sitting in a service amen and all of a sudden something just don't strike right amen then just just say i don't know i need to look at that again don't reject it don't call it false but don't depend on some other man to know the message for you you keep your eyes on that seventh angel amen keep watching him because he was the one who was given the word amen hallelujah why because the devil will bring any tactic a friend or somebody with another doctrine or some other way to get your eyes on the wrong thing and if you get your eyes on the wrong thing and get out of step with the word and then the devil can get another little victory over the word of god and he's prolonged his demise amen but there's a bride predestinated ordained to stand upon this word there is a predestinated bride that's going to take the word and the revelation it was given in and she is going to feed on it she's going to become one with it she's going to stand upon it and nothing's going to move her away from it even if she has to say like the disciples you know he said uh eat my flesh and drink my blood what does that mean and she may she may have to come to the same place the disciples came and said i don't know why is that such a horrible statement for a message believer brother branham says this this and this what does it mean i don't know is it true yep amen just receive the word from the vessel god sent to give the word to from and don't don't try to make it make sense when it doesn't make sense all you're going to do is twist the word if it doesn't make sense to you then just believe it and don't have to explain it and there's nothing wrong with talking about it asking questions there's nothing saying well i it could be this or it could be that there's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't start locking down on those things then you're going to wind up out of step because we're now we're not looking amen at the prophet anymore for the correct interpretation of the word now we're starting to use reasoning ourselves again to try to find a solution to the puzzle that's in the message do you understand what i'm saying that's a tactic of the devil stay with the prophet and if you see it by revelation then say it there's nothing wrong with that if you see sometimes one it'll just click and you've got it i know it that's it praise be to god you don't have to be afraid of the word either but just stick with that prophet friends know it for yourselves because the devil is trying to get one subject to let down on one word but there's a predestinated bride that won't fail on the word all kinds of tactics all kind of trips trips and traps and land mines th this this world this civilization all around you is covered with landmines tripwires and traps and all kinds of devices of the enemy all around you friends don't be scared you've got a shepherd don't be nervous you've got a father keep your eyes on that seventh angel keep marching and step with the word if you get off to the right or the left his rod and his staff they comfort you he'll keep you marching on the word because all of heaven is watching you depending on you to finish your part don't be nervous don't be scared let's look at colossians now i want to finish up by looking at two passages of scripture in galatia and colossians and then in hebrews colossians 1 verse 15. who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created in that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities our powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminences for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross through the blood of of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight there's one statement i'd like to go back to verse 20 and catch there's a lot here i'd like to say but i want to go focus on verse 20. i'll read it again and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven brother branham stops right here when he's reading this and christ is the mystery of god revealed and he makes this one statement he goes back to reading he said watch where that reconciliation went let's read it again whether they be things in earth or things in heaven christ was here reconciling all that was lost reconciling everything into himself and in that reconciliation he was here on earth living in a body of flesh he died on earth in that body of flesh that body of flesh bled it died amen but through that act somehow it was also reconciling something in heaven because sin didn't start on earth sin started in heaven and now he comes in the body of flesh to reconcile all things by him all things whether they be things on earth or things in heaven so now we know that what happens on earth is a reflection of heaven there's some tie in between the two and a reflection of one to the other and while jesus christ was here on earth living a life in flesh amen to live the full word and to die the death in place of all the predestinated seed somehow that act on earth was also reconciling something that was wrong in heaven something wrong in heaven something wrong in heaven i want to say that and hopefully i can show you out of the word what i'm trying to say when lucifer rebelled against god that was a terrible blow in heaven you realize it was it was a devastating thing that took place in heaven lucifer was a covering cherub amen one of two that covered over the mercy seat amen and and he rebelled from that place brother bam said his right hand man equal to god in all ways except creation and when he fell in the word and brought a deception that caused angels to fall amen that was a shock and a blow that hit heaven and he was cast out but now jesus christ is here on earth living out the word obedience to the word coming down in flesh i don't know how it works i don't know how to make it make sense to the human mind it may never make sense but something about this earthly journey something about living the word something about fulfilling uh all the word and dying amen is not just fixing what's wrong on earth but it's also reconciling heaven this matters let's go to hebrews and i'll lay this down too and hopefully god gives us some insight hebrews chapter 9. i i i hope that i don't know what i hope i'll just say what's on my heart and i hope it comes across right because we realize the heavenly realm is is there's something wrong because there was sin originated there lucifer rebelled there now there's still an accuser of the brethren that has access to heaven and will not be cast out until the bride goes up and when the bride goes up he comes down and he's there as accuser of the brother accusing day and night so how is he there there's something wrong in heaven if lucifer's still there accusing and remember when god had a message to give to gabriel gabriel sent out a message to daniel but gabriel was prevented from getting to daniel because there was a spiritual power a prince a supernatural force that was resisting gabriel an angel a messenger from god so there's something going on in the supernatural realm that we don't understand or see there's warfare there's battles there's hierarchies there's resistance there's principalities and powers both visible and invisible so the heavenlies if we say the heavenly uh the the the other dimension that we don't see let's just say it this way the supernatural the spiritual now they're still powers and forces and principalities there was a prince of babylon in the supernatural that had dominion over babylon that could resist gabriel gabriel was sent from the presence of the lord to bring a message to his prophet daniel because daniel asked a question you would think god has the power just to penetrate and do whatever he wants but somehow god has set up laws he's got he's got laws that he operates by he's got something in place amen that allows this prince over babylon to have the power to resist gabriel and gabriel could not overcome until he goes back and gets michael and michael and gabriel together overcome and get the message to daniel i would venture to say heaven needs to be reconciled whatever went wrong has to be made right on earth and in heaven now what all that means how it all works i don't know i'm just showing you the bible there's something there that's still in warfare there's something there says we war not against flesh and blood but about principalities and powers in heavenly places that means in the heavens principalities and powers in the heavens that we're warring against but i'm here on earth resisting this temptation in front of me i'm here on earth trying to keep the word for this decision no you're not warring an earthly battle you're fighting a principality and power in heaven and the heavenlies in the heavenly realm so now we realize our existence here this is what i want to get to us there's everything at stake on this bride coming to the full manifestation of this word everything at stake there's still principalities and powers in heavenly places that are resisting the bride they're still forces at work amen there are still things on this earth and jesus christ is reconciling in the body of his flesh all things whether they be in heaven or in earth and we've been given a ministry of reconciliation we are ambassadors for christ we are finishing the work that he started that's why all heaven is behind you and i we're not going to be defeated heaven's not going to lose god has had a plan and he's unfolded his plan he's going to he was going to have seven ages because he said before he would have seven ages and he's going to have seven ages not eight not six when he comes to the end he's going to call out a bride he's going to call her out by the word she's going to hear his voice and come running from the fig leaves and come to him and be clothed in his righteousness which is his word she's going to by predestination by his choice she's going to accept all of the word she's going to keep her eyes on that seventh angel messenger she's going to march right in step to the word and when every one of those attributes come to full revelation and manifestation of that word amen and satan can no longer get one subject to let down on one bar something is going to shift friends something is going to change what's all heaven waiting on us brother branham said it but i want to show in the scripture it's there's there's more than what we can think and what we can imagine when he says they're waiting on us oh heaven is waiting on us the reconciliation of heaven earth is waiting on us amen it's got to have a bride of his own choosing that stands on the word to prove that she won't fall fail like eve fell then he can take her out of the way go to 144 000. they'll take the word and stand on the word which will complete redemption for the jews from the time of christ on then he'll burn the earth over then we'll have a millennial reign for a thousand years see none of that happens if there's not a bride to express the word then after a thousand years there's a resurrection of the dead and at the resurrection of the dead there's a judgment set the bride's not going to be judged she's going to be the one judging the husband and wife will be sitting on the throne you can sit with me in my throne you know you're not you shall judge the angels this is all the scriptures we're standing there in judgment and people are coming up and there's going to be people amen who's going to receive eternal life having never named the name of christ because of the good deeds they did to the elect but do you realize their entrance into eternal life will never come until this bride expresses the word millennium will never come 144 000 never come everything now everything is hinged on you and i keeping the word the reconciliation of heaven of earth everything is wrapped up down to this one thing you and i believing this word and standing on the word this isn't our pastime this isn't something that we do on the side we're not a mechanic and we believe the message no everything in our lives is for us to believe this word and keep this word and all heaven is behind us let's go to hebrews 9. i just want to show this in the bible for jesus hebrews 9 and 19. hebrews 9 19 for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there's no remission of sins it was therefore necessary that the patterns of these things in heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifice than these for christ has not entered into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the truth but unto heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us i want to pay close attention to the last two verses i read 23 and 24. it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in heaven should be purified so the pattern was the earthly tabernacle the book and the people and the tabernacle and the vessels had to all be sprinkled by blood to be purged so it was necessary that the pattern of things in heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these i want to ask you why does the heavenlies need to be purged that's what he's saying he's saying the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifice than these you can't use the blood of bulls and goats to purge that meaning something in the heavenlies had to be purged because sin started in heaven something needed to be purged in heaven christ coming here on earth he came here on earth he lived in the body of flesh he died amen and then he went up amen and there was a purging taking place not just on earth but in heaven also i don't know the mechanics i can't explain it but what i'm telling you is something on earth can be taking place that will reconcile heaven and earth together and we're here in this body of flesh to continue the work that he didn't finish and we've been given a ministry of reconciliation it's not just about what's going on right around you in your circle it's more than just what you see with your eyes it's more than just what you experience amen in a carnal way of living this life there's something far more going on in our lives friends than we ever realize christ the high priest had to carry his blood into heaven the heavenlies needed to be purged i don't understand it i can't comprehend it other than that's where sin started and now he's working in and through the bride to finish his work what is his work the ministry of reconciliation to reconcile everything back to christ heaven is depending on us friends all the realms are depending on us the dimensions the things seen the things unseen it's all depending on us god promised it he promised it to be here he predestinated it it's here it will manifest she will stand on that word brother bam said when he came to earth the mystery of god revealed he was the tree of life do you believe that in rome what did they do he had to be chopped down he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he that hang on a tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a bride tree which will be the tree of life restored back to him as husband and wife in the garden of eden by the same word the same god made manifest in husband and wife and the same bride tree back again i want to read revelation 22 together revelation 22 1 we know this is after the millennium after the final burning and purging new heavens and new earth are here and the city has descended and resting upon the mountain in revelation 22 he said and he showed me a pure river of water of life clears crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street in either side of the river was there the tree of life which were twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations brother branham said that they'll come from outside the city in that great new heavens and new earth and they'll come from outside the city and the gates will be open all the time and they'll bring their tithe and offering into the city and they'll come into the city and in exchange for that they'll take of the tree of life a leaf and they'll go back out and they'll have peace no more war no more bloodshed no more troubles before they can ever come to that place there has to be a restoration of the bride tree before we can ever get there where all those that are saved at the white throne judgment can come in and take of the leaves of the tree of life there's got to be a bride tree restored back to a bridegroom tree the two have to become one there's got to be an expression of the tree of life restored back to him again and if we don't have that now it'll never be there then you realize all the nations and all the people that will be saved at white throne judgment are depending on the restoration of the tree of life heavens and earth the predestinated the elect in the sixth dimension they're depending on us all those that will be saved at white thorn judgment they're depending on the restoration of the bride tree when the tree of life will come back together again this is the hour this is the moment and this is our place brother remember says christ is the mystery of god revealed he said predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall would not fall are you chosen are you the chosen bride of the end time he didn't choose a bride that will fall this time he chose a bride that will not fall this time why because the nations are depending on the tree of life being restored because heaven and earth amen is depending on everything coming to the finish line he predestinated he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand i want to say friends stand on the word not on anybody's idea not on anybody's concept but stand on the word keep your eyes on that seventh angel keep marching to the step of the word there's a lot more at stake than we ever realized there's a lot more depending on each individual each subject holding true to that word of god amen there's a lot more depending on that than we ever thought no more compromise no more laziness no more bowing down just a constant saying god have your way god have your way every day in my life have your way amen everything is waiting on this bride to take that last glorious stand and god is working all the circumstances all around us every circumstance from every angle he's trying to get that bride into that position to take that stand you say that how do i know what to do you'll know what to do how do i know should i do this or should i do that he's not going to leave it up to chance friends he's not going to leave it up to some mystery i don't know what to do he's gonna put you in a position where you have no choice but to take the word and then the next situation will come along no choice but to take the word and it'll keep rolling like that until every attribute has had victory by the word amen and then satan's defeated no more deception no more lie and the cycle rolls on because we did what he called us to do he chose a bride that won't fall i hope doesn't free you to sin i hope that frees you from bondage hope that puts peace in your heart and say if that's what he wants that's what he'll have and i'm his let's all stand musicians if you could come i said like this this is not a frolic time this is a serious time but for the bride it's not a fearful time god foreordained this time from before the foundation of the world you think he's taken by surprise that the world is falling apart it's right on time amen you think he's taken by surprise that everything that was normal to us isn't normal anymore nothing all of society all the things that were so common and normal to us aren't normal anymore everything's changing at such a rapid place i say praise be to god god is finishing his work i want to encourage you as we finish this morning keep looking to the message of the seventh angel don't don't try to find your own way don't try to find our own way or look to this and chase this or chase that just keep your eyes focused on that message that god gave us read it listen to it feed upon it become one with it that word was here to guide us step by step all the way home let's stay true to that word if we don't understand it believe it anyways if it doesn't make sense believe it accept it anyways god will stand by that word god vindicated that man god will back up what that man said depend on it keep marching all heaven is waiting on us to finish this portion of our journey let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you for your word god i thank you for such a clear sound from a prophet who will say you've predestinated a bride not to fail whatever eve had done this bride's not going to do in whatever way she failed this last bride is standing upon the earth she will not fail by the word god not that we're able capable have abilities but our confidence is in you lord because you said this is the way it'll be we believe it lord you've given unto us a ministry of reconciliation i pray you give us lord that voice lord to declare your word that in this hour is it any seed that's out there remaining lost in darkness shrouded and covered over with darkness that the word lord penetrate god if there's another little woman of samaria coming to a well god how will you reach her now lord if there's another little woman that's trapped false understanding and a false life longing to know how to worship and where to worship how will you go to the well today and find her and speak to her you'll do it through your subjects lord you'll do it through us well we just pray that you would find every last seed that you would give us lord that wisdom to speak the word and make a clear distinction to sound the word out true and clear to live it and let our lives be a clear example of your word lord let your spirit flow through us help us to obey every word every line every jot every tittle every part of the word lord may we stand upon it may we live it may we display it may it be you and us doing the works god we love you we just want to freshly yield ourselves to you lord these things we can't always comprehend or understand god i know there's so much happening right now there's so much dependent upon us lord [Music] but god you've made a promise that we won't fail god i thank you for the peace that you've given us give us that joy lord just to rest knowing that you're leading to enjoy the good food you've given us to enjoy lord your presence god move us forward in your program and accomplish your deeds through these bodies of flesh as we yield ourselves afresh to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen god [Music] [Applause] till all the world just fades from [Applause] is my heart's to have the word made manifest in me living pure and holy unto thee this longing in my home that only you can satisfy oh how i long to be in love with you till all the world just fades from [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is my heart's to have the word made manifest in me living pure and holy one more time oh how i long to be in love with you till all the world just fades from a deep [Applause] word is manifest in me living pure and holy on to thee this longing in my praise the lord i just want to remind you all we have communion service communion defeat washington this afternoon we'll gather back here at 3 30. so we look forward to seeing you there i just like to say if god could take the blinders off of our eyes if for a moment we could see all the realms the heavens the earth the whole plan everything and how much of it is centered on each one of us as individual attributes if we could just have that glimpse and see it and know it and understand it i think every day would give us a focus a commitment to stay true to this word but god's structured in such a way that we have to come and not have that vision because it's going to be by the word and the word only it's going to be because the word is calling to the word and the word is responding to the word and god has made a mechanism which his promise will be sure and that's going to be by the word and for us we may not be able to fathom how much is going on in the heavens how much warfare all around us how much resistance and fight over us just fulfilling our portion we may not be able to see the great power that is backing us and pushing us into manifestations where we may not be able to see that but we don't need to god's given us everything we need to overcome and he's given us his word and he's given us something to believe that word and he's given a spirit to manifest that word and now our victory comes one decision at a time by staying with that word and god will have complete absolute victory in you and i because he said he would i don't know about you but i want to make a fresh fresh declaration that i want him to have preeminence in me i want you to move freely in me lord not my own thinking interrupt my own thinking with your word show me your word and let me live it lord for everything is dependent on that man god bless you will see at 3 30. like oh how i long to be in love with you till all the world just fades from you a deep calling to the deeper to have the word made manifest in me [Music] [Music] till all the world just fades [Music] [Applause] my heart's to have the word made manifest in me living pure and holy is [Laughter] the home for the presence of the lord [Music] separated [Music]
