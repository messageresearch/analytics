TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and as I've been looking at these Seasons to life there's not a one of us that doesn't go through some major changes in Seasons churches go through Seasons families go through Seasons individuals go through Seasons all of us go through certain times when everything changes and sometimes it's not like a meat cleav it's it's kind of it fades from one season to another you ever see the springtime and you know exact moment it becomes summer no you just realize huh we're in summertime now same when summer goes into fall fall goes into winter you don't know the exact time but you know the season changed you know the atmosphere is different you know everything's about to to change that has life you know life responds to that change in the season anything with life responds to the change and that season is caused by the Sun the sunlight changes the season its position and so does the the sunlight light up different portions of the word at different times for That season how many of you all you've read the Bible you read the same scriptures the same quotes over and over for years and it was good you you amen but then one day during a certain time and a certain season of your life it jumps off the page and almost smacks you in the face and you're like have I ever read that before and you know you read it before but the light now has brought it into view because it's a season for that word to be manifested in your life it's just a changing of seasons and not only do I believe the Earth is changing it's going through a major change we all feel the change is happening we know it even non-christians are looking and talking to me saying my goodness it's about to get bad they know the world is changing the churches know the world is changing the bride certainly I hope knows that everything is changing we're changing we're going from one season into another season we're going into the very depths of the Harvest time and that's the season I'm going to focus on tonight because that's the season it's no longer the springtime the planting season where there's an abundance of rain to bring in massive amounts of crops it's now the ripening time it's now the time time where everything dies everything begins to die and then you begin to think something's wrong no it's the season of death to make way for life
