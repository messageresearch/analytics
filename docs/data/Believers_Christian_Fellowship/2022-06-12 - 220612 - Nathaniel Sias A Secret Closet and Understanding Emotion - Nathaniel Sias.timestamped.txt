[12:57] heavenly father
[13:01] lord jesus we've come together today for
[13:03] just that purpose
[13:06] then we might be shut in with you
[13:09] just lost in your presence shut out the
[13:11] world around us
[13:14] and god we invite you
[13:17] into our hearts once again
[13:20] lord we just want to recommit
[13:23] the love that we have in our hearts just
[13:25] like a husband and wife lord we love to
[13:27] hear each other say i love you
[13:30] and god today we just want to say lord
[13:32] jesus
[13:34] i love you
[13:36] i love you for who you are
[13:39] i love you for your handiwork
[13:41] i love you for your saving grace
[13:44] i love you for your mercies lord that
[13:46] you have poured out
[13:48] above and beyond all of my imagination
[13:53] lord there are no words that can touch
[13:55] that
[13:56] but god i pray that you will hear our
[13:58] hearts today
[14:00] that we might worship you and praise you
[14:02] with a pure heart
[14:03] that you might be pleased you might
[14:05] dwell in our praises
[14:07] and god that you might come and minister
[14:09] to us today
[14:12] certainly there is nothing that i can do
[14:13] for any individual here
[14:15] but god you're a mighty conqueror today
[14:18] you're the same one that spoke in the
[14:20] earth
[14:21] was formed
[14:23] the heavens and the earth were created
[14:26] [Music]
[14:27] you're that same god today here we are
[14:31] your creation
[14:33] lord we ask that you'll have your way
[14:35] in jesus name amen
[14:39] praise the lord jesus
[14:42] i greet you all in the name of the lord
[14:46] it's wonderful to be with you again
[14:49] time goes on so quickly and there has
[14:52] been much that's been happening in life
[14:54] around the world and of course with
[14:56] those that we know
[14:58] many have been
[15:00] laid to rest here recently and
[15:02] not just here in this area but around
[15:04] the world there are many saints that
[15:06] have been passing on
[15:08] but you know
[15:09] it's just a few moments until we have to
[15:12] have fellowship with them again
[15:14] it's not long friends
[15:17] be at peace in your heart that the god
[15:19] that you have served all the way up to
[15:21] this point knows what he is doing
[15:24] he has not left you
[15:26] he has not forsaken you
[15:29] and in the moments where you feel like
[15:30] your heart is just rent into just look
[15:33] to him
[15:34] he is still a comforter today he said i
[15:36] must go so the comforter will
[15:38] come he's still that comforter today
[15:43] we're going to
[15:46] take a little thought today and if you
[15:47] would
[15:49] turn in your bibles to matthew the
[15:51] seventh chapter
[16:00] we'll just read
[16:02] some verses here and then have you be
[16:04] seated
[16:09] praise the lord jesus
[16:15] in matthew the seventh chapter
[16:20] we will read verses 14 through 17.
[16:25] matthew 7 verses 14 through 17
[16:30] because strait is the gate
[16:32] and narrow is the way
[16:35] which leadeth unto life and few there be
[16:39] that find it
[16:41] beware of false prophets
[16:43] which come to you in sheep's clothing
[16:46] but inwardly they are ravening wolves or
[16:49] ravening wolves
[16:51] you shall know them by their fruits
[16:55] do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[16:58] of thistles
[16:59] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[17:03] good fruit
[17:04] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
[17:07] evil fruit and let's read verse number
[17:10] 18 as well
[17:12] a good tree cannot bring forth evil
[17:14] fruit
[17:16] neither can a corrupt tree
[17:19] bring forth good
[17:21] fruit
[17:22] may the lord bless the word and you may
[17:24] have your seeds
[17:28] and if you don't mind you can turn down
[17:30] my monitors
[17:34] i really don't like to hear myself
[17:40] praise the lord it's good to be together
[17:41] in the house of the lord today
[17:45] you know as as we just mentioned uh and
[17:48] you can actually go ahead and turn them
[17:49] off my monitors up here
[17:52] um
[17:53] thank you very much
[17:55] there's many things that have been going
[17:56] on in the world today um
[18:00] and as we as situations are changing we
[18:02] are looking to understand the change of
[18:05] season
[18:07] what has god asked us for a year ago
[18:11] we looked back two three years ago of
[18:13] course
[18:14] situations have trained changed
[18:16] dramatically
[18:17] but as we said here today
[18:20] the one thing that troubles all of us
[18:22] many times as we are walking with the
[18:23] lord it is not
[18:26] it is not the the general direction if
[18:28] we've committed our hearts to the lord
[18:31] it's not a general direction that we
[18:32] question
[18:33] many times it is how do we take the word
[18:36] of god
[18:37] and apply it to our lives today
[18:41] we need answers today
[18:43] we need a gospel of good news that is
[18:45] applicable today that i might change the
[18:47] direction that i'm walking that i might
[18:49] walk in in a greater fullness of life
[18:52] each day
[18:53] to not stay stagnant to not be in one
[18:55] place but to continuously ever growing
[18:58] closer to the lord jesus does anyone
[19:00] have that prayer today
[19:03] if you want a greater dedication that
[19:04] means there is a greater dedication to
[19:06] be had
[19:07] there is a growing that we are growing
[19:09] too and in the moment when the harvest
[19:11] is full god calls calls in the harvest
[19:14] it's time to go home
[19:16] we're growing and god is maturing he has
[19:19] elect his children that are in the world
[19:20] he's allowing all of these challenges to
[19:22] come our way that we might grow up in
[19:25] him
[19:26] that we might know that the age that
[19:27] we're living in there is such a fine
[19:29] line we cannot be to the right we cannot
[19:32] be to the left there is a razor's edge
[19:34] that is right down the middle
[19:38] does anyone feel that
[19:40] you feel that in your heart that the the
[19:43] criteria the what is being required
[19:45] continues to go up
[19:48] and the difference between
[19:50] this side and that side
[19:53] grow closer
[19:54] and closer and closer
[19:57] we're going to by god's grace look at
[19:59] one element of this picture today
[20:03] this is an age-old
[20:05] discussion and many times a debate
[20:07] unfortunately but there are many
[20:09] thoughts that people have about
[20:11] how do i get closer to god and what is
[20:14] what does it look like what does it feel
[20:15] like what is the experience when i get
[20:17] closer to god
[20:19] when i go to pray what is my expectation
[20:22] when i go to a church service what is my
[20:24] expectation
[20:26] and things friends the thing that you're
[20:28] going to receive is your expectation
[20:31] so if you don't know what to expect what
[20:34] do you think you will receive
[20:37] you see as a child a child does not know
[20:39] what to to receive they don't know what
[20:42] to expect they are living by the hand
[20:44] that is feeding them
[20:46] but as a child is growing there comes an
[20:49] increase of responsibility where the
[20:51] child even as they grow do you want this
[20:53] food or do you want that food do you
[20:54] want to do this or do you want to do
[20:56] that small decisions are being put in
[20:59] front of the child that they might learn
[21:01] responsibility make decisions and buy it
[21:04] are learning to make better decisions
[21:08] but when we as adults are caught in the
[21:10] middle of not knowing where to stand the
[21:13] bible says
[21:14] that a double-minded man is unstable
[21:17] in all
[21:18] of his ways
[21:21] and let's apply that to us today if we
[21:23] come to a service and we don't know what
[21:25] the expectation is we are
[21:28] double-minded because we don't know if
[21:30] the expectation is this side or it's
[21:33] this side you know we we have all asked
[21:36] ourselves at some point the question
[21:38] especially as a minister as i stand here
[21:39] today i have to ask myself what is my
[21:42] expectation
[21:43] i look at i listen to the message i'm
[21:45] listening what brother branham is is
[21:46] preaching and he gets to the end and
[21:48] he's there's a discernment that is
[21:49] moving and i know i don't have that
[21:52] office i don't have that gift and i look
[21:54] at that and say lord how can i compare
[21:57] myself to that
[22:00] it poses a question
[22:02] because we say what is our expectation
[22:06] because we we are not another person
[22:09] i don't have the gifts of not only
[22:11] brother branham but i don't have the
[22:12] gifts of the other brothers that are
[22:14] ministering brothers that are here today
[22:15] i don't have your gift and you don't
[22:17] have mine
[22:19] we cannot expect the same as another
[22:22] individual because we are different
[22:24] parts of the same body
[22:26] [Music]
[22:28] if you have if you look inside of a
[22:30] watch there's all these intricate little
[22:32] gears you look inside of a car there's
[22:34] these gears that that you put it in gear
[22:36] and it takes the power from the motor
[22:38] and it transmits the power from the
[22:40] motor to the wheels well the holy spirit
[22:42] is in the church and all the moving
[22:44] pieces of the church are supposed to be
[22:47] moving together
[22:49] and you might have a big cog you might
[22:51] have a big gear and then you might have
[22:53] a little gear
[22:55] and they're both required
[23:00] get even a little bit more mechanical
[23:02] that big gear will get you going down
[23:04] the highway it'll get you going moving
[23:06] at high speed but when you've got an
[23:08] obstacle to go over you know what you
[23:09] have to do
[23:10] you have to downshift you've got to get
[23:12] a smaller gear
[23:14] well thank god i'm not a smaller gear
[23:17] you need that gear
[23:19] we need that gear we need every single
[23:22] part of the body we cannot argue it we
[23:24] can't get away from it because it's
[23:26] god's design
[23:29] and when we know exactly where we fit we
[23:32] know exactly what our expectation is and
[23:34] we're not double minded things start to
[23:37] click into gear
[23:40] and when things click into gear the
[23:42] power starts to get to the wheels
[23:45] [Music]
[23:48] we don't have to get out and push
[23:51] god already designed it perfectly
[23:54] but the problem is this satan cannot
[23:57] take from you
[23:58] the power that god gave you
[24:02] but he can make you think you have what
[24:04] you don't
[24:06] he can give you something that looks so
[24:09] genuine that when you compare the two on
[24:12] face value they are identical
[24:19] so close
[24:21] it would deceive the very elect
[24:25] if
[24:27] if it were possible
[24:31] but friends on face value they're
[24:33] identical
[24:35] well brother there's got to be some
[24:36] difference no on face value
[24:39] they're identical
[24:41] we're going to by god's grace pull this
[24:44] apart a little bit today one one aspect
[24:48] we could take many many months going
[24:50] through this subject by the grace of god
[24:52] the lord it will just help us to hit
[24:53] some high points today as i believe i've
[24:55] said here before that
[24:57] i used to always question why brother
[24:59] ram said i can only hit the high points
[25:02] i can only hit the high points well
[25:03] brother branham you've got two hours
[25:05] you've got three hours
[25:07] but when you look at god's word
[25:09] when you look at your lifetime
[25:12] we can only hit the high points
[25:14] we don't have enough time in this life
[25:16] to go through every detail
[25:18] but we're praying by the grace of god
[25:20] that god allows us to catch what is
[25:22] critical
[25:23] that we're not double-minded
[25:26] that we're so stable where god places us
[25:28] that when the devil begins to buff it
[25:30] our roots are deep enough that we're not
[25:33] moved
[25:34] now you might begin to sway
[25:37] but your roots oh i've heard this before
[25:39] and it's a wonderful picture to just
[25:41] share it for a moment
[25:43] for these very large trees the winds
[25:45] begin to blow and the tree begins to
[25:47] sway and the roots are so deep they're
[25:49] really holding on
[25:51] but what happens is it starts to
[25:52] slightly loosen those
[25:54] roots and it starts to create a little
[25:57] bit of space and you know what happens
[25:59] the roots go even deeper
[26:02] this is why god allows us to be buffeted
[26:05] so that we get we get so comfortable
[26:07] sometimes in our position and god wants
[26:10] us to be shaken so that the roots that
[26:12] we already have begin to grow and dig
[26:15] down even further
[26:19] when the storm begins to blow and all
[26:21] the little trees that have no roots
[26:24] are pushed this way and they're pushed
[26:26] over that way
[26:28] you can stand there in the middle of a
[26:30] hurricane and just wave your arms and
[26:32] say blessed be the name of the lord
[26:34] god is my conqueror god is my victory
[26:37] how can you stand there and say that
[26:41] but i'm drawing from something you don't
[26:43] see
[26:45] i'm drawing from something that's so
[26:48] deep down in there i can't give it to
[26:50] you have to get it for yourself
[26:54] so by the grace of god let's look at
[26:56] this little subject today
[26:59] a secret closet
[27:01] and understanding emotion
[27:04] this is an age-old discussion about
[27:07] emotion is there emotion is there not
[27:09] emotion and you know i love to take
[27:11] things
[27:12] brother the god gave us a prophet for a
[27:14] reason
[27:16] i don't want to make something up i want
[27:18] to see what the prophet said about it
[27:21] i don't want to put my imagination to it
[27:22] i just want to see what the prophet said
[27:24] well the prophet said that it must be
[27:26] that
[27:28] oh and let me touch on this just for a
[27:30] moment
[27:32] again an age-old well brother brandon
[27:34] made this mistake or made that mistake
[27:37] you know friends he might mix up some
[27:40] detail at some point
[27:42] and i would make this distinction
[27:45] the world is all about my truth my truth
[27:48] my truth jesus said i am the way the
[27:50] truth there is no other there's only one
[27:53] truth
[27:55] and what they're really arguing about is
[27:57] the facts you and i might look at one
[27:59] event you might see that one set of
[28:01] facts i might see one set of facts we
[28:04] might testify and somewhere in the
[28:06] middle
[28:07] is the truth
[28:10] and everyone is testifying about what
[28:12] they believe is this and they believe
[28:14] that but but god has sent something so
[28:16] balanced so perfect so beautiful right
[28:19] in the middle of all of it and even if
[28:21] the prophet of god might say something
[28:23] that is out of
[28:25] some detail maybe misquote a scripture
[28:28] the fact itself if you're looking at
[28:30] that
[28:31] you might say well i don't see how this
[28:33] compares
[28:34] and of course we would always i would
[28:35] always encourage you be extremely
[28:37] reverent when you say that because what
[28:39] the prophet's looking at might be
[28:40] different from what you're seeing
[28:42] he might have something that he's
[28:44] looking at this we simply don't see
[28:46] but the truth is he's a man
[28:50] he's not jesus christ himself in the
[28:51] flesh
[28:53] but he is
[28:55] but now he gets so close
[28:57] right is it is it not is it is it not
[29:02] but the the fact is friend it's even
[29:05] difficult to say it that way
[29:07] the fact
[29:08] might be
[29:09] slightly different than what we expect
[29:11] but the truth never changes
[29:14] you're not going to walk away from
[29:15] something that the prophet preached and
[29:16] said well i don't know about that
[29:17] message
[29:19] i mean some people may
[29:21] but if you're a child of god you can't
[29:24] because you're hearing there's something
[29:25] between the words there's something
[29:27] between all the little details as we're
[29:30] just saying brother randomly say i can
[29:32] only hit the high points i can only hit
[29:33] the high points then how are we going to
[29:35] get the details
[29:38] you got to go talk to the author
[29:41] i love with the way that brother adam
[29:42] said it someone was challenging him on
[29:44] his bible he says you don't even know
[29:46] your bible he said yes but i maybe not
[29:48] but i know the author really well
[29:51] friends do you want to know the author
[29:53] today
[29:54] because we can memorize the whole bible
[29:57] all of the scripture and all the quotes
[29:59] we can have all of that and that's not a
[30:00] bad thing
[30:03] but it must come alive
[30:06] you must be talking to the author
[30:08] because the only way you understand what
[30:11] ezekiel was saying isaiah was saying is
[30:13] that you have to be talking to the same
[30:16] inspiration that they were talking to
[30:18] the only way you understand what brother
[30:20] branham was preaching about is to be
[30:22] talking to the same author that brother
[30:24] branham was preaching about
[30:26] [Music]
[30:28] praise god
[30:30] we want such perfect balance
[30:34] perfect
[30:35] balance
[30:37] and we want to be so confident in that
[30:40] balance that we cannot be swayed
[30:43] not by life
[30:44] not by death
[30:46] not by trial
[30:48] not by blessings
[30:51] well how can you be challenged by
[30:52] blessings oh brothers sisters
[30:55] it's the hardest time to serve god with
[30:57] your whole heart when everything's going
[30:58] really easy
[31:00] you don't have any pressure there's no
[31:02] pressure on you oh praise the lord i can
[31:04] slack off a little bit today
[31:07] but when we realize that the time is
[31:09] short we only have a few more minutes to
[31:11] serve almighty god who gave his life for
[31:14] us there's an urgency within us
[31:17] as brother batteries gets to 50 years
[31:18] old he says boy you better do something
[31:20] for the lord because their time is
[31:21] running out he's had 50 years he's won a
[31:24] million souls he said i should have been
[31:26] 2 million
[31:30] lord jesus
[31:32] what am i doing
[31:35] what are we doing
[31:37] if we're standing on the promises if
[31:39] we're standing on the word of god
[31:42] if we're living in the mystery of god as
[31:44] we believe that we are then something
[31:46] has to be different from the world
[31:51] i love the way it's heard a brother say
[31:52] this in the last couple days he says
[31:54] there must be action
[31:57] god always brings action
[32:00] god always brings life
[32:05] we've read here in
[32:07] matthew 7 we're going to
[32:09] we're going to take a few terms today a
[32:12] few
[32:13] terminologies and and give them a
[32:15] definition and this definition is not
[32:16] from these definitions are not from
[32:20] uh the dictionary these definitions are
[32:23] from the things that brother branham has
[32:24] described we want to understand them in
[32:26] a certain way in a certain light
[32:29] based on what was going on through
[32:30] brother branham's ministry and what's
[32:32] going on today
[32:34] we're going to use again just a couple
[32:36] of these words
[32:37] let's take a look
[32:46] oh there we go
[32:52] legalism
[32:54] living a law
[32:57] instead of grace
[32:59] legalism
[33:02] it has to be this way it has to be that
[33:04] way it has to be this way
[33:09] pentecostalism this is an interesting
[33:11] one
[33:13] pursuing gifts of god as the objective
[33:17] not the giver
[33:18] the gift
[33:23] emotionalism
[33:25] pursuing emotion
[33:27] as the objective
[33:30] give all of these things put it let us
[33:32] put it today in the light of what is the
[33:36] objective as the prophet taught us to do
[33:38] where what is your goal what is your
[33:40] objective what are you looking to obtain
[33:42] where are you looking to go
[33:47] fanaticism
[33:49] my motion
[33:50] is my direction
[33:53] emotion is not even the the destination
[33:56] emotion is the driver
[33:58] emotion is the thing that you're moving
[34:00] by that is fanaticism
[34:03] there is no check there is no word check
[34:07] there is no aligning with what we have
[34:09] been taught there is no aligning with
[34:11] god's word i feel it therefore it is i
[34:15] feel that god spoke to me therefore god
[34:17] spoke to me and i need to question
[34:19] nothing
[34:23] brother branham talked about a rushing
[34:24] mighty wind he said brother he describes
[34:26] the situation he gives this example he
[34:28] says brother a rushing mighty wind
[34:30] struck me in the face and he said the
[34:32] first thing i would do is ask where that
[34:33] rushing mighty wind came from
[34:37] but brother it's so great it's so
[34:39] spiritual maybe it is but maybe it isn't
[34:46] do you see friends
[34:49] how we can get an unsure footing
[34:52] very quickly
[34:55] this is not for children
[34:57] spiritual children
[34:59] children are moving by the things that
[35:01] are in front of them they're moving by
[35:03] the situation they're moving by the
[35:04] direction of their parents by the grace
[35:06] of god
[35:08] but as we begin to grow up in the lord
[35:11] it's easy for us to move by this this
[35:13] thing or that thing or this thing or
[35:14] that thing and we
[35:16] think
[35:17] it is
[35:19] god
[35:23] but the age that we're living in now
[35:26] we're not called
[35:29] to have some variation
[35:32] of what god has given us
[35:34] not some watered-down
[35:36] alternative
[35:38] but the true
[35:40] pure
[35:41] simple word of god
[35:44] living in us
[35:47] so how can we do that
[35:49] how do we know that this aligns with
[35:51] this and that this oh lord i know for a
[35:54] fact that i'm standing exactly where you
[35:57] have placed me to be
[36:01] because when we are in that place let me
[36:03] give you an example of it one time there
[36:05] was a little boy
[36:07] and this little boy had been out tenting
[36:09] the sheep and there was a lion that came
[36:12] we've looked at this example before
[36:13] we're all very familiar with this there
[36:15] was a little boy and a lion that came
[36:17] and he grabbed it by the beard and he
[36:19] slew it
[36:21] that's not physically possible
[36:24] but it happened
[36:26] but why did it happen
[36:29] because david had a confidence in
[36:32] something
[36:34] when he walked out on the field with
[36:36] goliath he said this is what's going to
[36:38] take place
[36:40] there was a confidence that that david
[36:42] stood in a place and he said this
[36:45] is where god placed me
[36:47] i'm not questioning it i'm not
[36:49] wishy-washy i know that god placed me
[36:52] right here and i will not move for
[36:55] anyone no matter how big the giant may
[36:58] be
[36:59] the measurement doesn't matter the facts
[37:02] don't matter
[37:03] because the truth is beyond that
[37:06] the truth is beyond his strength it's
[37:08] beyond his weapons and the devil wants
[37:10] you to believe that his weapons are so
[37:12] superior to you
[37:14] or who are you
[37:15] little person
[37:17] but when you know where you're standing
[37:18] at a little humble child of god and you
[37:21] stand before your goliath and you say
[37:24] this is what will take place
[37:29] well are you sure
[37:31] convince me i can't convince you it's
[37:34] not for me to convince you it's for god
[37:36] to know to tell me to give me a
[37:39] revelation that i'm standing exactly
[37:41] where god placed me and in this place
[37:44] the only way that you will be convinced
[37:47] is to watch
[37:51] well david's just running his mouth
[37:53] again
[37:54] these these
[37:56] these believers of this end time message
[37:59] they just think they're so holy
[38:01] there's got to be some time where they
[38:03] slip up
[38:05] it's not that we never make mistakes is
[38:07] it
[38:08] we do
[38:10] god doesn't but we do
[38:14] but whose testimony do we hold
[38:17] is it ours
[38:19] no
[38:21] we hold the testimony of
[38:23] jesus christ
[38:26] if your testimony truly is not your own
[38:29] god will keep your testimony
[38:31] god will make your testimony what he
[38:33] desires it to be
[38:34] you cannot hold it
[38:39] david could not hold his own testimony
[38:42] he just showed up i like to say it this
[38:44] way he showed up we showed up today and
[38:46] we let god drive
[38:49] a lot of driving analogies today i
[38:51] suppose
[38:54] but we want god to be driving
[38:57] i'm here lord i'm a vessel i'm a vessel
[38:59] i can't fill myself
[39:02] i can't feel myself and i can't pour
[39:04] myself out
[39:06] i show up lord you do as you will
[39:09] brother you're saying aye i mean of
[39:11] course us in general not just this
[39:13] person here
[39:15] you know the beautiful thing about god's
[39:16] order
[39:18] a service like this this is not about
[39:21] just a person speaking behind a desk
[39:24] talking from behind a desk
[39:26] this is about you personally whatever
[39:29] you need from god
[39:31] you ever stop and just consider that for
[39:33] a moment
[39:34] you mean i can sit here in an audience
[39:36] and god can speak to me directly yes
[39:39] that's the
[39:40] truth
[39:42] fanaticism my emotion is
[39:45] my direction
[39:50] this is a terminology from modern law
[39:53] and business
[39:55] it's called a bait and switch
[39:59] it's when you're sold one thing but you
[40:02] receive something else
[40:06] and this has been satan's trick
[40:08] from the beginning
[40:12] he sold
[40:13] to eve
[40:15] one thing
[40:16] but she got another
[40:19] she did not understand the value of what
[40:22] she was giving up and she did not
[40:24] understand the value of what she was
[40:26] receiving
[40:28] there was something that was pitched to
[40:30] her or there was a sales pitch that was
[40:32] given to her
[40:34] and she took it
[40:35] there was a bait
[40:39] but then behind the scenes there is a
[40:40] switch
[40:42] you know i told them i'm going to give
[40:43] them this but really i'm going to give
[40:44] them this generic knockoff
[40:50] you
[40:50] know
[40:52] brother i need something from the lord
[40:55] you come sincerely and you begin to pray
[40:58] the devil wants to convince you at every
[41:00] single moment
[41:03] that you've already received
[41:05] what you're after
[41:09] he wants you to feel like you already
[41:11] have it
[41:13] feel like you already have it
[41:16] and if god gave it to you
[41:18] then his mission is to convince you that
[41:21] you don't have it
[41:24] it's like someone who is
[41:26] they're
[41:27] they're they're desiring to walk with
[41:29] the lord and and the devil's fighting
[41:30] them fight him oh you can never be a
[41:32] christian you'll never be a christian
[41:33] you can never do that you're never going
[41:35] to live up to that expectation it's
[41:36] repeated repeated repeated trying to
[41:38] beat them down beat them down beat them
[41:40] down and as soon as god begins to work
[41:42] in your life you know what he's going to
[41:44] do
[41:45] you're the best christian that's ever
[41:46] lived
[41:48] do you know how spiritual where you
[41:50] really are
[41:51] you are so s
[41:53] look around you
[41:55] look around you are more spiritual than
[41:57] everyone
[41:58] that's what the devil does
[42:00] if he can't get you on this side he's
[42:02] going to try to get you on this side
[42:04] and if you're going that way he's just
[42:06] going to try to help you along
[42:08] if you're in a ditch trying to get out
[42:09] of the other ditch he's not going to
[42:10] fight you to stay in that ditch he's
[42:12] just going to try to push you across the
[42:13] road
[42:14] now you're in the other ditch
[42:18] this
[42:18] is the constant challenge that god has
[42:21] laid before us
[42:23] we start walking with the lord and and
[42:26] satan wants to push us this way or push
[42:28] us that way
[42:30] abate
[42:31] and switch
[42:34] so let's summarize just for a moment
[42:37] legalism living a law instead of grace
[42:41] pentecostalism pursuing gifts as the
[42:43] objective
[42:45] emotionalism pursuing emotion as the
[42:48] objective
[42:49] fanaticism my my emotion is my direction
[42:53] an abated switch
[42:54] sold one thing
[42:56] but received something else
[43:01] now let's see what brother random says
[43:03] about this
[43:04] now this is this is interesting because
[43:07] a lot of these
[43:09] questions or
[43:10] discussion questions or discussion will
[43:14] revolve around
[43:15] uh well it was at this time through the
[43:17] 1950s it was this way and afterwards it
[43:20] was this way are there a lot of things
[43:22] that change after the opening of the
[43:23] seals you better believe
[43:24] it but there was something fundamental
[43:27] that brother branham was fighting long
[43:29] before that
[43:30] there was something that was taking
[43:32] place in the religious community in the
[43:33] religious world and there was a move
[43:35] there was a shift
[43:38] things had begun at azusa street where
[43:40] god had had
[43:42] instilled a revival in humanity and
[43:44] something was sparked
[43:47] that that revival was not about emotion
[43:50] that revival was about the restoration
[43:52] of the gifts the restoration of the holy
[43:54] spirit this is what the prophet taught
[43:56] us
[43:56] and i would love to go through every
[43:58] quote where brother branham referred to
[43:59] these things friends there's hundreds
[44:01] and hundreds brother branham talks about
[44:03] this all the time
[44:05] if we will listen and pay attention to
[44:07] those details
[44:09] but see there god is doing something
[44:11] here to revive in azusa street and if i
[44:13] recall correctly it took about three
[44:15] years after azusa street for the upc or
[44:18] the united pentecostal church to be
[44:20] created
[44:21] i don't know if it was called the upc at
[44:22] that time but there was a denomination
[44:24] that was formed around the movement from
[44:26] azusa street
[44:27] three years
[44:31] does that mean make the azusa street
[44:33] revival wrong no it does not
[44:37] what man has always done remember that
[44:39] satan is not a creator
[44:42] he cannot create
[44:45] all he can do is take what what god has
[44:48] done and pervert perverted
[44:50] do you know that satan doesn't even have
[44:53] any new ideas
[44:55] he can only look at what god is doing
[44:58] and try to pervert it even his ideas
[45:00] he's not a creator
[45:04] he cannot make something up you say well
[45:06] brother he all this this is this is uh
[45:09] everything that's going on in the world
[45:10] we live in satan's eat and all this
[45:11] perversion all the perversion is exactly
[45:14] the opposite of what god is doing
[45:17] he's taken god's vision he's taken god's
[45:20] model and he's perverted it and he's
[45:22] pushed it to the people he says look
[45:24] take this
[45:26] and in azusa street something was
[45:27] happening there was there was something
[45:29] that was instilled in the people and
[45:30] they were becoming so in tune with god
[45:33] it was preparing the world it was a
[45:35] spark that went around the world and it
[45:37] was setting the stage for a messenger to
[45:39] come
[45:42] and there were certainly people that
[45:44] were emotional that were there
[45:47] certainly
[45:48] there's wonderful stories of the man i
[45:50] don't
[45:51] uh i can't
[45:52] recall his name offhand but the man that
[45:54] was there the the pastor if you will
[45:56] that was at the azusa street mission and
[45:58] there were stories about him being
[45:59] upstairs they would pray upstairs and
[46:01] when something was out of order he would
[46:03] bang on the floor he could hear it from
[46:04] upstairs he'd be praying 24 hours a day
[46:06] there was someone praying
[46:08] let me ask you this saints let's
[46:10] challenge ourselves today when is the
[46:12] last time that we were always praying
[46:17] well brother that was for them
[46:19] but didn't god doesn't the scriptures
[46:20] tell us to be praying without ceasing
[46:23] god is calling us to something and this
[46:26] is where we start getting into the heart
[46:28] of our message today where there is
[46:30] things that get so convoluted and the
[46:32] things that are true get convoluted with
[46:34] the things that are wrong and we look at
[46:36] the things that people have done with
[46:38] god's word
[46:40] and we say that's wrong
[46:44] not what they've done we get confused
[46:46] about what god has done and we mix it up
[46:49] we say that whole thing all of that over
[46:51] there i don't want to touch that
[46:54] there are scriptures in this bible that
[46:57] if we read through the scriptures it
[46:59] makes us uncomfortable every word every
[47:01] line lord oh i love it praise the lord
[47:04] well not that scripture
[47:06] oh oh brother
[47:08] that's a little fanaticism there what do
[47:10] you mean it's fanaticism it's god's word
[47:13] well brother that would take a level of
[47:14] commitment that i'm not prepared to do
[47:17] ah
[47:19] there is our problem
[47:22] now granted friends there are times when
[47:23] we misunderstand scriptures and we need
[47:25] to seek god until we understand them
[47:27] properly
[47:28] we don't want to go without permission
[47:30] we don't want to assume we don't want to
[47:32] usurp authority over god and say well
[47:34] i'm going to go here when god hasn't
[47:35] sent you there in his word
[47:37] we grow in that
[47:38] be patient seek god but seek god with a
[47:41] sincere heart and don't become
[47:42] complacent where you are
[47:45] because there's not one of us here today
[47:47] that would say i'm as fully dedicated to
[47:49] god as i would like to be not at one of
[47:52] us
[47:54] because we're battling in this flesh
[47:56] we're battling against what god has
[47:57] given us we're right in the middle of
[47:59] this transition where god is calling us
[48:01] out of this world and we're living in
[48:04] this state in this condition but we
[48:06] don't want to be here
[48:07] we've been given a vision this is not
[48:09] where we belong
[48:13] there's something in us that is pulling
[48:15] let's go back to the azusa street
[48:17] mission
[48:18] because i want to highlight by the grace
[48:19] of god just a little timeline as we see
[48:21] the things that have been developing
[48:24] as brother branham is is addressing the
[48:26] pentecostals primarily the pentecostal
[48:28] church and in the late 1940s and moving
[48:31] into the 1950s and he's watching and
[48:34] cooling off of this revival in the 1950s
[48:37] he talks about it all the time
[48:39] he says it's been this many years it's
[48:40] been almost 50 years since the azusa
[48:42] street revival
[48:43] what has happened here what has happened
[48:45] here he's seeing that the life of god
[48:47] that spark of god that god has placed in
[48:49] the world this spark is beginning to die
[48:53] now this is before 1963 this is before
[48:56] the opening of the seals is before god
[48:58] really begins to move and he he changes
[49:01] from the direction of speaking to the
[49:02] world the pentecostal group that have
[49:05] come out of the the denominations at
[49:07] that time now they're beginning to move
[49:09] back into the denominational direction
[49:11] and brother adam is seeing this and god
[49:13] sees it as well god's not surprised by
[49:15] this and he's he started that move he
[49:18] set the prophet on the a in the age to
[49:21] begin to restore back to the hearts of
[49:23] the re of the fathers and now that move
[49:26] is beginning to go back into laodicea
[49:30] because god is calling out the church is
[49:31] called out there there are those that
[49:33] have come out of denominations praise
[49:35] the lord we want nothing but god we want
[49:37] nothing but god's word there's a
[49:38] wonderful little story of a man that was
[49:40] there at azusa street mission he had
[49:42] this box he would bring it he'd put his
[49:44] his head in a box
[49:46] in a cardboard box
[49:49] i tell you what friends if you're
[49:50] desperate for god you might do things
[49:52] that people consider strange
[49:54] people might call you a fanatic it does
[49:56] not mean you're a fanatic
[49:59] being called a fanatic and being a
[50:01] fanatic are two different things
[50:04] but when you're pursuing the spirit of
[50:06] god you will do things differently than
[50:08] what the world does it will cause you to
[50:11] change directions from what the world
[50:13] does the way that you go about your day
[50:15] the things you do the things you see the
[50:17] way you talk
[50:20] and when you start getting desperate for
[50:22] god
[50:23] tradition starts to matter less and less
[50:27] i don't care where i sit in the church i
[50:29] just want to be in church
[50:31] well brother i've sat in this church
[50:32] this chair here for 20 years
[50:36] i'm you know if you're you're
[50:37] comfortable that's between you and the
[50:39] lord but if you sit there and if you're
[50:40] offended if someone were to take your
[50:42] seat i challenge you friend that you
[50:44] might have a spirit that you don't want
[50:46] because that's that becomes a tradition
[50:49] this is the definition of my spiritual
[50:52] walk how can a seat in a building be the
[50:55] definition of your spiritual walk
[51:00] well this gets down to where we live
[51:02] doesn't it it's not to embarrass or
[51:03] shame anyone that's of course not the
[51:05] purpose here the purpose is to challenge
[51:08] us to challenge me where we live
[51:11] every day
[51:13] and what is the purpose
[51:15] well it's the challenges brother you
[51:16] just said it's to challenge us but it's
[51:18] to challenge us so that we are shaking a
[51:20] little bit so that we have a greater
[51:22] revelation of what we're supposed to be
[51:24] standing
[51:25] so that when the devil comes along and
[51:27] he says you're a fanatic
[51:32] anyone been called a fanatic
[51:37] oh yeah
[51:39] does that make you one
[51:41] no it doesn't
[51:43] maybe by the world's terminology but
[51:45] that's not what we're talking about here
[51:46] that's what we have by the grace of god
[51:48] we've got these little definitions today
[51:49] to help us understand the way that these
[51:52] have been applied
[51:56] fanaticism
[51:58] my emotion
[52:00] is my direction
[52:03] i've seen it off and on i've seen it in
[52:04] different people my entire life friends
[52:06] i was born and raised in a message my
[52:08] grandfather was a minister in the
[52:10] message my father is a minister in a
[52:12] message
[52:14] i've seen it off and on my entire life
[52:17] you've got two people doing exactly the
[52:18] same thing one is a fanatic and one is a
[52:21] saint of god following the leadership of
[52:23] the holy spirit
[52:24] doing the exact same thing
[52:27] well but brother tell me what to do i
[52:29] can't
[52:30] i can preach to you the truth i can
[52:32] preach to you where to stand but you
[52:34] need to follow the leadership of god
[52:37] [Music]
[52:38] grow in that seek god in it
[52:41] oh brother but how do i know let's let's
[52:43] continue here and we'll by the grace of
[52:45] god maybe this picture will come
[52:46] together for you
[52:48] the purpose of this today is to help you
[52:52] this is not to make you feel bad about
[52:53] where you may be at spiritually by no
[52:55] means
[52:57] i get so excited when i sit in a church
[52:59] service and i'm challenged i feel so
[53:01] grateful to god that god would have a
[53:03] consideration of me and he would preach
[53:05] to my condition where i'm at
[53:10] because i want to grow in the lord i
[53:12] don't want to stay where i am
[53:15] let's see this is in 1955
[53:19] enticing spirits now another thing that
[53:21] has taken place i believe and think that
[53:23] any man that's got an experience with
[53:24] god or a woman is bound to get a little
[53:26] emotional i just believe it
[53:29] that's right
[53:30] but you know what they've adopted
[53:33] emotionalism for the baptism of the holy
[53:36] ghost
[53:38] they've just got a lot of noise and
[53:40] there's nothing in it
[53:42] you live just as holy listen to this you
[53:45] live just as holy as you live noisy then
[53:48] you'll be all right
[53:52] emotions is certainly all right bodily
[53:54] exercise profit is little but enticing
[53:56] spirits has got all got over into the
[53:59] holiness group of people and they've got
[54:01] them just resting upon because they
[54:03] shout because they can dance because
[54:05] they can make a motion
[54:10] it started azusa street it's a move of
[54:12] god but this is in 1955 this is as the
[54:15] things are transitioning the pentecostal
[54:18] organization those that believe in the
[54:19] in azusa street experience
[54:22] they've heard the word they've heard it
[54:24] preached but their hearts are beginning
[54:26] to turn from god friends if you look at
[54:29] it and it's face value it looks the same
[54:32] but when you look from god's con god's
[54:34] perception
[54:36] one is godly and one is adultery
[54:40] they're not the same they're not even
[54:42] similar
[54:44] because one is beginning to worship the
[54:46] experience of emotion and as we said
[54:48] earlier the pentecostals went into to
[54:51] pursuing the gifts
[54:53] now
[54:54] they got so desperate to see the gifts
[54:56] in operation
[54:57] they didn't really care how they got
[54:59] there
[55:01] because if you don't have the gifts in
[55:03] operation openly in a service then
[55:05] you're not spiritual
[55:07] this is what they believe
[55:09] and friends it feels good
[55:13] it feels good to have the holy spirit
[55:14] move we'll get to this a little bit more
[55:16] in a bit it feels good to have the
[55:18] spirit moving in a service
[55:22] if he can can be good to just worship
[55:23] the lord and experience the blessings of
[55:25] god but that's what it is it's the
[55:26] blessings of god
[55:29] does that make it wrong
[55:31] it doesn't make it wrong that the
[55:32] blessings come and you you may scream
[55:34] and shout and and there's people that
[55:36] run the aisles it depends on the person
[55:38] some people jump up and down some people
[55:40] are quiet my mother hardly ever talks
[55:42] around people she's very introverted
[55:45] and you'll see her in a church service
[55:46] and she'll never do much more than
[55:48] she'll have her eyes closed and have her
[55:49] head down like this she's very reverent
[55:51] but i grew up hearing that woman pray
[55:54] all the time in her bedroom calling out
[55:56] to god
[55:58] and i felt
[56:00] more than i say we see feeling because
[56:02] there's brother branham even says as
[56:03] much we'll read this quote in a little
[56:04] bit there's times that we can't describe
[56:06] it it's like a feeling but it's more
[56:07] than a feeling it is a knowledge it's an
[56:10] absolute knowledge that there is the
[56:12] presence that is there with you by you
[56:14] next to you
[56:18] i grew up very familiar with that spirit
[56:21] the holy spirit being in our home
[56:24] i i grew up very familiar
[56:27] with people being genuine or being fake
[56:32] there's there's times when i've talked
[56:34] with many brothers about this but once
[56:36] you've seen the gen friends when you've
[56:37] seen the genuine you can't be convinced
[56:39] of something else
[56:41] when you've seen the real and someone
[56:43] else tries to give you something fake
[56:45] you compare the two by god's word and
[56:46] say that's not the genuine i've already
[56:49] seen it
[56:54] let's move along
[56:56] friends there are so many let's just
[56:58] pray that god helps us see
[57:00] the right picture today
[57:02] a beautiful simple holy righteous
[57:05] picture of god's balance
[57:09] live i just love that you live just as
[57:11] holy as you live noisy then you'll be
[57:13] all right my mother's not a loud person
[57:16] but it's one of the holiest women i've
[57:17] ever met
[57:18] emotions is certainly all right bodily
[57:20] exercise profited little but enticing
[57:22] experiences got over into the holiness
[57:24] group and they've got them just resting
[57:27] upon listen resting upon
[57:30] because they can shout
[57:32] because they can dance because they can
[57:35] make
[57:36] emotion
[57:38] but now let's jump to 1965.
[57:43] wait till that satisfaction comes and
[57:46] the satisfaction portion of the fullness
[57:49] of the holy spirit comes in then these
[57:51] joy bells of shouting and speaking in
[57:53] tongues and dancing in the spirit will
[57:55] come
[57:56] you won't have to listen you won't have
[57:58] to do it by music you won't have to you
[58:01] will do it when you're going down the
[58:02] road in the car you will do it when
[58:04] you're sweeping the floor you will do it
[58:06] when you're driving nails in the wall
[58:08] with your carpenter work wherever you go
[58:10] that that joy unspeakable and full of
[58:12] glory
[58:17] when you're in in the when the holy
[58:20] spirit is dealing with you personally
[58:22] you don't need an outside stimulation
[58:27] it's personal
[58:30] and this is this is such a
[58:32] this is such a thing because it's so
[58:34] open and and many people might might
[58:36] dance in church i'm not here to say
[58:37] right or wrong about dancing in church
[58:39] but let me just specify on this one
[58:41] thing
[58:42] friends
[58:43] do not try to say that it's dancing in
[58:45] the spirit if it's not dancing in the
[58:47] spirit
[58:50] if you have seen the genuine you will
[58:52] realize that dancing in the spirit has
[58:53] nothing to do with the music it has
[58:55] nothing to do with the world around that
[58:58] person
[59:00] they're shut off with
[59:02] god i saw a sister one time there was
[59:06] people were praying at the altar and i
[59:08] saw a woman spinning in circles with her
[59:10] hands in the air like this
[59:13] weaving in and out of the people with
[59:15] her eyes closed
[59:18] it wasn't moving to the music
[59:21] well brother
[59:22] does it mean that we all have to have
[59:23] that experience no absolutely not
[59:26] that's no evidence
[59:28] that itself is just that person
[59:31] experiencing the blessings of god and
[59:32] that may be fine as long as it's in
[59:34] order
[59:35] but friends we cannot package it up and
[59:37] say well we got the music going we've
[59:39] got this going and we've got that going
[59:41] and suddenly we're in the spirit don't
[59:43] call it this the holy spirit if it's not
[59:45] the holy spirit because when the holy
[59:47] spirit is moving you begin to move but
[59:50] you're not moving to the carnal world
[59:53] around you
[59:55] there is a spirit that is moving you you
[59:58] may cry you may shout you may run you
[1:00:00] may be quiet you may deal down you may
[1:00:03] do any number of things
[1:00:05] but it has nothing to do with anyone
[1:00:07] else
[1:00:10] it's personal
[1:00:12] no one else can take it from you
[1:00:14] and no one else can give it to you
[1:00:18] that's between you and god
[1:00:21] well brother i had this wonderful
[1:00:22] experience and i jumped and shouted
[1:00:24] praise the lord that's not evidence
[1:00:26] friend
[1:00:28] you might have a wonderful experience in
[1:00:30] the lord and that's the blessings of god
[1:00:32] that's not a bad thing
[1:00:35] but don't turn that into the evidence of
[1:00:37] a new birth
[1:00:39] it's not the same thing
[1:00:47] excuse me did we read this yes
[1:00:50] praise the lord
[1:00:52] 1959 the faith of abraham therefore that
[1:00:55] every person that's been born again of
[1:00:57] the holy spirit truly born not just
[1:00:59] thought they were born
[1:01:01] not went through some emotion but went
[1:01:03] through some not went through some
[1:01:05] sensation but truly born
[1:01:07] listen now they could have all the
[1:01:09] emotion sensation with it but you can
[1:01:12] have the sensation and emotion and not
[1:01:14] be born
[1:01:17] it's not evidence and it never was
[1:01:19] evidence
[1:01:21] that is what
[1:01:22] emotionalism
[1:01:25] as we have defined today
[1:01:27] that is what emotionalism
[1:01:29] is
[1:01:30] i am pursuing emotion as my objective
[1:01:34] well brother i would never do that
[1:01:37] the only way you know is to check with
[1:01:39] god
[1:01:41] well brother i
[1:01:43] you know
[1:01:44] us brothers we never cry do we
[1:01:47] no we would never do that how about get
[1:01:49] angry
[1:01:50] you ever get angry
[1:01:52] well maybe once in a while you got an
[1:01:54] emotion with that
[1:01:56] how about frustrated you got an emotion
[1:01:58] with that
[1:01:59] well brother yeah i'm not emotional oh
[1:02:01] sure you're not uh
[1:02:04] sure we think emotions
[1:02:07] i'm not mocking anything you understand
[1:02:08] what i'm saying
[1:02:10] oh
[1:02:10] oh brother i would never yes but you
[1:02:12] still have emotion
[1:02:14] you know why we have emotion because god
[1:02:16] made us that way
[1:02:20] but when satan comes along
[1:02:23] and he offers you something that looks
[1:02:26] like an experience with god
[1:02:29] but it's actually just emotion
[1:02:32] you just experienced a bait and switch
[1:02:39] well i wanted god
[1:02:41] but what i got was emotion
[1:02:43] well how do we know
[1:02:45] look at what it produces
[1:02:49] look at what it produced we just read in
[1:02:50] the beginning of service you you know
[1:02:52] paul does not go down these lines of
[1:02:54] saint paul does not go down these lines
[1:02:56] of thoughts accidentally
[1:03:00] he's looking at something spiritual and
[1:03:02] when we see the same thing spiritual
[1:03:03] that paul's looking at it makes a whole
[1:03:05] lot of sense
[1:03:06] paul's going down a line of thought and
[1:03:08] he's talking about straight is the gate
[1:03:10] narrow is excuse me this is not paul
[1:03:12] this is here in matthew
[1:03:14] there's a jesus speaking
[1:03:19] you should know them
[1:03:21] in verse number 14 because straight is
[1:03:23] the gate and narrow is the way which
[1:03:25] leadeth unto life he's saying it's not
[1:03:27] an easy thing to find
[1:03:32] and he says beware of false prophets
[1:03:36] they'll come in in this way
[1:03:37] they'll come in with a lot of emotion
[1:03:40] oh but brother i feel this must be god
[1:03:44] give it the word test
[1:03:46] right we've learned that haven't we can
[1:03:48] we say amen to that we've learned to
[1:03:49] give it the word test everything we do
[1:03:52] we give ourselves we give everything
[1:03:53] else give it the word test
[1:03:56] i i think that's god i think it is well
[1:03:59] brother i know when god speaks to me oh
[1:04:01] do you really
[1:04:03] how about when the prophet of god was
[1:04:04] flying and and god grounded his plane
[1:04:07] and he's standing there he's going down
[1:04:09] the street god is that you and there's a
[1:04:11] policeman on the other side he stops and
[1:04:12] he looks in the window and he's
[1:04:13] embarrassed because he's just wandering
[1:04:15] around and he's there he's praying he
[1:04:16] says lord is that you
[1:04:18] the prophet of god who's spoken to god
[1:04:20] many many many times he's saying lord is
[1:04:22] that you
[1:04:26] if he questioned himself why would we
[1:04:28] not
[1:04:30] why do you think he shared that
[1:04:31] testimony with us
[1:04:33] that we might make that moment and
[1:04:36] verify it lord is this you
[1:04:39] because if it's just emotion the
[1:04:41] destination is going to be a motion
[1:04:44] it's going to be a zeal it's going to be
[1:04:46] a passion it's going to be a pride of
[1:04:48] life
[1:04:50] yes i am going to achieve
[1:04:52] oh are you
[1:04:55] because if god chooses to have us fail
[1:04:56] we will fail
[1:04:59] but when we get to the point where i
[1:05:00] said lord i don't know what is up and
[1:05:01] what is down i don't know which way to
[1:05:04] go i want to be confident but lord i
[1:05:06] don't even know where to be confident
[1:05:07] but lord would you teach me
[1:05:10] he says oh
[1:05:12] my son my daughter
[1:05:13] i've just been waiting for you to ask
[1:05:17] and the lord teaches us you know when a
[1:05:19] child
[1:05:20] my son is now almost two years old and
[1:05:23] oh he can move really well
[1:05:26] and he goes just as running as fast as
[1:05:28] his little legs can take him across the
[1:05:29] yard all the other kids are gone and
[1:05:31] he's he's just you know his little legs
[1:05:33] are just going and going and he just
[1:05:35] goes full tilt
[1:05:38] but you know he doesn't always have good
[1:05:40] balance
[1:05:41] he also doesn't slow down
[1:05:44] he hasn't really learned that yet
[1:05:47] sometimes we do that as christians
[1:05:49] we run full tilt and before we know it
[1:05:52] we're bouncing off of this and we're
[1:05:54] bouncing off of that and here we all
[1:05:56] beat up well god why'd you do this to me
[1:05:58] and he says i didn't do that to you
[1:06:01] you said why were you wrong why would
[1:06:02] you get ahead of me
[1:06:04] why were you getting out there in front
[1:06:06] of the in front of the leadership of the
[1:06:07] holy spirit because you know a good wife
[1:06:10] is looking to her husband
[1:06:13] husband minister to me
[1:06:17] give me direction
[1:06:20] you know a good husband will give
[1:06:21] direction
[1:06:23] as we sit here today as men we may not
[1:06:25] always have the answers i know for a
[1:06:26] fact we don't always have the answers is
[1:06:28] that right brothers
[1:06:29] yes amen well what do we do when we
[1:06:31] don't have answers
[1:06:33] we know the one that does
[1:06:35] we have an obligation to our homes to
[1:06:37] lead our homes to have things in order
[1:06:39] and to not move by emotion
[1:06:43] we've been talking about being in
[1:06:44] service but what about all of life
[1:06:47] yes
[1:06:48] god told me to do this are you sure
[1:06:51] are you sure do you just feel it do you
[1:06:53] have a zeal do you have a pride of life
[1:06:55] that's moving you in a direction this
[1:06:57] has to happen
[1:06:59] or is it all just a
[1:07:01] inflative inflated bit of emotion
[1:07:04] but i feel it so strong brother
[1:07:07] but we've been taught to not go by
[1:07:09] emotion
[1:07:11] emotion is not
[1:07:12] wrong what we do with it
[1:07:15] can be wrong
[1:07:18] and sometimes people have looked at this
[1:07:20] well look at what look at what the
[1:07:21] pentecostals did you know they turned it
[1:07:23] into emotionalism and because they were
[1:07:24] they were chasing the gifts and they'll
[1:07:26] go through it by emotion and they'll
[1:07:27] have this and they'll have that and
[1:07:28] they'll pump up the music so i'm i don't
[1:07:31] even want the blessings of god
[1:07:33] we may not say it that way
[1:07:36] but we get so nervous about a move of
[1:07:38] god that we don't want to be fanatical
[1:07:40] because the world might cause fanatical
[1:07:42] and the the neighbors might call us
[1:07:44] fanatical and we say well i don't i
[1:07:46] don't want that brother that's
[1:07:47] fanaticism
[1:07:50] i would caution you this way friend
[1:07:54] as convoluted and as as chaotic and as
[1:07:57] corrupted as things have become in that
[1:07:59] way
[1:08:00] don't blaspheme the holy spirit
[1:08:06] because when the holy spirit comes
[1:08:09] you may have emotion
[1:08:12] emotion is not the evidence
[1:08:15] but if we get so afraid of a move of god
[1:08:18] because well
[1:08:20] that that picture of someone
[1:08:22] doing this or doing that we've put a
[1:08:24] definition on it and it becomes legalism
[1:08:28] don't do this don't do that because
[1:08:30] we're looking at the evil results of an
[1:08:33] emotional uh the pursuit of emotion
[1:08:35] emotionalism we're looking at the evil
[1:08:37] results results of that and there's some
[1:08:38] times where let's just let's just put
[1:08:40] this throughout the in the open there's
[1:08:42] some times where ministries have pushed
[1:08:43] on people for an emotional response
[1:08:48] we all know that this is true if you've
[1:08:49] been around for for some years you know
[1:08:51] that this is true
[1:08:54] but here we are today what is the
[1:08:56] correct thing
[1:08:58] what is a a proper balance how do we
[1:09:01] know that we can stand in confidence and
[1:09:03] when the holy spirit begins to move
[1:09:05] we're not afraid of things being out of
[1:09:07] order we're confidently moving with the
[1:09:09] spirit and when the spirit says go we go
[1:09:12] and when the spirit says stop we stop
[1:09:16] we are not pursuing emotion
[1:09:21] though emotion may be there
[1:09:24] emotion is not the objective
[1:09:27] but emotion may be there
[1:09:30] this is why this subject this topic has
[1:09:32] been so confusing
[1:09:34] has caused so many uh corrupted ideas
[1:09:39] of what a move of god
[1:09:41] is supposed to be
[1:09:45] but remember
[1:09:46] this is a bait and switch situation
[1:09:50] remember that if if the satan can't get
[1:09:52] you an emotionalism
[1:09:54] he'll try to get you on the other side
[1:09:57] he'll try to get you so cold and starchy
[1:10:00] because you're terrified of an emotional
[1:10:02] experience
[1:10:04] that you won't allow the blessings of
[1:10:07] god to soften your heart
[1:10:10] we had this wonderful little exercise i
[1:10:12] even even have shared this before but we
[1:10:14] were talking about bitterness with our
[1:10:15] young people and we had all the young
[1:10:17] people went outside and they were
[1:10:18] digging roots out of the yard this was
[1:10:20] their challenge he said you had to go
[1:10:21] outside find a weed and you have to pull
[1:10:23] out the entire the entire route and you
[1:10:26] can't come back inside until you've
[1:10:28] pulled out the entire route
[1:10:30] it was really hot that day
[1:10:32] really it was really nice and cool
[1:10:34] inside
[1:10:38] but you know we came back inside and it
[1:10:39] was a very frustrating experience
[1:10:42] because there were uh all of the of
[1:10:44] course all the young people were out
[1:10:46] there pulling up weeds and they would
[1:10:47] break off you know how it is you pull
[1:10:48] off a weed and it breaks off but they
[1:10:50] had to get the whole wheat the whole
[1:10:52] excuse me the whole root system
[1:10:54] and there was one little weed that was
[1:10:55] this tall
[1:10:57] and those roots were this long
[1:11:00] oh and they were just boy they were
[1:11:02] determined to get those roots out
[1:11:05] we came back inside and we're talking
[1:11:07] about the experience now we're talking
[1:11:08] about the root of bitterness
[1:11:11] and
[1:11:12] as we talk about the experience i said
[1:11:14] well how how could it be easier what
[1:11:16] would make this easier one of the young
[1:11:17] ladies there
[1:11:18] uh her father
[1:11:20] enjoys plants and now as a plant
[1:11:21] business
[1:11:22] and
[1:11:23] they have to help with weeding and with
[1:11:25] watering the the flowers and water
[1:11:27] taking care of the plants
[1:11:28] and she just made this comment she says
[1:11:30] well you just water it
[1:11:33] you water the ground and the roots come
[1:11:35] right out
[1:11:38] you see when the holy spirit begins to
[1:11:40] move
[1:11:41] it begins to soften your heart
[1:11:44] it begins to soften your condition so
[1:11:46] that the word can take hold can take
[1:11:49] root and begin to remove those things
[1:11:51] that should not be there
[1:11:53] but if we're so starchy and afraid of a
[1:11:55] move of the holy spirit that we're a
[1:11:57] real tight well i'm not i'm not a
[1:11:58] fanatic i'm not going to look like a
[1:12:00] fanatic i'm not even going over there
[1:12:01] i'm not doing anything we get so locked
[1:12:04] down
[1:12:05] that the holy spirit is not able to move
[1:12:08] within us and soften our hearts
[1:12:13] and when the holy spirit has softened
[1:12:15] our hearts and he begins to move you
[1:12:17] will find that god will begin to
[1:12:19] minister to you in that condition
[1:12:22] the holy spirit has now softened you
[1:12:24] softened your spirit softened all the
[1:12:26] hard things from life and the challenges
[1:12:29] of life and the trials that we're facing
[1:12:31] and the hard situations that we're
[1:12:32] facing and all the contradictions and
[1:12:34] confusion that is in the world and the
[1:12:36] holy spirit begins to soften your heart
[1:12:39] and then he begins to minister to your
[1:12:40] needs
[1:12:42] but if you don't allow him to soften
[1:12:44] your heart
[1:12:46] that condition just stays there
[1:12:49] and you go to pull it out and the the
[1:12:51] roots break off you praise the lord the
[1:12:53] lord deliver me and a year later you
[1:12:54] find that thing grows up again
[1:12:57] and you just go through the cycle over
[1:12:59] and over and over
[1:13:01] lord i need deliverance lord i need
[1:13:02] deliverance you have to fully submit to
[1:13:05] god allow god to just saturate your
[1:13:08] being
[1:13:09] and you stop caring what other people
[1:13:11] think and i don't mean being out of
[1:13:13] order and making a big show that's not
[1:13:14] what we're talking about we're just
[1:13:16] talking about so being so submitted to
[1:13:18] god that you say god whatever it takes
[1:13:22] there was something that was true there
[1:13:24] was something that was genuine about
[1:13:26] that azusa street experience they were
[1:13:29] so genuine they didn't know anything god
[1:13:32] was teaching them about the move of the
[1:13:34] spirit and they were just trying to to
[1:13:36] do everything they could to pursue god
[1:13:38] why had that changed
[1:13:42] why should that be different for us
[1:13:46] we're not talking about going with
[1:13:48] emotionalism
[1:13:50] we're talking about pursuing god with
[1:13:52] every part of our being
[1:13:55] not afraid of what god is going to do
[1:13:58] god will never harm you
[1:14:00] god will never hurt you and all of the
[1:14:02] hurts and woes that we have in our heart
[1:14:05] we just want to get to know god we want
[1:14:07] to be closer to god we'll touch on this
[1:14:08] more in just a moment let's move along
[1:14:14] this is from 1965 invisible union of the
[1:14:16] bride of christ
[1:14:17] the grace of god spoke to you brought
[1:14:19] you to the altar
[1:14:21] you're seeking god's blessing you're
[1:14:23] seeking his word you're seeking the holy
[1:14:24] ghost you're seeking the favors of god
[1:14:27] and you are and you can really with all
[1:14:29] your heart surrender it
[1:14:31] now don't look for any emotion look for
[1:14:33] truth a truth that's from your heart by
[1:14:36] faith lord i'm willing to do anything
[1:14:39] that your word commands me
[1:14:42] to do
[1:14:43] i surrender myself
[1:14:45] with all that's in me
[1:14:49] does it mean
[1:14:50] that that person won't have emotion
[1:14:53] no
[1:14:55] it means they're not pursuing emotion
[1:14:58] emotion is not even in the picture there
[1:15:01] or not there it doesn't matter
[1:15:05] see again let's go back to the
[1:15:06] pentecostal organization the gifts
[1:15:08] became the evidence
[1:15:11] and they're pursuing the gifts and to
[1:15:13] get there they went the emotional route
[1:15:17] but friends if if we're just
[1:15:19] i need to have this i need to have this
[1:15:21] and let me touch on this even for a
[1:15:23] moment
[1:15:25] and and this is this really hits home
[1:15:26] and we've got to say this very carefully
[1:15:28] and i pray that you you consider this
[1:15:30] with a spiritual mind
[1:15:33] do you know that we can get so caught up
[1:15:34] in trying to seek a new revelation
[1:15:38] well did our hearts not burn within us
[1:15:41] oh there's a stimulation inside we're
[1:15:43] after that feeling
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:47] but not looking for the word to actually
[1:15:49] have a result
[1:15:52] because the scripture says
[1:15:54] though i understand all mysteries and i
[1:15:56] have not love
[1:16:00] does it mean the mysteries are wrong
[1:16:02] of course not
[1:16:04] of course not
[1:16:07] but what you do with it
[1:16:12] if it be the true seed of god
[1:16:15] the true seed of god will bring up
[1:16:19] god
[1:16:20] it cannot produce anything else a good
[1:16:23] tree can only produce
[1:16:25] good
[1:16:27] brother i had this experience okay let's
[1:16:30] watch
[1:16:32] let's watch and see what happens
[1:16:35] brother i experience this great
[1:16:37] revelation praise the lord again we're
[1:16:39] speaking respectfully i've had this
[1:16:41] great revelation okay
[1:16:44] what does it produce in you
[1:16:48] you see
[1:16:49] if the devil can't get you on one side
[1:16:51] what is he going to do
[1:16:53] he's going to push you to the other
[1:16:56] well brother that's not emotionalism is
[1:16:58] it not
[1:16:59] we just want the stim we want the
[1:17:01] feeling of the stimulation of revelation
[1:17:03] we want something to be stimulating in
[1:17:04] us oh praise the lord but it's the
[1:17:06] feeling that we're after
[1:17:10] oh my
[1:17:13] so close it would deceive the very elect
[1:17:17] if it were possible
[1:17:20] now we know let me let me just caveat
[1:17:22] that a little bit
[1:17:24] we know that revelation comes from the
[1:17:25] lord is that right
[1:17:26] and god is giving he's opening those
[1:17:28] things
[1:17:29] to his children
[1:17:31] and that's exclusively
[1:17:32] for his children
[1:17:35] but someone can look at those things and
[1:17:37] they start putting the pieces together
[1:17:38] i've got all the facts i've got the
[1:17:40] facts i've got the facts oh yeah look at
[1:17:41] this and then this goes with this and
[1:17:43] this
[1:17:44] and it's stimulating me on the inside
[1:17:47] and i'm gonna i'm addicted
[1:17:50] to that stimulation
[1:17:52] that's emotionalism just like everything
[1:17:54] else
[1:17:56] it is christ in you
[1:17:59] this is the mystery that god is looking
[1:18:01] for the revelation of himself in you the
[1:18:04] ma what is the interpretation of god's
[1:18:06] word the manifestation of god's word
[1:18:09] how is god's word interpreted living
[1:18:13] in
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:17] not from here
[1:18:18] and not because my heart is warm and
[1:18:20] because i enjoy the service
[1:18:22] that's good that's not wrong but that's
[1:18:24] not the evidence
[1:18:27] praise the lord
[1:18:33] 1958 called out i wish now
[1:18:36] let's
[1:18:38] this is this is a good example to
[1:18:39] distinguish brother branham is
[1:18:41] explaining this here distinguishing
[1:18:43] between the blessings of god and the
[1:18:45] power of god this is a whole subject in
[1:18:47] itself which we're not going to spend a
[1:18:48] lot of time on but let's hear what the
[1:18:50] prophet says about this in 1958 the cold
[1:18:53] out i just wish i had some vocabulary to
[1:18:56] explain this this just now
[1:18:58] there's nothing can do it he can't
[1:19:00] explain it
[1:19:01] you know what it feels like
[1:19:04] every person in here under my control
[1:19:06] that's right the holy spirit is here the
[1:19:09] anointing
[1:19:11] it doesn't make me jump up and scream
[1:19:14] that's the blessings of god
[1:19:18] isn't that an incredible distinction
[1:19:21] he's saying i'm having this reaction but
[1:19:23] there is something else there is a
[1:19:25] different experience
[1:19:28] let's see as he continues
[1:19:29] a lot of times you pentecostal people
[1:19:31] gets fooled by that
[1:19:34] jesus had the greatest anointing of any
[1:19:37] man
[1:19:38] he read a scripture as i just read it
[1:19:40] now and he said this day the scripture
[1:19:42] is fulfilled in your eyes and what did
[1:19:44] he do he read the scripture and never
[1:19:46] run all over the place he sat down
[1:19:49] a precious and precious words come from
[1:19:51] his mouth the greatest anointing that
[1:19:53] had ever anointed because the scripture
[1:19:55] had said i've put my spirit upon him to
[1:19:57] sow judgment to heal the sick and so
[1:19:59] forth he said
[1:20:04] that's the blessings of your salvation
[1:20:07] that you're enjoying there
[1:20:09] the blessings
[1:20:11] not the power the spirit
[1:20:18] it's something to chew on isn't it
[1:20:20] i don't know about you but i want to
[1:20:21] understand every moment where i'm
[1:20:23] standing
[1:20:24] lord what do you want me to do now
[1:20:27] right right now
[1:20:28] i don't mean vaguely i don't mean some
[1:20:30] distant interpretation of it i mean in
[1:20:32] this moment right now what am i supposed
[1:20:34] to be doing that's pleasing to the
[1:20:35] father this moment right now
[1:20:38] this is brother branham expressing in
[1:20:40] this moment there is something different
[1:20:42] but this is not that
[1:20:44] there is a power that is here there's
[1:20:46] something that needs to happen and he's
[1:20:49] expressing that there is a difference
[1:20:52] does it make the blessings wrong
[1:21:00] what a great question
[1:21:03] because now we have to start figuring
[1:21:04] out
[1:21:05] where do we stand
[1:21:07] well
[1:21:08] he clearly says that you're looking for
[1:21:10] the power of god and it's easy to
[1:21:12] interpret that and say well you know the
[1:21:14] blessing's over here we're just looking
[1:21:15] for the power of god but remember that
[1:21:17] scenario of the rain falling
[1:21:20] falling on the earth
[1:21:22] it's softening our hearts
[1:21:24] and we've taken the blessing with god
[1:21:26] and set them off on the side and we
[1:21:27] can't figure out how we've lost the joy
[1:21:29] of our salvation
[1:21:31] we can't figure out how how we're always
[1:21:34] excuse me
[1:21:36] but our mind is just maxed out we feel
[1:21:38] like our mind is being ripped apart and
[1:21:40] we feel like the stress is just
[1:21:41] overwhelming we can't figure out
[1:21:45] why we're all worn out
[1:21:50] but when those blessings come
[1:21:52] god says
[1:21:54] you come through a trial you come
[1:21:55] through the the situation you need to
[1:21:57] come through spend a little time and in
[1:21:59] some blessings and worship god
[1:22:02] don't chase emotion
[1:22:05] but enjoy the blessings
[1:22:07] it's a gift from god
[1:22:08] we i love this scenario we have um
[1:22:12] i believe it was rebecca
[1:22:15] she's uh
[1:22:18] receives the the rebecca and isaac
[1:22:22] she receives the the gifts from the come
[1:22:24] from abraham comes through eliezer
[1:22:27] she gets the gifts i've probably used
[1:22:29] this example before but it's a wonderful
[1:22:30] scenario
[1:22:32] because
[1:22:33] abraham had sent some blessings for her
[1:22:37] and the gifts are given the bracelets
[1:22:39] and so on are given to rebecca
[1:22:41] and
[1:22:43] she's enjoying the wow this is this is
[1:22:45] impressive these gifts are impressive
[1:22:49] you know she she was spent the time on
[1:22:51] the camels and they're traveling and
[1:22:53] they get to where they're going or they
[1:22:54] almost get to where they're going and
[1:22:55] their she's been talking with eliezer
[1:22:57] eliza what's what's the master like
[1:22:59] who's this who's that what is this like
[1:23:00] what color does he like what does he
[1:23:02] like about this what do you like about
[1:23:03] that
[1:23:04] you know when she arrives and she sees
[1:23:06] isaac out there in the field she doesn't
[1:23:08] take off all of the gifts that she'd
[1:23:09] received and throw him on the ground and
[1:23:10] stomp on him
[1:23:14] they were they were little tokens of of
[1:23:15] the love of the father
[1:23:18] they had been given to her as a special
[1:23:19] thing
[1:23:21] and she didn't throw him down but she
[1:23:22] also didn't stop and say isaac i don't
[1:23:25] really need you i've got the gifts
[1:23:31] that's the difference
[1:23:34] the the they were a gift from the one
[1:23:36] she loved from the father
[1:23:38] indicating the the commitment of the son
[1:23:42] but she didn't throw them down and stomp
[1:23:43] on them and spit on them
[1:23:46] they were just they were just a part of
[1:23:47] the picture
[1:23:49] they had become a part of who she was
[1:23:50] she wasn't focused on that but it was
[1:23:52] still part of who she was
[1:23:56] i love to use this example and again may
[1:23:57] have used this example i've been saying
[1:23:58] this a lot today but these are things
[1:24:00] that have been in my heart for a very
[1:24:01] long time
[1:24:03] in general this is such a confusing
[1:24:04] topic and by the grace of god again
[1:24:06] today the lord just give us a little
[1:24:08] clarity
[1:24:09] but all of these things that
[1:24:11] people may come into the presence of god
[1:24:13] enjoy the blessings of the lord
[1:24:15] but you know
[1:24:17] i have two sons and they both have blue
[1:24:19] eyes
[1:24:21] all of my sons have blue eyes
[1:24:24] but not everyone with blue eyes is my
[1:24:26] son
[1:24:29] my sons have blue eyes but not everyone
[1:24:31] with blue eyes is my son
[1:24:34] all of god's children
[1:24:36] have the blessings of god
[1:24:38] but not everyone with the blessings is a
[1:24:40] child of god
[1:24:43] they might come so far but this is what
[1:24:45] the pentecostals as an organization have
[1:24:47] done
[1:24:48] they came so far and when the word came
[1:24:50] to them we know what the story is they
[1:24:52] came so far and they chose the gifts
[1:24:55] over
[1:24:57] a further move of god
[1:25:00] they choose chose the gifts over the
[1:25:02] opening of the word they didn't want to
[1:25:03] go further with god they come so far and
[1:25:05] they don't want to go any further does
[1:25:07] that make sense friends
[1:25:13] let's move along quickly here time's
[1:25:15] getting away from us
[1:25:18] 1965 the invisible union of the bride of
[1:25:20] christ
[1:25:21] the grace of god spoke to you brought
[1:25:23] you to the altar
[1:25:29] let's turn to matthew 6 if you would
[1:25:32] we're going to
[1:25:33] change the direction here for just a few
[1:25:35] minutes
[1:25:38] by the grace of god i don't want to keep
[1:25:39] you much longer
[1:25:50] praise the lord
[1:25:56] god is so wonderful
[1:25:58] in the times where we're
[1:26:00] going through such challenges
[1:26:03] the lord always has an answer
[1:26:06] has a way to comfort his people
[1:26:11] matthew 6 let's read just verses 5 and
[1:26:13] 8.
[1:26:17] as you saw the title of their thoughts
[1:26:19] today is a secret closet and
[1:26:21] understanding emotion
[1:26:24] so here in matthew 6 let's read verses
[1:26:27] 5 and 8.
[1:26:29] and when thou prayest thou shalt not be
[1:26:31] as the hypocrites are for they love to
[1:26:33] pray and pray standing in the synagogues
[1:26:35] and in the corners of the streets
[1:26:37] that they may be seen of men
[1:26:40] verily i say unto you they have their
[1:26:42] reward
[1:26:44] but thou when thou prayest enter into
[1:26:45] thy closet and when thou hast shut thy
[1:26:48] door pray to thy father which is in
[1:26:50] secret
[1:26:51] and thy father which sheth in secret
[1:26:53] shall reward thee openly
[1:26:57] now we're going to
[1:26:59] by the grace of god tie this in with uh
[1:27:02] this is here in 1963 now in the seventh
[1:27:05] seal
[1:27:06] there is
[1:27:07] a vision of course that brother branham
[1:27:09] is referring to here and we're just
[1:27:10] going to catch a snippet of it and then
[1:27:11] we're going to go back to where he
[1:27:12] explains a little bit more
[1:27:14] but here in the seventh seal he's
[1:27:15] talking about
[1:27:17] and just when he picked me up he took me
[1:27:18] up and sent me way up high
[1:27:21] to where a meeting was going on
[1:27:23] looked like a tent or the cathedral of
[1:27:25] some sort and i looked and there was a
[1:27:26] little box like a little place over in
[1:27:29] the side
[1:27:30] and i seen that light was talking to
[1:27:31] somebody above me that light that you
[1:27:34] see here there on the picture
[1:27:36] it whirled away from me like that and
[1:27:38] went over to that tent and said
[1:27:41] i'll meet you in there
[1:27:42] and said
[1:27:44] this will be the third pool
[1:27:46] and you won't tell it to nobody
[1:27:53] now let's read here in 1956 he's
[1:27:55] expounding on what this vision was a
[1:27:58] little bit more 1956 being led of the
[1:28:02] holy spirit
[1:28:03] exactly what we're referring to today
[1:28:06] and just then now i want you to watch
[1:28:08] this and listen how it is now
[1:28:10] so you watched the difference then i
[1:28:12] heard something whipping around where
[1:28:14] were
[1:28:15] like that was that always goes every
[1:28:17] time we have a healing service that just
[1:28:19] what happens that's just what happens
[1:28:22] that's the way it has always sounded
[1:28:24] sounded that way in the bush that time
[1:28:25] when i heard it it's always been that
[1:28:27] way and i felt it and i heard it rather
[1:28:31] going moving and i looked and here went
[1:28:33] that real soft light moving
[1:28:36] away from me and went down and went into
[1:28:38] that little building
[1:28:42] and then there's something different
[1:28:44] between the light and the angel
[1:28:46] because he's still here with me and the
[1:28:48] light had went
[1:28:49] into the building
[1:28:51] and this angel still speaking behind me
[1:28:53] which is a big man he said i will meet
[1:28:54] you in there.
[1:28:57] so then i said i don't understand why in
[1:28:59] there and he said watch
[1:29:02] and this woman went when she come out of
[1:29:04] there on the ambulance stretcher she was
[1:29:06] pushing the stretcher out the other side
[1:29:12] and she said the lady asked her she said
[1:29:15] what what happened she said i don't know
[1:29:17] it just happened she said i've been in
[1:29:19] the stretcher said i've been down in the
[1:29:21] bed for years and here come the man out
[1:29:23] packing his crutches and they asked him
[1:29:26] what said he didn't know
[1:29:27] and he was coming to the platform to
[1:29:29] testify and i said i don't understand
[1:29:32] that in there
[1:29:35] and watch he always he's always
[1:29:38] scriptural
[1:29:39] he said did not our lord say when thou
[1:29:41] prayest be not like the hypocrites that
[1:29:44] like to make a show
[1:29:47] and said
[1:29:48] enter into the secret closet and when
[1:29:51] you've done so
[1:29:52] close
[1:29:53] the door
[1:29:55] then pray to the father that seeth in
[1:29:58] secret
[1:29:59] and he that seeth in secret shall reward
[1:30:02] thee
[1:30:02] openly
[1:30:06] and he said remember that name that you
[1:30:08] were hunting that time you were dreamed
[1:30:10] about you were dreamed about i said yes
[1:30:12] he said i'll meet you in there this time
[1:30:15] it won't be a public show
[1:30:17] and the vision left me
[1:30:21] this scenario
[1:30:24] again we could spend much time on just
[1:30:26] this portion here but we want to tie it
[1:30:28] by the grace of god with
[1:30:30] what we are considering today
[1:30:32] and the reason why these two parts come
[1:30:34] together is because
[1:30:38] there is a secret place
[1:30:40] that god is calling us to
[1:30:44] and the devil wants you to believe that
[1:30:46] you're in that secret place
[1:30:49] when you're not
[1:30:52] the devil wants to
[1:30:53] convince you
[1:30:55] with emotion
[1:30:57] with legalism
[1:30:59] with pentecostalism
[1:31:01] satan wants to put everything in front
[1:31:04] of you and try to get your attention
[1:31:06] on something that will make you think
[1:31:10] that you're already
[1:31:13] in a secret place with god
[1:31:18] and for even friends if we've been there
[1:31:21] many times praying with the lord
[1:31:24] just between you and god
[1:31:26] no matter how many times you've been
[1:31:28] there there's times where we become
[1:31:30] complacent
[1:31:32] we become a little bit tired we become
[1:31:34] so busy with life as we were just
[1:31:35] talking about a moment ago your mind
[1:31:37] just feels like it's being ripped apart
[1:31:42] and as we look at this situation but the
[1:31:44] brandon has this has the visions relay
[1:31:46] it now now and the seven seal he says
[1:31:47] this is the third pool
[1:31:50] there's something profound here for us
[1:31:53] there's something that he's highlighting
[1:31:54] here in this one of this the most
[1:31:56] fantastic messages has ever been
[1:31:58] preached
[1:31:59] the seventh seal
[1:32:02] there's something that's happening
[1:32:05] and leading all the way up through azusa
[1:32:06] street all through the 1950s brother
[1:32:08] bannon is watching the divergence
[1:32:12] the separation of the move of god from
[1:32:13] the people
[1:32:15] and the people most of the people the
[1:32:16] pentecostals have chased off after this
[1:32:19] evidence and that evidence
[1:32:21] and people that thought they were were
[1:32:22] sincere they they chased after this
[1:32:25] doctrine and they chased after this
[1:32:26] doctrine
[1:32:29] there were some that chased after
[1:32:30] brother branham himself and they tried
[1:32:32] to worship brother branham
[1:32:35] and then they've had this doctrine about
[1:32:37] brother branham and had that doctrine
[1:32:38] about brother branham and and the
[1:32:40] summation of it many times becomes look
[1:32:42] at me i have this exclusive revelation
[1:32:44] that no one else has
[1:32:48] i'm exclusive
[1:32:50] and if you're not in my group you're out
[1:32:57] it's happened
[1:32:58] over the years
[1:33:02] but if we as god's children want to
[1:33:04] stand at the very end of time
[1:33:07] and say lord we have not deviated to the
[1:33:09] left we've not deviated to the right
[1:33:11] lord we've stayed right in tune with you
[1:33:14] so perfectly aligned
[1:33:16] that when you speak we hear you
[1:33:18] we're not caught by some glamour some by
[1:33:20] some glitz of of this great experience
[1:33:23] that makes us feel good even if it feels
[1:33:25] worse
[1:33:26] we're willing to take god's word
[1:33:30] do you know many times that god will
[1:33:31] permit that to be so
[1:33:34] you've got two choices and one is a
[1:33:36] harder thing oh that's really hard in
[1:33:37] the flesh i don't want to go that route
[1:33:39] but you have to give it up
[1:33:43] my mind goes back to watching my when my
[1:33:45] son was two and a half months old was
[1:33:47] was
[1:33:48] dying of rsv and bacterial pneumonia
[1:33:52] both of his lungs have had collapsed
[1:33:54] part way and he's only two and a half
[1:33:56] months old this very small little
[1:33:57] package
[1:34:00] and my wife and i have to after being
[1:34:01] there we prayed together and said lord
[1:34:03] when he was born we committed him into
[1:34:05] your hands and we will not take him back
[1:34:07] now
[1:34:08] this was our commitment to the lord
[1:34:10] you see when you get to the point where
[1:34:12] you're willing to put everything in
[1:34:13] god's hands and it's it is it does not
[1:34:16] matter what you feel like it does not
[1:34:18] matter what the situation looks like
[1:34:20] lord i will take your word no matter
[1:34:22] what the conditions are speaking to me
[1:34:24] no matter what everyone else is saying i
[1:34:27] don't care if they call me a fanatic i
[1:34:29] am not a fanatic
[1:34:32] i am not chasing my emotions my
[1:34:34] destination is not emotion i am not cold
[1:34:38] i am not starchy and when god calls on
[1:34:41] me to get shut in with him i am not
[1:34:44] going to accept anything
[1:34:47] that then genuine
[1:34:50] fellowship with him
[1:34:52] i won't take some bait and switch
[1:34:55] i won't take some false simulation some
[1:34:58] emulation of who i know god is
[1:35:04] and the age that we live in pulling
[1:35:06] every every direction
[1:35:08] to the left to the right up down
[1:35:11] you know that overshooting the target is
[1:35:13] just as bad as undershooting the target
[1:35:16] oh i'm gonna do this great thing for god
[1:35:18] god didn't ask you to he just asked you
[1:35:20] to do his word he said do exactly as i
[1:35:23] tell you and you'll hit the mark every
[1:35:26] time obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:35:30] just hit the mark that's where we want
[1:35:32] to be
[1:35:35] and god calls us
[1:35:37] he says come
[1:35:38] well brother i thought this is a natural
[1:35:40] secret place it should be
[1:35:43] we should have a natural place where we
[1:35:45] just go and shut the door
[1:35:47] but friends there is something even
[1:35:49] deeper than a natural a room a little
[1:35:51] closet where you go pray brother branham
[1:35:53] always set the example for us to go pray
[1:35:56] in secret physically in secret
[1:35:58] physically separate yourself
[1:36:02] but you can do that
[1:36:04] and knock it shut in with
[1:36:08] god it takes
[1:36:11] laying down
[1:36:13] everything
[1:36:15] well brother what do you mean everything
[1:36:17] i mean our hurts
[1:36:18] our sorrows
[1:36:20] our confusion
[1:36:22] our anger
[1:36:23] our desire to achieve
[1:36:28] everything
[1:36:30] and when the holy spirit begins to move
[1:36:33] we're not looking at some false evidence
[1:36:36] it's not the
[1:36:38] addition of emotion or lack of emotion
[1:36:41] that's nothing
[1:36:43] i may cry i may not cry what difference
[1:36:45] does that make
[1:36:47] i might be in the blessings of god i
[1:36:49] might scream at my child what difference
[1:36:50] does that make
[1:36:52] what i'm looking for is to be in his
[1:36:54] will i want to be so perfectly in his
[1:36:57] will that when someone calls me a
[1:36:59] fanatic i can confidently stand there
[1:37:01] and say
[1:37:02] i'm sorry you see it that way
[1:37:05] i don't have to rise up and defend
[1:37:06] myself and challenge that person i don't
[1:37:08] need to push on them i know where i'm
[1:37:11] standing and i can pray in love for them
[1:37:14] because the ground is soft it's been
[1:37:16] saturated with the holy spirit brother
[1:37:19] i've got hurts i've got anger then you
[1:37:21] need to get in the presence of god and
[1:37:23] stay there
[1:37:30] so many different ideas
[1:37:33] we can preach about this we can talk
[1:37:34] about it but it takes god to make it
[1:37:37] personal to you
[1:37:38] when you have a revelation of what it
[1:37:40] means to get shut in with god you watch
[1:37:42] the things in your life change
[1:37:46] because you're taking the word the word
[1:37:48] is the seed of god you're taking the
[1:37:50] seed of god and you're planting it in
[1:37:52] good ground you're watering the good
[1:37:55] ground spending time in the holy spirit
[1:37:57] and that seed continues to grow
[1:38:00] well lord i'm weak in this area let me
[1:38:01] go let me go uh i'm going to pray i'm
[1:38:03] going to go to church i'm going to see
[1:38:05] what brother chad is going to preach on
[1:38:06] sunday and my aunt my questions are
[1:38:08] going to be answered
[1:38:10] you come to church and you come with
[1:38:11] that attitude and the minister preaches
[1:38:14] and you get a strength in your heart now
[1:38:16] you have to go saturate in it
[1:38:19] it's not just one moment the church
[1:38:21] service is not the pinnacle of your week
[1:38:25] we're taking the word that we receive we
[1:38:27] want to take it home we want to apply it
[1:38:29] we want to live in it
[1:38:32] we want to saturate in it allow the holy
[1:38:35] spirit to move through you and move you
[1:38:37] in whatsoever direction he wills
[1:38:42] and satan will love
[1:38:44] to give you some false idea
[1:38:49] because if he gives you a false
[1:38:52] then you miss the genuine
[1:38:55] if he can convince you that you've
[1:38:57] already received something that you
[1:38:58] haven't
[1:39:00] you miss the genuine
[1:39:04] and friends as children of god we have
[1:39:06] been robbed
[1:39:07] many times
[1:39:10] by many false ideas that have come our
[1:39:11] way and i'm not talking about any
[1:39:13] particular person i mean this is the
[1:39:15] strategy of satan
[1:39:17] he's trying to give you something to
[1:39:19] push your attention to the left or right
[1:39:22] and sometimes the ground in us gets so
[1:39:25] we've been walking with the lord this
[1:39:26] doesn't make you not a son or daughter
[1:39:27] of god
[1:39:29] sometimes that god has done a tremendous
[1:39:31] work he might be a born again son or
[1:39:32] daughter of god but you get so buried
[1:39:34] that bored down with with life and with
[1:39:36] things that are just pressing on you you
[1:39:38] have to we have to be reminded to get in
[1:39:41] his presence to just be enjoy being in
[1:39:43] love with him
[1:39:45] enjoy the sweetness the tenderness the
[1:39:47] innocence of being in the presence of
[1:39:49] the holy spirit
[1:39:53] and when we get in that place
[1:39:55] we begin to commune with him
[1:39:58] he doesn't stay silent
[1:40:01] he begins to speak
[1:40:03] do you brother you know as an audible
[1:40:05] voice is it this is it that i don't know
[1:40:07] for you
[1:40:08] i don't know how god will deal with you
[1:40:10] that's between you and god
[1:40:13] we want a formula we want well is it
[1:40:14] going to have no no no no
[1:40:16] you personally
[1:40:19] get to know god
[1:40:21] brother why would we why would we take
[1:40:23] the time to emphasize this
[1:40:26] do you know that there are young people
[1:40:28] that are growing up here in this
[1:40:29] assembly
[1:40:30] that were not alive when brother branham
[1:40:32] was alive
[1:40:34] they don't remember the testimonies of
[1:40:36] azusa street
[1:40:38] there are many situations that we're
[1:40:40] growing up in we have not seen enough of
[1:40:43] the genuine
[1:40:45] this is not a criticism of anyone or
[1:40:47] certainly not of the assembly here or
[1:40:49] anything that of that effect this is
[1:40:51] what satan is trying to do in the age
[1:40:53] we're living in he's trying to give a
[1:40:55] false he's trying to get detention away
[1:40:57] from the genuine and when you're
[1:40:58] saturated like a sponge absorbing the
[1:41:00] holy spirit every day and the word is
[1:41:03] being preached it begins to blossom
[1:41:06] supernatural as a wonderful brother has
[1:41:08] said the supernatural is just natural
[1:41:11] it's just an attribute
[1:41:14] but we can take all the facts we can
[1:41:16] take all the scriptures
[1:41:18] and take all the facts and try to put it
[1:41:20] together
[1:41:21] and just hammer it and hammer and hammer
[1:41:23] it you know what we'll get
[1:41:24] nothing
[1:41:27] it's god's word
[1:41:29] he knows how to use it
[1:41:32] the holy spirit has been given to
[1:41:35] lead
[1:41:36] and guide us
[1:41:37] in all truth and righteousness
[1:41:44] let's summarize in this way
[1:41:47] from 1963 god hiding himself in
[1:41:49] simplicity
[1:41:52] there is one side that's highly
[1:41:53] intellectual cold and indifferent they
[1:41:55] deny everything there and the other
[1:41:57] sides get on the excuse me and the
[1:41:59] others get on the other side
[1:42:01] on the other side with a radical bunch
[1:42:03] of emotion and deny the word
[1:42:09] but that real true church
[1:42:11] stays right in the middle of the road
[1:42:14] now if you notice
[1:42:15] it's got the bible knowledge of what god
[1:42:17] said
[1:42:18] it's spiritual enough to be warm in its
[1:42:21] heart
[1:42:22] and it's just the road
[1:42:26] isaiah said it would be that way he said
[1:42:28] there will be a highway
[1:42:34] today friend
[1:42:36] what i see so clearly is that
[1:42:39] satan has presented so many false things
[1:42:41] to try to rob us
[1:42:43] of our blessings
[1:42:44] of the power of god
[1:42:46] of everything that god has for us
[1:42:50] but every word
[1:42:51] is ours
[1:42:53] not just the ones that we're
[1:42:54] uncomfortable with not just the ones
[1:42:56] that we don't understand
[1:42:58] all of it
[1:42:59] and there are times when brother branham
[1:43:00] starts talking about spiritual things i
[1:43:02] say brother branham i have never
[1:43:04] experienced that i don't know what
[1:43:05] you're saying
[1:43:07] but if if it's for me to understand god
[1:43:10] can minister to me
[1:43:11] to understand those things
[1:43:15] it's it's no it's no mystery to god when
[1:43:17] god wants to make it simple to you god
[1:43:18] makes it simple to you
[1:43:21] so what is our
[1:43:23] what is the heart of what we are looking
[1:43:25] at today
[1:43:26] the heart of what we are looking at
[1:43:28] today
[1:43:30] let's see if we we can back up to our
[1:43:33] take me just a moment here to back up to
[1:43:34] our
[1:43:35] a little summary slide of our
[1:43:37] definitions
[1:43:39] legalism
[1:43:41] living a law instead of grace
[1:43:43] pentecostalism pursuing gifts as the
[1:43:46] objective
[1:43:47] emotionalism pursuing emotion as the
[1:43:50] objective
[1:43:51] fanaticism my emotion
[1:43:53] is my direction
[1:43:55] and a bait and switch
[1:43:58] sold one thing but receiving another
[1:44:05] in this moment
[1:44:10] this is the thoughts for today
[1:44:13] let's go back to what we're considering
[1:44:15] at the beginning of service brother
[1:44:16] branham would discern the hearts and
[1:44:18] there would be this tremendous move of
[1:44:20] god what do we expect now at the end of
[1:44:22] a service
[1:44:25] it's easy to be nervous and try to
[1:44:26] emulate what brother branham did or what
[1:44:28] someone else does
[1:44:30] but see now we have to apply the very
[1:44:32] things that we've just been talking
[1:44:34] about
[1:44:35] what is it the thing that we're after
[1:44:37] the thing that we're after is that god's
[1:44:39] word be known
[1:44:40] that god's word the holy spirit might be
[1:44:43] able to saturate your being
[1:44:46] with freedom that you might not be
[1:44:49] afraid of being in the presence of god
[1:44:52] we've had so many wounds and and mis
[1:44:54] misguided ideas about what is the
[1:44:57] presence of god and what is the evidence
[1:44:58] of the holy ghost and all of these
[1:45:00] things over the years
[1:45:04] but god has so many blessings and
[1:45:06] richness for his children
[1:45:10] there is no need for us to take an
[1:45:12] imitation
[1:45:14] there's no need for us to take
[1:45:17] some other idea
[1:45:23] so we'll ask you this let's just stand
[1:45:24] together
[1:45:26] just so you're not nervous i'm not
[1:45:27] making a big altar call or or pulling on
[1:45:30] you for something special
[1:45:33] we're not doing that today
[1:45:38] but we now have an opportunity
[1:45:41] it's just you and god
[1:45:44] see the minister ministers
[1:45:46] will do everything that is in our heart
[1:45:48] to do to be able to encourage the saints
[1:45:49] of god
[1:45:51] but i also have been fellowshipping
[1:45:52] recently and brother jeremy and i were
[1:45:54] talking last night
[1:45:56] one plants one waters
[1:45:59] but god gives the increase
[1:46:02] no man can make you
[1:46:04] any different than what you are
[1:46:07] that's between you and god it's
[1:46:08] sovereign between you and
[1:46:10] god and that's just something for you
[1:46:14] to work out with the lord
[1:46:16] so what we're going to do now is just
[1:46:18] invite the musicians to come we're just
[1:46:19] going to worship the lord for a few
[1:46:20] minutes
[1:46:22] and then by the grace of god we're going
[1:46:24] to go home
[1:46:27] but if there's been anything here today
[1:46:29] in the content
[1:46:30] that we have looked at
[1:46:33] i encourage you if you have been
[1:46:35] challenged in your heart if you
[1:46:37] find that there's some
[1:46:38] things that have just been hanging in
[1:46:39] your heart you haven't been able to
[1:46:41] praise god and serve god and maybe
[1:46:43] there's a hang-up in your heart
[1:46:45] it's a good opportunity to just
[1:46:47] seek the lord
[1:46:49] you see sometimes when we're together
[1:46:50] we're all praying in the same direction
[1:46:52] we're not looking for an emotional
[1:46:54] output
[1:46:55] we're not looking for an emotional
[1:46:56] result
[1:46:58] we just want the holy spirit to have his
[1:47:00] way
[1:47:00] in sweetness
[1:47:03] and we can take that presence with us as
[1:47:05] we go home
[1:47:08] we want the lord to have his way from
[1:47:10] beginning to end
[1:47:13] can anyone say amen to that
[1:47:16] can we
[1:47:17] sing that song by his word
[1:47:19] i'll prevail by his word i'll never fail
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:36] oh
[1:47:37] i'm
[1:47:39] breathing
