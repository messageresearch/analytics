TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now we're back in the uh it is the rising of the Sun he says remember he went there with you and him see God never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body that's why we don't go to judgment this is the reason we do not go to condemnation we do not go to judgment there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus why because I was in Christ Jesus there he made me pay for my sins there I you know say your brother Chad comprehend that explain that to me I can but I believe it friends I can't explain that to you but it's the truth so he says now he says he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride all of a sudden this changes things the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the Bride was that true in Adam's day when God said to Adam multiply and replenish the Earth that same word spoke to the bride when he gave them word and says don't don't partake of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil when he says that did that also apply to the bride yes sir so the word that applies to the groom also applies to the bride praise God now this just opened up the whole Bible that understanding just opened up the whole Bible because now what what verses apply to the bride let's find the bride's verses you'll find the brides verses coupled in the Grooms verses because what he spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride [Music] is it the same word spoke of the group speaks of the brine well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride I'm going to read that again so that it can hit home pay close attention how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised to him why because the scriptures that pertain to him pertain to her also the work that I do you'll do also right so how can the Bride come and not manifest everything that was promised of him and how and the groom come do we believe in the coming of the Lord do we believe the groom come the bridegroom is descended so he says now he's going to tell you what to look for and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride so when the groom comes what is the groom he's the bride where's the groom in the bride what form is he in he's in the formation of the Bride he's in Bride form amen how could the groom come and not be the bride why because she's a further expression of the groom she was in the groom it's the groom's body it's the groom's spirit how could the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride this is what confuses so many people about the coming of the lord they're looking for the bridegroom the Mighty God the mighty Angels descended where did he go where did he go he's descended did he go back what are we looking for you're looking for the wrong thing when he comes how could he not be the bride because this is bride time bride manifestation this is the time that he is expressed in her man because she's part of the mystery
