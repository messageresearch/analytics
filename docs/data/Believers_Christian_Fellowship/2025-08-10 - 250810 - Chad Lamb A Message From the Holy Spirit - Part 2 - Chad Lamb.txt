It's good to be with you this morning. Let's go to the key of F. Washed by the water. Do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling? Not to wonder where you're going when you die. Not condemned by the past. Not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store and know the reason why. Yes, that's just how it is when you go down in the water. For by faith you believe in what you've heard. It's no impossible dream. You can start over clean when you're washed by the water of the word. Are you wash by the water? Washed by the water of the word. Are you washed by the water?

By the blood of God's own son. Are you washed by the water of the word? Yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word. Yes, I'm washed by the water. Washed by the water of the word.

Let's give the Lord a hand offering of praise. So thankful that he's washed us by the water. Amen. He wasn't looking at me when he took me in. He wasn't looking at my heart that was black by sin. He was looking at the blood flowing rich and free. That precious blood that covers me. He wasn't looking at me when he took me in. He wasn't looking at my heart that was black by sin. He was looking at the mud flowing rich and free. That precious blood that covers me. Through it all. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Verse one, [Music] I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. And there have been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave blessed consolation that my trials came to only make me strong. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I learn to depend upon his word. [Music] I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleys. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he can solve them. I'd never know what faith in God can do. Through it all, through it all. Through it all, I learn to trust in Jesus. I learn to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I learn to depend upon. Verse three, I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleyies. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through.

Never leave me alone. Without you, I could never. I'll never make heaven my home. I know that you'll walk. I know that you'll walk with me, Jesus. And you'll never leave me alone. For without you, I could never [Music] make my home. I was born to be a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. And my life now be separated unto thee, that I might be what I was born to be. For I was born to be [Music] a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Let my life now be separated unto thee, that I might be what I was born to thee. Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. And as we go to prayer, I wanted to uh remind you that brother Benjamin Seabold is away ministering. He's over in Pittsburgh ministering for brother John Kadima this morning. And then also brother Kyle Wer is across town ministering for Bible believers. So as we pray for this service, we want to remember our brothers away ministering as well. Let's bow our heads together. Dear Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Father, for your grace in our lives. Lord, we're so thankful that you've brought us together once again to hear your word. And God, may we never tire of you revealing yourself to us. May it never become common to us, but may each opportunity be a blessing. Lord, we've come, Lord, to just open our hearts to receive you, Lord. May you come and Lord, plant your seed deep in our hearts, Lord. And may you produce, Lord, the crop that you desire from this word, Lord. I pray you take control of my mouth, Lord, this vessel. May it be used for your glory. May you grant us all ears to hear and our heart to perceive all that you're sharing with us. Lord, bless our brothers who are away ministering, Brother Benjamin, Brother Kyle. May you anoint them and inspire them and bless the services and the congregations that are gathered in those places. And God, may your work be done, Lord, in your bride. And may we come to reflect you and only you in this world. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. While you're standing, if you'll grab your Bibles and turn with me to Genesis chapter 1. We're going to continue on with the uh same thought as we were we started on uh Wednesday. Um I hope you brought your booklets. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to take a few services. We have some more if you need them. The deacons have some at their seats. There's some out and the four. If you need to grab another one, feel free to. But if you don't mind, just tuck it in your Bible for the next few services. Uh because it might take us a couple to get through it. Amen. I thought it would be like a quick reading, but it's like anything else that God gives. Amen. Everything is packed so full of meaning and we we want all that we can get out of it. Amen. And we realize that as time goes on, God keeps revealing more and more and more. So we can go through this now. We can come back two years from now and we can go through it all over again. That's what I love about the word of God. It's eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also wanted to remind you that I'll be uh I and my family will be leaving this Thursday on our vacation. So, I'm planning on preaching Wednesday night and then we'll uh be heading out early Thursday morning. Uh while I'm gone, that first Sunday on the 17th, Brother Gabe Smith will be preaching uh for us here. As of right now, the Wednesday service is cancelled because of the projector project when they're redoing the projectors here in the sanctuary. And then the following Sunday, Brother Chris T will be taking the service for us. So, if you could just keep all of that in prayer, the project, the brothers, the services, and our family. Amen. Just just pray that uh that it all goes smoothly. Amen. Also, we want to welcome some visitors. We got a few visitors here. We just want to say God bless you. Amen. The Ley family has some relatives here. God bless you. It's good to have you here. And Sister Kay Yesi has her family with her. God bless you. It's good to have you all here as well. Amen. Well, let's turn to Genesis chapter 1 and let's look at uh verse 9. We read this last time. We're going to read a shorter portion, but we know that uh brother Brandham when he come to the message spoken word is the original seed. His opening scripture was Genesis 1 1-13. But we're going to pick it up here in verse 9. And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together the waters called he sees. And God saw that it was good. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and the herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. And may God bless us as we look at his word and give us eyes to see and ears to hear. Amen. It's amazing how his word has not changed for hundreds and thousands of years. It's stayed ever the same in in the Bible. It's been passed down from generation to generation. So, it's not that we need God to uh somehow anoint his word. His word's already anointed. It's perfect. God needs to anoint our eyes. Amen. Our understanding to see what's already laying there. So, we just pray that God would do that for us and give us understanding. If we could go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint. We're going to continue on. Keep your notebooks handy. Keep your Bibles in and these little booklets handy. And we're going to bounce around between those things uh together. Uh just as a little bit of a a recap, uh we're going to go into the section from the message where brother Brandham was told by the Holy Spirit to pick up his pen and write. And and we know if we if we read the message, spoken word is the original seed. We know brother Brandham was struggling with something. He didn't know what the next step was. He's come to a transition in the ministry and a transition in time. And he and he's asking the Lord, "What do I We're going to read some of those quotes like we did last time. And that that is the background for pick up your pen and write. And I think it's really important to understand the background because if we know what the prophet was questioning and what he needed and what he was desiring and what he was praying and what spoken word of the original seed is all about, then we understand what the Holy Spirit was trying to say. Amen. And pick up your pen and write. And like I said before, we've taken quotes from this. We've read it. We we've enjoyed it. uh we we we've we've preached on parts of it, but I just had a desire in my heart to go through the whole thing again. And as I did, I started realizing it's such a special special message that God gave to us through the prophet. And I just want to slow down and look at it. Amen. And then maybe circle back around, look at it again. I don't know. But I just I thank God for everything that he's given to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. When brother Benham here is in coming into 1962, like I said before, 1962 is a pivotal year in his ministry. It marks a change. It it's it's we're coming in we're coming in as the bride of Jesus Christ into a dispensational change. We're coming into the finishing up of the denominational age and the church ages and the ushering forth of the bride age where brother Ram is getting ready to move into his real commission to his real calling as a prophet and the opening of the seals. Amen. And he says all of these things but in 1962 he starts to sense that there's a change coming and he starts to preach in spoken word is the original seed about this change coming. And I think it's remarkable that this message uh spoken word is the original seed is a six-hour sermon. Brother M calls it one sermon, but he had to split it into two parts, morning and night, so everybody could break for lunch and come back, but it was one continuous thought. These are not two separate sermons. They were two parts to the same sermon. Amen. The spoken word is the original seed. And he comes back uh to Genesis 1. And it's amazing when he's going to preach this message, this pivotal message. He goes right back to the beginning in Genesis, the seed book of the whole Bible and through the original chapter, and he starts to show God laid down a principle. And that principle was that a seed must bring forth after its kind and can only bring forth after its kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the title is the spoken word is the original seed. So what's the original seed? God's spoken word. That's the original. Everything was made by God's spoken word. Everything that we see, everything we interact with is God's spoken word on display. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says here, now remember, every spoken word of God is the original seed. God planted everything in the earth by his word, and as long as you stay with the original seed, it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again. Hybrid, it dies. Oh, it's such a principle. He lays it down right here early in the message. And I hope that that God will help us that realize the principle and stay with it because God's spoken word is the original seed. And remember, every original seed will bring forth after its kind. And it will always reproduce itself again, perpetuate on and on and on and on and on. Amen. God planted an oak tree how many thousand years ago? And that oak tree keeps perpetuating itself again and again and again. As long as you don't hybrid it, it can breed itself back. And it can continue to be an oak tree. It can be a pear tree. It can be an apple tree. It can be whatever he made it to be. It can continue that way unless you hybrid it. When you hybrid it, you modify it. And as you modify, it can never come back to its original form again. &gt;&gt; This is such a principle that he's laying down. Amen. And it becomes so pivotal that we understand it. I know we understand it, but I don't think we understand it enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me God to understand it more is my prayer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says,"Now, oh, I remember sitting there in a room." Oh, praise be to God. I remember sitting there in a room three days in there praying and waiting on the Lord, fasting, when that struck me. I thought, "Oh, God, what is it? Here I am in a picture. Here I am. Here I am. If I bring up this much to the church, where will I be? I'll I'll I'll have them on a limb. What can I do? I've done seen the church as every type and shadow and everything else. She's gone. Show she's gone. What will you do? So, brother Brandham is struggling now. And what's he struggling with? He he is he is saying, God, I realize I see in every type and shadow I see in everything that the church is finished. It's done. And he's talking about the denominational systems, the systems of man. The church system is finished. It can't go any further. and God can't use it anymore to accomplish what he's got wanting to do in this age. And brother Bam comes to that and realizes that and understands it, but he doesn't know what the next step is. And that's what he's asking God, what do I do now? And he says he was praying three days and fasting. Then he says, "We believe we're in the end time. Do we do you believe that before you have a crop now you have to plant a seed? You see why I've let churches turn me out? Tell me everything. Call me all kinds of names, everything else, and just stay right with that word. See, there's a plant. A seed's been planted. Seed been planted. It's already been planted, friend. It's already done. I can say it now. It's over, right? She's done. Been planted. Oh, yeah. So is denominational seed. All the rest of them. And brother starts showing us. And and this is all review from Wednesday, but please bear with me as I review. Amen. Because the review is fun, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's the truth. Amen. So, as as we s saw, there was a great revival that struck America post World War II and that revival. Amen. Brother Brandham was very much the spearhead of that revival, bringing a healing ministry. And there was tent campaigns and tent meetings all over the United States. Amen. And there there was great revivals crisscrossing the country after World War II. Amen. And out of the revival, Amen. There came many prominent men. And brother Bam mentions uh he mentions two of them, Oral Roberts and and Billy Graham, showing that they were the head planters, amen, of the of the evangelical or the denominational group and the Pentecostal group. But brother Brandham himself was criss-crossing the nation, planting another seed. And that seed was a seed of the original word back to what the Bible taught, back to Paul's teaching. Amen. Because he had to tie together all the loose ends. Amen. Before, Amen. he got to the mystery that was hidden inside the white rock. Amen. So that's what he was doing. And brother Bam started in the healing campaign. And remember, he would start by saying, "Now I don't do any teaching. I'm just hearing the other men preach and I just come with a gift." And that's all through 47 and up to 53. But in 1953, he starts saying, "Now I'm going to start teaching because it's not being done." And we have to start teach. And you start seeing, hey, from 53 to 61, Brother Benham's really starting to teach and lay down the word. And he teaches the oneness of God, water baptism in Jesus name. serpent seed and he starts bringing all these truths back to the church. Amen. And starts playing there. He preaches the church ages and he lays them in straight and he shows us the history of the church and where it's got up to this point. And when he come and that's in 1960 towards the end of 1960. Amen. Then he shows us that there's going to be an opening of the seals in the beginning of 1961 and goes to Revelation chapter 4 and Revelation chapter 5. And he stops because he can't go any farther till God brings him into a transition. Right. &gt;&gt; And that's how he moves into 1962. Oh, praise be to God. I thank God that he's recorded this message. He's given it to us and and all of its beauty. Amen. So, we can watch the progression of God and see what God's trying to do. &gt;&gt; Now, he comes to this message and now he knows that the seeds have been sown. He said the denominational seed sown, the Pentecostal seed is, as far as denomination goes, is sown. Amen. the evangelical, the Pentecostal is sown. He says, "But the word has been sown." &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Now watch what comes next." Amen. It's been sown. Amen. During the the former rain, which is the teaching rain, which is the revival rain that was falling in that period, so that the seed could come and start the growth. Amen. But he said the seed's got to get in under the uh former rain because there's coming a ladder rain that's going to bring it to full harvest, maturity, and finish the full product. that we're not getting into today unless you keep pulling and we'll go right there &gt;&gt; because I'm pretty excited about it. Amen. Because it has everything to do with you and I today. &gt;&gt; So, this is the progression that he's on. And and it's interesting. I'm going to read a couple lengthy quotes to you. So, just keep your mind dialed in. Amen. And and and don't let your mind wander. In 1962, early in February, February 4th of 1962, right at the beginning, Brother Bram comes and says, "We see that astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part of the first part of the month, beginning on the second or the 5th or somewhere along this month, the Indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces." And the American newspapers make fun of it. I do not believe the world's going to blow to pieces. But I do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days. Something similar to that when the five planets, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and so forth comes into there. They they never had did it. Oh, they claim maybe 25,000 years ago, but who was back there to know it? I predict that this has a spiritual application. Remember what I'm saying about 1962? Here we are, February 1962. Amen. I I predict that as a spiritual application, I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God that the great revelations of the word will be open during this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was he right? &gt;&gt; This is before Amen. be this is before the vision or the dreams and the vision that send him out west. This is before Amen. the revelation of the seven seals. This is all coming before. So he knows something's coming. He's sitting here sensing it, feeling it, seeing it in every way. But he doesn't know the next step. That's why he's praying to God before pick up your pen and write. But here he comes. This is February, friends. He preaches uh spoken word as the original seed in the middle of March about 6 weeks later after he says this. He says, "I believe it's the coming in of the issue of God. The great revelations of the word will be open during this time." Remember, they claim it was three stars come into their orbits when Jesus was born. And this is five. And five is grace, the number of grace. Three is the number of perfection. Five is the number of grace. Jee su g r a ce f a i t h so forth. Number of grace. God ever sends his power to the church. It'll be his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It won't be the obedience of the people. And I say I when he says things like that, my heart just jumps. Amen. Because there's no way we could ever be good enough to get this kind of grace or get this kind of power or get what we need in the end time to be what he's prophesied this church will be. But it comes by his grace. Amen. That's why Zerubabel, the ministry of the seventh angel, Amen. brings forth the headstones with shouting of grace. Grace, double grace. Amen. Because it's God's grace to save me. It's God's grace to start the church. It's God's grace that'll finish the church. &gt;&gt; And that's the coming of the headstone. The capping off of the church. And it's by grace, not merit, not effort, not intellect, not study, not teaching, but grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Isaiah said in the 40th chapter, how cry to Jerusalem and her warfare was over. Yet she was guilty of idolatry, but it was God's grace that was sending it. God, if God sends anything to us, it'll be his grace, not our merits. &gt;&gt; So, it may mean something. I predict that there'll be a change. February 1962. I don't know what it'll be, but I believe it's fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; We're on we're right on the eve of it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then six weeks later, he'll come and he'll preach spoken words, the original seed. And that's what we've been quoting out of. That's where right before the message, he's told to pick up your pen and write. And he has a message from the Holy Spirit uh to the church. And so uh we'll read that. But the next day he preaches on Sunday. I believe it's Sunday uh March 18th. Uh he preaches spoken word the original seed, morning service, evening service. And then after the evening service, he gets in a car and he drives down to Georgia and he has one meeting on Monday in Georgia. And the meeting on Monday in Georgia the next day is the end time sign seed. So he preaches till evening, goes home, does whatever he's got to do. I presume pack, shower, change, I don't know, and get in the car and drive all the way to Tiffan, Georgia. Amen. And then that next evening, Monday evening, he's preaching the end time sign seed. Then he goes and says, "All of his numbers, his numerals of God is perfect, is in perfection." Now three is the number perfection. Just before now, he says, "Listen now close. When the little baby Christ was born, three stars went together and made the one morning star that reflected the coming of an infant Christ a perfect one. Now what's happened? We see a roar in the paper across the television out across the nations where five stars just fell in line with the world. What's five? A number of grace. Every time those stars come, then something happens on earth. What's taking place? Five stars fell in. What is it? An introducing of what? Remember, God says whenever he does something, he'll show signs in the heaven above and on the earth below. Amen. And the stars were given for signs. Amen. And so, it takes a prophet of God to know what the signs are. We can look up there all day long. Amen. And just guess. And in our guessing, we'll get everything wrong. But a prophet of God is the tool that God has used to interpret his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, the heavens declare the glory of God. The Bible was first written in the stars. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when what brother man was talking about back when he was in Febru on February 2nd or February 4th when he preached about that that coming that alignment was an alignment of five planets. The five planets that are visible to the naked eye they come into a conjunction they come into an alignment with the sun and the moon and there was a total solar eclipse uh and it all transpired between the 4th and 6th of February. So, fifth being the the center point of that. And and then when I looked it up on the internet just to find out what day it happened, I just typed it in and pulled it up and and they talked about the the the planets, they named them, the sun and the moon all in conjunction and then the solar eclipse. And then they they made a statement. They said some believed that it was the beginning of the end time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the beginning of the end time, but there's no scientific evidence to back this up. &gt;&gt; I just said, "Praise God." Amen. We don't need scientific evidence to back it up. Amen. Praise be to God. I don't know why that made me so happy. We know a little something the scientists don't know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it wasn't for science. It's not for them to know. It's for you to know. &gt;&gt; So back in the end time sign seed sermon, he says five stars fell in. What was it? An introducing of what? Since then, just look what's taken place. Germany almost washed off the map. Some of the magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon. Every distressful thing's prophesied by them for the last days. Look what's taking place. is England the other day had a storm that blowed away 70,000 houses in one day. Disaster everywhere. California, Los Angeles, like to wash into the ocean. What is it? The beginning of sorrows. Earthquakes is picked up everywhere. Why is it five stars come in line? Grace, God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Benam, it's amazing. There he's talking about judgment, birth painans, uh judgment striking the world. But he says five is grace. Five plants the line grace. It's grace to who grace is given to. It's judgment to the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; Grace, God's grace. Now listen what he says. What's happened? An infant church. Then he shouts, "Hallelujah. A bride infancy that the power of God has be to fall on her. She's taking form a bride for this bridegroom." That three stars meant his perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity. excuse me, becoming one on the earth among us. God's office is becoming one office. What happened now? It's the church of the living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach. &gt;&gt; Might not believe that, but it's the word just the same. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; What's happening? I'm closing. I might say this, friends. The church is coming forth. God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle. And she's predestinated. God said so he would have it. That makes it right. Who's a member? I don't know. I'm trusting to be myself. I'm trusting you're a member. But he's going to have a body without spot or wrinkle. And I believe that these latter-day signs and and things that's happening, every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride. As God in his word made manifest in a man, a perfect man, so is God in his word coming again and making himself manifest in a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not we'll do like Eve did hybrid it to something else. But the unadulterated word of God will be born into that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did with his spirit anointing in his word. Amen. I believe it's the announcing now. It's the announcement now. Amen. So now, brother Ben, oh when I see this, it just thrills my heart. Now I understand spoken word is the original seed. What all he's trying to tell us. And now pick up your pen and write. And then where it goes from there. Amen. Into into the fall. He says the present stage of my ministry and into December of 1962. Says, "Sers, is this the time?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's the time. That's what he's showing. This is the end of the time, the end of the ages. It's the transition. It's the dispensational change. Amen. That we've been waiting for. And here we are living in it, friends. And I believe we're living in the tail end of it. &gt;&gt; But this is how it was starting. This is how it was breaking forth. This is how it was ushering out that great transition, that great change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God announced it in the heavens above with an alignment of five stars and the sun and the moon and all kinds of news and all all kinds of uh uh uh things happening in the paper. But there's a prophet on God at the time that could point to that sign and say it's just like when Jesus Christ was coming to the earth. There was an announcement in the heavens and that announcement of the heavens was three stars that come into an alignment to announce the birth of Christ on the earth. And now he says now there's five planets come together. Amen. What's it done? He said it's the announcement. Now what's its announcing? The infancy of the bride. There's a bride coming forth out of the church. And what is the bride? It's him in bride form. It's Christ again on the earth in a many membered body. That's the announcement now. This is the transition. No more the church. Now the bride. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now that all this is leading up, the spoken word is the original seed. Now he's saying it's planted. It's planted. It's planted. Now see what comes forth. She's finished. It's finished. We're out on a limb. Where do we go from here? Oh, this is how he says it. I got a place here where I got in the spirit. I got the church up to show it and prove it in the word here exactly what's happened all along. And then when I did, I thought, Lord, I got the people standing here now. I'll have them standing there. What can I tell them? I can't predict the future. I can't tell them what to do. What will I do? I'll leave them standing on a limb. I raised up my hand. And I said, "God, I think I'm doing this by your will. I've never did this. Never did before because the seed hadn't been sewed yet." I said, 'Now, I've got I believe it's time for me to say it. But now, what am I going to say now? This is where Brother Benham's at. This is where he's wrestling. This is where he's come to this point that he knows he's preached the church ages. He knows he's in the Leodysian church age. He knows it's the end of time. He knows Christ is on the outside. Amen. Knocking at the door. He knows all of this. He knows it's at the end. He knows he could see the revival. Now he sees the revival dying down. He knows the seed has been sown. He knows now something is going to transition. But he says, "I can't predict the future." That's true. He's a prophet of God, but he as a man can't predict the future. That's God alone. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know the next step. And he's and brother Bam, you can tell by the things he's saying and spoken words, the original seed, he doesn't want to bring the people out on a limb and have nowhere to take them. He doesn't want to get them out and say, "It's finished. It's all done. The revival's dying down. It's all finished. It's dying. The the church is finished." And then now what? Go home and say whatever. &gt;&gt; So this is what he's wrestling with. This is what he's praying to God for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now, excuse me. So now he comes to the next part. He says, "And just as plain as you hear my voice, something said,"Pick up your pen. I'll read it to you in a minute. And when I got through, there it was, just the answer." I didn't even know what I was writing. Just started writing. And when I got through, I laid the pen down. I looked. I thought, "God have mercy." There it is right there. That's what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; So that's the significance. This is all the background. We did all this background to bring us to the significance of what we've got written in this little booklet. Amen. So, Brother Benham first brings it to us and spoken word is the original seed. You'll find it right at the end. Amen. At the end of that six-hour sermon, but then he takes that and he and he edits it and he and he puts it in, amen, the uh church age book, the church age book under the Pergeamian church age. So, that's the exer excerpt we clipped out and copied out and put in here because it's a little bit easier to follow. Like I said before, I love the one in spoken words, the original seed. But as brother Benham's going along and reading it, you can tell as he's reading it, he's also injecting a thought like he's he he's saying something and explaining something. And it's hard when you read it to determine what's he reading, what's he explaining. So that's why I I I took the other clip because it's easy for us to distinguish. But I would recommend listening to both. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listening to the one is spoken, where's the original seed. Amen. So let's open our little booklet. And let's turn to the first page out of the Pergamian church. We read through part of this on Wednesday. I'm just going to skim through it and pick it up where we stopped. One night as I was seeking the Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up my pen and write. As I grasped at the pen to write, his spirit gave me a message for the church. I want to bring it to you. It has to do with the word and the bride. Here is what I'm trying to say to you. The law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind, even according to Genesis 1:1. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. Whatever life was in the seed came forth into the plant, and then into fruit. The very same law applies to the church today. Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed, because it is the same seed. In these last days, the true bride church, Christ's seed, will come to the headstone, and she will be the super church, a super race as she nears him. They and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image. This is in order to be united with him. They will be one. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Now, what was Jesus Christ? He was the very manifestation of the word of the living God. What will his bride be in the end time? The very manifestation of the word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word made flesh. He was the word made flesh. Amen. And now this bride must also be the word made flesh. That word that's predestinated for this age has to take on flesh in a many membered body. And that's what God's doing now. &gt;&gt; Where is he doing it? In you, &gt;&gt; in me and his bride around the world. That's where he's doing it. So now we realize that this true bride, Christ's seed, the true bride is Christ's seed. Remember the principle that he's teaching us, the principle out of Genesis 1 is every seed brings forth after its own kind. So if you do not hybrid it, but you breed it back originally, it will always produce the same thing, the same life, the same characteristics, the same fruits, the same everything will come if you have the original spoken word seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus Christ is that seed. Christ, the anointed word, is that seed. And so now the true bride church. So what's the true bride church? Christ's seed. What is it? She's a continuation of the perpetuation of that life. &gt;&gt; She's original. &gt;&gt; She's original. She's what the church was when it came out of out of the upper room on the day of Pentecost. That was the original virgin bride. And God brought a bride fresh from the hands of God to Christ. Amen. Before she hybrided herself, she was she was perfect. Amen. And God is bring us back to that original seed, the original life, the original word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is Christ's seed. This is the only seed we're worried about. We're not worried about a Jesus Christ seed and a church seed. We're only worried about Christ seed &gt;&gt; and has to bring forth of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they will come to the headstone. Uh we talked about this last time but will positive affirmative will come to the headstone. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she will be in his very image. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. Denominations cannot produce this. Why can denomination not produce this wrong seed? They will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word. This monger lies brings forth a hybrid product. That's why there's no denominational system going to produce the bride of Christ. That's why he says it's got to change. The church has ceased. The church ages has ceased. God dealing with the two vines in the midst of the church has ceased. Now he's got to bring forth a bride out of that. Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Be ye separate and touch not the unclean thing. What is the unclean thing? Idolatry of mixing with man's ideas and hybridizing the word. Come back to the original word. Because there's been a prophet on the scene to bring us back to the full truth of the Bible. We don't have to debate or wonder what Paul meant when he says this or what Peter meant. We've had a prophet, amen, who come back and said, "This is exactly what Paul meant." And look, it's exactly the way it's written. It's exactly the way God gave it &gt;&gt; was the correct way. &gt;&gt; It didn't need scholarship. &gt;&gt; It needed a prophetic voice to bring God's true meaning of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why a denomination can never produce Christ on earth again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's the wrong seed. They will reproduce their kind &gt;&gt; and their kind is hybrid. &gt;&gt; So it'll keep reproducing hybrid. This mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product. Now next paragraph. The first son, Adam, was the spoken seed word of God. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. If we look here at Genesis 1:26, it says, "And God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So man was made in the image of God. He was to be a reflector of the life of God. And God took that man and put him in flesh and was going to give him dominion to rule over all the earth. He was going to be an amateur. Brother Beam calls it an amateur God, a little God, a God over the creation, a God over the earth, reflecting God, his father. And God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he male and female created he them. That's such an important scripture because when God goes to create himself and replicate himself and reflect himself into a life, he makes man, male and female. &gt;&gt; But this is the replication of himself. &gt;&gt; So God wants to be expressed this way. Amen. And male and female. And and it says, "And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's go back to our booklet. He was given a bride to reproduce himself. That is why the bride was given to him, to reproduce himself, to produce another son of God. But she fell. She fell by hybridization. She caused him to die. Remember, every seed can bring forth only bring forth after its kind. When she mingled with the wrong seed, she could never reproduce the perfect seed again. &gt;&gt; It was now hybridized. She was hybridized. She was mingled. She was corrupted. The the perfect womb that now was corrupted and could no longer bring forth the perfect seed again. Amen. So, so now uh that's why she caused Adam to die because Adam could not perpetuate himself. He could not reproduce another son of God because that's what he was supposed to do. Replicate himself another son of God until through Eve would have come the whole family. Brother Benham said Jeremiah would have come through her. Amen. Amen. Isaiah would have come the whole family of God would have been born upon the earth reflecting the life of God. &gt;&gt; She supposed to What would that have been? What would have the whole family of God been upon the earth? Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The anointed word made manifest on the earth. Amen. Christ. Christ's seed. Amen. But because she corrupted herself, she can no longer bring forth the pure Christ seed. &gt;&gt; We're on the same page. We're all together. Amen. He says, "Oh no, where am I at?" Yeah, I don't want to go ahead yet. Amen. So the original virgin was Eve &gt;&gt; before she was called Eve. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember when God formed her, he did not name her. &gt;&gt; He called her woman, which is a title, not a name. And but but Genesis chapter 5 says when the day that he created them, created man, he made them male and female, made them, and called their name Adam. So when he made them, their name was Adam. She was Adam. He was Adam because she was an extension of Adam. She came out of Adam. She was part of Adam. She was reunited with Adam. They were one in the mind of God. They were one because a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave be glued to united with his wife and they shall be one flesh. And God never gave her a name. Amen. She did not get a name till after she committed adultery and fell by hybridizing. Amen. By hybridizing the seed. And then after she was impregnated by the by the serpent, she was given a name and that name is Eve called mother of all living. &gt;&gt; But originally she was just supposed to be Adam. &gt;&gt; And she was the original virgin and her purpose was to reproduce a son of God, Adam upon the earth again. So she missed her purpose. So that's why Mary now becomes the virgin. &gt;&gt; The first woman was supposed to be the virgin womb that was supposed to produce the next son of God, the the Christ seed. But now Mary is going to have to be the replacement for Eve. &gt;&gt; That's why the whole Bible the Bible is one story, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; So beautiful to have a prophet come and restore us to these truths is so so thrilling to my soul because now you see the thought of God laid out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again. You got that? Because the natural birth was fouled up in the beginning. There's no way through the natural birth to bring it back again. So now the only way to bring it back is to be born of the word and spirit. Amen. Got to come back to the original word and the original life and receive it in the womb of the mind. Drop it into the soul. Amen. To quicken the seed that's there to life. Amen. And that brings us back to the original life. Now it's a spiritual birth now. It can't be a natural birth. Has to be a spiritual birth. &gt;&gt; It brings back the spoken word again like in John 3. See, to be born of the water and the spirit, what does it do? Then it brings you right back again to the place of where you should have been at the beginning. See, that's the reason Christ's death brings us right back again to where? Sons of God. If Eve would have brought forth that child, she would have finally done it. Did not God tell her, "Multiply and replenish the earth." Praise God. He goes on to say, "I believe the Bible is the word, the whole truth, and Jesus is the word made manifest. He and his word is one and the same." What was he? Now look, he was that seed. I got to hold something back in order to get it there this evening. You see, it's hard. He was that seed that Eve should have produced. Do you get it? He was the seed Eve produced, but she hybrid it by disbelieving God's word. So, how did she hybrid it? By not staying true to the word. And when she disbelieved the word, she hybrid the seed by mingling it with another seed. And can ne that now can never reproduce of its kind &gt;&gt; because it's been changed. But now we can go back by the death of Jesus Christ, by the price that's been paid that can sanctify us so that his life can now the original life can now come in and touch the original seed that's down in our soul. Amen. Brother Bam said that little thing down there that was meant to be you. Amen. You came anyways, but you came wrong. &gt;&gt; We come trapped in hybrid flesh with a mind alienated, darkened to the things of God. Amen. But Christ gave his life so that there would be a power through his blood of redemption and a sanctifying power that could wash us and free us from sin by his death in our place. Amen. Because he was our substitute. God took our sins and placed it upon him. And his shedding of his blood washed us so that God through his sanctifying power could come and indwell us. And when he come indwell us, he'd bring life to that seed, that predestinated gene of God, and quicken it back and bring back the original life. Amen. This is sometimes why we struggle so much. You know, Brother Bram tells the story about the white dog and the black dog. He talks about the Indian chief saying, "Since I got the Holy Ghost," Amen. There's two dogs fighting in me. He said, "Which ones wins?" Amen. He says, "The black dog or the white dog." He said, "Whichever one I feed the most." Amen. Why? Because you've been quickened back that seed that was meant to be you from the beginning. the true you, the real gene of God down on the inside has sparked to life by contact with the true word and the true life of Jesus Christ that has brought it to life. But you're still trapped in hybrid condition, hybrid mind, hybrid body. Amen. So we're constantly at war with ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it causes us so much, amen, so much confusion sometimes that we don't understand. That's why God bringing a prophet in our day brought such understanding back to the children of God so that we would have the faith to take our God-given position to believe this word and to be able to step into what a prophet has brought us in this day because it's the word to be fulfilled in this hour. But it's got to be fulfilled by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've got to be able to overcome the hybrid condition and understand where the hybrid condition come in and understand why if I'm born again by the spirit of God, why do I still flare up in anger? Why is it still the temptations? Why is there still wrong desires in my flesh? I'll tell you why. Because Eve mingled the seed. Amen. Because you didn't come the right way. Amen. You come trapped in this cage called hybrid flesh. But God is going to change that someday by his power. Amen. The quickening power of God will change these very atoms to bring us back to what we were originally supposed to be. &gt;&gt; But the first step in that change, amen, is bring back through a new birth. Why do we have to be born again? Cuz our first birth is in a fallen condition and hybrid. So we got to I mean the whole concept of new birth has everything to do with the fall in the garden of Eden and the loss of a virgin condition and bringing forth Christ. &gt;&gt; We must be born again. Why? To bring us back to the original life, the original seed, which is the only thing that can reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; It's in me. &gt;&gt; It's in me. &gt;&gt; But it's like little little pastor Lily. Brother Brandham said that life is down and the muck and the mire. Amen. And somehow a little bit of light filters through muddy water and strikes that seed and starts a process of life and it has to push its way up through the dark muck and mud and up through the dirty amen. Dirty uh uh slimy water and up to the surface and poke its head out. But when it does, it begins to bloom and give forth life of of brother said Reverend Mr. Lily. Amen. What's it doing? It's showing what life was down in the muck and in the dirt and in the dirty water. Amen. And when we give ourselves to Jesus Christ and allow his life to take over us and we subdue the outer man and die to oursel and let Christ live on the inside, he starts pushing that little lily through the muck and the mud and the mire of this flesh so that he can poke it out and start to show the life of Jesus Christ on display. &gt;&gt; But oh, it's such a push through mud. It's such darkness. It's such &gt;&gt; murky water. But he's going to have it, friends. &gt;&gt; He's having it. She's pushing her way through. It's coming by the power of God, by the power of his word, by the life that's been released. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this bride fell. But he says in Genesis 3, I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. This is the first prophecy of a virgin birth laying in the Bible. Amen. that that there's going to come a seed from the woman. &gt;&gt; We know it because a woman doesn't have a seed. The man has the seed. The woman's the field. Amen. But from the from the woman, is going to come a seed. This is a prophecy of Jesus Christ coming through a woman. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Christ should have come through that first womb, &gt;&gt; but it was polluted. So he lays down. He lays down when he comes and brings his judgment and brings correction, he lays down a prophecy that there going to be a seed from the woman. And we know that woman was Mary and that seed was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just keep going. Let's go back to our booklet. Uh paragraph 171-3. And I'll just stop here and explain the paragraph numbers. If you see paragraph 171-3, that means in the blue book of the uh exposition of the seven church ages in that book that's printed printed by voice of God. This is on page 171, paragraph 3. So that's what those mean. So if you want to go back and look at any church ages book, that's what that means. So 171-3 says, "The second son, Jesus, also a spoken seed word of God, was given a bride like was Adam. But before he could marry her, she also had fallen. She, like Adam's wife, was put to the test whether she would believe the word of God and live or doubt the word and die. She doubted. She left the word. She died. So we see the repeat of this now. And the spiritual woman, which was the virgin bride that was given to Christ, fresh from Pentecost, fresh from the hands of God. Amen. She was born on the day of Pentecost, filled with the spirit of God. Amen. a church, a bride that Christ could marry. But before he could marry her, before they could come, remember Paul tells the church, he says, "I I'm jealous over you with godly jealous you because I have espoused you into one even to Christ." So Paul's saying, "You're engaged. Just stay true. You're engaged, but I'm worried over you lest you be deceived the way Eve was." What's he saying? Listen, we've come back to a virgin womb. You're engaged to Christ. keep going on and keep yourself pure and walk in the word. I'm worried that you're going to be beguiled at the same way that Eve was beguiled in the beginning. And what he was worried about is exactly what happened to the first church. &gt;&gt; They were beguiled by what? Amen. By by Satan again coming in as ministers of light and and starting to mix the word and mix it with old Judaism, mix it with traditions, mix it with ideas, and mixed it all up until they all got mixed up and hybridized again. And so now the church came forth clean and pure. Amen. What was she? She She was the replacement for the woman that fell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But she fell too &gt;&gt; by hybridizing the word. She left the word. She died. Next paragraph. From a little group of the true seed of the word. Where does this bride come from? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we got to see that whatever that life is down inside of us, that's where it came from. From the mind of God, the thoughts of God. Amen. Now spoken. Says the little group of the true seed of the word. God will present Christ with a beloved bride. She is virgin of his word. She is virgin because she knows no manmade creeds or dogmas. Why is she virgin? Because she doesn't know man-made creeds or dogmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, this isn't about being the nicest person on the planet. This isn't about living the the cleanest life. That's not what this is about. This is about not hybridizing the word anymore. Coming back to the truth of the word and not mixing it with anything else. &gt;&gt; She is virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled. all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the virgin. I I I get so excited sometimes I can't contain myself. What was God? What was the promise through the virgin? Well, to me, let's go all the way back to the first virgin, &gt;&gt; which we know is Eve, but she was really Adam in the beginning. &gt;&gt; What was the promise through the first virgin? to multiply and replenish the earth or to bring forth the God race to bring what race? What race was she to bring forth? Let's just say it this way. The way brother Be said it early on, the super race. &gt;&gt; The God race. God replicated in flesh as a family of God upon the earth. Sons and daughters of God upon the earth. She was supposed to bring forth, Amen. the the the the continuation of the of of Christ, the anointed word. She was supposed to bring forth that seed. She was supposed to replicate Adam, a son of God, on the earth again. That's the original virgin. That's the promise to the original virgin. But when she fell, there came another promise of another virgin. And this virgin was going to bring forth the Christ seed. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 7:14, "Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel." Emanuel means God with us. Amen. What was this promise through this virgin? She was supposed to bring God back to the earth. &gt;&gt; God in the form of his son, God in flesh, God in Jesus Christ was Emanuel, God with us. Hey, listen. That's the promise for this day, friends. When that Christ can live in you and I, and he comes to take his abode, amen, upon this earth in his tabernacle, which is his many membered body. Amen. It brings Emanuel on earth again. Amen. God with us. That's he's with us on the earth. Amen. But it's God in us. &gt;&gt; God in us brings Emanuel back to the earth. &gt;&gt; That's the promise. Here's another promise. Isaiah 9:6. For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given, and the government shall be on his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. This is what the virgin was supposed to bring on the earth. &gt;&gt; What's the virgin in the end times supposed to bring? the same thing the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's continue on. Oh, the word of promise. We're still not finished from this is review. &gt;&gt; The word of promise came to the Virgin Mary, but the word of promise was he himself. I'm going stop there. He himself to be made manifest. What was the word of promise? He himself to be made manifest. Listen, this is why this is so important to me. The word of promise, he himself to be made manifest. Are we supposed to receive the word of promise in this hour? &gt;&gt; What will it be? He himself to be made manifest. It's not receiving doctrines, friends. It's not receiving teachings. This is the unveiling of God in our day. It's Christ himself. Amen. It's he himself coming to manifest himself, but he's got to have a virgin womb to come through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary, but the word of promise was he himself to be made manifest. God was made manifest. He himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin. It was an angel that had brought her the message. But the angel's message was the word of God. Isaiah 9:6. He fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her. Oh, praise God. Why did Eve not bring forth the right seed? Because she didn't accept all that was promised to her. She didn't accept the full word. She doubted and mingled it with reasoning. &gt;&gt; But when Mary come along, when God came, Amen. And Mary now was the virgin womb that was going to bring forth the Christ seed into manifestation in flesh. Amen. She came and God started by bringing her an angel messenger. And the angel messenger, what he brought her was the word of God. Isaiah 9:6, he said what he brought to her was not an idea, not a concept. He brought her the word. when he brought her the word, that word was he himself coming to manifest himself. &gt;&gt; And this this woman Mary, she she has to believe the word &gt;&gt; and she has to stay true to the word. Amen. So God was made manifest. Now listen, he himself acted at that time on fulfilled his own word of promise. He himself. This isn't what Mary did. What could Mary do? Ask me what Mary could do. How How could Mary Mary could read Isaiah 7 all she wanted. She could reads Isaiah 9:6 all day long. She could say, "I have a desire to bring this word manifest on the earth." There's not a thing Mary could do to produce the word. Amen. She couldn't do it. She probably didn't even know that that prophecy was for her day. Amen. It took an angel messenger to come from the presence of God and say, "Listen, Mary, there's a time now. We're at a junction of time. There's a transition taking place. God is now going to fulfill his promised word. And guess what? He wants to use your virgin wound to do it." Amen. &gt;&gt; And Mary, listen, Mary asked the question, but uh how &gt;&gt; how let's let's turn together to Luke. Let's look at this in Luke chapter 1. Luke chapter 1, let's look at verse uh 26. Luke 1 26. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin, espouseed to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." Just stop for a minute. Let's quit reading about Mary and start reading about the end time bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was an angel. Was there an angel sent in this age? Was it the seventh angel? &gt;&gt; A prophet of God. Amen. A messenger from God to come and bring a message to a virgin. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the angel came into her and said, "Hail, thou that are hardly thou thou that are highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." Listen, I I can just imagine that when Mary gets this message, she was she was troubled in herself, the Bible says, because she didn't understand what this angel was saying. How am I highly favored? I'm from Nazareth. Nobody knows me. So, Brother Bam says she was probably around a 16-year-old girl, betrod to an older man, ma, imagining about her marriage coming up, and all of a sudden, she meets an angel, and the angel tells her a message that's so unbelievable, amen, that that you are highly favored and the Lord is with you. &gt;&gt; She may not have known that, but whatever life we were living, friends, no matter where we were and what we were doing, there was an angel that came to us one day and said, "You are highly favored and the Lord is with you." And we were like, "Who? Me? &gt;&gt; Yes, you." Amen. and you nobody from nowhere from the lowest and the down and out. It's you. This prophecy is about you. This end time message is about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when verse 29, when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God. &gt;&gt; Favor is grace. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and thou shalt shall call his name Jesus, and shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Then Mary Then said Mary unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" Most logical question she could have asked. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God." Listen, quit reading about Mary and start reading about the end time bride. It's going to be the Holy Ghost. Brother Bam said through the denominational ages, this Holy Ghost has been bound by the denominational waters for nearly 2,000 years. It'll be released in the evening time. By the evening time message, the Holy Ghost back in the people again. &gt;&gt; How's he going to produce himself? How's he going to reproduce his life? How's he going to bring forth the Christ seed? I don't understand what you're saying. I can't make it out in my mind. Forget about your mind. There's something down in your soul that can say, "Be it unto me according to your word." There's something that you're saying that resonates. Not here because I don't know how I'll do this not knowing a man. I don't know what you mean about highly favored Lord with me. I don't understand all of that. But there's something down inside that says that's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; He says, "And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age. And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word." And the angel departed her. &gt;&gt; Listen, here we go again. What could Mary do to bring forth the promised son, to bring forth the promised word, to fulfill the prophecy laying in Genesis 3, uh, Isaiah 7, Isaiah 9 and 6. What power did she have? None. What ability did she have? None. What knowledge did she have? Probably almost none. Amen. God was not looking for her ability. God was looking for somebody who could receive his word in due season, in the right time. He was looking for the right vessel in the right season that could say, "Be it unto me." &gt;&gt; Listen, God wasn't saying, "Mary, I need you to work hard, and I need you to do this, and I he was coming and saying, it's time for the promise, and you're the chosen vessel, and God's going to bring forth the seed now. He's going to fulfill his word. He's going to bring him forth. He's going to establish him. Amen. Now she runs to visit Elizabeth. Let's keep reading. And Mary rose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost. This is one of my favorite scriptures because prophet of God gives us background. He says Elizabeth had six months with child and hadn't felt the baby move yet. We know she's she's she's supernaturally received a conception in her old age from her husband from Zachariah. An angel visited him too and told him and this is going to be the forerunner to Jesus Christ. Amen. This is going to this is John the Baptist that's in her womb but hadn't moved. Hadn't had no sign of life, nothing. But when Mary comes and brings her salutation, what? And brother B said, "What was the salutation?" She told her what the angel said. And as soon as she mentioned the name Jesus, the babe leapt within her. Amen. And she was filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. And and I began to realize when I read this, Amen. There was Mary. There was a woman who had the promised word of her day come alive inside of her. And she went with a testimony that I believe what the angel told me. And brother Benham said she didn't feel one sensation. She didn't have a feeling of any kind, a sensation of any kind to prove that that was true. Amen. All she had was a witness in her heart. She believed it to be the truth. And what the angel told her was true. &gt;&gt; And if he said, "You're the one and now's the time." She said, "Be it unto me." She witnessed that it was the truth. But brother Bam said before she felt one thing stir in her womb, before she had any sensation at all or any evidence or proof that she had conceived this child, she went running straight to Elizabeth and told Elizabeth all that had happened because she received it based on the word &gt;&gt; on the word. And the word alone, the word of a messenger, amen, told to her and she had a witness in her heart and she received it based on the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we move forward by the word that we receive? Can we say, "Amen. I'm part of the bride of Jesus Christ." Not because I've earned it, not because I'm good, and not because I feel like it every &gt;&gt; day. I'm so glad we had a prophet of God that God used so supernaturally that there was no question that him and God were on an intimate basis. Amen. And he told us, he goes, "I backslide every day. I make mistakes all the time. And then somebody asked him, "Brother Brandon, how do I how can you know that you're saved or something like that?" He said, "I can't even prove that I'm saved. I just believe it by faith." &gt;&gt; And he says, "I" and and the question was, "I sometimes don't feel like I'm saved." Brother Bam said, "Sometimes I don't feel like I'm saved." &gt;&gt; So, let's quit relying on feelings and get back to the truth of the word. Has the messenger said that you're this bride? As he said, it's time now for this manifestation of Christ in bride form. Is there something in you says, "I want that to be unto me according to your word." Then stick with it, friends, and don't back down the next time you have bad feelings or a bad day or things go wrong or you make a mistake or you even backslide. Stop the nonsense and come back to the word. The word is the original seed, not a feeling or a sensation. But the word has the power. The word has the life. The word is the truth. &gt;&gt; Our feelings lie. &gt;&gt; The word never lies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now she's got this life in her without sensation. She just starts proclaiming. And as soon as she proclaims it to Elizabeth, Elizabeth has a promised seed word inside her womb, but it hasn't sprung to life yet. But when one woman with the seed alive in her speaks her testimony to another woman with the seed laying dormant in her, all of a sudden that seed starts springing to life. What caused it to come to life? It was the present tense truth. Christ in a bride. When she began to testify of that, it brought that other seed to life. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what we're doing, friends. Testifying of the life that is in us &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 40. And entering into the house of Elizabeth, Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth. And it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost. And she spake out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this, whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord shall come to me? For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leapt in my womb for joy. And blessed is she that believed." Oh, get this, friends. And blessed is she that believed. What did Mary do? She believed. What works did she do? None. She believed. All of her works and all of her testimony and everything had to do with the fact that she first believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed is she that believed, for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. Why? Because she believed. God wasn't looking for somebody who could produce the seed. He was looking for somebody that could believe the word for her day. Amen. &gt;&gt; When God come to Abraham, he wasn't looking for somebody that could produce a promised son because Abraham couldn't produce a promised son. By the time God came to him, he had lived decades with his wife. She was barren and unable to produce. Amen. And he wasn't coming to Abraham says, "Now you produce this." Abraham couldn't produce this. He come down and said, "I'm going to give you a seed." And he kept he kept clarifying the prophecy as time moved down. And then as time moved down, now now Sarah couldn't produce the seed. And now Abraham could no longer produce the seed. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was as good as dead. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God wasn't asking Abraham to produce anything. He was only asking Abraham to believe his word. That's all he needed was somebody who could believe it. And and in Hebrews says, he staggered not at the promise of God, but grew strong in faith. The weaker he came, the more unlikely it was and the less ability he had, the more he believed. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We live in such a scientific age, but science's not going to get us there. &gt;&gt; Remember back in February of 1962, there had been astronomers that had predicted for thousands of years there was a destruction coming at this alignment. There was many people who believed, amen, that that this was a sign of the end time. But no, there's no scientific information to verify that. &gt;&gt; So quit relying on science. Amen. We've had a prophet with the word of God verified it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So blessed is she that believed, for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. Let's go back to our little booklet back at the bottom of paragraph 171-5 says, "But the angel's message was the word of God." Isaiah 9:6, "He fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because," if you got a pen, circle because &gt;&gt; this is an important word. &gt;&gt; He fulfilled at that time all that was written of him. And can you go up and underline? He fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Who did the work? He did the work. Who had the power? He had the power. Who had the ability? He had the ability. But what did he need? He needed somebody who would believe it. &gt;&gt; He fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her. This is where Eve failed, friends. This is exactly where Eve failed. Eve started thinking about producing the word herself. Amen. The word was multiply and replenish the earth. Amen. The Satan came through the serpent and began to whisper to her other ideas and began to tell her and reinterpret the word and misinterpret the word to her. And she began to look at herself and ability and inability and what she could do and couldn't do. And she went through all of this and she failed to believe the word. She believed, but she misunderstood the word because she didn't stay with the original word. She took some reasoning and mixed reasoning with it and confused herself and went forward of her own effort &gt;&gt; and she brought death. &gt;&gt; If she would have stayed with the word, brother Bram said in order for the word to reproduce itself to be fulfilled, it can never bring death. So whatever he meant by multiply and replenish when it would have come there according to his will and his word, it could never bring death. There would have been no death on the earth. But when you hybrid it, it brings death. The original word can't bring death. So now he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her. Listen, what do you think God's looking for in this end time? You think he's looking for a stunning group of people that are so intelligent and have such self-restraint, have such willpower that they're going to He's looking for somebody who will believe his promise. &gt;&gt; Maybe weak, maybe incapable of a lot of things in our lives, maybe with a lot of misunderstanding and that's not what he's looking at. He'll fulfill his own word. But he's looking for somebody to believe it. Just believe it. Amen. Let's continue on. Now, let's go to verse 46. Before we read 46, I want we're going to read Mary's response. And when you read Mary's response, I don't want you to think about Mary. I want you to think about yourself as the virgin wound that he's restored back to a virgin condition so that he can unite with you and he can reproduce himself in you. And when you hear Mary's testimony, amen, let it be more than Mary's testimony. And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord." Hallelujah. Does your soul magnify God because of the great thing that he did for you that you couldn't do yourself that you had no power to do? You couldn't decide who's a prophet, not a prophet, whether you'll hear or not hear, whether you could believe or not believe. He designed all of that. Amen. And it's so easily you just seemingly just stumbled into it or stepped into it and it just happened. Mary wasn't looking for anything. Mary wasn't trying really hard. Mary was just going about her business and God found a way to get the message to her. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God found a way to get the message to us. &gt;&gt; Our soul should magnify the Lord. Magnify the Lord on high because we were nobody from nowhere with no idea what to do or what time it was or what part of the word to be fulfilled. But he brought it to us through a messenger and he had placed something in us that could receive it and believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord. My spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior. For he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaidaden. For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. I feel like the most blessed human being on the planet. &gt;&gt; For he that is mighty hath done me great things, and holy is his name. And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. He has showed strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away. He hath hope in his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spoke to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed forever. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say the same thing, friend? This is my testimony. Mary is crying out my heart's desire to say God, it's his strength, his might, his power, and he's keeping his promise to the seed of Abraham. Don't forget, Paul tells us that we're seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Under the unconditional covenant of grace, and the seed of Abraham is Christ, and ye are Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh, we should read it again and again and again until we just break out in praise because our soul does magnify the Lord. He's looked on the lowest state of his handmaiden. I was nothing. Amen. I still am nothing in myself. But he has taken me and he has lifted me on high. He's brought the high high and mighty theologians, philosophers, and all the intellectuals. and he's dropped him down to nothing by taking a a a a humble man out of Kentucky with a seventh grade education, not even able to pronounce the long words in his Bible. And he has brought to nothing all the wisdom of the wise and he's exalted his word back to where it should be. &gt;&gt; And he's taken his bride and he's lifted her on high &gt;&gt; by his promised word. He showed strength with his arm. Mary's not there talking about anything she did. She's not rejoicing because I was able to this and I thought that and I did this. She didn't do a she didn't do a blessed thing except I believe &gt;&gt; being into me. And even that was by the grace of God by predestination. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the word of God. Amen. Amen. We better keep moving. This is where we stopped last time. this sentence. I I think so. Let's keep going. The true bride, hallelujah, there's going to be one. Why? She's predestinated. She won't be denominated because she's predestinated. See, she don't have to worry about some denomination. She's already predestinated to take the place. Look, like Mary, I want you to get this now. And don't fail. Are you ready? Amen. When Christ comes to his bride, she will be a virgin like Mary was. For God will not bring Christ through the womb of a And neither will he bring the bride. He can't bring his word through a of his word. So what does he have to do first before listen before Christ can come to his bride? He's got to wash that bride and wash her away from all the filthiness of denominations. And how does he do it? He does it as we read in Ephesians. He does it by the washing of the water by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what was God doing when he was tying together the loose ends and restoring the word of God? Amen. He was washing away the filth of all hybrid religion, washing away all false understanding, washing away all Amen. the the misunderstanding of the Bible and bringing back the pure clean water that could wash a bride clean. &gt;&gt; And he had to bring her back to a virgin condition. How did he bring her back to an virgin condition? The original word would bring her back to the original condition. &gt;&gt; By the word and the spirit brings us back to the original life. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; He can't bring his word through a of his word. Them is horrible words, but that's what the Bible says. I'm saying what it says. This has got to be understood to prove true bride like Mary will have a virgin womb for the bride of the word which is Christ. When Christ the word comes to the bride, she'll be the same as he is virgin by the word. What makes her virgin? Because there's no man-made creeds or dogmas in her. &gt;&gt; She's come back to the original word and been washed by that word. &gt;&gt; And spoken word again says man wasn't made to die. He was made to live by hybriding brought death there rather she hybrid now you deny the serpent seed then I'll ask you why what's these funeral services about she was hybrid every one of us are hybrid from the original that's the reason you're constantly dying but oh god there's a germ of life come from the real seed but god proved it was his seed rose them up again see that through that life that's going over the original seed like was given to Eve over his real church is bringing forth life again through the birth, through the womb of his bride. Oh, it's rich and glorious. I give it a little time to study so it'll sink in. He is that seed. He is that seed that was produced by the word of God. Be it unto me according to the word. There's the seed. See, taking the word. &gt;&gt; How are we receiving the seed of Christ to reproduce Christ? By taking the word. That's how we receive the seed. by receiving this message in its fullness. By receiving the restored word, by receiving the truths that have been laid out for the bride, just by taking it in, not questioning it, not reasoning, and not overthinking it. Amen. Just taking it in and saying, "Be it unto me according to that word." &gt;&gt; That's receiving. That's taking the word. There's the seed. And he says, brother Bam says in Mark 6, or not, brother Bam, Jesus is going to say in Mark 6, "Is not this the carpenter son of Mary, the brother of James and Joseph and Judah and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?" And they were offended at him. But Jesus said unto them, "A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own ken, and in his own house. and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folks and healed them and he marveled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching. Why was it Jesus couldn't do why was it he could not do mighty work there? because they didn't believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He couldn't do Listen, the Jesus was not diminished in his power. &gt;&gt; One drop. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wasn't diminished in his ability. One drop. &gt;&gt; He could keep his word. He could perform miracles. He could open blinded eyes. He could heal the sick. He could raise the lame. He could raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Everything he did in any other village, he could do in their village. The only reason he could not do mighty works there is because of their unbelief. &gt;&gt; He would go here and not do mighty works. He would go to another village and heal all their sick. &gt;&gt; Because they believed. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me not have unbelief that hinders the work in this end time. But just God quicken my faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God just needs somebody to believe. Next, next paragraph on our booklet 172-1. The members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him. They are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. His potentials. &gt;&gt; What are his potentials? I just want to ask you what are his potentials limited? &gt;&gt; Unlimited potentials. &gt;&gt; How? Because he is their head and all power belongs to him. They are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What moves my finger? My head. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What lifts my leg? My head. What opens my mouth and speaks? My head. Amen. Everything in my body is directed from my head. If we are connected to the head, to the headstone, to the fullness of the word, and the word is moving down unto us, he can do anything he wants to do through us. &gt;&gt; We have his potentials. He says in Ephesians, "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is savior of the body. Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything." What's he speaking of, brother Bam? gets Jesus or Paul, sorry, gets to the end of this statement. He says, "This is a great mystery, but I'm not talking about a man and a woman. I'm talking about Christ in his church. &gt;&gt; If you want to get anywhere, just submit." Amen. If you want anything to happen, just surrender. Amen. Quit trying to figure anything out and quit trying to do anything. Just surrender and let him do it. The key is surrender. The key is submission. That's where That's where Eve fell. That's where the first church fell. Eve failed to bring forth the natural seed. The the son of God replicated on the earth. But Mary, she come by faith in the word that was given to her, produced that seed. How did she do it? By faith. By surrender. Didn't think it up. Didn't conjure it up. Didn't work it up. She just surrendered. Eve didn't surrender to the word. She began to reason with the word &gt;&gt; and she begin to find her own way to bring forth the word. &gt;&gt; What did the first spiritual bride do? Did she bring forth that full spiritual seed? No. Before she could bring forth that spiritual seed, Christ. Amen. Before he could marry her, Amen. She was already found in adultery. What did she do? She tried to find her own way. She tried to reason again and figure it out. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but just as there was a replacement for the natural woman and Mary, there's a replacement for the spiritual woman and the bride at the end time. And the bride at the end time is going to do what Mary did. Amen. Why? Because she's predestinated to take that spot. There's going to be a people on the earth that don't have to figure it out, don't have to be smart, don't have to be intellectual, don't need to be theologian. All they need to do is have a will inside of them to surrender to the word and say, "It's true, friends. It's true. How is it true? I can't figure it out, but it's true. &gt;&gt; And then what caused Eve to fail? Brother Beam said she couldn't wait. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What caused the the first church to fail? Brother Beam said the same thing. She couldn't wait. &gt;&gt; Listen, we've got nothing to do in this to make it happen. And the only thing we have is to surrender. &gt;&gt; If we start trying to conjure up a plan, a program, a way, figure something out or some super intellectual or revelation or an ability and start experimenting with things. Listen, that's the wrong way. Just rest and let the headship do it all. Let Christ the head do it through his body. Amen. And and we just need to rest and let God do it all. &gt;&gt; We've got to believe &gt;&gt; that the full potentials are here. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all here. All we got to do is surrender. Mary brought forth Christ. She just surrendered and gave herself to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. This bride is going to bring forth Christ. She's bringing forth Christ. But it'll be by surrender. &gt;&gt; See, when Adam came to his wife, she was pregnant. She had done something. She was mixed. She was hybrid, the child, and it died. But when Joseph come to his bride, she was pregnantated. with life. Adam's wife or Adam's bride. When Adam before they came together, just like Joseph and Mary, just like Christ in the church now, don't you see it? And before they came together, Adam and Eve, she was pregnantated with the corrupt seed from the serpent. And when Adam come to his wife, he found her pregnant to death. See death. How? Spiritually and physically dead. But when Joseph the human came to his wife, glory can't hardly hold her. She was pregnantated with life. The word of God, flesh in her womb. Bring back the spoken word. Bring back the word of God, which was word here came through a human's womb. Amen. God will do it anyhow. He spoke it. And it's got to be. So that's our God. Oh, that's rich, brethren. If you can dissolve it, you can hit it. That's where he found when Adam came to his wife, she was pregnant with the wrong seed. But see, this that seed died. Joseph came to us. She was pregnantated. Now, what caused the difference? The different pregnantation because that Adam's wife doubted the word. That's right. Joseph's bride believed the word. That's the difference. &gt;&gt; What's the difference to us in the first church? The first church started doubting and started mixing. Amen. But this bride, I don't care if it takes another 100 years, 150 years, 200 years, she's not going to doubt the word because she's predestinated not to doubt the word. She'll hang on and just believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when the bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made creeds and dogmas take the place of the word of God, she is committing adultery." Didn't Jesus say, "Whosoever lookth upon a woman has committed adultery with her already in his heart. Looked upon the woman to lust after hath committed adultery with her already." Why? She let it come into his mind. That's the womb that starts the things moving. Satan, come in. We were swed with the word. Someday I'll bring that the life into the earth and replenish the earth. What Eve failed to do, Mary did. She took the word. Eve took Satan's lie. Mary took God's word. And and through Mary's seed replenished the earth again. How? Oh. Oh, we're going to get to it. Just hang on, friends. through Mary's seed replenished the earth again. But but Jesus never married. Jesus never in the natural, we're talking natural. He never married. He never had children. He never had offspring. He was cut off. Who shall declare his generation? Because he was cut off from the land of the living. Where is his offspring? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Through Mary's seed. What's that? Christ. Through Mary's seed replenish the earth again. What's this? The original promise. the original commandment that was given to Adam. &gt;&gt; But through Mary's seed replenish the earth again through his bride through the word and will bring up the millennium. Through that goes forth the word and the word is planted into every predestinated heart and the spirit comes down and waters it and they cannot die. I'll raise them up again at the last day. Oh brother, sister, that's real. What is it? He through Mary's seed, he's replenished the earth again. Why? because he's going to have an earth filled with sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to have some purging yet. There's got to be a rapture and a resurrection and a restoration, but it's going to be there because he's replenishing the earth now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through a seed, &gt;&gt; through Christ's seed, &gt;&gt; now look at this quote in in marriage and divorce. That's why he said to Adam before sex was ever introduced, multiply to replenish the earth. When he was yet in the beginning, when he was yet both male and female in himself, there shows then that the bride has got to come from the word by spiritual multiplication. Multiplication replenish the earth. How? Through Mary's seed does he replenish the earth? Because those that can believe his word in their day. He comes with the quickening power to quicken that original seed down in the soul to life. And when it's quickened to life, it's another son of God again upon the earth. And now through Mary's seed, he's replenishing the earth. And he's doing it now, friends. &gt;&gt; What was given at the original when the first woman failed, he brought back the natural original seed. He brought it through a womb of a woman. Amen. And now through the spiritual womb of a woman. He's bringing forth now the replenishing of the earth. &gt;&gt; It's in spoken word as the original seed. When brother Benham gets down to this, he gets to this part and he starts to say, he starts to tell us some examples of the Bible and he says the Ethiopian unic in the book of Acts, he had went up to Jerusalem. He went to the doctors of divinity and the PhDs and tried to get it through education and he come back reading Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as he was reading Isaiah, God, Amen, called Philillip away from a revival in Samaria, told him to go to the wilderness. And when this chariot come by, he told him, he said, "Draw yourself up to the chariot." He ran alongside. He heard him reading out of the book of Isaiah. He says, "Do that do you understand what you read?" And he says, "How can I lest some man show me?" &gt;&gt; And he stopped the chariot. Philip climbed up in. And beginning at that scripture, he preached unto them Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And what did the man said? Here's water. What does hinder me to be baptized? And he baptized him. As soon as he baptized him, Philip disappeared and was gone. &gt;&gt; Why? Listen, why uh brother Bam starts to teach this principle of spiritual multiplication? Why is a replenishing the earth through a spiritual new birth? New birth. Birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back to the original commandment, friends. This goes all the way back to the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This Bible isn't 66 books. This Bible isn't a collection of stories. This Bible isn't fairy tales and stories pieced together. This is one thought God had and one desire that he had and the whole story is bringing it right back in a redemption cycle back to his original plan. Multiply and replenish the earth be a god race upon this earth. &gt;&gt; And now he's accomplishing it through spiritual multiplication. And he says,"Wh if the angel of the Lord could tell Philillip &gt;&gt; to go to the wilderness and draw alongside, why couldn't the angel of the Lord just go to the Ethiopian unic?" &gt;&gt; Think about it, friends. &gt;&gt; He says, "Because the seed has got to be transferred from one life to the other." And he said, "Where is his seed?" He said his seed is in his body. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said where is my seed? Said my seed is in my body. Brother William Brandham's children came from him. Amen. And now where is the seed of Christ? It's in his body which is the bride. Amen. And listen, brother Brandham comes to the end of his ministry and he starts laying it down and he says the truth of this is in her and her alone. This seed life is only in the bride in the end time. The denomination system has ceased. He's done working with it. Amen. He's brought his life back through the opening of the word and the seven seal and placed it back in her and it's in her alone and she alone stands with it. &gt;&gt; Back to a virgin wound, back to reproduce Christ. &gt;&gt; Then he goes to another story. I love it. Then he goes to Peter going to Cornelius's house. &gt;&gt; He said God came to him. An angel came to him in a dream and in the dream told him, "What you need to do &gt;&gt; is you need to go send somebody for Simon Peter. He's in Simon the Tanner's house in a city called Jap." I mean, this is detailed information. &gt;&gt; Give him his address and who he's staying with. And I mean, told him all this. Go in there and he'll tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; Listen. So, he sent for Peter. Peter came. He was a bit reluctant, but God had to show him in a vision of the sheet set down. Don't don't call unclean what I've called clean. And so he went, even with reluctance, he went to Cornelius's house and began to preach the word. And as he began to preach the word, the Holy Ghost fell on them. Amen. The same as it did on the day of Pentecost. And he says, "How can we prevent them that from water?" Amen. Seeing they receive the Holy Ghost the same as we. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham takes the story and he says if the angel could tell Cornelius where to find Peter and then he why couldn't he tell him the way of salvation? Why couldn't he preach him Christ? He said because the life has got to come from the body. It comes transverse from the body of Christ. Amen. Into another predestinated seed and it brings forth another son of God through spiritual multiplication. &gt;&gt; This is what the seed of Mary's been doing for 2,000 years. Then he goes to another story. Then brother, he goes, "Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses, let everything be established. Let every word." Now he comes to Paul the apostle. He was solid this time persecuting the church, &gt;&gt; wreaking havoc at the church. Gets letters from Damascus to go down to the church and wreak some havoc there and hail them prisoner and haul them to prison and and break up their assemblies. And on the way down, he meets a pillar of fire. He meets the pillar of fire. Not a pillar of fire, the pillar of fire. And he asked the pillar of fire, "Who are you?" Because there was a voice that spoke out of it. And he said, "I am Jesus whom you persecute." &gt;&gt; So who is Paul talking to? He's talking to Jesus Christ back in pillar of fire form like he was before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is Jesus tell him? &gt;&gt; Go into the city and wait. &gt;&gt; I will send somebody to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God goes to Ananas said, "Listen, Ananas, I need you to do something for me. There's this Saul. I want you to go to him. I I He He's a chosen vessel. He's predestinated. He's mine, but he's got to make contact with the living word. He's got to come in physical contact with the living word for his day because he's got to be born again." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Ananas protest. Lord, you you know, you know this guy. You know, I've heard a lot of things like you're giving God information, you know. You may not have heard God, but I've heard. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go thy way, Ananas, for he's a chosen vessel unto me." And Ananas goes in and lays hands on Paul. Amen. God has sent me. And God opens his eyes. He's filled with the Holy Ghost. He's baptized in Jesus' name. Amen. Why? Why? If if if Paul is talking to Jesus Christ in the pillar of fire, he's asking him, "Who are you, Lord?" He's saying, "I am Jesus." They're having a conversation. Why wouldn't Jesus himself in pillar of fire form tell him because life has to come through his body on the earth and his body on the earth was the church? And he just proved it to Paul because Paul never touched Jesus Christ in the flesh. Never brought a persecution against him. But he was persecuting the church. And Jesus says, "Why are you persecuting me?" So when Ananas came to him, that was Christ's body &gt;&gt; coming to him. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram uses these three examples to show us that since the seed of Mary has come, he's made a way to replenish the earth again with sons and daughters of God. And now he's not doing it through first birth. That's been corrupted. That's why he had to be virgin born because the first birth was corrupted. Now there has to be a spiritual birth, a new birth. And now through the new birth, he's bringing the spiritual multiplication to replenish the earth to bring sons and daughters forth upon this earth. &gt;&gt; And the life has to go from his body to others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like Mary bringing the promised word for her day to Elizabeth and Elizabeth was a dormant part of the word in her springs to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing that happened to you and I friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody with the word alive in them come to us &gt;&gt; and shared the gospel, testified of the word for our day. And when it did, something inside of us come to life and begin to leap and jump. And &gt;&gt; what was it? It was that predestinated life thing there. Praise be to God. I get so excited. &gt;&gt; Oh, what are we going to do now? Let's just start back at the beginning and start reading again. We want You want to go back to page one? No, let's turn to page. Let's go to page three now. We haven't made it this far yet. &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, I thought we'd read through this in one service and enjoy it and love it, but I'm enjoying it real good. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the answer to brother Brandham's question. This is what his dilemma was. I got him out on a limb. The church is finished. No more church systems. The denominations are over. God's not going to use it. What's the answer? This is the answer. Come back to the original seed, the original word, the original life. &gt;&gt; That's the answer. Now he goes top of page three. Notice the harmony of the father and the son. Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father. John 5:19. This harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride. He shows her his word of life. She receives it. She never doubts it. &gt;&gt; Almost pause, please. When you say she never doubts it, that doesn't mean the devil can't put questions in your mind. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of what Hebrews says of Abraham. Hebrews speaks of Abraham and says, "He staggered not at the promise of God, but drew strong in faith." &gt;&gt; But go back and read the book of Genesis. &gt;&gt; Looked like maybe, you know, there was some misunderstanding. Not maybe necessarily doubt. He believed the word of God, but how it would come to pass and all of that. There there was a bit Hey, listen. In our lives, there can be a bit of misstep and a bit of misunderstanding. But it doesn't matter. We're not doubting the word. That seed inside of us believes every bit of that word. &gt;&gt; We may get confused in our minds. We may make a misstep here or there or go on a detour once in a while, but it doesn't matter. The the the real believing is that seed down on the inside. He shows her his word of life. How did he show us the word of life? through a prophetic ministry in the end time. He has showed us his word of life. He has taken the veil off the Bible. He has opened the seven seals. Amen. When the prophet got through with that, he said, "My Bible's become a new book." Why? The veil has been taken off of the book. He shows her his word of life. She receives it. &gt;&gt; This is so simple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He unveils it. She receives it. &gt;&gt; And she never doubts it. Therefore, &gt;&gt; circle therefore. &gt;&gt; Therefore is joining two thoughts together. The previous thought with the next thought. So what is the previous thought? The previous thought is he shows her his word of life. He's done that through the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She receives it. We've done that by faith. She never doubts it because she's predestinated to believe. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not even death. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing. Remember Jesus looked at his disciples, he said, "Nothing shall ever hurt thee." &gt;&gt; Nothing by shall by any means harm thee. And they looked at his disciples. Almost every one of them died a martyr's death except John. What does he mean nothing shall harm you? Because the real you is not this here. This is going to be made over again. But now that you've come to the reality of who you are, you've been born again by the spirit of God. Amen. You've received the word for your day. There is nothing ever going to harm you again. You were born harmed. You were born in darkness. You were born Amen. You were born a a backslider, a sinner. You were born in a sin flesh body. But praise be to God, once you've come to this realization, once he's opened the word to you and you receive it and you never doubt it, nothing will ever harm you again. Not even death. &gt;&gt; Because you can't die. Eternal life is is living inside. For if the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. What seed? The spoken word is the original seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he comes back and plants the original Listen, when Oh, all right. Bear with me for a minute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Follow this thought through. Brother Brandham comes and he and he and he and he ties together all the loosens from the church ages to bring back the correct teaching, the correct doctrine, the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But after that, he comes to the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; And after he comes to the opening of the seals, he comes to the seven seal mystery. And he comes and he starts preaching it. And Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And when he gets to Christ and mystery of God revealed, he says, listen, he says there's been one thing in the whole Bible, one goal that God has had through the entire Bible. And every character in the Bible's been typing it and one thing that he's been trying to achieve in the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; So he comes back. He comes back and he takes everything that's been taught, the church ages, the understanding, the history, who Israel is, who who the gentile bride is, who Christ, and he ties it all together. And in the opening of the seals, he takes the veil off of redemption. Then he comes to the seventh seal, and he says, "Really, there's only been one thing in God's mind he wanted to achieve." &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram's not talking about doctrines &gt;&gt; because every doctrine is to point to this truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. everyone godhead, water, babes, name, serpent, sea, they're all to point to this truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, and he's unfolded it in a three-fold manner. &gt;&gt; One to get preeminence in a man. He did that in Christ Jesus. Now, to get preeminence in the people. He's doing that now. And to restore back Eden. &gt;&gt; What's it all about? It's all about God's original desire. multiply and replenish and bring forth me &gt;&gt; as a family on this earth. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And when God comes to the end of the message in the end of the messenger, he wraps it up with this thought that it's all about him wanting to manifest himself in people &gt;&gt; and flesh upon the earth and to live together as a family of God upon the earth. And that's what this whole Bible is about. If the seed be planted, the water will raise it up again. Here's the secret of this. The word is in the bride as it was in Mary. The bride has the mind of Christ, for she knows what he once done with the word. She performs the command of the word in his name, for she has thus saith the Lord. When the word is quickened by the then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose. How does she get the word? How does she know what thus sayeth the Lord on the word is because of a prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; Because the word she knows for sure what this word means and what the interpretation of it is because it's been given to her by a son of man ministry. Thus sayaeth the Lord, the word is quickened by the spirit, comes to pass like a seed that's been planted, watered, it comes the full harvest serving its purpose. This is the time for the full display of the word. &gt;&gt; He says, uh, now let's go. Let's let's look at this quote here. Paragraph 244. As Adam found his wife pregnant with the seed of death, as Satan's lie, she had accepted. Joseph found his wife pregnant with the seed of God, which is the word she accepted. What are we pregnant by? This word that we've accepted, which is Christ. It's the finishing of the mystery of God. It's what God had in his mind all along. It's the one thing that he wanted to achieve. It's his great plan through it all. And she has received that seed. When you re when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing, there's nothing in the world is going to defeat you in it. That's all. You're absolutely undefeable. Not you, but God that's in you. &gt;&gt; Not not not Christ, not not the body, but this the word that was in him. Not Mary, but the word that was born from her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I want to stop here for a minute and think about Mary. Mary received the word from a me messenger said, "Be it unto me according to your word." That word, that word now took its place, its resting place in her womb and began to build cell upon cell upon cell. And it was building the body, amen, that Jehovah was going to dwell in upon this earth, the son of God. And as it was building, amen, it was taking over Mary's life. And listen, this word inside of her and her being a part of that word and carrying the predestinated word, amen, and and bringing it forth. Amen. Because of that, her life was now caught up in something so much bigger than she could ever dream. She was now a central figure in the Bible. Amen. And that being part of that word and having that living word inside of her now was directing her life, was directing everything about her life. Listen, she was in Nazareth, a spouse to a man to be married, but God injected himself there. Anyways, he talked to Joseph to so Joseph wouldn't put her away. Listen, Mary didn't have any explaining to do. Mary didn't have to defend herself. Mary had already said, "Be unto me according to your word." Whatever happened now, the Christ was living in her. So, God had to make provision for her. God had to go to Joseph, not Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had to convince Joseph, not Mary, because now she's carrying the word. and God has got to watch over her life. And now there's prophecies that must be fulfilled in her life. And one of those prophecies is that this baby has to be born in the city of David. Well, Mary may not even even understood that. Mary may have heard and been read through I mean the scriptures and it never dawned on her that that was part of the word for her day, but it didn't need to dawn on her because it never left the mind of God. And she was part of the program of God. And God was going to work his program because his life was now injected inside of her. And she didn't have to figure it out. God was going to figure it out. If God had to move the heart of kings, he had to move nations. He had to move people in a census all over the world. Hey, listen. This was a worldwide census. &gt;&gt; God was moving politics. God was moving armies. God was moving uh laws, senators. He was moving What was he moving it for? Because there was a prophecy. Amen. that this baby has to come from the city of David and if he's got to raise up another emperor in Rome and that emperor gets suddenly a brainstorm one day all of his advisers around him might say you're nuts this is going to be so much work why are we doing this the Senate may have broke out in fights they may have threatened his life then everybody around the world in the in the habitated world at that point now they're all disrupted and everybody has to go back to their city of origin and people are moving all over the place so much so when they got to Bethlehem the ends were full there was no place to Today, people are dispersed. Amen. The the whole world is probably grinding their teeth and seething about &gt;&gt; who this emperor was. &gt;&gt; And it all happened because she had the word inside of her. And she didn't have to figure anything out. She didn't have to lift a finger to move it. God was moving it. Friend, we don't have to understand how God's going to do what he's going to do in the end time. all the prophecies that brother Brandham laid down. It's you be sure it's going to happen if he's got to raise up kings and knock them down and move nations and start fights and change the whole structure of the world. He's going to change it to bring forth what he promised to bring forth in this age. It'll happen just as sure as you're here. It's going to happen, friends. And you don't have to figure it out. You don't have to join conspiracy theories. You don't have to probe the internet for hours and listen to people sitting in their basement telling you what the government's doing. Forget about it all and stay with this word. Read the message. Listen to the tapes. Stay in your Bible. Stay in prayer. And stop roaming around the internet trying to figure out how God's going to bring to pass what brother prophesied. Cuz every time you get it wrong, every time. &gt;&gt; God never asked Mary to be smart. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never asked Mary to figure out the conspiracy. &gt;&gt; You know how many conspiracies were floating around when Caesar decided to tax the whole world? &gt;&gt; But we know what the conspiracy was. And for us, it's not a theory. It's the truth. God had to get that woman from Nazareth to Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And he disrupted the whole world to do it. &gt;&gt; God's got to get you to manifest the full life of Jesus Christ. And if he's got to disrupt my life, your life, and everyone around us, he'll disrupt it all to have that manifestation. &gt;&gt; Everything he said would happen will happen. &gt;&gt; Boycott, gold system, whatever, it's all going to happen. But I it's not up to me to figure out how. Do you think Mary was sitting there one day and somebody come and said, "Mary, I saw this scripture where we got to go to Bethl." No. &gt;&gt; And then what does she do? Tell Caesar to bring a worldwide taxation. How many connections do you have in government? &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we're supposed to do except believe the word and surrender to the headship of Christ. Let the spirit of God run our lives and stop using all our thinking. &gt;&gt; Just stick with the word and let the spirit of God move us. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I've said it before, we'll say it again. Joseph might have been complaining all along the way. He probably didn't understand what was happening, but here he's got a hugely pregnant wife. She's uncomfortable. They probably had already made preparations, you know, for Nazareth. And now all of a sudden, this has come up and ruined all their plans. And they got to take this cross-country trip. And they're going down, and the baby could come any minute. And Joseph is probably not saying nice things about Caesar. &gt;&gt; And then when they get to Bethlehem and all the doors of the ends are closed, I'm sure he had other thoughts in his mind. &gt;&gt; But God was orchestrating every step perfect in line with his predestinated will and plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And friends, we ain't got a thing to worry about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All we've got to do is say, "Lord, I believe." &gt;&gt; Amen. be it unto me according to your word or your will. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to erase all of my own thinking and my predetermined plans of how you're going to do it. I want it to vanish out of my mind and I just want you to have your way with me. Oh, praise God, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next paragraph. Those in the bride do only his will. &gt;&gt; Amen. No one can make them do otherwise. They have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works, fulfilling his own word. Let's read that slowly. &gt;&gt; Yes. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do we know that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should know that. We need to know that. We need to know it every minute of the day that it has to be God in us fulfilling his word, doing his works, fulfilling his own word. He did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says again spoke word. Now this body is to do the same because the body is the head and body is together. That's right. Christ is the head was the word. His body has to be the same thing as his head was. That's right. A church of the word, born of the word, virgin born from the word, not denomination now. Virgin born from the word. The way the body operates is by the head. She can do nothing except what the headship of the word is already said. And if she doesn't understand what to do, she's going to keep still until she gets thus sayeth the Lord. And thus sayeth the Lord is the word that has been revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. until she understands she's not going to press forward presuming anymore. That's what got every other bride in trouble was presuming. But this bride is not going to move forward presuming. She's just going to hold steady and let God figure it out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've seen enough history down through the Bible to realize that we can't go back to human reasoning. We can't go back to figuring things out. We're going to have to hold steady with what God's given us and wait for God to open the door. Wait for God to rescue. Wait for God to bring revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he works his plan through his body. He's the headship come this in this age unite with the body so that he can get full control of the body so that he can finish the work that he left for this time. He says now watch remember God's law of reproduction. God's law of reproduction remember after its kind. That's right. The seed of Christ the word must come through the body. Are you getting tired? All right, just a minute now. Let's just hold quiet and pray. I want to get this in real good. I want this to grind down. The seed of Christ must mu s must come through his body. Not through a denomination, but through a bornaged seed of the word must come through. Now remember what is it? Christ's seed. How does my seed come? Through the body. How does the apple tree seed come? Through the body. Seed is through the body. And the church is the body of Christ. That's right. The Bible church the birth produces that's the new birth himself in body Christ in you the hope of glory &gt;&gt; his church is his word so that the people can see the confirmation of Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever &gt;&gt; next paragraph she knows that what does she know that he didn't complete all his work in his earthly ministry So now he works in and through the bride. She knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. He must now do. He didn't say she must now do. I think we got the point now. &gt;&gt; He must now do. But he will. I like that little word now. fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time. Do you believe he'll do it? &gt;&gt; You think he's going to do it, you know, because you're smart, because you're strong? Because you got it all figured out? No. He's going to do it. But what does he need? He needs the same thing he did in his first earthly ministry. He needed somebody who would believe him. &gt;&gt; He needed the same thing he needed with Abraham. somebody that would believe his word. He needed the same thing he's always needed. Somebody on this earth who would believe him and receive the word for the hour they live in to let that word manifest through him. That's what he had in Noah. That's what he had in David and Jeremiah and Moses. He had in each one of them. He had somebody who would receive the word for their day, believe it, and let it manifest through them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's going to do in this day. Brother says, 'When the Methodists failed, God raised up others. And so it was gone on through the years until this last day. There is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She is now the mouthpiece of God. God is using her to speak the word to bring spiritual multiplication upon the earth. What is it she's speaking? Not her thoughts, &gt;&gt; not her mind, her his word. That's what she's speaking. And that's why he says those under their messenger because our messenger was the prophet that God sent to this day to restore the word. And through that messenger, amen, he brought back the headstone Christ, the fullness of the word with the full life and united to unite with a body. And now that headship is now the headship that's directing the body. Amen. That's why this bride must stay under the messenger. Yes, &gt;&gt; we can't outprofit the prophet. We can't out know, brother Brandon. We can't do those things, friend. Because if you do, we're going to get ourselves all twisted up and mess up like every other church has messed up. But God already sent through his voice, restored his word in full measure and brought everything we need in the message. And we got to stay under that headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we don't stay under, if we feel ourselves equal to or above and know things better than he knew or listen, we can't do that, friends. And the minute we do that, we're going down the same old path that every church age has gone down. &gt;&gt; We got to stay under because this we've got the word. The word was given to us through a prophetic ministry of thus sayeth the Lord on the word through a prophetic ministry and shall have thus sayeth the Lord or she'll keep still. And if we didn't see it and we don't understand it through the message, then just keep still. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let God bring his word to pass. &gt;&gt; I want to finish with this last quote. proving his word. And Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, now watch close. In the days of Sodom, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man, when the Son of Man is being revealed. Not no more as a church. See, not no more the bride is called." See, in that day the Son of Man will be revealed. What? To join the church to the head, unite the marriage of the bride. The bridegroom call will come right through this. When the son of man will come down and come in human flesh, what human flesh is he referring to? &gt;&gt; It's referring his. &gt;&gt; He was a son of man, revealing the son of man, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just like in Sodom, what happened in Sodom? God came down in human flesh, turned his back to the tent, and discerned Sarah's thoughts behind it. God did the same thing in our day. &gt;&gt; To join the church today, unite the marriage of the bride. The bridegroom call will come right through this. When the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together, the church has to be the word. He is the word and the two unites together. And to do that, it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. &gt;&gt; The son of man is the prophetic ministry of Jesus Christ on earth. &gt;&gt; And that was replicated through brother Brandham's ministry. It was Jesus Christ using that tabernacle to show us, I'm here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, not a clergyman. Oh, don't I don't know. I do. You see what I mean? It's son of man. Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one, the bride. And then she'll go home to the wedding supper. Amen. She's already united. See, we go to the wedding supper, not the marriage. Fill your flesh self with the flesh of mighty men cuz the marriage of the lamb has come. But the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they two become one. And then what does it do then? It manifests the son of man again. Not the church theologians. The son of man. The word and the church becomes one. Whatever the son of man done, he was the word. The church does the same thing. This message came to make the word so real to unite the bride on earth with the heavenly bridegroom to unite the two together so that she becomes one with the word so that the word has a place to live through in her and what will do it'll reproduce his life again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go all the way back to the first page. I want to read something in the middle of the first page, right dead center of our little booklet. In the last days, the true bride church, Christ's seed, will come to the headstone, which is him. That's the marriage. When the headstone comes to the body, and she will be the super church, a super race as she nears him. What super race? What super church? Listen, I'm going slow and I'm whispering because I could get so excited we could take off like a rocket right now. What did God want originally upon this earth? A super race. &gt;&gt; What was a super race? God in flesh. &gt;&gt; There's a super race. &gt;&gt; Amen. God brought Adam. He brought Adam's wife, told him to replenish, fill the earth with the Christ seed, but they failed. But God brought back his seed through a virgin womb of Mary. And when he come back, what was he? He was the super seed. He was the head of the super race. He was the beginning of the creation of God. What was he? He was the super seed. God in human flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, and through that he brought back the multiplication of replenishing the earth. In the end, when the headship, the word unites with the body, she will be a super church. Listen, what makes her a super church? We can have all kinds of ideas and there's some things a lot of things brother Ben Brandham said but what makes her a super church is because the super one is now living inside of her &gt;&gt; and she has his potentials. &gt;&gt; Meaning there's nothing that is impossible to those that believe. She's become a super church cuz the super life, the original life, the original seed, the original word, the original everything has come back into bride form now. And she's the pregnantated daughter of God. She's the pregnant wife of Jesus Christ. And now whatever God wants, he can bring through that body because he's super because the super God is now dwelling in his people. &gt;&gt; What makes her a super race? So what is the super race? The super race is the God race, the Christ seed. God in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; We think of super church and super race. we immediately go to supernatural things and supernatural signs. Listen, all of that is possible. It was showed in the in the messenger that was sent to us. Brother Baron was the first part of that harvest to come to maturity. And he showed he could create through that vessel. He could speak to storms and they would listen. He could create squirrels where there was no squirrels. He had control over nature. He could create. He could speak to tumors. God could use him to do all to bring back life to open blinded eyes to do everything. What was it? He was showing that we're coming to the super race. It's all there. She has his potentials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what makes this a super race is with all the potentials and all the life and the super life inside of her, she has thus sayeth the Lord or she keeps still. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's under the control of the headship. And whatever the headship wants to do as he moves down into the body, he can do it all. And there's a people on this earth that can believe it all. Amen. When he was here the first time, Amen. Peter walked on water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus walked on water, broke loaves and fish, healed the dead, opened blinded eyes. It happened again in our day, friends. And God is there's nothing that's limiting now. Nothing is limiting this bride. She's a super church, a super race because the super life of Jesus Christ is now living in her. She's been married to the super one. And now through a super life in her, she's the super church. She's coming back to the super race through spiritual multiplication. And she can do the super works. &gt;&gt; But she's not going to do them herself. She's going to do them because he's doing it in her. Cuz he will fulfill the portion he left for this day. It'll be him and her. But it takes her surrendering to him. And it takes somebody that'll say, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; What's the good of having superpower and super church and a super race if the people it's in don't believe it's possible? We got to believe it's possible, friend. that there's nothing that'll hinder God. There's no limitations to the power and life of God that has been released to the bride in this age. &gt;&gt; And when God needs to, he'll do it. When he wants to, he'll do it. He just needs somebody who will believe him. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God never did super duper things cuz he felt like it. &gt;&gt; When he did the super duper things, it was because his headship told him to. &gt;&gt; And under the direction of the headship, he believed it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it happened. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can't fret, friends. There's no more fretting. &gt;&gt; My soul does magnify the Lord. &gt;&gt; For he's looked on the lowest state of his handmaiden. He has brought down those who are high, but he's lifted us up, friends, and my soul does magnify the Lord. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of times we don't feel like a super church, &gt;&gt; but we don't care about feelings anymore. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't feel like a super race. Listen, the super race is not what goes on between our ears and not what we do with the work of our hands. The super race is the life of God quickening the seed inside of us. Christ bringing life to the sons of daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's the super race. And one day it's going to manifest itself in full when that life is on this earth again with Christ when he sets up his millennial kingdom. Listen, these bodies are going to change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to go back from hybrid to original. Inside, we've come to original. Outside, we're coming back to original. Friends, &gt;&gt; let's all stand. &gt;&gt; To fulfill what? God's original desire. &gt;&gt; All of this is about his original desire. It was interrupted. But the book of redemption is about bringing back his original desire. musicians, if you could come and brother Blake, if you could come. Let's just bow our heads together. Dear heavenly father, we thank you, Lord. God, the things that we talk about, the things that you've shared with us through your prophet, they're so real to us, Lord. They resonate inside. But God, and in our human thinking, they seem so impossible. God, what you have done, like you did in Mary, like you did in Elizabeth, like you've done in David, like you did in Moses, like you've done through all of your children down through time, through fishermen and tax collectors. God, you've been able to take vessels and fill them with your power and use them for your glory. And God, we believe what your prophet has taught in this end time. Lord, you're coming back to unite with your bride and you're going to manifest yourself as a many membered body in bride form. But God, we know that it has to be you fulfilling your word. We know that it has to be you doing the work that you left for this specific time and you'll do it in and through the bride. Lord, it's not us. It's not our works. It's not our ability. We have none, Lord. But it's your mind, your word, your strength, your power, your spirit. And God, we just surrender to it. You who could take Mary and you could fulfill your promise through her. Lord, you can take us and you can fulfill your promise through us. God, I pray that you would give us greater faith, Lord, than we've ever had before. Take the eyes and wash our eyes clean. May we perceive all that you're doing in this hour. And God, may we realize what super thing you're doing in this hour with a superpower that's released by a super word that's brought back the original seed life. Lord, we're so thankful. God, we want to surrender to you in greater ways, Lord. God, help us to relax and allow you to take control. Help us to surrender our thinking and our own ambitions and our own goals and lay them all down at your feet. Lord, there's nothing in this hour that can compare to this truth. Lord, for this is the transition that you brought the prophet to. That the church systems are dead, but now you're calling forth a bride. Lord, the first virgin failed, so you brought another. Lord, the first church failed, so now you're bringing back another. and we believe by your grace that we're part of that. Lord, now we're just saying, Lord, have your way in me. I surrender to you. Give us the faith to believe that all things are possible. May we realize there's no hindrances, Lord, to this word. There's no obstacles that you won't overcome. There's nothing that can defeat your purpose. And if your purpose in us, then there's nothing that can defeat us because it's your purpose in us. There's nothing that will stop this prophecy from coming forth. There's nothing to stop you from fulfilling your word. You've already set it in motion. And may we believe in the impossible. May we believe in all things. May we keep moving forward with joy, Lord, and rest in our hearts and an excitement about what you're doing because everything is possible because the headship is here working in the body. May we be your hands and your mouth and your eyes and your feet. Whatever part you want us to be, may we play it, Lord. May we surrender to you and may your headship, your word, the the truth that you've restored to us, may it guide our every step and our every motion. And Lord, teach us when we're unsure to be still. Teach us, Lord, not to feel the pressure of figuring out or moving forward, but help us to be able to rest under your headship and trust you as our husband. That you will reveal when the time is right. You will show when we need to see and you will move in us when it's time to move. While we love you, we ask your blessing upon us, Lord. I bless your blessing upon all your people. And may your word move forward unhindered by unbelief. May the faith that you've granted to us to believe take center stage in our lives. And may we yield to it in all things. We ask for your blessings. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. flashlight. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start.
