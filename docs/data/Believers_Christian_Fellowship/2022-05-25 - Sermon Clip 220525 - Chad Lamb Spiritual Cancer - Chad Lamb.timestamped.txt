[0:00] i mean jesus could look with compassion
[0:02] on the crowd that was rejecting him
[0:03] hating him wagging their head at him
[0:05] because he understood what they went
[0:07] through
[0:09] and when we can get this kind of healing
[0:12] till we can look at the perpetrators of
[0:14] our hurt the ones who wounded us the
[0:16] most and say father i forgive them
[0:18] completely and i feel sorry for them
[0:21] they if they weren't hurt they wouldn't
[0:23] have hurt me this way
[0:25] if they hadn't been misled if they
[0:27] hadn't been deceived if they hadn't been
[0:28] abused if they hadn't been neglected
[0:30] they would have never done this to me
[0:33] and when you get down to that where
[0:35] brother brown says i got to go i can't
[0:36] go feeling the ricky regettas i got to
[0:39] go feeling the children of god that are
[0:40] caught in bondage
[0:42] and i can't go the rest of my life
[0:44] feeling like everybody's antichrist and
[0:46] everybody
[0:48] i can't live the rest of my life with
[0:50] everybody who disagrees with me
[0:51] doctrinally believing that they're
[0:53] antichrists and they're rickies and
[0:54] rickettis you've got to believe that
[0:56] they're children of god but they're in
[0:58] their own bondage man they're children
[0:59] of god with their own blindness they're
[1:01] children of god and have a feeling for
[1:03] the people again even the people have
[1:05] hurt you
[1:07] amen that is the power of christ that's
[1:10] the power of the spirit of god working
[1:12] in our life and purging out all that the
[1:15] devil has tried to sow in and it'll come
[1:17] when the stream of the word keeps
[1:19] flowing in your heart
[1:20] and pumping out all the impurities
[1:25] i'll tell you you don't have to live
[1:28] locked up shut down hurt stuck in the
[1:31] past dragging around an old ball and
[1:34] chain from childhood you don't have to
[1:36] live that way
[1:37] christ came
[1:39] to heal the broken heart
[1:41] and to set at liberty those that are
[1:43] bruised
[1:46] i say thank god
[1:48] it's not time to keep something stuffed
[1:50] this is time to bring it out and say god
[1:52] i need help with this
[1:54] this is time to let the revelation of
[1:56] the word amen expose say nothing
[1:59] happened in the life of a believer
[2:01] unless it first crossed god's desk and
[2:02] if god signed off on it i needed it for
[2:05] something and i'm thankful that it
[2:06] happened in my life
[2:08] let that revelation start to bring the
[2:10] healing process because that's nothing
[2:12] but the truth if you are a predestinated
[2:14] elect seed of god god knew what you
[2:16] would go through and god allowed it
[2:18] because it serves his purpose somehow
[2:20] and it's for your good right
[2:23] and when you can catch that revelation
[2:25] and say god i am thankful that you
[2:28] allowed this to happen for the lesson
[2:29] i'll learn and the help that i can be to
[2:31] somebody else now god i believe it i
[2:34] accept it now all my thinking is wrong i
[2:36] reject it but i need some help with the
[2:39] leftover residual pain would you come
[2:41] now and heal my wounded heart
[2:44] if you stay
[2:45] in the washing of the water of the word
[2:49] word by word
[2:51] scripture by scripture
[2:53] sermon by sermon he'll take all the
[2:55] impurities out
[2:57] until you're completely free
[2:59] free to trust
[3:01] free to love
[3:02] free to engage
[3:04] free to embrace
[3:06] free
[3:07] to not just receive but free to give
[3:11] that's how god wants us to live
