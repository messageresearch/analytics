Well, considered a real privilege to be here this morning and I told Brother Chad just as soon have him stand here, but he wouldn't take any suggestions and he wouldn't do it. So, and I'm not just being facitious, but I I really uh I've struggled even though the Lord gave me something a few days ago when he called. I You know how it is. you don't feel you're worthy at all. So, I'm going to have you take your seat just for a moment. I want to read something something I wrote down quite a while ago. And I want you to listen to the words. You'll never know the mind of God until we learn to know the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Because out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. It doesn't come from here. &gt;&gt; It comes from here. &gt;&gt; You don't think, you think from your heart. The true believer thinks from his heart. When you were saved, you were saved the moment you believed. And you will be healed the moment you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no questioning whether you know whether you're saved or not because you were saved by faith &gt;&gt; and that not of yourselves. &gt;&gt; God's gift came and proved it to you that you are saved by the word of God, by the power of God. So your healing comes the same way. You have to believe. &gt;&gt; May it be a revelation this morning. The word of God that's been brought in our day. May it be quickened to your soul. &gt;&gt; Are you saved this morning? &gt;&gt; I'm saved. &gt;&gt; Are you saved? &gt;&gt; Then God quickened something in your soul. Cuz it's not here that you're saved. It's here that you're saved. &gt;&gt; You're a new creature in Christ Jesus. Now in casting out sickness which is demons we know we have to be careful about who gives the command. Man may say come out of that person but unless his command is by the spirit of God his words are useless. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man can say, "Well, come out." But unless the Holy Ghost is doing it, the words are useless. &gt;&gt; We're going to have some thoughts this morning that might just shake you up a little bit. But sometimes we need that, don't we? &gt;&gt; How many believe that we need a revival in our own selves? &gt;&gt; We need to be revived in the spirit. I know when you were filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it was wonderful. But how about this morning? &gt;&gt; Where do you stand this morning with the Holy Ghost? I trust with all my heart that you have settled the question in your heart. And if there's anyone here this morning, I want to just say, God bless you. Listen to the word. Not brother Jim. Listen to the word. And may it be a blessing. Not only that, but a transforming power that you'll never ever walk out of here again not knowing what you have. You have the Holy Ghost in. That is a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the Holy Ghost is a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's one more thing I want to say. Never compare this book. This is the Bible right here with other books. &gt;&gt; The Bible is from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does not contain the word of God. It is the word of God. &gt;&gt; That is God's word in form, &gt;&gt; written form. So if you want something from God, it's right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please stand. We'll go to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd like to speak on spiritual ignition. &gt;&gt; Spiritual ignition. I told brother Shad when I only need five or 10 minutes anyway. But you know when when he calls and I I went in and tried to comb the few hairs I have left. And I was standing there and I'm looking at that and all of a sudden the word came to me. ignite. And I said, "Lord, I'm ignited every time I hear the prophet or every time I hear in church. There's an ignition that happens. &gt;&gt; But it isn't the kind that starts a fire. It is a fire in my soul." But it's the spiritual ignition. And I believe this morning, we need to receive a little bit of spiritual ignition. &gt;&gt; You go camping, you'll never ever start a fire without oxygen, fuel, and spark. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I could go. Brother Bram said everything in the natural types is spiritual. &gt;&gt; So what we've got is the oxygen is the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; The fuel is the word &gt;&gt; and the spark is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; if we could just catch those three things this morning, &gt;&gt; the spark is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And if you got the spark of the Holy Ghost in you, let me tell you something. There's going to be a fire started real quick &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost is the power and the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you will to Ephesians the 4th chapter. Ephesians 4. So appreciated the message on Wednesday. And uh I know he took some scriptures that I was just thrilled to hear. And we'll never even touch anything that that was said as far as adding to. But I I want to just let you know that the Lord laid this on my heart and and I trust it'll be a blessing to you. Ephesians the 4th chapter I want to begin reading just we know this the scripture but verse 12 for the perfecting of the saints that's you for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in a unity the unity of the faith &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Heavenly Father, we bow before you this morning with grateful hearts and wonder Lord sometimes how you can come on the scene and take just an old sinner boy and people that have gone to terrible places in the past and then they're washed clean by the blood of the lamb and they stand here as trophies of your grace. We don't have anything in ourselves, Lord, but we depend totally on your spirit. Will you come and take all of our thoughts, lay them aside, Lord, and speak to the soul. That's the real person. It's not the body. It is the soul. That's the temple of the Holy Ghost. Would you speak to it? We pray this morning. We want to give you all the praise and glory in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. We'll never attain to perfection. So it's not our perfection that scriptur is talking about. When brother Brandon preached perfect faith, it's always him in you that is perfect. &gt;&gt; So if you're looking to be perfect, it's not going to happen. We fail every day. He never fails. Amen. &gt;&gt; So perfect is actually perfect faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; And as long as it's out there in the &gt;&gt; whatever ether or whatever and just words or intellectual conception of it isn't going to change anything in here. But the true perfect faith of the Holy Ghost equips you and ignites you with the fire of the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to read something here that remember brother Brandham talked about have the faith of God. Well, faith is a gift. We know that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Galatians tells us, "For by grace are we saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God." So, we establish right away this morning, faith is a gift. And if a father ever feels the need to give a gift to one of his children, he's not going to just take an old cruddy looking rope or a stained garment or whatever. He wants to give his child the absolute best, whatever it comes in, whatever form. And because it's a gift, it actually represents his very character. So when God gives a gift of faith, it's his character. Actually, it's actually God himself in that gift that he's giving you. &gt;&gt; So it isn't just a gift. I remember when I was a boy, I my father died when I was three years old. So mom married and I had a stepfather that um I loved him, but one son, one Christmas time, uh you know how little boys get so excited about Christmas? At least this little boy did. still a little boy. I guess that's why I love the young people so much. And thank you brothers for helping the move yesterday. That was precious. Precious. And so I'm there close to the little Christmas tree. This is way back I think in about 1946 47. Didn't know anything about a prophet. All I knew is Christmas was coming and it was the birth place and time of our savior. having being taught in a oneness Pentecostal church that was pretty important to a little boy and the only reason I learned all I did in the scriptures because the pastor's wife made sure that she gave us a gift if we learned the biatitudes the 66 books of the Bible and all these other things. So as a little tight I did everything I could to learn it because the gift was a little bronze horse. Now, I don't know, maybe mom told her, but that horse meant more to me than anything in my life. And so, and of course, when I got older, I had a horse, several horses, and I loved the horses. But while I was at the the uh room there at the house, and we were sitting there, and the gifts were given out, I noticed this big box, and mom kept saying, "You never know what's there." And I said, "Well, who's it from?" "It looks like it's from daddy." and I couldn't even hardly open the other presents. So, I started peeling it off. And what it was after I spent 15 to 20 minutes unwrapping it all and got to the last little parcel there, it was an old beat up handsaw from a barn that he thought he would just wrap up and fool me. You know, that that wasn't a gift. And I it hurt my little soul so much that I thought, why would a man do that? and my mom dropped her head. That's not the gift of a father. The gift of the father is expressing his love. &gt;&gt; My heavenly father doesn't give me anything but joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness. &gt;&gt; That's my heavenly father. &gt;&gt; So when we talk about gifts of the Holy Ghost, which I want to talk a little bit about today, the gifts of the Holy Ghost are perfect for you. You may not even realize how perfect they are, but they're there for the believer. &gt;&gt; Let me have you turn to Uh let's see here. We'll start in sorry what did you know brother Chad I was talking this in the back room there. You know brother Bram talked about the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost. Remember that it's in 1 Corinthians 12. Let's turn there a moment. 1 Corinthians 12. 1 Corinthians 12 and we'll begin reading at verse 4. Now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit. There are differences of administration but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same God which workketh all in all. But the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. For to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, by the same spirit, to another faith by the same spirit, to another the gifts of healing. by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these workketh at one, and the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. So here we are. We're claiming to be the bride of Christ. Do you believe those gifts ought to be in operation? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask it again. You believe those gifts should be in operation? &gt;&gt; It may not be evident every time you come to church or whether you're living wherever you live, but they should be in operation. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, because we are spiritual beings and because the gift of the Holy Ghost is given, we can just say, well, we didn't deserve it, but his love brought himself to us. So now the prophet told us he in us and we are in him. So it's all the same spirit now. It's not another spirit. It's God in us performing the work. So when he sends faith, it's actually him coming in and performing and operating that gift of faith in our bodies. &gt;&gt; So it's not something you have to just wish for or hope for or whatever. It's actually reality. It's God the Father coming into his son and manifesting his life there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if we could just catch some of the things that I'm going to read from the prophet this morning and realize there's nothing in the world you can do. And when I say you believe, do you know you wouldn't even have the power and ability to believe if God didn't give you that? &gt;&gt; Oh, folks, listen. When Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, why did he not stagger? Because God gave him the ability before the foundation of the world to believe his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it takes faith to believe the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because Hebrews says without faith, it's what? Impossible to please God. You know why? Cuz faith is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's not just a gift that he gives you. It's actually God himself coming to you. That's why you ought to just Oh, I said, Brother Chad, we ought to just jump out of our seats once in a while and say, "Praise God. Something's going on in my soul." You know what it is? The fire of the real Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Jim, don't talk about Pentecost. I'm sorry. Back in the 40s and 50s, I saw the real Pentecost. And it wasn't a denomination. It was a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't leave the life because it was God himself in us. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know there's manifestations that aren't of the spirit, but I'm talking the real igniter, the real fire of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We go to Acts, if you would, please. You know what I'm going to read? Yes. Acts two, I just thank the Lord for his word. &gt;&gt; And verse one, and when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord. Oh, do you realize this morning that if every one of you were in accord with one another, Brother Brandham said, "You're getting close to a rapture then." &gt;&gt; Amen. There is something in the power of the living Christ that if we could get in unity of the spirit, brother Chad couldn't even preach here. &gt;&gt; There'd be such an overwhelming presence of the of the eternal God. Don't you remember? I remember when the breath of the Holy Ghost would come over a congregation half this side and it was so strong you couldn't hardly do anything but stand up and cry and worship the Lord. Where is that this morning, folks? We don't have it anymore. Brother Jim's elderly, but so was Moses. How in the world, Brother Bram said, could anybody expect an 80-year-old man to lead the children of Israel out of bondage? It didn't matter what men thought cuz that was the intellect. But God through the soul of brother I'm going to call him brother Moses. I'm going to meet him someday. He actually came on the scene because God predestinated him. And you're the same way. You're predestinated if you got the Holy Ghost in you to be here this morning. And God will honor your commitment to himself. &gt;&gt; It's not you being a Christian. It's him being a Christian in you. &gt;&gt; You're going to fail miserably. Oh, but he comes along and and lifts you up like he does &gt;&gt; every day. &gt;&gt; I've got to slow down here. &gt;&gt; Anyway, so and suddenly there came a sound from heaven. Verse two, as a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house that they were sitting. You mean to tell me people in the upper room there felt something? Yes, sir. Was it an emotion? Probably. Was it real? Yes, sir. It was a rushing mighty wind. Why? It carried the breath of God, the very breath of God. Cuz the Bible says he breathed on them earlier and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." So, they were there in the perfect timing for God to breathe on them. &gt;&gt; There wasn't a preacher breathing on them. There was no preacher there. &gt;&gt; So, they're believers. Preachers don't mean anything. Don't look at me as a preacher. I'm not a preacher. I'm just a brother. But I'm going to tell you one thing. God has given the gifts of the church for one reason. To equip you. Not me, but equip you &gt;&gt; to understanding the word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Jim, you're excited." Oh, I haven't even started yet. &gt;&gt; I just been I I I guess I gave this example. I don't know who I preached to, so I'll give it again. When I had my quarter horse uh part thoroughbred and I got him in the gate to go rope a cow, that horse was so smart. He knew that that little barrier ring or string in front. If that was broken before before the gun went off, you you ru ruined the run. You couldn't you couldn't even score. So I'd get by the way his name was Johnny come lately. Look some of us are Johnny come lately aren't we? &gt;&gt; We came in the last hour. Do you get the same price? You got the same ones prices as I got &gt;&gt; 70 or 60 years ago. No, it's more than that. It's 70 years ago. So I'd get in the box with that horse and I knew when he jumped out he'd just about lead me back in the back of the box here. So when I nudged him and he leaped out, he wasn't Johnny come lately anymore. &gt;&gt; And I tore after because they they call it I don't know how many cowboys you got here, but when you when you talk about cow sense, that means that they have something in their nature that's bred in them to want to grab a cow because they want to round those cattle up. The cowboy runs around trying to get them into the corral. And so of course my horse had a cow in them. He'd run right up to the cow and bite him. He wanted me to throw a larette, make sure. And I'm just thinking, Lord, when you caught us, we didn't catch you. When you caught us, we might have been late, but let me tell you something. He threw the word, the last shoe of the word around every one of you and brought you into a service, not just to have an entertaining time, but to react to what the word is preached. Because faith comes by hearing. &gt;&gt; You can't even get faith without hearing. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "If you don't have faith, you won't go into rapture." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have the Holy Ghost, you won't. That's why he preached perfect faith. Got to have perfect faith because it's his faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, aren't you glad that you don't have to manufacture it? &gt;&gt; You don't have anything to do with faith. Only believe it. &gt;&gt; He set that gift there. All All he has to do is will you believe my word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will you believe me? Oh yes, Lord. Okay. Well, I'm going to let you go for about 25 years or so. Every day, Brother Bam said his faith, God's faith in him got stronger. &gt;&gt; But look, you're getting pretty old. Yeah, but you know, Sarah, how about it? Oh, not yet, Abraham. Not yet. Well, get get the needle point and all these little things ready because you're fixing to have because the Bible said by faith Sarah. &gt;&gt; Don't lay it all on Abraham. The bride's got to have the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So when it was time and the little Isaac was born, the first, you know, God, we don't understand God's dealings, but he he had one thing in mind. Destroy Isaac, the promised son. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he he actually told Abraham, "Abraham, I love you. You've followed my word. You believe what I've said. Now I'm going to have you destroy your son." Oh, that's no problem. You know why? Faith was talking. Amen. &gt;&gt; There wasn't any desire in him to say, you know, Lord, I thought it over. I just can't serve you anymore. You're going to take my my son. &gt;&gt; The son was a result of faith. &gt;&gt; So even if he would have stabbed him, he would have come back to life. &gt;&gt; So no matter Oh, I love these young people. No matter what, young people what you go through and it looks like it's hopeless because nobody understands me. The things you go through as young people, you think I'm too old. Oh, no. I know exactly what you're going through. We've all been through it. But hold steady because if faith ever strikes your little soul, you it won't matter what you have to think or go through with your siblings or people in the world, whatever. God's got his hand on you. Just reach out and say, "Lord, I need direction today." &gt;&gt; It isn't just that we &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we know we're going to all fail. There's nothing else but just to recognize it. But he doesn't let the spiritual part of the man, brother Brad said, there's two men living in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like brother Chad said about the white and the black dog, &gt;&gt; the black one doesn't want you to have faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not even getting my notes. The black one doesn't want you to have faith. It's the white one that does. &gt;&gt; And that's not a a racial statement, but there's something that the Indian said, "Which dog do you feed?" If you feed the wrong dog, you'll never arise in faith in your soul to believe God for anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't understand why you're drawn to the message and you love to hear the prophets, you don't know what's going on, but God does. And he's trying to equip you with healing and whatever deliverance you need because you are absolutely bound by God to believe his word. And faith cometh by hearing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, help us. Now, we know I've got to slow down here. You know, Lo Luther said, "The just shall live by faith." Look at that statement there. The just, you're just if you've been justified by grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The just can come and once in a while they can say, you know, God really helped me on this journey or whatever happened. Uh yeah, I guess I guess guess I am just because I've been justified. But the Bible said he was justified by faith. &gt;&gt; You're not justified by intellect. &gt;&gt; You're justified by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're justified by faith, that means you are okay. &gt;&gt; There's no problem there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're not doing it yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith is a gift of God. It's his very nature coming and living in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know I've said it, but I'm going to reiterate it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And Paul said in 1 Thessalonians, "For our gospel came not unto you in word only." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But also in power and in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that tells me you can have all the word. And I don't want you to misunderstand what I'm saying. You ought to know by now I love the word. I can't live without the word. The word word is my life. But you can have word upon word upon word by and it won't do a thing if the Holy Ghost doesn't quicken it in your soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devils believe the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they tremble. Are they going to go in a rapture? Are they saved? No, they're not. So that means just to say, "I've heard the word. I heard the word." Listen, folks, you got to get to a place where the Holy Ghost could quicken it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why brother Brandham indicated in his message, don't just copy what I'm saying. Just don't quote what I'm saying. I've got all kinds of quotes here. That isn't what you need. You need the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to take the words of the prophet and speak into your own word and say, "That's for me." &gt;&gt; I want to just give you a little story. when Paul was shipwrecked, when he was shipwrecked and they was throwing everything out because they're running a ground in Malta and he didn't have he didn't know what to do. But you see, because he was God's vessel, &gt;&gt; an angel appeared to him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; An angel is a messenger from God. We've had a seventh church age messenger angel. That's what we've had today. How many believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So the angel said, "You know what, Paul? Don't you worry. You're promised to stand before Caesar." &gt;&gt; So now that's good. But until you have the confirmation in your soul, the intellects could say, "Well, that's just a a figment of your imagination or that's just a dream you had or something." No, it was a vision. It actually happened. So here he is knowing I've got the quotes here. Knowing that he can't die in a shipwreck. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that you've got to re res respond to the word and you know whatever you're in, whatever situation you're in, brother John is he's there to deliver you. &gt;&gt; But brother Jim, that was a shipwreck. It's going down. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You got to stay with the word. Stay with the ship. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he got excited. That's what the Holy Ghost does. Gets excited. He goes up on top. Brother Bram said, and he looked and he said, and he screamed out, "Brethren, don't worry. We're going to be saved." Oh, it's easy for you to say, Paul. No, he had the revelation from the from the angel. He knew beyond a shuttered doubt. If he was here today, he'd be out of his seat saying, "That's me. That's me, Brother Jim." You know why? because the angel told him he'd be saved and he believed the word. &gt;&gt; And so what's he do? He gets up and starts screaming. Brother Bram said he screamed at the top of his lung and said, "I know what's going to happen. We're not going to perish. Not one hair in your head head is going to perish." &gt;&gt; So you you know what he did? There's a peace and there's a confidence. He goes down to the galley and makes himself a sandwich. &gt;&gt; That's a quote from brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he come up eating the sandwich. That's why I like sandwiches, especially homemade bread with good whatever inside. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to say so much here. Man shall not live by bread alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's your inside the sandwich because you got to have the bread of life. But you got to have substance inside that bread. Just like Elijah there, he had &gt;&gt; ravens send him meat and bread. morning and night, &gt;&gt; didn't he? &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bam said, "So, I like sandwiches, too." I'm not trying to make light light light of it. I'm just saying there there's so much Sure, there's humor in the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There it's a relaxing, beautiful, beautiful display of God's love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without love, you're going to perish. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you come to church. I don't care how sweet you are. You got to have love one for another. Even loving your enemies. Now, we got to go to that because what brother Chad said about the Oh, dear. I've been bottled up for too long. The what brother Chad said about the It's in the 23rd, I'll just try to do it by heart. 23rd chapter of the book of Luke. The Bible said in I believe it was Isaiah 53, there was malfactors. Those are the bad the thieves that were crucified next to him. Did that excite you when all of a sudden one of them stopped cold right there &gt;&gt; hanging on the cross? &gt;&gt; Here's my question. What was his background? How did he get into thievery? What did he do that this that would support a crucifixion? Why was he why was he crucified? Because they had a law. But the grace was hanging on a cross right next to him. &gt;&gt; There's your grace. and he's watching. One of them said, "If you were the Christ, come off the cross." But this one &gt;&gt; within an instant he was converted because he said when he heard the master say, "Father, forgive them." That was a message of grace. And every one of us have experienced the same thing. Forgive them for they know not what they do. And when he heard those words, that's the only preaching that we know he heard. Father, forgive them. And forgiveness is based, faith is based on forgiveness. And God dropped the faith down in that man right there. And he said, "Will you remember me?" And Jesus knew cuz he was predestinated. Didn't matter how many things he stole. Doesn't matter. He was hanging on the cross. If he could have, he'd have gotten off the cross and bowed his knees before the son of God. &gt;&gt; But he couldn't do it. So it's not works, brother Chad. It's not works that we do. It's just a believing by faith. And he went to paradise that day because he believed what God had said, "Father, forgive them." One little thing, forgiveness, change his whole future. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me Lord. &gt;&gt; So when the son of man cometh, when the son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth? &gt;&gt; Actually, if you go back and read the the original, he's the one that brought faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Will he find faith? I got a question for you. Look at the scriptures about the centurion. Jesus after he said, "Just send the word." Oh, what a what a deep thought. Just send the word, Lord, and my servant will be healed. &gt;&gt; And once was Jesus, I've not found. Here's your fine faith, and here's your found faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have not found so great a faith in all of Israel. That's a big statement. And it wasn't a Jew, it was a Gentile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you see why you're such a p privileged and blessed people is because God brought his word to you. &gt;&gt; When everything else failed and the Jews couldn't receive it, you received it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. The giver of faith. What a time we are. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking about what you know, I've got so many quotes here, but brother Brandham said something that struck me. He said, "Sight, si ght, and time are God's worst enemy." &gt;&gt; And I I'm thinking, "Oh my &gt;&gt; sight and &gt;&gt; time." &gt;&gt; Have you got time this morning for the word? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing, Brother Jim, or are you seeing Christ coming in in another realm and blessing you? It's not me that can bless you. All I can do is give you the word. You have to decide for yourself whether or not the spirit that you got in you is receiving the word. &gt;&gt; You don't worship Brother Chad. &gt;&gt; No. No. No man is worthy of worship. &gt;&gt; You acknowledge that there's a gift there. &gt;&gt; But that's all you do is acknowledge it. You don't lift him up. &gt;&gt; At least you shouldn't. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about it because anyway I'm I'm trying to get into my message this morning. &gt;&gt; Now, we just read about the necessities or diversities, I'm sorry, of gifts, the nine spiritual gifts. Um, first of all, faith exists in an unseen realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, now we need to go to Hebrews. you don't mind me going back and forth because I've got I haven't quot started the quotes yet, but we'll get to them. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to Good thing I can't see the clock and I I don't pay attention to this one here at all. &gt;&gt; I really just started. &gt;&gt; I haven't even started yet. &gt;&gt; Can I say I love you all? &gt;&gt; Do you understand when I said that's from the soul? &gt;&gt; God bless you. What a what a fine church with fine people. Oh my. Now, let's go to Hebrews the 11th chapter reads, "Faith, remember that's a gift. &gt;&gt; Faith is from God. Faith is the substance, the real thing. &gt;&gt; When we moved here, Brother Chad said, "I want to see reality. &gt;&gt; So do I. &gt;&gt; I don't want any pretense. I want reality." And if you don't have the reality of the Holy Ghost in you, there's an altar here. Or you can sit in your seat and get it. But you got to have reality. &gt;&gt; Oh, but be careful, Brother Jim. You know that could be emotion. Well, it's all right because I'm sure on the day of Pentecost there was emotion running. &gt;&gt; Just to hear a rushing mighty wind and cloven tongues of fire on them sure changed their lives, didn't it? &gt;&gt; Not only changed it, but it gave them the ability to come and pray and not even pray for that man at the gate, but just lay hands on him and he was healed. &gt;&gt; So, there's something in faith. Faith is a substance. It's more real. probably said this before. It's more real than the carpet on the floor or this pulpit. It's more real than that, folks. Listen to me. Faith is beyond anything in the natural because it's a it's a spiritual thing. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. You can't worship with your mind. You got to worship with your soul. &gt;&gt; God is only worshiped by the quickening power of an individual that's got the faith in them. That's how he worships. You worship him because without faith, it's impossible to please him. And you surely want to please God. He's a creator. He put you on this earth. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. There isn't anything that could ever strike a a believer. But what there is an answer for it and deliverance for it. &gt;&gt; So the scripture that says faith is a substance of things hoped for. This is an interesting scripture because all of us are expectating expecting something or ex we we when a woman is getting ready to to have a child we call her expecting. &gt;&gt; You know why we call it expecting? Something's coming down the road. &gt;&gt; Something's going to happen. &gt;&gt; When she wasn't expecting, she wasn't expecting &gt;&gt; naturally speaking. But we got to get in the place where we're expecting every single day. The prophet said in 1954, he said the Lord could come at any time. But the problem is we're not unified yet. That's right. &gt;&gt; And of course, he's dealing with the Pentecostals in the whatever. And be because I was raised in the pen UPC Pentecostal, I know there was no unity there. So, let me just finish this things hoped for. So, it's not that hope takes the place of reality. It's just that every individual is hoping that they can get closer to God. And by hoping, it isn't throwing out faith. It's in the excitement that you're hoping for something new. &gt;&gt; When you get down on your knees and you and you read your scriptures and have devotion, there ought to be an expectation. Lord, what are you going to do with my life today? Well, I just got to go to work. Don't look at it that way. We I might as well tell you we had some carpet layers come to Far and Derek's house. They had to replace the carpet because of the odor. And when he's working there, strange name, his last name Eden. Ed Dens. Eden's first name is David. It's all right if I mention his name. So he was standing in the kitchen there and I was talking to him. Don't say anything spiritual, just talking. But you see, if faith is operating in you, you're different. &gt;&gt; Not everybody could see that. So I said to David, I said, "What are you reading?" "Oh." And he took his phone. He said this. I said, "That's Bible scriptures. I'm talking about big here things, you know, tattoos all over and everything. And I'm going to declare it if he ever hears this. Brother David, I love you. &gt;&gt; God allowed that man to come in my life. &gt;&gt; Probably nobody else saw it, but I did. Now he textes me every day with scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't even know if he's a Christian. I don't know if he goes to church. What difference does that make? &gt;&gt; If God's doing the pullings through a vessel, that's all we ought to worry about. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you don't know who or when something will happen because of the presence of almighty God. The Holy Ghost is behind everything you do. &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Jim, not me. &gt;&gt; I just go to work. I just clean the house. Whatever. &gt;&gt; But you can pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can pray for your pastor, for the deacons and trustees. Pray for them. That's what God wants you to do. So, it's an expectation every time we come to church. When we walk through those doors, we ought to be so excited that when Brother Chad says something or any minister says something, we say, "That ain't nothing but the truth." Then God verifies that and vindicated in your life because you said it by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not a name caller, but I see some of my friends out there that if you if you really knew what God showed me about you, you'd say, "Oh, you're getting kind of sappy, Brother Jim." I don't I I can't help it. You're just precious, precious, precious to me. I've said it before. I've never My family's never been treated like we have here. Never. Lost my whole family, every member of my family in a cult claiming to be the message of the hour. And I come here, nobody claims anything. You know, when we say, "Well, you're all the bride of Christ." That's not even accurate because there's three kinds of believers in every church. &gt;&gt; And the pastor's trying to get through the message to the believer. And even if the unbeliever doesn't see it, you don't know. Everybody's worth something. Pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, they're all worth something. &gt;&gt; And because we don't know what their future is, we treat them all like believers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's &gt;&gt; Oh, help us Lord. &gt;&gt; So faith is the six sense. So faith is the substance of things expecting, hoped for. Now when it comes to pass, it's not hoped for anymore. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The word is the word until it accomplishes its duty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then you leave and go to another realm. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're going to be raptured because of faith, not because you come to church, not because you think everything's right and hunky dory with your family or friends or whatever. You're going to only go into rapture if there's faith in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet preached the heart on divine healing because it isn't you that gets healed by your own intellect. It's the word of God that comes to the throne on behalf of you and you hear the word. God says, "That's good. That's my boy. That's my girl. I'm going to send faith." And faith is a gift. So he gives you the gift. Not only to believe, but to understand the word. &gt;&gt; All the mysteries are cleared up. But to some, they're not. &gt;&gt; I happen to know some of the ones that go online and say this horrible things. I know them personally. &gt;&gt; They're not speaking by faith. There's unbelief there. &gt;&gt; And they'll never accomplish anything for God with that. They're going to put themselves in a horrible situation if they don't change their way. But I don't know. &gt;&gt; You don't know. We can have somebody come in our sanctuary in the in the assembly here. I don't know what their future is. &gt;&gt; So if there's somebody here today and you don't know what brother Jim is saying, I'm saying it isn't up to me. It's God. He does the pulling. &gt;&gt; I love what brother Paul Offentain wrote. I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't you. &gt;&gt; I think I'll just pull. No, it's the Holy Ghost pulling. And you're sitting there and you're receiving that pull and you say, I can't sit here anymore. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; I've got to jump out of my chair. I've got to just let God know that it's not for it's not for people to see that &gt;&gt; it's something inside of you. &gt;&gt; Listen, when they got on the day of Pentecost, they went out speaking in another language. It isn't the tongues that didn't prove anything. That was a gift that God gave them. &gt;&gt; But it was their life that was changed. &gt;&gt; They went out there and preached and got thrown in prison. It doesn't have anything to do. It never took it away from them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you see folks? Without the Holy Ghost, we're absolutely lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've got to Could you give me a a minute here? Got to read some scripture or some quotes here. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read what Brother Bram said on the restoration of gifts. Let me just back up a minute. It's not that we have to have it in manifold expressions in our church the restoration. I'm just wondering what has happened. This is my question this morning. I'm a nobody but I just wonder are we supposed to have the restoration of gifts in the church in the body? &gt;&gt; I didn't get much. But how many believe that the Bible said and the prophet said we need a revival? &gt;&gt; He said Jeffersonville needs it. &gt;&gt; Amen. they're not receiving it. And that's his own church that he preached and preached and preached to. What it is, it's because they haven't opened their heart to receive the baptism, the person of Jesus Christ to live through them. &gt;&gt; And so when the when the word of the prophet is preached, they just think, well, as long as I go to a tabernacle, as long as I do this and and and and make this my home church and whatever, that doesn't do it. &gt;&gt; We've got to have the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; God's got to come down and quicken the word. That quickened means made alive. &gt;&gt; He's going to quicken the dead and they're going to rise. &gt;&gt; Are they going to rise? &gt;&gt; How are they going to rise? They're dead. How did Lazarus rise? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Something said something to his spirit that brother B said didn't know how far off he was have gone on, but something you know what Jesus said in that in that discourse? He told his disciples a couple days away, he said, um, you'll see the glory of God manifest. I'm paraphrasing the scripture, didn't he? And so when he got there, Lesar's already dead. Did I not say to you, Martha, you'll see the glory of God. Did he say that? That's what he said. So all the groaning, hold steady here. All the groaning he did, it wasn't because he didn't believe Lazarus was going to be raised from the dead. He was groaning from unbelief. Look in your Bible and you'll see when they said, "Oh, he loved him. That's why he's crying. Oh no, he was torn apart because of unbelief." Like he cried in the garden. Lord, if Jerusalem would I'd gather him like a hen gathers a chicken. But he cried because of the unbelief of Jerusalem. It's not because he had a failure in his psychic that he he couldn't stand anymore or whatever. It was because of unbelief. Just follow the scriptural pattern all the way because he said you'll see the glory of God. Did he get discouraged and said, "Well, I guess they won't see the glory of God." No. That's why he came. That's why Lizard Lazarus was raised from the dead because the groaning in his spirit was because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Probably never heard that before, but go to the scripture and find out what happened when the Lord himself came with the disciples and said until he said, "Where have you put him?" and buried him. He shed and by the way the Greek means he shed a tear but it's from the unbelief because the pe the the Pharisees or the whoever was there said oh how he loved him based on his cry now I know the Lord cried ain't question about that but he didn't cry because he was sorrowful or sad how could he do that when he was there for one reason to bring the glory of God &gt;&gt; he had to cry because of the unbelief you can't have it both ways either he knew that he stood on the on the basis of what the father showed him because he said I'll go wake Lazarus the disciples says well it's good that he just sleeps oh no there's more there's a lot deeper than that so when he groaned in his spirit and he does the same through a prophet the prophet in our day groaned because of the sins of the people what sin unbelief &gt;&gt; those those Jews that were there they didn't believe Lazarus could be raised from the dead not even the disciples knew that God alone knew it and he told his son, you're going to you're going to give glory to me. So when he came there, he was glorifying God by the very words. And he said, "Lord, I say this to you." I'm paraphrasing because I haven't got the Bible open here, but he said, "I do the speaking for those that hear. &gt;&gt; They're around here. I don't do it because I'm questioning whether or not you can raise him. You've already Oh, brother, sisters." When all he already knew he's going to be raised, why would he bow and say, "It's so sorry. I feel so bad. That's what most of your intellectuals think of. But it wasn't that. It was unbelief. That's why any godly man weeps for the lack of revelation in his group because he wants the people to have faith to believe. &gt;&gt; Did Jesus have faith that Abra that Lazarus is going to raise? Absolutely. Did it Wayne or fall short? No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It came to pass. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because he was doing the will of his father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; I know the next thing to happen is a reg is the res restoration of the gifts to the church. And it's the hardest thing I've had to do in this pioneering work is to do this is to see the people. See, God cannot give back the gifts to a church as long as his church is divided. We've got to get the church together before the gifts can come. &gt;&gt; And then along then come along the Pentecostals. This is uh God keeps his word Pentecostals with the restoration of the gifts. And you spoke with tongues. Yes, I did. And then you made a doctrine out of that. Yes, the church did. And then what happened? Your light has gone out. What's the light? There's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; There's a switch. It's called an igniter. &gt;&gt; It goes to the panel back here. And as soon as this switch, there's a surge of power that ignites the lights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then and and down and I've been down in in in the caves down there where brother Brandon went. I know exactly how dark it is. Ca uh Carl's bed caverns. And when the man and he got a message, there's a man here that can turn on the light. It's the Holy Ghost turning it on in your life. &gt;&gt; The reason you're here is because there's been a light turned on. &gt;&gt; It isn't a man preaching. It's the Holy Ghost turning it on. You're different today because you had the light turned on in your life. &gt;&gt; He said, "You spoke with tongues, but your light has gone off." What's the matter? It's because you failed to stay with the word. God's words are always unfolding and we must unfold as God's word unfolds &gt;&gt; as as time unfolds, signs unfolds, the natural world. This man is the same man he was a thousand years ago when God made him. He's the same intellectual. He's the same intelligence. He's just the same man with the same five senses that he was thousands of years ago. But look what progress he's made in the last 50 years. I'm going to diverse just for a moment. How many were here when Mount St. Helens erupted in the 80s? Is anybody? I'm not that old. It was in the 80s. It was a devastating earthquake, wasn't it? Did you know it was devastating? And the molten rock was melted, all you geologists here. and it spewed ash out of the top of that and ripped part of that mountain off. And when the ash came down, it floated up thousands and thousands of feet, but some of it came and landed on the landscape of the mountain. Now, scientists can think, well, we'll get some backhoes up there and a lot of brothers or not scientists with rakes and shovels and we'll just scoop all that ash off of that mountain. No way. They didn't know what to do. But somebody had an idea and I believe was God's instructions to that. It might have been just a scientist, but you know what he said? I think I've got the answer for that. And it's called a gopher. So they drop some gophers down on that barren landscape. Listen to me. And the gophers have the DNA and the and the ability in them to dig. Oh, I want you to think spiritual here. And so when he put them on they put them on that landscape, there was nothing to eat. That ash had covered every green thing, killed the life, whatever. But this little gopher didn't care about that because he had an ability to dig. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he went through the ash of unbelief &gt;&gt; of of of sterile environment and he got down in the ground where we have to get spiritually sometimes. But there was a little green chute that was still buried. Even though the top was dead, there was a root down there. Just like the seed of God of the believer, there's a root. You don't have to tell the seed to produce something. Give it in the right environment in the right place and give it some moisture. The word of God, born of the spirit, it'll bring forth something. So the gophers are down there seeing these little roots of these little plants. &gt;&gt; I don't know how many gophers it was and it took 40 years but those gophers completely transformed that whole mountain side. Why? They went down and dug the life of those plants and brought it up and it started surging and surging and surging. That's what the Holy Ghost does to a believer. Sometimes it doesn't look very pretty. Sometimes you fail them all the time. But if you can get into that realm where there's true life and the life was in the plant, even though it was covered, we got to go deep in this precious word and and dig out what God has done in our day. And he sent a message and a messenger and that's what sustained it. Then when they brought it up to the the ground, all the rains and everything, they also tunnneled in so that there was moisture that could get in &gt;&gt; and it fed those roots. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it wasn't very long cuz brother Ram said even a lily has to push you say through the mud. Wasn't too long. And that little life said that's you this morning. That little life said I may be look as bad as a little gopher but there's something that I have responsible am responsible for and that is to send the word that I've heard up to where the glory can come. &gt;&gt; I just saw that this week and I said, "Lord, can I make a spiritual application with that little gopher?" You never know, do you? &gt;&gt; I don't think there was a scientist that even figured that God's creation can change that whole landscape. And I saw pictures of it. Unbelievable. Just like a an Eden Garden of Paradise because of a little gopher. &gt;&gt; And I'm a gopher this morning cuz I go for the truth. &gt;&gt; I didn't expect that. But &gt;&gt; you all are gophers, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this too simple or too? &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you do cuz I've got a lot of things that I want to talk about. &gt;&gt; Well, we read at the beginning, I come not with excellency of speech that man's wisdom teaches, but in demonstration. That's kind of a a quite a different word. demonstration really means manifestation. So when Paul said that, he said, "I didn't come with excellency of speech." And he's one that could have had it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, he was so speech conscious in whatever he said. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to diverse a minute. when he was watching Steven be stoned and he was holding the garments. Now remember Stephen and five Stephen and Philip and five other brothers were asked if you would just take care of the widows because we can't spend ourselves in prayer if if we have to do all of this. And so they laid hands and they were men full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They weren't even preachers &gt;&gt; as as as we call them preachers. You see, you can't is isolate a man and say, "Well, he's just a preacher." No, every one of you are &gt;&gt; because you're born again believers. &gt;&gt; You got to live. You may not get behind this pulp, but that this is the scariest place to be. Let me tell you, cuz I'm responsible what I'm saying this morning. &gt;&gt; And you're responsible in your little vocation or whatever you do. You're responsible. Don't think you're not. You got to live that life in front of somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So when he said when when Stephen started speaking that's just a brother to help the widow if you ever have a chance study what he said you talk about inspirational preaching &gt;&gt; you talk about and then you got Philillip was one of the seven and Philillip goes and you will listen to Philillip and of course Paul was listening to uh Stephen and then Stephen was stoned and he left and and they just Okay, let me back. How do you know? But when when you go into a restaurant or a Kohl's or some place and and there's not a glow of the Holy Ghost around you, do do you really know if there is or not? &gt;&gt; Nope, &gt;&gt; you don't. I was sitting at a table having lunch few weeks ago talking with some brothers. Half of them left and I was with one brother and all of a sudden a a black man walked up to the table. Now I I didn't think we were talking loud. Maybe we were excited. I'm I'm not sure. But he come over and stood by me and he said, "Brother, I had to come over and tell you there's Holy Ghost all around you." &gt;&gt; Brother Chad knows when I get going, I get fired up. There's just something inside of me. I've got a lot of experience, and that doesn't mean one thing. It's only what God wants to say. &gt;&gt; And I said I I kind of dropped my head like, "Oh, I was too loud." Well, he's a pastor of a church in town here, and we were invited to go. And so if I miss one Sunday or whatever, I'm going to go there. I don't know if they'll receive the message. It doesn't it doesn't matter to me. All I want to know is is he predestinated to see whatever God shows him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me? &gt;&gt; We don't know what God's got in charge or plans. &gt;&gt; He's in charge, not us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Almighty God, your commission by the son of God was to go into the world and preach the gospel. And we know that the gospel is power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. And there's a lady coming. Paul taught so many things. And I believe the father you're here tonight amongst the people. Then he goes in about this lady that came forward for divine healing and how God used the the vessel. But I want to read something that brother Brandham said. And we might get just a little bit tough here if that's all right. Are you relaxed? Because I want you to seem no matter what outward demonstration you give, as long as the inward here is the Holy Spirit, it will be it'll be the fruits of the spirit, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, patience, gentleness, and temperance. Because God I mean sorry, Satan can copy any kind of gift, any kind of manifestation, but he can't. He can't what? Copy love. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad there's a safeguard there. He can't copy love. You know why? He's not lovable. &gt;&gt; He's perverted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So any love he has is perverted. &gt;&gt; And it's not godly love. &gt;&gt; It's the prophet. You see a man humble, loving and good to his neighbors, good citizen, a good fellow and a good man and a Christian man, full of love and humility. You watch that man. He's good, charitable, longsuffering. You can talk about him and it's all right. Doesn't even matter what you say, he forgives you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've had to do that all my life. Haven't you been doing that all your life? Forgive him. Oh, he didn't really mean it. Well, he really blasted you. Oh, that's all right. Brother Brandon proved that. Doesn't matter what they said. &gt;&gt; He said, "Pray for him anyway." Well, Brother Brandham, he he's gone too far. He's blaspheing the Holy Ghost. He said, "If I didn't have love for him and pray for him, something's wrong with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're sure judges, aren't we? When we we think we got the answers. &gt;&gt; Longsuffering, you can talk about all right. He forgives you and don't make any difference. That's the real man. Keep your eye on him. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to go just touch the gifts a little bit and then I'm going to come. Oh my, look at the time. Not long ago, my little girl called me and I was here the other time and he kind of gave me a thought while he's preaching. He said, she said, "Daddy, I want you to come home." I know you've probably read this and I said, "Honey, I'm in Texas right now, but I sent you a little gift, a doll." She said, "That's just," She's four years old. "I sent you a little doll, honey." She said, "I got it, Daddy." And I said, she said, "I want you to come home, daddy." Well, honey, I sent you a little rabbit from down in Chattanooga. I got it, Daddy. But she said, "I want you to come home, daddy." See? Well, honey, daddy, she said, "I love you, and I love the gifts that you give me, but I want God. I want daddy. He was God to that little four-year-old, little Rebecca. But I want daddy. I want daddy. That's who I want. I don't just want the gifts he gives. I want the person. I want him to live inside of me. I want to know that he's there to stop things when they're happening. And you know what he said? He said, "If you feel checked on something, that isn't your intellect telling you. &gt;&gt; It's your heart telling you, be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful." Well, I just I can tell you some things that happened to my daughter almost t-boned and crash and whatever. But if you feel corrected in the spirit, which is your heart, that's the place of the soul. Brother Bram said in your heart, that little spot where there's no cells or anything. If you are are quickened by something in you, pay heed to it. Don't let it go. Realize it could be God saving you from something. But you got to be spiritual to feel that. &gt;&gt; I want to say more. You got to have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's anyone here this morning that has been seeking for the Holy Ghost, but it's kind of an embarrassing thing because you come to church. Forgive me. I I the Lord told me to say this. If it's embarrassing, I'm sorry, but I want and I know Brother Chad, this altar is full. Not that you have to come here, but if you sit in your seat and you've been praying, maybe when you raised your hand when he was praying, maybe that was your desire. Young person, old person, doesn't matter. We ought to recognize one thing. We've got to be in a place where God can speak to us. &gt;&gt; You've got a place here to respond. That's a most glorious thing. I was preaching the other day across town and there's a little gal that I told Brother Chad about it. There's a little gal that came up after the service and wanted prayer. So, I managed to get down below there and I prayed for her and I asked her, "Sis, what's what is it?" She said, she looked to be about 18, 19 years old. She said, "I have a friend in the hospital and I want you to pray for him." So, we did. I said, "Honey, do you understand what I said today?" I think so. So, I took her out in the parking lot and spent some time with her there. Told her she didn't know anything about Christianity or the prophet, whatever. And so, she's been coming back. And just the other day, they baptized her. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, you don't know when something is going to h I don't know how deep she is. I don't really care. I just know one thing. It takes a lot for a for an outsider to get baptized. When you you know, a lot of us have been in the message and when we got to the age of accountability, we wanted to. But what if you never were in the message, didn't know anything about a prophet, and all of a sudden you have a desire to be baptized? You ought to thank God right there. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost that we need. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Bear with me, folks. We got &gt;&gt; We got to get into some. Let me tell you what we need today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's quoting from Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. And I'm putting myself right here. Let me tell you what we need today. are preachers that would take the gloves off and stand in the pulpit and claim the full gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gloves are off, folks. &gt;&gt; You know what he's talking about? You put boxing gloves on, I box. You put boxing gloves on so you don't really hurt somebody. So, you're all padded here. &gt;&gt; But when it's bear knuckle fighting, which I've also done, that's a lot of injury. But he said, "I'm going to take the gloves off with a stand in the pulpit, claim the full gospel with the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost to get the people. You have to shake them a little bit this way and compromise a little that way." And just exactly the way the Lutheran's done, the way the Methodists done, that's the way the Baptists had done. And that's the way the Pentecostals are doing now. And he said, "Ph, you ain't going to like me after this. Do you really care? &gt;&gt; You're nothing and I'm nothing. &gt;&gt; What difference does it make? &gt;&gt; We need to get embarrassed. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with getting embarrassed? &gt;&gt; If we don't get embarrassed, maybe there's too much pride. &gt;&gt; I get embarrassed when somebody says, "You're wrong." I go, "Oh, okay. Tell me what's right." Brother Ben did it through his whole message. He didn't get embarrassed, &gt;&gt; right? cuz he has nothing to get embarrassed about. &gt;&gt; We're born in sin, shape, and iniquities. He's coming to the world, speaking lies. What have we got? We haven't got any proof that we're special. So, we can get embarrassed. So, if you get embarrassed, just remember brother Jim said it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see some smiling. So, I'm going to finish what I have here. He said, "Let me tell you something. It's the main thing. I'm responsible before God now. I believe that to be the solemn truth of God. Yes, sir. The only thing you have to do is get your heart right. Oh, I thought we had to go and do this and do that. No, just get your heart right. Well, that's so simple, brother. Yep, it is. &gt;&gt; But faith has to come in there. And once faith takes up a bode there, then everything that said is said in the word, you agree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not here. It's here. You're agreeing with the word and the word said you got to do this and that. Thank you Lord. I'm going to do it. So long hair, long dresses, whatever. That has nothing to do with the believer because the believer already settled in his heart that he's going to do whatever God said in his word. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take a preacher to tell you that. God's going to take care of you. You sisters that are up in age and some of you uh brothers, you know exactly. You can go through all the tests and trials you want, but when you know that you know that you know there's something that happens and you don't care what anybody says. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. We we'll try to hurry and then I haven't got into my main message about I think it was up on the board, wasn't it, brother? I think it was spiritual ignition. Can you just bear with me for a minute? I'm going to give you &gt;&gt; I'll give you a little example what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Spiritual ignition. Every one of you that came either with another friend or your husband or by yourself or whatever either put a key in what we call the ignition. Correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if I called a little young whippers snapper here that knows brother Jim and wouldn't be embarrassed because you know kids don't usually get embarrassed until they get kind of so high. And I said you know what mom and dad do when they put their key in the ignition? Oh yeah. I watch them every time we go for a ride. So it's important that that key is keyed to those little loes in the ignition. How many know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; So it's got to be keyed to that ignition. And it's a switch and you can't start the car unless now some cars have just to push a button. But it's because you have the fob in your pocket and it's allowing you to push the button. It's still a starter and it's still a key and it is a ignition. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the car would start and run down the road without you in it. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I want to base it all on this scripture right here, what brother said. So you watch that little key and if you forget it in the house and lock yourself out, what are you how are you going to get into your vehicle? &gt;&gt; It's wired for that phobe for that key. &gt;&gt; So you have to call emergency and whatever you can do or break into the house or get in the house. Your keys are in there or you've forgotten them at a supermarket or whatever, &gt;&gt; but without the key. And the song says, "Faith is a key." I'm sorry, that's not the way the song says. Um, &gt;&gt; prayer is the key to heaven, but faith unlocks the door. &gt;&gt; So, if you come up and you've been praying, that's the key. &gt;&gt; But faith is the one that opens the door so you can get in and start the car. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And you're thinking in your mind here that I know if I put the key in, naturally speaking, I can turn that thing and start the car. How many know that you have to have enough faith that your key is going to work in that car to get you to the grocery store? &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister, there is a key and it's called an ignition of the Holy Ghost. And when that strikes your little outfit, whatever it is, it could be a truck or a car, whatever, you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is allowing you to believe in that key and that starter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold steady. &gt;&gt; But the only way that that car is going to move is a spark. &gt;&gt; The key turns the ability of the spark to ignite. &gt;&gt; And it can't ignite anything until there's fuel there. And so all the mechanic I I guess you'd probably heard, but I I worked with dad as a mechanic. I rebuilt many engines. We line board him. We did whatever, poured the babbbits. We're going back into the 50s now. And every time we did it, my my dad, my stepfather would say, you know, son, you got to have absolute cleanliness because any little speck of anything in the cylinder walls will score those rings and it'll start using oil. So we had to clean up and clean up. You know, brother Dave is looking at me because he's in diesel. So, he This is a combustion. I'm talking about combustion engine. And because I've rebuilt several, I kind of know a little bit about it, but not probably as much as you good mechanics. But I do know one thing. Unless there's a battery or a magneto, that motor after it's all rebuilt and sitting there has got a lifespan of however many miles that you can use it and and how many revolutions with the crankshaft and the pistons and whatever. But those pistons were designed to explode. &gt;&gt; And when the explosion occurs, brother Brandham, I can read the quotes here, called it a combustion. He said, "I don't understand combustion." But you see, combustion is a effect when you have the fuel and the spark and the atmosphere. Now, when the gasoline for you, I might lose some people here, but the gasoline has to be vaporized. You could have gasoline in a big b bottle or can up here and I could throw a match right in it and put the match out. It wouldn't do anything. But you atomize that gasoline. &gt;&gt; I want you to you atomize it. That's in the spirit realm. &gt;&gt; When you atomize a gasoline, it's getting ready for ignition. &gt;&gt; And when the ignition strikes it, it has one purpose. It wants to explode. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in you. When you hear the word, you know the fuel is the word, but the word alone is dead. &gt;&gt; The letter kleth, &gt;&gt; but the spirit gives it life. I don't care how good I rebuilt an engine. If I didn't have it ready to experience the fire of the fuel and the gas that was in there and it atomized into another a vapor, it would never start. But even if I did all that and it started, it it isn't going to go anywhere. So I can go in and sit down in the flesh seats and go to sleep. What do we do engines for? &gt;&gt; What do we come to the message for? To move on. &gt;&gt; There has to be a move. So that's called transmission. Did you know the scripture? Oh dear, I get going on the transfiguration. When Jesus was up on the top, did you know that means transformed? &gt;&gt; Same word, &gt;&gt; transfigured. So, you're transformed by the renewing. But it isn't this mind. It's the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here I'm sitting in a an old model A that I rebuilt and I'm I'm saying, "Dad, I I think I did right." Well, son, we'll find out. And so I got in there and turned the key on and pushed the starters on the floor and pushing and roar roar roar roar. And I said, "Dad, what's wrong?" He said, "It's not getting any fire. It's not getting any ignition." Well, Dad, I've got the key in. I He said, "No, come out here and look." And some of the plug wires. Now, remember the plugs, Brother Brand, I've got the quote. He said, "That's where the spark comes from." &gt;&gt; And how did they receive the spark? From the coil or the magneto. And it sends that message down to those sparks. And the sparks are the Holy Ghost. But it takes a power of the Holy Ghost to to start them going so that they send down through the spark plug to the combustion chamber so that little vaporized gas can be ignited. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost does in his service. So when our brother starts to preach something and you graise God, that ain't nothing but the truth. There's an explosion going on. It's called combustion in the realm of the spirit. &gt;&gt; You can't live in a church or in a in a age without having that happen in your life if you're a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you die and you you you're put in the grave, you're already alive in Jesus Christ while you're here because the rapture is a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not some figment and something that's going to happen way down. It's right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that rapture is a revelation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe faith is a revelation? Do you believe that God can come on the scene in any aspect of your life and quicken the word to you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me read a couple more quotes here and then we'll try to try to wind down. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; My my my how precious his word is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you'll bear with me. I'm going to just define something I just said. Remember I said I've got it written here. Here's what the prophet said. Not to have this is 1963 sir we would see Jesus not to have him explain today with great intellectual messages explain the Lord we can explain it till you we can explain it till you can see the real picture that isn't what we're looking for tonight we're not looking to the mechanics we're looking for the dynamics and I know you've probably heard this preached by by brother Chad or many other ministers but I want to zero in on something. You got the mechanics. I know what the mechanics are because I built the motor. I know the talent tolerances are right. I miked all the journals. I know exactly what it is. But that doesn't mean I don't make a mistake, but that's just the mechanics. And it would sit on the garage floor for centuries if if I didn't pick it up and apply &gt;&gt; something to it. &gt;&gt; It had to go in a vehicle. &gt;&gt; You're the vehicle. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; The mechanics, that's you. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; So God wants to take your life and put it in a vehicle for his pleasure that he can send you out. That's why I'm getting back to you'll be my witnesses. &gt;&gt; He's going to demonstrate his love and life through you. &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Jim, I'm nothing. I'm just a sister that stays at home and Oh, bless your heart. That's exactly what we need. It's more sisters going home. I know cuz I feed on some of their their meal trained meals. And I want to say to the sisters, boy, you can you sure can cook. So, let me finish with the what he said. We've got mechanics of the religions of the bride so bottleized. What a word. It looks like a great big 16 to 35 coach train sitting out there on the track. But you haven't got any steam in it. It takes the dynamics to perform with the mechanics. So, you got this huge freight train out there loaded with coal and everything else and it hasn't moved an inch. &gt;&gt; It can't move unless the inspiration hits it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, inspiration is the opposite to expiration. You look at your food and you see it's expired. Oh, we can't use that. Well, they kind of give you a little bit of leeway there, but when you die, you're expired. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'll go here. You have to die to yourself &gt;&gt; to be inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said you have to die to yourself. So anything you're going through, consider it nothing. &gt;&gt; You give your life to the gospel. &gt;&gt; It isn't just Paul that gives his life. You have to give your life. &gt;&gt; Every believer gives their life because they have to die to themselves. And by dying to yourself, you're expiring your duty or your ideas or whatever else you have. and you're going to live a new and it's going to be used by God so you can be a vehicle of his expression. &gt;&gt; Do you believe his word? &gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to try to close. I'll call the musicians up in just a moment. And I've got a song I want to sing that inspired me so much in my little study. I just said, "Would you dare sing that for the people?" You know, I haven't sung for a long time because I'd rather preach than sing anyway. But I I sometimes get a burden to sing. And now you're going to help me today. But listen to what he said. You haven't got any steam because it takes the dynamics to perform with the mechanics. And what we need now is to see that this is what we've been taught all these years. Is it the truth or not? It's been explained over and over and over through different seminaries and churches and forth until we are looking to see who this person is that'll make this real. Brother Brandham, how would you do it? We said last night, we have so much of the mechanics and not the dynamics. Now, my body is a mechanics, but my body will not operate without the dynamics. The spirit of God and the spirit operates my body and it brings it into control. Oh, I love this. brings it into control. Like an automobile with no gasoline in it, with no firing power power, no matter how fine the dynamics are, the mechanics is fixed up, the cylinders, the points, the plugs, whatever more, it's got to have the current. So, the current that's running through this building, I looked in the back there and saw the panel and all the conduit that's running in from all the lights. And you don't look at that, but there's a little energy running along the wire that's expressed in the light. &gt;&gt; And without that coming through the wires and expressing the light, you'd be in darkness. It's got to be the same thing in your soul. &gt;&gt; There's got to be an expression of the power of God in your soul. And you will be the light of the world. But without that expression that God put in your heart, you will never be the light of the world. You can't even know what God wants you to do because you have to have the Holy Ghost. Here's what he said. My body is the my body is mechanics and the dynamics is the spirit and the spirit operates by body and that brings it into control like an automobile with no gasoline, no firing, no fine dynamics. The mechanics is fixed up in the cylinders which I just read. It's got to have the current also. You got to take all of it together. &gt;&gt; That's the way God is. It's got to get a believer with God to make the contact. Then something is fixing to happen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Exactly right. I'll find my last quote here and then I'm going to have the musicians come. Just hold steady though. I know there were several that raised their hands when brother Chad was taking the prayer request and uh I have no idea and Brother Chad doesn't probably but there's needs in our assembly. How many know that &gt;&gt; it's pretty quiet. &gt;&gt; I said there's needs in our assembly. &gt;&gt; How many today have a need? &gt;&gt; Oh, bless your heart. If I could, the prophet said, if I could go down and heal every one of you, I would. So, I'm going to tell you how it comes. Okay? &gt;&gt; You watch a patient that's healed, lest it is an outstanding miracle, watch divine healing and a miracle is two different things. Divine healing is one thing and miracle is another thing. But an ordinary run of divine healing when the unclean spirits cast out and a cancer devil when it leaves a person now or say we take something so you can see it more visible. I'll say the cataract. What happened when that man if you'll notice the blind person I don't know whether I've ever had any here or not yet con cataract eyes and I'll let them stand for a few moments. Why? so that the ca shrinkage begins to take place on the platform he's talking about tell him them to come back and give a testimony oh my they can see wonderful oh my just I can see things what's the matter it's the life is gone brother said the body of the cataract is shrinking but he said after a while they begin to get it that's why I want to establish something I have no issue with The doctors I think they're absolutely God's gift to people. But there is a great physician. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That with the Holy Ghost, you have the right to get your healing &gt;&gt; with the right mental attitude towards the any divine promise of God. &gt;&gt; It'll manifest itself. So here's what he said. You begin to get a headache after you prayed for it. Get up the next morning. I'm losing my sight again. Even though the cataract was was gone, you're losing your sight again. Listen to me. Some of them said, "Uhoh, he was just worked up. That bunch of holy rollers got you worked up." Don't you believe that. &gt;&gt; That's a lie of the devil. If you believe that, you'll go right back blind again. &gt;&gt; What's he saying? It takes time sometimes. Unless it's an instantaneous miracle, it takes time. Don't lose your patience. &gt;&gt; If you really from your heart and soul said, "Lord, I believe you've healed me. &gt;&gt; In your name, I accept my healing." Stay with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People, I'm asking you to stay with it. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Well, you know, I never really really understood it." And what? Stop just a moment. Listen to what he said. Then what happens? and you say, "Well, I'll just hold on and say, "I'm sorry, Lord. I believe." But you've already expressed doubt right there. Then what happens? The body swells for so long, it covers over that sight again. That cancer in the body that was just ruled out and covered by the prayer of the saints will swell. You'll become hurting and aching again. Then you'll get horribly sick. Oh, wait a minute, brother Jim. Horribly sick. Boy, he prayed for me in the cataract shunk. Yep. But let's look at what divine healing really is. He said, "You'll get terribly sick." Sick. Why? That big growth of dead flesh in you is laying there dead. You go back to the doctor and he will say, "Oh, that's nonsense. That cannot be right. I can still see it. It's there. But brother Ram said, "But it's dead." &gt;&gt; Then he says one beautiful thing, "Hallelujah, it's dead." &gt;&gt; This is for somebody this morning. Now, the bloodstream has to purify the body. Every time the heart throws the blood around the body, it picks up that infection that was there. Sure, you're sick. If you had a chunk of meat hanging out in the shed somewhere or long or whatever and something big around as your finger hanging there and it was dead that much dead meat hanging in you. Well, it's rotting inside of you. Well, of course your bloodstream has to keep that pure as it pumps through. But there there's a dead body inside of you because of faith. &gt;&gt; Because of faith, there's a dead body in you. &gt;&gt; Well, we don't want a dead body in us. But you want faith, don't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith will take care of it. &gt;&gt; Oh dear. Just hold steady. &gt;&gt; Oh dear. No matter how sick I get, that doesn't have nothing to do with it. The first thing you know, you'll get cleared up. Everything will be all right. It's dead. The operation that the doctor would have taken from you, that same growth is laying in you with no life in it, and it'll eventually leave. &gt;&gt; That's divine healing. &gt;&gt; That's not miracles. Now &gt;&gt; instantaneous is miracles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been around seven years teaching across America having these healing service. I just got a good notion to start back across the country teaching the Bible on de demonology. How the people can understand what to do. And that's the reason they go to these meetings. If you don't understand the people come out many times they get prayed for and then they come back in a week or so and say, "Well, I've still got it." Brother Bram said, "Of course you do because you doubted it." Yeah, &gt;&gt; folks. I know what this is. &gt;&gt; You're looking at someone that's experienced divine healing. &gt;&gt; And every symptom would say the people say, "Oh, he's not healed." I know that I was healed and am healed by the grace of God and the faith in his word. That's the healing. &gt;&gt; For by grace are you saved through faith, that not in yourself is the gift of God. He dropped the faith of the faith of God in me. And that is what heals everybody. It's the faith. I don't care how old you are. I don't care if you've gone through operations like I have. You still have an opportunity to stand for the word and say, "Get behind me, Satan." Brother Bram said, "He's just a bluff." But, Brother Jim, I'm older and you know, I have to go through things. I don't care what age you are. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a little baby with a brain tumor. I don't care. God is still the healer. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord as we stand this morning that health thee. musicians if you would come. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. So Abraham didn't get weaker. He would have if his faith had failed, but he got stronger. &gt;&gt; And if you've got something that you're trusting the Lord for, don't lose patience. That's what brother Brandham said. Time. &gt;&gt; That's the worst thing. That's the worst battle brother Brandham had was time. Sight and time. Well, you don't look healed. You don't act healed. Yeah. Don't Don't go by sight and go by time. Whatever God's give you patience, if it takes three years, you still believe it. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter because it has nothing to do with the physical. It's a spiritual &gt;&gt; inside. Oh, help help us Lord to see. Help us Lord to see. I'm leaving a lot out as you know, but I got a song. &gt;&gt; And I you know what I I said as I was studying early late last night and early this morning, I said, you know, Lord, there's a song that was written in 1861 by a a sister how and it's called Well, I'm going to read it if that's all right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. the battle hymn of the republic. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know the words, but we're fixing to get them. &gt;&gt; And I want you to get excited because well, I don't want you to get You should be excited. &gt;&gt; Listen, as we get a key, I don't know. They think it's B flat or C or G or whatever. I know you all know that song. They're very hesitant, aren't they? [Music] Can you get me? Is that B flat? Okay, that's as good as any. I'm waiting on you folks. You're going to sing it from your soul. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. Have you? He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored. He has loosed the faithful lightning of his terable swift sword. That's my king. His tr is maring on. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Sing it. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. His truth is mighty. [Applause] I have seen in the heart of 100 serving cats. Yeah. Heaven offer in thee and I can reach righteous sentence by the different land is my singing. Oh glory, glory, hallelujah, glory, glory, hallelujah, [Music] glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth is still maring. He has sound forth the trouble in our day that'll never sound retreat. He has sent me the hearts of men before his judge to answer my feet of God. Sing it everyone. Glory, glory to glory, glory. Hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. His truth is the last verse in the beauty. Christ was born across the sea for the glory in his boss and death transfigured you and me as he died to make men holy. Let us die to self to self our God. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] Glory, glory, hallelujah. is true mighty. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. God be praised. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking as brother Jim was preaching, I couldn't help myself of brother Brandham when he went to Mishawaka and he saw something he didn't think he could see. saw a 90-year-old man that he thought was too old to preach, but when the spirit of God hit him, he jumped up, clicked his heels, and said, "Whoopee, there's not enough room up here for me to preach." &gt;&gt; You know what that was? That that's not an earthly enthusiasm. That's the spark. Amen. &gt;&gt; That hit. Amen. I was thinking of Brother Jim, you know, he he's 84 years old. He's my flip opposite. I'm 48. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Mim talked about brother and sister kids still going out and trying to reach people. They were in their 80s and started preaching before he he was a baby, before he was born, I think. And brother Jim's been preaching this message before I was born. Brother Beam said, "Sometimes they get tired." And I watched them and I think I'm not tired anymore. And this morning I thought, I'm not tired anymore. What I need is I need that fresh spark of the Holy Ghost to give me that same enthusiasm. How many of you saw, Amen, a brother 84 years old with enthusiasm for not for sports and not for uh a business, not for making some progress in the world, but for the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it makes me want a fresh spark. Amen. Brother Beam said, "There's one filling, but many refillings, and today I desire a refilling." Amen. How many of you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost? How many you want a spark every day of your life? &gt;&gt; I mean, feel yourself, Amen. sitting there as an engine with no crank anymore sometimes just parked not going anywhere but you want to get down the road it's going to take a spark of the power of God igniting the word that we love &gt;&gt; igniting the word that we love moving us who are already children of God filled with the word that we love. Amen. Filled with the Holy Ghost but we need it to spark again and again and again. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many are holding on &gt;&gt; with faith believing in the promise? &gt;&gt; What an encouragement to my soul. &gt;&gt; Man, God is so good to us. Friends, if you could just bow your heads with me, I just want just wanted you to have an opportunity. If you're here and you don't feel like you've ever received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you don't feel like that spark has ignited that you love the word, you love God, you want to be a child of God, you believe in your heart that you are, you've accepted all that God has done for you and all that he's done in this hour, but you just feel like you're a parked car and you want to be moving by the power of God's spirit. Not by intellect, not by your own effort, but you just want to move. I invite you now just to raise your hand to God to signify to God, God, I want to spark. I don't want to be a parked car. I believe I'm part of the program. I believe you're calling me. I believe it all. But I need a power that's beyond my power to move me in your program. You just lift your hands so God would know. Amen. God, you see the hands, Lord, just move down. I pray, God, that the power of your Holy Ghost would spark an ignition right now in every heart and every life. Lord, if we're holding on to your word for a manifestation of healing or deliverance, I pray you would spark it now, that you would quicken it to life, that we would know that I've got the promise, no matter how long it takes. Oh God, I pray you'd move down in hearts and lives, move into your souls of your children, Lord, and bring what's laying there to life. Lord, they're responding because of a seed. They're responding because of your word. They're responding because there's something laying there. There's a predestination that's calling out for more. And I pray God you would come and provide the more. Lord, that you would provide the power, amen, of the power to bring a changed life, the power to move your children into motion, the power to bring your word to pass in our lives. Pray you'd do it now, Lord, for your preaching is not in vain. There's a reason you moved our brother this way. There's a reason you moved him this way. Amen. It's your calling to us, Lord. You're calling to us to have that spark of life. You wouldn't have preached it if you're not willing to give it. Lord, you wouldn't have called for it. You wouldn't have opened our eyes. You wouldn't have given us a desire if you're not willing right now to meet that desire. Oh God, I pray you touch the lives of your children. May you send the power of the Holy Ghost to quicken them like you did on the day of Pentecost, like you've done all through the ages, Lord, when you quickened your children to life. May you do it now, God. I'm asking in Jesus Christ's name. Let nobody leave here feeling like a unmovable parked car with no power. But Lord, may they leave here knowing that God, you've sparked something in their life. And God, you've called them to move down the road and carry your program forward. Lord, let it be so. Let it be now. Let it be real. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Lord, move over your children. sweep through this place. God, you sent a wind, Lord, on the day of Pentecost, and you sent a fire broke into the licks of fire. And God, we may not be, Lord, in that place where we would actually feel a physical wind or we would see licks of fire, but may the reality of that wind sweep through the souls of your people. May they feel it move them on the inside, Lord. And may they know that there's a fire that's burning on the inside, the lick of fire that's burning the old life out and bringing life through that seed. Lord, may they feel the wind sweeping through this place as it sweeps through the hearts of your children. Breathe on us, God. Give us, Lord, that life that we so want. And Lord Jesus, there's so many of us, Lord, that we've had that experience of quickening, the quickening power to quicken us to life. But oh God, sometimes Lord, we we we we put it back in park again. We got tired and we got wore out. We got beat down and we've lost a bit of enthusiasm, Lord. God, I pray that you would come by the power of your spirit and reignite us once again, Lord. God, as your prophet told us that we could have many feelings, Lord, I'm lifting my hands for another outpouring of your spirit in my life. Amen. That you would give me the enthusiasm of this gospel, the excitement for the word. Amen. the zeal and the passion to keep moving forward. I pray God you'd fill me aresh that you'd pour yourself in me again. May I feel your wind sweep through me and through many others once again. And may you, God, give us that excitement and enthusiasm we long to have. God, we love you. We're so excited to serve your program. We're so excited to be alive in this end time. We're so thrilled, Lord, that you've privileged us with ears to hear and eyes to see and a heart to perceive. God, may you continue to sweep through us and move us in your program. We give ourselves holy to you, Lord. We love you with all of our heart. We rejoice in this word. We rejoice in your life. We rejoice in the power that you've sent, God. May you accomplish your goal in us. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. As we sing, Amen. I welcome you. If God has moved in your heart and stirred in you and you still feel stirred, you want to pray, don't rush. Don't don't hurry out. If God's still working in you, amen, you're welcome to stay, worship, pray, come to the altar, bow at your seats, bow your head where you're at. It doesn't matter to me what you do. But if you feel God stirring and drawing and calling, don't walk out the door until you fully surrender to that call. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just give him a chance. Amen. To do his work.
