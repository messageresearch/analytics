TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Paul was a prisoner Bound by chains of love to Jesus Christ not by a law not by rules not by a religious code but by his love for the person of Jesus Christ he was bound until all he wanted to do was please him and we bind ourselves in a loving relationship with a husband and wife until we're committed we can have faith in one another even if we're separated over great distances amen I I traveled the world I can be on the opposite side of the planet and I have no question whatsoever about the faithfulness of my wife and she has no question whatsoever about my faithfulness and it's not because of law it's not because of a rule book amen it's because we love one another because we as two persons have come together in a relationship and that relational bond is so strong that no matter what I wouldn't do anything to hurt her and she wouldn't do anything to hurt me now if a human relationship can do that amen why not a relationship with God that's why I do not understand people living in sin I understand making mistakes I completely understand making mistakes amen we make mistakes all the time I disappoint my wife all the time she disappoints me we have to make that right but how can we say we love God and continually live in a situation we know is contrary to his will and to Israel how can we say that oh I love God so much but I'm trampling all over his word which he is the word the word is also the person but my love for him should cause me to want to please him because I know God can be pleased sometimes I I feel like religion is still Among Us I feel like religion is still creeping in to where I can trample the Commandment of God and come and sing a song Amen and I'm looking at the church and I'm looking at my brother but I'm not realizing I have just stomped on the heart of God amen but a personal relationship won't allow me to do that if I fail him I can't wait to make it right and tell him I'm sorry because to me he's more than a book to me he's more than a theology to me he's more than the building he's more than the Fellowship of the Saints to me he's a person and that person is a personal God to me amen we've we've grown past legalism I pray we've grown past Church order keeping the conduct I want to grow past all of that I want to grow back into the place where I love him the person of the word is who I love I love him because he first loved me I love him because he gave himself for me and showed and demonstrated his love for me by redeeming me and then calling me to himself and then unveiling himself to me and that love relationship is what is binding me I want to be bound with the same change that Paul was bound by
