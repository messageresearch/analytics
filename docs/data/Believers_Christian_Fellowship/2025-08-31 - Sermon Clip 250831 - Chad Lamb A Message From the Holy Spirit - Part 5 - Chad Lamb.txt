Oh, how I wish I had time to go back into Ezekiel. What? Now, where does he want to go? He does all this and now he wants to go to Ezekiel and pull out them dry bones and show you. He said, "Can these bones live again?" He said, "Prophesy." Said, "How can prophecy come?" Only through the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord. Hear ye dry bones, the word of the Lord. And send you skin came upon them and they stood up a mighty army and began to march towards Zion. Glory to God. Listen. Glory to God. Oh, praise God. That's him. That's him. The victory. &gt;&gt; What's him? Can these dry bones live? What dry bones? It's the army of the Lord. It's the church that went down through four stages of the insect that ate it down to nothing but began to come back through three stages. Senu listen he brother Bam breaks this all down in the message. He comes back in these dry rooms. Senue came bone came to bone. sin you came skin come upon it and it's standing back a mighty army and it says then it calls for the wind to come which is what is the wind is the original life the breath of God the Holy Ghost Amen and the latter rain and the and the third pull amen the Holy Ghost came back into this body his body his bride body to bring him back to life and then what does he say then she's marching on to Zion oh praise God what is Zion it's the bride what happened somewhere along the line. This but this this army never made it all the way to Zion to the marriage of the lamb. But praise God, there's going to be a restoration. Not a new army, but a restoration of the original army, which was the church that came out of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to bring it back. He says, "Prophesy." How are you going to prophesy? Only through a prophet. It's only a prophet that can bring this body of the bride back to life. the army of the Lord. And what's this army going to do when it comes to life? Finish the journey. The first age didn't finish. She's going all the way to Zion. She's going to enter into Bula land. She's going to be married to the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about, friends. &gt;&gt; That's what this ministry is about. That's what the vindication is about. That's why you're here. And that's why your soul is jumping and a shouting and a stirring because this is you. This isn't a doctrine. This is you. This isn't a teaching. This is you. This is the purpose you were born for. This is the attribute that's inside of you that was back in God's mind when he was alone with his attributes, thinking of himself becoming flesh. That's what's inside of you. Can't contain itself anymore because it's him coming to the manifestation of this prophecy. And he's coming in his glory. He's taking what was defiled, what was broken, what was cast down, and what was utterly useless. And by his blood and by his spirit and by his work, he's restoring the masterpiece again. And it glorifies him, &gt;&gt; not her, &gt;&gt; him. &gt;&gt; Because the woman is the glory of the manise. &gt;&gt; That's why we've got to be under hers. That's why we don't take denomination. That's why we don't seek sign. That's why the only thing for us is the original word. &gt;&gt; To be pregnant by the word, to manifest the word, to become the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the whole
