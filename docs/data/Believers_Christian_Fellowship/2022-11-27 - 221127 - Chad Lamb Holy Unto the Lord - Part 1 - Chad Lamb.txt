name amen and while we're standing let's just read a scripture out of First Peter chapter one also uh it gives me a great pleasure to say that we'll be having a baptism today at the end of service our brother Alan and sister Tammy Reisner desire to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we have a double baptism a husband and wife together and I think that's a tremendous thing so I'm looking forward to that consider it a tremendous blessing just to be able to be part of that also I want to uh just thank everybody who helped with the meetings this last weekend it was wonderful I so appreciated the word I appreciated the fellowship I was really really blessed by it so I thank God for everybody who contributed and did their part brother Alistair is home safe he let me know he got back home so appreciate your prayers brother Daniel white and his family will be a true word Tabernacle this morning brother Daniel's taking the morning service then they'll be heading to Detroit tonight and they're flying out early in the morning so remember them in prayer as they travel home but they all had a wonderful time they all commented on how kind you all were and how loving and how they felt at home and that did my heart a lot of good as well so God bless you all and thank you for that man I was I was greatly edified and fed by the word this past weekend and it was a great encouragement to all of us I believe but now let's let's look into the word here first Peter chapter 1 verse 13. first Peter 1 and 13. submit yourselves to every ordinary ordinance of man for the Lord's sake whether it be no I'm in the wrong spot I'm in second I'm sorry First Peter chapter 1 verse 13. wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be you holy for I am Holy God bless you as you take your seeds amen so I was reading out of chapter 2 verse 13 I said chapter one over and over and it's never as as fun for me as interesting as for when brother Branham gets the wrong scripture because it's the word opening in a major way me it's just a man who can't find the right chapter but anyways God is good to us and I wanted to look at this scripture here as a as a springboard to launch into the subject of holy unto the Lord I want to take for a subject holy unto the Lord and I want to look at some scriptures and talk about this and one of the main reasons is God dropped us in my heart this just title holy unto the Lord and and meditating on it I realize that so often we have a wrong understanding of what it means to be holy we have a wrong understanding of Holiness I find so many times Within Myself and I don't know about you but I can speak for myself that sometimes I come up with a Nazarene idea of Holiness or I come with a you know a previous Church age idea of Holiness and I haven't really caught the concept that God's bringing of what it means to be holy it's not necessarily what I've always thought it to be I'd like to go back and look at this in the Old Testament if you can go with me to Leviticus and we're going to go to quite a number of scriptures today but if you could keep your Bibles handy we'll go to Leviticus and begin looking at this subject so Peter commends us to be holy to be holy in all manner of conversation conversation is the way you live it's not just talking to another person but in the Bible this word conversation means your lifestyle or the way you live and we're to be holy in all men of conversation because it is written be holy for I am Holy because God is Holy he's called us to be holy and so when we look at this in comparison we begin to think because God is Holy I must be holy then then somehow my my idea of being holy or Holiness is some level of perfection where there's never a fault in me anymore that I'd never make a mistake that I've come to sinless Perfection and when I get to this point where I'm never I have no more fault then I'll be holy but that is not the Bible definition of what it means to be holy and so I want to look into the scripture when God says be holy or call something holy what is God talking about because I don't want to get an old Methodist idea or a Nazarene idea or a Pentecostal idea of Holiness and when we talk about Holiness sometimes our mind goes Amen to long hair and long dresses and that old Holiness Pentecostal that came in from the nazarenes amen and that's not necessarily the definition of holiness amen you you could you could uh you could be dressed perfectly modest and in every way your attire can be pleasing to what God desires for a woman or a man to dress and you can still not be holy so it's not just when we say Holiness we got I want to break myself away from the pilgrim Holiness Church I Want to Break myself away from the nazarenes and from the Methodist and from the Pentecostal Holiness and I want to know when God calls something holy what does he mean by that when he tells us to be holy what does he mean by that because if not we find ourselves going back into a Works program where we must be holy by doing a lot of good things to be holy and we can do a lot of good things and not be anyways in any way holy at all we can act right talked right dressed right and not even be close to being holy so what does it mean to be holy let's look at Leviticus chapter 20 verse 5. it says then I will set my face against that man and against his family and I will cut him off all that goal of whoring after him to commit whoredom with Molech from among their people and the soul that turneth after such is have familiar spirits and after Wizards do go a whoring after them I will even set my face against that soul and will cut him off from among his people sanctify yourselves therefore and be holy for I am the Lord your God and ye shall keep my statutes and do them I am the Lord which sanctify you so there's a couple words here that I want to look at the word sanctify yourselves and I am the Lord that sanctify you and be holy and I want to look at what what this means and what the Lord's referring to so if we look at the word sanctify the word sanctifying the word holy in this in these uh last two verses verse 7 and verse 8 are very similar words they're very close to one another with similar meanings so the word uh the word sanctify means to consecrate to sanctify prepare to dedicate to be hallowed to be holy to be Sanctified or be separate the word holy means something that's sacred or holy or a saint or something that's set apart and so we'll find brother Frank if you could bring up the Whiteboard I think I'm going to use that a little bit this morning we find I I want to um I want us to have I I myself want to have an understanding of this so I don't if I slip back into that legalistic mode of being holy then I'm going to find myself really frustrated and when I have when I have to be holy by keeping a code then I'm going to find myself always short of Holiness and and it becomes an unattainable goal uh I've used the analogy before the it's the carrot on the stick but somebody in my family told me that half the people probably don't have a clue what I'm talking about especially young people and I'm realizing that I still consider myself really young but I did have a rotary dial phone when I was a kid and I lost half the crowd when we talk about the the carrot on the stick amen it's the old thing if you have a donkey and you're sitting on your donkey and you can't get the donkey to move forward and you whip him in the back he's not going amen some clever kid found out one day if I just take a stick and I tie a carrot on it and I hold it out in front of the donkey the donkey walks towards the carrot get him to move amen that's great to get a donkey to move amen but but eventually the donkey's going to realize I have never eaten that carrots this is an unattainable goal and sometimes we we the ideas that we have are unattainable goals the concepts that come down by tradition through church ages and and these were these were people's best idea best concept on on teaching the word but we've got the open book in this day that opened up the very nature of God to us Amen to understand God in a way that we're not constantly plodding along after an unattainable goal amen and we're not we're not moving and being motivated by trying to gain to this thing that we're never going to gain on our own with our own efforts it's an absolute impossibility all we do is is move move but we never get there amen and I don't want I don't want to become tired in my service to God I want to be joyful and vibrant and exuberant in my service to the Lord I don't want that old tired feeling of I'm never going to get there I'm never going to arrive I'm never going to make it I'm never going to be good enough I'm never never never and and it's it's this constant motivation to do better and we do good for a couple days and then we found we go right back to the starting point and got to start all over again that is not how God leads his people that is not God how God has instructed his people amen so I I want to I want to understand these things in a different light so I'm going to write on this board here and I want to look at a couple terms first term is Holy now in the Bible we look at English words in English words trying to become a definition for what was written originally in Hebrew or in Greek or Aramaic or however it was amen so sometimes words are used interchangeably sometimes we'll see the same English word like sanctify it can be used three or four times but underneath that word is two or three different Greek words that sanctify as trying to fulfill love is one for instance love can mean a a a familiar feeling love for a friend or agape love which is perfect love the love of God Amen and it's the same English word but there's actually two concepts laying underneath of that the same thing with the terms holy and sanctify and consecrate amen sometimes you can use the same English word but it's being used in place of two different Hebrew words two different Greek words amen just trying to understand but when you go and look back at what God's saying and what the prophet has taught us we begin to understand what it is God wants from his people what is it that God is looking for what is it he's instructing Us in so when we look at the word holy we can we can say that which is sacred or set apart now I'm trying just to keep things simple I mean we could go into a word study and go for hours and talk about the nuances and I would be the only one having fun this morning I'm trying not to make a simple subject complicated I just want to keep a simple subject simple because what I'm trying my best to do I find sometimes that I can make things that should be simple complicated and I'm not trying to do that so to sanctify to sanctify or be Sanctified or sanctifying all of these versions of sanctify if we could just look at it this way it means to separate separate to be separate or to consecrate when some of these terms are used we can talk about something that's holy when we talk about something that's holy in the Bible we're talking about something that is sacred it's sacred in itself it is a sacred thing it is something that is set apart it's designated differently it's it's it's sacred it's set apart when we talk about sanctify it can be the to separate the act of separating the thing that will be holy or or it can be to be separate it could be both it could mean either that which is being separated or that which is already separate and that's what can be confusing about this so is Holiness the act of being separate or is Holiness being separate amen and I would say it's both amen it's the act of being separate and it's it's also already separate we'll get into this you'll understand it better or it means to consecrate there's a we consecrate and dedicate this we have consecrated this Sanctuary to the worship of God we don't do other things in here this is consecrated to the worship of God this place is set apart set aside it is Holy the chairs aren't holy the carpet isn't holy the the desk isn't holy the air conditioning holy the drywall's not holy the paint's not holy in itself it is not sacred and that it has sacred properties in itself but when you say holy ghost the Holy Ghost is sacred in itself right so when I say the Holy Ghost when I say the holy God when I say the Holy One it's holy in itself it is Holy it is sacred if its own property it's sacred but when I say this is now a holy Sanctuary this is set apart and consecrated and dedicated for the worship of God it's Holy by designation because it's been set apart for a holy purpose all right we're starting to understand and the act of consecrating this place putting doors up putting seats in keeping everybody out setting guidelines we don't do this in here we don't do that amen that is the act of sanctifying or hollowing this place so when we don't run when we don't talk when the deacons watch the doors when we make sure that there's no there's nothing going on in here that's inappropriate we are sanctifying this place keeping it holy does that make sense all right because all of these terms we can throw out a lot of terms and then get confused Sanctified to be Sanctified holy Holiness but really that there's there's there's a holy thing that is set apart amen and considered sacred and holy there's also holy things that are Sacred by their own properties the holy God the Holy Ghost the holy word it's sacred in itself some things are sacred because we set it apart to be used for sacred purposes then the act of setting that apart the act of keeping it separated is sanctifying or sanctified we've got that all right so let's let's let's do a little reading all right so we read in Leviticus chapter 20. that he says sanctify yourselves so let's look at this again Leviticus chapter 20 verse 7. sanctify yourselves therefore and be you holy for I am the Lord your God sanctify yourselves that means separate yourselves sanctify yourselves as not necessarily clean yourself up and make yourself perfect but sanctify yourself as separate yourself and designate yourself to God that means that separation from the world Amen so so whenever we obey the word of God because God's word is Holy whenever we come in obedience to the word of God Amen we are separating ourselves from something amen if God gives an idea or a concept about something whether it's the way we should conduct ourselves the way we should dress or who we should marry or who we should not marry if we get into that and God designates in his word amen then when we make the choice to obey the word we are now sanctifying ourselves are setting ourselves apart from the wrong idea and aligning to the right idea which is God's holy word and we have Sanctified ourselves we haven't purified ourselves we can't purify ourselves but we consecrate ourselves and set ourselves aside to the word of God we've come we've separated to the word separated from the world you say well we're either in the world or we're separated from the world I would say it this way we are separating from the world Choice by choice thought by thought obedience by obedience command by command we are separating from the world and maintaining our Separation by the choices that we make just like we keep this place consecrated and Sanctified for the use we keep it hallowed and holy for the purpose of worshiping God we have to keep it sanctified and so he says sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy which means to be you sacred or set apart so separate yourselves and be separate for I am the Lord your God and you shall keep my statutes and do them I I am the Lord which sanctify you so now do we sanctify ourselves or does God sanctify us the answer is amen we are we are to separate from the world's idea and take God's word amen we sanctify ourselves to obey his word amen but but God is the one who sanctifies us because unless he separates us out we'll never be separated unless he calls us unless he designates us we will never be a separated people we can never be a holy people unless he sanctifies us but he says sanctify yourselves and be holy how can I be holy if my if I have to be sinlessly perfect with no flaw in order to be holy how can I be holy no I am separating myself and I am staying connected with God so I'm sanctifying myself and being holy because he Sanctified me praise God it is it is very much has to do with positioning if we can see that I think it would help let's go to Second Chronicles 35. second chronicles second chronicles 35 and verse 3. now when I go through this I'm going to be talking about uh legalism I'm talking about old-fashioned Holiness ideas and all that and I don't want one person in here to get the wrong idea because when it comes to my personal conduct and what I believe amen I am very tight because I believe what God Said God meant and I believe what the prophet taught is exactly what God wants for us so the standard that we preach will never change amen but the what I'm trying to point out is keeping a standard is not make you holy legalism can never make you holy so just because I have preached against one thing doesn't mean I've changed my mind my I in fact the closer I get to God the tighter that standard becomes for me amen because of what God's doing in my life as I separate and the more that I separate the more I see what was there so at some point there's the the world has influence over us and and you there's certain things we just don't see that's why we have to be patient with new Believers amen we have to be patient with our teenagers sometimes is because new Believers just don't see it takes separation sometimes to bring vision and as we obey the word then we see amen and then when we separate we see as Israel separated more and more they begin to see the fallacy of Egypt but early on when they first went into a trial they said let's go back to Egypt it was pretty good there so as we separate more it actually doesn't bring a locksness in our life or a lowering of the standard for me personally what it's done is given me a Clear Vision on why that's wrong what's the spirit behind it why did the prophet teach it and it makes me in my heart have a desire Amen to stay consecrated and stay separated from the world it in no way ever makes me want to say well yeah it doesn't really matter I mean that's not really going to make you holy so this doesn't matter everything matters everything matters if we could understand that everything matters to God what we say what we look at what we hear how we speak how we dress how we carry ourselves the attitudes of our heart everything matters we'll never get to the place where it doesn't matter it matters what I want to do is not chase the wrong thing and try to obtain an unattainable goal I want to find out what God meant by these things and and I want to follow after that so second chronicles 35 and 3. and said unto the Levites that taught all Israel which were holy unto the Lord put the holy Ark and uh unto the Lord put the holy Ark in the house which Sodom and my son David king of Israel did build so I just want the first part of that phrase to catch something and he said unto the Levites that taught all Israel which were holy which were holy unto the Lord the Levites were holy unto the Lord what makes the Levites holy unto the Lord was not that they were born holy as far as sinless and and it's even not that the Levites lived with no flaw do you believe that the Levites uh different than the other 11 tribes that the other 11 tribes constantly had struggles but the Levites didn't have any struggle and the 11 they constantly made mistakes but the Levites because they were holy unto the Lord and told to be holy they never failed they never sinned they never made a mistake they never did anything wrong that's foolish amen what made them holy is God separated them out from the twelve and said you will be priest amen this is your job because they were separated by God they were holy that's what made them holy is their separation not their not necessarily that they were born into a perfect family and had perfect conduct all of their lives amen the Levites failed like every other tribe failed the Levites had sin like every other tribe had sin even God would designate a high priest and that high priest would be be Holiness unto God he would be the most holy of the Levites would be the high priest what made him the most holy is because he was the only one chosen for that office it did not make him sinlessly perfect amen and he did not have to come to sinless Perfection to be the high priest he was high priest because God chose listen Israel was holy because God chose Israel they were set apart from all the other nations that made them a holy nation if you read the history it it was not because they were perfect it was not because they never made a mistake it was not because they got it all right and they've completely understood everything God wanted they failed and failed and failed and failed what made them a holy nation is because God chose them amen he chose Abraham he chose Abraham's seed he called them out amen and called and they were a holy nation because they were separated unto God then out of that Nation he chose one family Levi Amen to Bear the ark to take care of the vessels to be the priest and out of that one family that one tribe he chose one family one man Aaron and his descendants to be the high priest so it was Aaron the most well-behaved of the Levites and the Levites the most well-behaved of the Israelites and the Israelites the most well-behaved of the world the answer is no God chose them and separated them out they chose Levi and separated him out then he chose Aaron and separated him out amen and Aaron was the high priest and this becomes evident because on the day of atonement Aaron as the most holy priest unto God had to put on all the holy garments and go before God and offer an atonement for the nation he was the he was to give a sacrifice that would cover for the sins of all the people and he's the only one that can do it but before he offered that sacrifice he had to offer a sacrifice for himself for his sins and the sins of his family so was the high priest perfect absolutely not or else he would never have to precede the the uh uh sacrifice of atonement for the nation without making a sacrifice for himself it proves that he was not perfect he had to make a sacrifice for himself and for his household then when he was accepted by making this sacrifice then he could make a sacrifice for the whole nation so what made him holy is God chose him and set him apart that's what made him holy without that he had no hope if it wasn't for that he had no hope but God knew let's go to uh Jeremiah chapter 2. Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 1. in Jeremiah chapter 2 verse 1. it says moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus saith the Lord I remember Thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou witnessed after me in the wilderness and the land that was not soon Israel was Holiness unto the Lord and the first fruits of his increase Israel was Holiness unto the Lord how did Israel become Holiness unto the Lord and the Wilderness he goes I remember back when I first brought you out of Egypt when you followed after me in the wilderness and that day Israel was Holiness unto the Lord what did it mean for Israel to be Holiness unto the Lord what it meant was Israel was separated to the Lord that word Holiness that's there is Kurdish and it means a Partners Holiness sacredness separateness so what made them Holiness unto the Lord is that they were separated from Egypt they were separated from All Nations they were drawn into the Wilderness and they were dedicated consecrated separated unto God they were holding us unto the Lord and it I mean you've read the Wilderness Journey right we've read the murmings and the complaints and the backslidings and the turning back and the Disobedience you've read all of that amen so when he says Israel was Holiness unto the Lord it wasn't Israel Pious dressed right looking nice saying amen just right doing everything perfect it was not that way because Israel was murmuring about no bread murmuring about no water blaming Moses and blaming God for no me and saying that we should go back to Egypt and when God gave them bread he said only take this much don't take more they took more and it turned into they disobeyed constantly they murmured they complained but Israel was Holiness unto the Lord because God selected the mountain called them to himself and they were separated people unto him praise God is good let's go back to Exodus chapter 30. we'll read in Exodus for a little bit Exodus chapter 13. first 34. this is the the instructions that God has given Moses in making the special incense that will be burned on the altar of incense so in Chapter 30 verse 34 these are in the destructions he gives and the Lord said to Moses take unto these sweet spices stacked in Annika and I don't know what all they are galbonum these sweet spices with pure frankincense of eat shall there be a light way and ye shall and thou shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the Apothecary tempered together pure and holy and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put of it before the testimony in the Tabernacle of the congregation where I will meet with thee it shall be unto you most holy and as for the perfume which Thou shalt make ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord so he calls this perfume holy holy it is it is Holy for the Lord amen and this is such an interesting uh statement he says make it he gives them he gives the recipe amen add so much of this and so much of this beat it small and burn it there you shall not make like this to burn in your homes this is Holy of the Lord which means you can't you can't use it for any other purpose you can't use it in any other way amen it didn't make the spices come down from heaven amen it did not make them sacred or holy in themselves they didn't have Holiness in themselves frankincense isn't holy in itself amen murder is not holy in itself these are spices anybody can pick up and use in something else I mean they can use it and whatever they use it they can spice up a chicken I don't know what they would use it for it's not holy and sacred in itself it's holy and sacred in its purpose so so when I say the Holy Ghost it's holy and sacred in itself when I say the holy incense the incense is not holy and sacred in itself it's holy and sacred in its purpose we understand so he's saying you make this and you use it there don't make anything like this for any other purpose this is Holy of the Lord when God called Israel out he wanted Israel for his purpose to serve his purpose and they were Holiness unto the Lord not holy in themselves but Holiness unto the Lord praise God let's go to Exodus 28. I hope this is making the picture clearer bit by bit like I said I do not want to make a simple subject complicated I want to keep it simple so Exodus 28 verse 1. and take that one to the Aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of Israel and he may Minister unto me in the priest's office even Aaron nadab and abahu Eliezer and ithamar Aaron's sons and thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for Glory and for beauty so here he's making him holy garments is the linen holy is the hit linen sacred no it's made sacred because of its purpose it's now holy garments because these garments are only to be used on the right priesthood in the right service of the temple that makes them holy garments see they're so far we're talking about Holiness and we haven't even started talking about conduct yet we're talking about positioning and purpose and calling and selection and being set apart amen let's go to verse 35. and it shall be upon Aaron to minister and his sound shall be heard when you go within and unto the holy place before the Lord and when he cometh out that he die not and thou shall make a plate of pure gold and Grave upon it like the Engravings of a Signet Holiness to the Lord so when Aaron would go into the holy of holies he had a holy garment to put on he had he had holy anointing oil amen he he was when when Aaron was being dressed to go into the holy of holies he was being sanctified before he's out with the family he's at home he's doing whatever he's doing but in order to go into the holy of holies he had to be Sanctified so the act of sanctifying him was separating him from his brother separating from the people and preparing him for his purpose that was what they were doing to sanctify him so they put on him the linen amen they they put on him the uh the anointing oil he had to have the Holy garments he had to have the Holy miter and a golden plate on the miter that said Holiness unto the Lord he had to be separated from his brethren in dress and anointing and calling in purpose and he was holy unto God and he would go into the holy Place amen with a with a gold plate on his head that said Holiness unto the Lord amen he wasn't holy within himself he was made holy for his purpose he was Sanctified to do what God wanted him to do and he was Sanctified prepared set apart amen and moved into his purpose and it was Holiness unto the Lord for the whole nation was Holiness unto the Lord the whole act the whole Temple the whole worship everything was pointing to one thing we are separated we are dedicated we are consecrated to you and that was Holiness unto the Lord let's go to verse 40. and for Aaron's sons thou shall make coats and thou shalt make for them girdles and Bond as thou shall make for them glory and for beauty and thou shalt put upon upon them Aaron thy brother and his sons with him and shalt anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them that they may Minister unto me in the priest's office amen these were not better people than other people they were Sanctified and consecrated and made holy for a purpose I hope you can see yourself I hope you can begin to see that if if Aaron would leave this priest office and Aaron would take off his garments and he would go home for the night and if Aaron's wife said something to him and he got sharp with her and said something that made her cry and hurt his feelings now was he no longer qualified to be a high priest because he's supposed to be holy it wasn't just his conduct that made him holy it was his separation it was his purpose it was his placing it was God calling him it was it that's what made him holy if he stayed in that purpose and he stayed in his conquered Consecration and he kept coming under the purification and the anointing and the right garments in the right place in his position and he kept doing what God called him to do amen and he kept offering sacrifices for his failures he would remain holy unto the Lord he was not he was not trying to obtain Holiness he was staying in Holiness because Holiness was his separation unto his office his position and he had to maintain that by sanctifying himself if he failed he had to give a transgress offering but he didn't amen he didn't he didn't he didn't no longer become Unholy amen he was holy because God chose him let's go to to Exodus 19. Exodus 19 and verse 9. and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a thick Cloud that the people may hear when I speak with thee and believe thee forever and Moses told the words of the people and to the Lord and the Lord said unto Moses go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their clothes and be ready against the third day for the third day the Lord will the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai so God tells Moses I'm going to come down and address his people you sanctify the people tell them to wash their clothes be separated be prepared for the third day they were sanctifying themselves in preparation to meet God and what were they doing they were just obeying what they were told to do amen so that's how they sanctify themselves to separate themselves and prepare themselves to meet with God now look at look at verse 23. and Moses said unto the Lord the people cannot come up to Mount Sinai for thou charges us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it so here we have the same word sanctify the people tell them to wash their clothes separate themselves and be set apart and be ready for the third day and now he tells them to sanctify the mountain did they wash the mountain did they put anointing oil on it how did they sanctify this mountain they put a barrier around it and wouldn't let anybody go up there and it was reserved and set apart and separated for God it was sanctified then the people when they were Sanctified they were given instructions in their sanctification to wash their clothes to set themselves apart and prepare themselves for the third day they were obeying the word setting themselves apart to meet God and the mountain was Sanctified set apart that this sanctification doesn't mean they washed it they scrubbed the bushes they they they sectioned it off so nobody could get on there and it was separated for gone the people were prepared by sanctifying themselves to meet God and you can see this is both sanctification both of this is sanctifying something so we realized that the real purpose to sanctify is to get something consecrated and separated for God's use amen and when it comes into that place where it's set apart for God it's now holy amen let's go to Exodus 20. and verse 8. remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy this is a day not a person not God this is a day but you're to keep it holy how do you keep a day how do you make a day holy you set it apart and you leave it for God's purpose amen remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days shout thou labor and do all thy work but in the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou shalt do thou shall not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man servant nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor the stranger is within thy gates for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth and sea and all that's in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day and hallowed it so this word uh when it says remember this Habit to keep it holy and hallowed are the same word and these are the exact same Hebrew word that is translated sanctify for the people washing their clothes and sanctify to sanctify the mountain and holy for the day and hallowed for the day it's all the same thing what is it it is set apart and dedicated for a purpose set apart and dedicated for a purpose amen praise God so brother bam says now what shall we do in the message what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ he said a Nazarite is one one that separates themselves for the word of God not short wearing painted face Jezebels calling themselves Christians no sir man so wishy-washy that'll stand for a denomination and hold on to their coattails of some Caesar or Herod instead of standing for the word of God but God has got loyal people genuine flock of God who don't care what the world says they believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen let's turn to Numbers chapter six and I want to read about the Nazarite vow and see what the Lord said brother Birmingham said a Nazarite is one who separates themselves for the word of God and you'll find that brother Branham is going to pull this term Nazarite and pull it out of the Old Testament and even change the requirements for a Nazarite in the Old Testament and bring it into the believer today and so let's let's understand what this is in Numbers chapter 6 verse 1. and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to a vow a vow of a Nazarite so what's this it's a separation to separate themselves unto the Lord so they have separated themselves unto the Lord let's keep reading he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the colonels even to the husk and all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow all the days that he separated himself unto the Lord he shall come at no dead body he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for a sister when they die because the because the consecration of his God is upon his head all the days of his separation he is Holy unto the Lord so this Nazarite he is going to be he's taking a vow of Separation he's separating from everything and he is dedicating and consecrating himself unto God for a period of time amen and when he does that he is called holy unto the Lord why is he holy unto the Lord well it's obvious brother Chad he didn't cut his hair and he didn't drink wine and it it's not his actions it's not the Deeds that make him holy it's the fact that he consecrated and separated himself to the Lord that made him holy unto the Lord amen it wasn't that he drank wine or didn't drink wine because when Jesus came he drank wine but he was he was holy unto the Lord right it wasn't that he cut his hair didn't cut his hair those were all part of the Nazarite vow when he wanted to separate himself amen he would go through a process of consecrating himself or sanctifying himself where he would do the things that God said do to enter into this period where he is dedicated holy to the Lord and God would say he is Holy to the Lord he is Holy to me because he is set apart for me for this period of time only not for work not for family not for anything else he is dedicated to me and that made him holy I hope we're understanding Holiness a little better Holiness is not long hair long skirt keeping conduct rules that's not holiness that can be part of it but Holiness is a separation to God a dedication to God brother Benham said in God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief it says no matter what the price the world has to say about it out there or how many scornful or laughters are critics that doesn't bother a person that's totally separated from the things of the world to the things of God they obey the word and separate themselves from the things of the world because the word separates them this is so important to know that we can't just say I'm going to take a Nazarite vow and I'm not going to work and I'm not going to uh go home to my family but I'm going to the woods and I'm going to pray amen that's not necessarily what we're talking about he says here's what brother bear says in the same message a little further down he says but when a man is born in the world for a Believer he becomes a Nazarite when he separates himself from anything that's contrary to the word what what is it to be a Nazarite in this day it is not to let your locks grow long it is not to not eat this and not drink that and not touch a dead body that's not what it means in this day in this state to be a Nazarite means that you you stay far away from anything that's contrary to the word you don't touch it you don't partake of it amen but you consecrate and dedicate yourself for the word that's what it means to be a Nazarite and if you're a Nazarite you're holy unto the Lord is what he says a Nazarite is Holy unto the Lord amen and what separates us not our thinking not our ideas not our own standard not our own Traditions that's not what separates us what separates us is the word so brother Graham says the word is what separates us because automatically when the word comes forth amen when the word comes forth then we make a choice on the word if we choose the word then there's something we didn't choose if we say yes to this there's something else we say no to it's like a woman when she's being courted amen she may have in a young sister she may have had a couple different brothers that were interested in her and Friends of her and talking to her amen and but if if one of them comes up and says will you marry me what he's saying is will you sanctify and consecrate yourself to be holy unto me that's what he's asking her because when they take the vow they says will you will you separate from all else holding only unto thee he's asking her would you sanctify and consecrate yourself and be holy unto me and if she says yes then she automatically separated herself and said no to the other suitors it wasn't is it this this separation and being holy to God is not our concept or our idea or or a set of things that we think that would be better no it is saying yes to the word when we say yes to the word we say no to the world and the things that are of the world and when the word show when God shows us through the word through the ministry of a prophet through the scriptures what his desire is and we say yes to that we've said no to that and then we begin to consecrate and sanctify ourselves to that word to do what to obey it amen because when you recognize that God said amen for a woman to wear clothes that's Abomination that pertain to a man it's an Abomination to God then you says I say yes to that when you said yes to that you said no to all kinds of other fashions and then when you Sanctified yourself to that word you had to actually go in your closet and take the garments down put them in a sack and throw them away or take them to Goodwill or whatever you did with them and what were you doing you were sanctifying yourself not because you thought well I think it's more pleasing to God to wear blue than khaki no you chose the word when you saw the word you said yes to the word when you said yes to the word you separated from something to unite with something and when you did you Sanctified yourself unto that purpose and when you Sanctified yourself into that purpose for the word you were becoming holy unto the Lord because you were separating from the world and coming to his word and he is the word it wasn't it wasn't the Garment that made you holy amen it was the Consecration and dedication to God that made you holy are we starting to see the dividing line because a lot of people brother Benham said you can have long hair and a skirt and all these other things and he said enough temper to fight a buzz soul there's still something wrong that's not holiness right we can we can have uh we can have conduct order and Doctrine let's just say and still not have Holiness because what we've done is not just take the word and separate to unite with the person of the word what we're doing is we're keeping a standard of a church to conform to a church or for whatever motivation we have for doing that but that doesn't equal holiness you say why do you dress that way because I'm part of a Holiness Church you understand how foolish that statement is the only way that you can be part of Holiness is to be wholly dedicated to God the only way you can be holy is to be holy surrendered to God that's the only way to be holy not to wear a certain type of garment uh not to the the to speak in a certain way and fellowship with certain kinds of people you can do all of those things and not be holy so they cannot be equal to holiness but what can be equal to Holiness a surrender to the word of God can be equal to holiness would it change the way you dress without a shadow of a doubt will you consecrate yourself to that word without a shadow of a doubt will you separate from the things of the world without a shadow of a doubt amen because you chose the word that make and you've separated from everything to the word You Are Holy unto the Lord amen that will change everything because because it changes everything when God when God called out Aaron to be the high priest amen God gave him special garments God gave him special anoint anointing God gave him a special miter he gave him all of these things and and God calling him made him holy and all these garments were holy and everything was holy but what if somebody from the tribe of God would come on and put on holy garments and put on holy perfume and take a holy miter and take the holy incense would it make them holy unto the Lord absolutely not amen they can't be holy unto the Lord by copying somebody else that's holy unto the Lord nobody else in Israel could take Aaron's place and be holy unto the Lord they would become an Abomination because they weren't called to that position so you cannot be holy by copying somebody else's holiness what is the only thing that can make us holy is to surrender completely to the word take the position he's called us into listen we cannot make ourselves holy into the Lord by any action by any conduct by any idea by empty acknowledgment out of our mouth because first in order to be holy unto the Lord you have to be chosen by the Lord and if you're not chosen by the Lord you'll never be holy unto the Lord Israel had to be chosen before they could be holy their choosing is what made them holy when they consecrated themselves and gave themselves over they were holy unto the Lord uh Levi had to be chosen Aaron had to be chosen first they have to be chosen and for you to be holy unto the Lord first you must be chosen you must be part of the elect predestinated bride of Jesus Christ you must be chosen and when you're chosen you must surrender to that position because Aaron had to surrender Moses had to surrender Israel had to surrender see when we look at this with this subject it's so perfect because it is not like you'd look at the subject of Holiness and say that's all that's all up to me it's up to me I've got to do this and I've got to do that you can't do nothing unless God called you all your efforts will be wasted but neither can you say well it's up to God I'll sit here if he wants to be holy he'll make me holy it's not that way either so what is holiness when God choosing me gives me a revelation of what God wants and I surrender to God that equals holiness there are things I have to give up things I have to choose things I have to lay down I must sanctify myself I must dedicate myself I must consecrate myself but I'll tell you what all the giving up and all the consecrating when we equal nothing unless he first has called me and consecrated me and dedicated me to himself there's two parts to this equation we can't have it all over here or all over here it's right here in the middle God calls God designates God has a position in placing for each one of us when we step into that and surrender to that and give our whole lives to the word of God we can now become Holiness unto the Lord praise God almighty brother bam says in the Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says he proves his resurrection life then as he vindicates himself she the bride is independent from all others she's an independent woman a Great Speckled Bird that's different from all others you remember the Bible and that the Great Speckled Bird but she had his name she had his life how did they speckle the bird they were both white then they pulled the head off of one bird and drained the blood out on the other bird and the other bird speckled with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy as it made the ground so Christ the dead mate put his blood his blood from his life into a Sprinkle carrying his blood crying holy holy holy unto the Lord it's an odd looking bird sure it is but she the bride is identified by him that's so important she's identified not by herself she's identified by him should identify by them and she is independent from all others keep thee only under her as long as you both live keep thee only unto him the word no adultery not one sign of denomination not one sign of creed no adultery at all the word and him alone on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds is sinking sand said Airy perronet that's it Christ the word he was the word he is the word and the church becomes the word by him making her a part of him and that's the word again personally identified by him his property alone his property alone I say if she is his property alone she is Holy unto the Lord if that's his property alone she is Holy unto the Lord she is Redeemed by him through him for him and for him alone that's right then what the devil is howling about that it's being revealed what is the what is the problem is that she's coming to this realization of what true Holiness is amen she's Redeemed by him for him to him and him alone what's that mean is she a Sanctified consecrated dedicated to him she is given holy to him she is now holy unto him making her a holy bride not holy because of her conduct not only because of her action holy because he chose her for himself and she surrendered to him now she is a holy bride and do you think that Holy bride who has been selected called by him by him for him to him and him alone she can't be anything else but a holy bride and then if she has heard the call and heard the word and separated from every other idea separated from every other concept separated from every other tradition separated from everything and United to her headship to Christ then she is a holy bride do you think if she goes out tomorrow and makes a mistake and fails that she is no longer a holy bride do you think she's no longer chosen by God you think she's no longer predestinated or elected no but she must sanctify herself and keep herself sanctified she must come back through repentance and stay connected to Christ she's not Holy by title only right Jesus I mean God he designated a People Israel they were as holy people they were holding us unto the Lord he wanted to to to use them to demonstrate himself but when they backslid and left him he allowed them to get taken into bondage and taken far away amen it looked terrible but God never forgot his people and he brought them back God will never forget his chosen elect bride do we make mistakes absolutely we make mistakes but how have we lost our position only if we're not elect we have to sanctify ourselves but in sanctify ourselves will never make us a holy bride if he didn't call us to be a holy bride let's turn to the New Testament I'm going to look at a few scriptures in New Testament let's go to Second Thessalonians foreign Thessalonians chapter 2. and we're going to read verse 13. second Thessalonians 2 and 13. for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effects he worketh also in you that believe for ye Brethren became followers of the churches of God which are in I'm sorry I did it again I'm in first Thessalonians I would love it if something Supernatural would happen now and I could look back and say that was because of this not just because I can't read second Thessalonians 2 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved to the Lord because God has from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth God has chosen you into salvation through sanctification of spirit and belief of the truth and this word sanctification means consecration or purification it's used in the Bible to mean sanctification and holiness brother Branham picked up this term this word here and here's how he described him he says in the future home he says now let me take this board just a minute and he's drawing something on the Blackboard here is a human heart I'm a long ways from being an artist here is a human heart and here's a human heart he's got two human hearts now this one over here has a snake in it that sin here he has his life this one over here is a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has here he has life well this one here he has malice hatred Envy that's what's causing it is this fellow here well this one over here has love and joy and long-suffering that's what does it down here now when you're asked or you are forgiven of your sins you're only done this taking that away taken the sin the hatred malice and all that away but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there notice when you repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins notice then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service brother goes through this and it goes through this in the New Birth that first we're Justified amen then we're Sanctified cleans and set aside for service then he goes on he says the next comes the baptism of the fire of the Holy Ghost and God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us so he begins to tell us that we have justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sanctification is cleansed amen by the spirit of God and belief of the truth cleansed and set aside for service and then in the filling of the Holy Ghost we're put into service uh there's a reason I'm getting into this I want to read this next quote in birth pains and so it is in the spiritual realm it's water justification by faith believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized second is sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in and gives New Birth and fills up that Sanctified vessel for instance like this now that I told you what what you don't believe lay aside and take he's talking about eating that cherry pie spitting out the seed take the pie now a glass is laying on the chicken yard you don't just pick that up and put it on your table and fill it up with water or milk no by picking it up it's justification cleansing it is sanctification because the Greek word sanctify is a compound word Mission clean cleanse and set aside for service not in service for service then when you fill it it's put in service so he starts telling the analogy of a glass that's in a hog pin and a manure pile and you pick it up that's justification that's God choosing it amen that's gone God's beginning the process of setting it apart amen if God didn't choose you you're not chosen amen you can't choose yourself no man can come to me lest the father draws him amen it's got to be God doing the drawing for us to even come to him so when he picks you up what's he doing he's beginning the whole process of setting you apart he's separating you from the world he's pulling you to himself amen he's beginning the whole process then what he does by the washing of the water of the word he begins to wash and Purge and clean that glass so that he can use it for a purpose then when it's all cleaned amen and ready he'll fill that glass amen when you take a natural glass you'll feel it and you'll set it on the table and use it for a drinking glass you'll use it for a purpose that's what God is doing with each one of us amen he is drawing us to himself he's choosing us selecting us setting us apart from the world first he grabs a hold of us by drawing us to himself he claims us for his own your mind we're redeemed then he begins to clean us and sanctify us amen and what's he doing he's dedicating us preparing us by the word for a service and then he's putting us into service what is that whole process Holiness unto the Lord being set aside and used for his purpose the same thing he did with the high priest the same thing he did with Israel to say he he is he is redeeming cleansing sanctifying and putting in the service that is holiness unto the Lord now let's look at First Peter First Peter chapter 2. just want to go just just a little bit further just a few more scriptures First Peter chapter 2. verse 9. but you are our chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which have not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy the first part of this verse 9 he's using language that is almost identical to the way God spoke about Israel when God selected Israel out of all Nations and he chose them for his own purpose and he Sanctified them unto himself by pulling them out of Egypt and redeeming them amen and he intended to clean them up all the way and put them in the service to take back the land amen and so God had a purpose and a plan for that but now he says you who are not a people you're not is or you were not a people amen are now become as people but he said you're a chosen generation verse 9 a royal priesthood a holy nation he's talking to dispersed Gentiles amen Gentiles that were heathens Gentiles that were pagans Gentiles that that knew not God Amen and they've come to the to the knowledge of Jesus Christ they've come to the gospel message and he says you're a holy nation amen and it's amazing that he called them a holy nation because there was still so much growing they needed to do Peter began to talk to our Paul began to talk to them and admonish them in Corinthians and talk to them about their immaturity and the wrong use of gifts and and sin that they let in the church there was so much that was still wrong with this this people this fledgling Christian church but Peter looks at them and says you are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood you are a holy nation amen and that's the same thing God did to Israel You Were My Chosen you were my redeemed I redeemed you you were my firstborn amen then he calls levite You Are Holy unto me he calls Aaron You Are Holy unto me amen there was a whole lot of work that needed to be done to them a whole lot of cleaning up that still needed to take place in their lives and meant a whole lot of sanctification separation and dedication there was a lot of things they needed to learn about God and line up to but it didn't change the fact that he called them to be a holy nation and in this early fledgling Church there was a whole lot Paul had to set straight in the gospels there was a lot of correction that needed to take place a lot of wrong understanding and a misuse of things but they were still a chosen generation they were still a royal priesthood as much as levite was a priesthood would always be a priesthood because of God's designation this too is a royal priesthood a holy nation that's why this Bride is a holy bride and you can look at that and you can look in the mirror and you could say I'm no holy bride I did this and I've done that you're looking at the wrong place you need to look in this mirror you need to look to what God has called to himself that God has designated to himself that God has chosen for himself Hey listen levite was not a tribe that had a tremendous blessing on them even Isaac at his death when he when he spoke the blessing over his children and Levi he reminded levite that he was cruel in the way that he dealt with a nation amen when he when they tricked him when he and his brother tricked them into circumcision then went in and killed them all lied to them deceived them and killed them all and Israel said you make me stink amongst other people levite wasn't chosen because he was the nicest boy and the nicest tribe he was chosen because he was God's choice and God didn't choose you to be in the bride because you were the nicest person how many how many of us wish we were nicer I mean you see another brother and he's so friendly he's got that gregorious personality and everybody loves me around him when he walks in the room people stand ah brother and they hug you and you walk in the room they're like hi some people have Magnetic Personality some people don't some people are so smooth and easy some people are a little rough and you look at this when you compare and we error comparing ourselves among ourselves and we think that brother's made it but I haven't and you know and we start to judge based off what we see and not judge based off what God has chose you are a holy people you say but you don't know what I did yet yesterday if God has chose you if you're elected bride if you're the seat Gene of God call for this day you're a holy people what is it we need to do we need to surrender we need to consecrate ourselves to that word God has done his part by calling us he's done his part by identifying Us in the word now we must do our part by choosing no to everything that's not the word and saying yes to everything that is the word and consecrating ourselves to this word to come into what he's already told us we are it's not this Holiness is not something we attain to through sinless perfection this Holiness is something he's called us to by positional placement let's go to Ephesians chapter 5. very familiar to all of us but so necessary in this teaching Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25. Ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for him that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrink or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish God wants a spotless wrinkle-free bride yes is that what he wants so God will present to himself a bride without Sparta wrinkle he's not asking the bride to present herself without spot her ankle read this correctly because if we read this wrong we go back to Nazarene understanding we go back to Pentecostal Holiness understanding he didn't ask the bride to present herself spotless and wrinkle free he said he will present himself a bride without spot or wrinkle or any such thing how's he going to do it he's going to wash her how's he going to wash her with the washing of the Water by the word God has sent the washing in this day God has sent the purifying in this day he has sent the Waters of Separation that separate us from the world and to himself Amen in the in the Old Testament they had a water of separation and it was made with the ashes of a red heifer they were told to take a red heifer without spot without blemish and Perfection go outside the camp burn the red heifer take the ashes mix it with water and every vessel in the Tabernacle was Sanctified was cleansed by the ashes of the red Heaven the water was sprinkled on it and it was determined clean the water without the water of sprinkling it was not yet ready for service although it was ordained for service it was ordained it was made according to what God said it was it was separated unto its service but it must be Sanctified how was it Washed by the ashes of a red heifer the Waters of Separation that separated it to God's purpose so how was God cleansing his Temple through the waters of separation through the word God sent a word in this day a pure word a clean word a perfect word and that word is the word that is washing his bride so that he can present to himself a bride without spot a wrinkle he's not asking us to jump through hoops he's not setting the bar higher and higher and higher what he's done is he's called us to himself he's told us we're a holy nation he told us we're A peculiar people that were his holy bride and then he is bringing a washing of water that will make us everything he said we are if we will surrender to the word remember there's the two parts again there's the part God does and there's a part we do brother Bram says in broken sisters to me he is the Waters of the word of Separation that separates you from everything that's contrary to his word that's the fountain I believe him to be yes sir that's the waters that separated me from the man-made sister who's the Fountain of Living Water and the seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy he says and the Holy Spirit is our circumcision it's God's sharp knife it separates and cuts off the surplus of the Flesh of the world from us the word of God sharper than a two-edged sword so you see come right back again the word of God is the thing that the Holy Spirit uses not Creeds not denominations but the word is what separates us from the things of the world it cuts away our ideas and things and holy consecrates us to God if the word Cuts away the world and we stay surrendered to the word it cuts away the world and keeps us holy consecrated to God what's the word doing the word is sanctifying us the word is cleansing us the word is purging us the word is purifying us the word is sanctifying us to bring us into that position of holiness he's gone and the message here ye him he says this is the washing of the water of Separation by the word the word what washes us and cleanses us sanctify he says sanctify them Father through the truth said Thy word is truth is that right and we're washed of the Waters of the separation from our sins by the word of God the word separates us and sets us in place now listen we have to we we want to recognize what he's talking about he's not talking about playing a tape and so I play the tape and now I'm washed that makes sense I read my Bible I read the church age book now I'm clean it's not the hearing it's the surrender to it's The Obedience it's the surrender he brings the word you can't bring the word you can't wash yourself he has to do the washing but you must surrender to the word that's your choice praise God I want to read uh Matthew chapter 15. together Matthew chapter 15. foreign oh my yeah Matthew 15-1 says then he came to then came Jesus came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do this disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they washed not their hands when they eat bread so here come the Pharisees the good old Pharisees and they were trying to be strict and keep all the ordinances and the traditions of the fathers to be acceptable unto God but the thing is where they were completely unaccepted by God because they didn't accept God they accept traditions and rules and they had all kinds of washing pots and washing this and rituals and ceremony they had all kinds of things that looked great with tons of effort that made it look clean and made it look holy but they were not accepted by God because they didn't accept God right they were trying to do something right so then they start to criticize the disciples why do your disciples eat with unwashed hands why don't they keep the tradition of the fathers and Jesus gives them a wonderful answer in verse 17. he says do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out the drawn but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart perceive evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications theft false witness blasphemies all of a sudden Jesus taught him a very valuable lesson you're worried about a man defiling himself by eating with unwashed hands it's not the eating with what not what goes into a man that defiles him it's what comes out of his heart that defiles him it's the condition of the heart being expressed is what's defiling the man not what he's putting in but what's coming out amen so God Christ is showing them that what you need is a change in your heart amen not all of these ordinances to try to keep everything outside from coming inside you need the thing that really defiles a man is the wickedness inside coming outside that's what defiles it amen this is the fallacy of the Holiness movement this is the fallacy of any legalistic movement the Pharisee movement the Holiness movement the the fallacy is that we can weaken through conduct and Order keep any evil from coming in and defiling ourselves we dress right talk right go to church do all these things and and we don't watch anything and we don't we don't listen to any bad thing we don't do any bad thing we won't let any bad thing come in the problem is the thing that's defiling you is unregenerate hearts the thing that's defiling you is not being born again the thing that is corrupting you is that which is coming out of you amen you need the word to come in and be a sanctifying process and the Holy Ghost to come in and burn out all of that and bring you into the position the word has for you amen that's why putting on will never work that's why doing will never work amen it's got to be his doing our surrender to his doing that will come in and bring a change on the inside because the corruption that is in man is in the heart of man so I rule keeping won't do it but I tell you one thing if the Holy Fire of God has burned out the old nature and burn out the old men and the seed of God has sprung to life amen and you become Holiness unto the Lord it'll change the way you dress it'll change the way you talk it'll change your attitudes and that which starts coming out of you will not be what defiles you but what comes out of you will be the very life of God will be coming out of your mouth amen when your kindness and your sweetness and your temperament change and all of these things that are taking place is because we've come surrendered to the word and it washed us and he purified us and he burned us and he changed us and then when we become Holiness unto the Lord we will dress holy talk holy walk holy think holy feel holy you understand that's the Holiness we need look at one more aspect as we depart as we finish in John chapter 17. this is the last thing I want to point out John 17. Jesus says John 17 verse 17. sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so what brings sanctification in our lives the truth what is this message the truth what did God bring us the truth and what will that truth do to us it'll sanctify us but it won't sanctify us if we push play and don't obey it won't sanctify us we just come to church and go home and no surrender it won't sanctify the washing of the water of the word does it wash just because these ears heard the word it'll wash when these ears hear the word and you say that ain't nothing but the truth and I'm going to give my life to it it takes both parts so he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have I sent them into the world for their sakes I sanctify myself this is such an interesting scripture for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth Jesus is saying for their sakes I sanctify myself and the question is did Jesus need cleansed did he need purified did he need perfected what what is Jesus saying for their sakes I sanctify myself he's he is the holy child he is the Holy One of Israel he is the holy God he is the Messiah what does he need to sanctify himself for he's the Holy One does anybody believe he's the Holy One of Israel then you would think he's already sanctified but what he's showing he's saying I am consecrating myself for their sakes and here's what brother Branham said about it in adoption he said that's one of the sweetest words that I ever heard father I sanctify myself for their sakes do you know he had a right to have a home he was a human he would have a right to a wife he was a man he had a right to all of these things he but he said father I sanctify myself for their sakes I sanctify myself I was talking to a little preacher yesterday going to preach for him in a few nights up here on the highway and I asked him about a certain thing he said yes brother Branham but most of my people doesn't believe in that I said I said most of all of them are legalists he said yes brother doesn't the brother doesn't believe that but he said for their sake I oh I wanted to hug his neck for their sake I sanctify myself for their sake here he's talking about a brother a minister and and brother Branham I don't know what the conversation was or what the challenge was but brother bear says he must have questioned why he did something and brother bam said he says brother most of my people don't believe that and brother Brenham said they're mostly legalist and the man said yes so there's there's a man with a congregation that congregation is struggling to believe something a certain way the man doesn't believe it that way but he's consecrated himself for their sakes he Sanctified himself he's dedicated himself to something for their sakes not even something he needs to do not even something he has to do but he did it for their sake he's got the right he knows the word he can go and do whatever he wants he's got the Liberty he's got the freedom amen he can go do it but he knows that it would challenge the people in the crowd they wouldn't understand it because of what they believed so he sanctifies himself for their sakes and brother bear said oh I wanted to hug his neck said sanctifying myself for there say oh Jesus was training 12 men that through these 12 men was to take the gospel to the world and he said for their sake I sanctify myself make make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else to say don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do he goes on in Fellowship he says I think the sweetest scripture there is in all the Bibles this scripture father I sanctify myself because of them he was a man he could have had a wife he was a man he could have had a home a place to lay his head he had a right to that he was a man he could have had good clothes he was a man but what did he say father I sanctify myself for their sake what was he doing he was training up 12 disciples that were going to preach the gospel in all the world he put on an example and Brethren as ministers I tell you it pays us not to get too much of the world's goods and things hanging around us you preachers I'm talking to sanctify yourselves for them that you're going to lead that's what we need today is a complete consecrated Sanctified life of ministers that walk upright before God does not entangle with the things of the world keep away from it father I sanctify myself for their sake for not because he had to do it but he did it for their sake can we do that for each other we can do that for the neighbor can we do that for the enemy can we do that for whoever he it wasn't that he was trying to obtain something it's not always that we have to get something from God or our reward from God sometimes we just keep ourselves in a certain place for the benefit of somebody else keep ourselves consecrated to God in a certain thing for somebody else's benefit for somebody else's welfare that's what Jesus did he didn't need to be purified he was the Holy One but he needed to keep himself consecrated and dedicated in a certain way for the ones that we're around him did he have Liberty yes are we a free people we're a free people will God cast us away amen with every mistake no he won't cast us away we have Liberty we have Liberty but let's not use Liberty as a cloak for maliciousness or selfishness but let's keep ourselves dedicated to the word keep ourselves dedicated to the Lord and to one another for each other's sake I'm going to read one more scripture Hebrews chapter 2. musicians you can go ahead and start making your way up Hebrews chapter 2 verse 10. for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bring many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of One for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren the one who's doing the sanctifying and the one who's being Sanctified are all of One whatever he is I am he's the bridegroom I'm the bride he's the word I'm the word the thing that's sanctifying and Mead who's being Sanctified are all one he has called us to our position in this day to be the bride and he's called us to be a holy bride a bride that set apart unto him what does it mean to be holy to be consecrated and set apart for the word to be dedicated and separated to the word that's what it means to be holy let's all stand Holiness is not necessarily to make ourselves perfect or pure through actions Deeds or restraints but to be holy unto the Lord means that we're chosen by God that he has called us and that we have surrendered to that and subjected ourselves to his word to be holy is to be wholly consecrated to the Lord amen can I do that and make a mistake you can do that and make a mistake can you be holy and still not have everything in your right set aside set up set right because you're still learning yes you can be holy and still learning like Israel was like the first church was you can be holy and still growing in your knowledge of the Lord and still be holy holy is not something you're going to come to someday holy is a position God's put you in and your surrender to that position and I said God help me to be consecrated to this word and to be holy unto the Lord amen God bless you I love you all man we're going to ask brother Alan and sister Tammy if you'd like to make your way around back and get prepared for the baptism you can do that at this time let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father I thank you Lord for your word God I pray God that you would help us all to understand Lord the thing that I was trying to preach Lord I pray you fill all gaps Lord and you correct any wrongs I pray you would plant in the heart of your children the correct understanding God that we wouldn't take old denominational ideas but we would look at your word what your Prophet has brought in this day what you've made us to be God may we understand what it is you want from our lives what it is you're looking for in US and may we give it to you Lord God I believe above all you're looking for a surrendered heart you're looking for someone that you have called who will surrender their life and lay down all thoughts and all ideas and come to that word to submit to it and to obey it God I want to be that kind of person I pray Lord that you would wash Us by the washing of the water of your word and separate us from all the wrong understanding and wrong desires that have plagued us all these years and go on through the revelation of your word that you would purchase from those things and that we would always have a desire Lord to surrender to everything that you show us and that we can be consecrated and dedicated unto you that you who have called us to Consecration and dedication will help us Lord we want to be holy unto you God I pray you bless your people that you would guide us that you would watch over us that you would protect us and use us for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all Blake ever soon Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary [Music] with Thanksgiving [Music] I'll be only living Thank you very much [Music] and Lord prepare me [Music] away [Music] pure and holy [Music] tried and true with Thanksgiving I'll be early [Music] take you away foreign [Music] God has always called his people to be holy God call the holy people to make a holy Temple and the holy God wouldn't dwell among them what made them holy was his choice and his presence when they chose not to go his way anymore he left his presence left and he let them go into bondage and let the temple be destroyed because it wasn't holy because of the fabric it wasn't holy because of the gold it was holy because of his selection his choosing his purpose and his presence foreign said it wasn't the Holy Mountain it was the holy God on the mountain that made it holy when Moses came to Jesus at a burning bush to take off your shoes for the ground you stand on his Holy Ground it wasn't the sand it wasn't the dirt it was the presence of God it was the place God chose and we by a revelation of the word in this day we can say we are a holy people we can say it without shame you can say it looking in the mirror you can say it knowing that there's some things in your life you wish were better there's some things you want to grow in but you can still to say we are a holy people not by my choice but by his choice we're a holy people because he called us to be a holy people and he's given us a word that'll sanctify and cleanse us and his presence is in his bride making it a holy people amen once you know that you're a holy vessel when you know it when you know that God has called you that God has washed you and that God is dwelling in you and you know that it's his intention for you and you surrender to that amen you may have a whole list of things that you wish were better and you may have a whole idea about how you'd like to change yourself but it doesn't change the fact you're a holy person [Music] and when you come to that realization I tell you friends it changes the way we live it changes the way we think it changes the decisions we make amen we need to realize what God has done for us in this day and where he's at who he is who we are and we can claim we can say by the grace of God I am a holy person God's called me to this position God's washed me in his word I with all that's in my heart surrendered to that and he has filled me with this spirit I am a holy person we are by God's grace a holy bride why does a holy person want to go act Unholy you don't once you realize you're a holy person and why does a holy person trying to be holy you're just a holy person not because we climb the ladder we outdid the Pharisees he chose us it was so simple he called I responded he did the rest and now because of that I want to consecrate myself for this purpose I want to dedicate myself to this purpose though I may have some Liberties and I may but I don't want to do anything that paints the wrong picture to anybody else I now consecrate myself to be a holy person for my neighbor for my co-worker for my brothers and sisters that's our desire oh what God has done for us is remarkable you are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood you are a holy nation now I just want to say thank you God amen like [Music] me [Music] pure and holy [Music] tried and true foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lord of all [Music] Jesus speaks [Music] Jesus speaks of all the kingdoms up my heart you may be seated Jesus I Surrender [Music] all [Music] Jesus [Music] surrender [Music] girl Jesus foreign [Music] [Music] oh Lord Jesus Jesus speaks the Lord of all Jesus speaks the Lord of all the kingdoms up amen this is a tremendous day wonderful to be here to observe this but it's wonderful for sister Tammy and brother Alan I had a chance to sit and talk with them yesterday and hear their story and what God's doing for them and it's just remarkable I just thank God how God knows how to reach down and find his seed and grab them and pull them to himself and then he hasn't quit searching amen he hasn't quit finding he hasn't quit calling so this is just a remarkable time they've been fellowshipping here with us for three or four months and the Lord just let them they've came and they've had questions they've had uh they wanted to know where God want them but God supernaturally has used brother Benjamin siebel and others in the assembly to to confirm where he wants them to be that they're on the right track and they know that the next step in their journey is baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so they're going to be obedient to the word of God and how many of you will pray for this couple that God will fill them with his Spirit according to his promise and lead them every step in his perfect will amen sister Tammy because you want to be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ and his death burial and resurrection and you've accepted his call for your life it's with joy I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ okay dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father for my sister I thank you God that you've called her Lord by your own calling by your own choosing by your own way you've made it personal and you made it specific for her and God she has obeyed your word in being baptized in your name and I pray God that you would keep your word in her life for you've promised Lord if she would repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that she shall be filled with the Holy Ghost I pray to fill her Lord let her light life be a light to the world and that shines forth from this vessel For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray amen unless you hold on to the ramp and now we have brother Alan God bless you brother the testimony is so amazing sister Tammy was raised as a child in the message she knew it but when they got married she left they were married brother Allen has no really no Church raising from the time he's a teenager he went and for years and years and years they just went on like that but when God's appointed time came God knows exactly where we're at amen we've never been lost God never lost track of us he knew where we were and so we were talking yesterday it was just interesting that he's never known the message never even raised in church and when God got a hold of me just got a hold of him and led him in this path and I asked sister Tammy I said what have you ever thought as a growing up as you know ever thought back to those years of the message and the truth and not going to church or doing anything and she says inside I always knew I would come back amen how is it that the seed always knows amen no matter where life is going and it was going to be her husband that was going to lead her back amen God is so good and so faithful we can rejoice in what he's done right here amen God bless you brother Allen because you've also accepted the call of the Lord and you've received him because you've obeyed you want to obey him and be baptized in his name it's also with joy I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ foreign dear Lord Jesus as I lay hands on my brother Alan Lord you have so supernaturally led him to this point you have guided him you've called him Lord I pray now that you would confirm your promise Lord for this promise is to us and to our children from our fathers to our children to as many as you should call and you have called so the promise is for my brother I pray to fill him with your spirit Lord you Quicken the seed within and Lord that he would live the life you've ordained for this time bless him shooting from all the fiery darts of the enemy and let his light shine in this world in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen thank you God bless you all Blake and what can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus [Music] what can make me roll again nothing but the blood of Jesus oh precious is that flow that makes me wide as known [Music] nothing but the blood of Jesus for my pardon this I see nothing but the blood of Jesus for my cleansing this my flee nothing but love
