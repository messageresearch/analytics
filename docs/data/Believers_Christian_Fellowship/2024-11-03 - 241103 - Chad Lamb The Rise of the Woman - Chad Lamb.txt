speak to your children in this hour for we're here to hear from you Lord may you lead us may you guide us may you be our Shepherd Lord as we need you we look to you for all things have your way with us Lord as we honor you honor you your word may you have preeminence this morning amongst us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning it's good to be here with you you again we thank God for another time another opportunity to worship together amen if you could turn with me while you're standing to Genesis chapter 3 just want to say God bless you to our visitors I saw brother Levi here God bless you brother Levi it's good to have you and brother Ben Yoda as well and his family and brother Arley God bless you all and anybody else who's visiting we see a few other visitors God bless you all you're very very welcome it's good to have you with us this morning anden as we look at Genesis chapter 3 together I want to begin with uh this verse and then we'll pick up another one and before we're seated Genesis CH 3 verse 16 Genesis 3:1 16 says unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee let's turn together to First Timothy First Timothy 1 Timothy and we're going to read from chapter 2 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 11 and Paul writes let the women learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not to I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing amen God bless you as you have your seats amen so two two different readings amen and and it has to do with the same subject one is after the fall God God was going to uh put the woman in subjection to the man and he was going to be her head for protection because we know that the woman was deceived in the transgression and so now uh the Apostle Paul's coming along and saying she's to be in subjection uh let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence and then he references Eden and so saying he references Back to Eden so that's the reason for that amen so this morning may be a little different I've got a PowerPoint I'm going to go over and and the way things transpired for me over the last couple of days is I had a subject that I was working on I've been working on and I was actually really excited about it I liked it and that's the way things go sometimes and I sat down and things were flowing um uh back I think it was Thursday or Friday and I was putting together some notes and and then I thought you know uh with this election coming up on Tuesday and all the craziness that's going on I just want to speak to the congregation and I said I'll just share a few things some perspectives and a few things um uh Sunday night at communion service and so that was good until I started looking at it and all of a sudden it started to explode amen things just started coming so I said you know I just want to take a look at some things some things the prophet said and I started looking at it and things just started opening up uh from for me and we know that we're in a crazy election cycle I don't even like talking about it I think everybody the word I think that the media is using is election fatigue I had it before it started amen CU it's just it's chaos it's embarrassing it's it's childish it's all of these other things but yet all of these events are significant and it's the world that we live in and this is the place where we're at so I want to look at it but not maybe in the traditional way so I've got quite a few quotes and I want to read quite a few quotes So I did the PowerPoint so we could read together so that we could stay together so that we could read what brother Benham said but what I really want to get to is what began to open up to me at the End Amen and that's really what it has to do with with you and I the position that we're in in this day so brother Frank if you could bring up that PowerPoint for me and I I titled this the rise of the woman because that's what we see is going on all around us and brother B pointed to it many many times uh he said women's on the page this is a women's world and when he starts talking about it uh uh he there there's very specific reasons why in this generation has begin to take off like that and hopefully we can get into it and uh begin to understand what he's seeing uh when uh when I I want to talk about uh this subject on the basis of the six Vision or the seven visions that brother Brenham had in 1933 and we know the sixth Vision he saw a woman rise to power in the United States so want to read what he said but I want to back up and catch the fifth vision and look at the fifth the sixth and the seventh and we're just going to review it quickly all right the fifth Vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centered mostly around women God showed me that women began to be out of their place with with graning of the vote then they cut off their hair which signified they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture I saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this Vision I saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world so before we get to the sixth Vision in the fifth Vision he saw the changing of society and the changing in Morality and the uprising of the women and getting out of their place so this is what precedes the sixth Vision so it's important to know what's been happening the whole Cultural Revolution and the sexual Revolution and and the liberation of women and the women's right movement all of it was working an agenda amen and and brother Benham was catching what it was and he was showing us that that it's not godly it's not according to scripture it's not according to the nature of Christ it's not right amen and and you say that and and we can say it thank God we can say it because we're here where we have the Liberty to say what God leads us to say according to the word we would say it anyways but we might find ourselves in trouble one day amen but it's the gospel truth and and it becomes something that's hard to say in the generation we live you go to work and you begin to say these things and you go out in public places because the whole mindset has shifted and the shifting of the mindset is all playing into the Playbook of the enemy amen but God's not being taken by surprise God has a plan also and so we know we've come to Satan's Eden and in Satan's Eden everything that he has planned is coming to the fullness to the full manifestation and here in the seventh age which is completion everything's coming to full manifestation everything's coming to the fullness of whatever seed it is it's coming to the full bearing fruit of that seed so whatever spiritual seed began a thing it's going to come and Blossom and bear fruit and declare what it is so that's where we live and when we come to the sixth Vision brother bam said then in the sixth Vision there arose up in America a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to a popular vote by women so that's the sixth vision and then the seventh Vision the last and seventh Vision was wherein I heard a most terrible explosion at as I turned to look I saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of America so in this in this series of seven Visions he had in 33 we just looked at Fifth Sixth and seven the uprising of the women getting out of their place the moral degradation of the world Amen then a woman rising into Power uh in the United States and then the destruction of the United States all right we're on the same page and one of these things just leads right into the other amen and so so uh I I want you to relax because I'm not going to draw a conclusion today I'm not going to tell you this is the conclusion what brother Brenham said because in reality I don't know so just relax we're not going to get off the rails and we're not going to force an opinion or an idea so many people have opinions or ideas or or ways in which they believe that this will transpire the problem is the prophet's not here to say this is that he just gave us the vision amen so I think for us in spiritual maturity spiritual maturity is not for us to to figure out what he saw and look at the Modern events and say this equals that I think maturity for us is to come and say that's nothing but the truth and what we see is certainly playing into exactly what he told us but I don't know how to say this is that and this is that we need a prophet on the scene to do that amen so that's not that's not what I'm attempting to do and I I can tell you this friends in the past I have been tempted and I have failed by taking modern event and trying to draw conclusions by what I saw and this political maneuver and this law was passed and these Stars aligned and all of this means that and God let me miserably fail in all my predictions and I thank God that he did I thank God I didn't share them all with you because a lot of them were just things I thought oh this is it this is that and then it was I was wrong and I'm thankful now that I was wrong because if I had been right it would have created a monster right I don't think God wants us to figure things out I think he wants us to believe follow his lead surrender submit Stay simple stay humble stick with the word amen so don't get nervous we're not drawing conclusions we're not we're not telling you what to believe if you believe one way know that's fine that's okay I have no idea I have no idea how everything's going to transpire or what everything's going to look like I don't know and I'm okay with that amen used to make me nervous if we're the bride we have the Holy Ghost we have the word we should know amen we may not know we may not know every detail but that's okay it doesn't bother me we still have the word and we still have the Holy Ghost and we still have the leadership of Christ amen so I want to there's there's a lot of things that I want to tie in and a lot of things I want to look at so just hold tight and stay with me and I'm going to look at a lot of things brother Brenham said and first I'm going to get into the realm of politics so brother Brenham had a lot to say about politics and I'm just going to pull a few things we could go on for days and days and days with all the quotes but I just want to take some highlights and and uh just show you what I'm seeing here so now the next thing we find out that the devil controls all politics that ever has been or ever will be right oh it's so much better just to get comfortable with that because once you know that your stress level just begins to diminish yeah that's right we find that in Matthew 4:11 and now we'll find out then that Satan already had politics but he's trying to get the church now this was in the the third seal now Matthew 48-11 is the scripture he's referring to says again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou Willl Fall Down and Worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold Angels Came and ministered to him so the devil showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them said unto him all these will I give thee brother Brenham looked at that and says he was in control of them all he could give them that's right so we showed by scripture that the devil Satan is in control of all the kingdoms of the world right so let's not let's not have any wrong ideas about even the kingdom or Nation we live in that's right amen amen uh he says in the world politics our world system is just as rotten as it can be I'm not a politician I'm a Christian but I ain't got no business talking about politics but I just want to say they're rotten on both sides I voted once that was for Christ I got to win that's who's got my vote amen I my vote is Christ amen so brother R got no business talking about politics and we don't either and resume of the ages is now remember it was Imperial it was Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of her Deathstroke when she joined to the nominal Christian Church of Rome and Incorporated paganism and Christianity and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroyed her but Rome is not going it alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute Authority by the World Council of churches so this is not just the Catholic Church alone that's moving in this movement but it's the Protestant Evangelical moves uh moving with them and they will have absolute Authority he says this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control this ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not Envision it that way this is because in Revelation 17 3-6 it states that the mystery Babylon is Seated on the Beast she is controlling the last or fourth Empire which is the Roman Empire this Roman Church is doing that with the World Church system system under her Rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world this is in resume of the ages out of the church age book I love reading quotes out of the church age book because the church age book is something brother brandom reviewed he edited he read it over multiple times he knows what's in there and it's there intentionally and on purpose and so he's telling us that there's going to come uh the the rulership of the world is going to come through the Roman system to the Catholic church and the Protestants uniting themselves together praise God Amen he says now now there is a voice today in the world of politics that's a great voice and people absolutely in this great day of politics it's all mixed up in their churches and everything and many times that we have just seen recently that the voice of politics is actually stronger than the voice of God in the churches amen right or the American people would have never did what they' just done he's here in January 1963 he's pointing back to the election of JFK which was the first Catholic President and that's what brother Brenham is showing Amen brother Brenham has nothing against John F Kennedy he has a something against that system that America was trying to get away from that's now moving in through the election of a president he's looking at what's behind the thing so so the voice of politics this is amazing is actually stronger than the voice of God in the church this is what's become the evident failure of the churches in America is their their their their need and desire to move to politics amen amen because it shows that that the voice of politics is stronger than the voice of God in the churches he said they they'd have never done it if the voice of God would have been kept alive in the church they'd have never made that mistakes but the voice of politics is so much stronger on the Earth today than the voice of God until people sold their Christian Birthright for a mess of popularity education and political power my goodness so the atmosphere that we see ourselves in it's all around us we can't get away from it we'd love to but we we see exactly what brother brenham's saying that the churches have become political and theyve become Pol itical because the the politics have more power than the voice of God and and there's there's a lot of things that I want to get into I just pray that God will help me and show the spirit behind all of these things because the church should have stayed with the word and the word only it should have looked to nothing else amen for help no other source no programs no denominations no hierarchy no theology amen no schools of learning they should have looked to nothing else but to Christ Jesus himself the word amen and and when they when they when they when they lost confidence in the word is the ultimate Authority headship and power amen they started to move to program they started to move to education and they started to move to politics and it shows that the church is always a woman it shows that the woman began to lose confidence in the male because the word is the male and she began to lose confidence in the male and she went out outside of headship and she begin to take matters into her own hands and when she took matters into her own hands that's when all these systems and forms and programs and politics and all of these movements began to take place and what it's actually showing is that there's a there's a church as a woman is out from under the headship of the word amen she's now trying to take control she she's actually taking control out of the Hands of Christ she's taking it into her own hands trying to accomplish what she didn't think the word was enough to accomplish she's trying to move things and accomplish something because she doesn't have confidence enough in the word to do it God help us to never come to this amen we've got there's going to be a bride at the end time that's going to stand on the word and the word alone one headship nothing else and she doesn't have to have any control she doesn't have to figure anything out she doesn't have to take it out of the hands of the word and do something herself help us God Amen so this is the problem with the church moving to politics amen the spirit behind it is the spirit of female dominance amen this is what happened in the Garden of Eden amen when the woman left the headship of the word and she left the headship of her husband and she amen all of a sudden found a way to accomplish what was desirable to accomplish what the word had said but she found a way on her own to accomplish it through wisdom and through reasoning and found a better way and she led the way into this way to fulfill the word right but we know it was a way of reasoning it was a way of logic and it brought death amen amen and because of that she was placed in subjection under the headship of her husband for protection because she was deceived she thought she was doing right but what she was trying to do was accomplish the prophecy she was trying to bring about the word but she was trying to do it through reasoning and logic and Science and all these other stuff she was trying on her own leaving the headship of the word leaving the headship of her husband to in her own way with her own wisdom that was presented to her to to to do it herself and that's what brought the fall and that's what brought death oh there's so much God has taught us friends this message has opened our eyes to the whole mystery we understand what went wrong at the beginning we understand what's going wrong now it's the same thing it's the same thing so now when you have churches moving into these political Realms and political activism and political moves and sponsoring political C dates and all this other stuff when you have that it shows that the woman is trying to accomplish what the word says in her own reasoning in her own logic it's the same thing that happened in Eden it's happening now she's taking the leadership amen she's not waiting on the word she she sees it's the word she sees it's it's right and now the churches are trying to regulate Morality In the Country amen not by the preaching of the word but by moving policy in government to force people to be a moral Christian Nation with no conversion with no word with no Christ am and it's never going to work it's not God's way amen amen oh praise be to God I thank God for eyes to see amen I thank God for Spiritual understanding so that we can see what's happening but oh God help us not to repeat amen help us to see ourselves help us to see our own uh uh uh our own humanity and our own wisdom and cast it all down and let's stay humbly beneath the word amen so this isn't just an expose of what churches are doing it's an expose of what's been wrong the whole time what Humanity has done with the word what the failure has been so that we don't repeat the failure because that's our human nature side has a tendency to go that way so we've got a we've got to have eyes that are open and we got to have a submissive humble uh surrendered spirit amen that's what the modern modern woman has lost and that's what's what's become so bad okay I'm going to keep going here I'm going to give a little back background in 1956 America rejected Christ brother benam tells us this he says if God willing I'm giving a try now of evangelism we know the Revival's over everyone knows that I predicted that back in 56 when it would start ending Billy Graham came back and Tommy Osborne and them and I said this is it America receive it or reject it this year and they rejected it we're nothing we nothing waiting but judgment now you mark that down and see if brother benham's right or not that's thus sayith the Lord we're heading for it and we're going to pay for what we've done so brother bam was telling us if you read many places he says in 1956 amen Billy Graham canceled overseas meetings brother Brenham canceled overseas meetings Tommy Osborne then and Oral Roberts and they crisscrossed the nation amen preaching all that year and brother Benham said in 1956 that that I believe this year either America will accept or reject the gospel then he comes in 1957 and said America's rejected Christ and that's what he's showing us here amen and and and it's it's very significant to where we are now because of this rejection in 1956 he says and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it at all she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation now he's once again referring to John John F Kennedy's election and she is rotten to the core her politics is rotten the morals of this nation is lower than anything I can think of and her religious system is rottener than the morals she become in doing this she has now joined herself all these churches and all of the nation into the Federation of churches has taken the mark of the beast what a thing why Christ give them the opportunity to come to my Feast the Feast of Pentecost which means 50 1956 was the 50th anniversary of the zusa Street Revival 50 years later was Jubilee brother Brandon went back to pisan and preached in Los Angeles the Jubilee meetings he preached the message Jubilee Amen on the 50-year Jubilee of the of the uh restoration of the gifts and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost and this is the 50-year Jubilee and in the 50 years God had brought all these evangelists back and brother brandham and they crisscrossed the nation preaching all over and brother brandham said this is it either they're going to come to the Jubilee or they're going to reject Jesus Christ and in the Jubilee year they rejected Christ it's a significant year it's not just 1956 it's the it's the Jubilee of the of the of the isua Street Revival yeah and brother brenham's looking at all these things and he's recognizing this is it and this is why everybody's criss-crossing the nation and now they're going to accept it and and in 1956 brother B said I believe that they'll accept it and we'll have a Revival that was him hoping that was his desire amen but he comes in 57 and says it's rejected so from that point on it's been downhill he said in birth pain she's totally rotten her politics and system is just as rotten as they can be there isn't a sound bone in her in her World Systems her politics her religious politics and whatever it is one says I'm Democrat I'm Republican I'm Methodist I'm Baptist why the whole thing is rotten to the core there's got to be something giveway she can't stand if you put a George Washington or Abraham Lincoln in every County in this United States it still couldn't come back it's beyond Redemption brother B says this in 1965 it's Beyond Redemption you he says now think about what he says put a George Washington or an Abraham Lincoln in every County it can't come back that means you cannot bring it back by politics because the George Washington Abraham Lincoln in every County I mean wow that would be a change that would probably bring a lot of changes but you can't bring it back by politics that's why the magum movement is Antichrist Christ I I I say that I mean I I may have offended people but I don't mean to offend you but the prophet of God says she'll never come back she'll never rise again says she's Beyond Redemption so how can we believe that we can make America great again when the prophet of God has condemned it and said it'll never come back so there's not a candidate there's not a party there's not a Grassroots effort that can ever bring it back if so then the prophet of God was wrong y That's why we as the bride we don't need to have anything to do with any Politics the devil has it all under his control we don't need to worry about it so listen I I I just want to tell you I'm your brother and I love you and and I'm not here to offend anybody I'm just here to tell you what I believe to be the absolute truth of this message and I don't mean to be offensive I don't mean to say things hard I just want to talk to you as a brother and I want talk to as a pastor and a shepherd of this local church and and say let's be led and G Guided by the word not by emotion not by politics not by our feelings and not even by our own desires because our own desires would want a better country our own desires would want morality our own desire listen friends uh when you look at when you look at uh when you look at two parties and you look at their platform and you look at what they stand for how can you not like policies on the right how can you not how can you disagree with a strong National border how can you dis agree with parental rights to make decisions about gender choices for their children how can you not agree with how can you not agree about religious liberty how can you not agree about economic plans it it there's so many things that in the natural sense we would agree with and see as right and good and in line with what is righteous but don't forget the deception is always what's close not what's far away so be very very careful that we don't attach our El to something amen that is claiming to be able to do something that God said's not possible God sent us a prophet for a reason he opened our eyes for a reason to keep us free to be a free people and to stay free so so praise God that's so I you know when this all started opening up and I went to prayer I said God I don't want to preach this and I I did I got got on my knees in my office I said God if I if I could preach something else please I don't want to preach this because people have opinions and they have passions and they feel strongly about things we all do listen I would love to see an America where my grandchildren could have more of what I had as a child and some of you who are a generation or two before me who wouldn't love that who wouldn't love more freedom more Liberty who wouldn't love more peace more Prosperity more of a chance to spread the gospel who wouldn't love that the problem is America condemned herself she rejected Christ the Judgment has been pronounced she can't turn back so I want to stay with the words and I want to stay with God's Prophet right amen he says America God Bless America it's a nation it's a Christian country it's a million miles from being a Christian country that was 1965 we're 60 years later almost she's a million miles from being a Christian country I don't even pray for it how can I pray for it and it won't repent under the mighty powers of God demonstrated before and denying the closing the doors to it and walking away I committed to God and she is going further away and now she is going to sink Just Watch What Happens amen am all I know is just to show you what he said said this is out of the church age book again then in the sixth Vision there arose up in America most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in America due to the popular vote by women so this is the church age book this is what's been edited proof read published then in 1965 and when brother bham got to the church age book he didn't draw a conclusion he said I believe that this was the rise of the Roman Catholic Church though I knew it could possibly a vision of some woman rising in great P America to the popular vote of women so if brother brandham didn't make it one or the other then I'm not going to either right God will God God will interpret prophecy by bringing it to pass we don't have to figure it out and and the reality is it may have already come to pass it may be coming to pass currently it may come to pass it may have come past in a fashion it may be a shown in a form it may have a greater fulfillment we don't know all we know is it's the truth amen amen God's in charge of the God's in charge of the Fulfillment not me amen so I want to I'm going to I'm going to take and and and and just quickly go through a lot of the things brother Brenham said about this six Vision because being in the message we've heard a lot of things and a lot of people have said a lot of things and I've got several quotes starting from 56 the first time that I found him mentioning it was in 55 and it's amazing that this brother bam starts to talk about this six vision amen at the same time uh at the same time America rejected the gospel it's almost like they begin running on Parallel tracks the rejection of the Gospel brought judgment judgment came because the rise of the woman the immorality the the the all the things that came with that amen will bring about the Judgment okay so we're just going to read through like I said we're going to read through a bunch of of what uh brother says and it's not all in chronological order so I'm not going to I'm not going to recite the year every time and in the title just you can see it up there but in 1956 he said I predict that women would keep demoralizing and the nation would keep falling and they'd keep hanging to mother or like mother like that till they become a woman till they become a woman become an idol and after a while that America would be ruled by a woman mark it and see if it's not right a woman will take the place of a president or something of great some high power in America now I I want you I just want to lay this in as we read through this remember brother Brenham saw this as a vision and brother brandom is trying to understand what he saw but it's apparent that the vision didn't have labels so I hope you understand that because through all of this he says a president or something or like a dictator or he says in one place like a great Queen he saw something he he's trying to interpret what he saw but what he saw didn't have labels are we okay with that so he himself is not drawing conclusions he said it could be this or this it could be this or that he just knows that it's it's a woman rising to power for sure in America and then after that America's annihilated okay so follow with me me he said women are taking over of course that's just the trend of the prophecy of the day that this nation is a woman's Nation it'll be run by a woman and remember in 1933 I saw that come in a vision a great powerful woman will take over the whole nation someday that's exactly right before the end time before total Annihilation amen says and I said remember in that day before the end time comes before the end time comes that a woman now you keep this wrote down there'll be a great powerful woman rise up either be president or dictator or some great powerful woman in the United States and shall sink under the influence of women now you remember that's thus sayeth the Lord so here again it's evident brother Brenham saw something in a vision but the vision didn't have a label so he can't say it's for sure a president he said it could be a dictator or something some great powerful he saw it that's why he saw it and he's not even sure if it's spiritual related to the church or if it's physical or if it's both if it's a president or a dictator or some great power he just saw it and it's the truth the reason I'm saying this friends the reason I'm showing you this is because if brother brandham never pinned it down and said it's this this and this it'd be foolish for us to do that be very foolish for us because he's a prophet operating with a prophetic gift and he's the one who saw the vision we didn't we didn't even see what he saw and we're trying to interpret what somebody else saw based off things he said but the things he said were inconclusive in many areas we would be foolish to draw our own period And I said it will come to pass before the end time comes that there will be a great woman stand up in the United States because the United States is marked woman her number is 13 she'll rise up either be president or I put in parenthesis perhaps the woman being beautiful and attractive will be the Catholic church but cruel at heart and she'll lead the nation to pollution he says now it said in there at that time there'd be a great woman standup in the United States and she was dressed and beautiful but she was cruel in heart and I got in parentheses on the vision even yellow paper says perhaps the Catholic church so even brother brandham when he saw the vision he wrote it down he put in parentheses himself parentheses perhaps the Catholic Church perhaps and the woman being permitted to vote would help elect the wrong person for this nation and that's what they done exactly now said that would be the beginning what's he talking about that's what they done he's talking about the election of John F Kennedy the first Catholic President and and brother Brenham said you know he goes to the vision he says perhaps the Catholic church and the women being permitted to vote would help elect the wrong person for this nation and that's what they done brother brandham attributes the uh election of John F kinnedy to the vote of the women and crooked voting he does but so it's it's it's corruption and the woman that put him in place and brother bham is looking at this listen brother brandham when he looks at this he's not looking at at at at individuals he's not looking at women as as U inferior no intelligence not you've got to get that out of your mind he's looking at a spiritual principle here this Catholic system came in when did it come in it come after they rejected the gospel in 1956 they rejected the Jubilee of Pentecost and now he said it's going to go downhill from here then just a few years later there's a campaign and in that campaign now women start to show up in Mass to vote amen and the vote of the women and also what what he sees is corruption all of a sudden put what into place it put it empowered the Catholic Church which is the great the the the the vile woman of all the world right and she came in amen she and brother bam listen it's not like the Catholic Church came in and all of a sudden amen they had a a seat in the White House brother brandham seeing it as representation when this president was elected it represented what's happening spiritually and he said now it came in because America turned their back on Christ lost their protection left the word went in the ruin the uprising of women amen begin to start take place this this Revolution was taking place in this area the women light right rights the women Liberation movement the women's rights movement starts increasing and increasing amen and and and they start voting and they vote in mass and it was the woman's vote right that did what brought in the Catholic President it's the woman the woman the woman the woman because the man is Christ the word and that's what was left was the man and when the man was left the woman Rose to power and started accomplishing things on her own it's amazing it's amazing when you know Eden you know the Revelation it becomes so plain becomes so plain spiritually why these things are wrong why they're dangerous why and and I'll say as I've said before it has nothing to do with a man being more intelligent than a woman because there's a lot of you women that absolutely could blow me away in Scrabble and trivia and Mathematics and I mean all kinds of things that's not the issue the issue is the spiritual picture of Christ in his bride that's really what God is trying to project and preserve and demonstrate and Satan is corrupting that whole picture that's the real issue behind it all and then he says and he now listen he's referring to the sixth vision and he says they've done that that's what they' done exactly that would be the beginning he saw it coming in right there he saw the coming in of the Fulfillment of the sixth Vision right there he goes there is an iron curtain there is a bamboo curtain there is a purple curtain brother don't you fear none of the rest of them but watch that purple curtain she is sitting right there on the throne today in this country you got that this is 1962 this is uh after this is in the presidency of John F Kennedy and he says he's right on the throne to day in this country remember just like Ahab did Jezebel behind him the Bible calls the Catholic Church Jezebel prostitute and Ahab wasn't no bad guy I don't say that Mr Kennedy isn't a nice guy see he's running the parallel friend yeah you can't miss it amen Ahab is not no bad guy Mr Kenny isn't a nice guy I don't know nothing about him he's a man that's all I know he's the president I believe he'll make a good president it's not him it's that system behind him wait till she gets wormed into the cabinet and everywhere she can then oh sorry and and everything she can then watch what happened look what it done in other nations said it come in right there he said that was the beginning and now she's sitting on the throne wait till it gets warmed into the cabinet and I hey hey that's already happened do you know how many high ranking positions are held by Catholic people amen it it's it's astronomical it's in the it's in the supr court it's in the legislative branch it's in the uh uh executive branch all three branches of government have been completely infiltrated by people who are Catholics nothing wrong with the people they may be intelligent they may be doing an excellent job in wherever their place but brother brandom is looking at a spiritual principle behind that amen it's their faith their faith in that Catholic system their attachment to it is showing where the nation is going where she's at and what she's allowed and what's coming in to take control that's what he's saying that's what he's showing us and if it and if it was happening in that day just open your eyes it is all over the place Souls that are in prison now he says them Prophets rebuked The Modern women of their days and they both paid for it by their life history proves that each one of these times was a woman's world when women controled now he's he's showing back uh Jezebel's day is one of the things that he's talking about when women control because Jezebel took control she took authority over Ahab her husband she was the force Power behind his headship so she actually took the head she actually says you lay here in your bed because I've got no confidence in your ability to accomplish this but I Jezebel will accomplish it for you spiritually let's take it to Christ and the church amen uh we've been preaching the same message we've been preaching it for years and years and years but the nation's turning and abortions coming in and there's immorality we've got to do something right why don't you listen to a prophet and preach the true word because the word has the power to change lives not policy not government not not these institutions but why not stick with the headship of the word and believe that the word can do it not treat the word like Jezebel treated Ahab you lay there you're going to stay to the side it's fine we'll call you the king yeah right yeah you can be the king amen but I know that you know you're a little bit weak and you're not able to accomplish this but I know how to get this done I'm going to go around through a political maneuver which is what Jezebel did she went to a political mover and and move in a corrupt system through through corrupt voting by boxes listen I'm not trying to be funny it's just it's just funny through lies and false testimony amen she comes through a political corrupt system amen and she uses the she uses the legal system of the day amen to have this man stoned to death and she comes back to AB and says Rise Up take nebo's V for I have delivered it into your hand God hated that so bad that Jezebel became the symbol of everything Wicked in Fe in a feminine race all the way through the rest of the Bible she's considered Wicked the poster child for a Wicked Woman God help us so let's keep reading souls are in prison now paragraph 200 look about today we've had one president one of the one of these days look like could happen right now actually she is president he's just a figurehead uh stop with me for a minute let's put on our spiritual jackets he's talking about JFK's wife jacqulyn Kennedy and he says she's actually the president now we're going to read what the rest he's saying she's not in the oval off office writing and signing her name and and writing out legislation and passing executive orders that's not what he's talking about but watch what he says actually she is president he's just a figurehead here not long ago in one of the other nations she was getting so much praise and everything from all the people till the president himself said I'm her husband the president of the United States see she sets the Fashions the women follow it see just like Jezebel did you heard my sermon on Jezebel religion you know you know about it you see where we're at listen brother Brenham never had anything against John F Kennedy and he had nothing against Jacqueline Kennedy in fact she was probably a fine woman and she probably was a good mother and it seems like so from testimonies and things we heard that she was a fine person brother it's not that's not what he's talking about he's looking at something take place on the on the worldwide stage and he's recognizing that this has everything to do with the uprising of the feminine spirit and it's wrong until she gets more attention than the president till she has more influence over fashion and over things than the president has and brother brand can look at it and say that's wrong listen brother BR was still a human being remember when remember when jonath Kennedy was assassinated brother brenon was in meetings and he had the whole congregation stand and pray for Jacqueline Kennedy and for her kids he said I disagreed with the man he said but nobody deserves to be shot down like that and leave that poor woman in those poor children listen brother Brenham had no beef against any people and neither do we right there's fine people everywhere tremendous people people that I would love to spend time with we're not talking about people in these movements people in these camps people who are doing it's not people it's spirits that are moving and influencing and trying to take control amen so brother REM says now actually she's president like what a statement he's just a figurehead but she wasn't signing policy she wasn't changing laws it wasn't that she became the influential figure for the women here's a picture of her brother B could see this picture and he could recognize we're in trouble this is not Dwight Eisenhower's wife the previous president she looked like a grandma he recognized they rejected Christ in 195 56 come in 57 preaching that the the judgment is coming then in 19 uh60 they elect a Catholic president he's a young man he's attractive with a young wife she's attractive and now she's setting the fashion for the ladies amen and and brother B says this country is in big trouble I thought this picture was very fitting because all eyes are on her amen she's like a queen nothing wrong with the woman but brother Brenham saw this and he typed it with Ahab and Jezebel he saw the moving of the Catholic church and he saw it being manifest in the rise of the women in America it's amazing friends I'm so thankful for a prophet who will just say what he sees amen he won't he won't sugarcoat it he won't even sometimes fully explain you just say it yeah and we can come back years later and read and says he was exactly right he was spot on he knew exactly what he was talking about if he could see that there and call it what it was there what about advancing at 60 years and we say oh my goodness he was he was more right maybe than he knew I don't know but he was more right than I knew right right he was right now he goes on and say but there will be a powerful woman now remember this is on tape to a powerful woman great woman she'll either be president or it'll be a woman representing the Catholic Church which I think it is I love I love this some people will go and say well brother R said I think it is so that's what it is but he never said that's what it is he said which I think it is right and listen don't get nervous I'm not pulling a conclusion I'm just telling you what he said we just want to see what he said really what I hope at the end of the day is you don't draw any conclusion you just move forward in the gospel and move forward with the word and let things transpire the way they're going to transpire he said uh it'll be a woman representing the Catholic Church which I think it is will take over here someday and she'll rule this country this nation is a woman's Nation flag was made by a woman it's number 13 she started out 13 stars 13 stripes 13 colonies everything's 13 13 13 right on down 13 stars on her silver dollar now everything's at 13 it's number 13 and appears in the 13th chapter of Revelations completely 13 everything is a woman woman woman woman right on down and she took over all the offices she took over Hollywood she's took over the Nations she's took over the offices she's took over everything there is equal rights with the man votes with the man cusses like a man drinks like a man anything else and just bait for the Catholic church for the worship of woman brother brandom could see what was behind it from that time he says I don't I won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's Nation it's the number 13 it appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes everything's a 13 everything is a woman and remember thus sayeth the Lord there'll be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her yeah he saw it in Vision I seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus sayith the Lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't I'm a false prophet so brother Brenham knew he knew there was a woman going to rise to power Amen brother bham still when he's making quotes all the way through he's still not solid whether it's the Catholic Church whether it's a woman rising in power it's a woman representing the Catholic Church there's so many ways that you could think about this and say well is is it is it this or is it that or is it this but he knew it was going to happen and listen in this quote he says she'll either be president vice president or to be the Catholic Church well we've already had a woman Vice President we now and look at this picture I that picture is amazing the capital building all the flags and here's a woman rising to great power second in command now I don't think she's the Fulfillment of the vision so don't don't get nervous but it is a fulfillment of the vision it may not be the culmination it may not be imperfect display it may not be in the fullness of what it will be but it's what the prophet told us that women are rising in power taking over all the offices and one day she'll be in great power that's true and don't get excited either I'm not predicting that Kamal is going to win the election I have no idea when everybody you listen to says it's a coin toss but I've learned I don't believe anything I hear anyways I have no idea I mean I it's beyond me and I'm I'm out of the prediction business I quit I turn turned in my whatever you have to turn in my certificate that I made myself I'm done I have no idea so don't get nervous I don't know what will happen tomorrow but I'll tell you this what happens on Tuesday not tomorrow Tuesday is inconsequential it'll either be the Fulfillment it'll be a further fulfillment it'll be representing the Fulfillment I don't know what it will be but nothing's going to stop this prophecy and the prophecy's already working brother benam said it began when the woman vote elected John FK and when they worm their way into the cabinet and the woman rising in power and taking over the office say Hey listen we're already in the sixth Vision we may not have come to the completion we may not know any more details or what it will look like exactly at the End Amen but listen hey it's already happening all around us folks and it's going to continue to happen what I don't want the church to do what I don't want to do myself is I don't want to come Tuesday and all of a sudden that we hear uh uh we hear that uh uh uh Trump was elected president and somebody say we got four more years wrong thinking friends that's the wrong thinking amen because we don't listen I I uh I don't know how to say all these things but they're in my heart but you just pull and I'll just speak and I'll try not to speak too fast because I'll say it wrong there's nothing in the seven visions that say that the bride has to be on earth and the Fulfillment of the seven Visions that's because the seventh vision is the annihilation of America by nuclear bombs and brother Brenham said they won't fall until the bride is gone so we won't be here for the Fulfillment of the seventh Vision who says that we'll be here for the Fulfillment of the sixth Vision if we even know what the Fulfillment of the sixth vision is true it could transpire at the beginning of the tribulation period after the church is caught away I don't know but we know for for sure it's on the Move we know for sure the spirit's moving we know for sure we're in the sixth vision and it will be fulfilled exactly the way God intended and exactly the way he showed the prophet amen and so if you think well we got four more years then then you don't understand what spirit's working in politics don't dare think that until we see a woman as President we can't go in in the change of the body don't don't think like that brother B didn't tell us that in fact that's not what we're looking for to have faith brother Brenham said that the faith that will come for rapturing Grace came in the sounding of the seven Thunders the opening of the seals that was what woke the bride up that's the bride's Revival that's what connected her back to her bridegroom Christ and that's what woke her up and stood her on her feet and that's what's lifting her off this Earth word by word am so don't think wrong thoughts yeah just let God manifest himself and let God bring it to pass so don't think we got four more years we may not have four more days praise God that gets me giddy when I think like that amen look at this quote said I saw a great woman standing up beautiful looking dressed in real Royal purples like like purple you see how she was inaugurated so many people say well that's the Fulfillment well I it it's a fulfillment yeah I don't know that I could say that's the Fulfillment but that's definitely in line with some things brother Venom said yeah for sure High Royals like purple and I got little priny saying she had a she was a great ruler in the United States perhaps the Catholic Church a woman some woman I don't know her to be the Catholic church I don't know I can't say only thing I seen I seen the woman that was all I love how honest the prophet is he himself is not saying it's this or it's that he said I think it's this but I don't know he even tells us uh uh uh not in this quote but in another one that he believes it to be the Catholic church but then he comes in this quote and says I don't know her to be the Catholic church I don't know I can't say only thing I know is this was what I saw and it's true yeah and it'll happen praise God and broken system he said then I said I seen a woman stand in the United States like a great queen or something and she was beautiful to look at but Wicked in her heart and she made the nation go at her step so brother Bron listen he says she's a president a v or a vice president or a dictator or some great power or like a queen cuz the vision didn't have labels yeah right he saw it he knew it to be true he tried to describe to us what he saw but we didn't see what he saw but it's taking place all around us it's happening day by day it's moving in the sixth Vision praise God souls are in prison he says but there she stands there she is that's her preach the word handle the word become a goddess and the cause of every sin Bible said I suffer not a woman to teach or to usurp any Authority but to be in obedience as also sayith the law and she can't do it but they make her ruler of the land mayor Governor soon she'll be president sure there you are that's the way that's the way it goes see you know let's just do some wh ifs I know that's dangerous you're probably thinking that's dangerous what if vice president Harris wins the election what changes for you and I what changes in our Revelation what changes in God's plan amen what if she doesn't win the election what changes for you and I is brother BR more right or less right what is she win the election and she serves a term and at the end of the term she loses the next election and a man comes in and what if he serves four years or eight years and then and then uh he comes out of office and then a second woman is president what if time goes on for 20 30 some more years and we wind up with a third woman President right what are we going to believe believe then the same thing we believe today probably more of it amen with more manifestation and more power in our Liv amen this isn't time to be children but it's time to be mature right let God what brother B didn't tell us is not for us to try to figure out what he did tell us was going to carry us through whatever happens next amen said in this is out of the church age book from the tharan church age the tharan church age was the the peak of the Catholic church and its political and and uh demonic power as it ruled the known world at that time before the Reformation he says from the Garden of Eden onward woman has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man and right today it is a woman's world and the goddess of America being a naked female as the female Idol F out of the sky remember her arms were iron bars characterized the first or Ephesian Church age that's Diana the Goddess Diana so her power has grown until she has gained absolute Authority such Authority being usurped by her iron disposition now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scriptures to be submissive to the male that is commanded of her woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real man makes a female a doormat but she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the male for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take authority has also broken the image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertaineth to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she's intruding into the male domain taking Authority and perverting herself and when a woman invades the pull pit which she's commanded she must not do she shows what Spirit she is of being a dominant female is Antichrist and the seeds of the Roman Catholic Church are in her though she may deny this ever so vehemently but when it comes to the word let God be true and every man's word a lie oh man I left out a quote but don't worry I have my notes there was something else brother Bram said in the thot Church age actually I may have read it I just may not have under LED it I don't think so all right yeah here it is he says it's most worthy of note oh I lost it yeah this is same thing out of the tharan church age it is most worthy of note that the very name thotti means dominating female thus this age is characterized by a dominant force a force that ruthlessly invades all conquers all and despotically controls now listen now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world Prophet says it in the church age book a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world why is it the greatest curse in the world because it's what caused the fall in the beginning when the woman left the headship of the word and she by reasoning began to dominate and began to lead the way to fulfill the word through reasoning and through her own effort she became dominant she was deceived in doing it then but she still did it and now a dominating female is I'll read it again a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world that's why when brother bham saw what was happening all around him he knew that this was wrong it was a Jezebel spirit was coming from the Catholic church and it was going to produce what it was going to produce so then he goes on to say being a dominating female is Antichrist because it's completely contrary to the scriptures that's what's so wrong with it it's not that that these women are Baden women it's not that people who don't know and are living in ignorance and they have no idea it's not that they're bad people that's not the issue the issue is that a dominating female is Antichrist it's off the word and when men begin to cater to that woman because uh uh for whatever reason there's a there's a myriad of reasons but a lot of time it's just the weakening of man it's an Ahab nature that comes in and and and I'm I'm not even going to take the time to get into that but anyways I want to but I'm not but what happens is now she Rises the power to accomplish what she perceives her male of not being able to accomplish and that's Antichrist because God is the father Christ is the Son and he's the bridegroom he's the husband he's the male his church is the female that's why that's why I say whatever happens on Tuesday is inconsequential because either we'll see a greater manifestation by by actually having the Fulfillment of a woman president showing that we're further down the road or we'll have this system on the right that is religious and churches Binding Together to support grassroot ever it's still the woman yeah amen right because the churches are trying to move policy the churches are trying to save America right because apparently the gospel can't because they got weak in the pull pits and they left the headship of the word and started injecting their own thinking there's no power in the pull pits to change lives now so what they've gone is they moved to politics ICS to try to move policy so that they can so they can still be effective and have a Christian Society it is a jezebel move it is Antichrist it is off the word it is completely wrong and it doesn't matter how nice it sounds we want to fight abortion abortion is wrong we want to fight I mean this gender uh neutrality that's wrong amen we want to stand up for the rights of Paris that control it that's that's right amen they're right in all of that they're wrong in the method they're doing it if you want do it do it by the word and by the preaching of the word that's the right way because that puts Christ back in headship and puts you back under submission and makes him the head him the leader him the king not a figurehead King we love Jesus and we love the word but we've got the of our own power and our own wisdom and of Our Own Strength find a way to accomplish the word because simple preaching and believing of the word is not enough anymore amen so listen we're here the dominating female is controlling amen remember the deception is not what's far away the deception is what seems good and is similar and people won't understand why you believing in these things won't join Force they might even ask you do you believe abortion is wrong yes I believe it's wrong do you believe it's right for parents to have control yes I believe that do you believe that that this and that and the other yeah I believe all of that then why aren't you with us right why won't you join forces why won't you help us if you're not for us you're against us the whole thing setting up for what brother B told us is going to happen the church is controlling politics and one day she'll show how great that control is it's all in the church age book they say what happens Tuesday is inconsequential to the sixth Vision the sixth vision is manifesting itself all around us amen the word is so good that's why the the the you say the religious right let's just say that amen they believe that they're doing God a service but it's without being God's will amen right it is Jezebel trying to overcome and Conquer for Ahab because Ahab can't and you know what they're blind to it they're blind to it but blindness has come because they're f fathers rejected the message and it happened in Israel over and over and over again destruction came because the fathers rejected the prophet's message now the children were brought up under that and they were blind and they went further off and destruction came right their fathers rejected the message and now the church systems are binding themselves together with the Catholics listen now it's amazing now you want talk about dropping denominational barriers they're dropping denominational walls so fast they don't care if you're Catholic Methodist pres they could care less let's all get together and fight this thing yeah right Jezebel Jezebel Jezebel and the spirit behind it brother B said a dominating female has the seeds of the Catholic church in her it's the Catholic it's the same Spirit that's in the Catholic church that's in the Protestants let's read that let's go to Revelation 17 Revelation 17 Revelation 17 1-9 before we read this don't read this yet I shouldn't had you turn there but just things keep coming we don't believe in male leadership in the church because males are better than women we believe in male leadership in the church because the word says so we don't believe that men should preach and women not preach because men are better preachers than women actually I heard a woman preach one time and she was good yeah it's the truth but it's because the word says so men don't take dominion and Authority in their home because they're better smarter wiser stronger than their wives that's not why they do it because the word says so we can go through all kinds of attributes and start showing how the male is bigger and he's this and he's got this nature she's nature all of that's true but at the end of the day it doesn't matter what excuse you come up with or what reasonings we don't need any reasonings the word say says so the word says a man is leader in his home the word says the preaching of the Gospel is done by men the word says amen the officers in the church should be men the word says and the word is our headship the word is Christ amen and if we don't want to be Jezebel we better stay under the word amen do you know that John Wesley was one who started promoting women preachers here's the reason he said if we equip more people to go out amen we'll get more work done and we'll get more Soul saved what was that human reasoning the same thing that caused the Fall In the Garden of Eden but the word said she couldn't yeah why do we do what we do cuz the word says so it doesn't make sense it doesn't have to make sense I don't have to prove that you know I'm stronger than my wife and I have more endurance so I'll go to work and she'll stay home listen my wife has way more endurance than I have especially when we raising little babies I could not do sleepless nights and work all day and take care of them and nap and listen she had way more endurance than me so let's stop looking at these gender things and reasonings and scientific we don't need any explanation all we need is the word the word is why because Christ said so and that's enough for the bride we don't need anything else that's what frustrates me so bad with trying to apply apologetics to the message and trying to reason and understand and debate with the denominations all we need is to know that this is thus sayeth the Lord that a prophet was Vindicated he brought us the true interpretation of the word I don't need apologetics I don't need reasonings I don't need to prove it to anybody God's not asking me to do that he's asking me to Simply believe him and let him be the headship let the revealed word of the hour be the headship quit trying because brother brandham didn't say it well enough and he didn't just let the headship decide who he wanted to use and how he wanted to say it praise God Revelation 17 go to verse one Revelation 17:1 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither and I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was AR raay in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a gold golden cup in her hand full of the Abominations of the filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the Abominations of the earth she's a woman and she's a mother and their children of the Protestant churches and they're harlots it's the same thing they become the same thing their mother is and I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs and of Jesus the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration when John saw this it was beautiful it was spectacular it wasn't hideous and ugly and Despicable and it was beautiful it was admirable it was probably tremendous so we have to be careful when it looks good sometimes and the angel said unto me where therefore D thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and the Beast that carried her which had the seven heads and the 10 horns the Beast that thou saw us was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sth so we know that this is Rome and we know the Rome we know that Rome was the fourth Empire of the great Gentile world domination and that that that uh system of Rome actually never morphed into a new system it just became the paple system but it was based on the same system and running on the same power of the system of Rome and now it's infiltrated the whole world Amen even the United States of America So This Woman This scripture says here the last the verse 18 and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reth over the kings of the earth who Reigns over the kings of the earth who's controlling politics it's the woman she has the gold of the world she's behind the scenes pulling strings she's moving that's why we're seeing women rise into Power it's a manifestation of what's going on spiritually she's controlling the world and one day it's going to become obvious but that's not God's way do you know who this is this is Satan's bride not God's bride Satan's bride is getting involved in politics Satan's bride has left the headship of the word of Christ and trying by her own way and her own mechanisms to force and have dominion and force what she believes to be true yeah to control people through law and legislation it's the same thing the Catholic Church did yeah amen I hope you can see it right this religious sweeping on the right uh uh in America it seems so good it's following the footsteps of the Catholic church because when the when the Catholic Church came into power under Constantine and generations after they begin to use the power of the state to enforce their own rules yeah right and that's the same thing the religious right in America is trying to do they're trying to use the power of the state to enforce their rules what they believe is moral what they believe is right what they believe is the word it's the same thing it's the same spirit it's the Catholic Spirit the Catholic Church spirit it's the spirit of Jezebel it's the great and the harlots moving with the same exact agend doing it the same way but that's not how the bride works this is actually what I want to end with when we see a woman's World brother say women on the Rampage woman everywhere It's A Woman's World woman's become the idol and he makes all of these big statements and if you just listen if you just take a statement brother Brenham said and and and you can be somewhat offended because no don't be offended just try to see what he's seeing amen women on the Rampage women's right now she can vote and brother REM said that was a horrible thing when women was given the right to vote and if somebody questions you and Corners you on that and tries to get you to explain why it was and you move to reasoning you're going to be like well because the Simplicity of it is is she's supposed to be under headship and her husband's the one who should be voting he decides for the home she doesn't need to decide because she has a husband who decides when women were getting the right to vote they were given the power to choose differently than their husbands and that was the empowering of the women into independence from male leadership and that's what voted in JFK and brought in the Catholic Church you say they shouldn't vote they don't understand the issues they don't read that's not going to work today why was it a horrible thing they vote because it was empowering them to operate independent of the headship God put them under and that's Antichrist it's amazing friends it's amazing God has a different way for us we're going to look at a few scriptures Now 1 Peter 3:1 likewise you wise being subjected ction to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plating the hair wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God Adorn War themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and not afraid with any amazement when Peter picks this up he calls this good that Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord listen we we we all know of people or heard of people I don't actually know of anybody but heard of people that would try to take a scripture like this and abuse it in some way for a man in some way to take ungodly dominance but that's wrong that's also not Christ but it's still the truth yeah because the women should be Sarah's daughters that means coming after Sarah and the example of Sarah who obeyed Abraham calling him Lord God loves submission and obedience he loves it God loves the feminine attribute God loves it God is expressed in masculine and God has expressed himself in feminine and God loves both yeah and when God separated the feminine out of Adam in the beginning God intended for those two to stay separate and operate separately and he didn't want them to change their own Natures he wanted them to stay the way they are and that's Godly that's what he wants amen that's what he wants today Satan is a great perverter of the word in Titus 2 it says the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becoming Holiness not false accusers not given them much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed so we hear many times that the aged women should teach the younger women but but Paul's very specific in what they should be teaching them yeah right that's why I don't believe in women L Bible studies she's not supposed to break the word she's not supposed to teach the word but he said the aged women should teach the younger woman what should they teach the younger women they should teach them how to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be be discreet chaste keepers at home obedient to their own husbands not what happened in the Garden of Eden not godhead not what you understand teach them how to be feminine how to be a woman according to the scriptures that's what they're to teach them 1 Corinthians 11:3 but says but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesy with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the woman is not of the for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of angels this is why a woman doesn't cut her hair the same thing I remember in the past when he talked to me we try to reason this out there's no reasoning because she's under headship and God wants her to have a sign of power on her head that she's under headship which is uncut hair yeah it's a covenant it's a covenant with her husband and a covenant with her father that she's under another headship and that's the headship of her husband you remember when Samson Samson was under a covenant is that right he was under a Nazarite vow and a Nazarite vow is a vow of Separation unto God and one of the signs of that Nazarite vow was he had uncut hair and his uncut hair represented his consecration to God yeah a woman's uncut hair represents her consecration to her headship her husband all right when they wanted to find Samson's power they started saying Delila the the false Church started playing around with this power what where is your power does it where does it lie and he says if you uh bind me with ropes and he broke the ropes and bind me with green WID broke the green wids if you weave my hair he broke those but in the fourth he says if you cut my hair no Razor's ever been put to my head amen and when his hair was cut listen how significant it is when his hair was cut it showed that he had broke his vow of consecration to God God was no longer his headship and when his hair was cut his power was gone right this is why the churches have no power because they've cut off their hair and I don't mean you go into a church and physically see women with short hair I mean they have cut off their consecration to God they haven't stayed consecrated to this word yeah and they have cut off their hair and they have no power if we want Power if we want real power how do we have power let's let the Seven Locks grow back out right amen Samson now in the church AG is grinding away at the Mill his eyes have been pled out plucked out he has no vision he's weak he's grinding away and grinding away but something happens those Seven Locks come back the word starts to be restored he comes back under a vow of consecration which was what he was born for and when his hair grows back amen he prays the parents says once more and then the power comes back oh I want to have that kind of power the power wasn't in Samson the power was in The Vow the consecration the dedication to God Amen where is our power our power is not in ourselves not in our minds not in our wisdom not in our intellect it's not in anything we have our power is in our consecration to God staying under the headship of Christ the manifested word in this hour the restored word is our bridegroom the revealed word and when we come back back to a consecration under the Seven Seals to this word the power comes back what power the power to defeat the enemy of the church and the enemy of the church is compromised amen the enemy of the church is this great uh and Harlot system that's trying to get us to move by reasoning intellect by our own power to do something ourselves oh the word has come back the bridegroom is here here how will the bride manifest herself not when she figures out what she can do she'll manifest herself by coming back under that headship the tharan church age says and this th tyan Church age she is a dominating female she's mystery Babylon she's the great she is Jezebel the false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to God who wants to be the true female amen Christ is her head she has no word but his no thought but his no leadership but his that's the true female that's the bride Jehovah Gyra he says a woman it's her nature of a woman to surrender to a man and it's the nature of the church to surrender to Christ surrender to his will Just Surrender she has no thinking of her own she takes his word were not somebody else's if Eve would have done that we'd have never had to die but she listened to reasonings but the real bride of Christ takes the headship of Christ the word and only believes God's word that's the real the restored bride you know what we see on display today this is we've come to Satan zeden we've come to the end of the seventh Church age we've come to the Pinnacle the completion the fullness and what you see is two women the rise of two women one is a false Church system amen you're going to just say Catholic church now it's the Harlot and her daughters yeah and this false system is Rising by grabbing Power by exercising Authority by manipulation by by reasonings by education by debate by all these things she's grabbing power she's doing what Jezebel did grabbing power trying to trying to find a position try to your position try to bring dominance try to bring rule that's the other one that's that's Satan's bride but what is Christ bride doing seeing how little she can become cu the Way Up Is Down not to figure out not to have any method of her own or any plan of her own or Nothing what how is she coming into this position how is power coming back by saying well that's what the word says right why do you do this and that that's what the word says why don't you do this that's what the word says what what don't you have any of your own thoughts no this is what he said his thoughts are my thoughts don't you have your own will no I've surrendered my will his will is my will amen that's the true bride that's the feminine Spirit true woman and she wants to be under the headship of a man and this man is Christ Jesus the word praise God says therefore it's the word or nothing that's right he the word how do you know it's right he the word is Vindicated see he the word properly Vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word the headship he properly identif identificate identified Vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing forth himself in Vindication is the direct proof to the entire body you don't need Creeds then denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identification see identifying himself proves the headship to the body then we are united under one Vindicated headship that is Christ the word of God then our headship is a kingdom and the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom you are not a de denomination we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in the day when the word in God was one and the word and God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning In the Garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of God his body oh my what's the manifestation today A submissive woman what's he trying to show the bride of Christ Jesus Christ in Bride form Jesus Christ in his church Jesus Christ in the bride manifesting what a submissive woman am not like the Jezebel yeah the submissive woman doesn't have to give in answer the submissive woman doesn't have to understand the submissive woman doesn't have to protect herself the submissive woman doesn't have to come up with contingency plans that's her husband's job that's his responsibility he's my husband I don't have to figure out I don't have to solve the equation I don't have to defend myself I don't have to protect myself all that he's asked me to do is stay under his headship he'll take care of every everything else what if the World falls apart what if the government collaps what if all of this so what so what if the World falls apart so what if the economy collapses so what if the government's in shambles so what if America's Fallen bankrupt and destitute so what what does that change for the bride she still has a husband who's promised to provide for all his needs he still has the power of the spoken word he can put in your lips and create squirrels if you need squirrels you can still walk on water at his bidding amen you can still change the storm when he commands you to change it not what you do brother brandom said now remember that was given by permission that wasn't me doing that that was him telling me to do that don't you worry one bit amen Christ is in his bride and whatever she has need of he can supply by telling you now it's time to speak not what you do not what you say not your will not your desire not your manipulation none of that it's a complete surrender when brother Brandon manifests the the power of the spoken word amen he manifest it by total submission the most powerful thing that we have seen on the earth is a man with the power of the spoken word to create something from nothing amen amen not by repeating what God says but by God saying what you say by per Mission now the power of the spoken word the power that God alone has and Satan doesn't have that power he put back into a fallen human being yeah who's been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ who's been claimed under the adoption hour and he's put that word back in him and now when God says he could speak show me something more powerful than that and how did he do it by complete 100% humility and surrender he was in a storm he was heading down to Camp because you'll die in that kind of Blizzard can't survive it but a voice says go back where you were he stops for a minute says was that me doesn't sound reasonable go back he stopped and he ate a soggy sandwich and the voice said go back back and he turned around and he went back to where he was listen that was not reasoning that was not understanding yeah that was not self-preservation that was not self- protection right that was death yeah amen snowflakes were falling the wind was howling if he didn't go now he would never find his way off of that Ridge but he obeyed when he obeyed God come to him and God gave him permission to speak to the storm our power is not in what we figured out our power is not even seeing what brother Brenham did in trying to copy it of our own will our own desire not work up of emotion and trying to be real bold and get ourselves to have some kind of human super faith the power of the Bride is his power through the bride not her power amen the overcoming of the Bride is not her overcoming it's the Overcomer overcoming in her yeah and through her so how does she stay in this position by being gentle quiet submissive and surrendered she doesn't have to prove anything her husband's already proved it all and the Vindication of the word and the message it's been proved you don't have to prove it you don't have to defend yourself protect yourself provide for yourself he's promised to do that for us so what is it we do we do an opposite of the Jezebel systems in the the hour it's become a woman's World woman domination woman on the Rampage woman this woman that we come the opposite yeah yes women show flesh we show less am they use sexuality we stay humble they exert power they create dominance they Guilt Trip men into more power and more dominance we don't do anything but stay under the word that's the secret to power am he says he is the head his church is the body oh God it's the head that guides the body let the headship of the word guide the body of Christ and may I be part of that body am this is a just a small excerpt out of a message of pick up your pen and write when the angel told him to pick up his pen and it's a message from the angel of the Lord to us to you and I those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time where's the power it's coming through the bride is it her power no is it her wisdom no is it her word no it's his amen she's she's going to be an invincible Army because she knows who she is and she stays under the headship of the word in this day when women are on the Rampage praise God the bride's coming into a greater submission when it's becoming a woman's world the bride is wanting to elevate the man the word she doesn't want to dominate she doesn't want to hire position she doesn't want to control it she doesn't want to fix it she just wants to come under it Luke 14:11 for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbled himself shall be exalted this false Church system is about ready to be abased why because it exalted itself but the Bride of Jesus Christ who abased herself and comes subject submissive to the word she's just about to be exalted he said I want you to know this this is sure and you that's listening to the tape you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determine to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and for tells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on I think the bride of Christ is going to have the same testimony after the Rapture it wasn't me who got out of that predicament it wasn't my wisdom it wasn't my understanding it wasn't my strength I didn't hold on it wasn't my grit it wasn't my willpower it wasn't my determin it wasn't me I was just there when he did it it was all him he must now fulfill in and through the bride that which he he fulfill his power his works that he left for this time he doesn't need us to do he needs us to surrender he doesn't need us to to come up with a plan to work what the message isn't able to do doesn't need us to have wisdom to solve problems that the message can't solve that the word isn't have power so we have to come up with another program we don't need that friends that'll bring death what we need is to stay under the headship of Christ the revealed word our bridegroom and everything will work out just fine there's two women Rising one's Rising by force by dominance she's going to be a based but there's another one who's just waiting on her Lord and she's going to be exalted but not by her own efforts not by her own doings not by anything she did but brother Brenham tells her he says but their Folly will be made manifest when Jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and said this is her and the way he goes with her that's right and their Folly would be made known I don't know what that will look like in physical manifestation but I know it'll be him doing it he will lift her up she won't lift herself up he says in Revelation 3 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcome and him sat down with my father in his throne that false system thinks she's the queen of heaven but she's going to be cast down but there's a humble missive woman on the earth called The Bride of Jesus Christ who's going to stay surrendered to the word and she may look weak she may look defeated she may look like Samson little wimpy Samson grinding at the Mill led to the pillars by a child but she's under a vow of consecration she's under a Nazarite vow to Christ and God can accomplish through a submissive vessel that which he left for this day to finish what will it be I don't know but brother B said don't look for big things just surrender to God and let God do what God wants to do am oh I'm I'm going to finish right here I think this is my last one or two quotes I'm going to skip this one 1 Peter 5 5-7 likewise you younger yourselves into the other y all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that may he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you that's good instruction for the bride of Christ in the end time just humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and he will exalt you in good times he's promised to he's got a seat in his throne waiting for his bride she's going to rule and reign with him he's got a position that's already secure we don't have to try to secure it we don't have to prove it we don't have to fix we don't have to do we have to surrender yield that's why when I started looking at this for this little discussion I wanted to have tonight it just popped and blew and blew and blew I see two women the Bride of Satan and the bride of Christ and they can't be any more different than night is from day and I want to be completely different God help us to be completely different right I'm not depending on politics I'm not depending on a government I'm not depending on finances I'm not depending on Bank notes I'm not depending on insurances I'm not depending on Military I'm depending on his word the person of the word which is my bridegroom Jesus Christ my confidence is in him and if everything falls apart everything is right on time I don't need to fix it through Manu political Maneuvers I just need to rest and let him my Lord my headship my husband my bridegroom my lover take care of me now can you see why whatever happens Tuesday is inconsequential the woman's running the show and she's going to run it to Falls to a complete collapse and an Annihilation says brother brandom America is going to be destroyed but thank God I won't be here for the destruction not because I'm smart not because I have determination not because I have willpower but because I have faith that he's called me to a different calling and I want to surrender the Way Up Is Down surrender submission humility will win the day yes amen let's all stand musicians if you can please come let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for this day that you've given us God when we see the world and its we're so thankful that you had a voice on this Earth that can declare it to us and that you've given us eyes to see and ears to hear and Lord I just pray that you would continue to give us the isab of your word to remove the scales so that we can clearly see what we're facing God I pray that you would help us Lord to be that woman that you're longing for well the first woman failed Every Other Woman failed every church has failed but you youve predestinated one not to fail Lord I want to be part of that woman that's not going to fail but she's going to stay surrendered to you help us Lord God I pray that you'd help us to drive out all Pride God PRI drive out all fear let your perfect love come and root out all fear so that we're not motivated by fear or fear of man or fear of what man can do and we're not motivated by pride of who we are and what we look like but we're only motivated by one thing and that's love that we could surrender and love you and see you as you are and receive your perfect love for us and reflect back a perfect love to you God that we can surrender and just hold fast and steady knowing that all things are working together for good Lord we see the world falling apart and we can't do anything to fix it it's falling apart because your judgments are Unleashed upon it Lord because they've rejected your your grace your mercy and a message of the hour with strong and powerful Vindication it's been turned aside and discredited God we see what's happening God we as human beings Lord Jesus are subject to the way that the world goes in many things and prices and and inflation and jobs and all of these things they affect us too Lord God I pray that you'd help us to look beyond the natural and see the spiritual help us not to be carnal or childish but help us to be mature to have faith and to realize the one who broke five fishes and two loaves and fed 5,000 is still here the one who spoke to the storm and the boat is still here Lord the one that could commission a prophet to speak to squirrel is still here you're still here you're dwelling in your bride and you're here to accomplish what you've left for this hour through us God help us to stay out of the way and let you have preeminence for your great desire in this hour the second fold of your great purpose that you want to accomplish is to have preeminence in a group of people on the Earth and Lord You're accomplishing that now I say God accomplish it in me I love you Lord thank you Father help us Lord to move forward with Clear Vision of who we are with a clear understanding of what you're accomplishing this hour help us not get caught up in rhetoric and news and all of the voices but let us listen to One voice and one voice only let us have an ear for your voice and may that voice be our guide bless your people Lord bless us today as we go and fellowship and get a bite to eat and come back for communion bless us and help us encourage us and strengthen us and bring us back safely to your supper we love you Lord and we ask your blessing in Jesus Jesus Christ's name amen amen well Lord willing be back here 4:00 for communion and feet washing just want to say God bless you and after this don't ask me what you what I think's going to happen on Tuesday because I'm probably wrong I don't know what's going to happen but to me it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's already happening the cogs are moving the wheels are rolling everything's happening right on time amen but there's a word that
