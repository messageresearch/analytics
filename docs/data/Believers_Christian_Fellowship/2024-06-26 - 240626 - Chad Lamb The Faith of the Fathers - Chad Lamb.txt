for God we're we know and understand your way for you've chosen to use man but we also understand the fallacy of man and the fragility of man we're asking God for your Supernatural anointing your spirit to move and take a vessel of clay and use it according to your purpose and your design to speak your word to the hearts of your children may that word Lord come into us may it take root deep within us and may it grow and bear fruit for your kingdom we love you and we yield ourselves to this task in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen man God bless you all it's good to be here tonight while you're standing if you want to take your Bibles and turn to the Book of Malachi we'll read our opening scripture from there I just want to say uh many of you will know that we had originally planned for brother n Johnson to be here we' even uh had a note of it on the overhead but uh our schedule as a family was just too busy with the funerals and all the things that were going on so I called him a little over a week ago and asked if we could just postpone and he understood and that was okay and so we're hoping that we'll still see brother null sometime soon but it just didn't work out this time and so uh uh he'll be at the byc this coming week so if anybody's down there you'll get to see him and bump into do him and make sure you pass on greetings for us if you see him there also I wanted to remind you that the kids service will be this Sunday this coming Sunday back here uh in the afternoon in the sanctuary so we're looking forward to that uh and we'll have a good time together and also wanted to remind you that brother Gabe is traveling to Oregon this weekend you leaving Friday right brother Gabe leaving Friday so I'm sure he'll appreciate our prayers and may we remember to pray for him that God will use him mightily and bless his travel there and back amen let's look at Malachi 4 5 and 6 it says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse amen God bless you as you're seated may the Lord bless us as we look at his word amen God bless you brother Paul and sister noran it's good to have you back so soon amen good to have you in the service so God bless you and I think brother Ben and brother Aon L's mom is here God bless you it's good to have you back as well so they exchanged a sister for a mother so praise God um as we look at this scripture we know we're very very familiar with this scripture the prophecy out of Malachi which is a which is fundamental to our faith which is something we're all very much attached to but I wanted to look at it again because it's just on my heart and for a subject I want to take the faith of the fathers and I just wanted to look into it and I've been so consumed and so full with the things that I've been looking at and studying over the last few Services especially the the from last Sunday and I just sometimes I get rolling so fast I get so excited I I I get really enthusiastic sometimes and there's a lot of information a lot of quotes a lot of details and and I don't I don't intend to go so fast sometimes I don't intend to go so long and I don't intend to try to pack everything in the world into one sermon but sometimes I just want to slow down and go back and and look at little bites of this again and that's what I hope to do tonight but I can't promise you I won't get super excited and go super fast and fill the whole time with I can't make any promises amen I just get excited and and brother B said you can't be anything that you're not amen but my desire is to slow down just a little bit and talk about these things and I want to talk about the faith of the fathers because we've heard this brother B talks about this that we live in the day that the prophecy of Malachi 4 in the Scripture it says to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers is to turn turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers and brother bam said there was a dual coming of this uh Ministry of Elijah first in John the Baptist as he would turn the heart uh of the Old Testament fathers to the children to the New and Living Way to the to the uh to the dispensation of Grace that was coming upon the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and so that was his part of the prophecy but then there's a comma and then 2,000 years we have a uh the spirit of Elijah once again coming into a man William brandham to bring the hearts of the of the children back to the fathers amen those same children Amen in the first part of the prophecy became the fathers of Faith the Father the Pentecostal fathers and now 2000 years later we are the children of those Pentecostal fathers who used to be the children amen now we're the children and our hearts are being turned back to the faith of the fathers brother man mentions this numerous times I don't even know how many times but if if you're familiar with the message which you all are you you've heard him say it again and again and again but I found that so many times I hear something so often it becomes just a phrase and I take for granted that I understand what it means and maybe I do understand what it means but sometimes I haven't stopped to meditate on the impact or the depth of what that actually means the faith of the fathers so I just been asking myself what is the faith of the fathers it's a good question I mean I've been asking myself it this way is it a collection of doctrines that was lost over time and now been restored I don't believe that's it in itself that's part of it I do believe that because we do know that the true teaching of the apostolic followers was lost through the church ages and we know that it's been restored as brother brandham came to tie up all the Loose Ends Amen to take all those doctrines that were lost amen down through the church ages and the Dark Ages and and restore them back to us but I believe the faith of the fathers is more than just that and uh that's what I want to look at although I'm not rejecting that at all let's go to Acts chapter 2 when we look at the the faith of the fathers let's go to the day of Pentecost and begin there in Acts chapter 2 I'm going to begin reading from uh verse one and before I do that I've got a definition I just want to give you when we were back in Malachi 4 and6 when he says he'll turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers that word heart you know brother brandham he only quotes this verbatim a few times most always he'll use the word faith in place of heart are we familiar with that it would return the faith of the children or the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and and this word heart in the old test Testament means the inner man so if you pulled up the concordance and go in it means the Inner Man the mind the heart the understanding and so I think faith is an appropriate translation he's not brother R's not far off the mark what was he doing turning the he's turning the uh Inner Man understanding and mind of the children back to the understanding mind and and Faith which was the faith of the fathers their faith brought them an understanding in the Inner Man and so I believe brother M's right on par like he always is with the words that he uses amen so in Acts chapter 2 now that we're looking at the faith of the fathers Acts chapter 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was full come they were all with one Accord in one place so I'm going to stop just for a minute and and make sure we stay in the same frame of mind many times when we talk about Pentecost uh uh because we live in the day that's just just seen the Pentecostal Revival there's been a Pentecostal what was labeled a Pentecostal Revival from 1906 and brother bandam says it was actually the restoration of the gifts and there under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so many times when we talk about Pentecost sometimes we can get the 1906 Revival in our mind and even that Revival who moved in and overlapped in brother branham's time and he was part of that and he went to the Pentecostal people people but when he's talking about restoring us back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers it has nothing to do with the 1906 Revival he's talking about right here in Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost the day of Pentecost was the it was a a feast day amen for the Jews Pentecost means 50 and there was 50 days after Passover the Passover is when when Jesus was slain at Calvary Passover was one of the feasts of the Lord that was instituted by Moses and that Feast of Passover uh was first uh uh was first uh fulfilled or first uh practiced or celebrated at The Exodus when they were coming out of Egypt and from then in it was kept perpetually every year but then 50 days after the Passover amen you would come to the Feast of Pentecost amen and and that what's called Pentecost here in the New Testament and that's where we are in time Jesus has come he's fulfilled uh uh the prophet see he's he is the Passover Lamb he's come and showed himself to them for approximately 40 days or more 10 days before the Feast of Pentecost we know he ascends on high with all the resurrected Saints and now they're waiting in the upper room amen for the promise of the father to be bestowed upon them and that promise had an appointed time to come and that promise was going to come on the day of Pentecost they didn't know that they were just told to wait so so so on the day of Pentecost we know that the the spirit of God was going to come like a right Mighty rushing wind and the and the pillar of fire was going to break apart and little licks of fire going to be seen over them and there was going to be manifestations but I just when we come back to the day of Pentecost I want to come back and really think about the day of Pentecost because what they received was a an infilling of the Holy Ghost the very spirit and life that was in Jesus Christ was now coming back to indwell his church amen and there they were told to go and wait to T and wait for this promise to come upon them now they didn't know exactly what the promise was going to look like they didn't know exactly what day was going to fall but God knew exactly God was not waiting he knew exactly when this would come but they were told to go and wait and and the one thing that I I want to just point out is there is no amount of fasting and crying and beating on the altar that could make this happen any sooner this was a Sovereign Act of God that God was going to do his appointed way in his appointed time this was something God promised that he was going to give them and he promised he was going to do for them he told them to wait for it right and so it's important because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a promise for us if we if we have repented and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we have the same promise they had but what we must do is wait for it amen wait for God to do the Sovereign thing that we can't do and and we can't listen we can't Strongarm God we have to wait on God to fulfill his promise and believe that it's a promise we're not hoping if we've taken him at his word and we've got faith in our hearts to repent and be baptized in His Name by faith in his word then that same word that we that we had faith in to receive baptism in his name amen to repent from our ways and turn towards him that same faith in that part of the word will produce the rest of the word just having faith in him that he will keep his promise and we will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so this is where they are on the day of Pentecost they're there when Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under Heaven I want you to I want you just to take note uh this is going to become our audience and our audience were Jews devout men uh uh from every nation so they had gathered in for the Feast of Pentecost so they had gathered from all the nations where they were dispersed and they had come from many different places for the Feast of Pentecost amen so God knew when to wait for this sign when he had gathered the Jews from All Nations and they come for the feast God knew exactly when and he exactly knew what sign would get their attention cuz he knew the audience and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed marveling saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born uh parthians and mes and elamites and the Dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and caposh and pontis and Asia FR and pamilia and in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about sirene and and strangers of Rome Jews and prelit creit and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meanthis others mock saying these men are full of new wine amen so so this is the audience these are these are Jews Dev about men that have gathered for the Feast of Pentecost from All Nations and now they're here and God now is going to going to give a sign to these Jews and and he's also going to fulfill the promise that he left so if you can turn with me to John 14 let's turn to John 14 and look at this promise the Gospel of John 14 verse1 15 he says in verse 15 if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so now who is the comforter amen amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you so now he he gives them a promise that as he goes away he's going to pray the father to send a comforter who's going to be the spirit of Truth and then he says I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you amen so now we know who the spirit of Truth is and who the great comforter is but then he goes further and and he says that that day at that day you shall know that I'm in my father father and ye in me and I in you so now he starts to speak of Oneness as now he is in the uh he is in the father and now and then and then we are in Christ and then Christ is in us so if he's in the father and we're in him and he's in us then you're seeing Oneness this is the promise so then when Jesus is departing then he in in Acts chapter 1 he tells them to T in Jerusalem uh and wait for the promise of the Father which I spoke unto you this is the promise so this is the promise that they're waiting for so on the day of Pentecost when it was full come in the go he brought the promise he came he Jesus came back in the form of the Holy Ghost he came back to indwell his church and he did it at a a specific time and he did it in specific way because he knew who would be gathered for the Feast of Pentecost and he happened to know all the languages that would be represented and he knew how to get them to speak with other tongues but even though they were speaking with other tongues he knew how to anoint the ears of The Listener so the ears of The Listener heard they everyone heard them in their own tongue so it wasn't just the tongue that was anointed it was the ear that was anointed too so God was working a sign he was fulfilling his promise and so now let's go to um Acts 2 again let's go back to Acts chapter 2 and we're going to finish this section so when we get to verse 12 it says and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what means this others mocked and said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my my servants and on my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great notable day of the Lord go of the Lord come I just want to stop for a minute and and say that in verse 19 when he says and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth Ben beneath blood and Fire vapor smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood he's he's quoting Old Testament prophecy he's bringing it into his day because just 50 days earlier at the Feast of Passover it turned dark in the middle of the day and if you go to that calendar date in history to that Passover on that day in history when the moon Rose Over the Horizon at the evening of Passover it was a blood moon so 50 days early the sun was turned to Darkness and the moon was turned to blood so he was showing them signs from his day now realize we've had signs in our day in the heavens above we've had amen a pillar of fire that the picture has been taken of amen and it's been verified amen by a researcher of documentation and photography there's also been a picture of a mysterious Cloud taken in the air in our day amen and that cloud has been circulated all over the world Amen and also studied by by scientist you you find out that that that we we're running on Parallel tracks here so as he's quoting Old Testament prophecy he's saying hey in that day the sun's going to be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood and it had just happened a little bit before the Lord praise God so what is he doing he's bringing prophecy to his day this is what Peter's doing now verse 20 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved you men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and forn knowledge of God you have taken by Wicked hands and have crucified and slain whom God has raised up having loosed the Pains of the Pains of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it for David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou H has made known to me the ways of life Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance men and Brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his sepor is with us this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on the throne he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not uh left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which you now see and hear for David has not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy foot stol therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God ha made the same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ so on the day of Pentecost the faith of the Pentecostal Believers when it was first expressed and the in the spirit of Truth when it came into the disciples they Spilled Out into the street being anointed to speak with other tongues and they were speaking of the glory of God that's what everybody was hearing in their own language then when they questioned it Peter stood up to preach being full of the Holy Ghost and as he stood up to preach he started preaching modern events made clear by prophecy I mean we could put that title onto a sermon modern events what he's saying he's saying this is that which Joel said and this is what David said and this is who Jesus was and this is the sign you're seeing and this is why it's come and this is what's happening why because he received the spirit of Truth amen this is the faith so what is the faith of the Pentecostal fathers the faith of the Pentecostal father fathers is this is the day that these scriptures are being fulfilled praise God uh in The Sixth Seal brother bam says the Apostle Peter at the day of Pentecost how he went back in the word and got the word and he said Joel said in the last days these things will take place and this is that and 3,000 believed and were baptized what was it he was tying the the prophecy to his day amen he now knew what he knew what was going on in his day something came into him and he had the boldness where he had fear before and they were hiding in the upper room amen now all of the sudden in boldness he comes out amen they they have this great sign and this Wonder that's taking place and when the crowd's questioning it Peter who was afraid Peter who ran away at the at the Judgment of Jesus Christ Peter who was hiding in an upper room Peter now is the one who stands up being full of the Holy Ghost and he starts saying no I know where I'm at now in the scriptures I know exactly what I'm talking about this is that this is Joel this is David this is the scriptures praise God remember we're talking about the faith of the fathers that's what we're being turned back to see let's let's continue reading now uh let's go to verse 37 and finish this up now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said un Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words he did testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untour generation then they that gladly received the word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 Souls so je they want to know what do we do in Peter first response is repent but we know the crowd the crowd was devout Jews not harlots and prostitutes and drunkers and thieves and amen who needed to repent the religious the religious people of that day who had missed the word in that day now when they were confronted with somebody who full of the Holy Ghost could stand up and say this is that and tie the scripture to their day now they say all that pricked my heart amen the preaching the preaching of Peter pricked their heart and the preaching of Peter was Modern events made clear by prophecy and that's what pricked their heart when he tied what they saw and what had been happening all around them back to the prophecy and saying this is the day this is the time what you're seeing is the Fulfillment of what we've been told that message pricked their heart amen and under that preaching when their heart was pred he said repent not from smoking not from drinking not from adultery repent from your wrong understanding of the word and your wrong understanding of the scripture repent in this day amen that day is repent from your Jewish Traditions repent from all that you have inherited down through the generations repent and now come to The Living Truth in this day it's repent from denominationalism repent from traditions of man repent from your ideas and turn amen and come to the fullness of the word praise God on in the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day oh this is such a good quote we're supposed to turn back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers but he's saying the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride the gold home of the Bride so there's another message that's falling in this day the same message that should turn our hearts back to the fathers but it can't be the same word that fell then there cuz the word that fell then there was Modern events made clear by prophecy for that day but we have to have modern events made clear by prophecy for this day so that word won't work in this day this is for the the bride going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecostals represent that again now he's talking about the Pentecostal Revival from 1906 they represent that because it was a restoration of the gifts some of the same gifts that fell on that day and fell at the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but they represent that but that the word that fell is not for our day there's another word for our day and I just want you to think for a minute the word that fell on that day won't work today we got something different than that this is for the bride for the going home of the Bride but the word that's falling today has to be the word that turns our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers but it can't be the same word that fell that day prise God so it's got to turn us back to the the faith that they had here but it can't be the same thing they heard there it's got to be a different word a different prophecy to bring us to the same Faith but not by the same preaching not the same word but the same Faith so whatever we hear in our day has to bring us to the same Faith they had in their day okay just keep moving the word that fell I I've been reading that over and over this is for the bride the going home of the Bride we got something different the Pentecost Apostles represent that again we're in the bride age no more than the word of Noah would work in the day of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here that's right so this is a uh to me this becomes one of those very interesting quotes because we've got to have a word that turns us back to the faith of those fathers there but we can't have the same word they had but we have to come to the same faith prise God Amen I love things like this the Le in Church age from the church age book he said now I I've been reading this the last couple services so you're familiar with this now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things so it's one messenger fulfilling multiple scriptures and he's going to do two things uh one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so that's what we're talking about and the question is how is he going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers then he says two he will reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so now we have to our hearts have to be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers but we can't use the word that fell on their day we have to have a different word what word is it going to be it's going to be the preaching of the seven Thunders the unwritten portion of the word what wasn't recorded in the Bible under those Thunders what what John was told not to write was saved for an end time amen and under the end time messenger in the end time that seal would be open and when that seal was open then those Mysteries that were in the seven Thunders would be preached where under the seals and that event that Revelation is supposed to turn our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal father so that we have the same Faith they had amise now remember what faith did Peter have this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes that's the faith that he had what faith are we supposed to have this day this scripture out of the Book of Revelations is fulfilled in your eyes this is fulfilled scripture we're here what you're seeing amen is the product of fulfilled scripture what we're here to testify to you is this day this scripture is fulfilled that was the faith that that they had amen praise God so in the Rapture message he says now Revelation 10: 1-7 all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride by the messenger of the leodan church so here we have all the players Revelation 10 1-7 that's the coming that's the descending of the mighty angel with an open book in his hand that's the sounding of the seven Thunders that's the Declaration that time is no more and that's the Revelation uh the mystery of God being revealed Revelation 10: 1:7 that is all the Mysteries are to be revealed to the bride that's the only one they'll be revealed to that's right by the messenger of the leodan church he's the only one that's going to do the preaching I mean the only one that going bring the revelation of the seven Thunders so so we know who the messenger of the latan church is but now we got to know who the bride is and the bride's the one who's received the revelation of Revelation 10 1-7 that's who the bride is amen amen praise God then he goes on to say this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ brother Brandon Pat's Bible so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the Seven Seals had the mystery hit of what it all was and is supposed to be open in the last day at the leodan age at the end of time thanks be to God that finishes the message to the church that finishes it when they look back and see what has been and see where it's all brought up to that finishes it the age of the church so what finishes the age of the church the opening of the seals finishes the age of the church what finishes the age of the dispensation of the LA La the the Feast of Pentecost that day of Pentecost amen when after Jesus Christ died on Calvary amen it was Calvary that ended it now they're moving into a dispensation of Grace and now on the Feast of Pentecost when the spirit of Truth come upon them they come out and start preaching it what are they preaching a dispensational change we're changing from law to Grace we're coming out of the traditions of the fathers and we're moving to the New and Living Way that's been opened before us by what by the blood of Jesus Christ so that's what's happened well now at the opening of the seals we're having the same event now that finishes the message to the church that finishes the age of the church and it opens up the bride age it's a dispensational change just like in that day they were calling to The Devout Jews from every nation that came for the Feast of Pentecost what were they doing they were calling them out of the tradition of the fathers and bringing them to the children amen Amen to the New and Living Way that was opened by Calvary and now the message in this hour is calling out of Pentecost and World Traditions out of denominations out of churches out of man-made out of Creeds and dogmas out of all of these things and calling us to the bride age amen brother B says in the third seal while he's preaching the seals he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet he's talked before about church revivals there's been stirrings in every Church age there's been stirrings but but he's he's very specific now he says there's no been no Revival to there hasn't the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been things going on churches yet and bride was part of that and it was calling a bride in each in each Church age we understand all of those things but now he's being very specific in what he's saying there's not been uh bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's no been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again to wake her up again when he says wake her up again she must have been awake at one point right this is why we're going back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers because they were awake right there at the day of Pentecost and shortly after they were wide awake to their word they were wide awake to their place and time they were wide awake to their prophecies they were wide awake to who they were and who Christ was and what had happened in their day they were wide awake to it but they'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again to do what to bring her back to the faith of the Pentecostal father all right let's go to Matthew 17 I hope you can tell I'm I'm intentionally holding myself back God Amen it seems like you can just just just get overly excited I guess Matthew 17:10 he says and his disciples asked him saying why then shall the scribes say Elias must first come in the New Testament Elias is Elijah of the Old Testament same person same word Elijah must come first and Jesus answered and said unto him Elias truly shall first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they list is likewise shall also the son of man suffer so brother brandham says Jesus right there is showing you the two comings of Elijah he's showing he's referring back to John the Baptist Eli has come already and they've done what him with him what they listed but he said first Elias truly shall first come he's speaking of the future yes and restore all things and we know that that Jesus is very deliberate in what he's saying amen because of the prophecy in Malachi 4 but also we know that John the Baptist didn't restore anything his ministry was prepare the way that's right so he had a preparing Ministry to prepare the way for the Lord he wasn't restoring back because if he was restoring back he would have to take him back to the law of Moses so his was not a restoration Ministry his was a preparation Ministry but he's saying but Elijah will come shall come first there's coming an Elijah who will restore so there has to be a restoration Ministry what is the restoration it's a restoration back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that we've been talking about Acts chapter 2 so that's part that's the Malachi 4 so what's going to accomplish this restoration it's going to be those seven unknown Thunders amen praise God in the message influence brother says the power of God the end time is here remember the seventh seal is the end time seal so just keep that in your mind the seven seal is the end time seal brother Brenham is the end time Prophet he's the messenger of the seventh seal all of these things are marking the end time so brother R is saying the end time is here he's not saying the end time is coming the end time is here the angel has gathered up the Loose Ends and we're here what Angel the seventh angel which is himself has gathered up the lucians and we're here he's not talking future he's talking present he was a he said amen he was about to write those Thunders he's talking about John now in Revelation 10 he was about to write those Thunders he said don't write them seal them up and at that day of the sounding of this last seventh angel seventh Church age the leodan church Age The Mystery of God all about God how that God is not a big bunch of gods but one God and all those other things should be all be finished in that time the great battles back before had got the Loose Ends hanging out it ought to be all wrapped up together in this last age then when that sounds an angel come down and said time shall be no more I'll swear by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more oh my we are here brother sister we're at the time amen let's let the Holy Spirit influence us to the word of God now that he says we're at that time now what should be happening now let's let the Holy Spirit influence us to the to the word of God let's let God do the influencing in our hearts this is the message influence and not be influenced by others yes sir now that we're at this time amen let's let this Holy Ghost be our only influence not others not Traditions not anything else now he's coming right down to where he was at and Christ is the mystery of God revealed to the individual Revelation one person one man hell is against this Revelation the Revelation to the individual amen that's what we're coming down to he says now let's let's let the Holy Ghost let's let God do the influencing in our hearts and not be influenced by others this ought to put us in action with reverence and humility the pillar of fire vindicating among us again like it was bringing the children of Israel signs of coming is at hand was there signs of his coming at hand in brother rand's day he says the word by the word being fulfilled we see the Promise amen how do we see the Promise by the word being fulfilled what word revelation 10: 1-7 that in the days of the seventh angel the mystery of God shall be finished so word the word by the word being fulfilled we see the Promise the last days he would pour out his spirit so now listen if you go back to the prophecy that Peter was giving of Joel on the on the day of Pentecost when he began to preach he began to talk about in that day I will pour out my spirit is that right the day of Pentecost amen it was the coming of the Holy Ghost the spirit of God was going to be pouring out and now was going to come and indwell human beings and and now brother Brenham is now coming to the end time coming to the to the the word being fulfilled so that we see the promise but he says what's it going to do at the last day he will pour out his spirit because the prophecy was in the last day I will pour out my spirit and Peter was coming and saying Now's the Time For That fulfillment but now she's got to wake up again she woke up there but she went to sleep amen through the church ages but she's got to wake up again and the Holy Ghost has to pour upon her again how will we see the Promise at the fulfilling of the word amen so he said now this is what he said this ought to put us in action with reverence and humility this ought to move us into action because why when it fell upon them in the day of Pentecost it moved them into action Amen in this day when we see the Fulfillment of the word amen it should move us into action it should give us faith in the first seal he says I think now he wrote this but when he started to write these other seven Thunders he said don't write it he'd been commissioned to write everything he seen speaking again of John in the Book of Revelation but when these seven Thunders over in Revelation 10 uttered he said don't write them at all they're they're Mysteries we don't know what they are yet now where's he at in time he's in the first seal he's preaching the first seal we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away right because he's preaching the seals this week and when it do and when it do it'll give faith for that rapturing Grace for the church to move out amen when those when those Unwritten word those seven Thunders that John would not able to write but seal up when the mystery of that comes forth he says in my opinion they'll be revealed right away and when it do it'll give faith for that rapturing Grace for the church to move move out so what's it going to do it's going to bring a faith that'll get the church to move out to move out of what ultimately to move out of this condition and move out of hybridization and move out of this dimension in a translation ultimately but the first step in that is to move out of denominational systems come out from among her my people that's the first move and it's going to take this revelation of the word to give us Faith amen a Rapture to get the church to move out amen so now brother brandham in The Rapture message he says now remember in the in the days of the seventh angel his sounding forth blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is to finish all the mysteries of God so brother brenham's Ministry was a blowing of a trumpet now this isn't the seventh trumpets that's going to be the Israel amen this was the seventh gospel trumpet he was a seven Church age messenger every messenger he blew a trumpet and what was the trumpet he said it denotes a war brought out spiritual he brought a revelation from God which started a spiritual war but a trumpet he says here further down the Rapture message he said now notice the trumpet is to call together the people assemble themselves together for something sometimes it announces an important person coming he said sometimes it calls the war or announces an important person coming amen maybe it could do both at the same time start a spiritual war and announce an important person coming but here brother brandham blew the seventh gospel trumpet and that gospel trumpet is an in gathering amen the Feast of trumpets the Feast of trumpets is an in gathering the blowing of the trumpets was to gather all of Israel for the Feast of trumpets now in the seventh and final Church age trumpet amen what's he doing it's an in gathering of the people of God what's he Gathering them to he's Gathering them to Christ under this great Revelation to what give them faith to move out move out of what he's Gathering them from where where is he Gathering them from he's Gathering them from the Traditions he's Gathering them from the false Doctrine he's Gathering them from false Christianity he's Gathering them out of the denominational and church ages and he's Gathering them to the bright age amen now in the first seal again he says when there's coming forth seven mysterious Thunders that's not even written written at all that's right and I believe that through these seven Thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing Faith Lord so the these sounding of these seven Thunders are supposed to get the bride together it's an in gathering it's the blowing of a trumpet amen because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it he said it's going to take a higher Faith there's something we've got to step further we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing hardly we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth so we've got to come higher than the church ages we got to Step Beyond the limitations of church ages we' got to be called out by a trumpet by the sounding of the seven Thunders amen by the Mysteries being revealed however you want to whatever terminology it's all the same thing amen when when this Revelation strikes it gives the church Faith to move out to gather together amen for what for the faith that they're going to need to move completely out yes so in the Rapture message brother says therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout when he talks about the Rapture he talks about the Rapture as a cycle the Rapture is not a momentary event we know there's a culmination that's the change in the body and the meeting in the air but the change in the body meeting in the air is preceded amen by a Rapture cycle that brings us to the this point in time and it starts with a shout and moves to a voice of the Archangel amen and then the Trump of God which that trumpet is an end Gathering what Gathering Gathering all the way home because a trumpet is a gathering calling the people in assembly so he takes that out of 1 Thessalonians 4:15 where he says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout yes with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God there's your three phases to the rapture we could put it that way brother B brings us out in the Rapture message but as the Lord descends the Lord himself shall descend from heaven and when the Lord descends from Heaven the first thing that he does he descends with a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth to gather the bride to gather the elect and so what that that's that last final gospel trumpet blowing that's the in gathering out of the church into the bride AE separated from traditions and it's so very similar to the day of Pentecost when that gospel trumpet blew amen modern events made clear by prophecy he says we're not living in a Pentecostal age we're living in another age and brother R says the lat in church age is the Pentecostal age we're living in another age see we're not living in a Methodist age we're living in another age we're living on up here to the bride age the calling out of the church and getting it together for the Rapture what what message is this modern events made clear by prophecy what are the modern events made clear by prophecy all of these things that were prophesied to happen they're happening and what are they supposed to be doing calling out the church and getting it together for the Rapture amen that's the age that we're now living to my honest opinion that's exactly the truth now in the Feast of trumpets now I know I'm reading a lot of quotes so please just hang with me but these things these things that I don't want to take the authority to say myself I want to know that the prophet said these things Amen in the Feast of trumpets he said there was three stages of it now what he's talking about is three stages of the church ages there was the martyr's age that was the early age amen uh when when the church when the false Vine began to p Ute the True Vine all the way back in the first age it began so starting with the first age was the martyr's age and that came all the way down to the Dark Ages amen where martyrdom hit its peak so the first stage of the church Ages was the martyr's age the then the stage of the reformers and the reformers was coming out of the Dark Ages and trying to reform the Church out of Catholicism and bring back the word and it came through three stages it came through Luther Wesley and Pentecost the Pentecostal Revival was part of the Reformation then the stage of the reformers and now the calling out time so what is the bride age the calling out time what were the seven Thunders supposed to do call us out what was the revelation of the Mysteries being revealed to do the opening of the seals call us out this is the falling out time when finished at leodan age according to Revelation 10 the mystery of all the Bible would be known to the bride is that right Revelation 10 listen close now um bride called out by the word Christ himself calling out the bride making plain Hebrews 138 that he's the same yesterday today and forever does the same is the same amen so who's calling out the bride amen it's Christ calling out the bride how is Christ calling out the bride by revealing the Mysteries by opening the word because Christ is the anointed word and it's the anointed word that is calling us out amen the revealing of the Mysteries that we hidden and revealed till the end time what's it do it's calling us out amen and that is Christ calling to his bride by his word now in the anointed ones at the end time says now the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message so now he's telling you that when the messenger starts on he's going to go into the three pools now he's going to go into the the first part of the ministry with was laying his hands on and having a sign in the hand then the discernment amen and then there's going to be a third pull but he's saying not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it I want to with all of my heart Lord give me the eyesight so I read this because I want to go back to the prophecy or to the vision brother bham has at the end of 1955 where we get the term three pools because remember in the vision we've been through it before but if you'll just forgive me for going slow I don't want to lose anybody by just hammering all these details out in the in the vision he was fishing he was by L fishing and there was Brethren all around ministers all around fishing and they were all catching little fish amen but he could see in the deep water was rainbow trout and the rainbow trout rainbow is a sign of the Covenant when God put a a rainbow in the uh Sky After the flood it was a covenant he would never destroy the Earth with a flood again so these fish are Covenant fish these are special fish and he said they're big ones and they're in the deep water and he thinks he said I thought to myself I think I can catch them so he begins the three PS are the tactics of fishing so he throws the lure out and he gives it a little pull when he gives it a pull it attracts the little fish now the fish represent people right it catches it attracts the attention all the little fish run to the lure is what brother benam says and that was the healing the sign in the hand when he went forth it was a sign people could see Supernatural was God and attracted so many people yes and the second tactic of fishing once all the little fish uh all the little fish gather around then you pull it again he said when you pull it again that scares some of the little fish away and that was the discernment the prophesying that's when they started to think you're reading people's minds that's telepathy and it scared away some of the little fish and when they scattered that got the attention of the big fish the ones that he was actually [Applause] targeting and they moved up to the lure amen but the third pull was the third time that he was going to pull which was the the time that he was actually going to set the hook into the jaw of the targeted species the the giant rainbow trout the Covenant fish the children of God that he was trying to catch and what was the third pull it was the opening of the word the revealing of the Mysteries that was what he was going to do to hook the fish the people of God and then once he hooked them what was the whole purpose the whole purpose was to bring them back again a restoration to retrieve them amen to bring them back to catch themen to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers it was a bringing back it was pulling out it was a retrieving back to God see there's the the message is simple but my goodness if you think of the ways brother brandham described it and try to put it all in one you've got three pools and and you've got church ages and a bride age and then you've got uh Thunders and you've got seals and and all the ways that he tried to explain it if I would just put it all on paper it'd be like it just fill volumes of paper and the things that he did but he's always trying to get us to one understanding all of these things are trying to drive us to one understanding to get one picture to see one thing clearly that what's that one thing is God is trying to get his children and bring them back to their original position as a gentile as a as a bride amen and that they were they started out in Pentecost before they went to the church ages and fell away from the word they never went on to the full Revelation okay let's keep going modern events made clear by prophecy again so we're not living in the Methodist age the Baptist age we're living in the bride Age The Calling bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in what is the bride age it's a bringing back to God through a channel what's the channel the third pool what's the third pull the opening of the word the revealing of the Mysteries this is why when brother benam was in Sabino Canyon before he meets the constellation of angels he's up there in about January hand in the air praying sword strikes his hand the voice says this the king sword and he says there's only one sword of the king amen and that's the word am what is it the word coming to him what word the one that's not been interpreted yet the White Rock all the see these are all terms if I start just lacing through them like that our head's going to be spinning so I don't want to do that I'm trying hard not to do that but I want us to catch the picture all of that is bringing us to one thing he's trying to use the opening of the word to call his bride back to her position that's when he talks about a White Rock Under The Rock and he talks about a third thir pool when he talks about seven Thunders and Seven Seals all of these things when he talks about the end time the end time seal all of these things are denoting the same thing all of it is God trying by the opening of the word Christ calling to his bride amen he's trying by the opening of the word to bring his bride back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers praise God Amen back to her original position now in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says now notice god making himself known now we're not supposed to make converts to Christ by a government but by the Revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ amen now this is where I want to pay some real close attention so if you weren't paying attention before pay attention now pent your neighbor all right you don't make commer to Christianity by a government but by the Revelation the Christ in you so now we're coming to a higher Revelation it's Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you when what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God God in Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that wonderful oh my I like that Jesus said at that day then brother B said that's this day he's getting ready to go back to the to to where we read from John 14 when Jesus Promised the coming of a comforter the spirit of Truth and he said I won't leave you comforter I'll come to you and in that day in that day you'll know that I am in the father I uh I in you and you in me amen yes I may get that wrong but one thing I want you to know is it's all together how many ever times I say it wrong we get the same picture and and that was what Jesus Jesus laid that down as he was getting ready to depart from his disciples and he says now I'm going away but I pray the father he's going to send you another comforter and he says then that comforter is going to be the spirit of truth and he says in other places that he'll lead and guide you into all truth he'll take the things I spoke to you and bring it to your remembrance and he show you things to come so he's showing that this spirit is going to bring you revelation of the word and then he says but I won't leave you comfortless I will come to you amen and in that day that I come to you you'll know that I am in the father you in me and I in you amen so there's a Oneness between the father in Christ and the believer and so then when Jesus resurrects from the dead is seen of his disciples he gathers them together he speaks to them right before he leaves in Acts chapter 1 he says tear you in Jerusalem and wait for the promise of the father that I spoke to you about what is the promise of the father he spoke to him about this was the promise that the comforter is coming that's right he he said it many ways in many ways he said my father will come to you and I will come to you and we'll make our abod in you all right now brother Brandon is preaching Christ is the mystery of God reveal after the opening of The Seven Seals and he's talking about the day in which we live in today and he's going to grab the same scripture amen and he's going to bring the same scripture to a fulfillment today he said Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you in me Hallelujah when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me then when the revelations comes forth then it's I in you and you in me there you are see the manifold threefold manifestation what for what for to bring it back praise God back to what back to what it was at Pentecost praise God am now oh God help me I get so fooled that I don't know how to bring it out it just gets so full so you're going to have to bring it out work a little harder now praise God at that day at the Feast of Pentecost that's right when they were hiding in the upper room when they were afraid of the Jews when they weren't certain what to do when they had this confusion now they're waiting and they don't know exactly what they're waiting for they don't exactly what it's going to look like don't what it's going to happen and then they're nervous about the authorities and they've got all this going on listen at that day they knew that he was in the father and the father was in him they knew that they knew he was the Messiah they knew he was the son of the Living God they knew he alone had the words of eternal life they knew he had died and and that he had resurrected and that he ascended on high they knew all of that they had faith in all of that they witnessed to that and they believed it all but it seems like they needed something a little higher in the Revelation because that Revelation had them hiding that Revelation had them uncertain that Revelation I mean still had Peter going back to fishing and all kinds of stuff but they needed the next step in the Revelation and that next step in the Revelation would come in that day you'll know that I'm in the father you and me and I in you now you're part of the mystery you're part of the plan what changed at Pentecost at Pentecost God by filling them with his Spirit made them the Fulfillment of the word and part of the prophecy then they rush out with boldness then they know the word then they speak the word then they preach with boldness then they look into then they look into the lame man that says look unto us look unto us why they're now part of it it's inside of them they're in Christ and Christ is in them and it changes everything for themall and at this day amen at that day that's this day prise God I'm going to read that again brother said Jesus said at that day that's this day amen now we're bringing now now we're not leaving it back 2,000 years ago but God's going to do the same thing to bring us right back to their condition at that day that's this day at that day when when the Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me amen we believe that he died and he resurrected he sit in my 4 there was a prophet we believe all of those things but there's something we need just a little bit higher he said I and you and you and me he said when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father in me then when the Revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you in me that's why brother bandom starts this message with Christ the you Christ in you the hope of glory why because that's the restoration back to the faith of the fathers when they come on the day of Pentecost they knew Jesus was the son of God they knew he had the words of eternal life they knew he and the father were one they knew he had died on Calvary they knew he had resurrected back to life they knew there was a resurrection of the sleeping Saints they knew they had ascended on high they knew all of that but there was something else they needed to know they needed to know that that was now in them and they're part of this whole thing praise God Amen praise God you can see this Revelation is revealed only to his beloved bride why why maybe she needs to be called out by the Revelation to have enough Faith to come out in the rapture maybe she needs to have enough Faith to separate and recognize I am the bride I am the bride it's me that's the that prophet's talking about me the message is speaking of me it's me Mama it's me that's the one that I see amen there has to be something that this Revelation does to the individual to call them out and bring them to a greater Faith what to do to bring them back again amen amen praise God now in the Masterpiece brother says it's because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is a smitten piece off of him there is the Masterpiece what is it it's the Revelation we're part of Christ Michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back he's talking about when he struck a piece off of his great Moses sculptor he could never put it back he said but God is going to do it amen he is going to bring his little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original Worden and there he is there is the Masterpiece the family back again in the Garden of Eden how is the bride going to do this how is the wheat going to do this Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back restored by back like the beginning take it back amen I will restore say the Lord all the years that the palmerworm the cankerworm all these other things has eaten I will restore again Malachi 4 said he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to the original fathers again see we see this right before us Church where are we at now closing in a few minutes I want you to notice real close of something that just happened Malachi 4 is to bring back back to the original oh yeah the faith of the Pentecostal fathers when they could stand out there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and guess what if you want to know where it's at look on us amen he's filled us with his Spirit he's given us the Revelation and the power to come and Proclaim to you the word amen oh praise God praise God Malachi for is to bring back to the original isn't it amazing that on the day of pent gos when Peter stood up and he quoted he first quoted from Joel his first quote was from Joel this is that which is spoken by the prophet of Joel now when brother Brenham comes to the Masterpiece he shows now there's another prophecy laying in Joel there was one prophecy for 2,000 years ago there's another prophecy that is span 2,000 years and coming to culmination in our time and it's another prophecy and the day that the re revealing of the word is going to bring us back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers there's another prophecy in Joel that a prophet in our day is going to stand up and tell us and that's the prophecy of all that the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm and the Locust has eaten what's that they that's that Roman bug that eat it down through seven Church ages that destroyed the truth of the word the original Apostolic teaching and ruined the faith of the fathers and brought it down to nothing and restored it back through three stages in the fourth stage which is life which is word amen what's he going to do I will restore sayeth the Lord restore what restore my bride back to what she was before these ganker worms started eating at it where's that prophecy in Joel it starts off with Joel it ends with Joel God what is Malachi 4 going to do bring us back back to where back to the side of the word when it first came forth before it was tainted back to Union with Christ back to a bride age what did she come out she came out of Pentecost a virgin Bride for Christ but be in the first age she was already a fallen woman because she had taken the denominational ideas of man amen so what's he bringing her back to he's bringing her back by the BL washing of the bleeding word what's he doing he's restoring her back by washing away all the false all the lies to bring her back to this original truth what is this original truth I in you and you in me we are coming to a union a marriage bride remember when he says bride age bride age the term bride has to do with [Applause] relationship it's a title that changes the noting who this person is not woman not just Assembly Church but now bride amen which means this is the one that I'm uniting with I in you you in me brother said that makes them all one the message when their eyes were open they knew him 1964 he says remember in Malachi 4 not Malachi 3 now Malachi 4 God promised to send the anointing again what did the opening of the word bring an anointing amen promise to send the anointing again restore the faith of the children back to the fathers again and it's exactly what God promised Joel amen praise God I want to read just two more things for you in the Rapture we're back in the Rapture message the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they're caught up together and the the trumpet the feast in the heavens and the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen we've already been separated we've already been gathered the call has gone forth the bride is being separated the shuck is pulling back what is it we're doing now maturing ripening cuz this Revelation was to bring us back praise God back to what the smitten peace that was smitten off being restored back to Christ amen the brid tree restored the fellowship coming back the relationship coming backen that's why brother brandom in the first seal he says I'll no longer call you church but I'll call you bride so that you'll understand it prise God what is the bride age it's a calling out amen it's a restoring back it's going back to the faith of the original Pentecostal fathers I've used that term so many times it lost meaning for me but by the grace of God when we stop and just ask God what does it mean what is the faith of the fathers oh it's that Faith they had when they come spilling out that upper room that they had just received the promise they were part of it it was alive inside of them what is the original faith of to the fathers I am part of this Revelation it's in me I want to spill out of church and spill out of my study and spill out of everything and I want to go tell the world look on us praise God Amen such as I have I'd love to give unto you amen you can be restored too praise God by this gospel trumpet you can be called out too you can be restored under the ministry of Malachi 4 you can come out of her my people amen what message does the bride pick up in Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride what do they say come come she's picked up the same message not a different message the same message what was the message she picked up come out from among her my people and be ye separate thus sayeth the Lord and I will receive your sacrifices what message did we pick up come come it's a calling out a calling forth a Mali 4 uh revealing of the Mysteries to what to restore back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers amen amen in the day we live in there's so many people that are sitting like those disciples were sitting in the upper room we know he came we know he died we know he resurrected we know it was true we saw all the signs but they were still sitting there wondering sitting there afraid sitting there uncertain and insecure so many people in the world are in the same position we know the word is true we know the Bible is true we saw all the things that happen in the prophet's Ministry we know he's got to be a man of God and that's wonderful friends but don't just sit there say God I need the same thing they got at Pentecost I need I need you I need you and me and me and you I need to know that I'm part of it that it's inside of me that you give me life and boldness and Revelation and you spill me out of this upper room so that I can go and live and manifest and declare this mystery alive inside of me God Amen to me friends just to me that's the restoration back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that's where their heart was their Revelation their understanding that's what gave them the boldness and the courage to die for what they believe to give their life to Proclaim it I said God I need yes the same thing that you gave them amen but praise God we know it's here not in measure anymore because brother BM said it was a dip in Luther and a dip in Wesley it was portioned out but there's not portioned down anymore because the Holy Ghost has made a full return the Full Life of Christ came with the fullness of the word and everything that was poured out in them is being poured out now in his bride full potential full outpouring full life is here I'm saying God I've met your requirements I've waited on you now give me what you gave them there because this is the day you're taking me back to the same Revelation in that day that's this day I'll know that I'm in you and you're in me praise be to God and that's the faith of the original Pentecostal fa amen God bless you as you stand praise God stand to our feet and say oh God I'm so thankful Lord I'm not living in the day of portion I'm not so I'm so thankful you given me eyes to see you fulfilled your word you fulfilled the promise and you've let me see it you put something in me to believe it and what does that do for me you say well of course I believe it of course I see it I know I can see what those Thunders are do you know how rare that is do you know how unusual it is for you to actually have the ability to see it and believe it and have no resistance inside of you and say I that's nothing but the truth you know what that means this Revelation is given only to his beloved bride what's he trying to do he's trying to call you by the revelation of the word and say it's me it's me and you're part of me and you belong to me won't you come out and Unite with [Music] [Applause] Meen oh you don't understand sometimes we don't understand what a precious thing Revelation is the revelation of the word is the Vindication it's the it's the identification because this is revealed only to his beloved bride say oh God thank you for restoring me back to the faith of the Pentecostal what did it Malachi 4 how did Malachi 4 do it those mysterious truth why why is it so important listen I'm sorry I'm going over time but to me I just want to lay this in why is it so important that those Thunders were were were revealed that the seals were open why because listen it brother B said it was the unwritten part of the scriptures amen John was told not to write it nothing he said nothing wrote about it opening of the seven seal silence why is that so important amen it's not so we can get a whole bunch of information under the seals that information is critical and important and will help your life but this is just to me what it means is no human being ever could put an interpretation to that cuz there was nothing written nobody could guess nobody could come up with any idea even brother Brenham said I've read all these books and nobody even knows that there's Seven Seals to be open they don't even know that the Thunders are to be revealed in the end time what does that mean that means if this is the revealing of those seven Thunders then that is Jesus Christ himself calling to his bride and he's proving it by re revealing the unwritten portion of the word that was sealed to the end time showing that he's here the king is here with the book in his head calling for his Queen to come stand by his side and if you're hearing the call who does that make you and what is your potential and what is he calling you to do come stand by my side hallelujah amen then what does it mean to come stand by his side oh I love questions amen I love to question myself what is does it mean to come stand by his side to me to me it means to come and align myself with his word and his thinking in this message to come shoulder toosh shoulder with him and come in alignment and agreement and harmony with this revelation of this word for this end time he's come the King has come with a book in his hand and he's calling for his Queen to come stand by his side hallelujah amen say God that's the greatest desire of my heart I hear you calling I can hear the call I hear it I see it I feel it I sense it it's all over me God give me the courage to climb to that platform and Stand By Your Side to surrender my will will to yield myself completely to give up all of my thinking and my tradition help me to come and Stand By Your Side to stand in alignment in harmony with the fullness of the word [Music] that's the privilege we have in this day and that's the message he's using to bring us back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers praise God I count myself the luckiest human being to be on the face of the Earth and that word lucky may we know it's Divine Providence but I feel lucky anyhow I know it's not luck but that's the feeling that's all over me I'm the Most Blessed the most privileged and I'm the I'm so thankful I'm just so sorry that I haven't been thankful enough and given my life enough for what he's given to me oh praise God let's bow our heads together oh Heavenly Father we thank you God how you come up with such a beautiful plan how you've come in this end time and you've taken a human being and your prophet and you revealed the mystery that was in your mind and God we don't hear it as facts and figures and dates and times we hear it as you calling us to come Stand By Your Side God help us to heed the call to come and align ourselves with you to stand shoulder toosh shoulder with you not be ashamed of you but be proud thankful and grateful to stand alongside you in this hour God you've given us ears to hear we didn't do it Lord you did it amen just like on the original day of Pentecost there was nothing they did you told them where to go and where to stay not to move and that you would do something God when they went to where you told them doing what you told them using no mind of the own you came and did what you promised to do and here we are In the End Time Lord we didn't have any idea that Seven Seals needed to be open we didn't know that there was a revealed mystery that would bring a faith for a bride to come out to be caught up but God you came at the appointed time in the season and you did what you said you would do in spite of us amen God we're so thankful Lord help us to have grateful hearts Lord and surrendered lives God may you have your way with us as we surrender to you Lord help us to always have faith to wait on you to do what you said you would do oh we love you we thank you for this hour that we're living we pray God that you would take us into your hands and mold us into your very image all we can do is obey your voice and all we can do is Lay ourselves at your feet we can't fix ourselves we can't mold ourselves we can't equip ourselves we can't do anything except surrender God we surrender to you now and ask that that you come Lord and put us back to your side bring us back to the word and Lord fill us with your spirit Lord so in this day we will know that it's you and us and us and you thank you Father bless your people Lord as we go from here may we go Lord with Vigor with faith may we go like the prophet said May that put us in action like it did your early church may we continually give our lives to you AR fresh that you might use us for
