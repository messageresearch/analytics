[0:00] Jesus, Jesus,
[0:04] Jesus, sweetest name I
[0:09] know, fills my every
[0:13] longing. He keeps me singing as I
[0:18] go. And all my life was wrecked by sin
[0:23] and strife. And discord filled my heart
[0:27] with pain. pain. Jesus swept across
[0:31] those broken strings and stirred the
[0:35] suffering cords
[0:38] again. Oh Jesus, Jesus,
[0:43] Jesus, sweetest name I
[0:48] know fills my every
[0:52] long. Oh, he keeps me singing as I go.
[0:59] and feasting on the riches of his grace.
[1:04] Resting beneath the sheltering
[1:06] [Music]
[1:08] wings, always looking on his smiling
[1:12] face. Oh, that is why I shout. I'll sing
[1:16] verse four.
[1:18] Though sometimes he leads through wers
[1:22] deep and trials fall across the
[1:27] way. Though sometimes the path seems
[1:30] rough and steep. Sees his footprints all
[1:34] the way.
[1:37] Oh Jesus, Jesus,
[1:41] Jesus, fest name I
[1:46] know fills my every
[1:51] longing. He keeps me singing as I
[1:55] go. And soon he's coming back to welcome
[2:01] me far beyond that starry
[2:05] sky. I shall wing my flight to worlds
[2:10] unknown and I shall reign with him on
[2:14] high. For it's Jesus, Jesus,
[2:20] Jesus, sweetest name I
[2:25] know. Fills my every
[2:29] longing. He keeps me singing as I go.
[2:36] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[2:40] the narrow way. For the hand of God in
[2:44] all my life I
[2:47] see. And the reason of my bliss, the
[2:51] secret all is this, that the comforter
[2:55] abides with
[2:57] me. Oh, he
[3:00] abides. He abides.
[3:04] Oh hallelujah. He abided with
[3:08] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[3:13] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[3:16] abide with
[3:19] me. And once my heart was full of sin.
[3:23] Once I had no peace within. Till I heard
[3:26] out Jesus died on the
[3:30] tree. And I fell down at his feet. And
[3:34] there came a peace so sweet. Now the
[3:37] comforter abides with
[3:40] me. Oh he
[3:43] abides. He
[3:45] abides. Oh hallelujah. He abides with
[3:51] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[3:55] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[3:59] abides with me.
[4:02] Oh, he is with me everywhere and he
[4:05] knows my every care. I'm as happy as a
[4:09] bird and just as
[4:12] free. The spirit has control. Jesus
[4:16] satisfies my soul for the comforter
[4:20] abides in
[4:22] me. Yes, he

[4:32] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[4:36] walk the narrow way.
[4:39] Overcome abides with
[4:42] me. And there's no thirsting for the
[4:46] things of the world. They've taken
[4:48] wings. Oh, long ago I gave them up
[4:53] instantly. Now my night was turned to
[4:56] day. All my burdens rolled away. Now the
[5:00] comforter abides in
[5:03] me. He
[5:06] abides. Oh, he
[5:08] abides. Oh, hallelujah. He abides with
[5:14] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[5:18] walk the narrow way for the comforter
[5:22] abides. Oh, let's stand together. Let's
[5:24] sing that again. And he
[5:27] abides. He
[5:29] abides. Oh, hallelujah. He abides with
[5:34] me. I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[5:38] walk the narrow way. For the comforter
[5:42] abides with
[5:45] me. Amen. He abides with me this
[5:48] morning. Let's go to the key of sea.
[5:49] Let's sing this song. I living by faith.

[5:56] bring. His shadow or sunshine or
[6:00] rain. For the Lord I know ruleth for
[6:05] everything. And all of my worry is
[6:09] f. And I'm living by
[6:14] faith in Jesus
[6:19] above. I'm trusting
[6:24] confine in his great love. His great
[6:28] love from all harm's
[6:32] sake. It is sheltering
[6:37] on. I'm living by
[6:41] faith and I feel no alarm.
[6:47] And tempest may blow and the storm
[6:51] clouds arrive obscuring the brightness
[6:54] of
[6:55] life. Oh, I'm never alarmed at the
[6:59] overcast skies. Master looks on
[7:04] [Music]
[7:06] at
[7:09] faith in Jesus above.
[7:14] Oh, trusting

[7:22] love and from
[7:26] arms in a sheltering
[7:30] arm. Oh, I'm living by

[7:49] be. Why should I then care what tempest
[7:53] may blow? For Jesus flows to my

[8:55] harm's in his sheltering
[9:00] arm. I'm living by
[9:04] faith and I feel no
[9:08] alone. Amen. As brother Chad comes this
[9:11] morning, I will praise
[9:14] him. Oh,
[9:17] I will praise
[9:20] him. I'll
[9:23] praise the lamb for sinners slave.
[9:32] Oh,

[9:40] people for his blood has washed
[9:48] away. Verse one.
[9:52] And
[9:54] when I saw that cleansing
[10:01] fountain, it was
[10:04] old and wide for all my sin.
[10:10] [Music]
[10:12] And
[10:14] I oy the spirit's
[10:21] ruing. Oh, and he said will

[10:43] praise the lamb for sinners
[10:49] [Music]
[10:50] slain. Oh,
[10:53] give him
[10:55] glory all ye
[11:00] people. For his blood has washed away.
[11:06] each
[11:10] day. Amen. God bless you all. Let's bow
[11:13] our heads
[11:14] together. Pray. Lord Jesus, we're so
[11:17] thankful, God, for what you have done
[11:20] for us, Lord. We're so appreciative and
[11:23] it's an honor for us to stand here and
[11:25] sing of your glory and all the good
[11:27] things that you've done and to testify,
[11:29] Lord, with song and with mouth that
[11:32] you're wonderful, Lord. Lord, we're so
[11:34] privileged to be standing here today
[11:36] with the opportunity to hear your word.
[11:39] And God, may you come on the scene,
[11:41] Lord, and take control of this vessel.
[11:43] And may you bring your true word, your
[11:44] perfect word, through these imperfect
[11:47] lips, Lord. May you take control and may
[11:50] you speak to our hearts, Lord, and
[11:51] instruct us in the way of righteousness.
[11:54] May you encourage us, Lord, and
[11:55] enlighten us that we might know you
[11:57] better, Lord, and we might serve you
[11:58] better. May you have your way in this
[12:01] place. May you move, Lord, in every
[12:02] heart and every mind and every soul. May
[12:05] you take your liberty, Lord, as we give
[12:07] you preeminence. For we've invited you.
[12:09] We welcome you here, Lord. We surrender
[12:11] to you. We invite you to take your
[12:13] place, Lord, and to to be the head,
[12:15] Lord, and to and to take control, Lord,
[12:17] and to do as you wish, Lord. For we want
[12:20] to give you that privilege as we
[12:22] surrender to you. We love you and we ask
[12:24] for your help as we look into your word.
[12:26] May you give us the ISAB to see today
[12:29] what it is you're trying to show us. We
[12:32] love you. We thank you, God. May you
[12:34] bless these words and may you bless our
[12:36] efforts in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[12:40] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Um you can be
[12:44] seated for just a minute. Thank you
[12:48] musicians. Before we uh get into the
[12:51] word and to the scriptures, I have an
[12:53] announcement to make. There's been
[12:55] another engagement. Amen. Our sister
[12:58] Naomi Bondo has been engaged. God bless
[13:00] you, Sister Naomi. Could you stand up so
[13:02] we congratulate
[13:05] you?
[13:07] Amen. Thank you. Poor Wesley had to
[13:10] stand by himself and Naomi had to stand
[13:11] by herself, but she's engaged to brother
[13:14] Peter Ba and uh he resides in South
[13:17] Africa. He's originally from Congo.
[13:19] They've known his family for a long
[13:20] time. and the families know each other
[13:22] and so they're officially engaged.
[13:24] They've started the process and now
[13:26] they've got to go through a lot of
[13:27] paperwork process with the United States
[13:29] for him to get the visa to come. So just
[13:32] they're requesting prayer. So if you
[13:33] could be remembering them in prayer that
[13:35] God would speed up that process,
[13:37] expedite it so that the brother can come
[13:39] here quickly and they want to have their
[13:41] wedding here. They want to be wed here
[13:43] at the church, but they can't set the
[13:45] date yet obviously because they've got
[13:46] to get all the information. So just
[13:48] remember them in prayer and uh and uh
[13:51] that all that will work out well for
[13:53] them. And congratulations to the whole
[13:55] Bondo family.
[14:02] Amen. And as you can see, Brother
[14:04] Wesley's got a job today. He's
[14:06] translating for a friend of his. Amen.
[14:08] And so we we want to ask the Lord's
[14:10] blessing for him, too, as he's working
[14:12] today to bless his friend. Amen. God
[14:15] bless you. You're welcome. Good to have
[14:17] you. Also want to remind you that
[14:19] communion and feet washing will be this
[14:21] afternoon and so we'll gather back here
[14:23] this afternoon for that. Amen. Let's all
[14:26] stand
[14:27] together. I like having announcements.
[14:30] Amen. Exciting, fun to see God moving in
[14:34] hearts and lives and and God continuing
[14:36] to bless his people always is a blessing
[14:38] to me. And so I I find it a thrill and
[14:41] we thank God for what he's doing. If we
[14:44] could turn to Genesis chapter 2
[14:47] together, and we'll look at
[14:50] this
[14:56] together, Genesis chapter
[15:01] 2, and uh let's just read verse 8 and
[15:04] verse
[15:06] 9. And the Lord God planted a garden
[15:09] eastward in Eden, and there he put the
[15:11] man whom he had formed. And out of the
[15:13] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[15:15] tree that was pleasant to thee sight and
[15:17] good for food, the tree of life also in
[15:20] the midst of the garden, and the tree of
[15:22] knowledge of good and evil. Amen. God
[15:24] bless you as you have your seats and may
[15:26] God bless us as we look into his
[15:30] word. Amen. If we could pull up that
[15:33] PowerPoint that I've that we've got that
[15:35] Franco made for me. And uh I would like
[15:38] to talk this uh even this morning on the
[15:41] wall in Eden. The wall in Eden. And as
[15:44] we move forward, we'll see what we're
[15:46] referring to here. But if we this is the
[15:48] scripture that we just read. And it says
[15:50] God planted a garden eastward in Eden.
[15:52] And this word garden means an enclosure
[15:55] or an enclosed garden. Amen. So this you
[15:58] know we're dealing when we're dealing
[16:00] with the garden in the beginning, we're
[16:01] dealing with a metaphor. Anyways, God is
[16:04] showing us uh something in a typology
[16:07] and a metaphor and he's explaining to us
[16:09] many things. And as I've been uh was
[16:11] meditating on this, I thought there are
[16:14] so many things embedded in every picture
[16:16] God shows us. He show us a picture of
[16:19] the Garden of Eden. And there's so much
[16:20] information embedded in that picture
[16:22] that we still haven't extracted all the
[16:25] information that's in that picture. We
[16:27] just keep looking at it and it keeps
[16:29] coming alive more and more to us. And we
[16:31] know that that Eden was a reflection of
[16:33] heaven. And we know uh there's so many
[16:36] things. It was a reflection of God's
[16:37] desire. It was there's so much going on
[16:39] here in Eden. But the but the it's
[16:42] interesting that God planted a garden
[16:44] eastward in Eden. And eastward doesn't
[16:46] necessarily mean a location. So I I I I
[16:50] hope that we can stay together on this.
[16:51] It doesn't necessarily mean it was as
[16:53] far east as you could travel, but
[16:55] eastward always means to the beginning
[16:57] or origin. So early on from the
[16:59] beginning he planted a garden and that
[17:02] garden was an enclosure. Amen. And so
[17:05] the enclosure was always for
[17:07] protection. The enclosure is for safety
[17:10] and security. So God had a garden
[17:13] eastward in Eden. And there he put the
[17:16] man whom he had formed. All right, we're
[17:18] all on the same page. All right, let's
[17:20] keep moving. And in verse 15, he says,
[17:24] "And the Lord God took the man and put
[17:26] him into the garden of Eden to dress it
[17:28] and to keep it. And the Lord God
[17:30] commanded the man, saying, of every tree
[17:32] of the garden, thou mayest freely eat,
[17:34] but of the tree of the knowledge of the
[17:36] of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
[17:38] it, for in the day thou eatest thereof,
[17:40] thou shalt surely die." So this becomes
[17:43] a commandment to the man. And God is
[17:45] telling him that you may not partake of
[17:48] this tree. of all the trees you can, you
[17:49] cannot partake of this tree. And this is
[17:52] what brother Brandham says in going
[17:53] beyond the camp. Says how beautiful that
[17:56] is to the same camp that was in the
[17:59] Garden of Eden when God fortified his
[18:02] church in the Garden of Eden. His
[18:04] people, they had one wall to stay
[18:06] behind. That was the word. They had one
[18:09] shield, one armor, one thing because God
[18:11] knowed what would defeat the devil. And
[18:14] that's the word. Amen. So we we we know
[18:18] these things and we know also that 1
[18:20] Peter 5:8 says, "Be sober, be vigilant,
[18:23] because your adversary, the devil, is a
[18:25] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[18:28] he may devour." So we know that that
[18:31] this this devil is an adversary looking
[18:34] for who he can devour. And so God would
[18:37] provide for his children. Brother Bham
[18:38] explains all this. God would provide for
[18:40] his children the best protection that he
[18:42] could because he knew that there was a
[18:44] danger lurking out there. And so because
[18:46] there was a danger, God wanted to
[18:48] fortify and protect his children here in
[18:51] the garden. And and brother Bam even
[18:52] types it with his own son. If I knew
[18:54] there was a danger, a threat to my son
[18:56] Joseph's life, I would build a 40ft wall
[18:58] and I would have all of this uh uh
[19:00] reinforcement. I would protect them. And
[19:02] that's what God did for his children. He
[19:05] protected them with the greatest
[19:06] protection he could give them in the
[19:08] face of the adversary. And that
[19:10] protection was his word.
[19:13] Amen.
[19:15] So when we look at this garden as an
[19:18] enclosure in the wall in Eden, the wall
[19:21] in Eden may not necessarily be what we
[19:24] first imagined it to be. If I could say
[19:26] that the in the identified masterpiece
[19:30] of God, he says, now notice this one
[19:32] thing I want you to bear in mind that
[19:34] God gave his this man a protection.
[19:37] He gave him, he fortified him inside of
[19:40] his word because he told them what they
[19:42] could do and what they could not do. And
[19:44] that's the same basis we're set on
[19:46] today. What we can do and what we cannot
[19:49] do. No matter how good we are, how much
[19:51] we go to church or do this, we got to be
[19:53] born again. See, it must be. And God
[19:56] told Adam what he could do and what he
[19:58] could not do. He placed him behind his
[20:00] word. And then the enemy came in by
[20:03] deceit and crawled through the walls of
[20:06] God's word cuz the door was open to him
[20:09] and he marred that image to sin. That's
[20:12] one of the saddest stories. So God had
[20:15] them all fortified and walled off and
[20:17] separated and safe and secure. Amen. But
[20:20] the devil was lurking as a roaring lion
[20:23] seeing who could devour. Amen. And
[20:25] because of that, God had them walled off
[20:27] and protected. But the enemy, brother V
[20:29] says, "The enemy came in by deceit and
[20:32] crawled through the walls of God's word
[20:34] because the door was open to him." So,
[20:36] Brother Frank, if you could turn on the
[20:38] whiteboard for me, if we could switch to
[20:39] the whiteboard. And I would like to draw
[20:43] another picture.
[20:45] Thank
[20:47] God. I'm glad you all know me and love
[20:50] me. No matter what I do on this
[20:52] whiteboard, you'll still love me. Amen.
[20:56] So, if we think about if we think about
[20:59] the Garden of Eden and we realize that
[21:01] that many of the things God is showing
[21:03] us is symbols or are metaphors and
[21:06] they're symbolizing truth that God wants
[21:08] us to learn. And we find that here in in
[21:11] Eden, there was a a garden, the Garden
[21:16] of Eden. And garden means an enclosure.
[21:19] So there's an
[21:20] enclosure and and the garden is built
[21:24] for the enclosure is built to protect
[21:26] your garden. That's why it's there to
[21:28] keep you know in in in the natural world
[21:31] when you have a a a fence or a wall
[21:34] around your garden. It's to keep animals
[21:36] out. It's to keep things out that will
[21:38] defile the garden or rob you uh of the
[21:40] produce or do damage. And so the wall is
[21:43] there to protect the garden. But what's
[21:45] interesting in the scriptures is that in
[21:48] the midst of the
[21:49] garden were two trees,
[21:55] right? Amen.
[21:58] And one of these trees was the knowledge
[22:00] of good and
[22:01] evil. And so if the wall in Eden was a
[22:05] physical wall to keep them from danger,
[22:08] then why did God put the dangerous thing
[22:10] inside the wall?
[22:14] Amen.
[22:14] Right. And so that's why I said we've
[22:17] got to uh you know, Brother Brandham was
[22:19] so good at taking us beyond the symbol
[22:22] to the truth, beyond the metaphor to the
[22:24] lesson that God was trying to get us to
[22:26] teach. Because so many times we've we've
[22:28] heard things so many times, we
[22:29] automatically make things carnal. We
[22:31] automatically go to physical because
[22:32] that's the only thing we understand. We
[22:34] understand physical. You tell me wall
[22:36] and I'm going to see a wall. You tell me
[22:38] lampstand, I'm going to see a lampstand.
[22:40] You tell me any of these things and I'm
[22:41] going to actually see what I've seen
[22:43] that represented in this dimension.
[22:45] Amen. But God is using that symbol to
[22:47] teach a greater truth. Amen. So this
[22:50] wall uh this garden, this walled
[22:53] enclosure had the most dangerous thing
[22:55] to them inside in the midst which means
[22:59] middle of the garden.
[23:03] And there was something else that was in
[23:05] the garden.
[23:08] The serpent was in the garden. I'm not
[23:11] going to try to draw the
[23:13] serpent. You just use your own
[23:16] imagination. The serpent was in the
[23:18] garden. And that's not the only one that
[23:20] was in the garden because Satan was in
[23:22] the garden.
[23:25] Because the the Bible says in Ezekiel,
[23:28] "Thou hast been in Eden."
[23:33] And
[23:34] so it wasn't that this wall was this
[23:39] physical wall. Now don't get me wrong.
[23:41] If God put a wall around it, that
[23:42] doesn't bother me a bit. If there was
[23:44] actually a garden and God had put a
[23:46] wall, I I I have no problem with that.
[23:48] If we get to the other side and we look
[23:49] back through the scroll of history and I
[23:51] say, "I did have a wall around it." I'm
[23:52] not going to be disappointed.
[23:54] Amen. Amen. So So don't get me wrong.
[23:57] We're not saying there was or there
[23:58] wasn't. But the real lesson here, amen,
[24:01] is is the physical wall is not what kept
[24:04] them safe. Amen. It was the wall of
[24:06] God's word that was their safety.
[24:08] Because in the midst of the garden that
[24:10] God planted, there was two trees. One of
[24:12] life, one of the tree of knowledge of
[24:14] good and evil. And in that garden also,
[24:16] the serpent moved freely. And in that
[24:18] garden also, Amen. Satan had access.
[24:21] Because how did Satan get to the serpent
[24:25] if he wasn't able to access the garden?
[24:28] Yeah. So, so we're we're not looking at
[24:32] things physical and and something else
[24:34] that I would like to share with you. Oh
[24:37] my
[24:38] goodness, if I
[24:41] can. There's a quote from uh 1961. Jesus
[24:45] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[24:47] forever. But it's just representative of
[24:48] a statement brother Benham makes many,
[24:50] many times. He says, "And man was made
[24:53] to be a god." We know that Genesis 1:26,
[24:56] he had domain over the whole earth and
[24:59] he was made to be an amateur god. And so
[25:01] in many places all the way into the
[25:03] fourth seal, brother Brandham says that
[25:05] that that uh Adam was God of the whole
[25:08] earth. He was God of all creation. So
[25:12] Adam was not bound to this garden. Yeah.
[25:16] Adam was not walled in the garden. Yeah.
[25:19] So the wall of the garden was not a cage
[25:24] for Adam,
[25:26] right? These things are all very
[25:28] important to begin to understand. He
[25:30] wasn't hemmed in because he was God of
[25:34] the whole earth. He had dominion over
[25:36] the whole earth. He had domain and
[25:38] rulership over all of the creation.
[25:41] So he could go anywhere he wanted. Amen.
[25:44] He could move about wherever the
[25:46] creation was, wherever his domain was,
[25:48] wherever the earth was. So the wall of
[25:52] Eden was not a confinement to Adam.
[25:59] The wall of Eden was a barrier to the
[26:03] devil.
[26:05] It's become super important. It was a
[26:08] barrier to the enemy. It was not
[26:10] confinement to Adam. Adam was not
[26:13] confined or restricted by the wall that
[26:15] God gave him. Adam had freedom to move
[26:18] about over the earth. He had freedom to
[26:20] rule and to reign over the earth. He had
[26:22] freedom to speak. He had freedom uh to
[26:25] move trees. He had freedom to do uh uh
[26:27] as he felt to do as the as as he would
[26:30] do as a son of God, as a representation
[26:32] of God on the earth. Amen. So he was not
[26:34] bound or restricted by the wall. He was
[26:37] protected by the wall.
[26:39] So, this is so good for us to understand
[26:42] and start thinking of the word this way.
[26:44] Amen. Because we'll see what the the
[26:46] devil does here in just a minute. So,
[26:49] Brother Brandham said the enemy came in
[26:51] by deceit and crawled through the walls
[26:53] of God's word cuz the door was open to
[26:56] him. So, I don't know what imagery you
[26:58] get, but I mean, you can imagine here he
[27:01] is sneaking, you know, he's crawling
[27:03] through the hedge, you know, and he's
[27:04] pulling it back and he's slipping in.
[27:06] That's not how he got into Eden. And it
[27:08] wasn't that he scaled the wall and it
[27:10] and it wasn't that he slipped underneath
[27:11] the gate and he wiggled his way through
[27:13] and he got to the other side. That's not
[27:15] how he broke in to Eden. Amen. He came
[27:18] in by deceit.
[27:21] So he broke through the wall by deceit.
[27:23] And then the wall was open to him. Amen.
[27:26] And he could move in, amen, to where God
[27:29] had protected and fortified his
[27:31] children.
[27:32] Amen. Because everything in the Bible,
[27:36] Amen, operates the same way by the same
[27:38] principles. Amen. We see it from the
[27:40] beginning and it operates the same
[27:42] way.
[27:44] So if we could go back to the uh
[27:51] PowerPoint and in the in this
[27:53] PowerPoint, we go to the next slide.
[27:56] Genesis 3 1 says, "Now the serpent was
[27:59] more subtle than any beast of the field
[28:01] which the Lord God had made. And he said
[28:03] unto the woman, yay, hath God said, Ye
[28:06] shall not eat of every tree of the
[28:07] garden. And the woman said unto the
[28:09] serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the
[28:11] trees of the garden, but of the fruit of
[28:13] the tree which is in the midst of the
[28:15] garden. God has said, "You shall not eat
[28:17] of it, neither shall you touch it, lest
[28:19] you die." And the serpent said unto the
[28:22] woman, "You shall not surely die. For
[28:25] God does know that the day you eat
[28:26] thereof, then your eyes shall be open,
[28:28] and you shall be as gods, knowing good
[28:30] and evil. And when the woman saw that
[28:33] the tree was good for food, and it was
[28:35] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
[28:37] desired to make one wise, she took of
[28:39] the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave
[28:41] also unto her husband with her, and he
[28:44] did eat.
[28:46] The first thing that the devil does in
[28:48] his deception to get through the wall,
[28:52] remember brother Beam said God fortified
[28:54] his children behind the wall of his word
[28:56] and Satan couldn't get to them.
[28:59] Now Satan through the serpent could talk
[29:02] to Eve. Yeah. So it must have been in
[29:05] the garden, but he couldn't get to Eve.
[29:10] Right.
[29:11] He could speak to her and reason with
[29:14] her, but he could not get to her because
[29:16] she was behind the wall of the word. But
[29:18] the first thing that the devil does is
[29:21] he turns the wall of protection into a
[29:24] barrier for the children of God. So he
[29:28] turns it from his barrier to their
[29:31] barrier. Right. And the moment God the
[29:34] moment that the devil turns what God
[29:37] meant for protection and keep the devil
[29:39] at bay and he turned it around and made
[29:42] it a confinement for Eve, a barrier for
[29:44] her where she was limited in how far she
[29:47] could go and how far she could move.
[29:49] Amen. And then she began to look at the
[29:52] tree and she began to see, amen, things
[29:54] that she hadn't seen before. She began
[29:57] to see that it was good for food and it
[30:00] was pleasant to the eye. And it's
[30:01] amazing how in verse six it said, "And
[30:03] when the woman saw the tree, it was as
[30:05] if she never considered these things
[30:07] before."
[30:09] That's the the verbiage, the
[30:10] terminology. And it says, "And and when
[30:13] and when the woman saw the tree,
[30:15] obviously she had seen the tree before,
[30:17] but now she was looking at the tree in a
[30:19] different way. She was now beginning to
[30:21] analyze the tree. Amen. And now there
[30:24] was a longing building in her for the
[30:26] tree because now the commandment became
[30:29] a barrier to keep her away from
[30:32] something that she was now wanting.
[30:34] Yeah.
[30:36] And what was her force field? Yeah.
[30:40] Became her prison. Uhhuh. Right. In her
[30:43] mind. Amen. What was her protection? Her
[30:47] invisible barrier that kept her
[30:49] completely
[30:51] safe was now a prison cell. Yeah. Was
[30:56] now a
[30:57] limitation. Because the because the
[30:59] serpent says you're not going to surely
[31:01] die. God does
[31:03] know that if you eat this, you'll be as
[31:06] gods. Your eyes will be open. You'll be
[31:08] as God's. And all of a sudden, he
[31:10] painted the picture that God only told
[31:13] you this to keep you from something
[31:14] wonderful. Yeah.
[31:18] Oh my
[31:19] goodness. If I could get every teenager
[31:22] to understand this, there would be such
[31:25] freedom and liberty.
[31:30] And when the woman saw that the tree was
[31:33] good for food, why did she never
[31:34] consider the tree before? Why did she
[31:36] never reason about the tree before?
[31:38] Because there was a commandment.
[31:40] The commandment was simple. Don't eat of
[31:42] that tree. So there was no reason to
[31:45] reason about it. Think about it, look at
[31:47] it, dwell on it. Amen. But all of a
[31:49] sudden, the devil turned her attention
[31:51] to the to the thing that God said,
[31:53] "Don't have." And all of a sudden, she
[31:55] saw that is I am not allowed to have.
[32:02] I want you to understand something. God
[32:05] never said that she wasn't allowed to
[32:07] have.
[32:11] God never said she wasn't allowed to
[32:13] have. He just told him, "Don't do it."
[32:17] Because if you do it, this will be the
[32:18] result.
[32:21] But God, listen to how slick the devil
[32:24] is. The devil makes her feel
[32:27] underprivileged.
[32:29] So you will be like gods, knowing good
[32:32] and evil. They were already like gods.
[32:35] They were amateur gods. They had control
[32:38] and dominion over all the earth. They He
[32:40] was trying to offer them something they
[32:42] already had. Yeah.
[32:45] and then trying to tell them that that
[32:48] your eyes will be open and you'll know
[32:50] something you don't know now. And so
[32:52] he's trying to offer them a position
[32:53] that they don't need and trying to get
[32:55] them to see something as greater which
[32:57] God didn't want them to see because God
[32:59] knew that that greater vision was not
[33:01] good. It was bad.
[33:04] Because why did he want why would God
[33:06] want them to know good and evil? He
[33:08] designed Eden to be his pleasure. He
[33:10] designed for them to only know good.
[33:12] Yeah. He didn't want them to know good
[33:13] and evil. He only wanted them to know
[33:15] good. And so God set this up and gave
[33:18] them this one commandment so that they
[33:20] would always know good.
[33:22] But Satan made Satan made God's love and
[33:26] God's provision look like God's
[33:28] limitation and God holding back on them
[33:31] and then begin to build a lust in the
[33:33] woman, a desire for something that God
[33:36] was keeping from her. And you know how
[33:37] it is. As soon as you tell somebody
[33:39] they're not allowed to have something.
[33:40] It's the only thing in the world they
[33:41] want.
[33:43] They may never even wanted it before,
[33:44] but just as soon as you said they can't
[33:46] have it, then all of a sudden they start
[33:47] think, well, why can't I have it? And
[33:49] what's so good about it that I can't
[33:50] have it? And I
[33:53] human
[33:55] nature. And to to show how perfect God
[33:59] is is God actually never walled off his
[34:03] kids.
[34:05] He gave them a wall to stay behind, but
[34:08] he didn't wall them in. Because whenever
[34:11] they chose to, they could walk out from
[34:13] behind the wall whenever they decided
[34:16] they could open the door to the wall and
[34:18] let the devil in. So God never
[34:22] restricted his children by his word.
[34:26] The devil made it look like a
[34:28] restriction, but it was no restriction
[34:30] because God never took away free moral
[34:32] agency. God never prevented them from
[34:33] eating from it. God never said, "You're
[34:35] not allowed to eat from it." God just
[34:37] said, "Don't do it." Yeah. It'll hurt
[34:39] you. Yeah. Amen. But the devil made it
[34:43] look like it was the greatest barrier
[34:45] and it was a it was a prison sentence
[34:48] and it was a wall and it was God
[34:50] withholding
[34:51] something. Oh, praise be to God. I love
[34:54] the word of God. Absolutely love the
[34:57] word of God because the tactics of the
[34:58] devil has never changed.
[35:01] Never changed. are the exact same all
[35:03] the time. So God never put them in the
[35:05] garden and he never put a padlock on the
[35:07] on the gate and put a chain around it
[35:09] and said, "You're in there and you're
[35:11] safe. I've walled you off." No, his wall
[35:14] was a voluntary wall. You can
[35:16] voluntarily stay behind the protection I
[35:18] gave you or you can leave it.
[35:22] It's your choice. So there was no
[35:25] restriction in God. There was no barrier
[35:28] in God. There was only protection and
[35:31] love and instruction.
[35:34] But the devil won the battle when he
[35:36] twisted her mind to view the precious,
[35:38] loving word of God as something
[35:41] different than the precious, loving,
[35:43] protective word of God.
[35:46] Amen. He does the same thing to us.
[35:52] He says in grace battle over fought. The
[35:54] battle raged when Eve opened her mind to
[35:57] listen to her reasoning. That's the flu
[36:00] it come in. That's the channel it run
[36:03] down her reasoning. She and her soul,
[36:06] she reasoned. So, how did the devil get
[36:09] through this wall of Eden? It wasn't a
[36:11] jackhammer. It wasn't a bulldozer. It
[36:15] wasn't a shovel where he dug dug under
[36:17] the wall. How did he get through this
[36:19] barrier in Eden? He got through the
[36:21] woman's mind through reasoning.
[36:24] Hey, praise God. That's the same way he
[36:26] does it today. Amen. God has got a wall
[36:28] for his children to stay behind. And
[36:30] we've got just as strong a wall as they
[36:32] had in Eden. And that wall is just as
[36:35] able to prevent the devil from getting
[36:37] to us as the wall in Eden was. We have
[36:39] no less of a wall, no less powerful of a
[36:41] wall. In fact, we're so blessed that we
[36:43] live in a day that the full power of the
[36:45] word has been restored. We have a
[36:47] perfect wall. Yeah. Amen. But that wall
[36:50] has never fenced us in. Amen. When God
[36:53] never took us and put us in the wall and
[36:55] say, "Hey, you're not allowed to go
[36:56] anywhere. You're not allowed to leave
[36:58] this wall." No, it's a voluntary shield.
[37:01] It's a voluntary wall. God says, "I've
[37:03] restored the word. I've sent a prophet
[37:06] to tell you what is right and what is
[37:08] wrong and what to do and what not to do
[37:10] and what to avoid and what to step
[37:12] towards. And now I've put back I've
[37:14] restored the wall. I've brought back the
[37:16] wall like I had it in Eden. Now the
[37:18] choice is yours. Do you see the wall as
[37:20] a shield or do you see the wall as a
[37:22] trap?
[37:26] Amen.
[37:27] Cuz it's going to determine exactly how
[37:29] we react to the word. Right.
[37:34] Amen. So we've got a wall restored, but
[37:38] that wall does not limit. It's no limit
[37:42] to us.
[37:44] Did God take away free moral agency?
[37:47] Can you go do whatever you want right
[37:49] now? God has not he it's God has not
[37:53] prevented premortal agency. He has not
[37:55] violated the law of free moral agency.
[37:57] No matter how much the word's restored
[37:58] and how much the prophet cried out
[38:00] against sin, no matter how much the
[38:02] five-fold ministry cries out, no matter
[38:03] how much the the the word of Paul's been
[38:05] restored, no matter how much truth we
[38:07] have, God is still not placing a barrier
[38:10] around his children. They have absolute
[38:12] freedom like every other human being is
[38:14] to do whatever they desire to do.
[38:20] Amen. So that's why this message is
[38:24] never been captivity.
[38:28] It's always been liberty.
[38:31] It's always been liberty. It's been the
[38:34] liberty to keep us from captivity.
[38:38] God told the nation of Israel when he
[38:40] brought them into the promised land and
[38:41] he set them in, he gave them
[38:43] commandments and decrees and a law to
[38:45] keep. And he says, "If you keep my law,
[38:47] he said, I will be a wall to you.
[38:51] I will be a wall to you so that you
[38:53] won't need walls." Amen. They didn't
[38:55] have to build a wall all the way around
[38:57] the nation of Israel. He said, "I will
[38:59] be your wall to keep the enemy from
[39:01] coming in and taking you." Amen. God was
[39:04] their wall. And sometimes we look at
[39:05] commandments like that and we say,
[39:07] "Well, God said, if you do everything I
[39:09] tell you to do, then I'll be your wall
[39:11] and you didn't do what I said, so I'm
[39:14] done with you. I I'm going to I'm I'm
[39:17] going to take away your protection. I'm
[39:18] going to make sure you get
[39:20] destroyed." It can read like that. We
[39:22] can understand with a cardinal mind, but
[39:23] the reality is, Amen. The word was the
[39:27] wall. When they left the word, they left
[39:29] the wall. Right. When they stayed with
[39:32] the commandments of God, they he was
[39:34] their wall because he is the word. Amen.
[39:37] They left their own wall. They tore down
[39:40] their own wall. When they moved to idol
[39:42] worship and they and they began to set
[39:44] up leagues with the different nations
[39:46] around them and they began to adapt,
[39:48] amen, to the cultures that were around
[39:49] them, they were actually walking out
[39:52] from under the wall. They were actually
[39:53] tearing down their own wall that God
[39:55] gave them to protect them that he
[39:57] ensured would become a barrier between
[39:59] them and all of their enemies.
[40:02] Amen. The inevitable in tearing down
[40:05] your protective wall is that enemies
[40:07] will come in.
[40:09] And the enemies came in and destroyed
[40:11] Israel and took them captive. Amen.
[40:14] Listen, that was that was not just uh uh
[40:17] punitive. That was not just God bringing
[40:19] about a punishment. Of course, God
[40:21] allowed it. Of course, God permitted it.
[40:23] Of course, God, even Nebuchadnezzar was
[40:25] even his servant. Amen. But it was
[40:27] according to the word. They had no more
[40:30] wall of protection,
[40:33] cuz they left the word.
[40:39] So the channel through the
[40:44] wall is that flu of reasoning in the
[40:49] mind. That little tunnel that he comes
[40:52] in to get through the wall of protection
[40:54] which is the word is the reasoning in
[40:58] the
[41:00] mind. It's why the greatest battle ever
[41:02] fought is where? Fought in the mind.
[41:05] Amen.
[41:09] Listen, if we stay with the word as God
[41:12] has restored the word to us through a
[41:14] prophet and if we just stay behind that
[41:18] word, listen, you've got a force field
[41:21] around your mind. Amen.
[41:24] You've got you've got a mind, amen, that
[41:27] is guarded against lies and deceit and
[41:31] tricks of the devil. Hallelujah. And
[41:34] it's not because you know more. It's not
[41:36] that kind of a thing. It's not because
[41:38] I've got so much knowledge now. It's
[41:40] it's it's not like that. It's it's the
[41:42] fact that God said this. You're my mind
[41:46] is saying this. I'll reject this and
[41:48] take this.
[41:50] It's not superior intelligence. It's not
[41:52] superior knowledge. It's just the fact
[41:54] that God Amen. in his Bible says this.
[41:57] God through his prophet said this. So
[41:59] I'll take this and reject anything
[42:00] that's different than this. Amen. Not
[42:02] because I understand it. Not because it
[42:05] makes sense to my mind. Amen. Because
[42:07] it's not superior intelligence. It's not
[42:09] better knowledge. Sometimes we don't
[42:11] even understand why.
[42:14] Praise God. Sometimes it takes years to
[42:16] even understand the why behind why
[42:18] brother Ben why brother Ben railed on
[42:20] this and why brother Ben harped on this.
[42:22] I mean, Brother Benham was back in the
[42:23] 50s and he was railing on Amen. the the
[42:26] change in gender roles.
[42:29] And he was harping on women going to
[42:31] work and women in the police force and
[42:33] women being deacons and women in the
[42:35] pull pit and women taking the place of a
[42:37] man and women wearing men's garments and
[42:39] women cutting off their hair. And he was
[42:41] just railing on it over and over and
[42:44] over again. And if you don't think it
[42:46] was a major theme in Brother Benham's
[42:47] ministry, then I invite you to go
[42:49] listen.
[42:50] Amen. Just listen. Just pick out five
[42:53] sermons and tell me if it doesn't show
[42:54] up in there. Right? It's a major major
[42:58] part. And he's railing on the women
[43:00] getting out of their place. And he makes
[43:02] statements like when a woman gets out of
[43:04] the kitchen, she's out of her place. A
[43:05] woman doesn't know what side of the
[43:07] house she belongs on. You understand
[43:09] these in modern language, these are
[43:11] offensive statements. And I just want to
[43:14] go on the record, I'm not offended by
[43:15] them. Amen. I'm not offended by them
[43:19] because what that prophet knew, Amen, is
[43:21] is those gender roles are God being
[43:24] expressed and fe feminines and masculine
[43:26] and God wants masculine and God wants
[43:28] feminist and God made a distinct
[43:30] separation. He wants them to dress
[43:32] separate. He wants them to act separate
[43:34] and he wants them to fulfill separate
[43:35] roles in his economy because both of
[43:37] them are expressing his nature. And when
[43:40] you begin to blend them and mix them,
[43:42] you tear down and pervert the very
[43:44] nature of God. and brother Bam was
[43:46] railing on it in the 50s. Now we fast
[43:48] forward to 2025 and we understand
[43:50] exactly why he was nailing that word
[43:53] down and saying this is wrong. This is
[43:55] wrong. Because in the day that he was
[43:56] railing on it and it wasn't that bad.
[44:01] I mean that's a reasoning statement.
[44:04] When I say that that's human reasoning
[44:07] because it was bad. The slightest
[44:09] deviation from God's plan is horrible.
[44:11] Yeah. The slightest deviation from what
[44:14] God desires, what God wants, what God
[44:16] designed is evil. Amen. So, it was
[44:19] horrible. But in our mind, here we are,
[44:22] what, 60, 70 years later, we're we're
[44:24] looking at that and saying it really
[44:26] wasn't that bad. But it was that bad
[44:30] because as soon as they tore down that
[44:32] wall of protection for the home, for the
[44:34] family, for the woman, for the man, look
[44:36] at what swept in. And now we've been
[44:38] taken over by demon spirits. Amen.
[44:40] taking over minds of of of adolesccents
[44:42] and teenagers and young children,
[44:44] perverting them so much they don't know
[44:46] what gender they are. Amen. They don't
[44:48] understand what it is to be human
[44:50] anymore. They don't understand what it
[44:51] is to be biologically male or
[44:54] biologically female. Amen. What is
[44:57] wrong? Where's the protection gone? The
[44:59] protection never came from the
[45:00] government. The protection never came
[45:02] from education. The protection came from
[45:04] the word of God. And when the word of
[45:06] God was violated by reasoning,
[45:09] what is the reasoning? Well, a woman can
[45:11] do that job just as good as a man.
[45:15] And that is true.
[45:19] That can be a true statement. I don't
[45:22] mean across the board true. Yeah.
[45:24] Because there's some things that are
[45:26] just physically Amen. easier for a man
[45:29] than a woman. But a woman is as
[45:31] intelligent,
[45:33] as learned, as capable, as witty, as
[45:36] inventive,
[45:37] as a man.
[45:39] So when you go to the flu of reasoning,
[45:43] then the devil breaks down the wall of
[45:46] protection that God had for humanity,
[45:50] for human beings. Yes,
[45:59] it civilizations are beginning to
[46:02] collapse
[46:03] because people aren't having children.
[46:06] As simple as not getting married and
[46:08] having children is causing systems to
[46:10] come onto the brink of collapse, right?
[46:16] And you think that's just a minor thing.
[46:18] No, that's a major thing.
[46:21] Yes. Yeah. Because people have left
[46:24] God's plan. They've left God's word.
[46:27] They've left gender. Something as simple
[46:30] as gender roles. Yeah. Right. The way
[46:33] God wants them to
[46:34] be. And then when this new psychology
[46:38] comes down and reasoning and and
[46:40] reasoning affects the mind and and he
[46:42] gets through the word and tears it down
[46:43] and all of a sudden you have
[46:44] generations, you have decades now of
[46:46] this reasoning. Now it becomes offensive
[46:49] to say anything that's actually true.
[46:51] Yeah.
[46:55] What happened was there was reasoning
[46:57] that came along way back at the turn of
[47:00] the century. And that reasoning was to
[47:04] the woman, you're being prevented
[47:08] right from your full potential.
[47:12] You're being held back. Yep. Yeah.
[47:15] You're being discriminated against
[47:17] because you don't have the right to
[47:19] vote. Yeah. Because you can't wear pants
[47:22] in public,
[47:24] because you have to keep a certain
[47:26] standard, certain etiquette, and a
[47:27] certain role in the home. You're being
[47:30] held back.
[47:33] That was the reasoning.
[47:35] And you get some educated women who
[47:38] prove that they are as smart are smarter
[47:41] than their colleagues and the reasoning
[47:44] looks reasonable
[47:47] because reasoning is reasonable to the
[47:49] human mind. Yeah. And then here we are.
[47:54] You take just this however many decades
[47:57] it's been since the women's liberation
[47:59] movement and you come into the disaster
[48:01] that we have in society. Right. to where
[48:06] people who have no understanding of the
[48:08] scriptures are recognizing this is a
[48:10] disaster.
[48:12] They don't even know what the word says
[48:13] about it and they recognize that it's a
[48:15] disaster. What happened? Reasoning broke
[48:19] through the wall that was
[48:21] protecting not just Christians, human
[48:24] beings.
[48:28] So yeah, praise God. Amen.
[48:34] So the
[48:35] word that protected and God's design for
[48:39] a woman that protected the feminine
[48:41] nature of a woman and preserved it as
[48:43] feminine. Amen. and and kept it dainty
[48:48] and feminine and
[48:50] softer and kept it like uh Peter said
[48:53] the weaker vessel
[48:56] because that can be an offensive term
[48:58] now the weaker vessel but that's
[49:01] scripture
[49:03] that's the Bible
[49:05] so that shouldn't be anything of shame
[49:07] that shouldn't be anything that degrades
[49:09] or the weaker vessel that word weaker
[49:13] means precious or valuable are are
[49:15] easily broken. Like something fragile.
[49:18] You could use the word fragile in place
[49:20] of
[49:20] weaker. But now the woman can't be
[49:23] fragile anymore. She's got to be tough
[49:24] cuz she's got to put on her boots and go
[49:26] to work every day.
[49:29] She can't cry.
[49:33] She She's come to a place where the
[49:35] woman has to be a big boy
[49:39] and provide for her family, make the car
[49:41] payment, make the house payment.
[49:44] But that was never God's design for the
[49:46] feminine spirit. She's lost part of her
[49:49] identity. She's lost something that
[49:50] makes her who she is.
[49:53] Because we've left the word.
[49:57] Amen. That was not part of my sermon.
[49:59] Praise God. But it's part of God's
[50:01] apparently.
[50:03] But we can see that such a clear and
[50:05] stark example. But it works in
[50:07] everything in the word of God the same
[50:09] way. It's all the same. They turned they
[50:13] turned what God meant for protection to
[50:15] preserve the feminine spirit and make
[50:18] sure she was protected. You know the
[50:20] law, if you go back to the Old Testament
[50:22] law, you go back to the Levitical law,
[50:24] God wrote in the Levitical law and in
[50:27] the law, God always protected the woman
[50:30] against the abuses of a man.
[50:33] Always. It's riddled through the Bible.
[50:35] And if you think the Old Testament,
[50:36] Amen, is men dominating and and it is
[50:39] paternal.
[50:41] It is men dominating.
[50:43] But men were dominating for protection
[50:45] and for Amen. They were the wall for
[50:48] their wives. They were the protection of
[50:49] the woman. They had to care for her.
[50:51] They had to shelter. They had to protect
[50:53] her. And if they violated their role
[50:55] that God gave them in the protection of
[50:56] the female. Amen. The law was there to
[50:59] bring them back in line to their role as
[51:01] a protector and a preserver of the
[51:03] female. Yeah. Amen. But that protection,
[51:08] that word that protected and preserved
[51:10] and allowed her to stay female, fragile,
[51:13] sensitive, amen, sweet, and and that
[51:16] allowed her to stay all the things God
[51:17] wanted her to be. She by reasoning start
[51:20] to saw that as a prison cell and a gate
[51:23] that was locked to prevent her from
[51:24] being all that she wanted to be. And all
[51:26] of a sudden, the devil had to tell her,
[51:28] "It's better on the other side of this
[51:30] wall. Look what men get to do. Look what
[51:31] men get to decide. Look what they Yeah.
[51:34] Right.
[51:35] I tell you from the man's perspective.
[51:40] Amen. Sometimes I wish somebody else was
[51:42] in charge and I didn't have the
[51:44] responsibility and I didn't have to make
[51:46] the decisions. And I don't want to be a
[51:49] woman. I don't want to violate my roles.
[51:50] But sometimes I look and said, "It would
[51:52] just be nice to defer everything up. Ask
[51:55] my husband. Ask your dad. Wait till my
[51:58] husband gets home.
[52:00] Oh boy, I would love that.
[52:04] Grass is not always greener on the other
[52:07] side. And I guess guys who think it'd be
[52:09] great to be a woman, we we probably
[52:11] should go through child birth once or
[52:13] twice. And we might realize God's equal
[52:15] to everything. Amen. Everything's fair
[52:17] in the kingdom of
[52:19] God. But you realize she no longer saw
[52:23] the protection of God. She saw the
[52:25] limitation,
[52:27] the barrier, the comp. She was
[52:30] confined and then she wanted to break
[52:32] out of the confinement. But to break out
[52:35] of the confinement, she had to open the
[52:37] door to the word and allow the devil to
[52:40] come in and change the very roles uses
[52:44] of a
[52:45] woman. Amen. You think about something
[52:48] that's so fundamental to humanity can
[52:50] become so perverted and violated because
[52:53] we left the word.
[52:55] It makes me want to give up all
[52:58] reasoning and just say, "God, whatever
[52:59] your word says is all I want. Help me
[53:02] reject every other thought I got that's
[53:04] against this word." Amen. And no matter
[53:06] whether I understand it or I don't
[53:08] understand it, it doesn't matter whether
[53:10] I understand it. Eve didn't understand
[53:12] it. God didn't want her to understand
[53:13] it. He just wanted her to be safe,
[53:16] protected, and stay. She was in Eden.
[53:20] She was in pleasure. She was guarded and
[53:23] protected. She had
[53:25] everything and she lost it all trying to
[53:27] step beyond what she saw as a barrier.
[53:31] God help us. In the identifying
[53:34] masterpiece, the prophet says to think
[53:36] that man that was made in the image of
[53:38] his creator and was given a wall to
[53:40] stand behind and that and that word
[53:43] could never fail.
[53:47] We're listen, we're not in the situation
[53:49] we're in now by just odd circumstances.
[53:54] Everything that you see the world
[53:56] struggling with today is because
[53:58] somewhere the word was left behind.
[54:01] Everything, every war, all the whatever
[54:05] crisis, sickness, whatever you see,
[54:07] whatever is going on in the world,
[54:08] whatever social issues are, whatever
[54:10] government problems there are,
[54:12] everything is related back to this same
[54:15] thing is somewhere along the line, they
[54:17] let down the bar on the word. Amen. And
[54:19] then the devil swept in and perversion
[54:21] came and it ruined everything that God
[54:23] was intending to
[54:25] protect. So the commandment of God was
[54:28] never a barrier for the children of God.
[54:30] It was always our
[54:32] freedom. The the word of God has never
[54:36] been a chain
[54:39] to limit your movement, to limit your
[54:41] liberty, to limit you from doing and
[54:44] going and being all that he called you
[54:46] to be.
[54:48] The word of God was to keep you from
[54:50] getting chains put on you.
[54:58] Praise God. Amen. Amen.
[55:03] As soon as Eve and Adam crossed the line
[55:07] of God's word, here come a big old ball
[55:10] and chain clamp around their leg. She
[55:14] wanted freedom and she was offered a bit
[55:16] of freedom and a little more liberty, a
[55:20] little more knowledge, a little more
[55:22] pleasure. And what does she get? Death
[55:24] and destruction and heartache. Amen.
[55:27] Right. They never had to know what death
[55:29] was. They never had to know what a
[55:31] weakening body was. They never had to
[55:33] know what sickness was. And now she
[55:35] would grieve over the loss of Abel. They
[55:37] had no clue what death was. But they
[55:38] would experience death. Yeah. She didn't
[55:41] know what was pain was. But in
[55:42] childbearing, she would bring forth in
[55:44] pain and sorrow. She had no idea what
[55:46] pain was. Can you imagine how traumatic
[55:48] these first experiences were?
[55:51] Immediately she went from bliss and
[55:54] freedom and and and everything she could
[55:56] ever want and perfection. She didn't
[55:58] know what perfection was because she
[56:00] lived in perfection. She couldn't define
[56:02] perfection because everything was
[56:04] perfection. She didn't know what freedom
[56:06] was. That word meant nothing to her
[56:08] because the only thing she'd ever
[56:09] experienced was freedom. Liberty,
[56:12] freedom, peace, joy. She had all of it
[56:14] and had nothing different than that. She
[56:16] had it to its maximum level and she lost
[56:19] all of it in measure because she wanted
[56:21] a little more.
[56:25] Praise God. Help us, God. And they walk
[56:28] out of the Garden Eden with a a ball and
[56:30] chain strapped to them. And now they're
[56:31] in absolute bondage
[56:35] because of the freedom that Satan
[56:36] offered
[56:38] because they left the word.
[56:41] And Satan's in. He says, "Now Satan,
[56:43] this deceiver, as spoke of in Matthew
[56:45] 24:25, with so much deceit, now we find
[56:49] that by his gospel programs of
[56:51] knowledge, better education, higher
[56:53] ethics, civilization, and so forth has
[56:55] bewitched the people that wants to serve
[56:57] God into believing his lie." Eve did not
[57:01] want to do that, but he showed her how
[57:03] it was more wisdom in it. She didn't
[57:05] know, she wanted to know, she didn't
[57:07] understand, but she wanted to
[57:09] understand. And God told her not to try
[57:11] to understand. And that was what tripped
[57:14] her up. There was something she
[57:17] wanted. Again, in Satan's, he says,
[57:19] "Now, hatred and death and eternal
[57:21] separation from God in this Eden, lust,
[57:23] filth, perversion by sewing the wrong
[57:26] seed reminds me of the vision I seen
[57:28] before I ever met the Pentecostal people
[57:30] of that man going around the world in
[57:32] white. You've heard me tell it many
[57:34] times. And one came in behind him sewing
[57:36] seeds of discord. But he won it fairly
[57:39] in e in the garden of Eden by the lust
[57:41] of Eve for sin. The lust for Eve of sin.
[57:45] Then if Eve lusted for knowledge, it was
[57:47] a
[57:49] sin. When Eve wanted to experience
[57:52] something beyond the word, that was sin.
[57:58] Because she had to disbelieve the word
[58:00] and the reason the word was given to go
[58:02] beyond the word.
[58:04] She had to believe the devil's lie that
[58:08] there was some sort of uh uh something
[58:11] being withheld. There was something more
[58:12] that she could have, something more that
[58:14] she could experience. And the reality is
[58:16] there was some truth to that. Their eyes
[58:18] were open. They did know good and evil.
[58:23] And I guarantee they didn't like the
[58:24] evil that they now saw for the first
[58:26] time.
[58:28] What the devil offered them was so
[58:29] enticing because they didn't know what
[58:31] it was. It was something else. something
[58:33] I've never experienced, something I'd
[58:34] like to experience. I want to know. And
[58:36] all of a sudden, the the desire, the
[58:37] lust for knowledge began to build. She
[58:39] wanted to know what was behind this
[58:41] barrier, what was behind this wall that
[58:43] now to her became negative.
[58:47] And as soon as she stepped beyond the
[58:49] wall, all of a sudden she realized, I
[58:51] didn't want to know what evil was. Oh,
[58:54] if I could go back to only knowing what
[58:56] good was. Amen. How many of us wish we
[58:58] had no idea what evil was? If we would
[59:00] have just stayed true to the
[59:02] commandments, if we would have just
[59:03] obeyed our parents, as simple as just
[59:06] doing what the scripture says, honor thy
[59:08] father and thy mother, obey the your
[59:10] parents, amen, as unto the Lord. If we
[59:12] would have just kept that simple
[59:13] scripture all through our our teenage
[59:15] life and our growing up life. How many
[59:17] scars would be spared now? But there's
[59:19] so many things we now know as evil
[59:21] because I didn't do the simple scripture
[59:23] of honoring mother and father, right?
[59:25] Amen. Because I saw mother and father as
[59:27] a barrier to pleasure, as a barrier to
[59:30] freedom. And I saw mom and dad as a cage
[59:32] about me. And I saw their rules as a
[59:34] limitation to my freedom and my
[59:36] understanding and my knowledge. Amen.
[59:38] And no doubt there's been cages in the
[59:40] past. But amen, the principle of God
[59:42] stands true. Amen. That God gives godly
[59:44] parents because godly parents have more
[59:46] wisdom and understand what good and evil
[59:48] is all about. And so they tell their
[59:51] children, "You're not allowed to do this
[59:53] and you're not allowed to do that."
[59:54] Amen. And as they grow older, they
[59:56] change those boundaries, but they still
[59:58] give them the wisdom of knowing.
[1:00:03] But when the young people, listen to me,
[1:00:05] all of you who are young, as soon as the
[1:00:08] devil starts to get whispering in your
[1:00:10] mind, they don't want you to have fun,
[1:00:14] right? They don't want me to experience
[1:00:18] this. They don't want me. They They
[1:00:20] don't understand. They don't know.
[1:00:22] Listen, they may understand a whole lot
[1:00:24] more than you know than you realize.
[1:00:26] They might may they may understand
[1:00:28] exactly what's behind curtain number two
[1:00:33] because they went beyond curtain number
[1:00:34] two before and they saw the good and the
[1:00:37] evil.
[1:00:39] If we would just do the simplest of the
[1:00:41] simple things, we would have been spared
[1:00:43] so much
[1:00:45] trouble.
[1:00:47] If we would just stay with what the
[1:00:48] prophet taught
[1:00:51] and not reason with it,
[1:00:54] it would just be so much easier.
[1:00:59] James 1:27 says this, "Pure religion and
[1:01:03] undefiled before God and the father is
[1:01:05] this, to visit the fatherless and widows
[1:01:08] in their affliction, and to keep himself
[1:01:10] unspotted from the world."
[1:01:12] So this is true religion to keep
[1:01:15] ourselves unspotted from the world. This
[1:01:18] is so interesting. I started asking
[1:01:20] myself what is the
[1:01:22] world? What is the world? Because if I
[1:01:25] need to true religion is to keep myself
[1:01:27] unspotted from the world. What is the
[1:01:29] world? Because you know uh growing up
[1:01:32] and so many times I start thinking of
[1:01:34] the world as things out there. Out
[1:01:37] there's the world, right? The world's
[1:01:39] out there. Hey, listen. You can be in
[1:01:42] the world right now where you sit.
[1:01:45] You're in church, but you could be in
[1:01:46] the world. So, don't put the world out
[1:01:50] and and and and black dark places and
[1:01:53] and and extreme this and places you
[1:01:56] would never go and darken the door of
[1:01:57] these establishments and these places.
[1:01:59] That's not the world. Amen. That that
[1:02:02] that's that's part of the world. But
[1:02:04] then I wanted to look at the scripture
[1:02:05] and see in 1 John 2:15 says, "Love not
[1:02:08] the world, neither the things that are
[1:02:10] in the world. If any man love the world,
[1:02:13] the love of the father is not in him.
[1:02:14] For all that is in the world, the lust
[1:02:17] of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
[1:02:20] the pride of life is not of the father,
[1:02:22] but is of the world." So what is all
[1:02:25] that's in the world? Lust of the eyes,
[1:02:28] lust of the flesh, pride of life. Amen.
[1:02:32] That's why you don't have to go to a bar
[1:02:34] to be in the world. You don't have to go
[1:02:36] to whatever place we're not supposed to
[1:02:38] go to to be in the world. You can be in
[1:02:40] the world sitting in your living room.
[1:02:42] You can be in the world sitting in this
[1:02:44] church.
[1:02:46] Because if you're caught up in the lust
[1:02:48] of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and
[1:02:49] pride of life, Amen. You have the world
[1:02:52] in you now. Amen. That is what happened
[1:02:55] to Eve. She got caught up in those
[1:02:57] things. Amen. in the world. Amen. Became
[1:02:59] appealing to her and she entered the
[1:03:02] world, but she was still in the Garden
[1:03:04] of Eden.
[1:03:05] She didn't have to leave the Garden of
[1:03:07] Eden to go into the world. She went into
[1:03:10] the world in the Garden of Eden. Yeah.
[1:03:12] You don't have to leave church. You
[1:03:14] don't have to leave your home. You don't
[1:03:15] have to leave your family to go to the
[1:03:16] world.
[1:03:18] You can go to the world in your mind.
[1:03:20] You can go to the world in your private
[1:03:22] time. You can go to the world
[1:03:25] because you give over to these lusts.
[1:03:28] James 1:14 says, "But every man is
[1:03:31] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:03:33] lust and enticed. And when lust hath
[1:03:35] conceived, it bringeth forth sin. And
[1:03:37] sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth
[1:03:39] death." So this is the cycle of sin. It
[1:03:42] starts with lust. And what lust? Your
[1:03:45] own lust. Something in you that starts
[1:03:48] to crave, desire something. And this
[1:03:51] word lust means desire, craving,
[1:03:53] longing, desire for what is forbidden.
[1:03:55] Lust. So this lust is not when we say
[1:03:58] lust, we immediately associated with
[1:04:00] things that are sexual or sensual. But
[1:04:01] that's not lust. Lust is anything you're
[1:04:03] longing for or craving for, right? I
[1:04:08] mean, you your pride can have you
[1:04:09] craving and longing for a position or
[1:04:12] status or accolades among men, and
[1:04:13] that's the world,
[1:04:15] and it'll lead you the wrong way. You
[1:04:18] can be lusting for uh uh sexual
[1:04:20] pleasure. You can be lusting for other
[1:04:22] physical pleasures. You can be lusting
[1:04:24] for satisfaction in another way. And
[1:04:26] that's the world.
[1:04:30] So we can be in the world without
[1:04:33] changing locations.
[1:04:37] And the wall in Eden was penetrated.
[1:04:41] And I don't think anything physical was
[1:04:44] tore down. Yeah. I don't think a stone
[1:04:46] was toppled. Yeah. I don't think a
[1:04:48] padlock was cut. I don't think a hedge
[1:04:51] was chainsaw.
[1:04:53] But the wall was penetrated.
[1:04:59] Amen.
[1:05:02] Praise God.
[1:05:05] John
[1:05:07] 8:31 says, "Then said Jesus to those
[1:05:09] Jews which believed on on him, if you
[1:05:13] continue in my word, then you are my
[1:05:16] disciples indeed, and you shall know the
[1:05:19] truth, and the truth shall make you
[1:05:20] free." Amen. What's been restored in our
[1:05:24] day? Amen. The truth. What did the truth
[1:05:26] come? To make us free.
[1:05:30] They answered him, "We be Abraham's seed
[1:05:32] and were never in bondage to any man.
[1:05:35] How sayest thou, you shall be made
[1:05:37] free?" They were going back to physical
[1:05:39] bondage.
[1:05:41] And he says, Jesus answered them,
[1:05:43] "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:05:45] whosoever committh sin is the servant of
[1:05:48] sin." Now Jesus brings it right back to
[1:05:51] internal bondage.
[1:05:53] Not a physical handcuffs, not a physical
[1:05:56] army marching in and hauling you away
[1:05:58] and putting you in a prison camp
[1:06:00] somewhere. No, this bondage that he's
[1:06:02] talking about is a spiritual bondage
[1:06:04] that takes place inside of you.
[1:06:07] But he says, "I come that you shall know
[1:06:09] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:06:11] free so that you can't be brought into
[1:06:14] bondage that you won't be chained down
[1:06:17] inside your soul that you'll stay free."
[1:06:21] So the truth shall make us free. Turn
[1:06:25] with me to Matthew if you
[1:06:29] could. Matthew chapter
[1:06:43] 4 and then Matthew chapter 4. Let's go
[1:06:47] to verse one.
[1:06:50] Matthew
[1:06:51] 4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[1:06:54] into the wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:06:56] devil. And when he had fasted 40 days
[1:06:58] and 40 nights, he was afterward
[1:07:00] hungered. And when the tempter came to
[1:07:03] him, he said, "If thou be a son of God,
[1:07:05] command these stones to be made bread."
[1:07:07] But he answered and said, "It is
[1:07:09] written, man shall not live by bread
[1:07:11] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:07:13] out of the mouth of God."
[1:07:15] See, the devil begins by tempting him
[1:07:18] physically because Jesus had fasted 40
[1:07:21] days and he was
[1:07:22] hungered. So, this is a reasonable
[1:07:25] request. If you're a son of God, just
[1:07:26] make this bread. You've got dominion
[1:07:28] like Adam had dominion. Just feed
[1:07:29] yourself. There's nothing wrong with
[1:07:31] eating
[1:07:33] bread. And he starts to he starts to try
[1:07:36] to move uh Jesus into his own plan. And
[1:07:39] he starts to work on his desires. lust
[1:07:42] of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of
[1:07:44] life, the same thing that Eve fell by.
[1:07:47] Remember said he overcame it here in the
[1:07:49] wilderness. Those three things said then
[1:07:51] the devil taketh him up into the holy
[1:07:52] city and setth him on the pinnacle of a
[1:07:54] temple and saith unto him, if thou be
[1:07:56] the son of God, cast thyself down, for
[1:07:58] it is written, he shall give his angels
[1:08:00] charge concerning thee, and in their
[1:08:02] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at
[1:08:05] any time thou shalt dash thy foot
[1:08:06] against the stone. Jesus said unto him,
[1:08:09] it is written again, thou shalt not
[1:08:11] tempt the Lord thy
[1:08:12] God. Verse 8, again the devil taketh him
[1:08:15] up into an exceeding high mountain, and
[1:08:17] showed him all the kingdoms of the
[1:08:18] world, and all the glory of them, and
[1:08:20] saith unto him, All these things will I
[1:08:23] give thee, if thou wilt fall down, and
[1:08:25] worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him,
[1:08:28] Get thee hence, Satan, for it is
[1:08:30] written, Thou shalt not worship. Thou
[1:08:32] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
[1:08:34] only shalt thou serve. Then the devil
[1:08:37] leaveth him, and behold, angels came and
[1:08:40] ministered unto him. Here Jesus is led
[1:08:43] of the Holy Ghost, amen, into the
[1:08:45] wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
[1:08:46] And he's got to face down the same three
[1:08:48] temptations that Eve saw that Eve faced.
[1:08:52] It was good for food, pleasant to the
[1:08:54] eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
[1:08:56] one wise. Lust of the flesh, lust of the
[1:08:57] eyes, pride of life. Jesus comes into
[1:08:59] the same thing. And where Eve failed,
[1:09:02] Eve failed by reasoning.
[1:09:06] She failed by considering what the devil
[1:09:08] said and now looking at the object he
[1:09:11] was pointing to and started to consider
[1:09:13] this object and try to determine whether
[1:09:15] this thing was actually good or bad or
[1:09:17] not by her own intellect and she
[1:09:20] couldn't see where anything was wrong
[1:09:21] with it. So she moved forward. Jesus
[1:09:24] never does that. He never starts to get
[1:09:26] into an intellectual debate. He never
[1:09:27] starts to reason. As soon as the as soon
[1:09:29] as the devil comes and baits him, he
[1:09:31] comes back with another scripture and
[1:09:32] stays behind the wall. Yeah. Amen. He
[1:09:35] doesn't enter reasoning. He doesn't
[1:09:36] enter dialogue. He doesn't say, "Well, I
[1:09:38] feel and I think and and maybe." No, he
[1:09:40] just he gives him another scripture and
[1:09:42] stays behind the wall. And after three
[1:09:45] attempts, amen, three times he gives him
[1:09:47] the word. He stays behind the wall. And
[1:09:49] behind the wall, the devil cannot
[1:09:51] penetrate the wall of the word. He can
[1:09:54] only get through the flu of reasoning of
[1:09:55] the mind. And when Jesus doesn't go to
[1:09:58] reasoning and he doesn't go to debate,
[1:09:59] he just stays behind the word. The devil
[1:10:02] leaves him.
[1:10:04] The devil fled from him because he
[1:10:07] couldn't get through that wall.
[1:10:09] Now Jesus was Jesus behind the wall. Oh,
[1:10:13] praise God. Where was Jesus? He was led
[1:10:16] of the Holy Ghost into the wilderness to
[1:10:17] be tempted by the devil. What is the
[1:10:19] wilderness? He goes into vulnerability
[1:10:22] and isolation with no help, no church,
[1:10:24] no building, no temple, no priesthood.
[1:10:27] He's all alone. He's in the wilderness.
[1:10:29] He doesn't have a house. He doesn't have
[1:10:30] a building. He has absolutely no
[1:10:32] protection. and no defense. And the the
[1:10:35] Holy Ghost leads him to the weakest
[1:10:37] place that he could lead him.
[1:10:40] 40 days
[1:10:42] fasting and he's hungry.
[1:10:46] This temptation was not a mild
[1:10:48] temptation.
[1:10:50] Why don't you just get some bread? Well,
[1:10:51] if I just got up from dinner and the
[1:10:53] devil says, "Won't you speak bread into
[1:10:54] existence?" I say, "No, I'm not
[1:10:55] interested. God didn't tell me to." But
[1:10:58] if I fasted 40 days and 40 nights and
[1:11:00] afterwards I'm hungered after a 40-day
[1:11:03] fast, that's a different temptation
[1:11:05] altogether.
[1:11:08] The Holy Ghost leads him into the
[1:11:11] wilderness. He's got no support
[1:11:14] system, no friends, no mom, no dad, no
[1:11:19] priesthood, no temple.
[1:11:22] All he has is the word.
[1:11:25] And the word is enough.
[1:11:28] Amen. God did that to Jesus for you and
[1:11:30] I. Amen. There's not a place that we
[1:11:34] can't go and be protected by this word
[1:11:36] if we stay behind the word.
[1:11:39] Now, don't misunderstand me. There's
[1:11:40] places you shouldn't go because the word
[1:11:42] tells you not to. You can't stay behind
[1:11:44] the word and go to certain places.
[1:11:46] Brother Franco, if you could go back to
[1:11:48] the whiteboard for just a
[1:11:50] moment. We're going to go back to the
[1:11:52] whiteboard here and let's go to another
[1:11:55] picture.
[1:11:58] that the Bible says
[1:12:02] uh I'm not praying to take you out of
[1:12:04] the
[1:12:05] world but that my father will keep you
[1:12:07] from the evil. Jesus when he prayed for
[1:12:10] his disciples he wasn't praying for an
[1:12:12] escape from the world. They were going
[1:12:13] to stay in the world but he was praying
[1:12:16] that God would keep them from the evil
[1:12:18] in the world and that protection was
[1:12:21] going to come from the word. So where
[1:12:23] are we living? We're living right in
[1:12:25] Satan's Eden. We live smack dab in the
[1:12:28] middle of Satan's Eden. Listen, God
[1:12:31] built a wall for his children in his
[1:12:33] Eden.
[1:12:36] I want you to think about where God gave
[1:12:39] them a wall. He gave them a wall in a
[1:12:42] place of perfection.
[1:12:44] In Eden, when everything was perfect and
[1:12:47] in order and according to his word, he
[1:12:49] gave them a wall.
[1:12:51] Now, we're in Satan's Eden where nothing
[1:12:53] is in order. Nothing is imperfection and
[1:12:55] everything is perverted and everything
[1:12:57] is according to Satan's design. He's
[1:12:59] come to the pinnacle of his
[1:13:00] civilization. And when everything is
[1:13:02] wrong, God has restored the wall back
[1:13:05] for us. We're behind a wall in Eden, not
[1:13:09] God's Eden. We're behind a wall in
[1:13:11] Satan's Eden. And it's not a brick wall,
[1:13:13] and it's not a church building, and it's
[1:13:15] not a code of rules, and it's not a
[1:13:17] theology. Amen. It's the word of God.
[1:13:20] Amen. Amen. and it goes with us wherever
[1:13:23] we go. So, I'm just going to draw this
[1:13:25] little picture here. Praise
[1:13:29] God. Here's the road and here's here's
[1:13:34] us coming down the road of
[1:13:36] life. And we have to travel this life.
[1:13:40] We have to live in this life. We can't
[1:13:41] wait for it to get perfect to start
[1:13:43] living.
[1:13:44] And no matter where you go, whether you
[1:13:48] go to the
[1:13:51] factory, smoke
[1:13:53] stacks, or you go to college, the the
[1:13:57] place of higher
[1:14:01] learning, right? Amen.
[1:14:07] Wherever you
[1:14:09] go, you can be behind the wall.
[1:14:14] We have jobs that God's given us. But
[1:14:17] some of those jobs take us to places
[1:14:19] that are not pleasant. That's right. We
[1:14:22] have to work with people sometimes that
[1:14:23] are
[1:14:24] not spiritually
[1:14:29] uplifting. Is that diplomatic
[1:14:32] enough? We have to work in environment
[1:14:35] sometimes that is not
[1:14:37] conducive to be pleasurable for us, not
[1:14:40] conducive to the Christian life. It's
[1:14:42] the job God give us. He says, "I don't
[1:14:44] pray to take you out of the world, but
[1:14:46] to keep you from the evil that's in the
[1:14:48] world." Amen. You, some of us have to go
[1:14:52] to places of of higher education or or
[1:14:55] not even higher education. Sometimes you
[1:14:57] just got to go to school and you got to
[1:14:58] take different things. And there's many
[1:15:00] of you that have been to Apollo and and
[1:15:02] some that have been to UNO and some that
[1:15:03] have been OU and some that have been
[1:15:05] Ohio State. And those places aren't
[1:15:07] always sanctified.
[1:15:11] They're not always clean. They're not
[1:15:12] always clean of influences. They're not
[1:15:14] always free of of the world.
[1:15:20] But I've watched many of you pass
[1:15:21] through those places and you went in and
[1:15:25] you came out and you were preserved.
[1:15:29] Amen. Many of you have to go to
[1:15:31] workplaces and factories and and
[1:15:33] different businesses and office
[1:15:34] buildings and sometimes, listen,
[1:15:36] sometimes the medical field is worse
[1:15:38] than the factory. Yeah.
[1:15:42] The things people talk about, the jokes
[1:15:44] that they tell. Amen. The the the the
[1:15:46] the news that they bring up, their
[1:15:49] political views and their view on the
[1:15:50] world and all of these things are so
[1:15:52] contrary to the word. They're so
[1:15:54] opposite to what we believe. And we have
[1:15:57] to go into those environments. God never
[1:15:59] called us to be monks and start a
[1:16:00] monastery and all of us sit around
[1:16:02] behind wall build walls and sit here to
[1:16:05] be safe. Amen. It doesn't matter what
[1:16:07] job God gives you and where he sends you
[1:16:08] and what training you go to and what
[1:16:10] school you go to. If you stay behind the
[1:16:12] wall of his word, wherever God leads
[1:16:15] you, Amen. If it's to the wilderness,
[1:16:16] you can be safe behind the wall.
[1:16:19] If it's to a workplace and then all of a
[1:16:21] sudden you get assigned to a new area
[1:16:23] and that area has the the the most vile
[1:16:27] of the vile of people who want to talk
[1:16:28] about vile things all day. Hey, listen.
[1:16:31] If God leads you there, God can preserve
[1:16:33] you right there in Satan's Eden. If all
[1:16:35] you do is keep your mind on his word day
[1:16:38] and night and don't let any reasoning
[1:16:40] enter in and stay behind the word,
[1:16:44] God has given us something in this Eden.
[1:16:46] He gave his children something in his
[1:16:48] Eden and they walked around from behind
[1:16:50] it. He's given us something in this
[1:16:52] Eden. Amen. And it's our choice whether
[1:16:54] we stay behind it or walk out from
[1:16:56] around it.
[1:16:58] That's right.
[1:17:00] This message is the greatest gift that
[1:17:02] God has ever given to us to send a
[1:17:05] prophet on this age that can tap into
[1:17:06] the back part of God's mind that begin
[1:17:08] to restore back the word as it was
[1:17:10] intended to be and bring it right into
[1:17:13] our generation and teach us how to live
[1:17:15] the New Testament gospel in a modern
[1:17:18] era. Yeah. And he would tell us God
[1:17:21] doesn't like these things and way that
[1:17:23] God wants the women to dress and the way
[1:17:25] he wants the men to conduct themselves
[1:17:27] and what's right in marriage and divorce
[1:17:29] and who can marry and who can't marry
[1:17:31] and what what you can do in church and
[1:17:32] not do in church and whatever else you
[1:17:34] can imagine that he taught us. Amen. And
[1:17:37] if we would just receive the gift that
[1:17:39] God gave us, we would re re realize
[1:17:41] through the message he has rebuilt a
[1:17:43] wall that is impenetrable by the devil
[1:17:46] and all his reasonings of this
[1:17:48] scientific age.
[1:17:52] Brother man would tell us, amen, that
[1:17:54] science is of the devil.
[1:17:57] And then he would tell us, but you no
[1:17:59] educate, science is of the devil and
[1:18:01] education's of the devil.
[1:18:03] He says, but you got to have some to
[1:18:04] live in this world.
[1:18:07] So you go to take some schooling and
[1:18:10] you're going to the devil's playground.
[1:18:12] Yeah. But you can go and come out
[1:18:18] pure. Amen. Amen. Not because you know
[1:18:22] more. Not because you're stronger or you
[1:18:25] have a stronger
[1:18:26] willpower, but you can go and come out
[1:18:30] simply because you stay with what God
[1:18:33] brought us in this generation.
[1:18:36] It's simple. It's simpler than we make
[1:18:39] it. It's much easier than we make it.
[1:18:42] The struggle is when we are enticed by
[1:18:45] our own lusts
[1:18:49] and we begin to reason things. Well, why
[1:18:52] would he say this? Why this? I don't
[1:18:56] understand where it apply.
[1:19:00] Soon as we start going down that
[1:19:02] reasoning, that's a flu.
[1:19:05] Amen.
[1:19:07] That can give him access through the
[1:19:08] wall. I said, "God, some things I don't
[1:19:12] understand. Some things I don't
[1:19:14] understand. I don't know why, but I
[1:19:16] believe
[1:19:17] it. I I want to understand. I'm seeking
[1:19:20] to understand. God, help me to
[1:19:21] understand. But until I understand, it
[1:19:23] doesn't mean I'm going to neglect what
[1:19:24] we've been taught because I don't
[1:19:26] understand it.
[1:19:28] No, God, if you saw fit to bring it to
[1:19:31] us and teach it and show us in your
[1:19:32] word, this is the way you want us to
[1:19:34] live, then that's the right way to live.
[1:19:37] If these if this is the role of a woman,
[1:19:40] then praise God, that's the role of a
[1:19:42] woman. If this is the role of a man,
[1:19:44] then praise God, that's the role of a
[1:19:46] man. That's true. Doesn't matter what
[1:19:49] I've heard all my life or what the
[1:19:51] environment around me teaches. It
[1:19:53] doesn't matter even what what ideas
[1:19:54] bounce through my own mind. I'll reject
[1:19:56] them all and come back to your word.
[1:19:59] Amen. Because if I if I allow that flu
[1:20:02] to open and I allow that to come in,
[1:20:04] then all of a sudden my protection is
[1:20:06] gone and I'm going to find myself
[1:20:08] corrupt. Amen.
[1:20:11] Because whosoever committeth sin is the
[1:20:13] servant of sin. If we could go back to
[1:20:15] the PowerPoint
[1:20:17] now.
[1:20:19] See, when Adam was on the
[1:20:23] earth, he wasn't hemmed in by the wall
[1:20:26] of Eden cuz he was God of the earth. He
[1:20:30] could go wherever. And wherever he went,
[1:20:33] he was behind the wall.
[1:20:35] When Jesus Christ was on the earth,
[1:20:37] everywhere he went, he was behind that
[1:20:39] same wall. The wall of the word.
[1:20:42] He was safe behind the wa the wall.
[1:20:46] And listen, wherever we go, we can be
[1:20:49] behind the same wall.
[1:20:54] Praise God.
[1:21:00] John
[1:21:01] 17 14. I have given them thy word, and
[1:21:05] thy word has and the world hath hated
[1:21:07] them because they are not of the world,
[1:21:09] even as I am not of the world. I pray
[1:21:11] not that thou shouldest take them out of
[1:21:13] the world, but that thou should keep
[1:21:14] them from the evil. They are not of the
[1:21:16] world, even as I am not of the world. Do
[1:21:19] you believe God can keep you?
[1:21:21] He's chosen not at this time to take us
[1:21:23] out, but to leave us here. And we're
[1:21:26] surrounded by the world and all the
[1:21:28] things that are a part of the world.
[1:21:30] Amen. But he prayed for us that he would
[1:21:34] keep us from the evil. And I believe
[1:21:37] that prayer is still in effect today.
[1:21:39] Amen.
[1:21:41] In second Peter 2:1 19, it says, "While
[1:21:44] they promised them
[1:21:45] liberty, they themselves are the
[1:21:47] servants of corruption." These are false
[1:21:50] ministers coming in and telling people
[1:21:51] whatever they were telling them in that
[1:21:53] day. He says, "They themselves are the
[1:21:56] servants of corruption. For of whom a
[1:21:57] man has overcome of the same as he
[1:22:00] brought in bondage. For after they have
[1:22:02] escaped the pollutions of the world
[1:22:03] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[1:22:05] Savior Jesus Christ, they are again
[1:22:07] entangled therein and overcome. The
[1:22:09] latter end is worse with them than the
[1:22:11] beginning. For it had been better for
[1:22:13] them not to have known the way of
[1:22:15] righteousness than after they had known
[1:22:16] it, to turn from the holy commandment
[1:22:18] delivered unto them. But it has happened
[1:22:20] unto them according to the true proverb,
[1:22:23] the dog is turned to his own vomit
[1:22:25] again, and the s that was washed to a
[1:22:27] wallow in the
[1:22:29] mire, promising liberty, but bringing
[1:22:31] into bondage. Because anything contrary
[1:22:34] to the word brings bondage. Amen.
[1:22:39] Romans 6 says this. Know you not that to
[1:22:41] whom you yield yourselves servants to
[1:22:43] obey. His servants you are to whom you
[1:22:46] obey. Whether of sin unto death or of
[1:22:49] obedience unto righteousness. But God be
[1:22:52] thanked that you were the servants of
[1:22:53] sin. But you have obeyed from the heart
[1:22:55] that form of doctrine which was
[1:22:57] delivered to you. Being then made free
[1:22:59] from sin, you became the servants of
[1:23:02] righteousness.
[1:23:03] So whenever you yield yourself servants
[1:23:06] to obey, that's whose master that's
[1:23:08] whose servant you are. That's who your
[1:23:09] master is. And we think of you. We can
[1:23:13] think of vile wicked things and horrible
[1:23:15] sins. But if you just take the most
[1:23:18] simplest of sin, you can find this this
[1:23:22] uh truth plays out.
[1:23:25] Because you take the commandment that
[1:23:26] says don't lie.
[1:23:30] Does anybody believe that's a
[1:23:31] commandment of the Lord? Amen. Not to
[1:23:35] lie. When we go and we and we
[1:23:39] lie, all of the sudden we have broken
[1:23:43] through the barrier of protection for
[1:23:45] our heart and our mind. And we've given
[1:23:47] access to the devil because of the lie
[1:23:50] we
[1:23:51] told. And because of that lie, now a
[1:23:54] corruption starts to come into our heart
[1:23:56] because now condemnation starts to come
[1:23:59] in and condemnation starts to work on
[1:24:02] us. And then we have guilt and then we
[1:24:03] have shame. Then all of a sudden we are
[1:24:07] brought into
[1:24:08] bondage by what? By leaving the word. I
[1:24:12] mean so simple. It doesn't have to be
[1:24:14] super complicated. You say, "Well,
[1:24:16] that's because of sexual sins and that's
[1:24:18] because of addictions." No. The simplest
[1:24:20] of the simplest can bring us into
[1:24:22] bondage because whatever you yield your
[1:24:24] member servant to, you become a slave to
[1:24:27] that thing because now you can't set the
[1:24:30] record straight. Now, guilt and
[1:24:31] condemnation and now you it it starts to
[1:24:33] affect your fellowship and it starts to
[1:24:35] affect the way you hear service because
[1:24:37] the guilt and condemnation starts to
[1:24:38] bring you into corruption.
[1:24:41] Amen. Starts to darken your heart. Amen.
[1:24:43] Starts to separate you from the things
[1:24:45] of God. And the more that goes on and
[1:24:46] the more you have to support that lie
[1:24:48] with more lies, the deeper and darker
[1:24:49] you get. Until now, it's hard for you to
[1:24:52] come and sit in service. It's hard.
[1:24:54] Every time the preacher starts getting
[1:24:55] on something, you start to feel really
[1:24:57] uneasy on the inside because this thing
[1:24:59] needs to be exposed. You don't know how
[1:25:00] to expose it. And you're in absolute
[1:25:02] bondage
[1:25:04] over something that seems so
[1:25:07] simple. I did a chapel a couple weeks
[1:25:10] ago for the uh the students at Bible
[1:25:13] believers. And so we talked about some
[1:25:15] of these things and I just wanted to
[1:25:18] teach it to them. But as in teaching it
[1:25:20] to them, I got super blessed. I got
[1:25:22] super blessed because I realized how
[1:25:24] this is the trap that we all get trapped
[1:25:27] into. I mean, it's like if I told them I
[1:25:30] said if a child lies to their parents,
[1:25:34] they do something they weren't supposed
[1:25:35] to do and they lie about it. All of a
[1:25:37] sudden they've opened a door to a
[1:25:39] spirit.
[1:25:41] They brought corruption into their own
[1:25:43] heart and their own mind. And that
[1:25:45] corruption that they brought in starts
[1:25:47] to actually damage the relationship with
[1:25:49] their
[1:25:50] parents. Now, instead of running to mom
[1:25:52] and dad when they go from school,
[1:25:54] instead of running and embracing them,
[1:25:55] now they just want to bypass and go
[1:25:57] outside and kick a ball or they they
[1:25:59] want to go to their room. And it's the
[1:26:00] guilt and condemnation. Every time they
[1:26:02] get close to mom and dad and mom or dad
[1:26:04] pull them up close, they like it, but
[1:26:05] they don't like it. They they want to be
[1:26:07] embraced, but they want to get away
[1:26:08] because they got all this going on in
[1:26:09] the inside. All because they opened the
[1:26:12] door.
[1:26:14] Yes.
[1:26:16] And it brings us into
[1:26:18] bondage. So what was the commandment
[1:26:22] for? For freedom.
[1:26:25] The simplest of commandments to the most
[1:26:28] whatever we would say biggest or
[1:26:29] smallest, it's all to keep you and I
[1:26:32] free.
[1:26:35] The Bible talks about
[1:26:37] gossip, tailbearing,
[1:26:40] backbiting, right?
[1:26:44] Is it is that a theme in the New
[1:26:45] Testament?
[1:26:47] Tailbearing,
[1:26:49] backbiting. The Bible says, "A whisperer
[1:26:52] separateth very friends."
[1:26:56] We start gossiping and start something
[1:26:58] as simple as telling somebody something
[1:27:01] they don't need to know that they're not
[1:27:03] involved in that has nothing to do with
[1:27:05] them. That's gossip. And you know how we
[1:27:09] get around gossip as Christians? I'm
[1:27:11] telling you this so you could pray for
[1:27:13] them.
[1:27:15] Come on.
[1:27:17] You just pray for them. Don't go get all
[1:27:19] the prayer warriors together so you can
[1:27:21] share the story with them.
[1:27:25] But something as simple as gossip can
[1:27:28] destroy your relationship with your
[1:27:29] brothers and sisters.
[1:27:33] Then when you come to church, if you if
[1:27:36] you've been running somebody down or
[1:27:38] you've been gossiping, if you told
[1:27:39] something that somebody asked you not to
[1:27:40] tell or know something you know you
[1:27:41] shouldn't have told and you told it.
[1:27:43] Amen. Listen. And don't you ever think
[1:27:46] that that person you told it to won't
[1:27:48] tell it again.
[1:27:50] Yeah. Don't listen. Some of us have been
[1:27:53] long alive long enough to realize, Amen.
[1:27:55] If something turns their ear to listen
[1:27:57] to gossip, then that means they like
[1:27:59] gossip. And they're probably apt to
[1:28:01] repeat your gossip.
[1:28:04] Oh, I wish we could I wish we could have
[1:28:06] friends that when we're weak and we
[1:28:07] begin to say something to somebody, hey,
[1:28:09] I did you hear about so- and so, they
[1:28:10] would say, hey, let's not talk about it
[1:28:12] because I don't know that person. I'm
[1:28:13] not involved with them. and what you're
[1:28:14] going to tell me probably doesn't relate
[1:28:15] to me.
[1:28:18] And so I don't want to hear anything
[1:28:19] negative about anybody because I love my
[1:28:21] brothers and sisters and I want to think
[1:28:22] the best. Oh, if we could give each
[1:28:24] other that answer in our moments of
[1:28:26] weakness and temptation, we'd really
[1:28:27] help each other. And it's staying
[1:28:29] saying, "What
[1:28:31] happened? Tell me really
[1:28:35] what else happened? Is that all?"
[1:28:41] But see, this is something that we all
[1:28:43] deal with because we're human beings. It
[1:28:44] happens in households. It happens in
[1:28:46] churches. It happens everywhere you have
[1:28:47] human beings in workplaces and family
[1:28:50] gatherings and whatever. But when you
[1:28:53] begin to do that, all of a sudden, what
[1:28:56] happens is the next time you go to
[1:28:57] embrace that brother, that sister,
[1:28:59] you've got a guilty conscience. Yeah.
[1:29:02] Right. And then in the foyer, it's a
[1:29:05] little easier to walk past them and then
[1:29:06] to walk up to them, embrace them, and
[1:29:07] hug them because your conscience is
[1:29:09] bothering you because you know you told
[1:29:11] something you shouldn't tell. And you
[1:29:12] know, and especially when it comes back
[1:29:15] to you, you know, it spread three or
[1:29:16] four times. Oh my goodness. You're going
[1:29:19] to have a hard time.
[1:29:22] You're going to have a hard time.
[1:29:25] And what begins to happen in the
[1:29:27] simplest of simples of defying the
[1:29:30] commandments of the Lord begins to break
[1:29:33] down relationships and bring us into
[1:29:34] bondage and separate very friends in the
[1:29:37] Bible in and the proverb says chief
[1:29:39] friends.
[1:29:41] It begins to destroy and that's why and
[1:29:44] it's an abomination to the Lord those
[1:29:46] that sow discord among brethren. That's
[1:29:48] an abomination to God. That's just not
[1:29:50] that's not just a no no. Don't lie. It's
[1:29:52] an abomination to God. Those that sow
[1:29:54] discord among brother.
[1:29:57] So when we do something so simple, what
[1:30:00] we call so simple, we don't realize that
[1:30:03] we've brought ourselves under
[1:30:06] bondage. We are now locked up on the
[1:30:08] inside. We are now not free. And it's
[1:30:11] our own fault. It's not God's fault. And
[1:30:13] it's not God's chastisement.
[1:30:17] Is it chastisement? Sure. But we brought
[1:30:19] it completely upon ourselves. Amen. By
[1:30:22] walking past the barrier.
[1:30:25] Listen, there's so many things we can
[1:30:26] become ins snared with. Amen. We can
[1:30:28] have these hooks set in us and we can't
[1:30:30] get free from them. And sometimes we
[1:30:32] don't know how to get free from them
[1:30:33] because it goes on so long and
[1:30:35] relationships are so damaged. We don't
[1:30:36] know how to get free from them. It's
[1:30:38] because we didn't simply stay behind the
[1:30:41] wall.
[1:30:43] And now the wall's going away and we're
[1:30:46] damaging ourselves.
[1:30:48] The prophet of God, he taught us, he
[1:30:51] taught us about avoiding worldly
[1:30:53] fashions. He taught us about avoiding
[1:30:55] entertainments of the world and being
[1:30:56] influenced by the world. Amen. And if we
[1:30:58] don't listen to the prophet, then all of
[1:31:00] a sudden we start to get pick up these
[1:31:01] little influences. We start to get into
[1:31:03] entertainments. We start get into these
[1:31:05] things and those things have corrupting
[1:31:07] power inside of us. And they start to
[1:31:10] weaken our faith and they start to put
[1:31:11] the wrong ideas and thoughts in our
[1:31:13] mind. all because we just simply didn't
[1:31:16] listen to what we were told.
[1:31:20] And then we can look at the commandment
[1:31:22] and we can look at what God has given us
[1:31:25] for liberty and we can look at it as a
[1:31:28] barrier to
[1:31:31] pleasure. But there's nothing God gave
[1:31:34] us that is a barrier for a son and
[1:31:36] daughter of God. Everything God's told
[1:31:39] us is to preserve our liberty so that we
[1:31:42] stay free in our soul. We stay free in
[1:31:44] our minds. We stay free in our bodies.
[1:31:47] We don't start getting addicted to
[1:31:50] entertainments and videos. We don't
[1:31:52] start getting addicted to all these
[1:31:53] other things that are so addictive.
[1:31:55] Amen. That's bondage, friends.
[1:31:59] But the word of God came to give us
[1:32:01] liberty.
[1:32:03] And the truth was meant to set us free.
[1:32:06] It all depends on how we see this
[1:32:08] message, right? It all depends when we
[1:32:11] see the message and we hear brother
[1:32:12] Brandon and we hear him railing against
[1:32:14] sin and railing against fashions of the
[1:32:16] world and railing against waterhead
[1:32:18] haircuts and Jaclyn Kennedy fashions
[1:32:21] that sweeping out and railing against
[1:32:22] women on the police force. And you look
[1:32:24] at that and you begin to wse and say,
[1:32:26] "Oh, it's too much and it's too far."
[1:32:27] And we don't realize that's liberty.
[1:32:30] That's the wall to keep us free from the
[1:32:32] culture, from the world that is
[1:32:34] penetrating and tearing us down.
[1:32:40] I just invite you if you've ever seen
[1:32:42] the message as a limitation in a barrier
[1:32:44] or a cage, I pray you to go back and
[1:32:47] look at it again. Amen. Go back and look
[1:32:50] at it again because it was never even if
[1:32:53] somebody misused it, mishandled and made
[1:32:55] a cage out of it. That's just what a
[1:32:57] human being did. That's not what God
[1:32:58] did. That's not God's fault.
[1:33:02] Everybody misuses everything. Everything
[1:33:04] good is misused. Amen. Fatherhood's been
[1:33:07] abused. Motherhood's been abused.
[1:33:08] Teachers have the authority of teachers
[1:33:10] have been abused. Everything everything
[1:33:12] good gets abused. But because it's
[1:33:14] abused doesn't mean there's not true
[1:33:15] fatherhood and there's not true
[1:33:16] motherhood and there's not true
[1:33:17] teachers.
[1:33:21] If something's happened in our life and
[1:33:22] it's tainted us in a way that we see the
[1:33:24] message and the prophet and the things
[1:33:26] that he brought and the things that he
[1:33:28] taught and the restoration of the word
[1:33:29] and we see that somehow as a wall that's
[1:33:32] hemming us in, we have missed the whole
[1:33:34] picture. Because the reality is it
[1:33:36] doesn't hem you in. You can do
[1:33:39] whatsoever you want to do. God has not
[1:33:41] boxed you in. He has not hemmed you in.
[1:33:43] You're only boxed in in your own mind.
[1:33:46] The devil's lying to you, saying you're
[1:33:48] bound in this trap. No, you can go
[1:33:49] around it anytime you want to go around
[1:33:51] it and do whatever you want to do. God's
[1:33:53] not going to stop you.
[1:33:55] Right.
[1:33:57] All God has done is provide a shield of
[1:34:00] protection
[1:34:02] and invited you to come in. Yeah. Amen.
[1:34:05] And he told us it's perfect and it won't
[1:34:08] fail and it can't be penetrated and
[1:34:10] you'll be completely safe behind this
[1:34:12] wall. Amen. But whether we see it as
[1:34:15] protection or we see it as bondage
[1:34:17] depends on what's between our ears.
[1:34:21] But the way we see it is the benefit we
[1:34:24] get from it. Yeah. The way we view the
[1:34:28] commandments of God, the way we view the
[1:34:30] message, the way we view the word is
[1:34:33] actually the benefit we get out of it.
[1:34:36] Because I've seen individuals who
[1:34:39] without question just believe that God
[1:34:41] sent us a prophet and that God taught us
[1:34:44] what he wants us to know. And they just
[1:34:46] in a simple way just believe it. And you
[1:34:49] see them prosper and you see their
[1:34:51] families prosper and you see the
[1:34:52] protection that the word's promised.
[1:34:55] You see individuals who are always
[1:34:56] questioning everything. Did he really
[1:34:58] mean this? And why did he say this? And
[1:35:00] why did he teach that?
[1:35:02] And that's no way to live.
[1:35:05] It's no way to live. I say, let's go
[1:35:08] back to see what God has given us as a
[1:35:10] provision from God.
[1:35:13] Not the workings of man, the provision
[1:35:15] of God. It's the restoration of the
[1:35:17] word. Amen. It's the Bible brought back
[1:35:20] into our view with the scales taken off
[1:35:23] and all man's teaching stripped away so
[1:35:25] that we can come back and know what God
[1:35:27] wants.
[1:35:29] And we know where the wall is and we
[1:35:30] know where to stand.
[1:35:34] Amen. I think that's God has been so
[1:35:38] good to us to give us a wall.
[1:35:42] He's been so loving to us to restore the
[1:35:45] word. The greatest thing that has ever
[1:35:48] happened to me outside of being born
[1:35:51] again
[1:35:53] is hearing the voice of a prophet of
[1:35:55] God.
[1:35:57] That'll bring the truth of God's word
[1:35:59] back front and center.
[1:36:02] Where would we be without a prophet?
[1:36:05] Where would you be if there was an
[1:36:06] authority on the earth that could say
[1:36:08] God meant this when he said that he
[1:36:10] meant this and this is what God wants?
[1:36:12] If we didn't have an authority of a
[1:36:13] prophet, where would we be?
[1:36:16] Amen. We would be we would be tangled up
[1:36:18] in all kinds of stuff. But listen
[1:36:20] friends, listen. Uh this world is in a
[1:36:23] disaster. This world is burning down.
[1:36:26] Amen. Brother Van Priest, this world is
[1:36:27] falling apart again.
[1:36:30] And I say, "And again." Amen. And again,
[1:36:32] this world is falling apart. But look at
[1:36:34] your lives. Amen. God has given you
[1:36:36] families and homes and peace in your
[1:36:38] heart. And God, yeah, we have trials
[1:36:40] like everybody else, but we don't have
[1:36:41] them like everybody else. Amen. We have
[1:36:43] sicknesses come. We have troubles that
[1:36:45] strike. We have difficulties that come.
[1:36:47] But there's something inside of us.
[1:36:49] Amen. There's some peace inside of us,
[1:36:51] some connection with God because he's
[1:36:52] brought us back behind this word. And
[1:36:54] the devil can't get in and torment our
[1:36:56] mind and corrupt our soul and twist us
[1:36:59] up and knots and have us all tied up in
[1:37:01] bondage. We got to the place where we
[1:37:03] can be in the midst of a difficult
[1:37:04] circumstance and sing and dance because
[1:37:06] God is going to get me out of this
[1:37:08] because God has told me who I am and
[1:37:11] what he wants and I've stayed behind his
[1:37:13] wall.
[1:37:19] I would rather be free in my
[1:37:23] heart than in my body. Amen.
[1:37:30] Paul and Silas were not free
[1:37:32] when they were beaten
[1:37:35] when they went on trial and they laid
[1:37:36] upon them many stripes and they put them
[1:37:38] into the inner jail cell and they
[1:37:40] fastened them in stalks.
[1:37:43] They were not free, but they were free.
[1:37:48] But you have people that you work with
[1:37:50] and people you walk past and people you
[1:37:52] associate with. They're as free as free
[1:37:54] can be. They can get in their car and
[1:37:55] drive anywhere they want to drive. They
[1:37:57] got enough extra money to buy some more
[1:37:58] gas and go to another state. They can
[1:38:00] buy what they want in Walmart. They can
[1:38:03] do whatever they want. And they are
[1:38:04] absolutely in bondage and in misery.
[1:38:10] I want to be free like Paul and Silas
[1:38:11] was free. I want to free because the
[1:38:14] freedom that Christ gives the liberty
[1:38:17] that Jesus Christ has given us in
[1:38:20] restoring the word.
[1:38:23] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:12, "All
[1:38:25] things are lawful unto me, but all
[1:38:28] things are not
[1:38:29] expedient." All things are lawful for
[1:38:31] me, but I will not be brought under the
[1:38:33] power of
[1:38:35] any. Hey, listen. We We talk all the
[1:38:38] time about the law and and we're not
[1:38:41] under the law and and all of these
[1:38:42] things, but let's not get a wrong
[1:38:44] understanding of
[1:38:46] that. Christ came and fulfilled the law
[1:38:49] so that we don't have to fulfill the
[1:38:51] law. He fulfilled it for us. And by
[1:38:54] faith in him, we get credit for what he
[1:38:56] did for us. And he freed us from the
[1:38:58] bondage of trying to get close to God by
[1:39:00] keeping commandments.
[1:39:02] But that never made the law evil
[1:39:06] or bad. It was always beautiful. It was
[1:39:11] always good. What was the law? The Old
[1:39:14] Testament was law. Was just God giving
[1:39:16] man commandments so man could stay close
[1:39:18] to God and treat other people right.
[1:39:20] Yes.
[1:39:22] The law kept kept Israel healthy. Yeah.
[1:39:26] Free from disease. Yeah. In good
[1:39:28] fellowship and association with one
[1:39:30] another. Free from influx of enemies and
[1:39:33] spiritually free from false
[1:39:34] understanding and idolatry. Yeah. That's
[1:39:36] what the law was intended to do. It was
[1:39:39] intended to keep Israel free.
[1:39:43] But God gave them a law so that they
[1:39:45] could realize that in this corrupted
[1:39:47] hybrid flesh, I can't keep the law. Not
[1:39:50] because there's a problem with the law,
[1:39:51] but because there's a problem with me.
[1:39:54] So Jesus came in flesh to fulfill the
[1:39:57] law, to pay the price, to free me from
[1:39:59] the obligation of fulfilling the law.
[1:40:01] But it doesn't mean what God taught in
[1:40:03] the law was wrong. I should still take
[1:40:05] care of my neighbor. I should still
[1:40:07] Amen. I should still take care of the
[1:40:09] widow. I should still provide for the
[1:40:10] poor. I should still worship God and
[1:40:13] serve God.
[1:40:15] Praise God. Amen.
[1:40:20] Oh, in the message of prisoner, he says,
[1:40:22] "Now we're all born a free moral agent
[1:40:25] to make any decision that we wish to."
[1:40:28] God justly does that because he must put
[1:40:30] every man on the same basis or he put
[1:40:32] the wrong man. He put the first man on
[1:40:35] the wrong basis that he put on free
[1:40:37] moral agency. We're just exactly tonight
[1:40:39] like Adam and Eve. There's no
[1:40:41] difference. Right and wrong sets before
[1:40:42] either one of us. Life and death. We can
[1:40:45] make our choice. up to you to make it.
[1:40:48] Yeah.
[1:40:50] So this is my question to you. I mean
[1:40:54] most of us have heard and we heard
[1:40:56] things that we don't want to repeat and
[1:40:57] we don't want to talk about but just for
[1:40:58] an analogy people who have left the
[1:41:00] message said the message was bondage to
[1:41:02] me. I was
[1:41:04] bound but you left.
[1:41:09] You had the liberty to walk away. Yeah,
[1:41:12] whenever you wanted, you left. You chose
[1:41:15] a different lifestyle.
[1:41:17] It was only bondage in your mind.
[1:41:21] It was no bondage. It was only bondage
[1:41:23] because of the way you viewed it. And
[1:41:26] that might have been because somebody
[1:41:28] presented it wrong. No doubt that's
[1:41:30] happened. So, it's not we're not we're
[1:41:32] not giving anybody a free pass. That's
[1:41:35] right. But the problem is not the
[1:41:38] message because anytime you want to
[1:41:40] leave, you can leave.
[1:41:42] Anytime you want to practice something
[1:41:44] else, you can practice something else.
[1:41:46] Anytime you want to do something else,
[1:41:48] you who's going to stop you?
[1:41:52] Who's going to prevent you? Who's going
[1:41:54] to come arrest you and handcuff you and
[1:41:56] take you to what kind of jail? Yeah.
[1:42:01] See, it's only bondage because the
[1:42:03] devil's made it look like bondage.
[1:42:06] Amen. And that may be the fault if
[1:42:08] somebody's presented it wrong.
[1:42:11] We can all be in fault and presenting it
[1:42:13] wrong. But when we go back to the truth
[1:42:16] of God's word, it's never bondage.
[1:42:20] It's always liberty. Amen.
[1:42:24] If it starts to feel like bondage, we
[1:42:26] should say, "God, give me a pure
[1:42:28] revelation of your There's something I'm
[1:42:31] missing. It may be the way it's being
[1:42:33] presented to me. It may be the way I'm
[1:42:35] receiving it. It may be something from
[1:42:37] my past. It may be my own wrong
[1:42:39] understanding. But whatever it is, God,
[1:42:42] this this message feels like bondage to
[1:42:44] me. And I don't believe that you you
[1:42:45] meant it to be bondage. I believe you
[1:42:47] meant it to be freedom. So, would you
[1:42:48] please give me a revelation of the truth
[1:42:51] of your word?
[1:42:53] because this is the greatest freedom and
[1:42:55] freedom from bondage that is has struck
[1:42:58] this earth.
[1:43:01] Amen. It's the greatest thing that's
[1:43:03] happened to me in my lifetime.
[1:43:06] The freedom that I was bound up I was I
[1:43:10] was raised in church and I was raised
[1:43:12] knowing some degree of right and wrong
[1:43:14] and I had no capacity in myself to
[1:43:16] overcome no no matter how much I agreed
[1:43:18] with what was being taught to me. Amen.
[1:43:20] But this message come and brought a life
[1:43:22] of Christ back to me. Amen. You realize
[1:43:26] that the reason that Christ come and
[1:43:28] fulfilled the law was to free us from
[1:43:29] the obligation of having to fulfill it
[1:43:31] which we cannot do in these fallen
[1:43:32] condition, these fallen bodies. But he
[1:43:34] did it in such a way that he could
[1:43:36] sanctify us so he could bring his
[1:43:37] spirit. The same spirit that fulfilled
[1:43:40] the law is the same spirit that's
[1:43:41] available to you and I so that God can
[1:43:44] live his own law in you and I. He told
[1:43:47] him, he said, "There'll come a day when
[1:43:48] I'll write my law in their hearts."
[1:43:51] Amen. You know, God didn't say, "I'm
[1:43:53] going to throw away my law." No. He
[1:43:55] said, "No, I'm going to transfer the law
[1:43:57] from a book of ordinances and from
[1:43:59] having to keep it and master it so you
[1:44:00] can come to heaven." No, that's not it
[1:44:02] anymore. Now, I'm taking the same law
[1:44:06] and I'm putting it in your heart.
[1:44:12] Why? By the spirit of God. The same
[1:44:14] spirit that fulfilled the law is the
[1:44:16] same spirit that's here to fulfill it in
[1:44:18] you and I. It's not something we have to
[1:44:21] do in our own strength. It's not
[1:44:22] something we have to do. We can't.
[1:44:24] Israel never could. It was impossible
[1:44:26] because of the fallen nature of man.
[1:44:28] This is why Paul is saying, "Hey, he in
[1:44:30] in Romans 7, he said, "The law which was
[1:44:33] holy, the law which was good, it became
[1:44:35] death to me because it exposed all the
[1:44:38] faults inside of me and I never found
[1:44:40] inside of me the power to fully overcome
[1:44:42] all of these things." So what was meant
[1:44:44] for life became
[1:44:46] death. And we realized that was God's
[1:44:48] purpose because the law, Amen, was a
[1:44:50] school teacher. It was a school master,
[1:44:52] a tutor to bring us to Christ so that we
[1:44:54] realize we need redemption. We need
[1:44:56] Christ. We need somebody to take our
[1:44:58] place.
[1:45:00] And we need that life inside of us.
[1:45:03] So we don't ever want to make the
[1:45:05] commandments of God something negative.
[1:45:07] They're never negative.
[1:45:09] They're always positive. But we need the
[1:45:12] spirit of God to give us the strength to
[1:45:15] live this word. We'll never do it on our
[1:45:18] own. We'll never do it by
[1:45:20] oursel. Psalms 119 says, "The word is a
[1:45:23] lamp unto my feet and a light into my
[1:45:26] path." Amen. Then I want to I want to
[1:45:29] read
[1:45:30] this. Psalms 19, I just love this. Said,
[1:45:34] "The law of the Lord is
[1:45:36] perfect, converting the soul." Amen.
[1:45:40] The testimony of the Lord is sure,
[1:45:43] making wise the simple. The statutes of
[1:45:46] the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[1:45:48] The commandment of the Lord is pure,
[1:45:50] enlightening the eyes. The fear of the
[1:45:53] Lord is clean, enduring forever. The
[1:45:55] judgment of the Lord are true and
[1:45:58] righteous
[1:46:00] altogether. More to be desired are they
[1:46:03] than gold, yay, than much fine gold,
[1:46:05] sweeter also than honey, and the
[1:46:07] honeycomb. Moreover, by them as thy
[1:46:10] servant warned, and in keeping of them
[1:46:13] is great reward. Amen. There's nothing
[1:46:17] wrong with the
[1:46:18] law. The law was done away with because
[1:46:21] it could never bring anybody to
[1:46:22] perfection because of the sin nature,
[1:46:25] not because the nature of God's
[1:46:27] word. But praise God, friends, he's not
[1:46:30] asked us to keep this word by ourselves.
[1:46:34] He says, "If you'll open up to me and
[1:46:36] receive me, I'll come and live in you
[1:46:38] and I'll write my word in your hearts
[1:46:40] and I'll live that word through you if
[1:46:44] you just surrender to
[1:46:46] me." Man, don't don't ever listen isn't
[1:46:50] what you know what is bondage? Ignorance
[1:46:53] is bondage.
[1:46:57] God says, "My people perish for lack of
[1:46:59] knowledge."
[1:47:01] Ignorance is bondage.
[1:47:04] You know what freedom is? Revelation of
[1:47:06] the word.
[1:47:09] How many of us were bound in some
[1:47:10] traditional teaching that never could
[1:47:12] set us free? We can never get over we
[1:47:14] were bound because ignorance was
[1:47:16] bondage. But God came and shine this
[1:47:17] bright light to remove the ignorance to
[1:47:19] take away the bondage. Amen. To set us
[1:47:23] free. This message is freedom. Amen. And
[1:47:28] now with the word of God
[1:47:30] restored, you've got a force
[1:47:33] field. Sorry for using that terminology.
[1:47:35] That comes from my boyhood
[1:47:38] days. We'd play freeze tag and I had
[1:47:40] force field. You couldn't touch
[1:47:44] me. But now we're walking with a force
[1:47:47] field. It's invisible to the rest of the
[1:47:50] world. They can't see it. Amen. They
[1:47:52] don't know how it works, but we know how
[1:47:54] it works.
[1:47:56] Keep your heart and mind stayed on him.
[1:48:01] I set your word always before my face
[1:48:03] that I sin not against thee. I meditate
[1:48:06] on thee day and night. Amen. Why?
[1:48:09] Because that's my shield. That's my
[1:48:11] force field. That's the wall he gave me.
[1:48:13] I listen to the message. I read the
[1:48:15] message. I read my Bible. I pray. I stay
[1:48:17] in this word because this word is the
[1:48:19] wall.
[1:48:21] It is my force field. And now wherever I
[1:48:23] go, we find ourselves in difficult
[1:48:25] circumstances and we find ourselves in
[1:48:27] compromised positions, places we don't
[1:48:28] want to be, things we don't want to
[1:48:30] hear. Amen. And all kinds of things that
[1:48:32] go on. But you don't have to worry if
[1:48:35] you just stay behind the wall. None of
[1:48:37] that will penetrate to your mind.
[1:48:40] Amen. None of that will get down and
[1:48:41] corrupt your soul if you just stay
[1:48:43] behind the the wall of the word. And
[1:48:45] don't ever forget, it's a voluntary
[1:48:47] staying behind the wall. Amen. God never
[1:48:51] gave us a commandment. And God didn't
[1:48:53] send this
[1:48:55] prophet to chain us in the message.
[1:48:59] Amen. To bring us into the garden of the
[1:49:01] message and slam the iron gates closed
[1:49:03] and lock it so you'd be
[1:49:06] safe. Listen, you'll be safe wherever
[1:49:08] you go. If the message is in your heart,
[1:49:10] if you got the revelation of the word,
[1:49:12] you'll be safe. If you go to school, you
[1:49:14] go to work, you go wherever, you'll be
[1:49:15] safe. Amen. because you're behind the
[1:49:18] wall. And let's all stand together.
[1:49:21] Musicians, if you'd please
[1:49:23] come. Amen. Many things we didn't get
[1:49:26] to, but that's okay. We got to enough.
[1:49:30] Amen. To realize I'm I'm so thankful for
[1:49:33] what God has given to us. I don't know
[1:49:36] how I could ever thank him enough. I
[1:49:37] don't know how we could ever realize how
[1:49:39] free we really are. We live free and
[1:49:41] don't remember. Sometimes, it's been so
[1:49:43] long. We were in bondage. We don't
[1:49:44] remember what it was like to believe
[1:49:46] false things, to be confused about
[1:49:49] stuff. We don't remember that because
[1:49:50] we've been so long freed from those
[1:49:53] things. But I just say thank you, Lord
[1:49:55] Jesus. Thank you for your freedom. And
[1:49:58] let's bow our heads
[1:50:00] together. Dear heavenly father, we thank
[1:50:03] you Lord for your goodness to us, for
[1:50:06] your mercy and for your grace, Lord.
[1:50:08] that God, in the darkest of times, you
[1:50:11] restored a protection for your people.
[1:50:14] You brought a wall, an impenetrable,
[1:50:18] uncsurmountable wall to keep us safe.
[1:50:22] God, you've restored your word. And
[1:50:23] Lord, we love your word. And I pray,
[1:50:26] Lord Jesus, that you'd bring us a
[1:50:28] greater revelation of your word. That
[1:50:29] you would open our eyes to see. Lord, we
[1:50:32] come to you for the Isav in this
[1:50:33] generation. Would you just rub it in our
[1:50:35] eyes and open our eyes that we might see
[1:50:37] the truth of this end time message? And
[1:50:40] Lord, you've given us the privilege, the
[1:50:42] opportunity by free moral agency. We can
[1:50:45] choose whether we stay behind this wall
[1:50:46] or not. But God, I choose to stay behind
[1:50:49] this wall. Help me, Lord, where my
[1:50:51] failings are, where my shortcomings are.
[1:50:54] God, just bring more revelation to me,
[1:50:56] Lord, that I might see that wall at all
[1:50:58] times. That I might keep it before me,
[1:51:00] Lord. That I might keep your word before
[1:51:03] my face. So Lord, as you were in the
[1:51:05] wilderness, isolated and alone and
[1:51:08] hungry, but you were perfectly safe
[1:51:11] behind the word. God, when I find myself
[1:51:15] isolated and in need,
[1:51:18] alone, compromise and vulnerable, may
[1:51:20] Lord, the reality of the strength that
[1:51:23] you've placed us behind, may it come to
[1:51:26] our minds. May we realize how blessed we
[1:51:28] are, Lord, to have your word and how
[1:51:30] simple it can be just to take you at
[1:51:32] your word and hold steady and let you be
[1:51:35] our shield and let you be our rock and
[1:51:37] let you be our
[1:51:39] wall. God, I want to stay behind you. I
[1:51:42] want to stay under you, Lord. I want to
[1:51:44] be cloaked in you and surrounded by you,
[1:51:46] Lord. If this message is has built us a
[1:51:49] wall, I want to be behind it, Lord. I
[1:51:52] want to be right in the middle of it,
[1:51:53] Lord. I want to be in the thickest part
[1:51:55] cuz I know I can't make it on my own.
[1:51:58] Lord, I can't stay free. I can't uh
[1:52:00] avoid the vices and the trappings of the
[1:52:02] enemy. I'm not smart enough. I don't
[1:52:04] have enough knowledge or intellect or
[1:52:06] willpower. But God, I trust your word. I
[1:52:10] thank you for sending it to us, Lord.
[1:52:12] May you bless us, Lord. May you bless
[1:52:15] your people. May you give us a proper
[1:52:17] vision of what this message really is.
[1:52:20] May you give us the correct
[1:52:22] understanding. And may we rejoice in the
[1:52:24] protection you've given us. May we run
[1:52:27] into this strong tower and be safe,
[1:52:30] Lord, for you are the strong tower and
[1:52:32] you are the message and you are the word
[1:52:34] and you're our defender. You're our
[1:52:36] shield. You're our buckler. You're our
[1:52:37] strong tower. You're our mighty
[1:52:40] fortress. We run into you and are safe.
[1:52:44] Lord, we love you for all you've given
[1:52:46] to us. And may Lord, the reality become
[1:52:49] deeper ingrained in our souls. And Lord,
[1:52:52] I pray for our young people, Lord, our
[1:52:55] children and
[1:52:56] teenagers, those who still question,
[1:52:59] Lord, and have doubts. I pray, God, that
[1:53:02] you'd bring them a greater
[1:53:04] revelation. God, we don't want anybody
[1:53:07] to see this word as bondage. We want
[1:53:10] them to see it as
[1:53:11] liberty, freedom. Freedom from the
[1:53:14] trappings of the devil. Free from the
[1:53:16] ignorance of denominationalism. Free
[1:53:19] from all the ws of the enemy. God, help
[1:53:22] me to present the message the right way.
[1:53:25] Lord, forgive me, Lord, for my own
[1:53:27] humanity and my own
[1:53:29] eagerness. Lord, I don't ever want to
[1:53:32] present your glorious liberty the wrong
[1:53:34] way. Help me, God. Lord, just take over
[1:53:38] my life, Lord, and take over this gift
[1:53:40] you placed in me. May we constantly,
[1:53:42] Lord, be presenting your truth, Lord, in
[1:53:45] the way that you want it presented and
[1:53:47] give people opportunity, Lord, to step
[1:53:49] behind your glorious
[1:53:51] wall. For God, we stand in Satan's Eden
[1:53:53] and there's no way we're going to make
[1:53:55] it on our own. Lord, we need your
[1:53:57] protection. Lord, we go to places, Lord,
[1:54:00] that are compromised. We hear things,
[1:54:01] Lord, that are ungodly. We're exposed to
[1:54:04] things in our eyes and our ears and all
[1:54:06] around us, Lord, that that would take
[1:54:08] our souls
[1:54:09] away. But oh God, in this hour, you've
[1:54:12] given us the greatest, Lord, the
[1:54:14] greatest you could, the greatest wall,
[1:54:17] the greatest protection. And I want to
[1:54:18] thank you for this message. I want to
[1:54:21] lift my hands to you, Lord, and say,
[1:54:22] "I'm so grateful, Lord, to live in this
[1:54:24] day. And I'm so grateful you gave me
[1:54:26] ears to hear. I'm so grateful you let
[1:54:29] tapes and books come my way. I'm so
[1:54:30] grateful for a fellowship of believers
[1:54:32] that believe this word and that we can
[1:54:34] grow together, Lord, into your likeness.
[1:54:36] I'm so thankful that you allowed me to
[1:54:38] hear your prophet's voice.
[1:54:41] God, you have protected me. You've
[1:54:42] protected my family. You've protected my
[1:54:44] children. Who knows what would have
[1:54:46] happened to us without this wall. And
[1:54:49] God, we want to stay behind it. We want
[1:54:51] to serve you and love you and give you
[1:54:53] our lives as a sacrifice. I want to be
[1:54:55] chained, Lord. Not chained behind a
[1:54:57] wall. Not chained behind doctrine. I
[1:54:59] want to be chained by chains of love.
[1:55:02] Bound to you because there's no place
[1:55:04] else I want to be but attached to you.
[1:55:07] Lord, bless us as we move from here. May
[1:55:10] we recognize what it is you've given us
[1:55:12] and done for us. And may we get the full
[1:55:14] advantage of it, Lord, in our lives. In
[1:55:17] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:55:21] Amen. Amen. God bless you. And we're
[1:55:24] going to plan on coming back here at 400
[1:55:26] p.m. for uh communion and feet washing.
[1:55:29] God bless you, brother John.
[1:55:32] Keep your
[1:55:35] mind
[1:55:37] stay on
[1:55:40] me.
[1:55:42] Stay on
[1:55:45] me faithfully.
[1:55:51] And
[1:55:52] I will
[1:55:54] give you
[1:55:58] perfect
[1:56:00] peace,
[1:56:02] sweet
[1:56:04] release, if you'll just keep your mind
[1:56:10] stayed on me.
[1:56:16] So keep your
[1:56:20] mind
[1:56:21] stay on
[1:56:25] me.
[1:56:26] Stay on
[1:56:29] me
[1:56:30] [Music]
[1:56:33] faithfully and
[1:56:36] I will
[1:56:38] give you
[1:56:41] perfect peace.
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:45] Sweet
[1:56:47] relief. If you'll just keep your mind
[1:56:52] state on
[1:56:56] me, I give my
[1:57:00] mind completely to
[1:57:03] you,
[1:57:06] Lord. Fill me with your thoughts.
[1:57:12] Make it all brand new. Change my
[1:57:18] life and let me live in all that's
[1:57:25] true. I just want to think like you.
[1:57:33] So
[1:57:35] take
[1:57:37] me and
[1:57:39] mold
[1:57:41] me. Teach me
[1:57:45] to be
[1:57:49] still and
[1:57:52] lead
[1:57:54] me and
[1:57:56] guide me.
[1:57:59] Show me your
[1:58:02] perfect
[1:58:05] will. I give my
[1:58:10] mind completely
[1:58:13] due.
[1:58:15] Lord, fill me with your
[1:58:19] thoughts. Make it all brand new. Change
[1:58:24] my life.
[1:58:28] Let me live in all that's
[1:58:33] true. I just want to think like you.
[1:58:40] So
[1:58:42] take
[1:58:44] me
[1:58:49] and teach me
[1:58:52] to be
[1:58:56] still.
[1:58:58] Lead
[1:59:00] me and
[1:59:02] guide me.
[1:59:05] Show me your
[1:59:08] perfect
[1:59:11] will. I give my
[1:59:15] mind completely to
[1:59:19] you,
[1:59:21] Lord. Fill me with your
[1:59:25] thoughts. Make it all brand new. Change
[1:59:30] my life.
[1:59:33] Let me live in all that's
[1:59:38] true. I just want to think like
[1:59:43] you. He paid a debt. He did not owe. I
[1:59:51] owed a debt I could not pay. I needed
[1:59:59] someone to wash my sins
[2:00:03] [Music]
[2:00:05] away. And now I sing a brand new
[2:00:11] song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ
[2:00:17] Jesus paid a debt that I could never
[2:00:23] pay.
[2:00:26] And he paid a debt at
[2:00:31] Calary. Cleansed my soul, set me free.
[2:00:36] I'm glad that
[2:00:39] Jesus did all my sin
[2:00:45] erase. I now can sing a brand new song.
[2:00:52] Amazing grace. All day long, Christ
[2:00:56] Jesus paid a debt that I could never
[2:01:05] pay. And now he's coming back for me.
[2:01:11] I'll live with him
[2:01:14] eternally. Won't it be
[2:01:18] glorious to see him on that
[2:01:23] day? And I now will sing a brand new
[2:01:29] song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ
[2:01:35] Jesus paid a debt that I could never
[2:01:41] pay.
[2:01:43] Oh, he paid a debt he did not owe. I
[2:01:49] owed a debt I could not pay. I needed
[2:01:56] someone to wash my sins
[2:02:02] away. And now I sing a brand new song.
[2:02:08] Amazing grace. All day long, Christ
[2:02:13] Jesus paid a debt that I could never
[2:02:19] pay.
