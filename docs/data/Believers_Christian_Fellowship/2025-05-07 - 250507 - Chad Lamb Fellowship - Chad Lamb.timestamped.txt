[0:00] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[0:03] hallelujah roll. Help me ring the
[0:06] Savior's praises far and
[0:09] wide. For I've opened up toward heaven
[0:12] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[0:16] living on the hallelujah
[0:19] side. Once a sinner far from Jesus, I
[0:23] was perishing with cold. But the blessed
[0:26] savior heard me when I

[0:50] For I've opened up toward heaven all the
[0:53] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[0:57] the hallelujah
[0:59] side. Though the world may sweep around
[1:02] me with her dazzle and her dreams, yet I
[1:06] envy not her vanities and
[1:09] pride. For my soul looks up to heaven
[1:12] where the golden sunlight leaps. And I'm
[1:16] living on the hallelujah
[1:19] side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[1:23] hallelujah robe help me ring the
[1:26] savior's praises far and
[1:30] wide. Open up toward heaven all the
[1:33] windows of my soul. And I'm living on
[1:36] the hallelujah side.
[1:40] Not for all her scolding millions would
[1:43] I leave this precious place. Though the
[1:45] tempter to persuade me off has
[1:49] tried. For I'm safe in God's pavilion,
[1:52] happy in his love and grace. And I'm
[1:55] living on the hallelujah side. Oh, glory
[2:01] be to Jesus. Let hallelujah ro. Help me
[2:05] ring the savior's praises far and wide.
[2:10] For I've opened up toward heaven all the
[2:13] windows of my soul and I'm living on the
[2:17] hallelujah
[2:18] side. Well, here the sun is always
[2:21] shining. Here the sky is always bright.
[2:24] There's no place for gloomy Christians
[2:27] to
[2:28] abide. For my soul is filled with music
[2:32] and my heart with great delight. And I'm
[2:35] living on the hallelujah side.
[2:39] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the

[2:45] Savior's praises far and
[2:48] wide. For I've opened up toward heaven
[2:52] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[2:55] living on the hallelujah side.
[2:59] And upon the streets of glory when we
[3:02] reach the other shore. And I've safely
[3:05] crossed the Jordan's rolling
[3:08] tide. You will find me shouting glory
[3:11] just outside my mansion door where I'm
[3:15] living on the hallelujah
[3:18] side. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[3:22] hallelujah roll. Help me ring the
[3:25] savior's praises far and wide.
[3:29] For I've opened up toward heaven all the

[21:45] Uh let's open our Bibles and let's stand
[21:48] together. Let's open to Proverbs. I'm

[21:51] me to come on up. If you guys can come
[21:53] on up, I'm going to have each of them
[21:54] share a testimony uh from the trip,
[21:57] their own personal testimony, so they
[22:00] can join us here on the platform.
[22:02] They're super excited about this.
[22:03] They've been looking forward to it since
[22:05] I asked them and they can't wait as you
[22:08] all could
[22:09] imagine. And I didn't ask them if they
[22:11] wanted to. I just told them they were
[22:14] cuz there's no point in asking. You
[22:15] know, I know what the answer will be.
[22:18] So, Proverbs
[22:22] 25 verse
[22:25] 25. Proverbs 25:25. as cold waters to a
[22:29] thirsty soul. So is good news from a far
[22:32] country. So hopefully we can bring you
[22:34] some good news from a far country today.
[22:36] You can have your seats. Amen. So I just
[22:40] want to say it was a privilege to be
[22:42] able to uh travel with these three young
[22:44] men. We had a nice trip there. We had
[22:47] always there's always some adventures,
[22:49] but we we were able to go and then they
[22:53] were very faithful. They stayed right
[22:54] with me. As soon as we got there, they
[22:56] disappeared and I didn't see them again
[22:58] till it was time to go. So, they made
[23:01] piles of friends and they had a good
[23:03] time. And so, we're going to let each of
[23:05] them take a take a little bit of time
[23:06] here and share with you their own
[23:08] testimonies of what they saw and heard
[23:10] and what the Lord did for them
[23:12] personally. And then I'll come up and
[23:14] cap it off and share a little bit out of
[23:15] the word. Amen. So, let's make it easy
[23:18] for them. Smile at them and nod your
[23:20] head and because you know they're super
[23:22] excited. All right, Josh, why don't you
[23:25] come up here first?
[23:31] Oh my, it's good to be home. And uh I I
[23:35] didn't want to think about it because I
[23:36] didn't want to be nervous. And uh so I
[23:39] don't have anything wrote down, but I
[23:40] figured I went through it. I experienced
[23:42] it. And uh it was all a very fond
[23:45] memory. Um I'm going to, you know,
[23:48] cherish for forever. But um well, we got
[23:52] there
[23:53] um and we went with Nathan and he took
[23:56] us out to eat and there's something
[23:58] about uh their hospitality in Europe and
[24:01] I think they were trying to fatten us
[24:02] up. I don't I don't know. But um they
[24:05] fed us and then we went to the the house
[24:08] and then they fed us some more and then
[24:10] we went to brother Nathan's after
[24:12] another couple hours and his wife had a
[24:14] whole spread for us and so they just fed
[24:17] us and fed us and it's hard to complain
[24:19] with such good food. Uh that and then
[24:21] the the coffee was amazing. So in
[24:24] between food you had coffee and a
[24:25] dessert. So uh but you know that was
[24:28] just natural food but the spiritual food
[24:30] as well. um just to see the people and
[24:33] the expectation that they had and they
[24:35] came you know from the different
[24:36] countries uh and they traveled hours um
[24:39] some you know from the other side of
[24:41] Poland even it was 5h hour drive and
[24:43] then there was you know the ones from
[24:45] England brother uh Simon Abbott and his
[24:47] family you know they came 10 hours or
[24:49] more I believe it was it was quite a
[24:51] trip but you know just the expectation
[24:53] the people coming and it was it was
[24:55] wonderful to see and you know the
[24:57] services they they benefited greatly
[25:00] from y'all's prayer players as well. Um,
[25:02] and you know, it it wouldn't it wasn't
[25:05] just from one one person um or anything
[25:08] from us. It was uh each one having had a
[25:11] part in it even from home. And uh but
[25:14] yeah, like you said, we met many people.
[25:16] Um it was it was a lot of fun getting to
[25:18] meet people and the I guess for me the
[25:21] one thing that was the sad part about
[25:22] the trip is the language barrier and
[25:24] there was a few people I couldn't talk
[25:25] to. So I you know I love talking to
[25:29] people and just getting to know them. Um
[25:31] and uh you know there was there was
[25:33] times when it was just you know one day
[25:35] we'll get a talk and there won't be a
[25:36] language barrier and it'll just be
[25:38] fellowship forever. Uh but but yeah and
[25:41] then we we ended up taking a trip to
[25:43] Ashitz. I'm going to steal all their all
[25:44] their inspiration. CM has it all wrote
[25:46] out and he probably I'm probably walking
[25:48] on it but it was good because the spies
[25:50] the spies when they went into Canaan
[25:52] land I don't believe that they all had
[25:53] different stories. They probably brought
[25:54] the same same Joshua and Caleb probably
[25:56] brought the same the same news of the
[25:58] grapes and and the fruit. So, you know,
[26:00] they can bring it the same thing, too.
[26:02] But, uh, but it was wonderful just
[26:05] getting to know everybody and to see the
[26:07] Oshwitz, Brother Yatsk had, uh, had had
[26:10] paid for us to go. So, we really
[26:11] appreciated brother Yatik doing that.
[26:13] And, um, it was it was an experience and
[26:16] it was good to see while we were there.
[26:17] And, uh, but yeah, other than that, it
[26:20] was it's good to be home. The flights
[26:21] were long, but they were good. the God
[26:24] guide the guide the guided the the ship.
[26:27] So, uh it's but it's good to be home and
[26:30] I'm going to let somebody else take a
[26:31] turn.
[26:39] Well, God bless you, brothers and
[26:41] sisters. Like Josh said, it's good to be
[26:43] home. I am not comfortable up here by
[26:45] any means. Um but it's still good to see
[26:48] you all. Um the trip was absolutely
[26:51] wonderful. We had a wonderful time. It
[26:53] was it was such a privilege and such a
[26:55] blessing to be able to go to see the
[26:57] believers over there and and uh
[26:59] especially brother Nathan that when he
[27:01] came and and visited us and uh you know
[27:05] when when someone comes that quick and
[27:06] you get to spend a little bit of time
[27:08] with them and then being able to go over
[27:10] there and we spent a week with him and
[27:12] we we stayed at his house for several
[27:13] nights and boy really drew close to him
[27:17] really uh really bonded with him and
[27:20] found a real friend in him and had a a
[27:24] lot of fellowship around around the
[27:26] things of God and also with music, being
[27:29] a musician and uh he was just such an
[27:31] encouragement to me, a blessing to me.
[27:34] Um so uh God bless him. Uh I believe
[27:37] brother Cornelius is awake right now
[27:39] streaming. God bless you. Uh you're a
[27:42] trooper. We we we love and appreciate
[27:44] him. We got to spend some time with him
[27:46] as well. We were hoping to surprise him
[27:48] and we didn't get to do that. He uh he
[27:50] live streams about everywhere on the
[27:52] planet and uh we uh we didn't get to
[27:56] surprise him but uh it was still a
[27:58] wonderful time to see him and we met so
[28:01] many uh of the believers of brother
[28:03] Nathan's family and uh and uh so many of
[28:07] the other believers you would see on the
[28:09] camera. It was
[28:11] uh it was a life-changing moment when
[28:14] when you run up there and see them all.
[28:17] It uh it was like family. they uh it's
[28:21] like we always knew them. And it's one
[28:22] thing when you know a believer would go
[28:25] and and you hear their testimony coming
[28:28] back and they say, "Oh, it's like
[28:30] family." But when you experience it
[28:31] yourself, when you experience the love
[28:34] of God projected through somebody else,
[28:36] to you personally, uh that was it was
[28:40] overwhelming and uh it was it made it so
[28:44] real to me personally. Um the services
[28:48] were such a blessing and uh God bless
[28:50] brother Chad. So many services. Uh it
[28:54] was it was a real privilege to be able
[28:55] to go with him to see you know what
[28:57] that's like at least the times we saw
[28:59] you. And
[29:02] uh we did uh we it was few and far
[29:06] between. Uh but uh we we still uh we
[29:12] were still blessed by him and brother
[29:13] Andreas for the services. We were there
[29:15] in the midweek service. We got to go to
[29:17] a an assembly there and meet some
[29:19] believers
[29:20] there. Uh we met brothers and sisters
[29:22] from other countries, not just Poland,
[29:24] and made friends with them. We got all
[29:26] their numbers and and uh so it was it
[29:29] was a wonderful time. Uh so blessed so
[29:33] blessed to have gone. Uh definitely a
[29:35] life-changing experience.
[29:38] Um and uh I don't know what else to say.
[29:42] It was it was such a blessing and uh so
[29:45] privileged to have gone. And uh if you
[29:47] ever get to go, do
[29:50] it. Be a blessing. It's it's you'll be a
[29:53] blessing just going. You know, we they
[29:55] kept saying, "Oh, you're such a
[29:57] blessing. You're such a blessing." And
[29:58] we didn't do anything. We were just
[30:00] there just smiling and and enjoying
[30:03] their fellowship. But it was a blessing
[30:06] to them. And it's just a blessing to be
[30:08] able to meet those brothers and sisters
[30:10] on this side. So God bless you all.
[30:27] Hello brothers and sisters. God bless
[30:29] you. Praise the Lord. Uh I thought about
[30:31] doing this all in Polish but um I
[30:33] decided not to. I probably would have
[30:34] ran out of words pretty quick, but
[30:37] um I just want to start off um by
[30:40] there's so many people that said that
[30:42] bring greetings. There's so many that
[30:44] all over the place. I don't even want to
[30:46] start naming them. Just so many people
[30:47] said they love you, they appreciate you,
[30:48] they're praying for you. It's just
[30:50] wonderful to hear that from the other
[30:52] side of the world. And this is the first
[30:54] time overseas for us three boys. And it
[30:57] was amazing. It was so smooth. Um
[31:00] brother Chad told us before, he's like
[31:01] Poland's probably the best place he
[31:02] could have chose. There's not going to
[31:03] be any roughing it at all. It was going
[31:05] to be pretty easy. And I can say there
[31:07] was no roughing it at all. This is
[31:08] probably the hardest thing there was. Um
[31:13] but but like like Josiah and and Josh
[31:16] were saying, just meeting those those
[31:18] saints over there was just absolutely
[31:19] incredible. These are ones that you you
[31:22] see on the screen so many times through
[31:24] music, through their services. And I
[31:27] just remember one vivid memory. I
[31:28] remember Nathan, he's taking us to the
[31:30] church for the first time to go help um
[31:32] take down some equipment to prepare for
[31:34] the camp, help the brothers out that
[31:35] were there. We get into the sanctuary
[31:37] and no one's there and we're like,
[31:38] "Where's everybody at?" He's like,
[31:39] "Wait, I know they're all upstairs
[31:41] drinking coffee right now, taking a
[31:42] break." So, so we all went upstairs and
[31:45] it was just amazing. We get to the top
[31:47] and 10 brothers come running after us,
[31:49] shaking our hands, hugging us, and it's
[31:50] just, it was so surreal to be talking to
[31:52] these brothers in flesh that you see on
[31:55] the screen so many times. It was just so
[31:57] so amazing. And I just everybody there
[31:59] is just so precious, so so nice. And um
[32:02] and like Josh was saying, food was
[32:04] phenomenal. It was it was it was so
[32:07] good. And like they just stuffed us.
[32:09] Like I I could not eat anymore. I was
[32:11] like I was I can't do this. But it was
[32:12] amazing food. The Lord blessed us with
[32:14] amazing weather too. It was just always
[32:16] sunny. It was in the 70s about the whole
[32:18] time. It was just wonderful. And um the
[32:22] meetings the meetings were incredible. I
[32:23] I just I can't even explain it. I know I
[32:25] went with a few things on my heart just
[32:27] to just to um for the Lord to become so
[32:29] much more real to me personally, him to
[32:32] become so much more alive to me
[32:33] personally. And I just I brought my cup
[32:35] and the Lord filled it and he just kept
[32:36] pouring just overflowing. It was just it
[32:39] was so amazing and and the Lord's so
[32:41] good and and just unveiling that mystery
[32:43] that's inside me telling me who I am.
[32:45] And I just sat there and just and just
[32:48] it was so amazing. Just all I could say
[32:50] was what amazing grace that he came my
[32:52] way. It was just it was so so so
[32:54] amazing. And I just thank the Lord so
[32:56] much for that. And um I just I remember
[33:00] I remember running to brother Cornelius
[33:01] afterwards and I just like shook him. I
[33:03] was like I'm touching the mystery
[33:05] unfolded in an earthn vessel. I was like
[33:07] shook him. I was like, "Oh my goodness,
[33:08] this is so amazing." And it just we just
[33:10] rejoiced in it. It was just the meetings
[33:12] were just so precious. I'm going to
[33:14] remember them forever. But I just want
[33:16] to thank brother Chad for letting me go,
[33:17] allowing me to go. It was wonderful. and
[33:19] my fellow companions, traveling
[33:21] companions. They were amazing. I thank
[33:23] everyone in Poland, Brother Yatik. I
[33:25] appreciate them a lot for hosting the
[33:27] meetings and doing all that. And then
[33:29] also a special a special thank you to
[33:31] Brother Nathan and Sister Ruth. Their
[33:33] hospitality was amazing. They took care
[33:35] of us so much. Sister Ruth's cooking is
[33:37] amazing. It was just it was absolutely
[33:39] wonderful. And I thank I thank all of
[33:40] you for praying for us. It was uh we
[33:43] really could feel those prayers over
[33:44] there. And I just thank the Lord above
[33:46] all for letting me go on this trip. is
[33:48] so encouraging to me. And well, you'll
[33:51] see a few pictures by the chat will show
[33:53] a handful of pictures, but I think us
[33:55] guys got over like a thousand or
[33:56] something. So, if you want to if you
[33:58] want to see any more, let us know. We'll
[33:59] get together and and we'll we'll look at
[34:01] them. So, God bless you.
[34:12] Amen. You're released.
[34:16] I told them not to go anywhere cuz if
[34:17] they didn't do long enough, I was going
[34:18] to make them come back and do it
[34:20] again. So, they passed the
[34:24] test. Amen. It was a real pleasure to
[34:27] have them along and and um I kept having
[34:31] um people come up to me and tell me uh
[34:34] how blessed they were and thank they
[34:36] kept thanking me for bringing these guys
[34:38] along. I said, "Yeah, it was great." You
[34:40] know, you're welcome.
[34:43] But it wasn't just that they received a
[34:45] blessing, they also were a blessing. And
[34:47] we know what it's like to receive
[34:49] visitors here and it's always a blessing
[34:51] for us. And the, you know, brother
[34:53] Nathan who they stayed with is brother
[34:55] Nathan Mur who's been here twice with
[34:57] brother Yatsik and sang specials for us
[34:59] and we've had some fellowship and so
[35:00] they got to stay with him and and so
[35:03] he's been a blessing to us and you know
[35:05] they felt the blessing in return by
[35:07] having these young men come and visit
[35:09] with them. And I can say it was an
[35:12] amazing time. I'd like to just show you
[35:14] a few pictures before we get into the
[35:16] word and just share with you some things
[35:19] uh that we saw.
[35:23] Um I can't Yeah. So this is I can't see
[35:29] back here. The screen's not working. All
[35:31] right. You can see we were went to
[35:33] Poland. They were there a week. I was a
[35:36] little there a little longer. I took um
[35:38] after they left I went down to Ukraine
[35:40] for some services. But we had seats. We
[35:42] had these amazing seats. All four of us
[35:45] of us in a row. See how perfect that is?
[35:48] We were going to fly over there and
[35:49] fellowship and talk to each other. And
[35:52] before we took off, they canceled the
[35:53] flight and said there was a problem with
[35:55] the plane. They needed an inspection and
[35:57] they couldn't get an inspector. So they
[35:59] got us all off the plane. Then they put
[36:01] us on a new plane. They split us all up.
[36:05] And so I was in I mean they split all
[36:08] four of us in different seats all over
[36:10] the plane. So I went and talked to them
[36:11] and see if we could rearrange and they
[36:13] we couldn't get all together but they
[36:14] were able to get the three brothers
[36:16] together in the back and they got me up
[36:19] further to the front and so I would go
[36:21] back and visit them from time to time.
[36:23] They were behaving themselves and all of
[36:24] that. Mostly they were asleep. I had to
[36:27] wake them up to say hi but uh so we
[36:29] didn't quite get the seat that we wanted
[36:32] but it worked out good and we had good
[36:33] flights. This is at brother Nathan's
[36:35] house. This is where the brothers stayed
[36:37] the first couple of nights before the
[36:39] camp. And then uh brother Nathan
[36:41] arranged some fellowship for him. And so
[36:43] you can see Cornelius joined in. And
[36:46] Cornelius has been here twice so we know
[36:48] him well. And to the right of the screen
[36:49] is brother Tom. He's one of the
[36:51] ministers there. And to the left is uh
[36:53] Daniel Mur, which is Nathan's uncle. And
[36:55] he's an evangelist out of that church.
[36:57] Been ministering for a long time. Very,
[36:59] very active. I've actually asked him to
[37:01] come and I'm hoping he'll be able to
[37:02] come sometime this summer. and minister
[37:04] for
[37:05] us. And um this is the last day that
[37:08] that the brothers were there before they
[37:10] left. We went to this really nice
[37:11] traditional Polish restaurant. But
[37:13] that's Nathan and his wife Ruth. And
[37:15] she's the one who did all that amazing
[37:17] cooking. You can tell we were traveling
[37:19] with young men because the food was
[37:21] amazing. The food was great. The food
[37:22] was amazing. And we had plenty of it,
[37:25] you know. So that's pretty important
[37:28] when you're in your 20s still.
[37:31] So this is some of the countryside. It
[37:35] was nice to have brother Sam Samuel
[37:36] there because he likes to take pictures.
[37:38] So when I go on a trip, I come back with
[37:40] like three pictures. He comes back with
[37:42] a thousand. So compliments Samuel. You
[37:45] can see the second half of the trip
[37:46] doesn't have as many pictures and most
[37:48] of the pictures I have were something
[37:50] somebody sent me. So not what I took. So
[37:54] we got there I believe on Tuesday. Uh
[37:57] Wednesday we went to this church here.
[37:59] It's not too far away from brother
[38:01] Yodsix and we had uh a service there on
[38:03] Wednesday night. This is from the back
[38:05] of the church and this is one of the
[38:07] brothers took a picture from their seat
[38:10] and so we had that Wednesday and then
[38:12] Thursday we moved into the camp. Uh but
[38:14] immediately on Tuesday Nathan took the
[38:16] brothers went to his house and then uh
[38:18] they went straight to the church and
[38:20] started loading up stripping out gear.
[38:22] So they they just integrated right in
[38:24] with brother Yatsik's church and with
[38:26] their young men and started working. So
[38:28] they had to strip everything out of
[38:29] their church, move it over to camp and
[38:30] set it all up. So the next time I saw
[38:33] them was Thursday at the camp and they
[38:34] were there helping string out cables and
[38:36] unload trucks and get stuff set up. And
[38:39] so uh that it was nice. It was nice.
[38:42] They enjoyed having their help and they
[38:44] liked being part of it and it was nice
[38:46] to be able to see some of the behind the
[38:48] scenes. So I got a little video clip of
[38:50] the worship service at the
[38:57] [Music]
[39:09] Amen. And then you can see this is uh uh
[39:13] brother Cornelius. He started doing some
[39:14] translation. So this is uh the song
[39:17] leader. This is what they're in the
[39:18] worship night and he's translating for
[39:20] their deacon there. uh because they
[39:22] pulled from so many different countries,
[39:24] there was, you know, a large part of the
[39:26] people who didn't speak Polish, so they
[39:27] would translate in English. And then
[39:29] there was simultaneous translations
[39:31] going over all over the all over the
[39:33] sanctuary. They were translating into
[39:34] Russian. They were translating in
[39:36] Hungarian. They were translating in I
[39:37] think the Romanian as well, all at the
[39:40] same time. And so Cornelius has got
[39:43] starting to get his feet wet in the
[39:44] translation work. So it was nice to see
[39:46] him active there. This is brother
[39:49] Andreas Ring. And if you'll remember, he
[39:51] stopped by here last year and we enjoyed
[39:52] his visit very much. He told me he would
[39:54] come again, so we're trying to work on
[39:57] uh maybe services at the end of the year
[39:59] with him, but we'll see if we can set a
[40:01] date. But I really enjoyed his
[40:03] fellowship once again. The time he came
[40:05] here was the first time that him and I
[40:07] had had a chance to meet and fellowship,
[40:08] and I enjoyed it. And so when I found
[40:11] out that he was going to be there, I was
[40:13] also really excited because I'd hear get
[40:16] to hear him preach again, and it was a
[40:18] blessing for me. And uh I was nervous
[40:21] because I had to start the meetings. I
[40:22] don't like starting
[40:24] meetings. In fact, I don't really like
[40:26] preaching meetings. There's a lot of
[40:28] pressure behind meetings and and but I
[40:31] don't like starting them. So I had to do
[40:33] Thursday night cuz he was traveling down
[40:35] from Germany. There was no way he could
[40:36] do it. And so he was there and at the
[40:39] end of the service he come and he told
[40:41] me, "Brother Chad," he said, "you made
[40:42] it so easy for me to follow. The thought
[40:44] that I had fits right in." And I was so
[40:46] relieved because I just didn't want to
[40:47] mess him up. but he did a fantastic job
[40:50] and really really enjoyed him and so
[40:54] sister Zabella has a good pastor and
[40:57] brother Andreas and she's really happy
[40:59] to talk to her. she came to these
[41:00] meetings. So, we got to visit with her,
[41:02] too. And uh like one of the brothers
[41:04] said, the Abbott family was there and we
[41:06] had a good fellowship with them. And it
[41:08] was just uh really nice to see all of
[41:10] them. And you know, brother Samuel, he's
[41:13] been here and preached a couple times.
[41:14] Brothers son, Samuel Valwalk, and he was
[41:16] a great translator. He's one of the best
[41:18] I've ever worked with. This is him and I
[41:20] here. And they didn't they they didn't
[41:22] have a they had a whiteboard for me. So,
[41:24] I stole that from the Sunday school, I
[41:26] think, and and we did a few drawings.
[41:28] who had a wonderful time, good meetings.
[41:31] Our brothers shared a few song specials
[41:34] and so Josiah did one, played the piano
[41:36] and sang and they all three did two of
[41:38] them together and it was a real
[41:40] blessing. I was really blessed and they
[41:42] they sang the road to Emmas before the
[41:45] last service that I preached and it was
[41:47] such a fitting song for the service that
[41:49] came and so I really was proud of our
[41:51] brothers. You know, whenever somebody
[41:54] goes uh on a trip and goes to another
[41:56] church, they really represent the whole
[41:59] body and they're a representation of us.
[42:02] When our ministers travel and when
[42:03] anybody else travels, they represent all
[42:05] of us. And I can say I was honored to
[42:07] have them as a representation of us.
[42:09] They they carried themselves well. They
[42:12] they they're they're fun when it's time
[42:14] to be fun. They're serious when it's
[42:15] time to be serious. They know they they
[42:18] know how to respect and honor God in his
[42:20] word. and they know how to have a good
[42:21] time and enjoy fellowship and they just
[42:24] did a wonderful job and and I was really
[42:26] proud of them the whole time and not
[42:28] proud in a bad way. I was proud in a
[42:30] good way. If you can be proud in a good
[42:32] way, I was proud in a good way, but I
[42:34] was really proud of them. And then
[42:35] here's the Sunday school kids doing a
[42:37] song about the scarecrow and how you
[42:39] find they they put the words up in
[42:41] English. They sang it in Polish. Well,
[42:42] then they sang a verse, I think, a
[42:44] course in English, but it was about how
[42:46] you got to go past the scarecrow to get
[42:48] the good food.
[42:50] That was a good song. I liked it. And so
[42:53] it was good. We had a ministers meeting
[42:55] one afternoon there. So that's the group
[42:57] of ministers there. They caught a
[42:59] picture. You can see down in the front
[43:00] is brother Simon Abbott and the brothers
[43:02] there. We had a nice time. Enjoyed them.
[43:05] And then this is a picture outside of
[43:07] the whole camp. Everybody and um packed
[43:10] in there. Here's a shot of one of the
[43:13] streets down the Awitz concentration
[43:15] camp. Brother Yatsik had arranged for
[43:17] all three of the young men to be able to
[43:19] go on their way to Krakow the way to
[43:21] leave and they went through Awitz and um
[43:25] you know it's to I was really happy they
[43:27] had the opportunity to go. You can't say
[43:29] that it's fun. It's not fun. It's not
[43:31] pleasant but I think it's important.
[43:34] It's an important experience because
[43:36] when you go you can see what an
[43:38] anointing can do to people
[43:41] and what an evil anointing is capable
[43:44] of. Yeah. Yeah. Because even one of the
[43:47] brothers was sharing with me in the back
[43:49] there. They can't imagine human beings
[43:52] can do that to other human beings. And I
[43:55] said, "But that's what an that's what a
[43:57] spiritual anointing can do. It can push
[43:59] you past your natural barriers."
[44:02] But if an evil anointing will do that,
[44:04] what will the Holy Ghost do? It can push
[44:06] you through your natural human barriers
[44:09] into the good. And so it was a good
[44:11] experience. Brother Brennan calls this,
[44:13] you know, an amateur tribulation
[44:14] tribulation amateur form. It was the it
[44:17] was the opening of the sixth seal and
[44:19] it's just an important experience and
[44:21] they were so close to it. It was a
[44:24] privilege for them to be able to go and
[44:25] experience that and so they all want to
[44:27] give a big thank you to brother Yatsk
[44:29] for making that possible for them and
[44:31] for brother Nathan for driving them. So
[44:33] then they went to the airport. Uh the
[44:36] next day they flew home and uh I went
[44:40] that following day when they flew home
[44:42] and I went to um uh Ukraine. And so this
[44:46] is my first time being in Ukraine. We
[44:48] dropped down through Slovakia. I drove
[44:50] through Slovakia down into Ukraine. And
[44:52] I was as far west as you could possibly
[44:54] go in Ukraine. So I wasn't near any
[44:57] fighting. I was in a place that hadn't
[44:58] never been bombed or shelled or had
[45:00] rockets. Um, but I was still in Ukraine
[45:04] and it was it was an interesting
[45:05] experience. Here's a picture of the
[45:07] group in Usuzar. It was Ushugar uh
[45:10] Ukraine, right on the SL Slovakian
[45:13] border. And uh when I got there, I was
[45:16] talking to these brothers and uh they
[45:18] were telling me that in 2000, the first
[45:21] convention they ever had in 2000 was
[45:23] with brother Lonnie Jenkins. Brother
[45:25] Lonnie, Brother Eugene Braun, and
[45:28] Brother Jason Watkins all came in the
[45:30] year 2000. And so our church has been
[45:32] connected to this church for so long.
[45:34] And I vaguely remember pictures from
[45:37] back then. But and um uh the brother
[45:40] with his hand on my shoulder just back
[45:42] behind me to the left there is brother
[45:45] Vladik. He's the pastor there and he was
[45:47] the pastor then when uh those brothers
[45:50] went. And so we've been linked to this
[45:52] church for so long. It was so nice after
[45:54] 25 years to get reconnected once again.
[45:58] So, we had a just a wonderful time. But
[46:01] while I was there, you know, we've known
[46:03] that the war has been raging in Ukraine
[46:05] for so long. And when it first broke
[46:06] out, we were so
[46:09] uh affected for our our brothers and
[46:11] sisters, praying for them and all that,
[46:13] but then things kind of quiet down and
[46:15] stabilized a bit. And so, didn't really
[46:17] know what was going on. But as we sat
[46:19] and fellowshipped, they began to tell us
[46:21] that the situation is still very uh
[46:24] terrible. It's very grave. They're
[46:27] losing a thousand men a
[46:31] day. A day. I said, "There's no way."
[46:35] They said, "Their quota for new soldiers
[46:37] is 30,000 a month.
[46:42] They're they're taking men if if you're
[46:46] over 18 and under 60, you're eligible
[46:49] for military service unless you have a
[46:50] medical condition or you have three or
[46:52] more children. So the brothers, even in
[46:55] Ushar, which is as far away from the
[46:57] fighting as you can get in
[46:59] Ukraine, they can't go out on the
[47:01] streets. They can't go in public because
[47:04] if they're out in public, they could be
[47:06] stopped by the police, stopped by
[47:07] military. They could be taken and forced
[47:10] into military service. I was speaking
[47:12] with a brother there who had been taken
[47:14] and been forced into military
[47:16] service and they took him and he was at
[47:20] work. He was doing something for work
[47:21] and uh they came and and they took him
[47:24] and they drove him around and they tried
[47:26] to get him to to participate and he told
[47:29] him he refused. He goes, "I won't hold a
[47:30] gun." He goes, "I won't kill anybody."
[47:33] He told me he was a Christian. And so
[47:36] they tried to break him. They tried to
[47:37] get him to sign papers because if you
[47:39] sign with consent, they have a lot more
[47:41] that they can do. He refused to sign
[47:43] anything. They can still force you into
[47:44] military service, but they're limited.
[47:46] So he wouldn't sign anything. So it was
[47:48] quite an ordeal. Quite And I don't want
[47:50] to try to retell it because I won't
[47:51] retell it accurately, but quite an
[47:53] ordeal. And they then they tried to make
[47:55] him a chaplain because he was a
[47:56] Christian. And he says, "I can't be a
[47:59] chaplain." He says, "Why now?" He says,
[48:01] "Cuz you tell your you tell your
[48:03] chaplain tell your people it's okay to
[48:05] kill." And he goes, "I won't tell them
[48:08] that." And so eventually they sent him
[48:12] to the front lines and made him go out
[48:14] in the battlefield at night and collect
[48:16] dead
[48:17] bodies. And so it was just horrific. And
[48:21] uh by the grace of God, he was able to
[48:23] get out of that. And he's he's he's uh
[48:25] free from that now. But when you hear
[48:28] stories like that, you realize it's not
[48:30] over for them. It may not be daily in
[48:32] the news for us. We may not realize, but
[48:35] all the women have to go out and do the
[48:37] shopping. All the sisters have to go
[48:38] out. They they can't openly go out and
[48:42] just walk down the road. They can't
[48:44] leave their towns because there's
[48:45] military checkpoints on every highway in
[48:48] and out of cities. They can't cross the
[48:49] border. They can't leave home. They
[48:51] can't They're so limited in what they
[48:53] can do if they're within those ages of
[48:55] services. Even the pastor's son, brother
[48:59] Vladic's son, has a med medical
[49:01] condition. He has a medical release and
[49:03] he's got a card showing he's not
[49:04] medically fit for service. So, he was
[49:07] free and he was uh uh walking on the
[49:10] roads in their city and he got picked up
[49:12] and he got they tried to force him
[49:14] because they're so short in people. Can
[49:16] you imagine losing a thousand people a
[49:18] day? You're losing a whole generation.
[49:21] Yeah. There's so many there's going to
[49:23] be so many widows in Ukraine.
[49:26] There's going to be so many children
[49:27] that are fatherless. There's going to be
[49:29] so many young women that don't there's
[49:31] not enough men to marry. There's going
[49:33] to be a whole generation affected by
[49:34] this in a very serious way. And so for
[49:38] me, it was just it was like a reality
[49:39] check for me cuz we're so insulated from
[49:42] these things. We can so quickly stop
[49:44] thinking about them. And you know, I
[49:47] don't say that so you feel guilty. I I
[49:49] was the same way. I felt like, "Oh my
[49:51] goodness, I can't believe I stopped
[49:53] praying for our brothers and sisters. I
[49:55] I didn't realize what the situation
[49:57] was." But now I'm just really asking the
[50:00] Lord to protect them, to watch over all
[50:03] of them. And the thing is they they'll
[50:05] they'll still risk coming to church.
[50:07] They'll get in a car and come to church
[50:09] because, you know, they can't come in
[50:11] private property and take them. So if
[50:12] they're in the church, they're okay. If
[50:13] they're at home, they're okay. In
[50:15] between, you know, it's a little risky,
[50:17] but they'll still come. They'll still
[50:19] sing. they're still happy. They still
[50:21] love the word. And in church, you know,
[50:23] you would never know that they got this
[50:25] struggle in their life. And so, we had
[50:27] wonderful time there. I was there uh
[50:29] stayed in the pastor's home. We were
[50:31] there three nights. I had two services,
[50:33] a Tuesday night and a Wednesday night
[50:35] service. But really, it left an
[50:37] impression on my heart. And I really
[50:39] love those brothers. And and just if you
[50:41] could remember to pray for the saints in
[50:43] Ukraine, and not just the saints, every
[50:45] human being that has to live in Ukraine.
[50:48] Maybe if we just pray, God will do
[50:50] something to stop that war because it's
[50:53] horrific.
[50:55] Amen.
[50:57] Then uh we uh woke up on Thursday and
[51:01] then uh we left Thursday to go to a
[51:04] second uh convention. So the first
[51:06] convention was the one Brother Yatsik
[51:07] and his church had uh organized. Then we
[51:10] dropped down and went to Uscar, Ukraine.
[51:13] And then we drove back up into Poland.
[51:15] And this convention is like six hours
[51:17] away from the first one. It's on the
[51:19] opposite end of Poland on the southern
[51:20] side. And so, Brother Bogdan from Villa
[51:24] Petrova is the pastor there. And he he
[51:27] he and his church and a sister church
[51:28] organized that. So, here's a picture uh
[51:32] from the back of the main hall. They had
[51:35] they have a a campground and they have
[51:37] this main hall that holds as many people
[51:39] as it can. Then there's another hall
[51:41] just like this, the next level down, and
[51:43] that's the overflow. So it was half full
[51:45] of people. Then there's another one on
[51:47] the level below that. This is the fourth
[51:48] floor. On the second floor, that's for
[51:51] mothers with children and babies. And so
[51:53] they had this building stacked up with
[51:55] people. So it was interesting. Amen. It
[51:58] was quite nice. And then uh brother John
[52:01] Andy's was there. So he was ministering
[52:03] there as well. He took the first
[52:05] service. It was really nice because I
[52:06] had traveled from Ukraine all that day.
[52:08] Didn't get to the campground till 3 and
[52:10] the service is 4:30. So he preached that
[52:13] opening service. And so it was really
[52:15] nice to have his help there because I'd
[52:16] already had a lot of services and coming
[52:18] to that camp would have been five or six
[52:20] services, but he took two of them for
[52:22] me. So I took three and he really helped
[52:25] shoulder the burden. So I was thankful
[52:27] to see him, thankful to have his help.
[52:29] Then we had another guest that come
[52:30] down. We had a friend that drove down,
[52:33] Brother Vitali. So, brother Vitali drove
[52:35] down from Lithuania and uh we went out
[52:38] to dinner one night and he loaned me his
[52:40] coat and hat because it was cold. And
[52:42] so, my wife's probably looking at that
[52:44] goes, "Where did that coat come from?
[52:45] Where' that hat come from?" But I I it
[52:48] was borrowed. I had to give it back. It
[52:50] was a nice coat, too. I hated to give it
[52:53] back. But, uh I got a little video here
[52:56] of the worship.
[52:58] [Applause]
[52:58] [Music]
[53:19] Oh,
[53:22] heat,
[53:24] heat.
[53:25] [Music]
[53:34] Yeah. Heat.
[53:39] [Music]
[53:42] [Applause]
[53:45] [Music]
[53:53] Amen. Had trumpet player, cello, violin,
[53:58] uh accordion. They were all there and it
[54:01] was good. I enjoyed it. So, we had a
[54:03] nice time and I I really enjoyed uh
[54:07] being there and getting to see the
[54:08] saints again and it was a real privilege
[54:10] for me. I came back with a uh a few
[54:14] gifts for the assembly. First and
[54:17] foremost, we haven't forgot the candy
[54:19] for the Sunday school kids. So, Brother
[54:21] Nathan Merur actually sent some
[54:23] chocolate back. So, Brother Nathan sent
[54:25] some chocolate from Poland. So, it's out
[54:28] on the table in the forer when you get
[54:31] done. Uh the kids, remember this is for
[54:34] Sunday school kids. All right? If
[54:37] there's any leftover, I guess some
[54:38] adults can have some. But the the kids
[54:40] get the children get to go first. Amen.
[54:42] And we'll have a deacon watching. And
[54:45] tell me if the deacon has chocolate on
[54:47] his teeth. I want to know. I want to
[54:49] know. So, and then also there's some
[54:53] little hard candies out there. There was
[54:54] a sister from Hungary and I was talking
[54:57] to her and her husband and she gave me
[54:59] some little boxes of hard candy from
[55:02] Hungary. So, there's some Hungarian hard
[55:03] candy and there's some uh Polish
[55:05] chocolate out there for all the Sunday
[55:07] school kids. So, you get to eat the same
[55:09] candy they eat in Poland and in uh
[55:12] Hungary. Amen. So, we met so many saints
[55:16] from so many places. Some that we've met
[55:18] before, some Hungarian believers that we
[55:19] knew for a while from being in Hungary,
[55:21] some new ones uh from Germany, from
[55:25] Romania, from Serbia, from everywhere.
[55:31] But it was really nice and they all send
[55:33] greetings. I mean, everyone wants us to
[55:36] say hello and I it's impossible. But I
[55:40] can say for sure, brother Yatsk and his
[55:42] church sent greetings. Brother Nathan
[55:43] Missou for sure. Brother Samuel Vwok,
[55:46] uh, brother Cornelius, uh, brother
[55:49] Bogdan from Villa Petrova, the pastor
[55:51] there. Uh, the brothers from Garod
[55:54] wanted me to give you a special greeting
[55:56] uh, because of those meetings from so
[55:58] long ago being connected to the church.
[56:00] Brother Vitali Sokov and also brother
[56:02] Pavo Steano he came to the first camp so
[56:05] and brother Dimma also was there so they
[56:08] all sent special greetings and so it was
[56:11] nice to have them also I got a couple uh
[56:16] new books printed the believers in and
[56:18] brother Yatsi's church they print um
[56:21] English message books so when Voice of
[56:24] God quit printing the books there was
[56:26] still a great need in the African
[56:27] country for books so they took up the
[56:29] responsibility ability to print. And so
[56:31] they print the books in English and then
[56:33] brother Andreas Ringan's church ships
[56:35] them out because he lives up on the
[56:37] coast. So they they take them by vehicle
[56:39] and and uh trailer up to brother
[56:41] Andreas. Andreas puts them on skids,
[56:44] wraps them up, and they ship them to all
[56:46] kinds of countries. So he sent me a
[56:48] suitcase full. Uh well, small suitcase
[56:51] full, but I've got Countdown and The
[56:54] Seed of Discrepancy. So those are two
[56:55] titles that we don't have in our
[56:57] library. Uh, I didn't I wasn't able to
[56:59] carry much. I only got 50 of each. So,
[57:01] we'll start the
[57:03] bidding now. Dollar dollar, $2,
[57:06] $3. No, just kidding. I'll give them to
[57:10] brother uh John Pittenber and he'll put
[57:12] them in the rack back here by the door.
[57:14] So, maybe uh uh by this weekend, we'll
[57:17] start having those on the rack and you
[57:19] can help yourself to them. Also, they
[57:21] sent some more of the um uh bookmarks
[57:25] that they like to send for witnessing or
[57:27] you can use them for yourself. They're
[57:28] out there and they got these witnessing
[57:30] cards now of the candalabra with the
[57:32] seven church ages and the cloud in the
[57:34] back. Those are out there on the welcome
[57:36] desk as well. Then I got two new
[57:38] coloring books for the kids. So, these
[57:42] are little coloring books. There's a
[57:43] sister somewhere in Poland in a
[57:45] different church. She goes and puts
[57:47] together the graphics and they tie them
[57:48] together with a story that Brother
[57:49] Brandham tells. And so I was only able
[57:52] to get 50 of each. So just all the kids
[57:56] who are coloring and enjoy coloring. The
[57:58] kids who enjoy coloring, we're I put
[58:02] these in the library. So sister Elsie
[58:04] will find them back at her desk in the
[58:06] library. She can have them available in
[58:07] the library. So Sunday you can start
[58:09] picking those up as well. So it's so
[58:11] much fun to come home with gifts. And
[58:13] those are all compliments from brother
[58:15] Yasik and his church, the assembly
[58:16] there. So we really appreciate them for
[58:21] that. Amen. Let's all stand together. I
[58:24] just want to share a couple scriptures
[58:26] and just a short thought and then we'll
[58:29] wrap it up for the evening. Let's go to
[58:30] 1 Corinthians chapter
[58:37] 12. God bless you, brother Paul and
[58:39] Sister Norah Jane. It's good to have
[58:40] you. It's good to see you.
[58:45] Amen. 1
[58:48] Corinthians chapter
[58:55] 12 and verse 12.
[58:59] 12:12. For as the body is one and hath
[59:02] many members, and all the members of
[59:04] that one body being many, are one body,
[59:07] so also is Christ. For by one spirit are
[59:10] we all baptized into one body, whether
[59:12] we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be
[59:15] bond or free, and have been all made to
[59:17] drink unto one spirit. For the body is
[59:20] not one member, but many. May God bless
[59:23] you as you take your seats. May the Lord
[59:26] bless us as we look into his word.
[59:28] Now, man, I just want to tell you that I
[59:31] I want to thank you all for praying for
[59:33] us. Uh it's been uh it's been felt and
[59:36] we got many texts. I got I received many
[59:39] texts from you and I know I know many of
[59:41] you were praying. You told us you'd be
[59:42] praying before. You told us since we got
[59:44] back you sent text and I know some whole
[59:47] families were praying. So I appreciate
[59:48] all even all the little children who
[59:50] were praying for us. And we certainly
[59:52] felt the prayers certainly appreciate
[59:54] the support of this assembly and all
[59:56] that we do. We couldn't do what we do
[59:58] without each other. There's no way. And
[1:00:02] uh just want to share with you just a
[1:00:04] personal testimony from me. I've been
[1:00:07] busy this last month, busier than I ever
[1:00:10] like to be. I usually don't plan trips
[1:00:11] close together. And I don't like to be
[1:00:14] gone as long as I was this last time.
[1:00:16] It's not typical for me, but we went to
[1:00:19] Arizona there at the beginning of May or
[1:00:22] it was at the beginning of April. And
[1:00:24] then here at the end of April to the
[1:00:26] beginning of May, I was there in Poland.
[1:00:28] So those trips were close together. Was
[1:00:30] busy in between. It's been a busy time.
[1:00:32] But I just want to say the last six,
[1:00:34] seven weeks has been a real time of
[1:00:36] personal growth for me. It's been a real
[1:00:38] blessed time for me. The Lord's just
[1:00:40] every once in a while things, you know,
[1:00:43] you go through seasons in life. There's
[1:00:44] seasons in everything. There's testing
[1:00:47] times and there's rewarding times and
[1:00:48] there's planting times and there's
[1:00:50] harvest times. Everything has cycles and
[1:00:52] everything has times in life. And
[1:00:54] brother Rem tells us that there's cycles
[1:00:56] to everything. And so I just been really
[1:00:59] rejoicing in the Lord over the last six
[1:01:00] to seven weeks because it's been for me
[1:01:03] a real time of spiritual growth
[1:01:05] personally and a real time of
[1:01:07] revelation. And it's been exciting to me
[1:01:09] the way the revelation is coming. It
[1:01:12] it's it's I don't know how to explain
[1:01:14] it. It's just
[1:01:16] revelation. It's just a deeper deep, you
[1:01:18] know, it's a higher height and a deeper
[1:01:20] deep. And it's and it's something that's
[1:01:22] really personal to me and something the
[1:01:24] Lord's been doing deep inside of me. and
[1:01:27] the services that we've been having uh
[1:01:29] you know starting in Arizona and then in
[1:01:33] the meetings that we just came from. I
[1:01:35] just had nine services in just a short
[1:01:37] amount of time which is a heavy load but
[1:01:40] I can say that the Lord was with us.
[1:01:42] Amen. And it was quite a blessing and I
[1:01:44] was blessed myself with the word like
[1:01:46] the word that was that was coming the
[1:01:48] word the inspiration was a blessing to
[1:01:50] me. I was feeding on it as I was
[1:01:53] preaching. Amen. And so I was really
[1:01:56] appreciated the those who had
[1:01:59] anticipation, those who were pulling the
[1:02:01] atmosphere in the meetings. It was all
[1:02:04] wonderful. But for me personally, it was
[1:02:06] a great time of encouragement. And so I
[1:02:09] just appreciate you all being patient
[1:02:11] with me as I go. Like I said, I don't
[1:02:13] normally schedule meetings that close
[1:02:14] together. I don't normally like to be
[1:02:16] gone from home that much. We had to
[1:02:18] cancel two communions, which I don't
[1:02:19] remember ever cancing two communions in
[1:02:21] a row. So it's been an odd time. It's
[1:02:23] been unusual. I felt comfortable going.
[1:02:26] I felt led of the Lord. But I can see
[1:02:28] there's fruit of it for me in my own
[1:02:30] life. I also would like to share too
[1:02:33] that I I believe, you know, I've gotten
[1:02:35] to travel. I've gotten to go places and
[1:02:37] see some things. And every time that I
[1:02:40] go on a trip, to me, there's always a
[1:02:43] blessing. There's always something that
[1:02:46] I gain, something that I pick up,
[1:02:48] something that I learn, something I see,
[1:02:50] something I experience that I believe is
[1:02:52] good for all of us. Amen. Because we're
[1:02:54] we're one body. Not just the local body,
[1:02:57] but we're one body worldwide.
[1:03:00] And it's so nice sometimes to go see and
[1:03:02] visit and learn from another part of the
[1:03:04] body. And maybe not even learning things
[1:03:07] that you could write down on a piece of
[1:03:09] paper and say, "We're going to come home
[1:03:10] and do that." But it's not that kind of
[1:03:12] learning. It's it's being fed from
[1:03:14] another part of the body. And it's
[1:03:16] enhancing your life and deepening your
[1:03:18] experience. And and it's it's an
[1:03:21] encouragement. It's a challenge. It's
[1:03:23] It's so many different things that take
[1:03:25] place. It's really hard to put it into
[1:03:27] words. You can probably ask the young
[1:03:28] brothers that go and try to get them to
[1:03:30] explain it, but you can't explain it.
[1:03:32] It's just something's pouring back into
[1:03:33] you. There's an experience of meeting
[1:03:35] these brothers and sisters uh that
[1:03:37] you've never met before and connecting
[1:03:39] to them in a deep way almost instantly.
[1:03:42] Learning from them and growing and
[1:03:44] having that experience is is so
[1:03:48] beneficial. And uh you know so this
[1:03:51] evening I just want to talk a little bit
[1:03:53] about the word fellowship. The word
[1:03:55] fellowship and brother Benham says in
[1:03:58] the end times uh sign seed he said it's
[1:04:00] always a blessing wherever you go and
[1:04:02] meet God's people. It's a blessing
[1:04:04] everywhere. Amen. It's a blessing here.
[1:04:07] It's a blessing state side. It's a
[1:04:09] blessing overseas. Wherever you go and
[1:04:11] you meet God's people it's a blessing.
[1:04:14] And in God's provided way of approach to
[1:04:18] fellowship, he says fellowship around
[1:04:20] the world, there's something great about
[1:04:22] it. Man loves to fellowship even to the
[1:04:25] unconverted man. So there's something in
[1:04:28] us that craves fellowship and longs for
[1:04:30] fellowship. And it's actually a part of
[1:04:32] our Christian
[1:04:33] experience because God never never meant
[1:04:36] for us to be in
[1:04:37] isolation. I say man is a paradox,
[1:04:41] right? And even our Christian walk
[1:04:43] sometimes a paradox because there's a
[1:04:44] part of your Christian life that is
[1:04:46] personal, intimate, and nobody else has
[1:04:49] any part in it. Even if you're married
[1:04:52] and really close to your spouse, there's
[1:04:54] a relationship you have with Christ that
[1:04:56] your spouse can't even enter in with
[1:04:57] you. It's just you and the Lord. But
[1:05:01] yet, so we're we're eagles. We fly high
[1:05:04] and we fly solo and we go, but we're
[1:05:07] sheep.
[1:05:09] So, are you an eagle or are you a sheep?
[1:05:11] You know, this is the paradox to
[1:05:13] Christian walk. There's a part of our
[1:05:15] experience that is so uh intimate and
[1:05:18] it's so uh individual and it's just us
[1:05:21] and God. But there's a part of our walk
[1:05:23] that's so community
[1:05:25] that's so you know sheep in a fold
[1:05:27] that's so part uh of one another and
[1:05:30] interdependent upon one another. It's
[1:05:33] like truly like a body that every part
[1:05:35] of my body is dependent on every other
[1:05:37] part of my body. And that's what the way
[1:05:39] we are as the body of Christ. And I
[1:05:41] started looking at fellowship and I've
[1:05:44] mentioned this here before, but
[1:05:46] fellowship especially like what we've
[1:05:47] experienced traveling so far away in uh
[1:05:51] in such an effort and so much time and
[1:05:53] such
[1:05:54] distance, you know, it's it's quite an
[1:05:57] endeavor. But I looked through the book
[1:05:59] of Acts and I looked at the uh New
[1:06:01] Testament church and they were always
[1:06:03] doing that. That's always been part of
[1:06:06] the church. That kind of fellowship,
[1:06:07] going from church to church and moving
[1:06:09] about and connecting to one another,
[1:06:11] that's always been part of the church.
[1:06:14] That's y'all just knew as travel got
[1:06:16] easier. No, it was there when travel was
[1:06:18] difficult. I want to look at a couple
[1:06:21] scriptures. Let's go to Acts chapter 15
[1:06:23] together.
[1:06:27] Because what I want to look at is how
[1:06:29] instrumental or how important this was
[1:06:32] to the church to the New Testament
[1:06:34] church because it's embedded in the life
[1:06:36] of the church. Acts
[1:06:41] 15:36 and some days after Paul said unto
[1:06:44] Barnabas, "Let us go again and visit our
[1:06:46] brethren in every city where we have
[1:06:48] preached the word of the Lord and see
[1:06:50] how they do." This is Paul and Barnabas
[1:06:52] had made their first missionary journey.
[1:06:54] Amen. And they had come back and they
[1:06:56] were at Antioch and they had given a
[1:06:57] report and listen they they they gave
[1:07:00] trip reports. Yes. Because they come
[1:07:03] back to Antioch and they told them all
[1:07:04] and then they all rejoiced and they went
[1:07:06] up to Jerusalem one time and told them
[1:07:07] all that had happened in Gentiles and
[1:07:09] they all rejoiced.
[1:07:11] So even testimonies from trips isn't
[1:07:13] new. It's part of the New Testament.
[1:07:16] Traveling Mount visiting the believers,
[1:07:17] that's part of the New Testament. So
[1:07:19] here Paul and Barnabas after they're
[1:07:21] back at Antioch spending some time and
[1:07:23] all of a sudden Paul's like, "Man,
[1:07:25] Barnabas, let's go back and see
[1:07:27] everybody and see how they're doing."
[1:07:30] Amen. That's always been a desire in the
[1:07:33] church. You know, not everybody in
[1:07:36] Antioch got to go to Asia Minor, but
[1:07:40] when they came back and gave the report,
[1:07:41] everybody in Antioch rejoiced. Amen.
[1:07:44] Amen. Because there's different parts of
[1:07:45] the body and things that we all all do.
[1:07:48] But I I rejoice every time somebody
[1:07:50] comes back and tells us, you know, the
[1:07:52] last time, you know, uh, Brother Ron and
[1:07:54] brother John went and come back from the
[1:07:56] Philippines and meeting the brothers and
[1:07:58] sisters again in Japan. I rejoice. It
[1:08:01] was good to hear. I I I loved it. And
[1:08:03] it's so good for us as a body to stay
[1:08:06] interconnected with other bodies, to
[1:08:08] recognize what God's doing in other
[1:08:10] parts of the world, to rub shoulders, to
[1:08:12] connect, to go and and bring back
[1:08:14] reports and touch base. It's it's so
[1:08:17] healthy uh for us as an assembly, for us
[1:08:20] as individuals as well.
[1:08:23] Uh let's go to Romans chapter 1. I just
[1:08:26] want to hit a couple of these spots.
[1:08:28] Certainly not exhaustive. We there's
[1:08:30] much more we could read, but just want
[1:08:32] to read a few spots. Romans chapter
[1:08:38] 1:9. For God is my witness whom I serve
[1:08:41] with my spirit in the gospel of his son.
[1:08:43] that without ceasing I make mention of
[1:08:45] you always in my prayers making request
[1:08:47] if by any means now at length I might
[1:08:49] have a prosperous journey by the will of
[1:08:51] God to come unto you for I long to see
[1:08:54] you that I may impart unto you some
[1:08:56] spiritual gift to the end you may be
[1:08:59] established that is that I may be
[1:09:01] comforted together with you by the
[1:09:03] mutual faith both of you and of me so
[1:09:06] Paul wanted to see him and impart some
[1:09:08] spiritual gifts but he also wanted to
[1:09:10] have fellowship and he wanted to be
[1:09:14] comforted. I I just love the way he says
[1:09:16] this. That I might let me find my place
[1:09:19] again. That I may be comforted together
[1:09:22] with you by the mutual faith both of you
[1:09:25] and me. He said, I just want to connect
[1:09:27] with you on faith and we'll both have
[1:09:29] comfort.
[1:09:31] That's what happens in
[1:09:33] fellowship. Let's go to second
[1:09:38] Corinthians. 2 Corinthians chapter 7.
[1:09:46] 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:09:51] 7:13 Therefore we were comforted in your
[1:09:54] comfort. Yay. And exceedingly the more
[1:09:56] joyed we were for the for the joy of
[1:09:59] Titus because his spirit was refreshed
[1:10:01] by you all. Here's Paul saying, "Titus
[1:10:05] went and visited you and Titus come back
[1:10:08] and told us how you're doing and we are
[1:10:10] so comforted in spirit because Titus was
[1:10:13] refreshed by his visit with you." So,
[1:10:15] here's Paul didn't even go, but Paul got
[1:10:18] the benefit by Titus going and coming
[1:10:20] back and saying how the believers are
[1:10:22] doing. Amen. I love it. Amen. Amen. So,
[1:10:26] I think we're learning that this isn't
[1:10:27] new. This has been going on. Let's look
[1:10:30] at second Timothy.
[1:10:32] just jump over to second Timothy
[1:10:36] 4 and and I can tell you this is all
[1:10:38] through the New Testament, all through
[1:10:40] the writings of Paul, all through the
[1:10:42] book of Acts, but second Timothy
[1:10:47] um 4, 2 Timothy
[1:10:50] 4 and verse
[1:10:53] 9, do thy diligence to come shortly unto
[1:10:56] me, for Demoth hath forsaken me, having
[1:10:59] loved this present world, and is
[1:11:01] departed marted into
[1:11:02] Thessalonica, Cresence to Galatia, Titus
[1:11:05] unto Dalatia. Now, Cresence, he didn't
[1:11:09] leave the
[1:11:11] faith. Titus didn't leave the faith.
[1:11:13] Only Deeus left Paul. But what he's he's
[1:11:17] giving a report to Timothy and he's
[1:11:18] saying, "Listen, Deeus has forsaken me.
[1:11:21] But Cresence, he went to Galatia. Titus,
[1:11:25] he went to Dalatia. Only Luke is with
[1:11:27] me. Take Mark and bring him with thee,
[1:11:30] for he is profitable to me in the
[1:11:31] ministry. And Ty Tyas have I sent to
[1:11:36] Ephesus and the cloak that I left at
[1:11:38] Traz with Corpus when thou comest bring
[1:11:41] with thee in the books, but especially
[1:11:43] the parchments. So what's he saying?
[1:11:45] He's saying, listen, I need you to come
[1:11:47] to me because cresence went to to to
[1:11:51] Galatia and then uh Titus, he went here
[1:11:54] and then I sent Taikas over to Ephesus.
[1:11:56] And when you stopped by Trrowaz, there
[1:11:58] was a brother I was visiting there and
[1:11:59] left my coat. Bring the coat in the
[1:12:00] parchment and come to me and bring Mark
[1:12:02] because I need Mark here. They were
[1:12:04] going there and coming here and going
[1:12:06] there and Paul's sending them to Ephesus
[1:12:08] and bringing them here and bringing them
[1:12:09] back. They're they're they're visiting
[1:12:11] each other. The ministry is traveling.
[1:12:14] The saints are traveling. Amen. When
[1:12:16] Paul had a need, he had he got a visit
[1:12:18] from those uh in Macedonia who brought
[1:12:20] an offering to him to support his needs
[1:12:22] that he had in his missionary endeavor
[1:12:24] in another city.
[1:12:26] They were always visiting each other.
[1:12:28] They were always ministers moving back
[1:12:30] and forth by the direction of Paul, by
[1:12:32] their own direction. Amen. You have
[1:12:33] Aquill and Priscilla who left Italy.
[1:12:36] Amen. And then they they came over uh uh
[1:12:38] to to uh uh I think it was Ephesus. And
[1:12:42] in Ephes, no, in Corinth. And in
[1:12:45] Corenth, they get a hold of Apollos. And
[1:12:47] Apollos, they show him the way of life
[1:12:49] more perfectly because he was in
[1:12:50] Ephesus. And then he went to Ephesus.
[1:12:52] Then he went to Corinth. And you find
[1:12:53] Apollus in two or three different
[1:12:55] locations preaching the gospel. You find
[1:12:57] Aquill and Priscilla in a couple
[1:12:59] different places preaching the gospel.
[1:13:03] It's amazing
[1:13:04] things that we think are are are just
[1:13:07] part of our generation. We realize this
[1:13:09] is the New Testament church.
[1:13:12] This is why we love to visit our
[1:13:15] brothers and sisters. This is why we
[1:13:17] love uh to hear what's going on abroad.
[1:13:20] This is why we love to hear what's going
[1:13:21] on in the missionary field. what we love
[1:13:23] to hear in established works. We love to
[1:13:24] hear what's going on with our brothers
[1:13:26] and sisters because we're one body, one
[1:13:28] family, and we can be comforted and
[1:13:30] refreshed by what's going because God
[1:13:34] built us for fellowship. Let's go back
[1:13:37] to the book of Acts and look at Acts
[1:13:39] chapter
[1:13:44] 2. Fellowship is embedded in our
[1:13:47] Christian experience.
[1:13:49] Acts chapter
[1:13:51] 2 verse
[1:13:58] 41 says, "Then Acts 2 and 41, then they
[1:14:01] that gladly receive his word baptized,
[1:14:04] and the same day were added unto them
[1:14:06] about 3,000 souls, and they continued
[1:14:09] steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and
[1:14:12] fellowship, and in breaking of bread and
[1:14:14] in prayers." So all these new converts
[1:14:17] they started off first thing they do is
[1:14:21] they continued steadfast in the apostles
[1:14:24] doctrine and fellowship and breaking
[1:14:26] bread and in prayers.
[1:14:30] Maybe this is why we always get together
[1:14:31] and eat
[1:14:34] part of the book of acts breaking bread
[1:14:37] fellowshipping spending time in each
[1:14:39] other's homes. This is part of it. This
[1:14:42] word fellowship is interesting word in
[1:14:45] the New Testament. It means a
[1:14:47] fellowship, an association, a community,
[1:14:51] a communion, a joint
[1:14:54] participation. And then another
[1:14:56] definition is the share which one has in
[1:14:58] anything. A participation.
[1:15:02] Fellowship is interesting because
[1:15:06] fellowship is not
[1:15:09] uh one or two people doing everything
[1:15:11] and everybody else coming along for the
[1:15:13] ride. Fellowship is a mutual
[1:15:15] participation.
[1:15:17] Fellowship is an association
[1:15:20] where everyone is involved
[1:15:23] where everyone is a participant where
[1:15:25] everyone is active. It's a community
[1:15:28] where everything gets blended together.
[1:15:31] It's a communion where you commune with
[1:15:33] one another. It's a joint participation.
[1:15:36] It's your share. You have a share in the
[1:15:40] gospel. You have a part in the gospel. A
[1:15:44] share. That's that's what fellowship is.
[1:15:46] Is you have a part. And fellowship is
[1:15:50] actually a mixing
[1:15:52] together. You mixing with me and me
[1:15:55] mixing with you.
[1:15:57] Amen. That's when it comes down to one
[1:16:00] of the words for fellowship is
[1:16:02] intercourse. One of the
[1:16:04] definitions. So a fellowship is this
[1:16:08] mutual
[1:16:11] participation. And fellowship is this uh
[1:16:14] bond that links us but makes us all an
[1:16:16] active participant in this gospel of
[1:16:19] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:21] So, it's so much more than just we said
[1:16:24] hello to each other, but we're actually
[1:16:26] mixing together in this community, in
[1:16:28] this communion, in this act of
[1:16:30] participation in the life of
[1:16:33] Christ. So, it's and it's important and
[1:16:36] it's a part of our Christian experience.
[1:16:38] That's why there's nobody that flies
[1:16:40] solo.
[1:16:41] It doesn't work.
[1:16:44] There's nobody that can just withdraw
[1:16:45] from the body and be spiritually
[1:16:48] healthy. Yeah. Separated from a body of
[1:16:51] fellowship.
[1:16:53] It's it's not part of the scriptures.
[1:16:55] It's not part of the New Testament
[1:16:57] church. God wants us to mix with each
[1:17:00] other, to rub shoulders. He wants iron
[1:17:03] to sharpen iron. He wants us to be
[1:17:05] encouraged by one another. He wants us
[1:17:06] to be challenged by one another.
[1:17:10] Because when you mix in fellowship, you
[1:17:12] don't always just get the good parts.
[1:17:14] Amen.
[1:17:16] There's some rough edges there, too,
[1:17:18] because we're all still stuck in a
[1:17:19] sticky, cockaurn nature, but that's even
[1:17:22] good for us. Amen. Amen. So, we learn
[1:17:26] how to practice brotherly love,
[1:17:28] patience, temperance, and fellowship.
[1:17:30] Amen.
[1:17:32] Amen. I love it. God is so good. His
[1:17:35] plan is so perfect. You say, "I'm tired
[1:17:39] of getting my feelings hurt." Well, God
[1:17:40] designed it that way
[1:17:43] because it's good for us.
[1:17:46] You know, I I I I've been in this
[1:17:48] fellowship and I got hurt and I went to
[1:17:50] this fellowship and I got hurt or or
[1:17:51] these this this family hurt me and I
[1:17:53] switched my friends and they hurt me.
[1:17:55] And I just wish Christian people would
[1:17:58] be Christian
[1:18:00] people. Christian people are just
[1:18:02] people.
[1:18:04] Just people. people that still have, you
[1:18:07] know, rough edges with a cocker burner
[1:18:10] nature with different ideas and
[1:18:12] different viewpoints and different
[1:18:13] experience and there's still Amen.
[1:18:15] There's good fellowship, but there's
[1:18:17] still a little bit of maybe a little
[1:18:18] grind once in a while. And that grind is
[1:18:20] a good thing.
[1:18:22] And we're always running away from the
[1:18:24] grind.
[1:18:26] But the grind is designed
[1:18:28] to shape us.
[1:18:31] Amen. And so if we just learn to
[1:18:33] fellowship on the word, just learn to
[1:18:35] love one another and learn to appreciate
[1:18:37] one another, everything that comes with
[1:18:39] it will be good for us. Trust God's way.
[1:18:43] Trust God's word. Amen. It'll all work
[1:18:46] together for good. But fellowship is is
[1:18:49] is is fundamental not just to the
[1:18:53] Christian church, but to us as human
[1:18:55] beings. Brother Bam said everyone, even
[1:18:57] the unconverted fellowship. He said even
[1:19:00] businessmen like to get together and
[1:19:01] talk about business. He called it a form
[1:19:04] of fellowship in Satan's Eden. He says,
[1:19:06] "And so God knew that we would be here,
[1:19:09] but then he put us in flesh so we would
[1:19:12] be contacted in order he could contact.
[1:19:14] He became one of us when he became Jesus
[1:19:17] Christ, the son of God himself, the
[1:19:19] fullness of the manifestation of God.
[1:19:21] Therefore, that was God's purpose to
[1:19:23] display his attributes and fellowship.
[1:19:26] When I was in my father, I knew nothing
[1:19:27] about it. But when I become his son and
[1:19:29] was born of him, I was an attribute, a
[1:19:31] part of my father, and you're a part of
[1:19:33] your
[1:19:34] father. And as children of God, we are
[1:19:37] part of God's attribute that was in him,
[1:19:39] made flesh like he was made flesh, so we
[1:19:42] can have fellowship one with the other
[1:19:45] as a family of God upon the earth. And
[1:19:47] that was God's purpose at the beginning.
[1:19:50] Yes, sir. That's what God wanted at the
[1:19:53] beginning. So what was God's original
[1:19:56] purpose for bringing man to the earth?
[1:19:59] His original purpose was that that God's
[1:20:02] attributes would be made manifest on the
[1:20:04] earth. And he says it this way that that
[1:20:07] God's attribute that was in him made
[1:20:09] manifest like he was made manifest so so
[1:20:12] we can have fellowship one with the
[1:20:15] other
[1:20:17] as a family of God upon the earth. Amen.
[1:20:21] And that was God's purpose at the
[1:20:23] beginning.
[1:20:25] What was God's purpose? Fellowship.
[1:20:27] Yeah. What did he make man on the earth
[1:20:28] for? Fellowship. Amen. And what did he
[1:20:31] want? His attributes expressed on earth
[1:20:33] together in fellowship. That was his
[1:20:36] purpose at the beginning. That's what
[1:20:37] God wanted. That's why I think that's
[1:20:39] part of man.
[1:20:41] Let's look at First John together. First
[1:20:44] John chapter 1.
[1:20:50] 1 John chapter
[1:20:54] 1 verse
[1:20:57] 5 said this then is the message that we
[1:21:00] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:21:02] that God is light and in him is no
[1:21:04] darkness at all. If we say that we have
[1:21:06] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[1:21:08] we lie and do not the truth. Why is
[1:21:11] that? Because you can't have that
[1:21:13] blending together in darkness. You can't
[1:21:16] have that association, that communion.
[1:21:19] But listen what he says. But if we walk
[1:21:21] in the light as he is in the light, we
[1:21:23] have fellowship one with another. And
[1:21:25] the blood of Jesus Christ, his son,
[1:21:27] cleanses us from all sin. So where do we
[1:21:30] find this fellowship? Walking in the
[1:21:31] light as he is in the light. We find it,
[1:21:34] amen, in the fellowship of the present
[1:21:36] tense word for our day, the light of the
[1:21:38] hour.
[1:21:40] Amen. And that's where we find this
[1:21:41] fellowship one with another. In God's
[1:21:44] provided way of approach to fellowship,
[1:21:45] he says, "But God in the
[1:21:47] beginning, it was that most glorious
[1:21:50] time when our gracious, precious God
[1:21:52] came down in the garden of Eden in the
[1:21:54] cool and would talk to Adam and Eve and
[1:21:56] they would
[1:21:57] fellowship. God, God created man because
[1:22:00] he wanted fellowship himself."
[1:22:03] And in the Garden of Eden, he would come
[1:22:05] and fellowship with his children. So God
[1:22:09] likes fellowship. Amen. God wants our
[1:22:12] fellowship.
[1:22:15] And God hiding himself in simplicity
[1:22:16] said God made a program when man sinned
[1:22:19] in the beginning back. He tried to find
[1:22:21] a way of escape for himself. He tried to
[1:22:23] make himself a covering, fig leaves and
[1:22:25] so forth. It never worked. But God did
[1:22:27] make a way that a man would fellowship
[1:22:29] with him again. And that was under the
[1:22:32] shed blood of an innocent substitute.
[1:22:34] So why did God why did God take the lamb
[1:22:38] and slay it? That way he could cover he
[1:22:40] could make an atonement or a covering
[1:22:42] for the sin because God wanted to get
[1:22:44] back in fellowship with his children.
[1:22:46] Fellowship was disrupted in the garden
[1:22:48] and God made man because he wanted
[1:22:50] fellowship. When he made Adam he was
[1:22:52] alone. God said brother says Adam was
[1:22:54] alone because God was alone in heaven.
[1:22:56] He had no fellowship. So he made man in
[1:22:59] his own image so that he could
[1:23:00] fellowship with him. And in the garden
[1:23:01] he would come down every day to have
[1:23:03] fellowship. But the fellowship was
[1:23:04] broken by sin and God had to find a way
[1:23:07] to bring it back and he started the
[1:23:08] process under the shed blood. So
[1:23:10] fellowship comes under the shed blood of
[1:23:12] an innocent one. Amen. Because it's
[1:23:15] God's desire to restore fellowship. You
[1:23:18] think we love fellowship? Where do you
[1:23:20] think that desire came from? It came
[1:23:22] from God. If we love fellowship, he's
[1:23:24] the original lover of fellowship. He's
[1:23:27] where fellowship started. And he made
[1:23:29] man for fellowship. And he made
[1:23:30] everything for fellowship. And he wants
[1:23:32] our fellowship. And he even started the
[1:23:34] plan of redemption to bring back
[1:23:36] fellowship. Amen.
[1:23:39] Amen. And Christ is the mystery
[1:23:41] revealed. He said secondly to have
[1:23:43] preeminence in his body of believers.
[1:23:45] That is his bride that he might live in
[1:23:47] people. That was part of God's purpose.
[1:23:50] Now he could do that in Adam and Eve,
[1:23:52] but sin separated them. So now there had
[1:23:53] to be some way to get it back again. You
[1:23:56] realize it wasn't man trying to get back
[1:23:59] in fellowship with God. It was God
[1:24:01] wanting to get back in fellowship with
[1:24:03] man. We look at the whole gospel
[1:24:06] egoentrical.
[1:24:07] This is one problem I have with
[1:24:09] Christianity, modern Christianity, is we
[1:24:12] we look at the whole Bible and the whole
[1:24:14] gospel from an egocentric perspective.
[1:24:17] It's all about us. God loved me and God
[1:24:20] wanted to save me and God. But listen,
[1:24:22] what did God want? Amen. Let's let's get
[1:24:25] beyond our own little thinking and go to
[1:24:27] God's perspective. God made man for
[1:24:29] himself. God made man for fellowship.
[1:24:32] God redeemed man because he wanted to
[1:24:34] restore fellowship and he wanted to
[1:24:36] bring back his original purpose.
[1:24:39] And
[1:24:40] so you realize when it came time for God
[1:24:43] to have a friend, is it okay if I say
[1:24:46] that?
[1:24:48] Who is the first one in the Bible that
[1:24:50] was called the friend of God? It was
[1:24:51] Abraham.
[1:24:53] Abraham was called a friend of God. God
[1:24:55] called him his friend. Amen.
[1:24:59] Did Abraham find God or did God find
[1:25:01] Abraham? Amen. Did Abraham go searching
[1:25:05] for God and he go on this big long
[1:25:06] search and I want God? He never went
[1:25:09] looking for God. Brother Bam said he was
[1:25:10] an idol worshipper packing idols on his
[1:25:13] back. His dad was an engraver of idols.
[1:25:15] Amen. But God came to him because God
[1:25:18] wanted somebody to fellowship with. God
[1:25:21] wanted a friend. Yes, sir. And then when
[1:25:23] God comes to his disciples, he says, I
[1:25:25] call you friends. And when he come to
[1:25:27] the garden of Gethsemane, Amen. He was
[1:25:30] so weighed by this decision he had to
[1:25:32] make. Brother Brandham said in the
[1:25:33] garden of Gethsemane, he had to decide
[1:25:36] would he take the sins of the whole
[1:25:37] world or would he stay with his
[1:25:39] disciples what he wanted to do. So what
[1:25:43] was so hard for for for Jesus? He wanted
[1:25:46] to stay with his disciples because they
[1:25:48] were his friends. He was in fellowship.
[1:25:50] He loved it. Yeah.
[1:25:54] But he had to give his life so that he
[1:25:56] could have perfect fellowship.
[1:25:59] So this is God's plan of redemption to
[1:26:03] bring back fellowship. Fellowship is so
[1:26:06] much more important than we ever
[1:26:08] thought.
[1:26:09] Fellowship with each other and
[1:26:12] fellowship with God. And I would say
[1:26:14] fellowship with the other each other is
[1:26:17] a part of fellowship with God. Amen.
[1:26:20] Amen. Amen. Who is this Melkisedc? He
[1:26:24] says God come down and became flesh and
[1:26:26] died to death in Christ so that he could
[1:26:29] clean the church in order to get into it
[1:26:32] for fellowship. Now we're getting into
[1:26:34] real redemption. Not not a lamb, not
[1:26:38] just shedding blood, not just a
[1:26:39] covering, but he was going to do
[1:26:40] something to erase the sin. Amen. And he
[1:26:43] could have limited fellowship, amen,
[1:26:46] along the way. But God has to make a way
[1:26:48] for unlimited fellowship.
[1:26:51] And so he came and became flesh and died
[1:26:54] to death in Christ so that he could
[1:26:57] clean the church. So what was the
[1:26:58] purpose of shedding of blood? For
[1:27:00] sanctification. So he could clean the
[1:27:02] church in order to get into it. For what
[1:27:05] purpose? For fellowship.
[1:27:10] Now then he says God loves fellowship.
[1:27:13] That's what he made the man at the first
[1:27:15] time for was for fellowship. God dwells
[1:27:18] alone with cherubams. So God's wanting
[1:27:21] this fellowship. So he came down himself
[1:27:23] in a body of flesh and gave his own
[1:27:25] life. Amen. So that he could sanctify a
[1:27:27] church. So that he could send back his
[1:27:29] spirit to live inside of you. For what
[1:27:32] reason? For fellowship. So now where do
[1:27:34] you fellowship with God at? Not in
[1:27:37] church, friends. Not you fellowship with
[1:27:40] God in your soul. Amen. where God has
[1:27:42] entered in, amen, by the power that was
[1:27:45] released at Calvary, by the shedding of
[1:27:47] blood, by the sanctification of the
[1:27:49] spirit so that he can enter in and dwell
[1:27:51] in you and be with you and be in you.
[1:27:54] Brother Brandham said, Amen. the this
[1:27:56] woman challenged brother Brandham
[1:27:58] because of the oneness doctrine and
[1:27:59] said, "Who was Jesus praying to when he
[1:28:01] prayed to the father in the garden of
[1:28:03] Gethsemane?" And he said, "Let me ask
[1:28:04] you a question." Yeah. Amen. Said, "Do
[1:28:06] you have the Holy Ghost?"
[1:28:08] Yes. He said, "Then who do you pray to
[1:28:11] when you pray?"
[1:28:13] How far away is this fellowship? Amen.
[1:28:15] It's as close as you let it be. Amen.
[1:28:18] God wants to fellowship with you. That's
[1:28:20] why he died. That's why he sanctified
[1:28:22] you. That's why he filled you with his
[1:28:24] spirit because he wants to fellowship
[1:28:26] with you. We go to egoentrical view
[1:28:30] again, right? God wanted me and he died
[1:28:32] for me and he filled me with the Holy
[1:28:33] Ghost so I was sealed so I can go to
[1:28:35] heaven. Listen, that's that's our little
[1:28:38] human pea brain perspective. But God did
[1:28:40] that because there was something he
[1:28:42] wanted.
[1:28:45] He wants your fellowship. He wants you
[1:28:47] to talk to him. He wants you to love
[1:28:49] him. Amen. He wants you to share your
[1:28:51] life with him and he wants to share his
[1:28:53] life with you. That's why in this
[1:28:55] generation under this message, amen, the
[1:28:58] veil has been taken away so that we
[1:29:00] could see what God has designed and
[1:29:02] wanted all along. So they're not stuck
[1:29:04] in a church denomination egoentrical
[1:29:06] view all surrounding us. But we can back
[1:29:09] up and go all the way back to the back
[1:29:10] part of God's mind and find out what he
[1:29:13] wanted all along. He wanted himself
[1:29:16] replicated as a family and flesh on the
[1:29:18] earth and fellowship with one another.
[1:29:20] Amen. God wanted to fellowship with
[1:29:22] himself.
[1:29:24] That's why he wants to live in you
[1:29:26] because he wants to fellowship with you
[1:29:28] in a deeper way than we could ever
[1:29:31] imagine. Amen.
[1:29:35] Oh my
[1:29:38] goodness. I want to read from a message.
[1:29:40] You must be born again.
[1:29:42] 1958. Something Brother Bram says just
[1:29:46] absolutely makes me come
[1:29:48] alive. And this is why I say God's been
[1:29:50] doing a deeper work in me and a deeper
[1:29:53] revelation. But it's so
[1:29:55] simple. He's talking about Adam and Eve.
[1:29:57] And he says, "They didn't go to a fine
[1:29:59] big church all decorated up in mahogany
[1:30:02] and a $100,000 organ in it. They went up
[1:30:05] in the woods, the timber, and perhaps
[1:30:07] that logos that went out of God, let's
[1:30:09] say it was in the form of a pillar of
[1:30:11] fire, a halo. I can just see it hanging
[1:30:13] in the bushes yonder and the streaks
[1:30:15] from it shining down when Adam and Eve
[1:30:17] knelt before the creator to worship. And
[1:30:19] I can hear a voice coming from that and
[1:30:21] say, "Has my children enjoyed their stay
[1:30:25] today upon the earth that the Lord thy
[1:30:27] God has given thee?" And here's the
[1:30:29] answer. Yes, father. It's been
[1:30:31] wonderful.
[1:30:34] Amen. Again, later in that year, 1958,
[1:30:38] in the message, why we're not a
[1:30:39] denomination says, "That halo is hanging
[1:30:41] yonder in the bushes. I can hear a voice
[1:30:43] speak down and say, "Has my children
[1:30:45] enjoyed themselves upon the earth the
[1:30:47] day that the Lord thy God has given
[1:30:49] thee?" Yes, Lord. We've enjoyed
[1:30:51] ourselves today, haven't we, darling?
[1:30:53] Yes. Yes, dear. We have, Lord, we sure
[1:30:56] appreciate you.
[1:31:01] This is the fellowship God loved.
[1:31:05] It's not complicated.
[1:31:09] It's not complex.
[1:31:11] It's not
[1:31:12] difficult. When God made man to
[1:31:15] fellowship with him, he put him on the
[1:31:18] earth and he come down in the cool of
[1:31:19] the evening and what did he
[1:31:22] say? Has my
[1:31:25] children enjoyed their day upon the
[1:31:27] earth today?
[1:31:30] It's so simple.
[1:31:33] It's so much more simple than we could
[1:31:36] ever imagine. Amen.
[1:31:41] God wants to know how you enjoyed your
[1:31:43] day.
[1:31:51] I I shared I think I shared this with
[1:31:54] you all some time ago. I shared it in uh
[1:31:56] Poland, but our family took a trip to
[1:31:59] Missouri several years ago, a couple
[1:32:01] years ago, and we went to a museum on
[1:32:03] the West and how the West was formed.
[1:32:06] and you go through from the beginnings
[1:32:07] and the time and you just follow it,
[1:32:10] trace it through and it was really a
[1:32:12] nice museum. I enjoyed it. But it got to
[1:32:14] the Native American Indian section and
[1:32:16] while I was there, there was a a
[1:32:18] document that had fil been filled out by
[1:32:20] a chief of one of the Indian tribes when
[1:32:23] the uh the the nation of America, the
[1:32:25] USA, was buying a large track of land
[1:32:28] over there. They were doing a sale. And
[1:32:31] this Indian, he wrote this down and he
[1:32:33] made some statements on it. It was a
[1:32:35] marvel to them how anybody thought they
[1:32:37] could buy and sell land that God
[1:32:39] created. I mean it was just interesting
[1:32:41] their his whole perspective. But then he
[1:32:43] made a statement and he says the white
[1:32:46] man goes to church once a week and
[1:32:49] worships his
[1:32:51] god. He said but the red man every time
[1:32:54] he enters a valley and he sees a valley
[1:32:57] and a mountain stream or a waterfall
[1:32:59] across his heart lifts up in praise to
[1:33:01] worship his creator.
[1:33:04] That's right. Which one would you call
[1:33:06] fellowship?
[1:33:09] With God,
[1:33:11] I think it's simpler than what we think.
[1:33:15] I don't think it's the way we fold our
[1:33:17] hands or the way we we chant certain
[1:33:21] things we always say when we pray. I
[1:33:23] think God just wants to dwell in you and
[1:33:27] be a part of your life.
[1:33:30] Amen.
[1:33:31] I think God wants to share your life
[1:33:33] with you.
[1:33:35] And it doesn't have to be super
[1:33:37] spiritual.
[1:33:40] Has my children enjoyed their day upon
[1:33:42] the earth today?
[1:33:45] Oh God, help us to come back to being
[1:33:47] children.
[1:33:49] And just say, God, thank you for today.
[1:33:55] God, thank you for loving me. Thank you
[1:33:58] for keeping me. Thank you for this
[1:34:00] message. Thank you for your word. Thank
[1:34:02] you for life. Thank you for my children.
[1:34:04] Thank God I am so blessed by your life.
[1:34:10] I think the fellowship God wants is not
[1:34:13] a recited prayer.
[1:34:16] And I it's it's not sometimes the work
[1:34:20] we do when we have to work in prayer and
[1:34:23] and say the right thing and say it the
[1:34:25] right way so that the prayer is answered
[1:34:28] and remember the right words to say in
[1:34:30] the right order and and then pray with
[1:34:32] power and authority. I think he just
[1:34:34] wants us to talk to him.
[1:34:36] I think it's pretty I think it's pretty
[1:34:39] simple. Friends,
[1:34:41] this message has taken the veil away.
[1:34:44] And it's also taken the barrier from the
[1:34:46] Holy Ghost cuz this Holy Ghost was bound
[1:34:48] for nearly 2,000 years by denominational
[1:34:51] waters. What were the denominational
[1:34:52] waters? It was the wrong understanding
[1:34:54] of God.
[1:34:56] You say it was the wrong teaching of
[1:34:58] doctrine and wrong all that was the
[1:35:00] wrong understanding of God. If you don't
[1:35:02] understand servy, you don't know what
[1:35:03] happened in the garden. You don't know
[1:35:04] the oneness of the Godhead. You don't
[1:35:06] know what you don't understand water
[1:35:08] baptism in Jesus name. It's all not
[1:35:09] really understanding God and his
[1:35:11] program. Amen. That's what it all comes
[1:35:13] down to. So what separated the full life
[1:35:17] of the Holy Ghost from dwelling in
[1:35:19] people? It was the barrier of
[1:35:20] denominational rivers. It was man's idea
[1:35:23] about God's word became a barrier to the
[1:35:26] full life of Christ.
[1:35:29] But that Holy Ghost has been loosed in
[1:35:31] the evening time by the evening time
[1:35:32] message. The Holy Ghost back in the
[1:35:35] people again. Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:35:37] Do you believe it's fullness? Yeah. Then
[1:35:39] God by Calvary, by redemption, by the
[1:35:43] opening of the seals has brought back
[1:35:46] fellowship
[1:35:49] so that the full measure of his life can
[1:35:51] live fully in his people
[1:35:55] so that he can ask you at the end of the
[1:35:56] day, how has your day been today? Amen.
[1:36:06] Can we accept that? Can we let it be
[1:36:08] that easy? And can we be thrilled that
[1:36:11] he wants to know how what I thought
[1:36:14] about my day today that God wants me to
[1:36:16] speak back to him the things I saw and
[1:36:19] the things I learned and the things I
[1:36:21] appreciated or the things that I still
[1:36:23] need to learn or the things I want to
[1:36:24] understand or the things I'd ask him to
[1:36:26] share with me or help me with. Amen. I
[1:36:29] think it's that simple that he just
[1:36:31] wants to be a part of our everyday life,
[1:36:34] every moment, every day, all the time.
[1:36:39] That's fellowship.
[1:36:41] It's a blending together. It's a mixing.
[1:36:44] It's it's a partnership. It's a
[1:36:46] community. It's a communion.
[1:36:49] Him and me and me in him. And he wants
[1:36:53] to share in my life. And he wants me to
[1:36:55] share my life with him. and he wants to
[1:36:58] share his life with me.
[1:37:02] This is why we love fellowship, friends.
[1:37:05] And this is true fellowship.
[1:37:08] Amen. Let's all stand together. That's
[1:37:10] enough for tonight. How many love
[1:37:12] fellowship? Amen. Amen. And how many
[1:37:16] when you lay down tonight just going to
[1:37:18] tell God how much you enjoyed Amen. the
[1:37:20] day? And can we just go tonight or even
[1:37:23] right now at the end of the day as we
[1:37:25] bow our heads at the end of the service.
[1:37:27] Musicians if you'll come and brother
[1:37:28] Blake if you'll come just just bow your
[1:37:31] head and and just say Lord Jesus thank
[1:37:35] you for showing me how simple fellowship
[1:37:38] can be. You don't have to have a PhD to
[1:37:41] fellowship with God. You don't have to
[1:37:43] be a certain age. You don't have to have
[1:37:44] a certain understanding. You don't have
[1:37:45] to grow up and know so many things.
[1:37:48] Listen, the message is not about knowing
[1:37:50] doctrine. And the message is about
[1:37:51] knowing him. Amen. The message is God.
[1:37:55] The message is the unveiling of God.
[1:37:58] Amen. It is God stripping away every
[1:38:01] barrier that kept you from seeing him.
[1:38:06] Amen. So if the message to you becomes a
[1:38:08] barrier, you're not seeing the message.
[1:38:10] Right. Amen.
[1:38:12] You say, "Brother Chad, that's rough."
[1:38:14] It's the truth. Amen. If the message of
[1:38:17] the hour, the preaching of brother
[1:38:19] Brandham, the things that he brought, if
[1:38:21] that becomes a barrier to you, then you
[1:38:23] don't understand what he's saying. Amen.
[1:38:27] Because the message came to remove the
[1:38:29] veil.
[1:38:31] And it was the unveiling of God. God
[1:38:33] showing you who he really is, what his
[1:38:35] plan is, what his program is, and what
[1:38:37] he wants
[1:38:39] from you and in you and with you. It's
[1:38:42] really very simple. is can it get
[1:38:45] complex? Absolutely. It can go as deep
[1:38:48] as you want to go. It goes deeper than
[1:38:50] you ever imagined. Amen. Comp complex.
[1:38:53] You talk about complex. It's the entire
[1:38:56] Bible. It's the whole mind of God. I
[1:38:58] mean, it's not simplistic. You can't
[1:38:59] It's not like 30 second explanation. You
[1:39:01] got everything you need to know. Hey,
[1:39:03] listen. I want to know everything there
[1:39:04] is to know, and I'm going to spend
[1:39:06] eternity
[1:39:07] experiencing it.
[1:39:10] But the reality is simple. Yeah. Is God
[1:39:15] wants to be known and he wants to reveal
[1:39:18] himself to you and he wants to share his
[1:39:21] life with you and your life with him.
[1:39:23] Amen.
[1:39:25] Is that what you want? Amen. Then if you
[1:39:28] want the same thing God wants, why don't
[1:39:29] you just open your heart and give him
[1:39:31] what he wants and receive what he wants?
[1:39:33] Let's just bow our heads and pray. Lord
[1:39:35] Jesus, we are so thankful Lord that you
[1:39:38] want fellowship with us. And who are we,
[1:39:41] Lord, to fellowship with the Almighty
[1:39:43] God, the creator of heavens and earth.
[1:39:46] God, how can we think ourselves worthy?
[1:39:48] We're not
[1:39:49] worthy. But by your shedding of your own
[1:39:51] blood, you've made us worthy. Because
[1:39:54] you want in fellowship, Lord, it's not
[1:39:56] just what we seek. Although we love it,
[1:39:58] we're recognizing, Lord, this is what
[1:40:00] you
[1:40:01] want. This is what you lost in the
[1:40:03] Garden of Eden. It's what you purchased
[1:40:06] back at Calvary. And it's what you've
[1:40:08] opened up and restored in the end
[1:40:10] time. God, I just want to tell you, I've
[1:40:13] enjoyed my day upon your creation
[1:40:17] today. I've enjoyed the testimony of the
[1:40:21] three brothers and and being refreshed
[1:40:24] in their
[1:40:25] experience. I enjoyed hearing about my
[1:40:28] brothers and sisters in other parts of
[1:40:29] the world. I enjoyed the experience of
[1:40:31] sharing it myself. I enjoyed seeing the
[1:40:34] faces of your children. I enjoyed the
[1:40:37] pres your presence and I enjoyed the
[1:40:39] connection with your saints. I enjoyed
[1:40:42] being in church tonight.
[1:40:44] Thank you, Lord. Thank you for sharing
[1:40:47] your life and your word with me. I
[1:40:50] enjoyed the day you gave me upon the
[1:40:53] earth. It's never been without trial.
[1:40:55] It's never been without difficulty, but
[1:40:57] it's been blessed, Lord. And at the end
[1:40:59] of the day, we want to lift our hands
[1:41:01] and our voices and say, "Thank you,
[1:41:03] Lord. Thank you for giving us life.
[1:41:06] Thank you for giving us eyes to see and
[1:41:08] ears to hear. Thank you for your word.
[1:41:11] Thank you for my brothers and sisters.
[1:41:13] Thank you for your life that lives in
[1:41:15] them. Thank you for the fellowship that
[1:41:18] we get to share. Just want to say, I
[1:41:20] love you, Lord. Thank you for being with
[1:41:23] me until the end of the
[1:41:25] age. Thank you for sharing your life
[1:41:28] with me. And God, I want to share my
[1:41:31] life with you. I give you myself to you
[1:41:35] aresh. I praise your name and thank you
[1:41:38] Jesus. Be blessed in our praises. Be
[1:41:41] blessed and our worship as we glorify
[1:41:45] your name. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:41:48] pray.
[1:41:50] Amen.
[1:41:52] Amen. Don't ever put him far
[1:41:55] away. Brother Brandham said, "What are
[1:41:58] you going to do? Call him down from
[1:42:00] heaven?"
[1:42:01] He said, "No, he's in you right now.
[1:42:07] How are you going to fellowship with
[1:42:08] him? Where you going to go? You going to
[1:42:09] wait till you come to church on
[1:42:11] Wednesday?" Listen, don't wait for
[1:42:13] Wednesday and don't wait for
[1:42:16] Sunday. Every time you see a sunrise,
[1:42:19] every time you feel his presence, every
[1:42:22] time you hear his word, every time you
[1:42:24] read your Bible, every time you hear a
[1:42:26] song, just say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:42:28] I love you."
[1:42:29] That's really the fellowship he wants.
[1:42:32] Not saving it and bottling it all up for
[1:42:35] some big huge expressive prayer or
[1:42:37] coming to church and we have just simple
[1:42:42] every day when you get a good parking
[1:42:44] spot. Praise God. Thank you, Lord. I
[1:42:48] appreciate this. But I mean, it sounds
[1:42:51] silly, but he wants to share your life.
[1:42:53] Amen. He wanted to know if his children
[1:42:55] in the Garden of Eden enjoy the sunrise
[1:42:57] and the dew of the grouse and the mist
[1:42:59] coming up from the ground. Yeah. If you
[1:43:01] talk about what they were experiencing,
[1:43:02] brother Bam goes back and he dramatizes.
[1:43:05] He Adam was taking his his wife through
[1:43:07] the garden and he was rubbing sheet of
[1:43:09] the lion's back and they were looking at
[1:43:11] this and looking at that and then they
[1:43:12] went up to worship God and God said,
[1:43:14] "Did you enjoy your day upon the earth?"
[1:43:16] What were they doing? They were
[1:43:17] scratching the lion's back and looking
[1:43:19] at the flowers and God wanted to be part
[1:43:21] of it.
[1:43:23] Amen.
[1:43:25] Don't put him far away and don't make
[1:43:27] fellowship complicated and don't try to
[1:43:29] figure out the right words to say. He
[1:43:32] doesn't need Sometimes you can
[1:43:33] fellowship without words.
[1:43:38] Have you ever felt his presence in your
[1:43:39] and something inside of you jumped right
[1:43:41] here to your throat and you had nothing
[1:43:42] to say?
[1:43:46] You ever felt him draw so near like a
[1:43:48] breeze that blows past you and all of a
[1:43:50] sudden mist comes to your eyes and all
[1:43:53] you can say is, "I love you, Lord." That
[1:43:55] ever happened to you? I hope it does. If
[1:43:57] it hasn't, I hope it
[1:44:00] does. He wants your
[1:44:03] fellowship. Keep him on your mind every
[1:44:06] hour of the day.
[1:44:09] Don't wait. We pray in the morning. We
[1:44:11] do devotions. We
[1:44:12] pray. But I don't think he wants to
[1:44:15] wait.
[1:44:17] I think he just wants to share our
[1:44:18] lives. Man, God bless you all. It's so
[1:44:22] good to be home. I love you all.
[1:44:30] Amen. Will children of the light
[1:44:34] arise. Arise and take your place. It's
[1:44:38] by grace. It's by grace. It's by grace.
[1:44:42] Amen.
[1:44:43] If you're struggling in confusion,
[1:44:46] wondering why your heart seems low, take
[1:44:49] your hands off this old world and let it
[1:44:54] go. Let it go. Let it be. It's not

[1:46:20] So let it
[1:46:22] go. Let it go. Let it be. It's not
[1:46:28] reality, but a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:46:32] shadow.

[1:46:37] father living here below. For you're not
[1:46:41] of this old world. So let it

[1:47:05] go. Oh, let it go, let it be. It's not
