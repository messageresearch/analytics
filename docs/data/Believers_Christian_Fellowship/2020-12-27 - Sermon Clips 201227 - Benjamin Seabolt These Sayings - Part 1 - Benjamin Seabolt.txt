========================================

brother branham said the secret of the message was to be about the father's business and the father's business was to fulfill the word of god and then he gives us our instructions of what we must do to be about the father's business and he says our instructions are to vindicate malachi 4. to vindicate luke 17 30. to vindicate hebrews 13 8 saint john 14 12 all of his word revelation 10 7 the opening the seals and the mysteries of god i'm going to make it real plain for you saints we know there's an attack on this message we know there's an attack on the prophet there's an attack on the cloud there's a tackle on this vision there's a tackle on that vision there's attack on this situation we are not to try to re-fulfill those things we are to vindicate and to clear and remove all suspicion or false blame and to show and to prove that which has been said to be right reasonable and justified and here's the thing we're to do that without ever uttering a word because if you utter a word they can utter more words if you argue they can argue back if you get facts and figures and clippings and whatever else they can get more what they can't argue with is the vindication of a lived life because deep down in their heart they will know i can argue all that i want to but you know what they'll never say this they're incapable of saying this because if they say this they declare that you and the father are one and if they say that then they are to automatically declare what their father is but what they will never tell you is you know what that person's got something i don't have and it lines up with what that man said that they call as a prophet and when you vindicate that you remove all suspicion and blame from that ministry that god sent us
