[10:19] to having him here this Wednesday and
[10:21] also one other exciting announcement at
[10:23] the end of service today we'll have a
[10:25] baptism amen our sister Jade Lynn
[10:28] desires to be bap apz in the name of the
[10:30] Lord Jesus Christ and she's got quite a
[10:32] testimony and I'm I'm so thankful that
[10:34] God's brought her our way she's been
[10:36] fellowshipping with us now for several
[10:37] weeks and uh so we'll be happy to
[10:40] baptize her at the end of service amen
[10:43] God is good God is good God is hunting
[10:46] out his Sheep amen and he's bringing
[10:49] them to himself and so we're just so
[10:51] excited to be able to witness that amen
[10:54] I'm going to say welcome to all the
[10:55] visitors I see several faces God bless
[10:57] you it's always good to have you here
[10:59] with us and we want you to feel very
[11:01] welcome just relax pull on the word
[11:04] receive from God Amen let's look at
[11:07] Ephesians chap 4: 1
[11:11] together I therefore the prisoner of the
[11:14] Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of
[11:16] the vocation wherewith you were called
[11:19] with all loneliness and meekness with
[11:21] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[11:24] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[11:27] the spirit in the bond of Peace amen so
[11:30] we see the attitude by which Paul is
[11:33] instructing us how we should walk in the
[11:35] calling wherewith we were called and
[11:38] we've been called to be part of the body
[11:39] of Jesus Christ and in this last day
[11:42] it's a tremendous calling to be the
[11:44] manifested bride but he wants us to walk
[11:47] with all lonliness that's all humility
[11:49] and meekness and longsuffering that's
[11:52] patience forbearing are caring caring
[11:55] one another are yeah supporting one
[11:58] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[12:02] unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace
[12:04] this is how that we should be working
[12:06] amen this should be our attitude our
[12:08] approach it should be our effort and
[12:10] then we we we've been going into chapter
[12:12] 4 as we know that uh Christ ascended on
[12:16] high and gave gifts unto men and we went
[12:17] into the fivefold ministry as the five
[12:20] office gifts and we went into what was
[12:22] the purpose of those gifts and it was
[12:24] you know for the uh uh to BU build to
[12:27] equip the Saints to build up the body
[12:29] till we all come in the unity of the
[12:30] faith to the stature of a perfect man
[12:32] that's why this was given and then we go
[12:35] all the way down to verse 16 which I
[12:36] want to read together which to me
[12:38] becomes the culmination of the whole
[12:40] thing in verse 16 from whom that's from
[12:43] Christ the head from whom the whole body
[12:46] fitly joined together and compacted by
[12:48] that which every joint supplieth
[12:50] according to the effectual working in
[12:52] the measure of every part making
[12:55] increase of the body unto the edifying
[12:57] of itself in in love amen God bless you
[13:01] as you have your seats
[13:03] amen I've been enjoying this uh
[13:06] Ephesians chapter 4 so much because I'm
[13:09] beginning to realize more and more what
[13:11] the gifts are for what the fful ministry
[13:14] was for what the purpose God gave it it
[13:16] all comes down to his
[13:19] body and that's the great manifestation
[13:22] in the end time is the fulfilling of the
[13:24] promise of his body Amen in Bride form
[13:27] amen and she's supposed be standing here
[13:29] in the Splendor of him in the end time
[13:32] amen so it's going to be a complete
[13:34] building up of this body and a display
[13:36] of that body in full measure in the end
[13:38] time and that's where we're at amen it's
[13:41] going to take a fivefold Ministry to
[13:42] bring us there and it's also going to
[13:44] take every gift in the body and every
[13:46] joint supplying and every member working
[13:49] together for one purpose amen it's not
[13:52] just a fful Ministry and it's not just a
[13:54] few gifts it's everything working
[13:56] together for one goal that God had one
[13:58] one thing he wanted to achieve one
[14:00] purpose that he had in the back of his
[14:02] mind that's been unfolding through three
[14:03] folds the first he accomplished in Jesus
[14:06] Christ amen the second he's doing now
[14:09] getting preeminence in a people amen
[14:11] which will be the bride amen which is
[14:12] also his body amen and it's going to
[14:17] take every member every person every
[14:21] attribute everyone working together for
[14:24] the same purpose for the same goal which
[14:26] is for the body so that this body for
[14:30] working
[14:32] together in the measure of every
[14:36] part that doesn't exclude
[14:39] any every part making increase of the
[14:43] body what body the body of Jesus Christ
[14:46] on Earth making increase of the body
[14:50] unto the edifying building up of itself
[14:53] in love so now we find that we're all
[14:56] responsible for the same thing
[14:59] every one of us has a shared
[15:01] responsibility to do the same thing that
[15:03] we are all as members of this body as a
[15:06] joint that supplies we are all here for
[15:08] the same thing to build up the body of
[15:11] Christ to the edifying of itself in
[15:14] love praise God so we all have the same
[15:17] responsibility regardless of our gift
[15:19] regardless of our position whether we
[15:21] hold an office or don't hold an office
[15:23] we have a diversity of gifts we have a
[15:25] diverse distribution of gifts we have a
[15:27] diverse Ministry of those gifts we have
[15:29] a diverse working of those gifts we
[15:32] understand all of that and it's all
[15:33] different and and it and it's there's no
[15:35] cookie cutter right there's quite a
[15:37] diversity but it's all there for one
[15:40] purpose and that's this purpose to build
[15:42] itself together in love for the building
[15:43] of of the body so we all have a shared
[15:45] responsibility regardless if we're man
[15:47] or woman regardless if we're aged
[15:50] regardless if we're new in the into the
[15:52] message where're where we have
[15:53] experience or little experience whether
[15:54] we're a young person a teenager a young
[15:56] adult a young family or a senior citizen
[15:59] we all have the same goal the same
[16:01] purpose and are being used for the same
[16:04] thing so it doesn't matter our status
[16:07] our position it does none of that
[16:09] matters we all have the same
[16:11] responsibility praise God brother B says
[16:14] in the message choosing of a bride says
[16:17] the other is pregnated by the word of
[16:19] God and will bring forth the body the
[16:22] finished body of Jesus Christ which is
[16:25] the bride so one is pregnated and will
[16:28] bring forth an antichrist amen that's
[16:30] the false church but the true church is
[16:32] pregnated on the by the word of God and
[16:34] will bring forth the body the finished
[16:37] body of Jesus Christ which is the bride
[16:42] so what's the finished body of Jesus
[16:44] Christ the bride the body of Christ
[16:46] isn't finished yet how many knows that a
[16:48] man and a woman is one and Christ is one
[16:51] body the word the bride will have to be
[16:53] the rest of that body and the two
[16:56] together makes the one body again like
[16:58] like Adam was at the beginning man his
[17:00] wife are one and this is the age that we
[17:03] lived in for this unification The Head
[17:05] and the body coming together amen and
[17:07] the body coming into full
[17:10] display brother bam said several of
[17:13] these things we're going into right here
[17:14] at the beginning our review from the
[17:15] last two services and then we'll go
[17:17] forward but in this uh uh quote from the
[17:20] voice of the sign says when God has
[17:22] called a person for a job to do there is
[17:25] no one can take its place there is no
[17:27] one can take your place your
[17:30] peculiarity I I love that because we
[17:33] have peculiarities amen I mean it it
[17:36] doesn't take long for us to recognize
[17:38] that we are peculiar from one another we
[17:40] have uniqueness and we have differences
[17:42] and those differences we can allow to
[17:44] become a problem if we allow them to
[17:46] become a problem or we can see them as a
[17:48] benefit if we allow them to become a
[17:50] benefit it kind of depends on our
[17:52] attitude towards the peculiarities
[17:55] amen and brother bam goes on to say I
[17:58] can can never take or Robert's place he
[17:59] can never take mine nobody can take your
[18:01] place and he and he and then he says
[18:03] you're each one set in God's economy
[18:07] just for its
[18:08] place one fast all the time and communes
[18:11] with God while another one cast out
[18:13] Devils because this one is fasting but
[18:15] it's the whole body of Christ working
[18:17] together the unity amen sometimes what I
[18:21] find and many of us what we struggle
[18:24] with is is not that we don't believe in
[18:27] our brothers or sisters but most of the
[18:28] time we're not believing in
[18:30] ourselves most of us are struggling with
[18:33] self-doubt and we we have self-
[18:35] questions and and many times because we
[18:38] can't easily label
[18:40] ourselves I have this gift and I have
[18:43] this office you know when when uh when I
[18:48] I we talked before about the uh nine
[18:50] spiritual gifts that are in the church
[18:51] out of First Corinthians 12 we talk
[18:53] about the gift of tongues it's easy to
[18:56] be identified as having the gift of
[18:57] tongues because it's
[18:59] self-evident you speak in tongues you
[19:01] have the gift of tongues also for
[19:02] interpretation of tongues it becomes
[19:04] self-evident but many of the other gifts
[19:06] aren't self-evident amen how do you know
[19:08] you have the gift of
[19:12] wisdom I mean the person who says I have
[19:14] the gifts of wisdom listen to me he
[19:15] probably is not the
[19:17] one that we we're actually going to
[19:20] listen to
[19:21] amen some things are not so self-evident
[19:24] amen it begins to declare itself amen
[19:27] but it's not like amen the church votes
[19:29] you in as
[19:32] wisdom so so so many times we have
[19:35] questions about where we fit into the
[19:37] body and what our gift is and where our
[19:39] position is amen and and then that
[19:41] begins the devil can use that to bring
[19:43] self-doubt why I don't have a position I
[19:45] don't have an office I don't have a gift
[19:47] because I can't show up to church with
[19:48] my label on my shirt that I am I have
[19:51] wisdom or I have knowledge or I have
[19:52] discernment of spirits or I'm placed in
[19:54] the body for helps or I'm here for
[19:56] governments right
[19:58] and so we're always wondering what are
[20:00] we and what are we doing but but the
[20:02] scripture is so clear that you've been
[20:04] placed in the body by God Amen that God
[20:07] has positioned you and God has also
[20:09] equipped you and the prophet comes along
[20:11] to confirm the scriptures so well to say
[20:13] that God has been looking after you
[20:16] generationally to get a certain Ting out
[20:18] of your life and then God by a spirit
[20:20] has placed in you something that he
[20:22] wants to use to minister to the rest so
[20:25] now it's not about I I think we need to
[20:27] get away from trying to figure out what
[20:28] I am what's my gift what's my role amen
[20:31] and just seek God and say God use me any
[20:34] way you want to use me and I just want
[20:36] to be engaged I want to be plugged in I
[20:38] want to be part of the body so that you
[20:40] can use me for whatever and I may never
[20:43] I may never get to the end of my life
[20:45] and say I had XYZ gift or I was this in
[20:48] the body but you're still going to be it
[20:50] and you're still going to have it
[20:52] regardless if you can identify or not
[20:54] identify and usually it's the people
[20:56] around you that can identify it
[20:59] amen but the point is we're not seeking
[21:02] labels we're not seeking
[21:04] positions we just want to be a joint
[21:07] that suppli
[21:08] us we just want to be a a a member where
[21:12] every member amen is building up is is
[21:16] strengthening is giving something amen
[21:19] and God didn't Place us God didn't place
[21:21] you in the body to be a
[21:24] parasite just to suck life and give
[21:27] nothing no go God placed you in there to
[21:29] be a joint amen that Supply amen where
[21:32] there's a symbiotic relationship where
[21:34] there's a coexistence where I'm giving
[21:36] and receiving amen I'm supplying and I'm
[21:40] being supplied too amen by being in the
[21:42] body and that's what God wants
[21:46] amen so God has placed Us in there with
[21:48] our
[21:49] peculiarities amen and we I think what
[21:51] we need to do more than anything is
[21:53] learn to relax and learn to trust God
[21:56] right because at some point our
[21:59] self-doubt becomes doubting God that's
[22:02] right right and we think it's okay just
[22:05] to doubt ourselves and we think it's
[22:07] okay amen somehow that it's humble just
[22:09] to keep doubting ourselves amen and keep
[22:12] questioning ourselves amen but at some
[22:14] point you're doubting the very wisdom of
[22:16] God to place you in a body in an
[22:19] assembly you're you're doubting the very
[22:21] work of God to make you the way you are
[22:24] amen and and to place you where he's
[22:26] placed you and to equip you the way he's
[22:28] equipped you amen and we begin it and
[22:31] sometimes I think we're doubting God
[22:33] Amen not just doubting
[22:37] ourselves and I wonder how many times we
[22:39] stay in this self-doubt and we hinder
[22:41] ourselves from just engaging in
[22:43] supplying and giving because we're so
[22:46] concerned about what am I what what
[22:48] should I do and we we reserve Reserve
[22:51] Reserve Reserve until we're actually not
[22:53] doing anything for anybody because we
[22:55] won't just trust God put me here for a
[22:58] purpose and I'm part of it and I'm going
[22:59] to be part of it I'm going to be fully
[23:02] committed and fully part of it and God
[23:04] can do whatever he wants yeah
[23:08] amen so when it comes also to gifts
[23:11] brother Brenham said God can drop a gift
[23:13] on one person one time in their life and
[23:14] it never operates again a gift of
[23:16] Prophecy they can have a a word of
[23:18] knowledge they can have uh tongues or
[23:20] interpretations and never again so it's
[23:22] not all it's not like you've been
[23:23] endowed with that gift forever amen so
[23:25] being plugged in and being a channel God
[23:28] can drop something on you one time amen
[23:30] and do something for the body amen and
[23:32] it's a great help it doesn't mean he
[23:34] ever will do it again or it could be a
[23:36] way in which he'll operate with you many
[23:38] times amen let's not worry about it
[23:41] let's just stay engaged amen so that God
[23:44] can use us once he can use us many times
[23:46] he can use us in a different way at
[23:48] different time
[23:50] yeah and not worry about it but just say
[23:53] I'm here to build the body of Christ I'm
[23:57] here here to supply for the body and I
[24:02] and to do that I can't do that separated
[24:04] from the
[24:06] body
[24:07] right let's go to Romans chapter 12
[24:17] together it's amazing how sometimes we
[24:20] get into some of the simplest
[24:22] subjects like members of the body and
[24:25] yet it's so profound
[24:28] and sometimes the simplest things the
[24:30] things that's slowing us down or
[24:32] hindering us are holding us up yes you
[24:35] remember you
[24:38] know no matter how advanced you get in
[24:41] algebra you're always going to need your
[24:43] ABCs so all of a sudden the ABCs become
[24:46] profound yeah when because when the ABCs
[24:49] get applied to a higher form of language
[24:52] or to a higher form of math it's the
[24:54] same basic structure of the alphabet
[24:57] it's the same word Blends when you're
[24:58] talking about Advanced language amen but
[25:01] all of the sudden this simplistic uh uh
[25:04] alphabet keeps going deeper and deeper
[25:06] and deeper amen but you can't go deeper
[25:09] without keeping the simple
[25:11] alphabet so all of a sudden the simple
[25:13] things are absolutely profound amen and
[25:16] the profound things can be absolutely so
[25:20] simple so it all works
[25:22] together Romans 12
[25:25] and3 says for I say through the grace
[25:28] given unto me to every man that is among
[25:30] you not to think of himself more highly
[25:32] than he ought to think this is such good
[25:36] advice but to think soberly according as
[25:38] God has dealt to every man The Measure
[25:40] of Faith you're only here because God
[25:43] gave you a Measure of Faith to believe
[25:47] you only believe the message because
[25:48] something was in you to believe with
[25:51] something predestinated before the
[25:52] foundation world not because you're a
[25:54] genius not because you're great or
[25:55] you're super spiritual amen you believe
[25:57] because he dealt to every man The
[25:59] Measure of Faith so let's not get puffed
[26:01] up in vain in our imaginations as if
[26:04] we're something special amen we're not
[26:06] special God is
[26:08] special amen and what he's done is
[26:11] special so let's not think more highly
[26:15] of ourselves than we ought to think but
[26:17] to think soberly according as God to
[26:19] dealt every man The Measure of Faith for
[26:21] as we have many members in one body and
[26:23] all members have not the same office so
[26:26] we being many are one body in Christ and
[26:28] everyone members one of
[26:30] another having then gifts differing
[26:32] according to the grace that is given to
[26:34] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[26:37] according to the proportion of Faith
[26:39] what is he saying
[26:42] here let us do it according to the grace
[26:45] that is given to us this means you're
[26:49] not inventing anything you're not making
[26:52] up anything you're not trying to have
[26:54] you're just operating in the grace that
[26:57] he's already given given
[26:58] you if you prophesy the prophecy
[27:01] according to the proportion of Faith
[27:04] what faith the faith he's already given
[27:06] you this isn't a striving for something
[27:10] this is letting what he's put in you
[27:12] come out in the measure he's put it in
[27:15] you or Ministry now remember Ministry is
[27:18] not just Pulpit Ministry amen prophesy
[27:22] in the New Testament many times just
[27:23] means to preach many times you see
[27:25] Prophet or prophesy means to preach
[27:27] Ministry means to serve or minister
[27:31] to so if Ministry let us wait on our
[27:35] ministering or he that teacheth on
[27:37] teaching or he that exhorteth on
[27:40] exhortation he that giveth let him do it
[27:42] with Simplicity he that ruleth with
[27:44] diligence he that showeth Mercy with
[27:47] cheerfulness let love be without
[27:51] dissimilation abore that which is evil
[27:53] cleave to that which is good be kindly
[27:57] affectionate one to another with
[27:58] Brotherly Love in honor preferring one
[28:02] another it always comes back to
[28:05] love when we talk about the body and the
[28:08] building of the body and the operation
[28:10] of gifts and the offices and ministering
[28:12] to the body it all comes back to
[28:17] love praise
[28:19] God so we find
[28:22] then that we operate according to the
[28:25] grace that's given us according to the
[28:28] prop proportion of faith that we have
[28:31] it's not something that we're trying to
[28:34] achieve to is something that God has
[28:37] placed in us that he can work through
[28:41] us let's go to First Peter chapter
[28:48] 4 1 Peter chapter
[28:54] 4 1 Peter chapter 4 verse
[29:01] 7 but the end of all things is at hand
[29:05] be therefore sober and watch un prayer
[29:08] and above all things have fervent
[29:10] charity among yourselves for charity
[29:12] shall cover the multitude of sins this
[29:15] comes back to love
[29:17] again have love uh have fervent that
[29:22] means Earnest an Earnest desire have
[29:25] fervent love among yourselves for love
[29:27] shall cover the multitude of sins use
[29:31] Hospitality to one another without
[29:34] grudging that means don't just do kind
[29:36] things but secretly you're really angry
[29:38] about it I always have to do that and I
[29:41] that's wrong amen if you feel that way
[29:43] just don't do it amen I'd rather you not
[29:46] do something nice for me if you turn
[29:48] around and say I always have to do that
[29:49] and just please don't do it amen let's
[29:53] be genuine in the way we minister to one
[29:55] another and let's just do what what
[29:57] genuinely comes from the heart not out
[29:58] of obligation but out of a genuine
[30:00] desire to
[30:02] serve
[30:04] amen verse 10 as every man hath received
[30:07] the gift even so Minister the same one
[30:10] to another what you have received not
[30:12] what you got not what you tried to have
[30:14] but what you've received Minister that
[30:16] to one another you're ministering what
[30:18] you have not trying to have something to
[30:21] minister you're ministering from what
[30:23] you have amen
[30:26] amen
[30:29] amen this verse 10 again as every manath
[30:31] received the gift even so Minister the
[30:33] same one to another as good sto stewards
[30:36] of the manifold grace of God if any man
[30:39] speak let him speak as the Oracles of
[30:40] God if any man Minister this is serve
[30:43] let him do it as of the ability which
[30:45] God giveth that God in all things may be
[30:47] glorified through Jesus Christ to whom
[30:49] be praise and Dominion forever and ever
[30:53] amen so how should we serve how should
[30:55] we Minister let him do it as of the
[30:57] ability which God giveth amen amen so we
[31:02] should relax yeah if God wants to use me
[31:05] he'll give me the grace he'll give me
[31:07] the faith he'll give me the ability
[31:09] he'll give me what I have need of to
[31:11] give to others and all I'm doing is
[31:13] giving what I have amen I'm giving
[31:16] whether it's finances whether it's time
[31:18] amen whatever God's put in me the
[31:20] measure of Grace the gift that he's
[31:22] given to me is what I minister to others
[31:24] I'm not trying to say well this is what
[31:26] the body needs I'll go become this and
[31:29] when I become this I'll give that to the
[31:31] B that's not how this works God puts in
[31:33] you a gift he puts in you The Measure of
[31:35] Faith he puts in you Grace amen he puts
[31:37] in you the manifold Gifts of of of Grace
[31:40] and now he asked you to minister the to
[31:42] the body according to the ability that
[31:45] is in
[31:48] you I I this is beautiful we should
[31:52] relax whatever God wants me to do he'll
[31:54] put in me to do and then it'll be a
[31:57] natural outflow from what he put in me
[32:00] amen so that we're never putting on
[32:02] we're never being obligated We're Never
[32:05] Getting constrained into something that
[32:07] doesn't fit and we're not comfortable
[32:09] with and it doesn't work right for us
[32:12] but yet God's equipping and God's giving
[32:14] Grace and God's giving faith and God's
[32:16] giving ability and God's giving gifts
[32:20] and out of those things we give to
[32:23] others if you think about even just the
[32:27] fful Ministry and the diversity of
[32:30] Brethren that God has called to preach
[32:31] the gospel and how different they are
[32:34] and and all of us all of us preachers
[32:36] are the same way we always look at
[32:38] somebody preach and say oh I wish I
[32:39] could preach like that that is so
[32:42] effective it is so good they look at
[32:45] look at how they're able to take this
[32:47] and this and go right to somebody's
[32:48] heart and look everybody's weeping and
[32:50] he touch their hearts and I'm like I
[32:53] wish I could do that somebody else is
[32:56] looking at somebody saying how can they
[32:58] get that out of that scripture and tie
[33:00] it back to how did they do that I wish I
[33:02] could do
[33:04] that is that right I hope I'm not the
[33:07] only one who can do that I watch
[33:08] somebody Minister said that's so good
[33:10] but we can only Minister according to
[33:12] the ability that he's given us under the
[33:15] grace that he's given the gift he's put
[33:17] in us that's the only way that we can
[33:18] Minister we can never try to copy it
[33:21] won't work we can never try to conform
[33:23] and say that's effective I'll do that it
[33:25] won't work friends you can come to a
[33:28] dynamic service a powerful service and
[33:29] it was so effective and the people were
[33:31] so moved and you say I'll just preach
[33:33] the way he preached because it worked it
[33:35] won't work for you because you can only
[33:37] Minister out of the ability that God's
[33:39] put in you out of the grace you have and
[33:42] The Measure of Faith that's already in
[33:43] you so we need to relax and just be
[33:46] exactly what we are and not try to be
[33:48] anything
[33:51] else listen we don't need four of the
[33:54] exact same
[33:55] preachers right
[33:59] and if we do God will just disperse them
[34:00] around the world cuz you don't need them
[34:02] all in the same
[34:04] place we should just relax and be what
[34:06] God's called us to
[34:08] be
[34:10] amen
[34:12] so uh I want to come and read a quote
[34:15] out here of the message from
[34:17] adoption brother brandom he he starts
[34:19] talking down the lines we're talking and
[34:21] he's going to make a switch and I want
[34:22] to make the switch with him so halfway
[34:24] through you'll see where he turns in
[34:27] 1960 adoption part one he says how that
[34:30] God has set some in the church through
[34:32] the labor pains oh they get tremendous
[34:34] sometimes when a church is groaning
[34:35] under the persecution in the outside
[34:37] world Believing on the Lord Jesus that
[34:39] the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[34:41] real to us as it was to Pentecost how
[34:44] they groan and cry under labor pains but
[34:47] when they are born and positionally Born
[34:49] Into the kingdom of God then the Holy
[34:52] Ghost has set in the church some
[34:53] Apostles some prophets some teachers
[34:55] some pastors some evangelists then he's
[34:58] given to their speaking with tongues
[35:00] interpretation of tongues knowledge
[35:02] wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of
[35:04] Miracles see where the church is now now
[35:06] this is my purpose of doing this the
[35:09] church is always trying to take someone
[35:11] else's corner but don't do that you can
[35:13] never raise corn in ephraim's corner if
[35:16] you're Manasseh you've got to take your
[35:18] place in Christ positionally take it oh
[35:22] it gets deep and Rich when we get in
[35:24] here how that God puts one in the church
[35:26] to speak with tongues another now we
[35:28] have we have been taught many times we
[35:30] all have to speak with tongues that's
[35:32] wrong we all got to do it no we don't
[35:35] they all didn't do one thing yeah each
[35:37] one was see the land was divided and
[35:40] divvied up by
[35:42] inspiration and I could take the
[35:43] scriptures and show it to you exactly
[35:45] that he put them in the place where they
[35:47] were supposed to be positionally how
[35:49] that the two half tribes had to stay
[35:51] across the river how that their mothers
[35:53] cried that in their birth and how that
[35:55] each place was supposed to be and now
[35:58] after you're in that don't mean that
[36:00] you're out free from war you still have
[36:01] to fight for every inch of ground you
[36:03] stand on sea Canaan did not represent
[36:05] the great Heaven because it's war and
[36:07] troubles and killings and fightings and
[36:08] so forth but it did represent this that
[36:10] it must be a perfect walk so now he
[36:13] comes down to the placing of the
[36:15] children of Israel Amen in the promised
[36:18] land under Joshua's Ministry and as they
[36:20] were placed there they were placed in
[36:22] tribal order they were set there in
[36:24] positionally placed by their birth
[36:27] am because when they were birthed amen
[36:30] the the mothers would grown under the
[36:31] labor paines and they would call out the
[36:33] tribal name Ephraim or Manasseh and all
[36:36] of that and then as the lot lots were
[36:38] cast and the land was divided under
[36:40] Joshua they would all go to their
[36:41] inheritance and the position that they
[36:43] held in the promised land determined
[36:46] what their purpose was for the whole
[36:49] nation Zebulon by the Sea he was to fish
[36:52] amen he was a fisherman and he was
[36:54] Coastal and lived a Coastal Life and all
[36:57] of those things but Ephraim was in the
[36:59] Bread Basket amen and they they would
[37:01] produce uh the wheat they were the wheat
[37:03] Center amen so so we begin to find that
[37:06] brother B talks about this one would
[37:08] grow corn one would Plant Fish the one
[37:10] with corn would Supply the coastal tribe
[37:12] the coastal tribe would Supply the
[37:14] Inland tribe amen and they were all
[37:16] doing for one
[37:18] another and So based off their birth
[37:21] coming into the promised land amen would
[37:23] position them their position would
[37:25] determine what they did amen and they
[37:27] just did and they were supposed to stay
[37:30] in their Lane amen amen right just do
[37:36] this don't try to be everything else
[37:38] somebody else will take care of this you
[37:40] just do this amen and then everything
[37:43] else will be taken care
[37:45] of sometimes we try to be everything
[37:47] amen I want to do this this and I see
[37:49] that that's good I want to do that oh I
[37:51] like that that brother I'm going to do
[37:52] that and all we're going to do is just
[37:54] hinder the thing that God's actually
[37:55] built us to to do we just need to stay
[37:57] in our lane and do what God called us to
[38:00] do and if we do it and we do it from the
[38:02] abundance that he's given to us and we
[38:03] do it with joy we do it with freedom
[38:05] amen and all of a sudden everybody else
[38:07] will take care of everything else that's
[38:09] undone amen right if we just stay in our
[38:14] lane he said the church is constantly
[38:16] getting in someone else's corner he says
[38:19] it this way they're trying to take the
[38:20] ball out of the guy's hand is running
[38:22] with it instead of blocking for him
[38:24] somebody needs to be a ball Runner
[38:26] somebody needs to be a
[38:30] blocker
[38:33] amen
[38:34] so it's it's something that everybody
[38:39] every joint must Supply and everything
[38:41] work together and he and he talked about
[38:43] this moving into the promised land and
[38:45] he types it to the spiritual
[38:48] church so we've got to stay our
[38:50] positions for the benefit of the whole
[38:55] body amen
[38:57] the problem is
[38:59] sometimes you know they don't give a
[39:02] Heisman Trophy to the
[39:06] blocker that's sometimes the problem
[39:09] that's sometimes the problem we run
[39:11] into they don't give the Heisman Trophy
[39:15] to the to the pooling guard to the
[39:18] tackle yeah yeah that's right is that
[39:22] true maybe maybe he gets some accolades
[39:25] once in a while they get into a Hall of
[39:27] Fame but generally it's the ones scoring
[39:30] the points making the pass throwing the
[39:32] ball running the ball their name gets
[39:34] mention they is mentioned game after
[39:37] game after
[39:39] game right but sometimes you don't even
[39:42] know who's on the
[39:44] [Music]
[39:45] line they get substituted in and out and
[39:48] you never even knew there was a change
[39:49] made right that's where the problem is
[39:53] yeah that's why sometimes a tackle wants
[39:56] to run the the
[39:57] ball and he's not built for it right he
[40:01] wants to catch the pass he wants to kick
[40:03] the field goal it's not his position
[40:06] right and it messes everything up yeah
[40:09] sometimes it's what happen because we
[40:11] see things and pride enters into man and
[40:16] we want to be where the name is
[40:17] mentioned and where the Highlight Reel
[40:20] film shows
[40:22] and and we're all susceptible to the
[40:24] same thing every one of is weak this
[40:27] area cuz that Old Pride was injected in
[40:29] the fall of
[40:31] Man and sometimes we have a hard time
[40:34] working in the shadows for the body of
[40:37] Christ that's sometimes where the devil
[40:39] trips us up we end up taking a position
[40:42] that's not
[40:43] ours or getting upset for not having a
[40:46] position that God never intended us to
[40:49] have rest assured God gifts find their
[40:52] place nobody's going to stop it God's
[40:55] gifts find their place if we don't
[40:57] believe that then we've got a
[41:00] problem because God's gifts will find
[41:02] their
[41:03] place and so we just need to rest and
[41:06] just do what comes natural and let God
[41:09] position let God move let God be blessed
[41:11] and let the body be
[41:14] increased edified in self and love
[41:19] that's the real purpose for the day we
[41:21] live in the purpose that for the day we
[41:23] live in is not to have a position the
[41:26] purpose is for this body to come into
[41:31] manifestation and if all I could I want
[41:33] to do everything I can to Foster that
[41:36] and I don't want to do anything to
[41:38] hinder that I would say we come to a
[41:40] place where God forgive me if I've done
[41:43] anything to hinder the building of the
[41:46] body together in itself in Love by not
[41:49] doing my part or or or criticizing
[41:52] somebody for doing their part if I've
[41:54] done anything to hinder this last day
[41:56] move God forgive me because we're all
[41:59] responsible for this same
[42:02] goal brother Benham then comes and this
[42:05] is where he takes a little turn he talks
[42:06] about the position and positional
[42:08] placement then he comes here uh continue
[42:11] on in the same quote and there's where
[42:13] the church is failing today on that walk
[42:16] he said it must be a perfect walk in
[42:18] your position in your
[42:20] land do you know that even your own
[42:22] behavior can knock somebody else out of
[42:24] getting
[42:25] healed your misbehavior of unconfessed
[42:28] Sins Of You Believers can cause this
[42:30] church to bitterly
[42:32] fail and at the day of judgment you'll
[42:34] be responsible for every bit of it you
[42:36] say now wait a minute brother brandham
[42:39] well that's the truth think of it Joshua
[42:41] after he crossed over into the land God
[42:43] gave him the promise just think to fight
[42:46] an entire campaign without losing a man
[42:48] without even getting a scratch without
[42:50] having to have a nurse or first aid or
[42:51] Band-Aid God said the land's yours go
[42:54] fight think of fighting a companion
[42:56] there's no Red Cross around at all
[42:57] there's nobody going to get hurt and
[43:00] they slayed the amorites and the
[43:01] Hittites but there wasn't one hurt among
[43:03] any of them until sin came in the camp
[43:07] and when achen took the Babylonian
[43:08] garment and the gold wedge and hid it
[43:10] under his Camp the next day they lost 16
[43:12] men Joshua said stop stop wait a minute
[43:15] there's something wrong something's
[43:18] wrong here we're going to call a 7day
[43:20] fast God made us a promise there will be
[43:23] nothing hurt uh nothing hurt us our
[43:25] enemies will fall at our feet and
[43:27] there's something wrong here something
[43:28] went wrong somewhere cuz we got 16 dead
[43:31] men laying here there's Israelite
[43:33] brothers and they're dead why did they
[43:35] die innocent men because one man stepped
[43:39] out of the line you see the reason this
[43:41] needs to be
[43:43] taught the church lining up lining up
[43:45] with the word of God lining up with God
[43:47] and lining up with each other walking
[43:49] perfectly upright soberly before all men
[43:52] fearing God because one man stole a
[43:54] garment and done something that he
[43:56] should not done took the life of 16 men
[43:59] I think it was 16 maybe more I believe
[44:01] it was 16 men that was dead Joshua
[44:03] called and said there's something wrong
[44:05] God made the promise and something's
[44:07] wrong and when we bring the sick up
[44:09] before us and they fail to be healed we
[44:11] need to call a solemn fast call an
[44:14] assembly something's wrong somewhere God
[44:17] made the promise God's got to stick to
[44:19] that promise and he will do
[44:22] it so all of a sudden we realize that
[44:25] because I'm part of the body my personal
[44:28] Behavior has an effect on the body I can
[44:31] no longer once I become part of the body
[44:34] and been baptized by the baptism of the
[44:35] Holy Ghost into the body of Christ I can
[44:38] no longer separate myself out and think
[44:40] what I do in private doesn't affect the
[44:42] body that's not true amen because we are
[44:45] spiritually linked to one another and
[44:47] what we do affects one another and now
[44:50] if we have a responsibility to build the
[44:52] body of Christ in each member in every
[44:54] joint that supplies then we have a
[44:56] responsibility to keep it built to keep
[44:59] it clean to keep it pure we each one
[45:02] have a personal
[45:04] responsibility this is why our own
[45:06] spiritual condition is so important our
[45:08] own spiritual health becomes vital to
[45:11] the spiritual health of the
[45:14] body
[45:17] amen
[45:19] so what each one of us does becomes
[45:22] important because we each have a
[45:24] personal responsibility
[45:26] to work in the program of
[45:29] God but you know what the enemy knows
[45:31] what the program of God is yes so what's
[45:34] he constantly trying to do he's trying
[45:36] to stop the program of God right and if
[45:40] the program of God is to manifest a body
[45:43] Jesus Christ body on Earth which is the
[45:45] bride amen if that's the program of God
[45:48] in this age then what's the devil trying
[45:50] to do he's trying to stop that
[45:51] manifestation of that body yeah
[45:54] amen and so each one of us how now have
[45:58] to be guarded because what we do and how
[46:02] we live becomes important am not just
[46:06] for
[46:07] me but for everybody
[46:10] else one thing that's so critical about
[46:13] recognizing that we're part of a body
[46:15] integrated with one another is now it
[46:18] causes me to think differently I can no
[46:22] longer live
[46:23] selfish this is what happens when a sing
[46:25] single man takes a wife and then has
[46:27] children he can no longer think as an
[46:30] individual unit
[46:32] anymore because now everything he does
[46:34] will affect his wife and then everything
[46:36] he does will affect his wife and his
[46:38] children this man no longer has the
[46:40] right just to please himself anymore
[46:43] that's why the Bible says when a man has
[46:44] a wife he seeketh to please the wife the
[46:46] wife to please the husband amen because
[46:49] that's the way it works we've lost our
[46:51] right when we come into a marriage Union
[46:53] amen just to seek our own pleasure but
[46:55] we're Now We're Here amen living for two
[46:59] amen and then the children come along
[47:01] and now we're not living for ourselves
[47:03] we're living for our family amen now
[47:05] when a wife amen she becomes a mother
[47:08] now every decision she makes she's
[47:10] weighing the children in the balance of
[47:12] every decision it just comes natural
[47:14] amen everything she everything she
[47:16] thinks about fixing everything she
[47:18] thinks about buying every place she
[47:20] thinks about going amen dad will say hey
[47:22] let's go on a date we haven't been out
[47:24] in forever I want to go and
[47:25] automatically mom's going well this one
[47:27] has the sniffles and I don't know and I
[47:29] don't want to leave them with a sitter
[47:30] they might need me and this other one
[47:31] they were scared last time we went and I
[47:34] think we'll just not go it's not that
[47:35] mom doesn't want to go it's Mom is
[47:38] sacrificing herself for the benefit of
[47:40] the
[47:40] body Hallelujah that's a real
[47:44] mother somebody who's struggling to be a
[47:46] real mother will say yeah get somebody
[47:48] here to watch them I don't
[47:51] care but that comes right into the body
[47:53] of Christ amen we cannot live selfish
[47:57] lives for ourselves and only doing what
[47:59] pleases ourselves CU what we do will
[48:01] affect the body we're connected to we
[48:04] have a responsibility
[48:08] amen praise
[48:10] God and the greatest battle ever fought
[48:13] he says and I thought then if that great
[48:15] Heavenly Host we read this last week
[48:18] that great Heavenly Host has has to keep
[48:20] its place to make everything in order
[48:22] he's talking about the the the stars and
[48:24] the constellations and the Sun and the
[48:26] Moon what about the disorder of the
[48:28] Earthly host how when one gets out of
[48:31] order how it throws the whole thing out
[48:33] of cater the whole program of God is
[48:35] upset when one member gets out of order
[48:37] we should continually strive to keep the
[48:39] order of the
[48:40] spirit I would to God this morning that
[48:43] we would bring this to a real healing
[48:45] service that we could keep this part
[48:48] this group that we have gathered under
[48:49] the roof this morning in such a Harmony
[48:52] that the Holy Spirit would place every
[48:54] member of the body
[48:56] that that's here this morning in such
[48:58] Harmony till there would be such a
[49:00] spontaneous healing of soul and body if
[49:03] we'll just hold our position I love this
[49:07] quote amen this quote has come to mean
[49:09] something to me amen because it's become
[49:11] so simple but so
[49:13] complicated it's so simple that if we
[49:15] could just get in Harmony and unity and
[49:17] each one of us hold our position not
[49:19] take somebody else's position and not
[49:21] abandon our position but just be in our
[49:24] position and be in harmony with one
[49:26] another until there could bring such a
[49:28] spontaneous healing of soul and body so
[49:31] now one member getting out of harmony
[49:34] with the word amen can cause us not to
[49:36] have healing is that what he typed with
[49:39] aen right one member out of harmony with
[49:42] the word out of harmony with the B body
[49:45] can hinder amen the promise of the word
[49:48] from taking effect amen now he's showing
[49:50] the opposite if we could each get in
[49:52] position and come into harmony there'
[49:54] being a spontaneous is healing of soul
[49:57] and
[49:58] body this is so much more this is so
[50:00] much bigger than we think this is not
[50:02] about getting dressed up putting on a
[50:04] suit and going to church twice a week
[50:06] it's more than that friends this is the
[50:08] this is the manifestation of our day
[50:11] this is the word taking on flesh and we
[50:13] all have a part to play in it and if we
[50:16] all play our part and give our full self
[50:18] to it it'll benefit everybody and we'll
[50:21] see the promises of God take effect
[50:23] again and again and again and again
[50:26] because this is the
[50:28] word we're not sitting here waiting for
[50:31] the word to be fulfilled like often the
[50:33] future someday something's going to
[50:35] happen we're all just sitting here
[50:36] waiting for the change of the body Amen
[50:38] brother brah said we're waiting on God
[50:40] he said God's waiting on
[50:44] you he says those Saints amen those
[50:47] sleeping Saints they're waiting for this
[50:49] church to come to Perfection to come
[50:52] into the stature of a perfect man amen
[50:55] Maybe what's holding up the resurrection
[50:57] is me amen me being fully engaged
[51:01] Plugged In selling out completely to the
[51:03] word of God and staying involved and
[51:06] staying plugged in amen we have way too
[51:08] much Flo floating around jumping from
[51:11] church to church not being committed not
[51:13] being tied in not be fully engaged we
[51:16] have too much getting our feelings hurt
[51:17] and not coming to church for three or
[51:19] four weeks it's nonsense we're not
[51:21] recognizing our position and our day
[51:24] we're not recognizing the message and
[51:26] our part in the message when we do
[51:28] foolish little childish acts like that
[51:31] getting our feelings hurt and pulling
[51:33] back criticizing Brothers going around
[51:35] saying things we shouldn't be saying
[51:37] we're doing more damage than we
[51:39] realize amen we've got to be careful
[51:43] because if we if we believe we are who
[51:45] we say we are what we say counts what we
[51:47] do matters how we act has everything to
[51:50] do with what's transpiring in this
[51:54] day
[51:56] it's important friends we all have got
[51:59] to take stock with who we are and where
[52:00] we're at each one of
[52:03] us we've got to be sincere we've got to
[52:07] be
[52:09] serious we got to take a little time to
[52:11] have be
[52:16] self-reflecting amen it's not about me
[52:20] anymore it can't just be about me
[52:23] anymore it's got to be about everybody
[52:27] else aen wanted something for
[52:31] himself and look at what
[52:34] happened if we take a selfish
[52:37] attitude what are we going to
[52:41] do I don't want to be guilty myself of
[52:45] hindering the work of God say God help
[52:48] me I think one of the most wicked things
[52:51] that we can do in this day is stop the
[52:54] forward progression of the manifestation
[52:56] of the
[52:58] hour not committing
[53:00] adultery not going out and drinking not
[53:03] selling drugs I think the most wicked
[53:05] thing that we can do today is stopping
[53:08] the forward progression of the
[53:09] manifestation of the word for our day
[53:11] that's right
[53:13] amen amen
[53:19] am
[53:21] amen God said in the message 10
[53:24] virgins and the 144,000 juice this is a
[53:27] good time to read this quote you find
[53:29] out
[53:30] why said if you got a resenting audience
[53:34] the Holy Spirit won't
[53:36] reveal you got to have something that's
[53:39] working
[53:41] together they were in one place in one
[53:43] Accord and then there came a sound from
[53:45] Heaven rushing no matter how much I'd
[53:47] pray brother R's talking himself no
[53:50] matter how much I'd pray and lay day and
[53:52] night studying and praying before the
[53:54] Lord walked down there maybe the
[53:56] anointing on me walk up here and feel
[53:58] that resentment it Grieves him right
[54:02] away he won't reveal nothing but when
[54:05] you walk down here under the anointing
[54:07] and feel your audience under the
[54:09] anointing that's when the Holy Spirit
[54:11] begins to work then and he begins to
[54:13] move and do great things for
[54:17] us there's such a power that comes in
[54:22] unity this is why brother Benham
[54:24] recommended us come early to church come
[54:27] and pray get in the same Spirit don't
[54:30] come in last minute don't don't be busy
[54:32] and just rush in here and and be
[54:34] flustered but he recommended to us to
[54:37] come 30 minutes early come in early sit
[54:40] quietly get the right atmosphere and
[54:42] create the right
[54:45] atmosphere I mean so many times we
[54:48] decide what time we want to get to
[54:49] church based off what we
[54:54] want I mean it's just the
[54:57] truth I I don't want to get there early
[55:00] I I'm busy I want to do this and I want
[55:02] to do that we come to church based off
[55:04] what we
[55:05] want and we stay after and pray as long
[55:08] as we want but the question is what if
[55:11] it's not about
[55:13] me what if my coming early and creating
[55:15] an atmosphere is about the person next
[55:17] to me somebody else what if it's about
[55:21] creating the atmosphere where the word
[55:22] the gift that's in that brother can rest
[55:24] and relax and you have free
[55:29] flowing we're way too selfish as a
[55:33] people but Jesus Christ was our
[55:37] example and he gave he surrendered he
[55:42] yielded he didn't come for himself he
[55:45] came for others he didn't live for
[55:46] himself he lived for
[55:48] others and so many times we we we want
[55:52] preaching a certain style cuz that's
[55:54] what we like
[55:55] we want singing a certain way cuz that's
[55:57] what we like we want a certain amount of
[56:00] time we want a certain this we want a
[56:01] certain that and it ends up all being
[56:04] about what I want me I I think I feel I
[56:09] want we should have
[56:11] I instead of just saying God I want
[56:14] whatever you want and I want to be here
[56:16] to plug in and pull amen I want to pull
[56:18] so it'll come right amen I want to get
[56:20] connected not so I can sit here and say
[56:22] well this is wrong and that's not coming
[56:23] right and this not coming right then get
[56:24] plugged in and pull it right amen if you
[56:27] think it's going wrong pull it the right
[56:28] way amen throw your shoulder to the
[56:30] wheel pull from God and say God I need
[56:32] fed I need an answer and for me I need
[56:35] something directed to my heart amen pull
[56:37] it right out of the ministry pull it
[56:38] right out of the song service yeah I
[56:41] mean it's easy to sit and criticize and
[56:43] say this should be that way and this
[56:44] should be that way but it takes a whole
[56:46] lot more effort to engage ourselves and
[56:47] say I'm here to make a difference I'm
[56:49] here Amen to pull it correct if I think
[56:51] it's wrong pull it
[56:53] right praise God
[56:57] Amen
[56:59] so I sometimes I get disgusted at myself
[57:02] how selfish I am with my family with
[57:06] others in the church how many times I'm
[57:08] find myself preferring myself and that's
[57:11] something I think we just need to be
[57:12] aware of and guard ourselves
[57:15] against let's look at First Peter
[57:18] chapter
[57:19] 5 and we're going to begin at verse
[57:23] eight
[57:28] 1 Peter 5:8 it says be sober be vigilant
[57:34] because your adversary the Devil is a
[57:35] roaring Lyon walketh about seeking whom
[57:40] he may
[57:42] devour whom resist steadfast in the
[57:45] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[57:47] are accomplished in your brethren that
[57:49] are in the
[57:51] world this verse eight is stunning
[57:54] telling is be
[57:57] sober be
[57:58] vigilant because your adversary the
[58:01] Devil is a roaring lion walketh about
[58:02] seeking whom he may
[58:05] devour that means the devil is always
[58:09] looking for an
[58:13] opportunity I don't think he goes on
[58:15] vacation I don't think he gets days off
[58:18] the devil is always looking for an
[58:20] opportunity so we must be sober we must
[58:23] be vigilant
[58:25] because if we get laxed we could create
[58:27] an
[58:29] opportunity what's the lion when he's
[58:31] hunting what is he looking for he's
[58:33] looking for
[58:34] weakness the Lion's looking for the sick
[58:37] gazelle he's looking for the weak
[58:40] gazelle the old gazelle the young
[58:42] gazelle or the one that Strays too far
[58:46] away he's not going after the Lion's not
[58:49] going after the strong he's not going
[58:51] after the the the the multitude the
[58:53] numbers that are clean close together
[58:55] he's looking for the outlier he's
[58:57] looking for the one that's Too Young Too
[58:59] feeble too old sick weak he's looking
[59:02] for an advantage to take opportunity of
[59:05] advantage and the devil is going about
[59:08] as a ling roaring lion using the same
[59:11] tactics he's looking for an
[59:13] opportunity amen and the and I do not
[59:16] want to give him that
[59:17] [Applause]
[59:19] opportunity because he's constantly
[59:22] there he's our adversary he's constantly
[59:26] seeking whom he may devour and there's a
[59:30] there's a couple quotes that I want to
[59:31] go to and relating it from the spiritual
[59:33] the natural body to the spiritual body
[59:36] brother brandham all the way back in
[59:37] 1954 he begins to teach about sicknesses
[59:39] and cancer and he says in this message
[59:42] from 6 or 54 he says now let's think
[59:44] about cancer what is cancer then a
[59:47] cancer is another life how many knows
[59:50] that's true tumor cataract any of those
[59:52] things a germs or any other life now
[59:55] here comes in you somewhere another
[59:57] little life usually a cancer comes from
[59:59] a bruise and all the things of the
[1:00:02] natural type to spiritual so he's going
[1:00:05] to show us that the natural typees to
[1:00:07] spiritual and and many times a cancer
[1:00:10] comes into your body what's cancer
[1:00:12] looking for it's a life what's it
[1:00:14] looking for it's looking for something
[1:00:16] it can take advantage of it's looking
[1:00:19] for an open door it's looking for a
[1:00:20] weakness it's looking for an
[1:00:22] opportunity you think we we have if you
[1:00:26] have a healthy immune system you
[1:00:27] probably don't even realize how many
[1:00:29] things your immune system kicks out on a
[1:00:31] daily
[1:00:31] basis how many how many uh uh germs and
[1:00:37] viruses you come in contact with on a
[1:00:39] daily basis if we saw them floating
[1:00:40] around we'd probably be nervous how much
[1:00:42] coid is floating around and how much
[1:00:44] influenza is floating around and how
[1:00:47] many cancer Spirits you come in contact
[1:00:49] with in a day but that Spirit cannot
[1:00:52] find access to you and unless there's a
[1:00:55] weakness somewhere you know how it is
[1:00:57] many times you'll do good you You' went
[1:00:59] all winter you haven't got sick the
[1:01:01] whole family got flu and everybody else
[1:01:02] got this and they all got that and they
[1:01:04] got the cough and they got the sniffles
[1:01:06] and you didn't get anything but all of a
[1:01:08] sudden you got overworked over taxed put
[1:01:10] in some overtime didn't sleep two nights
[1:01:12] and next thing you know here comes a
[1:01:13] sore throat what was that what was that
[1:01:16] Spirit looking for it was looking for
[1:01:18] the weakness in your body to take
[1:01:20] advantage of the weakness CU with right
[1:01:22] nutrition good sleep a healthy immune
[1:01:24] system we kick out tons of
[1:01:26] stuff but when we when we when when our
[1:01:29] our nutrition's affected when our our
[1:01:31] overall wellbeing is affected there's a
[1:01:33] weakness that comes into the body and
[1:01:35] how many times you go from one sickness
[1:01:36] to the next you got one thing and went
[1:01:38] right to the next because the next thing
[1:01:39] took advantage of the weakness left over
[1:01:41] from the
[1:01:43] previous and the natural types to
[1:01:47] spiritual so in the body of Christ all
[1:01:50] these spirits that are hovering around
[1:01:52] what are they looking for they're
[1:01:53] looking for a weakness they're looking
[1:01:55] for an opportunity listen I don't ever
[1:01:57] want us to get comfortable with the fact
[1:01:59] to think we're safe and secure amen
[1:02:01] we're safe and secure in the word as
[1:02:03] long as we're staying under the word and
[1:02:05] living the word amen but what happens is
[1:02:07] there's many things that happen in life
[1:02:09] we get discouraged we get disappointed
[1:02:10] we get hurt we get weak we get tired we
[1:02:12] get stressed and we start to pull away
[1:02:14] from the body or pull out from under the
[1:02:16] word and all of a sudden that's when the
[1:02:19] enemy is going to come in and start
[1:02:21] laying something on
[1:02:23] us
[1:02:25] it's why it's important to be a healthy
[1:02:28] body so many of those spirits that are
[1:02:30] floating around are kept out just by
[1:02:34] every joint
[1:02:35] supplying just by everyone being in
[1:02:38] their post of Duty everyone doing their
[1:02:40] part and everyone contributing to the
[1:02:42] overall health of the body will keep so
[1:02:44] many spirits
[1:02:47] out he goes on in 1957 the message life
[1:02:51] is the Healer so notice the difference
[1:02:56] um water blood and spirit all the
[1:02:58] Natural Things type the spiritual then
[1:03:01] in the natural things on earth types the
[1:03:02] spiritual a cancer could be a scavenger
[1:03:05] like the Buzzard eats dead things cancer
[1:03:07] usually comes from a bruise the bruise
[1:03:10] first it's bruises and you're full of
[1:03:12] little cells and one of those little
[1:03:13] cells gets mashed it
[1:03:17] backslides if we just think about
[1:03:19] members of the body one little cell
[1:03:23] could get bruised or or backslide and
[1:03:26] that could be the entrance for a foreign
[1:03:29] life
[1:03:31] right he says when the
[1:03:34] first there is a life not the life that
[1:03:37] was there another life comes in where
[1:03:39] did it come from think of it it's not
[1:03:41] complicated where did that come from the
[1:03:42] Devil the devil cannot create nothing
[1:03:45] the devil only perverts he can't create
[1:03:46] he perverts and first he has to have a
[1:03:49] way ask the doctor if your body was
[1:03:50] perfect and like God made it in the
[1:03:52] beginning it would be impossible
[1:03:54] possible to get sick but the devil has
[1:03:56] to find a weakness somewhere to
[1:03:59] pervert so if the devil wants to harm
[1:04:03] the body of Christ he's got to
[1:04:06] find a
[1:04:08] weakness
[1:04:10] somewhere God forbid he would use my
[1:04:18] weakness but the devil has to find a
[1:04:21] weakness somewhere to pervert that's the
[1:04:24] same thing with your soul reason you
[1:04:25] don't believe in Divine Healing the
[1:04:27] devil has found a weak spot in you and
[1:04:29] he perverted it God is the Healer and
[1:04:31] we're offspring of God Sons and
[1:04:32] Daughters of God believing it like our
[1:04:34] father believed it notice this little
[1:04:36] cell it was a bruise and then a life
[1:04:38] comes in that little bruise the cell
[1:04:41] backslid he says and it backslid and the
[1:04:44] devil put a German there called cancer
[1:04:46] tumor whatever it may be and they begin
[1:04:48] to develop
[1:04:50] cells you realize that what we talk
[1:04:53] about now is one one cell backsliding
[1:04:55] one weak spot one weakness where another
[1:04:58] life can get in that life comes in the
[1:05:01] intent is never to destroy that
[1:05:06] cell the purpose is always to destroy
[1:05:09] the
[1:05:13] body it's coming in one
[1:05:16] cell but it doesn't want to stay in one
[1:05:19] cell the purpose was not the cell the
[1:05:22] purpose was to destroy the
[1:05:25] body and it'll begin to affect other
[1:05:27] cells and spread and move many times
[1:05:30] it's moving in secret underlying moving
[1:05:32] here and moving there though all of a
[1:05:34] sudden the symptoms all pop up and
[1:05:36] there's a major sickness amen you find
[1:05:38] out there's cancer leukemia or something
[1:05:40] what happened there was one Open Door
[1:05:42] there was one weakness and another
[1:05:43] Spirit came in and it never came in for
[1:05:46] that
[1:05:47] cell it always came in to destroy the
[1:05:51] body now do you see how important our
[1:05:54] spiritual life in Christ is as an
[1:05:56] individual he's never coming after you
[1:06:00] right we are so
[1:06:03] entrical all of us we're so entrical we
[1:06:06] think everything about us how I feel how
[1:06:09] I think and me and I felt this way and I
[1:06:11] felt that way and I wanted this and I
[1:06:12] wanted we're so entrical amen but really
[1:06:16] God doesn't doesn't see it that way he
[1:06:17] sees us as part of the body he sees as
[1:06:19] part of himself and everything's
[1:06:21] interconnected amen and we think that
[1:06:23] this just come to affect me it didn't
[1:06:25] come to affect you it came to destroy
[1:06:28] the body the devil's trying to find a
[1:06:30] way to stop the forward progress of the
[1:06:32] word for this age that's what he's
[1:06:35] always attempted to do that's what he
[1:06:37] did in Luther's day we trying to do in
[1:06:38] Wesley's day he was trying to stop the
[1:06:40] further progress of the word for that
[1:06:45] day and he's got to find an entry
[1:06:50] point Judas found a way into the church
[1:06:55] that spirit that was in Judas found a
[1:06:57] way into the church and it found it
[1:06:59] through Judas because Judas was had the
[1:07:01] heart of a thief yeah right is that what
[1:07:05] the Bible says he had the heart of a
[1:07:07] thief amen and that devil found entrance
[1:07:11] into where did he come in Jesus's church
[1:07:15] amen Jesus was the
[1:07:18] pastor and how did he come into the
[1:07:20] church he came into the church through
[1:07:22] Judas Judas was a thief in his
[1:07:25] heart and from there he worked the plan
[1:07:28] and what was the plan the plan was to
[1:07:29] destroy the manifestation of the word
[1:07:32] for that day he just didn't realize that
[1:07:35] he was working right in with the
[1:07:39] plan amen there's always Spirits
[1:07:41] floating around the
[1:07:44] church they were in brother brandom's
[1:07:46] day they were in Jesus's day they were
[1:07:48] in Paul's day they're in our day and we
[1:07:51] know Spirits never die right
[1:07:54] so whatever Spirit was there is
[1:07:58] here there's a Judah Spirit floating
[1:08:00] around looking for a
[1:08:02] Judas there's an Absalon Spirit floating
[1:08:05] around waiting for somebody who will
[1:08:07] play the part of Absalon there's joab
[1:08:09] Spirits looking for somebody to play the
[1:08:11] part of joab there's Deus Spirits
[1:08:13] there's there's all these Spirits
[1:08:15] floating around trying to find
[1:08:18] access how will it find access through a
[1:08:21] bruise a weakness an Open Door an open
[1:08:25] Channel and one cell yeah but it's never
[1:08:28] for one cell right it's always to
[1:08:32] destroy the
[1:08:35] body you think of it this way it's like
[1:08:38] at your home you know your home at night
[1:08:41] I mean we live in Lin so we don't always
[1:08:43] lock our doors a lot of times we forget
[1:08:44] but if you lived in a place that was
[1:08:46] dangerous had a lot of break-ins every
[1:08:48] night you would go around and make sure
[1:08:49] the windows are locked and the doors are
[1:08:51] locked because there's always thieves
[1:08:53] probing
[1:08:54] what are they looking for Access yeah
[1:08:58] right it's like the thief walks by every
[1:09:01] night while you're sleep and he tries
[1:09:02] this door locked tries this window it's
[1:09:05] locked and he makes his round and goes
[1:09:06] to the next house makes his round goes
[1:09:08] to the next house but the one day you
[1:09:12] forgot to flip the
[1:09:16] latch that's what he's been waiting for
[1:09:20] all this
[1:09:22] time you realize what a position we're
[1:09:25] in this is why we have to stay so
[1:09:28] surrendered to the word because the word
[1:09:31] is our
[1:09:32] security the word is our Shield the word
[1:09:34] is our wall the word is everything he
[1:09:37] can't get to us behind the
[1:09:41] word but the devil's always trying to
[1:09:43] get us out from around the word like he
[1:09:46] did Eve that's what I want to speak on
[1:09:50] now in the message Christ is revealed in
[1:09:53] his own word he says I was just talking
[1:09:56] to a young Minister and his wife in the
[1:09:57] room just a few moments ago and both of
[1:10:00] them are nervous just like the rest of
[1:10:01] the world rest of the human beings on
[1:10:04] Earth I said remember Satan's got a
[1:10:06] Punch coming at you don't care who you
[1:10:09] are he's got a right for that one punch
[1:10:13] which had you rather be that punch be
[1:10:15] blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair
[1:10:17] or be nervous see he's got somewhere he
[1:10:19] can punch you he's got a right to that
[1:10:21] open place now that's the spot you got
[1:10:24] to keep covered all the
[1:10:26] time this seems so I don't like this
[1:10:29] amen I want to know that there's no
[1:10:31] place he can access in me but brother
[1:10:34] REM showing us that we all have
[1:10:36] weaknesses we all have areas in our life
[1:10:39] where we've been tripped up before and
[1:10:41] listen I I'd say it this way if you've
[1:10:42] ever been tripped up in a certain way
[1:10:44] that's probably the way you've always
[1:10:45] been tripped up because that's probably
[1:10:47] a weakness that you
[1:10:50] have and so that's the spot we need to
[1:10:52] keep covered in pray prayer because we
[1:10:54] need to realize that weakness just like
[1:10:57] Paul's weakness was given to him for
[1:10:59] humility to keep him dependent upon God
[1:11:02] Amen there's things in our life that
[1:11:03] keeps us absolutely dependent upon god
[1:11:06] brother brandham had a nervous tension
[1:11:07] in his life and one time he says you
[1:11:09] know I got the feeling like pop used to
[1:11:11] say I've Got the Blues and you get the
[1:11:12] feeling down and he says I get the
[1:11:14] feeling like nobody loves me nobody
[1:11:17] cares for me he says now I know that's
[1:11:20] not true that's just me doing that
[1:11:25] that is what he said he says but I can't
[1:11:28] help it I feel that way and brother B
[1:11:31] had this nervous tension and he always
[1:11:32] wanted this nervous tension to go away
[1:11:34] and then he got to thinking one day hey
[1:11:36] it was this tension that drove me to
[1:11:38] Christ this tension is a good thing
[1:11:40] without tension what would I be I would
[1:11:42] just be a ragd dooll with no emotions
[1:11:43] nothing God's using this to keep me tied
[1:11:46] to him to keep me dependent on him and
[1:11:49] keep me close to him so there's many
[1:11:52] things in our life amen that's a
[1:11:54] weakness we have complexes and we have
[1:11:56] wrong Concepts and we have old hurts and
[1:11:58] we have things that become a weakness in
[1:12:00] our life brother B said you have to keep
[1:12:02] that covered in prayer and recognize you
[1:12:04] are not Invincible you have a weakness
[1:12:06] and you're not living for yourself that
[1:12:09] that weakness can be an open door to the
[1:12:10] enemy to trouble the whole
[1:12:12] church so now it creates a greater
[1:12:15] dependency on God than ever before
[1:12:18] because I need your help with this Lord
[1:12:20] I need you to strengthen me I need you
[1:12:21] to help me I don't want to fail in this
[1:12:24] again Lord I know that this is just my
[1:12:26] nerves amen help me to overcome help me
[1:12:28] to get Beyond
[1:12:31] this
[1:12:33] amen we need uh we need these things to
[1:12:37] keep us dependent on God because it's
[1:12:40] that independent nature that sets us up
[1:12:42] for
[1:12:42] Destruction when we think we've got it
[1:12:45] all under the wraps and everything's
[1:12:47] okay and I can't be defeated and I know
[1:12:48] what I'm supposed to be doing that's the
[1:12:50] moment you're most susceptible to be
[1:12:52] taken by by surprise amen but we need
[1:12:55] these things in our lives that cause us
[1:12:57] to say God I need you Lord cuz I'm I'm
[1:13:00] going to fall in that hole again if you
[1:13:02] don't help
[1:13:05] me and we need to keep those things
[1:13:07] covered in
[1:13:09] prayer and and brother brandham it comes
[1:13:12] to the message standing in the Gap and
[1:13:14] he says I let the sick lay I wanted the
[1:13:18] Lord to tell me where to go and what not
[1:13:19] to do that's wrong I had built myself a
[1:13:22] complex
[1:13:23] because the people didn't hear my
[1:13:26] message I want to talk about complexes
[1:13:28] for a minute brother Brenham he he I
[1:13:33] love the message he was so open and so
[1:13:36] honest and so truthful it helped us so
[1:13:38] much Amen to understand even ourselves
[1:13:42] he says he we know when he comes to
[1:13:43] standing in the Gap he had already just
[1:13:45] preached the seals standing in the Gap
[1:13:47] is preached in June of 1963 in March of
[1:13:50] 63 he comes and preaches the seals and
[1:13:52] when he comes and and and preaches the
[1:13:54] seals for brother brandom that's an
[1:13:55] extremely momentous time amen because
[1:13:58] they've been pondering and wondering
[1:14:00] could this ministry be Malachi 4 could
[1:14:02] this be amen the Fulfillment of the word
[1:14:05] for our day could this be the Elijah
[1:14:07] Ministry and he thinks so and he's
[1:14:08] questioning and he's looking at it but
[1:14:10] as soon as he can go over to Revelations
[1:14:12] 10 1-7 and see the mighty Angel come
[1:14:14] down and reveal amen the unspoken word
[1:14:17] to lift the seals off of what was in the
[1:14:19] back part of God's mind he knew right
[1:14:21] then this is a revelation 10:1 7 and the
[1:14:24] and the messenger of Revelation 10:7 is
[1:14:27] Malachi 4 he could tie it together and
[1:14:29] now he knew what he had wondered about
[1:14:31] all his life he knew that's why when
[1:14:33] brother bam came to the seven seal he
[1:14:35] said oh friend you don't know what this
[1:14:36] means to me all my life I've wandered of
[1:14:38] all things I appreciate those other six
[1:14:40] why because this is his seal he's the
[1:14:43] messenger of the seven seal amen the
[1:14:45] seven seal is the opening of the word
[1:14:47] amen when he comes to that now he knows
[1:14:49] his identification he knows his place in
[1:14:51] the scripture he knows he's not guessing
[1:14:53] he
[1:14:54] knows such a marvelous time for this man
[1:14:58] amen and what happens immediately after
[1:15:00] that
[1:15:04] rejection they don't believe
[1:15:06] it and even if they even if they're not
[1:15:11] unbelieving they're not catching
[1:15:13] it they're not getting the gravity of it
[1:15:17] his even his friends are not recognizing
[1:15:20] what this means or what the significance
[1:15:22] is
[1:15:23] and brother brandom slips into
[1:15:27] depression and he says
[1:15:30] himself I built myself a
[1:15:35] complex I love the way he words
[1:15:38] that because we think sometimes that we
[1:15:40] just got a complex like we got the cold
[1:15:43] but brother B said I built myself a
[1:15:49] complex he shared the blame for
[1:15:51] it he wasn't willing to pass it off on
[1:15:54] somebody else I built my why did he
[1:15:56] build himself a complex because he was
[1:16:00] hurt he was
[1:16:04] rejected he goes on to say a little
[1:16:07] further down standing in the Gap he says
[1:16:09] Moses lost the feeling of his people
[1:16:12] because they wouldn't listen to him and
[1:16:14] brother Roy you see your dream brother
[1:16:17] Roy Roberson had a dream of brother
[1:16:18] brandom he was at the head of a table he
[1:16:19] was lifted up and carried out west and
[1:16:21] when he came back amen he been changed
[1:16:23] and he looked like the immortal Moses
[1:16:25] with a white hair and a beard at the
[1:16:27] head of the table and that was his dream
[1:16:29] he said brother Roy you see your dream
[1:16:31] and brother bram's typing it back to
[1:16:33] Moses Moses had to go to the Wilderness
[1:16:35] he lost the feeling for his people and
[1:16:37] he ran out into the Wilderness but God
[1:16:39] had to change his heart and bring him
[1:16:41] back to be the Redeemer and now he's
[1:16:43] tying that to brother Roy Robinson's
[1:16:45] dream which he's attaching the standing
[1:16:47] in the Gap he said now you can't go with
[1:16:50] a Ministry like that I can't go go with
[1:16:53] a Ministry like that until I feel
[1:16:55] different in my heart about it no matter
[1:16:59] if God did tell me but that is that
[1:17:02] change brother Roy that you've seen
[1:17:06] coming brother brandham had to go
[1:17:08] through a change like Moses went through
[1:17:10] a
[1:17:11] change what was happening and standing
[1:17:13] in the Gap was brother bham had come
[1:17:15] through this highlight of his ministry
[1:17:17] where all his questions now about
[1:17:19] himself are
[1:17:20] answered and then it's rejected whale or
[1:17:24] not understood or
[1:17:27] misunderstood and the rejection left him
[1:17:29] lonely and
[1:17:31] hurting and he starts devising a plan
[1:17:34] where he can get away and I'll say it in
[1:17:38] my own words and I hope I'm free to say
[1:17:39] this he wants to get away from the pain
[1:17:42] of
[1:17:44] rejection so he comes up with a plan
[1:17:46] where he can run up to Northern British
[1:17:48] Columbia he wants to be a guide and help
[1:17:51] out bud Southway he said want to be
[1:17:53] great said I'll let my beard grow out
[1:17:55] won't have to get a haircut just hunting
[1:17:58] fish he said it'll be great and then if
[1:18:00] God gives me a message this is where the
[1:18:01] religious part comes
[1:18:03] in because none of us want to move away
[1:18:06] from God without having religious
[1:18:09] reasons to do
[1:18:11] it this is where Hey listen I I don't
[1:18:14] think any of us are just going to wake
[1:18:16] up one morning and decide I'm just going
[1:18:18] to fail God fail the church and I'm
[1:18:19] going to just be an open door for
[1:18:21] spirits to come in no all the sudden the
[1:18:23] devil is so slick he begins to paint it
[1:18:25] in religious
[1:18:30] reasoning that's so deceptive friends
[1:18:34] and brother brandom starts thinking you
[1:18:36] know you called me to be a prophet and
[1:18:37] those prophets didn't fool around with
[1:18:39] the people they just went out to the
[1:18:40] Wilderness they stomped out with a
[1:18:41] message and went back and I'm going to
[1:18:43] be like an Old Testament prophet and all
[1:18:45] of these things he's thinking and he's
[1:18:47] mulling over as he's driving down the
[1:18:48] road and we know God comes and corrects
[1:18:50] him and stops him and says you know you
[1:18:53] you you weren't called to be just that
[1:18:55] you were called in the apostolic way you
[1:18:57] have more gifts than that amen and and
[1:18:59] he says if you go up there he said your
[1:19:01] wife won't stay up there she'll leave
[1:19:03] she won't stay up like that and you'll
[1:19:04] become a bum and all of the we know it
[1:19:06] so well I'm not going to rehearse it all
[1:19:08] but all of these things would happen and
[1:19:09] if if God said they would happen I
[1:19:11] believe they would have
[1:19:12] happened I don't know how to sort that
[1:19:14] out with predestination but God's not
[1:19:16] lying
[1:19:19] yeah gives him an identification of who
[1:19:22] he is shows him this name written in the
[1:19:24] mountain with the highs and the lows and
[1:19:25] the valleys and the Peaks and begins to
[1:19:28] understand all these things has to be
[1:19:29] this way and now he comes back and
[1:19:31] preaches standing in the Gap and
[1:19:33] standing in the Gap he's taken the
[1:19:35] correction he knows he's wrong he knows
[1:19:37] because of a complex he lost the feeling
[1:19:40] for the
[1:19:42] people and he knows that he was wrong
[1:19:44] and God corrected him and he's got to go
[1:19:46] back amen but he says but my heart has
[1:19:49] to
[1:19:50] change I can't go back this way I've
[1:19:52] I've lost the feeling for the people he
[1:19:55] said you see something something's got
[1:19:56] to change me because I in my heart if I
[1:19:59] go out there feeling the way I do now I
[1:20:02] still feel that they ought to have heard
[1:20:04] that message they ought to have done it
[1:20:07] and I don't have the feeling for the
[1:20:09] people that I should
[1:20:11] have who was brother Brandon primarily
[1:20:14] feeling
[1:20:16] for
[1:20:19] himself the Trap was laid by getting him
[1:20:22] to try to protect
[1:20:24] himself guard himself avoid the
[1:20:29] pain that was the
[1:20:31] Trap and as a human being I don't blame
[1:20:34] him one
[1:20:35] drop I can't condemn my brother CU who
[1:20:39] wants to go through the pain he went
[1:20:44] through but I he lost the feeling for
[1:20:46] the
[1:20:47] people his own hurt diminished the
[1:20:50] feeling for the rest of the body
[1:20:54] I don't have the feeling for the people
[1:20:55] that I should have until I get that
[1:20:58] feeling there's no need in me going CU
[1:21:00] I'd be a
[1:21:01] hypocrite and all these years I've tried
[1:21:04] to serve him with a true heart and I
[1:21:05] won't go out there being a hypocrite I
[1:21:08] got to feel that it isn't Ricky and
[1:21:09] Retta and it isn't this Bunch it's God's
[1:21:12] children that's in bondage and I must go
[1:21:14] to
[1:21:16] them you think
[1:21:18] about this man he got this
[1:21:21] complex
[1:21:23] and it's the question is where did this
[1:21:25] come from and brother Bren tells us in
[1:21:28] the message a guide from 62 he says I
[1:21:31] was thinking the other day no more than
[1:21:33] a few years ago standing down here on
[1:21:34] the street and because that my family
[1:21:36] had done wrong no one would talk to me I
[1:21:40] was lonesome for Fellowship nobody
[1:21:42] wanted anything to do with me they said
[1:21:45] he's his daddy is a boot Bootlegger and
[1:21:48] the Lord's saw no one would talk to me
[1:21:51] and I loved people
[1:21:54] brother Brenham was a little boy was
[1:21:56] wounded by
[1:21:58] rejection by a bad family name by his
[1:22:01] father being alcoholic and a bootlegger
[1:22:03] by their poverty by the condition of his
[1:22:05] clothes by all of those things he
[1:22:08] something said in his heart where he had
[1:22:11] scars he had wounds in his heart because
[1:22:14] he had a rejection
[1:22:16] complex I want to read to you the
[1:22:19] definition of a
[1:22:21] complex
[1:22:23] in a
[1:22:25] complex it the word complex is a complex
[1:22:30] word so it has multiple
[1:22:32] meanings but in the context that we're
[1:22:35] using it in this is the definition
[1:22:37] there's two parts Part One a group of
[1:22:40] repressed desires and memories that
[1:22:44] exerts a dominating influence Upon A
[1:22:47] personality so a group of repressed that
[1:22:50] means they're not really on the surface
[1:22:52] they're laying back there repress
[1:22:54] desires and
[1:22:56] memories that exerts a dominating
[1:22:59] influence Upon A
[1:23:02] personality so why was brother Brenham
[1:23:05] so hurt with rejection because he had
[1:23:07] been so rejected as a
[1:23:10] child then part two this is another
[1:23:13] there's another definition of complex an
[1:23:16] exaggerated reaction to or preoccupation
[1:23:20] with a subject or
[1:23:23] situation an exaggerated reaction to or
[1:23:26] a preoccupation with a subject or
[1:23:30] situation so if you think about that
[1:23:31] kind of complex you can have a complex
[1:23:34] about your
[1:23:35] appearance the size and shape of your
[1:23:37] nose the color of your complexion the
[1:23:39] color of your hair your weight your
[1:23:42] skills or abilities or lack of skill you
[1:23:44] can have a complex about all of those
[1:23:45] things and what it is is an exaggerated
[1:23:48] reaction to or a preoccupation with a
[1:23:51] subject or situation
[1:23:53] till you're so preoccupied with your
[1:23:55] appearance you're afraid to go out in
[1:23:56] public when there's nothing wrong with
[1:23:57] your
[1:23:58] appearance there's nothing actually
[1:24:00] wrong amen there's something about your
[1:24:02] features that you don't like and wish
[1:24:03] was different and this one's prettier
[1:24:05] you get something worked up in your mind
[1:24:06] there's actually no problem but you
[1:24:08] create a
[1:24:10] problem and it's an over it's an
[1:24:12] exaggerated reaction or preoccupation
[1:24:14] with a subject or
[1:24:17] situation
[1:24:19] so or a group of repress desires and
[1:24:23] memories that exerts a dominating
[1:24:26] influence upon the
[1:24:28] personality you know that first one
[1:24:30] sometimes is so subtle we don't
[1:24:32] recognize it we don't know sometimes why
[1:24:35] we react the way we react to things we
[1:24:37] haven't put our finger on it we can't
[1:24:39] pinpoint it amen and sometimes we may
[1:24:42] never be able to pinpoint it we may
[1:24:44] never be accurately able to diagnose it
[1:24:48] but the one thing that I want to watch
[1:24:49] for is I want to watch for the reaction
[1:24:51] to it
[1:24:52] because I think that's how we'll begin
[1:24:54] to recognize whether I'm being motivated
[1:24:56] right or motivated wrong CU sometimes we
[1:24:59] don't really know what motivates us
[1:25:01] sometimes it's so hard to discern
[1:25:02] ourselves there's things that's happened
[1:25:05] that shaped us from childhood and we're
[1:25:06] reacting to that and we don't even know
[1:25:08] we're reacting to that so it becomes
[1:25:10] that's why it's called complex comp it's
[1:25:12] complicated it's complex it it's
[1:25:14] multifaceted and sometimes is so hard to
[1:25:17] figure out amen and and sometimes you
[1:25:19] can drive yourself mad trying to figure
[1:25:20] it out and I I'm here to say don't try
[1:25:22] to figure it out just look for the
[1:25:24] direction everything's pushing you in
[1:25:26] and try to discern what's behind it
[1:25:28] based off where it's pushing
[1:25:33] you brother
[1:25:36] brandham his
[1:25:38] complex first of all he built the
[1:25:41] complex this current one but it was fed
[1:25:44] from an old complex yeah from childhood
[1:25:47] because brother benam goes on in the
[1:25:49] quote that I read he goes to say no one
[1:25:51] would talk to me I was lonesome because
[1:25:52] my dad was a bootlegger and I love
[1:25:54] fellowship and I long for fellowship and
[1:25:56] he says now I got so many friends I got
[1:25:58] to go out in the woods and hide amen
[1:25:59] because everybody loves me but now amen
[1:26:01] then that was in 1962 now he comes to
[1:26:03] standing in the Gap and saying
[1:26:05] everybody's rejected me and I'm hurt and
[1:26:06] I want to run away from everybody again
[1:26:08] so you can see the boy went from low to
[1:26:10] high back to low and it ties him right
[1:26:13] back to a former
[1:26:18] pain so here he is but what's the
[1:26:24] motivation he's actually being motivated
[1:26:27] to run away from his commission that an
[1:26:29] angel gave him right said you have a
[1:26:33] gift of healing to take to the peoples
[1:26:35] of the
[1:26:36] world
[1:26:38] right he has lost the feeling for his
[1:26:42] brethren for the
[1:26:43] people and he's willing to deceive his
[1:26:47] wife through a deception to get her
[1:26:49] trapped into going up there with him
[1:26:53] and he's got a religious reason because
[1:26:56] the prophets of old amen but the
[1:26:58] religious reason is just a covering for
[1:27:00] all the selfish reasons amen oh God help
[1:27:04] us to look at
[1:27:06] ourselves we have done this again I
[1:27:09] should say I have done this again and
[1:27:11] again and again and again I get hurt I
[1:27:15] don't like something I react somewhere I
[1:27:17] come up with a religious reason and
[1:27:19] really the underlying issue is me I'm
[1:27:21] trying to say me I'm trying I was hurt
[1:27:24] they said something about me I'm
[1:27:25] protecting me I'm trying to get away
[1:27:27] from pain I don't want to hurt anymore
[1:27:29] and so I create this whole world this
[1:27:31] whole scenario amen where brother
[1:27:33] brandham is actually overreacting to the
[1:27:35] situation amen because the whole world
[1:27:37] hasn't left him he comes right back in a
[1:27:39] few weeks and he's preaching his church
[1:27:41] loves him all the people still love him
[1:27:43] they still show up at meetings he has
[1:27:45] exaggerated the whole thing in his
[1:27:50] mind wow he may have heard a few
[1:27:53] comments and he may have had some people
[1:27:55] not understand and it's always that's
[1:27:57] always the way it goes amen I'll preach
[1:27:59] a sermon amen it doesn't matter how many
[1:28:01] people tell me they love it one person
[1:28:03] said I didn't understand a word you said
[1:28:05] brother Chad and I messed up for a
[1:28:09] week right it can be it can be one
[1:28:13] comment and then you can exaggerate that
[1:28:16] and make it
[1:28:17] everybody everybody I've been so
[1:28:20] rejected and they don't understand me
[1:28:22] and blah blah blah and whine whne whine
[1:28:25] and the reality is I'm just feeling
[1:28:26] sorry for myself and the truth is you
[1:28:29] come back to next service and preach and
[1:28:30] everybody likes and the people are still
[1:28:32] there and still saying amen it's you do
[1:28:34] you exaggerate it in your own
[1:28:37] mind you build a complex and and to
[1:28:40] build a complex you have to receive a
[1:28:42] lie at some point you have to receive a
[1:28:44] lie and so the the question is who's
[1:28:47] giving you the LIE amen and so I I I
[1:28:50] think of it this way the Devil's over
[1:28:52] here and he's got all these lies and
[1:28:54] they're bricks and he gives you a brick
[1:28:55] and you know nobody loves you and
[1:28:58] brother BM takes this brick and he slap
[1:29:00] some mortar on it nobody loves
[1:29:04] me Devil's over here they should have
[1:29:06] listened to you because of all the
[1:29:08] Vindication said they should have
[1:29:10] listened to me because of all the
[1:29:18] Vindication who built the complex he did
[1:29:22] who handed him the
[1:29:26] lies to build a complex at some point
[1:29:28] you have to receive
[1:29:30] lies yeah amen nobody loves me that is
[1:29:33] so far from the truth friends yeah right
[1:29:37] I don't know if anybody on this planet
[1:29:38] that nobody
[1:29:40] loves you see there are always extreme
[1:29:42] statements nobody will listen to me
[1:29:45] nobody cares nobody understands that's
[1:29:48] not even
[1:29:50] reasonable that's just the way we feel
[1:29:52] yeah so we've received a lie and the
[1:29:55] lies become truth and we place it in our
[1:29:57] wall of
[1:29:59] complex and we build ourselves a complex
[1:30:03] amen I say God free us from such
[1:30:08] nonsense let's go back to
[1:30:11] Genesis I want to look at this in the
[1:30:13] beginning Genesis chapter
[1:30:20] 3
[1:30:27] oh my goodness I love the word of
[1:30:30] God you know I love I love when the word
[1:30:33] of God peels me away like a banana and
[1:30:36] I'm so exposed I don't even have any
[1:30:38] place to hide and I don't even have an
[1:30:40] excuse I can't even all I can do is hang
[1:30:42] my head and say God forgive me I can't
[1:30:45] even make an excuse for it
[1:30:49] anymore Genesis 3 verse one now the
[1:30:53] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[1:30:55] of the field which the Lord God had made
[1:30:57] and he said unto the when yeay hath God
[1:30:59] said You shall not eat of the every tree
[1:31:01] of the garden and the woman said unto
[1:31:03] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[1:31:05] the Trees of the garden but of the fruit
[1:31:07] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[1:31:08] garden God has said You shall not eat of
[1:31:10] it neither shall you touch it lest you
[1:31:13] die and the serpent said unto the woman
[1:31:16] ye shall not surely die for God does
[1:31:19] know that in the day you eat thereof
[1:31:21] then your eyes shall be open and you
[1:31:23] shall be as Gods knowing good and evil
[1:31:26] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:31:28] good for food and that it was pleasant
[1:31:29] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:31:31] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:31:33] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[1:31:36] her husband with her and he did eat and
[1:31:38] the eyes of them both were open and they
[1:31:40] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[1:31:41] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:31:46] aprons I'd like to propose to you that
[1:31:51] the fall came came because the serpent
[1:31:53] gave Eva complex
[1:31:55] yes in the very beginning the serpent
[1:31:59] gave her a complex and she took
[1:32:02] it because he began to say to her you
[1:32:06] know you're not really going to die but
[1:32:09] God does
[1:32:11] know that the day you eat thereof what's
[1:32:14] he doing he's saying God's keeping
[1:32:17] something from
[1:32:20] you you know there's something
[1:32:23] else to this Mystery of Life and God's
[1:32:27] keeping it from
[1:32:31] you and all of a sudden it
[1:32:34] says after he handed her the the complex
[1:32:39] and she took
[1:32:40] it she began to look at that tree
[1:32:44] again it was pleasant to the
[1:32:48] eyes good for food a tree desirable B to
[1:32:51] make one
[1:32:52] wise she was believing the Serpent's lie
[1:32:57] that God was keeping something from
[1:33:03] her you say why didn't she just go talk
[1:33:07] to
[1:33:08] Adam why did she go to the serpent
[1:33:11] before she went to Adam amen because
[1:33:14] that's what happens when you get a
[1:33:16] complex you think if God's keeping me
[1:33:19] from it Adam
[1:33:22] may keep me from
[1:33:24] it and now she wanted it this is what
[1:33:28] brother renom says says Eve did not want
[1:33:30] to do that but he showed her how it was
[1:33:33] more wisdom in it she didn't know she
[1:33:35] wanted to know she didn't understand but
[1:33:38] she wanted to understand and God told
[1:33:40] her not to try to
[1:33:43] understand in the seat of discrepancy he
[1:33:46] says now this is Harvest Time at the
[1:33:48] beginning when God swed his seed upon
[1:33:49] the Earth and gave it in the hearts of
[1:33:53] his children his family to keep the word
[1:33:56] that was their only defense keep that
[1:33:57] word here comes the enemy and broke that
[1:34:00] barrier by sewing the seed of
[1:34:01] discrepancy contrary to the word of
[1:34:04] God how did the serpent get Eve to move
[1:34:08] out from behind the word where he
[1:34:10] couldn't touch her amen he gave her a
[1:34:12] complex that God was withholding
[1:34:14] information from her you're not going to
[1:34:17] die that's not it but God does know amen
[1:34:20] and all of a sudden why didn't she wait
[1:34:22] and ask God because the prophet tells us
[1:34:24] that God would come in the cool of the
[1:34:25] evening and walk in fellowship with his
[1:34:27] children every evening why didn't she
[1:34:28] just wait and listen this is my personal
[1:34:31] belief you don't have to take it but I
[1:34:32] don't believe this was a oneoff
[1:34:34] conversation with the serpent I don't
[1:34:37] believe it just one time I believe this
[1:34:39] was a matter of discourse when he when
[1:34:41] he started telling her you know there's
[1:34:43] more you know there's something else you
[1:34:45] know God knows there's there's another
[1:34:47] Revelation beyond what you have you know
[1:34:49] there's more to this whole thing than
[1:34:50] what you see and I don't know how many
[1:34:52] conversations I don't know how long but
[1:34:54] this is just me personally I don't
[1:34:56] believe it was one conversation because
[1:34:58] remember now all of a sudden she wants
[1:35:01] it amen she wants that knowledge she
[1:35:03] wants that wisdom she wants what's ever
[1:35:06] being kept from her now she wants it and
[1:35:08] if now God is the one keeping it from
[1:35:10] her she will not go to God
[1:35:14] yeah if you become convinced that God is
[1:35:17] keeping something from you then you
[1:35:18] don't go to God Amen and if you can find
[1:35:22] if you can create a division between her
[1:35:24] husband and her now she doesn't even go
[1:35:26] to Adam she takes the ACT first and then
[1:35:28] goes to Adam because maybe Adam is on
[1:35:30] God's side you see how a complex brought
[1:35:33] the entire division by bringing a lie to
[1:35:35] her and she took the lie and believe the
[1:35:37] lie amen because now she all of a sudden
[1:35:40] was being held back she could have more
[1:35:42] and now she doesn't go to her husband
[1:35:45] she doesn't go to God Amen now she
[1:35:47] starts to look at the tree yeah right
[1:35:52] amen the fall in the beginning came by a
[1:35:56] complex and now all of a sudden we see
[1:36:00] over and over and over again the same
[1:36:03] pattern in
[1:36:07] us the devil gets us to believe
[1:36:10] something it's not at all
[1:36:13] true we tried to get her to believe
[1:36:15] wasn't true it wasn't that God was
[1:36:17] holding something back it God had a plan
[1:36:20] for her God had perfect plan for her and
[1:36:22] she was already a god upon the Earth
[1:36:25] yeah right but he twisted her mind and
[1:36:28] believing things uh about God and about
[1:36:31] the word and all of a sudden she left
[1:36:33] the word and how did she how could she
[1:36:36] know that she was receiving a complex
[1:36:38] because she was willing to go against
[1:36:40] the word amen because of what she now
[1:36:42] believed she was willing to go against
[1:36:44] the
[1:36:48] word what was brother brandham willing
[1:36:50] to do brother brandham didn't want want
[1:36:51] to go up to BC to be a sinner he didn't
[1:36:53] want to go up there to reject the word
[1:36:55] amen but he was walking away from a
[1:36:57] god-given commission he was leaving the
[1:36:59] people he had a gift of healing to the
[1:37:01] peoples of the world and that's what he
[1:37:02] said he said I let the sick people lay I
[1:37:04] got to get back out there I got to get
[1:37:06] back I got a gift of healing to give to
[1:37:08] them amen that was his original
[1:37:09] commission God had told him what to go
[1:37:11] do and now he's taking it upon himself
[1:37:14] to change the direction and go a
[1:37:16] different direction he's moving away
[1:37:18] from what God told him to do that's how
[1:37:20] you can concern that this is a
[1:37:23] complex say what about what about us
[1:37:25] brother Chad because anytime something
[1:37:28] will get you to leave the ABCs amen you
[1:37:31] know it's wrong amen something that will
[1:37:33] get you to leave Fellowship it's
[1:37:35] wrong because we're not to forsake the
[1:37:37] assembling together of ourselves amen
[1:37:39] even the more so as that day approaches
[1:37:42] that's a commandment and brother Brenham
[1:37:43] said amen that commandment drives us
[1:37:45] into church we should have a heart to
[1:37:47] get to church every time the doors open
[1:37:49] and if our heart's not there he said we
[1:37:51] need to get to
[1:37:52] praying but when all of a sudden our
[1:37:54] heart turns from there and we don't want
[1:37:56] to be in the fellowship that doesn't
[1:37:58] mean that God won't move You from One
[1:37:59] Church to the other God has the Liberty
[1:38:01] to move his sheep wherever that's not
[1:38:02] what we're talking about but when we
[1:38:04] start laying out a church and not
[1:38:06] connecting and becoming disconnected I
[1:38:08] if I would search that out I would say
[1:38:10] there's a complex there somewhere and
[1:38:12] somebody's believed a
[1:38:14] lie somebody has received and accepted a
[1:38:17] lie and they're disbelieving something I
[1:38:20] had a sister come to me one time and she
[1:38:22] was so troubled about something that was
[1:38:23] happening in the church many years ago
[1:38:25] and she says this happened this brother
[1:38:27] came from this church to this church and
[1:38:29] that influenced this and and you decided
[1:38:31] to do that and you did that because of
[1:38:33] what that brother did in other church
[1:38:35] and the whole thing was a complete
[1:38:39] fabrication complete 100% there wasn't a
[1:38:42] threat of Truth in it at
[1:38:45] all but she saw things and connected
[1:38:49] them and what happened was she she had a
[1:38:51] complex from a previous Church she was
[1:38:54] at she had an overbearing Pastor who
[1:38:56] took control and the whole church fell
[1:39:00] apart now she's
[1:39:02] afraid and so she's on the
[1:39:04] lookout anytime she saw something that
[1:39:06] she didn't understand then all of a
[1:39:08] sudden all of a sudden she worked up a
[1:39:10] whole scenario that was not true yeah
[1:39:19] amen what's he looking for
[1:39:22] an Open Door a bruised cell a
[1:39:27] weakness the minute that that we can get
[1:39:30] pulled off the word the minute that we
[1:39:33] can think it's all right to
[1:39:36] gossip there's a complex driving that
[1:39:39] somewhere the minute I can speak evil or
[1:39:42] critical of another brother without
[1:39:43] going to that brother and talking to
[1:39:44] them just talk to other brothers there's
[1:39:46] something driving me to that cuz that's
[1:39:48] not the
[1:39:49] word the that I can lay out a church and
[1:39:52] not go and be comfortable just bailing
[1:39:53] out and not going anywhere there's
[1:39:55] something wrong something's driving that
[1:39:58] you say what is driving that because the
[1:40:00] word says don't forsake the assembling
[1:40:02] together that's the word now there's
[1:40:04] something in me that doesn't want me to
[1:40:05] come to the word what's driving that is
[1:40:07] it an old pain from childhood is it
[1:40:09] because of something somebody said is it
[1:40:11] a rejection pain is it a hurt what is
[1:40:13] what is causing me to want to pull back
[1:40:16] from the body what is causing me Amen to
[1:40:18] want to speak evil to somebody what is
[1:40:21] going on Amen that I am going down this
[1:40:24] path I think we need to stop and say
[1:40:25] what is pushing me because this isn't
[1:40:28] the
[1:40:29] word that's not the
[1:40:34] word amen we may not be able to figure
[1:40:37] out what our complex is we may not be
[1:40:38] able to figure out what happened to us
[1:40:39] as a childhood but we can certainly
[1:40:41] figure out the moment we step off the
[1:40:43] very ABC's basics of the word go to
[1:40:45] church pay your tith love the Brethren
[1:40:48] speak nice things about one another no
[1:40:50] gossip no back back biting I mean those
[1:40:52] are the simplest when we move off of
[1:40:53] that we need to say wait a minute
[1:40:55] something's going on
[1:40:57] here something's pushing me out from
[1:41:01] around the word and you know what it's
[1:41:03] never just about
[1:41:05] me the devil's trying to destroy the
[1:41:08] body bring in through a brw cell another
[1:41:13] life and through that other life
[1:41:18] spread God say God please help
[1:41:22] us please Lord help us we've been
[1:41:26] wounded we've been rejected we've been
[1:41:30] mistreated is that true that's all true
[1:41:33] brother Brenham was wounded rejected
[1:41:37] mistreated and it left in him a
[1:41:41] susceptibility and if the prophet of the
[1:41:43] age was
[1:41:45] susceptible what do you think about you
[1:41:47] and
[1:41:49] I if he was acceptable to actually move
[1:41:52] out of God's program and hinder the
[1:41:55] forward progress of the word for his
[1:41:58] day yes sir what about you and I is
[1:42:02] there a susceptibility in
[1:42:04] us could God use old hurts and Old
[1:42:07] Wounds and old pain and
[1:42:09] misunderstandings could he bring a new
[1:42:11] hurt that matches an old hurt like he
[1:42:14] did with brother
[1:42:15] Brandon to cause us to do something
[1:42:19] against the word
[1:42:21] to cause us to do something that would
[1:42:24] hinder the forward
[1:42:26] progress of the manifestation of the
[1:42:28] word for this
[1:42:32] day be
[1:42:34] sober be
[1:42:36] vigilant for your adversary the devil
[1:42:40] Werth about as a roaring Lyon seeking
[1:42:43] whom he may
[1:42:45] devour and he doesn't want one
[1:42:49] member
[1:42:52] that's you know Satan didn't want
[1:42:55] Eve he wanted to destroy the whole
[1:43:02] plan praise
[1:43:05] God praise God this Bible is so
[1:43:11] perfect we are weak we are
[1:43:14] needy but God give us the Simplicity of
[1:43:17] his word to keep us
[1:43:19] right things in our minds become so
[1:43:22] complicated the way we feel the way we
[1:43:24] view things they become sometimes so
[1:43:27] complicated we misund understand
[1:43:29] situations we misjudge things we believe
[1:43:32] things that aren't true all because of
[1:43:34] complexes and all because of our own
[1:43:35] ideas and things can get so complicated
[1:43:38] in our own mind amen that we don't know
[1:43:40] what's going on Amen and the reality is
[1:43:42] we may never figure out what's going
[1:43:43] forget about what's going on just what's
[1:43:45] driving me to do what is it driving me
[1:43:47] to stay with the word is it driving me
[1:43:49] to stay with a fellow Fellowship is it
[1:43:51] driving me to stay in Harmony and unity
[1:43:53] or is it moving me elsewhere if it's
[1:43:55] moving me elsewhere I got a
[1:43:58] problem
[1:43:59] am
[1:44:03] simple is something moving me to become
[1:44:06] a disjointed
[1:44:08] joint is something moving me to stop
[1:44:11] being a member of the body that's here
[1:44:14] for the edification of itself in love is
[1:44:16] there something detaching me causing me
[1:44:18] not to coales and knit but to become
[1:44:20] unknit if there's something doing that
[1:44:22] there's something wrong motivating me
[1:44:29] somewhere brother
[1:44:30] bham he's got this quote I want to read
[1:44:33] this quote but before that I want to go
[1:44:34] to 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:44:49] 12
[1:44:52] as I stand Here preaching this I tremble
[1:44:55] because I know that I'm the most
[1:44:57] susceptible of
[1:44:59] all if you think about it friends none
[1:45:02] of us are strong or powerful have our
[1:45:05] act together whether we're a preacher or
[1:45:07] a pastor or a deacon a teacher an elder
[1:45:10] someone's served the Lord 40 50 years
[1:45:13] none of it matters we're all
[1:45:16] susceptible and if God if the enemy
[1:45:18] wants to destroy the Devil
[1:45:21] do you think that I should be less
[1:45:25] Vigilant
[1:45:26] myself you think he doesn't want to
[1:45:28] check my windows and my doors in my life
[1:45:32] cuz why it's not even about me he wants
[1:45:34] to destroy the
[1:45:37] body if you can get into one of those
[1:45:39] five Ministry offices how much
[1:45:40] destruction can you
[1:45:44] do if you want to get into an elder
[1:45:47] brother or an elder sister who's highly
[1:45:48] respect how much damage can there that
[1:45:50] do you want to get into somebody with a
[1:45:53] gift on the platform how much damage can
[1:45:55] that
[1:45:57] do really I stand Here trembling because
[1:46:01] we have a devil a roaring Lon seeking we
[1:46:03] can destroy and he's just looking for an
[1:46:05] opportunity he's looking for an Open
[1:46:07] Door he's looking for a weakness and we
[1:46:08] all have them including
[1:46:12] me
[1:46:14] amen I get wounded with rejection just
[1:46:16] like anybody else gets wounded with
[1:46:18] rejection I get hurt when things are
[1:46:20] said and things are done just like
[1:46:21] anybody else gets hurt but my goodness
[1:46:23] if it begins to drive me to
[1:46:25] disfellowship and drives me to hate a
[1:46:27] brother and drives me I realize there's
[1:46:29] something going wrong because this is
[1:46:30] not the Holy
[1:46:34] Ghost God help us all amen that that we
[1:46:37] don't become the open door I say God
[1:46:39] help me that I'm not the access point
[1:46:42] for a
[1:46:43] devil please
[1:46:45] God and any one of us can be that's
[1:46:49] right
[1:46:51] when he comes to chapter 12 1
[1:46:53] Corinthians chapter 12 he begins to talk
[1:46:55] about the gifts and the working of the
[1:46:56] body and the Natural Body typing the
[1:46:58] spiritual body we've been through all of
[1:47:00] this but he comes to the end in verse 31
[1:47:02] of chapter 12 he says but cover
[1:47:04] earnestly the best gifts and that means
[1:47:07] uh cover earnestly the best gifts means
[1:47:09] to earnestly seek the most beneficial
[1:47:12] gifts that's what it means not the best
[1:47:15] gift as far as I got promoted to the
[1:47:18] best gift that's not the mentality at
[1:47:19] all that this one's higher than that it
[1:47:22] actually means the most beneficial gift
[1:47:25] seek to be the most benefit to the body
[1:47:28] that you can be that's what he's
[1:47:31] saying he says yet show I unto you a
[1:47:37] more excellent
[1:47:38] way next verse though I speak with the
[1:47:42] tongue of men and angels and have not
[1:47:44] love I become a sounding brass or
[1:47:47] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[1:47:49] gift of Prophecy and understand
[1:47:50] understand all Mysteries and all
[1:47:51] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:47:53] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:47:55] not love I'm nothing and though I bestow
[1:47:58] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[1:48:00] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:48:02] charity it profiteth me nothing charity
[1:48:07] love suffereth long now we're going to
[1:48:09] look at the attributes of love because
[1:48:10] every one of these gifts must be
[1:48:12] ministered in love because the body must
[1:48:14] be edified together in love seeking the
[1:48:18] bond of the spirit and the unity of love
[1:48:20] love everything should be done with
[1:48:24] love love suffereth
[1:48:28] long that means love is patient with the
[1:48:31] other members of the body
[1:48:34] yeah and is
[1:48:37] kind love envieth not doesn't get
[1:48:41] jealous when God uses somebody else and
[1:48:44] not themselves you have to realize
[1:48:47] friends any time somebody gets picked
[1:48:49] for something it means other people
[1:48:51] didn't get
[1:48:53] picked that's where this comes into play
[1:48:56] Love envieth
[1:49:00] Not says love vaunteth not itself it
[1:49:05] doesn't promote
[1:49:06] itself is not puffed
[1:49:09] up does not behave itself
[1:49:13] unseemly seeketh not her
[1:49:15] own it is not easily provoked and
[1:49:19] thinketh no
[1:49:20] evil love rejoices not in iniquity but
[1:49:24] rejoices in the truth love beareth all
[1:49:27] things believeth all things hopeth all
[1:49:30] things endureth all things love never
[1:49:35] faileth but whether there be prophecies
[1:49:38] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:49:40] they shall cease whether there be
[1:49:41] knowledge it shall vanish
[1:49:44] away all of these gifts must be
[1:49:47] administered by love no Envy no vaunting
[1:49:52] no puffed up doesn't seek its own like
[1:49:56] we said the first service when we
[1:49:57] preached this I don't know of any member
[1:49:59] in my body that exist to take care of
[1:50:02] itself but every member in my body exist
[1:50:06] to provide something for other members
[1:50:08] of the
[1:50:10] body why am I here I'm not here for
[1:50:13] myself I'm here for others we each one
[1:50:16] are here not to serve ourselves not to
[1:50:19] protect our El make ourselves happy or
[1:50:21] bring pleasure to ourselves we have been
[1:50:23] knit to the body to be a joint that
[1:50:25] supplieth to make sure we're here
[1:50:28] edifying the body in itself and
[1:50:32] love whatever moves me away from that is
[1:50:37] wrong whatever is preventing that in my
[1:50:39] life that expression is anti-
[1:50:46] word Jesus said to his disciples before
[1:50:49] he Departed he said this is my
[1:50:52] commandment that you love one another as
[1:50:56] I have loved
[1:50:58] you but as a tall order friends we're
[1:51:02] supposed to love each other the exact
[1:51:03] way Jesus loved us how did Jesus love us
[1:51:07] he gave up his reputation he gave up
[1:51:10] Heaven he gave up Glory he gave up honor
[1:51:13] he gave up Prestige he came to Earth to
[1:51:15] be mocked spit on ridiculed killed
[1:51:19] that's how he loved us amen and we're
[1:51:22] supposed to love each other that way
[1:51:27] yep said greater love hath no man than
[1:51:30] this that a man laay down his life for
[1:51:33] his
[1:51:34] friends question is can we love like
[1:51:37] Jesus that means can I give up my life
[1:51:41] for the
[1:51:43] body can I Surrender my happiness my
[1:51:49] prestige my honor my good
[1:51:52] name my self-
[1:51:54] protection can I be hurt for the
[1:51:57] body Jesus
[1:52:00] was can I stand there and get stepped on
[1:52:04] when it's crushing my heart for
[1:52:05] everybody else that's how Jesus loved us
[1:52:09] amen he didn't preserve or protect
[1:52:11] himself he gave himself God so loved the
[1:52:15] world he gave if we're to love the way
[1:52:19] God loved
[1:52:20] we give we're not here to take we are
[1:52:24] here to
[1:52:27] give the devil
[1:52:30] uses all of these things all of our
[1:52:33] makeup our nature our path he uses it
[1:52:35] against us and what is he trying to do
[1:52:37] he's not trying to destroy you and I
[1:52:38] friends I'm sure he loves to destroy any
[1:52:41] attribute of God but he's here to kill
[1:52:44] the program of
[1:52:45] God he here to destroy the body why are
[1:52:49] we here here to promote the
[1:52:53] body brother Bram said in the seventh
[1:52:56] seal said it's an old battle that
[1:52:58] started way back Beyond
[1:53:00] Time Satan and his angels was kicked out
[1:53:03] and then they come to earth and the
[1:53:04] battle set in again because Eve broke
[1:53:06] down the barrier from where she was
[1:53:07] isolated behind the word of God and from
[1:53:10] that very hour Satan won the battle over
[1:53:13] God's word because one of his subjects
[1:53:16] the weaker let down the bar and that's
[1:53:19] EX exactly how he's won the battle every
[1:53:22] time has been because one of his
[1:53:24] subjects let down the bar from the
[1:53:27] word how has Satan won the battle every
[1:53:30] time because a whole church because 10
[1:53:33] subject because one of his
[1:53:37] subjects let's make this
[1:53:40] personal Satan will win the battle over
[1:53:43] God's word when I let down the bar on
[1:53:46] the
[1:53:48] word I be become personally
[1:53:52] responsible for the program of God in
[1:53:55] this
[1:53:56] generation can't put it off on other
[1:53:58] people's shoulders it rests squarely on
[1:54:00] my
[1:54:01] shoulders that one subject letting down
[1:54:05] the bar on one word brought brought
[1:54:09] defeat Satan had victory over the word
[1:54:11] of God and that's how he's had it every
[1:54:13] time when one of his subjects let down
[1:54:16] the bar on one
[1:54:18] word
[1:54:21] we should be on
[1:54:23] guard be vigilant be
[1:54:26] sober because he's as a roaring ly
[1:54:28] circling what's he waiting for a moment
[1:54:31] of
[1:54:32] weakness
[1:54:34] laxness why to destroy the move of God
[1:54:38] brother bham come in the message Christ
[1:54:40] is the mystery of God revealed and
[1:54:43] before he preaches Christ as the mystery
[1:54:45] of God revealed you have to think
[1:54:47] brother brandham goes through preaching
[1:54:48] of the seals March
[1:54:51] 1963 then he has all this between that
[1:54:54] time he has the rejection and the hurt
[1:54:55] and he comes and standing in the Gap at
[1:54:57] the end of June June 23rd 1963 and then
[1:55:01] he's telling us what he's been dealing
[1:55:03] with and he's been hurt and how he's
[1:55:04] going to run away and all of these
[1:55:06] things how God corrected him and here he
[1:55:08] comes almost exactly one month later
[1:55:10] July 28th and now he's going to give the
[1:55:13] church some really good advice right
[1:55:14] before he breaks down the seven
[1:55:16] seal he says love one another above
[1:55:20] everything love one another no matter
[1:55:23] what the devil tries to say now you're
[1:55:25] all one great big sweet group now but
[1:55:28] remember my warning Satan won't let that
[1:55:30] stay that way no sir he'll shoot
[1:55:32] everything if he has to bring somebody
[1:55:34] in to make his Target he'll bring some
[1:55:36] critic or unbeliever in and sit him down
[1:55:39] and cause him to fellowship with you
[1:55:40] under quietness and things and then
[1:55:42] he'll shoot that guy with some kind of
[1:55:43] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[1:55:45] church with it don't you take sides with
[1:55:48] it don't you have nothing to do with
[1:55:50] anything else you stay right loving
[1:55:52] sweet and kind to one another what is
[1:55:55] that that's the immune system of the
[1:55:57] body
[1:55:59] working pray for that man that he'll be
[1:56:02] saved too or that woman or whoever it is
[1:56:04] just pray for them and stick one with
[1:56:06] another stay with your pastor he's the
[1:56:09] shepherd and you give him respects he'll
[1:56:11] lead you through and call because he's
[1:56:13] ordained of God to do so now do you
[1:56:16] remember that the enemy will come listen
[1:56:19] brother B's not saying it might you got
[1:56:21] to watch out for this just in case he's
[1:56:23] not giving a just in case speech he's
[1:56:25] telling you this is going to happen this
[1:56:26] is what you need to
[1:56:29] do the enemy will come and when he does
[1:56:32] just cling that much closer together and
[1:56:35] the one that the devil's using for an
[1:56:36] enemy will either get out or come in and
[1:56:38] be one of you that's all don't never
[1:56:41] Clan among or talk and make yourself
[1:56:43] clan we are one I couldn't say left hand

[1:56:47] away cuz you're not a right hand he he's
[1:56:49] my left hand I want him to stay there
[1:56:51] even the little tip of my finger I want
[1:56:53] to stay right there every little part of
[1:56:56] my body stay right there and God wants
[1:56:58] us as a body of Believers to stay right
[1:57:01] exactly with one another right at with
[1:57:04] one another is that what God wants
[1:57:07] that's what God wants what's the enemy
[1:57:09] trying to do he's trying to stop God
[1:57:11] from having what he wants right it's
[1:57:14] that simple and now you've got tapes on
[1:57:16] that you've got tapes on what we believe
[1:57:18] you've got tapes on discipline in the
[1:57:20] church how we behave ourselves in the
[1:57:22] Church of God how we got to come here
[1:57:24] together and sit together in Heavenly
[1:57:25] places don't stay home if God is in your
[1:57:28] heart you can't hardly wait for them
[1:57:30] doors to open out yonder to get in here
[1:57:32] to have fellowship with your brothers if
[1:57:34] you don't feel that way then I tell you
[1:57:36] it's time you got to
[1:57:38] praying cuz we're in the last days
[1:57:41] listen brother B didn't say just
[1:57:43] overcome your feelings and come to
[1:57:44] church no he said pray and find out
[1:57:45] what's going on till your feelings
[1:57:47] change he didn't say just be a hypocrite
[1:57:50] stuff it and fake it that's not what
[1:57:51] brother B's saying he said if you don't
[1:57:53] feel that way you better get to praying
[1:57:55] something's
[1:57:56] wrong something could be wrong in a
[1:57:58] relationship with a brother something
[1:57:59] could be wrong with yourself something's
[1:58:01] wrong somewhere if we don't feel that
[1:58:05] way don't just fake it don't just
[1:58:07] swallow it down don't just come because
[1:58:09] brother B said if if God's in my heart
[1:58:12] listen let's be real if God's in my
[1:58:15] heart I'll be there every time the doors
[1:58:16] open I want everybody to know God's in
[1:58:18] my heart and you're coming for the the
[1:58:19] wrong reason because you want people to
[1:58:20] see that God's in Your Heart
[1:58:23] Right but if you don't really feel that
[1:58:27] way it's time we got to praying because
[1:58:29] something's wrong because this isn't we
[1:58:32] should have love one for another and a
[1:58:35] desire to fellowship with one another
[1:58:37] and if that begins to dissipate
[1:58:39] something else is coming in that's
[1:58:45] wrong he said cuz we're in the last days
[1:58:48] where the Bible exhorted us to much more
[1:58:50] as we see the day approaching to love
[1:58:52] one another with Christian love and
[1:58:54] divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:58:56] together in Heavenly places with Christ
[1:58:58] Jesus and love one another this will all
[1:59:00] men know you're my disciples when you
[1:59:02] have love one for another that's right
[1:59:04] stay right together if the brother you
[1:59:06] think he's a little wrong or the sister
[1:59:08] say Lord don't let me never have the
[1:59:10] root of bitterness spring up because
[1:59:12] it'll affect him and it'll take the
[1:59:14] Christ right out of my
[1:59:18] life
[1:59:20] how many times we live with those little
[1:59:22] roots of bitterness brother B said it'll
[1:59:24] take the Christ right out of my
[1:59:27] life that poison acid of malice and
[1:59:30] jealousy and hatred that we just take
[1:59:32] the Holy Spirit right away from you
[1:59:34] it'll run him from the Tabernacle here
[1:59:36] it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it
[1:59:38] away from here hurt your pastor it'll do
[1:59:40] everything don't you do that you just
[1:59:43] wax that much closer together take the
[1:59:46] Buckle as the brother testified and
[1:59:47] Minister here the other night about
[1:59:49] about having a buckle seeing it in a
[1:59:50] vision the buckles on the whole armor of
[1:59:52] God just pull her on tighten up move
[1:59:54] right up close to one another love one
[1:59:56] another anyhow talk nice about one
[1:59:59] another say nice things about one
[2:00:01] another and then God will bless
[2:00:04] you what is that that's the immune
[2:00:06] system of the body loving one another
[2:00:08] sticking with one another caring for one
[2:00:13] another
[2:00:15] amen oh praise God there's so much we're
[2:00:18] just going to we're just going to let
[2:00:20] some things
[2:00:22] go but let's go to Luke chapter 4 let's
[2:00:25] finish
[2:00:35] here Luke chapter
[2:00:42] 4 verse
[2:00:48] 17 and there was delivered unto him the
[2:00:51] book of the prophet Isaiah when he had
[2:00:53] opened the book he found the place where
[2:00:55] it was written the spirit of the Lord is
[2:00:57] upon me because he anointed me to preach
[2:01:00] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[2:01:02] heal the
[2:01:04] brokenhearted I love this we talk so
[2:01:08] much about The Healing Ministry of Jesus
[2:01:09] Christ but Jesus says he sent me to heal
[2:01:12] the
[2:01:13] brokenhearted
[2:01:17] amen and to preach Deliverance to the
[2:01:19] captives and the recovery of sight to
[2:01:22] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[2:01:25] are
[2:01:27] bruised to priest the acceptable year of
[2:01:29] the
[2:01:30] Lord what a
[2:01:33] Ministry Jesus comes to bind up the
[2:01:36] Brokenhearted to set at Liberty those
[2:01:38] are captive you know sometimes we're
[2:01:40] captive by things that happened to us in
[2:01:41] the past captive by memories captive by
[2:01:45] emotions and Jesus come to set the
[2:01:47] captives free am he's come to bind up
[2:01:50] the Brokenhearted many of the things we
[2:01:52] react to and the things we struggle with
[2:01:54] is because of wounds broken
[2:01:57] heart and he also came to set at Liberty
[2:02:01] them that were
[2:02:03] bruised how does a cancer come many
[2:02:05] times a
[2:02:07] bruise but oh Christ is here to heal the
[2:02:11] bruise so we don't have to walk around a
[2:02:14] wounded Spirit a bruised Spirit
[2:02:16] susceptible for the enemy to come in say
[2:02:19] oh God keep me close to you I've been
[2:02:23] wounded I've been hurt would you pour
[2:02:24] the balm of Gilead into my heart cuz now

[2:02:28] everybody
[2:02:29] else I can't continue to go on nursing
[2:02:32] this hurt holding this bitterness I
[2:02:34] can't go on with this anymore because
[2:02:36] it'll take the Christ right out of my
[2:02:38] life it'll affect my brother it will
[2:02:39] drive Christ that God out of the church
[2:02:41] it'll do so many negative things I can't

[2:03:00] come in Matthew 8:16 it says when the
[2:03:03] even was come they brought unto him many
[2:03:05] that were possessed with devils and he
[2:03:08] cast out the spirits with his
[2:03:11] word and healed all that were
[2:03:14] sick I believe God has sent his word
[2:03:17] today to cast out Spirits amen amen
[2:03:19] things that would hinder us things that
[2:03:21] would cause us to disconnect from the
[2:03:24] body or Harbor bitterness or allow
[2:03:26] complexes to to to cause us to believe
[2:03:29] lies and separate fellowship or or cause
[2:03:32] a an open window where the devil can get
[2:03:34] in I believe he's come to cast out
[2:03:36] Spirits with his
[2:03:38] word to set us free we don't have to
[2:03:42] continue fearing relationships we don't
[2:03:44] have to continue fearing rejection we
[2:03:47] don't have to continue being suspicious
[2:03:49] of everybody in
[2:03:50] leadership just because it was wrong in
[2:03:52] the past doesn't mean it's going to be
[2:03:53] wrong again we can't live suspicious of
[2:03:56] the pastor suspicious of the deacon we
[2:03:58] can't live suspicious of our brother and
[2:04:00] sister we can't live that way that's not
[2:04:03] a healthy
[2:04:04] church we can't live amen with a towards
[2:04:07] one another we can't live amen with with
[2:04:10] not wanting to be fully engaged that's
[2:04:12] not going to work this is not the day we
[2:04:14] live in we have to have some Freedom so
[2:04:16] we can plug all the way in amen amen and
[2:04:20] be a joint that
[2:04:22] supplieth now my personal responsibility
[2:04:25] the responsibility of Chad
[2:04:28] Lamb is to see this body built in love
[2:04:33] and to be a joint that suppli and
[2:04:36] anything in my emotion realm my past my
[2:04:39] H anything that would disrupt that is
[2:04:43] wrong and I want it to go away and I
[2:04:46] need to seek God if I've got something
[2:04:48] that's hindering that and I can't just
[2:04:50] get over it I need to get to praying
[2:04:51] because something's got to get out
[2:04:53] before I do damage to other people right
[2:04:57] and that's true for each one of us we
[2:04:59] are each one personally responsible for
[2:05:03] the building of the body the edifying of
[2:05:06] the body together in itself in love and
[2:05:10] that's why we're
[2:05:12] here God may use you one time this way
[2:05:15] and another time that way he may use you
[2:05:17] every time the same way it doesn't

[2:05:44] is I say God help
[2:05:47] me I don't want to be a window I want to
[2:05:49] be a
[2:05:50] wall I don't want to be a trap door and

[2:12:00] stunned she works at the school with
[2:12:03] sister Deb John's they both are teachers
[2:12:06] and their caddy corner across the hall
[2:12:08] from one another this is Jade's first
[2:12:10] year at the school and and sister Deb
[2:12:12] goes over and introduces herself to her
[2:12:14] and and she begins to befriend her and
[2:12:15] tell her if you need anything you can
[2:12:16] come to me and I you ask me any
[2:12:18] questions and I'm here to help and so
[2:12:21] they struck up a friendship and Deb just
[2:12:23] befriended her and was kind to her and
[2:12:25] helpful and sister Jade has always had a
[2:12:28] heart for the God from from the time she
[2:12:30] was a young girl she would go to church
[2:12:32] by herself even her parents didn't go
[2:12:33] she would walk to the local church she
[2:12:36] got old enough to drive she would drive
[2:12:37] to church and she's been to several
[2:12:38] churches she told us but she said she
[2:12:41] got concerned about the world condition
[2:12:44] and how bad it was so she got on the
[2:12:46] internet and started looking up end time
[2:12:47] Pro
[2:12:49] prophecies and she came across a book by
[2:12:51] Owen jurgenson called Supernatural the
[2:12:53] life of William Brandon and she bought
[2:12:56] book
[2:12:57] one and she read book one and she took
[2:13:00] it to school one day and she walked
[2:13:02] across the hallway to Deb John and she
[2:13:04] says do you know anything about William
[2:13:14] brandom God is seeking out his children
[2:13:18] God is finding them as Beyond a needle
[2:13:20] in a Hy stack friends Beyond put the
[2:13:23] odds together that I could you can't
[2:13:25] even run the statistics on it amen it
[2:13:27] wasn't that Deb was witnessing to her
[2:13:29] she was witnessing by her life and she
[2:13:30] never mentioned brother brandom she
[2:13:32] asked her do do you know anything about
[2:13:34] William Brandon I would have been
[2:13:36] stuttering i' uh uh uh uh maybe
[2:13:39] something you
[2:13:41] [Music]
[2:13:43] know we've seen God do this with many
[2:13:46] people that are here several God has
[2:13:48] just grabbed you and pulled you in he
[2:13:50] found you he sought out his children and
[2:13:54] he brought them here and if God brought
[2:13:56] his children here I say God if you've
[2:13:57] entrusted this tender lamb here let us
[2:14:00] create the environment where that lamb
[2:14:01] can grow into your full measure cuz now
[2:14:04] I'm responsible for her
[2:14:07] growth should be serious about these
[2:14:11] things I had a brother overseas I was
[2:14:13] sharing with him some testimonies that
[2:14:15] were here and the brother said something
[2:14:16] to me that was struck me funny he said

[2:14:20] net and fish come

[2:14:25] the fish are jumping in the boat I mean
