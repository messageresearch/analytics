TRANSCRIPT
========================================
as a husband let's say I don't know what to do as a father I don't know what to do so what am I going to do I'm going to apply the token to that office and I'm going to say Lord there's more than me here I may not know what to do but you know what to do so I'm going to apply the Life of Christ the life the token to that office and you watch things happen you your children may be in a place where you don't know what to do with them but if you apply the token to that office it's like God stepping into that office where all things are possible nothing is impossible for him and he simply does what you can't do it's a token life is the token must be applied it must be applied in every office that we hold and through the application of the token things happen things that you didn't think would happen happen Peter was expecting the same results he was expecting Lord we've see it all night we've dropped this Net 10 times we've dropped this net we're tired that I mean we've washed the Nets we've we're done for the day there's no fish here Lord I know what I'm doing but at Thy word Lord I'll apply the word to this oh I'll do what you want me to do I'll do what you're telling me to do he was expecting the same results but lo and behold he got different results because sometimes we don't even know what result we need we don't even know what the answer should be so how how can we expect an answer when we don't know what the answer is we don't have a clue we don't know Lord I don't know what to do many times as a pastor you come to that place where he said Lord I don't know what to do I don't know what the answer is amen but we apply the token and the answer comes God brings the solution amen apply applying the token applying the token people that they'll they'll cut there is a time and now is whether that Supernatural element like in rahab's house it doesn't mean that that's at the end time houses have fallen to the curse of this world already look down your street and tell me how many are still standing I don't mean in a physical way I mean in a spiritual way they've Fallen to the spirits of this world but for some reason on your street there's this one particular house that hasn't fallen why is that it's because there's a supernatural element to that house the supernatural element is in this house and it's not in that house but it's God's grace that the Supernatural is a part of your home [Music]
