[19:11] being a little bit shifted for me I just
[19:13] pulled the trigger yesterday and made a
[19:15] final decision or Sunday made a final
[19:17] decision Sunday evening and uh we'll do
[19:19] it tomorrow for those who can make it in
[19:21] the fellowship hall at 630 we'll get
[19:23] into the next part of the church age

[19:39] remember that in prayer as well amen we
[19:41] want to remember brother Michael and
[19:43] sister Maran as they head home that
[19:44] we'll be praying for them on Friday may
[19:46] God bless you we've enjoyed having you
[19:48] and take our love back home amen man God
[19:52] bless you let's look at Genesis chapter
[19:56] 3 uh chapter 3
[20:02] :4 Genesis 3:4 the serpent said unto the
[20:05] woman you shall not surely die for God
[20:08] does know that in the day you eat
[20:10] thereof then your eyes shall be open and
[20:12] you shall be as Gods knowing good and
[20:14] evil and when the woman saw that the
[20:16] tree was good for food and that it was
[20:18] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[20:20] desired to make one wise she took the
[20:23] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[20:25] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[20:29] amen God bless you as you have your
[20:30] seats may God bless us as we look at his
[20:33] word
[20:34] amen so I want to continue on from
[20:37] Sunday and uh but I have a different
[20:40] title and I want to conclude with maybe
[20:41] something a little different a little
[20:42] different angle but the same theme the
[20:44] same thought uh in some ways and for a
[20:47] title I'd like to take the seed and the
[20:49] garden the seed and the garden and then
[20:52] a subtitle controlling life and uh uh
[20:56] hopefully we'll it'll all come together
[20:58] I just trust trust that God will bring
[20:59] it all together for us when we look here
[21:02] we want to remember what we were talking
[21:04] about uh on Sunday we were talking about
[21:07] the rise of the woman how the woman is
[21:09] coming to power and control in this end
[21:11] time and we know it's a spirit it's the
[21:13] spirit of the false church it's the
[21:14] spirit the female dominating Spirit
[21:17] that's taking over the entire world and
[21:19] we see it manifest so many ways and as I
[21:21] was uh going through that on Sunday and
[21:23] meditating on it and doing some more
[21:25] reading it just kept growing and growing
[21:27] and so they're just one more aspect I'd
[21:29] like to bring to your attention I want
[21:31] to re read a quote from the thyon church
[21:34] age that I read Sunday uh out of the
[21:37] church age book it said it is most
[21:39] worthy of note that the very name thyra
[21:41] means dominating female thus this age is
[21:44] characterized by a dominant force a
[21:46] force that ruthlessly invades all
[21:48] conquers all and despotically controls
[21:51] now a dominating female is the greatest
[21:53] curse in the world I think that's
[21:56] amazing that brother Bram said of all
[21:57] the greatest curse in the world is a
[21:59] dominating female and uh we talked about
[22:02] it Sunday but I just want to uh review
[22:04] so we can carry on Amen all the way back
[22:07] in the Garden of Eden I mean this is why
[22:09] brother Brandon when he makes these
[22:11] statements he makes statements and he
[22:13] makes strong statements and and and and
[22:16] uh and he really starts to really labor
[22:18] on the condition of the world the the
[22:21] condition of society the condition of
[22:23] women the things that were changing all
[22:25] around him in politics and society and
[22:28] in churches and he starts to show the
[22:31] condition of things and there's a and
[22:33] because the prophet is seeing a spirit
[22:35] behind it he's seeing the spirit of the
[22:37] church falling away and it's showing up
[22:39] on the women in a physical way and so he
[22:42] really starts to rail on this and he
[22:43] starts to to Really labor and spend time
[22:46] on it amen and and and and I love it
[22:49] because it seems in some ways especially
[22:52] if you read it with a a mindset of 2024
[22:55] it seems like he's so hard and so
[22:57] straight but he knows exactly what he's
[22:59] talking about amen because he sees
[23:01] Spirits behind things and why they are
[23:03] the way they are and he can tie what
[23:06] he's seeing today with what happened in
[23:08] the Garden of Eden amen because there
[23:11] the woman took the leadership outside of
[23:13] the leadership of a man and outside the
[23:15] leadership of a woman outside the
[23:17] leadership of the word she took
[23:19] leadership and brought death and brought
[23:21] ruination and that's what happens every
[23:24] time the woman takes the lead and so
[23:26] there's all types of woman there's a
[23:28] nation is a woman a church is a woman a
[23:31] a mother and a wife is a woman amen and
[23:33] so we ourselves as the church are typed
[23:35] as the woman and whenever the woman
[23:37] takes the lead or takes control outside
[23:40] of the headship of the word it'll bring
[23:43] death and so brother R is is is nailing
[23:46] these things down in the culture social
[23:49] issues news issues he's looking at these
[23:52] things and and they they're not just
[23:54] news to him they're not just political
[23:56] happenings they're not just a change in
[23:58] Society to him it's showing the
[24:01] condition of the world at the end time
[24:03] because that Spirit that's been going
[24:05] all along and growing is coming to
[24:08] fullness and the same thing's true for
[24:10] us he began to point it out so that we
[24:12] can now see it again in the tharan
[24:14] church as he said from the Garden of
[24:16] Eden onward women has constantly and
[24:19] successfully tried to take control over
[24:22] the man so that's been a problem that's
[24:25] been a battle that's been going on for
[24:27] ages and here we find it hey friends
[24:29] it's coming to its
[24:31] climax it is absolutely coming to its
[24:33] climax it is all around us brother benam
[24:36] said uh how many years ago 60 years ago
[24:38] it's a woman's world and I'm telling you
[24:40] it's it's the way it is right now we see
[24:43] that environment all around us and and
[24:46] let's look at Genesis chapter 2 now
[24:48] let's go
[24:49] back Genesis chapter
[24:54] 2 and verse 21 Genesis 2 and 21 and the
[24:58] Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[25:00] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[25:02] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[25:04] instead thereof and the rib which the
[25:06] Lord God had taken from man made he a
[25:08] woman and brought her unto the man and
[25:11] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[25:13] and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[25:15] called woman because she was taken out
[25:18] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[25:20] father and mother and shall cleave unto
[25:21] his wife and they shall be one flesh so
[25:25] all the way back in the beginning God he
[25:28] had had given a command to the man to
[25:30] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[25:31] then then he had formed the man into a a
[25:35] a a vessel of the earth he made him
[25:37] flesh and put him in the uh Earth in the
[25:39] garden and then he found that the man
[25:41] was alone and he said it's not good that
[25:43] man shall be alone I will make a help
[25:45] meat for him so God is the one who's
[25:47] instituting all of these things amen he
[25:49] put man in flesh but inside the man was
[25:52] both men male and female amen inside one
[25:55] vessel but God was going to separate now
[25:58] the feminist spirit and he took a rib
[26:00] out of Adam and split the feminist and
[26:02] masculine Spirit put the feminist Spirit
[26:04] into the woman and now he United back
[26:07] together Amen in what brother B said
[26:08] called the the the first the first Union
[26:10] the first marriage all the way back in
[26:12] the Garden of Eden so it shows that it's
[26:14] God's institution it's God's plan it's
[26:17] God's desire it's God's way and he said
[26:20] that now he he he he saw that the man
[26:23] was alone so he made a help me for the
[26:26] man and now there's a prophecy of
[26:29] multiply and replenish and the woman no
[26:31] doubt knows the prophecy but but the but
[26:33] the serpent comes along to beguile the
[26:36] woman and begins to get her to look at
[26:38] this thing she's not supposed to look
[26:40] to and and he says for God does know in
[26:44] the day you eat thereof then your eyes
[26:45] shall be open and you shall be as Gods
[26:47] knowing good and evil so he tempted her
[26:49] with this saying and brother mam says
[26:51] she thought she was doing right she was
[26:53] trying to do right she was trying to
[26:55] keep the word but she went down the road
[26:57] of reason reing an intellect in her own
[27:00] feelings and she left the headship of
[27:03] the word amen to do so it says and then
[27:07] the woman saw the tree was good for food
[27:09] here we go right to the senses right to
[27:11] the
[27:12] intellect she saw that it was good for
[27:14] food that was pleasant to the eyes and a
[27:16] tree to be desired to make one wise and
[27:18] she took the fruit thereof and did eat
[27:20] and gave also into her husband with her
[27:21] and he did eat right there the woman
[27:25] took the
[27:27] leadership and it brought
[27:29] death she went before the B she went
[27:31] first she went outside of headship and
[27:33] she took the leadership she took
[27:35] control she took control of the
[27:38] situation not because she wanted to be
[27:40] evil but because she thought she was
[27:41] doing good but she went down the road of
[27:42] reasoning and feelings and senses and
[27:46] she took control she took the leadership
[27:49] and she brought
[27:50] death amen so we're on the same page
[27:53] praise God let's keep going now in the
[27:56] church age book in the pergan church age
[27:59] section we read just a bit of this
[28:01] before but it's the section where the
[28:03] angel told Brother bam to pick up his
[28:04] pen and write and so in the church age
[28:07] book it's an it's it's italicized
[28:09] because he said it's a message amen from
[28:11] the uh from the Lord to his bride to the
[28:14] church and so he says the first son Adam
[28:18] was the spoken seed word of God he was
[28:20] given a bride to reproduce himself that
[28:24] is why the bride was given to him to
[28:25] reproduce himself to produce another Son
[28:28] of God but she fell she fell by
[28:31] hybridization she caused him to die amen
[28:35] so why was the woman given to the man
[28:38] was it because God saw the man was
[28:40] lonely he made a help me for him but he
[28:41] was given a wife to reproduce himself
[28:45] that's why she was given all right we're
[28:47] together let's keep moving 1 Corinthians
[28:51] 11 I just want to lay in a little
[28:53] Foundation here and start building off
[28:55] of it 1 Corinthians 11
[29:04] in verse 8 1 Corinthians
[29:10] 11:8 Paul is going to bring us back to
[29:13] this understanding and he's going to
[29:15] he's teaching the church here 1
[29:18] Corinthians 11:8 for the man is not of
[29:20] the woman but the woman of the man that
[29:22] goes all the way back to Eden she's come
[29:24] out of the man neither was the Man
[29:26] created for the woman but the woman for
[29:28] the man for this cause ought the woman
[29:30] to have power on her head because of the
[29:32] Angels nevertheless neither is The Man
[29:35] Without The Woman neither the woman
[29:37] without the man in the Lord for as the
[29:39] woman is of the man even so is the man
[29:42] also by the woman but all things of God
[29:45] so now the man never came uh from the
[29:48] woman but the woman was from the man and
[29:51] thenan the man wasn't made for the woman
[29:52] but the woman was made for the man to
[29:54] serve a purpose to be a help meet and to
[29:56] help him reproduce himself on the the
[29:58] Earth all right but now because they
[30:02] chose they chose sex by sex desire God
[30:04] said if you want to go that way then
[30:06] that's fine and so now amen now that's
[30:09] that's how reproduction is coming upon
[30:11] the Earth amen from the time of the Fall
[30:13] so now he's saying that that man is now
[30:16] not independent of the woman because man
[30:18] has now come through the woman The Woman
[30:21] come out of the man she's from the man
[30:22] he's not from her and he's not for her
[30:25] she's for him but he's not independent
[30:27] of her because now if any man's going to
[30:29] be born on the Earth he's got to come
[30:30] through the woman there's a
[30:34] partnership so that a man can reproduce
[30:36] himself upon the Earth and in order to
[30:38] reproduce himself upon the Earth he's
[30:40] going to have to have a wife he's going
[30:41] to have to have a woman he's going to
[30:43] have to have a womb there's going to be
[30:44] a womb somewhere that he can so seed
[30:46] into to reproduce himself upon the Earth
[30:50] all right there we go praise
[30:53] God now I want to read this quote
[30:58] uh and why we are not a denomination
[31:00] from 1958 said that's all we can do but
[31:03] look
[31:04] Brethren then God reconciled or
[31:06] recognized Abraham's Faith he give him
[31:08] the seal a sign of circumcision as a
[31:11] seal of the Covenant see he said now
[31:13] Abraham I recognize your faith so I'm
[31:15] going to give you a sign now that I have
[31:18] received you so he circumcised Abraham
[31:20] and that was a seal of the Covenant and
[31:23] now in this day now a woman could not be
[31:26] in that Covenant only a married
[31:29] woman well it's obvious that a woman
[31:31] couldn't be in it because the sign of
[31:33] the Seal of the Covenant was
[31:34] circumcision and a woman can't receive
[31:36] circumcision so the only way she can is
[31:38] under the headship of her father who's
[31:41] under the Seal of circumcision or under
[31:43] the headship of her husband who's under
[31:45] the Seal of circumcision but a woman
[31:47] independently couldn't be under that
[31:49] seal without
[31:51] headship
[31:53] amen and so now I want to read that
[31:56] again now a woman could not be in the
[31:57] covant and only a married woman we find
[31:59] out couldn't circumcise a female so it
[32:02] had to come in so her and her husband
[32:06] are one they're not no more two they are
[32:09] one how many knows that the scripture
[32:11] says so so her being married then she
[32:13] become one and go on down here and look
[32:15] over here in Timothy said the same thing
[32:17] now not withstanding she shall be saved
[32:20] in childbearing if she continues in
[32:22] faith and Holiness with all
[32:25] sobriety so as I was uh look looking at
[32:28] this whole uh scene this political scene
[32:30] and the social scene that's going on all
[32:32] around and looking at the things that
[32:33] brother Brenham had said and all the
[32:35] things that we went into Sunday there
[32:37] was something that kept popping up over
[32:38] and over as a major theme through this
[32:41] last political season and it had to do
[32:43] with Reproductive Rights for women I
[32:46] don't know if you know that was a major
[32:48] issue it was a major issue and and and
[32:52] there come a motto that said my body my
[32:55] choice my body my choice voice and it
[32:58] was all about abortion it was all about
[33:00] uh uh uh birth control and the woman's
[33:03] right to control her own body amen but I
[33:05] began to look at this because it becomes
[33:07] a major issue and it had to become a
[33:09] major issue because we're in the end
[33:12] time and and everything has to come to
[33:15] full full fruition or full manifestation
[33:18] in the end time and I began to look at
[33:20] this and and I I I read an article back
[33:23] in July uh of this year where the
[33:26] Republican Party changed their platform
[33:28] that they had for 40 years where on the
[33:30] platform they were dedicated to
[33:32] reversing Row versus Wade amen and and
[33:34] putting a ban on abortion but in July
[33:38] under the uh uh under the headship of
[33:40] Donald Trump they knew they couldn't win
[33:42] an election that way because of the
[33:44] popular vote of
[33:45] women women have the power in this
[33:48] country I'm telling you statistically
[33:51] they've got 53% of the vote they have
[33:54] the majority vote women have the
[33:55] majority vote so they have to to the
[33:58] desire of the women in order to win an
[34:00] election so Donald Trump could not run
[34:02] on this platform so he gets the
[34:05] Republican party to abolish that and he
[34:07] does it cleverly getting it off his
[34:09] hands by saying it's a state issue not a
[34:12] federal issue we'll push it off to the
[34:14] states and they have to deal with it
[34:16] amen it wasn't be oh my goodness it was
[34:18] a political move so that he could win an
[34:21] election because of the popular vote of
[34:24] women has everything to do with women
[34:27] yes they're controlling the whole
[34:31] show
[34:33] amen and so when they did that they put
[34:35] it off to the states well I watched in
[34:38] this last election they had 10 state
[34:40] issues 10 different states had issues on
[34:42] abortion on and it wasn't whether to
[34:44] allow it or not they all already allow
[34:47] abortion it was either to uh entrench it
[34:49] in their in their own state constitution
[34:51] with an amendment to expand it to
[34:54] reinforce it so or give more rights in
[34:56] abortion and out of 10 races
[34:59] 71 three
[35:01] lost so they pushed it to the States but
[35:04] it didn't matter because the popular
[35:07] vote of the women moved it
[35:09] anyways it was all a political move it's
[35:12] coming anyways and then the churches who
[35:14] are supposed to be amen against abortion
[35:17] against all of this they they still side
[35:20] amen with this party even though they
[35:22] changed the platform they still side
[35:24] they still align they still pray for
[35:26] Trump they still pray to they still do
[35:28] all of that why because it's their only
[35:31] hope for any control whatsoever amen but
[35:33] they're already delving in the Realms of
[35:36] compromise because they've left the word
[35:39] and trying the woman's trying to take
[35:41] power by reasoning by senses amen by
[35:44] education by intellect she's trying to
[35:47] take power and dominion and control but
[35:49] she's left the word and has no more
[35:51] power by the word and now she's moved by
[35:53] moving into the politics you
[35:55] automatically move into the realm of
[35:56] compromise yeah because politics is
[35:59] built on
[36:01] compromising so that we can move an
[36:03] agenda and as soon as the church aligns
[36:05] with politics they move to
[36:08] compromise and they've all they've
[36:10] listen they've given up the fight on
[36:13] Banning
[36:14] abortion just go read some articles
[36:17] they've given it up what they're trying
[36:19] to do now is Ban late term
[36:22] abortion and they're losing
[36:26] that cuz it's a woman's
[36:29] world because it's a woman's
[36:31] world and so as I as I looked on that I
[36:34] mean many of us know those things we've
[36:36] looked at those things and and none of
[36:37] that's new we've been seeing that it's
[36:39] been going that way for for decades now
[36:43] but as I began to look at what was being
[36:45] said and even today uh when vice
[36:48] president Harris conceded she she talked
[36:50] about she's always going to fight for
[36:51] the Reproductive Rights of woman to make
[36:53] decisions for her own
[36:55] body and that's reasonable it's
[36:57] reasoning and blah blah blah but when it
[37:00] comes down to it it's absolutely
[37:02] Antichrist it's so far off the word it
[37:04] couldn't be any farther off of the wood
[37:06] because that's denying the very purpose
[37:09] for God bringing a woman onto this Earth
[37:11] she created women in the beginning so
[37:14] that Adam could reproduce himself on the
[37:17] earth and now what she's trying to do is
[37:20] take control of the very Purpose with
[37:23] which God made her and deny the very
[37:26] Purpose with which God made her and
[37:28] become a goddess herself to control this
[37:31] thing that God built her
[37:33] for
[37:35] amen it's it's horrible let's go to
[37:39] Matthew
[37:49] 19 now don't worry I'm not here to give
[37:51] a speech on
[37:53] abortion it's a
[37:55] sign it's just a physical sign showing
[37:58] there's a spirit behind it and that's
[38:01] what I want to look at is the spirit
[38:03] behind it Matthew
[38:09] 19:4 and this is now Jesus being
[38:11] questioned by the Pharisees on a marage
[38:13] and divorce he says have you not read
[38:15] verse four and he answered and said unto
[38:16] them have you not read that he which
[38:17] made them in the beginning made them
[38:19] male and female and said for this cause
[38:21] shall a man leave his father and mother
[38:23] shall cleave to his wife and they twain
[38:24] shall be one flesh wherefore they are no
[38:26] more Twain but one flesh what therefore
[38:29] God has joined together let no man put
[38:31] us
[38:31] under amen go and let before I go on
[38:35] let's go to Ephesians chapter 5
[38:37] now I want to catch that right here
[38:39] while I'm here Ephesians chapter
[38:51] 5 Ephesians 5 and verse
[38:56] 30 for for we are members of his body of
[38:59] his flesh and of his bones for this
[39:01] cause shall a man leave his father and
[39:03] mother and shall be joined into his wife
[39:05] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[39:07] a great mystery but I speak concerning
[39:10] Christ and the church that's why this
[39:13] issue is so important because this is
[39:15] just a manifestation of a great mystery
[39:17] and that mystery is Christ and his
[39:19] church and now when you see what the
[39:21] people are doing it's only manifesting
[39:23] what the churches are doing yeah man
[39:25] they're trying to take control of life
[39:27] amen and and they're trying to to to
[39:29] take it out of the man's hands and take
[39:32] it into their own hands yeah
[39:36] amen if I could
[39:39] uh yeah let me go here to First
[39:48] Timothy there some interesting
[39:51] things that brother brandham says here
[39:57] 1 Timothy Chapter
[40:06] 2 1 Timothy CH 2:
[40:09] 13 says for Adam was first formed then
[40:12] Eve and Adam was not deceived but the
[40:15] woman being deceived was in the
[40:16] transgression notwithstanding she shall
[40:18] be saved in childbearing if they
[40:19] continue in faith and charity and
[40:21] Holiness and sobriety I'm going to get
[40:24] to this scripture in just a minute but
[40:26] when when you start to hear hear the
[40:27] motto my body my choice amen there's
[40:30] such a Defiance in that there's a
[40:33] Defiance of male and and and then they
[40:35] make statements like no man is going to
[40:37] tell me what I can do with my body but
[40:39] then you deny the very reason God made a
[40:42] woman to begin with because she's to be
[40:44] a help meet to a man and she's to become
[40:46] one flesh with a man so that he can
[40:48] reproduce himself on the earth and she's
[40:50] saying no you can't use my body for that
[40:52] I'm in control amen but Jesus says that
[40:54] they're one amen Adam and Eve were one a
[40:57] man and his wife when they're joined
[40:58] together are one even a man that joins
[41:00] himself to a harlot becomes one flesh
[41:02] with
[41:03] her and she starts saying my body my
[41:06] body my body and not recognizing that
[41:08] that body was built and made to become
[41:10] part of a man to come into Union with a
[41:12] man under the headship of a man to
[41:14] reproduce that man upon the
[41:16] Earth not so you could take control amen
[41:20] if you want to take control that brings
[41:21] us right back to the Garden of Eden
[41:24] where you want to control how life's
[41:26] going to come forth
[41:28] yeah this is a huge issue friends and
[41:30] I'm not talking about the social issue
[41:32] I'm talking about the issue of the
[41:33] churches trying to take control over
[41:36] receiving the
[41:38] seed oh my goodness say God help us help
[41:42] us come to a full realization of what
[41:45] what we should be doing what our purpose
[41:47] is on the earth why Christ has a bride
[41:49] amen not so that we can say my body my
[41:53] choice not my body not my choice he
[41:55] purchased me with his blood it's it's
[41:57] not my choice it's not my decision it's
[41:59] his decision I don't control life life
[42:02] comes from him it's not up to me it's up
[42:04] to him I'm not taking the leadership the
[42:06] only thing I can do is surrender to his
[42:08] leadership and lay myself down under his
[42:11] authority and he's got life his word is
[42:15] life his seed is life and all the only
[42:17] thing I can do is surrender to that life
[42:19] and receive that life and bring forth
[42:22] that life but I cannot control that life
[42:26] I cannot control the male I cannot
[42:28] control the life
[42:30] right oh praise God you see what this
[42:33] this whole abortion and this whole birth
[42:35] control and this whole fertility rights
[42:37] has to do with has everything to do with
[42:39] putting the woman in control of when and
[42:41] where and how life will come forth and
[42:43] now it's not up to the man but brother
[42:45] Brenham said The Germ of life is in the
[42:47] man the man's carrying the life not the
[42:49] woman she can't bring forth life without
[42:51] the man because she's dependent on the
[42:53] man for life she's got to find a way to
[42:56] take control over the man's life stream
[42:59] yeah
[43:01] right my my my
[43:05] my God help us look at the day we live
[43:09] in friends look at how absolutely Wicked
[43:11] it is Satan's Eden has come to its peak
[43:14] the things that have begun the seeds
[43:15] that have been swn they're coming to
[43:17] full fruition and they're everywhere
[43:19] they're all around us and what was
[43:20] absolutely Dreadful just 60 70 years ago
[43:24] is becoming so common openly talked
[43:26] about accepted and celebrated and
[43:33] praised we look at this scripture now
[43:36] referring back to the Garden of Eden
[43:38] again in Timothy for Adam was first
[43:40] formed in Eve and Adam was not deceived
[43:42] but the woman being deceived was in the
[43:43] transgression notwithstanding she shall
[43:45] be saved in childbearing listen this is
[43:48] an odd scripture has anybody else read
[43:50] this and said this is I don't quite
[43:52] understand it clearly I I'm still there
[43:55] okay I'm not telling you I got the
[43:56] perfect definition of this I've read
[43:58] this for years amen and there's only a
[44:00] little bit that brother bandam says
[44:01] about it and we're going to look at one
[44:02] aspect of it but it's tied all the way
[44:05] back to the Garden of Eden it's tied to
[44:07] the original purpose of the woman it's
[44:09] tied to the fall it's tied to the
[44:12] deception right so Adam was not deceived
[44:14] but the woman being deceived was in the
[44:15] transgression notwithstanding she shall
[44:17] be saved in childbearing if they
[44:19] continue in faith and charity and
[44:20] Holiness with sobriety and you look at
[44:22] that and say okay so the only way for a
[44:25] woman to be saved is if she has a baby
[44:26] what if she never gets
[44:28] married what if she gets married and
[44:30] never has a
[44:32] baby so this can't be what the scripture
[44:34] is telling us that's the only way she
[44:35] can be saved but it's showing a picture
[44:38] it's telling us something that has to do
[44:40] with the woman being in the
[44:42] transgression and Adam not being
[44:44] deceived but she
[44:46] was in questions and answers brother BS
[44:49] asked this question about what this
[44:50] means he says not by having a baby makes
[44:53] her saved but because that she is
[44:56] raising raing children doing her
[45:01] Duty raising children doing her Duty not
[45:04] raising cats dogs and what more to take
[45:06] the place of a child as they do today
[45:08] giving it a mother's love so that she
[45:10] can go out and run around all night some
[45:12] people do that sorry but they do it
[45:14] that's awful rude for me to say it but
[45:15] the truth is the truth they don't want a
[45:17] baby to be tied down with but in
[45:20] childbearing if she continues in faith
[45:23] Holiness and all sobriety she'll be
[45:25] saved but the if is you shall be saved
[45:27] too if you're born again if you you can
[45:30] be healed if you believe you can receive
[45:32] the Holy Ghost if you believe it get
[45:33] ready for it if you're ready for him and
[45:35] she shall be saved if she keeps doing
[45:37] these other things so brother random he
[45:40] says but not because she's a woman so
[45:42] brother Bram was not saying and brother
[45:44] B in another place he said that's a
[45:45] Catholic doctrine that the woman has to
[45:48] if she marri she has to bring forth
[45:50] children she's saved and child bearing
[45:51] he said that's a Catholic Doctrine he
[45:52] said he didn't believe in that but what
[45:54] he's showing is the woman was made for
[45:56] an original purpose and when she submits
[45:58] to that purpose when given the
[46:00] opportunity amen God blesses it and God
[46:03] loves it and this is part of the
[46:05] Redemption of the woman because she's
[46:07] the one who chose sex in the beginning
[46:09] because she chose sex by sex desire
[46:12] that's now how everybody's going to be
[46:13] born on this Earth and now in order for
[46:16] her to redeem herself she must play her
[46:20] part that doesn't mean if you're not
[46:23] married or if you can't have a child
[46:25] that you're not included no what what
[46:27] it's saying is if you've got the
[46:28] opportunity but you refuse you don't
[46:30] want to give your body you don't want to
[46:32] give your time you don't want to give
[46:33] yourself to your husband you don't want
[46:35] to give up your career you don't want to
[46:37] give up your social life you don't want
[46:38] to give up but you want to preserve my
[46:40] body my decision that's absolutely evil
[46:44] amen because the woman was made to bring
[46:47] life on this
[46:49] earth when she denies that she denies
[46:53] the very purpose for which she's made
[46:57] that's what's going on friends she's
[46:59] trying to change her purpose oh yeah she
[47:02] wants to take the man's place she wants
[47:04] to be the leader she wants to be the
[47:05] boss she wants to be have the education
[47:07] she wants to make the decisions and she
[47:09] knows if she Ms submits herself to this
[47:11] realm to the headship of a man to bring
[47:14] forth children she will hinder herself
[47:16] in competition with the man yeah
[47:20] right so she is denying her purpose yes
[47:25] and choosing her own purpose
[47:27] her god-given purpose and choosing her
[47:29] own
[47:31] purpose the church is doing the same
[47:35] thing same exact
[47:38] thing in the invisible Union of the
[47:41] bride of Christ brother re says the
[47:44] complete total insanity this world will
[47:48] go into right away it's almost here now
[47:51] while you see the footsteps of it there
[47:53] it's marching right out on the street
[47:55] right down the church pew total in
[47:56] sanity do things that a human being
[47:59] wouldn't think of doing and being
[48:01] civilized look what Hollywood has done
[48:03] to the woman look how it's it's robbed
[48:05] the sacred virtues of woman on and on we
[48:08] could go see all this she lost how did
[48:11] she do it because there was a subtle
[48:13] instrument called The Church like there
[48:15] was in the Garden of Eden a subtle
[48:16] person the devil walked into the church
[48:19] just like he did in the Garden of Eden
[48:21] and deceived her into it she is deceived
[48:24] the woman thinks she don't mean mean to
[48:27] be wrong Eve didn't mean to do wrong it
[48:29] wasn't willfully the Bible said in
[48:31] second Timothy 1 Timothy 3 she was
[48:33] deceived and deceived is not when you
[48:34] willfully do it it's when you're
[48:36] deceived into doing it and that's just
[48:38] exactly what happened today she's been
[48:40] deceived by television by magazine by
[48:43] these people this all these fine things
[48:45] that they're going out on the street
[48:46] modern girls they look at magazines they
[48:49] look at pictures they look on the street
[48:51] they see the clothing in the shops how
[48:53] Satan that great instrument of hell has
[48:55] come down amongst the people and and
[48:56] deceive them into these things and the
[48:58] woman thinks she's all right and she is
[49:01] dead and don't know it she is as far
[49:03] from God see how she lost all this and
[49:06] how subtle it was today I want you to
[49:09] notice Jesus spoke of it also you'd like
[49:12] to read it Jesus made mention that this
[49:13] thing would come to pass did you know
[49:15] that in the last hours just before his
[49:17] crucifix just let's just read it uh in
[49:20] Luke the 23rd chapter beginning the 27th
[49:24] verse I believe I got it marked out here
[49:26] uh let's listen St Luke 23:27 I believe
[49:29] it is he says and there followed him a
[49:32] great company of people and women which
[49:34] also bewailed and lamented him but Jesus
[49:37] turning unto them said Daughters of
[49:38] Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for
[49:41] yourselves and for your children for
[49:43] behold the days are coming and they that
[49:45] they shall say blessed are the barren
[49:48] and the wound that never bear and the PS
[49:50] which never gave
[49:51] suck brother brandham is he's attaching
[49:55] it right to the woman losing her sacred
[49:57] virtues because of Hollywood and modern
[50:01] culture think today a disgrace for her
[50:05] to have a
[50:06] child then shall they begin to say to
[50:08] the mountains fall on us and Hills cover
[50:12] us for if they do these things in a
[50:14] green tree what shall they do in a dry
[50:16] speaking of the day that when women
[50:18] wouldn't no more want children they want
[50:21] a dog or a cat or something like that
[50:23] but she don't want children anymore why
[50:25] she's old mother hubard if she has a
[50:27] child she don't want that's the remarks
[50:29] of Hollywood it don't want this woman to
[50:32] be an old mother hubber so she'll he'll
[50:34] have some operation performed to himself
[50:37] or her one that'll keep them from having
[50:39] children they don't want no children
[50:41] Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at
[50:44] that time they'll begin to cry for the
[50:45] rocks and the mountains to fall on us
[50:48] she'll practice birth control so she can
[50:50] go to parties she can't be bothered with
[50:52] baby a baby nursing her it'll disform
[50:54] her when she's pregnated it'll be it'll
[50:56] this former she won't look like she used
[50:58] to and her husband ignorant enough to
[51:00] let her go that way she won't give him a
[51:02] Child Jesus spoke of it and he said when
[51:04] they're doing this at that time they'll
[51:06] go to cry for crying then for the rocks
[51:09] to fall on them it's the coming of the
[51:13] Lord are we
[51:15] here have we
[51:17] arrived is it the talking point in the
[51:20] news is it the issue is it the debatable
[51:23] issue of the day is it the thing that's
[51:25] being promoted and protected and
[51:27] glorified listen it it it's it's right
[51:30] in front of us and has everything to do
[51:32] with life and has everything to do with
[51:34] the way life comes has everything to do
[51:36] with who's going to control the coming
[51:38] forth of
[51:42] life and the woman wants
[51:45] control because the church wants
[51:49] control but we don't want
[51:52] control there's a true bride who wants
[51:54] to be submissive to her headship and she
[51:55] doesn't want tool control anything all
[51:57] she wants to do is say Lord I'm here I'm
[52:00] Yours anytime you want to use me use me
[52:02] my body is yours my mind is yours my
[52:04] mouth is yours I'm all yours I have no
[52:06] agenda of my own no motive of my own I
[52:09] don't need Amen to accomplish
[52:13] anything
[52:15] amen listen to what brother B says in
[52:17] power of
[52:20] transformation he says now he had 6,000
[52:22] years to do it with his poison spray and
[52:25] how did he do it now this is a striking
[52:27] part and listen close he did it by
[52:29] Civilization now that sounds strange but
[52:31] that's what I'm going to make a
[52:32] statement here that will keep you
[52:34] guessing maybe for a few minutes I hope
[52:36] not but did you realize this now I'm not
[52:38] trying to support ignorance but did you
[52:40] know that Civilization Science Education
[52:43] and the things that we cherish so great
[52:45] today is the very instrument of Satan
[52:48] even civilization civilization never
[52:50] come by God civilization come by Satan
[52:53] now I'll prove that to you by the word
[52:55] just in a few minutes civilization is
[52:57] not of God for let me show you in this
[53:00] civilization the more civilized we get
[53:02] as we work through science we are always
[53:04] killing
[53:06] ourselves see and this civilization has
[53:08] built up to this Pinnacle now and we got
[53:10] death in this civilization we got sin in
[53:12] the civilization we got sickness in the
[53:15] civilization that can't be of
[53:19] God man you realize that Civilization is
[53:22] that's what we're living in Satan's even
[53:25] come to the Pinnacle civilization and
[53:27] Science and education do you know that
[53:30] that that the ones who are promoting
[53:32] this agenda this abortion agenda are the
[53:35] educated women right not the
[53:37] non-educated women they start doing
[53:40] polls the ones who are pushing for it
[53:42] the ones are are taking advantage of it
[53:43] the ones who want uh fertility rights
[53:45] and all of that are the educated women
[53:48] amen some of the humble women are still
[53:50] happy to get married and still happy to
[53:52] have a baby and still happy to take care
[53:54] of their children
[53:57] by Science Education civilization man is
[54:01] killing himself he's become an absolute
[54:04] Barbarian amen by trying to educate and
[54:07] civilize and become better and greater
[54:09] and greater and control everything till
[54:10] he's got to a place where there where
[54:13] where men and women I I mean
[54:14] heathenistic aboriginies and the pygmy
[54:17] Indians in the middle of Africa who
[54:18] can't read or write won't kill their
[54:20] children they will have babies and call
[54:23] it a
[54:24] blessing the most ignorant the most
[54:26] uneducated have the most basic
[54:28] fundamental of humanity in mind this is
[54:31] the survival of the human race and we so
[54:34] become so educated and so civilized and
[54:37] have so much scientific understanding
[54:39] that we absolutely will
[54:41] destroy the furthering of the human race
[54:44] by what
[54:47] civilization it looks like such a great
[54:49] thing we we got schools and we got
[54:51] education and we got listen it's the
[54:53] college campuses that is pumping this
[54:54] out it's the college campus that are
[54:56] teaching the women these things and it's
[54:58] passing all the way down through Hey
[55:00] listen this is not godliness this is
[55:03] Antichrist this is off the word this is
[55:05] Satan's Eden and it's a way for man in
[55:07] his intellect and his wisdom and his
[55:09] abilities to kill himself by destroying
[55:12] his offspring you don't have absolutely
[55:14] nobody to take care of him at the end of
[55:16] life you have a woman woman that gets
[55:18] trapped into this doesn't want to get
[55:20] married or she gets married wants to
[55:21] maintain her career wants to be a lawyer
[55:23] wants to be a CPA wants to do all these
[55:25] things wants to achieve high ranking
[55:27] positions finally she gets so so so of
[55:29] age she tries to have a baby she can't
[55:31] have a baby she lives the rest of her
[55:33] life without it her and her husband get
[55:34] old and then what do they do they made
[55:36] money they stockpiled money they put it
[55:38] away they have retirement they have
[55:40] 401ks they have all of that so that they
[55:42] could pay a nursing home because they
[55:43] have nobody to take care of them when
[55:45] they get older what have they done
[55:47] civilization education science they
[55:50] destroy
[55:54] themselves absolutely
[55:58] foolishness for
[56:01] what I will
[56:05] decide my body my
[56:09] choice evil
[56:14] statement let's go to Romans chapter 1
[56:26] Romans chapter
[56:30] 1 go to verse
[56:40] 22 professing themselves to be wise they
[56:43] became
[56:45] fools that's this modern
[56:48] civilization it's all these agendas
[56:50] that's all of that's what's
[56:52] pushing empowering the woman is death
[56:57] bringing her into rulership is
[57:01] death allowing her to take the lead
[57:03] brought death when she went first when
[57:05] she took the lead when she used the
[57:08] reasoning and Science and education to
[57:10] make the
[57:11] decision on how this word will be
[57:13] fulfilled she brought death to the human
[57:19] race listen this is why brother brandham
[57:21] is hammering and hammering and hammering
[57:24] and hammering and hammering he said when
[57:26] a woman gets out of the kitchen she gets
[57:28] out of her place he says statements like
[57:32] uh a woman doesn't know which side of
[57:33] the house she belongs on listen we're
[57:36] we're in I mean we're in the Pinnacle of
[57:38] Leo deia right now in women's rights you
[57:40] go around work and start spewing that
[57:41] stuff out and see how well that
[57:44] goes but he was trying to point out what
[57:47] was going on in the society where he was
[57:50] seeing drastic changes in the conduct of
[57:52] women and the way families are
[57:54] structured and the way homes operate and
[57:56] the way women operate dress themselves
[57:58] conduct themselves and take care of
[57:59] their families and brother bandam says
[58:01] when you break motherhood you break the
[58:03] backbone of a
[58:04] country he saw the collapse of
[58:07] civilization and the collapse of
[58:08] motherhood when the woman was given a
[58:10] position that she should never have so
[58:13] he starts hammering the way she dresses
[58:15] he starts hammering I'm not into this
[58:17] modernistic idea of women working a
[58:19] woman should be at home a keeper he
[58:21] starts hammering all of these stuff
[58:23] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[58:24] show us the world's going in the the
[58:26] wrong direction this is not God's
[58:28] way this is this is
[58:31] Eden but we're supposed to be coming
[58:34] back and reversing
[58:37] eaten 1 Corinthians 3 let's turn there
[58:45] quickly 1 Corinthians chapter
[58:54] 3 1 Corinthians 3:18 let no man deceive
[58:57] himself if any man among you seeth to be
[59:00] wise in this world let him become a fool
[59:03] that he may be wise for the wisdom of
[59:05] this world is foolishness with God for
[59:07] it is written he taketh the wise in
[59:09] their own craftiness and again the Lord
[59:11] knoweth the thoughts of the wise that
[59:14] they are
[59:17] vain listen brother bam said the old
[59:21] mammies in Kentucky know better yeah
[59:24] than the modern women yeah
[59:26] I'm telling you the the ignorant of the
[59:28] ignorant somewhere out in the jungle
[59:30] somewhere know better than this
[59:31] modernistic American woman and man too
[59:35] oh
[59:36] yeah so we see that the whole thing has
[59:40] gone the wrong
[59:42] way because a woman wants to say I
[59:46] control when life comes forth and I
[59:50] decide if you'll use my body for life to
[59:55] come or not
[1:00:02] you see mankind shaking his fist in the
[1:00:06] face of
[1:00:08] God
[1:00:09] right and it has to do with same-sex
[1:00:13] marriage gender confusion G self- gender
[1:00:17] selection and all these other it's all
[1:00:19] the same thing it's everybody looking at
[1:00:21] God and saying I can do whatever I want
[1:00:26] but God's put you on free moral Agy do
[1:00:28] whatever you want that's fine but you're
[1:00:30] destroying Yourself by what civilization
[1:00:32] science and
[1:00:35] education oh let me be an ignorant Bible
[1:00:38] believer let me be somebody doesn't know
[1:00:40] the ways of the world and maybe I don't
[1:00:42] so much know how to fit into society and
[1:00:44] I can't quite cope with the way things
[1:00:46] are but let me cope with this Amen Let
[1:00:48] Me Be ignorant to The Wilds of the world
[1:00:50] maybe a little poorly educated maybe not
[1:00:52] well spoken and maybe not able to keep
[1:00:54] up with things but if I can just stick
[1:00:56] with this word and surrender it
[1:00:58] everything will be fine let my wisdom
[1:01:00] become foolishness that I can become
[1:01:02] wise in God cuz his wisdom is greater
[1:01:05] than the wisdom of the world his
[1:01:07] foolishness is greater than the wisdom
[1:01:09] of the
[1:01:10] world Amen in the pergan church age I'm
[1:01:13] going just the next step now in this
[1:01:15] pick up your pin and WR section so he
[1:01:18] told us first that Adam was given a
[1:01:21] bride to reproduce himself on the Earth
[1:01:23] but then he says the second son Jesus
[1:01:26] also a spoken seed word of God was given
[1:01:28] a bride like as was Adam but before he
[1:01:31] could marry her she also had fallen she
[1:01:34] like Adam's wife was put to the test
[1:01:35] whether she would believe the word of
[1:01:37] God and live or doubt the word and die
[1:01:39] she doubted she left the word she died
[1:01:43] from a little group of the true seed of
[1:01:45] the word God will present Christ with
[1:01:46] the Beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[1:01:49] word she is a virgin because she knows
[1:01:51] no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and
[1:01:53] through the members of the Bride will be
[1:01:55] fulfilled all that was promised of God
[1:01:58] to be made manifest in the Virgin The
[1:02:01] Word of Promise came to the Virgin Mary
[1:02:04] but that Word of Promise was he himself
[1:02:07] to be made manifest it wasn't a
[1:02:09] scripture it was a
[1:02:13] person The Word of Promise was he
[1:02:16] himself to be made manifest where was he
[1:02:19] going to be made manifest in her through
[1:02:23] her but that Word of Promise was he
[1:02:25] himself to be made manifest God was made
[1:02:27] manifest he himself acted at that time
[1:02:30] and fulfilled his own Word of Promise in
[1:02:32] the Virgin it was an angel that had
[1:02:34] brought her the message but the Angel's
[1:02:37] message was the word of God Isaiah 9:6
[1:02:40] he fulfilled at that time all that was
[1:02:42] written of him because she accepted his
[1:02:44] word to her what did she have to do just
[1:02:48] accept just receive the word which is
[1:02:50] the
[1:02:51] seed and the seed has its own life and
[1:02:55] it'll produce its own life amen you
[1:02:57] remember when we we were been speaking
[1:03:00] of Abraham and Sarah so many times and
[1:03:02] and Abraham remember brother B said
[1:03:05] because Abraham and Sarah were married
[1:03:07] that Sarah was part of Abraham and when
[1:03:09] God came in flesh to the tent and began
[1:03:11] to discern amen the thoughts in Sarah's
[1:03:13] heart and the T behind him amen she
[1:03:15] denied what he had said lied to his face
[1:03:18] and God said brother said God would have
[1:03:19] struck her dead then but he couldn't
[1:03:21] hurt her without hurting Abraham she was
[1:03:23] part of
[1:03:24] Abraham amen that means Sarah couldn't
[1:03:26] say my body my choice no it was
[1:03:29] Abraham's body that's why Eve the woman
[1:03:32] in the Garden of Eden she couldn't say
[1:03:34] my body my choice no no no no no amen
[1:03:37] that was Adam's
[1:03:40] Body because he called their name Adam
[1:03:43] he put them together they were one flesh
[1:03:44] in the guys Eyes Of God they were one
[1:03:46] and when you're joined to your wife
[1:03:48] you're one there's no more my body my
[1:03:50] choice no
[1:03:52] amen that's not what God wanted he
[1:03:54] wanted the two to become one that's
[1:03:57] God's purpose that was God's intention
[1:03:59] in the beginning the two to become
[1:04:01] one and so now God could not fulfill the
[1:04:06] promise through any other vessel but
[1:04:09] then part of Abraham because the promise
[1:04:11] was to Abraham that out of his loin
[1:04:13] shall come a son that shall inherit amen
[1:04:16] so there could be no nothing else but
[1:04:19] part of Abraham to produce the promise
[1:04:21] to
[1:04:22] Abraham that's why when they tried to
[1:04:24] take Hagar and produce through Hagar
[1:04:26] would never work Hagar wasn't part of
[1:04:28] Abraham amen Sarah was part of Abraham
[1:04:31] and when the promise was to Abraham it
[1:04:33] was to Sarah also she was included amen
[1:04:37] what Abraham needed Abraham needed a
[1:04:42] womb and Abraham had
[1:04:44] one and his wife because they were one
[1:04:49] flesh can you imagine her trying to
[1:04:52] deny him the right to bring forth a
[1:04:54] promised seed
[1:04:59] and works as Faith expressed brother B
[1:05:01] starts picking up this about Mary the
[1:05:03] Virgin Mary he says now notice
[1:05:06] Mary
[1:05:08] now says now Lord wait a minute I never
[1:05:12] knowed a man this is impossible nothing
[1:05:15] like this never happened oh oh no
[1:05:16] nothing like this ever happened how am I
[1:05:19] going to have this baby I don't know any
[1:05:20] man so it can't happen uh angel you're
[1:05:24] just mistaken I've got an iCal illusion
[1:05:26] you know my church says these days are
[1:05:28] gone nah it would never have fell in
[1:05:30] such a place like that Mary never
[1:05:34] questioned he says she said how can it
[1:05:36] be I know no man he said the Holy Ghost
[1:05:38] shall overshadow thee that's how it's
[1:05:40] going to happen she said behold the
[1:05:42] hands made of the Lord no
[1:05:45] question no question see Isaiah when God
[1:05:48] produced the word by thought Revelation
[1:05:50] Into the Heart of Isaiah it fell into
[1:05:52] the right grounds it was a prophet the
[1:05:55] prophet didn't care for any man's Wisdom
[1:05:57] he didn't care for any man's
[1:05:58] intellectual he didn't care about the
[1:06:00] person of anybody he was a dedicated
[1:06:03] channel to God and God spoke and God
[1:06:06] spoke and he spoke that's all whether it
[1:06:08] hurt whether it didn't whether it
[1:06:10] sounded crazy whether it didn't sound
[1:06:11] crazy didn't make any difference to him
[1:06:14] it was God not the man and when the word
[1:06:17] went forth now it becomes a seed it has
[1:06:21] to fall somewhere if God said it there's
[1:06:24] bound to be a womb somewhere for it to
[1:06:26] fall into so Isaiah said a virgin shall
[1:06:29] conceive that was God he didn't worry
[1:06:31] about the science the education he
[1:06:33] didn't worry about the civilization he
[1:06:34] didn't worry about whether it made sense
[1:06:35] or didn't make sense he just said what
[1:06:37] God Said a virgin shall conceive that
[1:06:40] that word was a seed that seed moved out
[1:06:42] it had to find a good ground to get
[1:06:44] planted in it had to find a womb
[1:06:46] somewhere and that somewhere was the
[1:06:49] Virgin Mary amen and when the angel of
[1:06:51] the Lord came to the Virgin Mary when
[1:06:53] Gabriel came to the Virgin Mary and said
[1:06:55] listen now it's you you're the one
[1:06:57] that's going to happen to you she said
[1:06:59] how's that possible I don't know a man
[1:07:00] he said the Holy Ghost should overshadow
[1:07:02] you she said be it unto me according to
[1:07:04] your word not let me think about it not

[1:07:21] plans it it
[1:07:25] yeah she didn't care about her plans she
[1:07:27] didn't care about her physique she
[1:07:29] didn't care about anything the word had
[1:07:31] come to her and there was something in
[1:07:32] her that says I'll receive that seed you
[1:07:35] can have my body you can have my womb
[1:07:38] you can have my whole
[1:07:39] life if it brings me rejection if it
[1:07:42] brings me if it if it ruins my future
[1:07:45] marriage to Joseph whatever happens
[1:07:47] happens it doesn't matter cuz I'm not
[1:07:49] here to dictate how life will come I'm
[1:07:51] not here to control life I'm not here to
[1:07:53] control the word control the SE control
[1:07:56] life I'm only here to receive the
[1:07:58] seed to give it a place to come forth on
[1:08:01] this Earth amen we are the garden that
[1:08:04] God wants to plant his seed in he's the
[1:08:06] gardener he has the seed he wants to
[1:08:08] plant his seed in the in in in his
[1:08:10] garden amen and it's not up to the
[1:08:12] Garden it's up to the
[1:08:14] gardener it's up to the male not to the
[1:08:17] female and the garden can't say you
[1:08:19] can't plant that seed now I'm not
[1:08:22] ready when he was ready he came to Mary

[1:08:32] to I want to see if I can become CEO I
[1:08:35] want
[1:08:39] to Mary's our
[1:08:42] example not this modern Church who's got
[1:08:44] agendas and wants to accomplish things
[1:08:46] and they don't want to surrender to the
[1:08:48] word of God because it would take over
[1:08:49] their bodies it would change their walk
[1:08:51] they couldn't keep doing what they want
[1:08:52] they can't go on with their own agendas
[1:08:54] and their own program and their own
[1:08:56] ideas and their own scientific
[1:08:57] achievement and their own
[1:08:58] accomplishments they're going to have to
[1:09:00] be bear reproach they're going to have
[1:09:01] to be rejected they're going to have to
[1:09:03] give up their life in order what in
[1:09:05] order to receive this seed that comes
[1:09:06] from
[1:09:08] Christ that's why the
[1:09:10] churches the churches are trying to
[1:09:13] control the
[1:09:14] life they're trying to decide listen can
[1:09:18] you imagine the garden telling the
[1:09:21] gardener you can plant listen you can
[1:09:24] plant figs but you can't plant out
[1:09:28] you can plant daffodils but don't do
[1:09:32] lies that's what the church is doing
[1:09:34] yeah right I'll take that commandment
[1:09:37] but I'm not going to take that one I'll
[1:09:40] take this word but I don't think that
[1:09:41] counts for today anymore and the church
[1:09:43] is trying to
[1:09:45] control
[1:09:51] life and Satan zeden brother B

[1:09:57] word his seeds his seeds brought an Eden
[1:10:00] of Holiness love and eternal life God
[1:10:05] had swed seeds and he knew the power
[1:10:06] that was in the seed and that seed in
[1:10:08] the right condition had brought forth a
[1:10:10] perfect Eden and it had brought forth an
[1:10:12] Eden of Holiness love and eternal life
[1:10:14] that's what God's Eden produced Holiness
[1:10:16] and it brought an Eden of Holiness of
[1:10:18] love understanding Perfection eternal
[1:10:20] life that's what God is planting his
[1:10:23] word his seed
[1:10:26] that's what his church will be at the
[1:10:27] end it'll be the same
[1:10:30] thing what will this church be at the
[1:10:32] end she'll be the Garden of Eden and
[1:10:35] what's he going to plant in her he's
[1:10:36] going to plant all his seeds of his word
[1:10:39] in her and he's going to have a garden
[1:10:41] of Holiness and love and understanding
[1:10:44] and Perfection once again where's it

[1:14:25] you imagine the garden of the modern
[1:14:32] Church casting out
[1:14:36] seeds it's what they're
[1:14:38] doing right casting out seeds the seed
[1:14:42] that brings life the seed that contains
[1:14:45] life the very word of God with life in
[1:14:47] it they're casting it
[1:14:49] out they're throwing it out they're
[1:14:51] refusing it they're rejecting it they
[1:14:54] want they they they want the benefits of
[1:14:56] being married but they don't
[1:14:58] want to give
[1:15:02] all this modern society we live in and
[1:15:05] the issues that we're facing is only
[1:15:07] showing where the church is
[1:15:11] at they want to control the seed they
[1:15:13] want to control the life they want to
[1:15:15] decide they want to decide what they do
[1:15:18] and what they don't do what they listen
[1:15:19] to what they don't listen
[1:15:21] to what seed gets planted and what seed
[1:15:24] doesn't get planted
[1:15:26] and which ones get plucked up and Cast
[1:15:31] Away it's what these issues in society
[1:15:34] are all
[1:15:35] about there's a spirit behind
[1:15:38] it but oh I thank God that he's going to
[1:15:42] have good ground he's promised it he's
[1:15:46] predestinated it he's going to have a
[1:15:48] place where he can sew his seed and
[1:15:49] there's going to be somebody like Mary
[1:15:51] says be it unto me according to your
[1:15:53] word I'll give my body for that I'll
[1:15:56] give my mind for that I'll give my
[1:15:58] tongue for that I'll give my eyes I'll
[1:15:59] give everything for
[1:16:03] that I don't want to have an
[1:16:06] agenda I don't want to have my own will
[1:16:10] I don't want to have to get my own
[1:16:11] accomplishments in life I don't want to
[1:16:13] be that kind of woman I want to be the
[1:16:16] kind and listen we can't control
[1:16:20] life the woman can't control life life
[1:16:22] is in the mail this is what brother bam
[1:16:24] said says life comes from the male life
[1:16:26] comes from Christ life comes from this
[1:16:29] word life comes with from Christ and I
[1:16:32] can't control him amen all I can do is
[1:16:35] receive him when he comes to me the
[1:16:38] woman can't control life she can't
[1:16:40] produce it she can't force it she can't
[1:16:42] make it happen it has to be the will of
[1:16:44] the
[1:16:45] man but now in this Modern Age the
[1:16:47] woman's trying to Desert her own will
[1:16:49] and her will over the will of the man
[1:16:51] and her control over the life that the
[1:16:53] man carries
[1:16:56] but not this bride this bride doesn't
[1:16:58] want any control we can't control the
[1:17:00] life I don't want to control the life he
[1:17:02] alone has the life all I want to do is
[1:17:04] when that life comes to me and when he
[1:17:06] comes knocking on my door I want to say
[1:17:08] Here I Am Lord you can have me I
[1:17:11] surrender all to you you can have you
[1:17:13] can sew your life into me and now I
[1:17:16] can't control the life I can't dictate
[1:17:18] when it will come I can't I can't
[1:17:20] control it neither will I cast it out
[1:17:22] the only thing I can do is nurture it
[1:17:24] and give my whole life for it what did
[1:17:26] Mary do Mary gave her life amen she
[1:17:29] couldn't control the time she couldn't
[1:17:30] control when he would come she had no
[1:17:31] seed amen but he came to her in due
[1:17:34] season at the appointed time and she
[1:17:36] said be it unto me according to your
[1:17:38] word she received that life and then
[1:17:40] that life took over her life and all she
[1:17:42] could do was serve the life on the
[1:17:44] inside when she had hunger pain she fed
[1:17:46] it she was feeding that life on the
[1:17:48] inside of her I hope you receive life
[1:17:50] and have some hunger pains for this
[1:17:52] message and feed that life on the inside
[1:17:55] then that life come forth and she
[1:17:57] carried it she nursed it she swaddled it
[1:18:00] she bathed it she fed it she helped it
[1:18:02] walk what did she do she was there she
[1:18:04] can't control life she can't dictate
[1:18:06] life she's not there to do that she's
[1:18:08] only there to receive life and nurture
[1:18:11] life what is the bride here to do
[1:18:13] receive life and nurture life love it
[1:18:18] care for it give her all for
[1:18:23] it brother B says and message marriage
[1:18:25] and
[1:18:26] divorce and so it is with the church
[1:18:28] that refuses to become pregnant in the
[1:18:30] age that we now live in to bring forth
[1:18:33] children of this age we are not
[1:18:34] lutherans we are not Wesley neither are
[1:18:36] we Pentecostals we got to be the
[1:18:38] children of this age through the
[1:18:39] pregnancy of the word of God to bring
[1:18:42] forth a child of this age the seed
[1:18:44] child anden I hope you understand could
[1:18:48] be couldn't be pregnated no so what did
[1:18:51] he do he put her away in divorcement
[1:18:52] that's right but she dared put him away
[1:18:55] he put her away he went he went right on
[1:18:58] revealing his word to the body and
[1:18:59] vindicating himself by himself his
[1:19:02] children begin to kind of look more like
[1:19:04] him because it's fully maturing are
[1:19:06] they're becoming Children of the word
[1:19:07] not children of the church Children of
[1:19:09] the word and the bride will be a lovely
[1:19:13] little lady of the word unadulterated
[1:19:16] not touched by any man's organization
[1:19:18] any manmade Theory she'll be purely
[1:19:20] unadulterated Bride of the word amen
[1:19:23] amen I hope you get that out on the air
[1:19:26] she will be the pregnated daughter of
[1:19:29] God see what a great honor a woman can
[1:19:32] be see what a great thing the church can
[1:19:36] be what was a woman made for to be a
[1:19:39] help meet to the man to reproduce him on
[1:19:43] the earth what is the bride been created
[1:19:46] for to be a helpmate for my Lord so that
[1:19:49] he can reproduce
[1:19:51] himself on this
[1:19:53] Earth it's a partnership but I can't
[1:19:56] control
[1:19:57] it I can't control it I have no desire
[1:20:00] to control it it's a partnership but all
[1:20:03] I can do is surrender to
[1:20:07] it Paul tells the church he said I'm
[1:20:10] jealous over you with Godly
[1:20:13] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[1:20:15] husband that I may present you a Chase
[1:20:17] virgin to Christ he was guarding that
[1:20:19] little first church and he wanted her to
[1:20:21] stay virgin and he was jealous over her
[1:20:24] and wanted he was presenting her to
[1:20:26] Christ as a chased virgin but we know
[1:20:28] that church fell fell but God restored
[1:20:30] the brid tree in this day
[1:20:32] amen he's presented to Christ again
[1:20:35] through another Prophet another
[1:20:37] messenger he's restored to the church to
[1:20:40] the Christ again another virgin bride
[1:20:42] amen but then he goes on in Galatians to
[1:20:45] say my little children of whom I travail
[1:20:47] in birth again until Christ be formed in
[1:20:51] you Paul wanted to do more than just
[1:20:54] present her a virgin he also wanted
[1:20:56] Christ to be formed in her he wanted her
[1:20:58] to become the pregnated daughter of
[1:21:00] God we know that church first church
[1:21:03] fell but this church won't fall she's
[1:21:06] predestinated
[1:21:08] not and when the churches are dictating
[1:21:11] to Christ what they'll do and what they
[1:21:13] won't do what they'll receive and what
[1:21:15] they won't receive and when and where
[1:21:17] and how there's got to be a church
[1:21:20] somewhere that'll just say Lord I'm
[1:21:23] Yours
[1:21:24] I surrender
[1:21:26] all I don't have an ambition I don't
[1:21:28] have a desire I don't have a
[1:21:31] program I don't want to control your
[1:21:33] life I just want to receive your life I
[1:21:36] just want to nurture your
[1:21:38] life until eventually brother bam comes
[1:21:41] and says this is the mystery it's
[1:21:44] revealed in this day Christ in
[1:21:48] you the hope of
[1:21:51] glory this is the age of pregnation
[1:21:54] to be the pregnated daughter of God no
[1:21:57] wonder society's going crazy with
[1:22:01] fertility rights for women because this
[1:22:04] is the age of the impregnation of the
[1:22:06] Bride
[1:22:07] amen I'm so glad that God called
[1:22:12] me I'm so glad there was an angel
[1:22:15] messenger came to Mary I'm so glad an
[1:22:17] angel messenger came to
[1:22:19] me I'm so glad that that I can find
[1:22:22] myself in the scripture I'm just like
[1:22:23] where Mary was Mary was just a common
[1:22:25] person doing common things in a common
[1:22:27] way and nothing special but there was a
[1:22:29] messenger from Heaven came to her an
[1:22:31] angel came to her and said hey it's time
[1:22:33] for this scripture to be fulfilled and
[1:22:35] you're the one God wants to use does
[1:22:38] that sound familiar I heard an angel in
[1:22:40] this day come to me and say this is time
[1:22:43] for certain things to be fulfilled he
[1:22:44] wants to bring forth his life on this
[1:22:46] earth now it's time for the marriage
[1:22:48] it's time to reproduce the son of man
[1:22:50] again he wants to reproduce himself on
[1:22:52] the earth and he needs a bride
[1:22:57] and I'm so glad God put something in my
[1:22:59] heart not to say well maybe later and
[1:23:02] another season in life I got some other
[1:23:04] things I want to accomplish I want to
[1:23:05] get my degree I want to
[1:23:09] start I just want to say God be it unto
[1:23:13] me according to your word amen I want to
[1:23:16] be that virgin bride who surrenders all
[1:23:19] to be the place where you can plant your
[1:23:21] seed and it can come forth and reproduce
[1:23:24] you
[1:23:25] on the
[1:23:26] earth then let's all Stand
[1:23:29] Together musicians if you'll come
[1:23:37] please the world's all moving one way
[1:23:40] it's moving the wrong
[1:23:42] way but Christ has a bride that's moving
[1:23:45] the right

[1:24:58] of your word to to rub away all that
[1:25:01] Civilization has done in all science and
