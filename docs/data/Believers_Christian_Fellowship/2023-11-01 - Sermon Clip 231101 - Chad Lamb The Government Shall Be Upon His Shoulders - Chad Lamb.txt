========================================

and we know God we saw the son of man Ministry we saw a son of man revealing the son of man that was Jesus Christ the son of man had returned and was working through a son of man that Prophet amen but that son of man didn't leave the Earth when the prophet left the Earth because that that a son of man was there to unite The Head and the body together in the wedding Amen to do what to reproduce the son of man again so now that dispensation is in Bride for in between Son of God and Son of David in between priest and judge or and King amen and the time of Judge and you say then then all of a sudden we have to think oh my goodness you think now if that's the case if there's a unification here if the white wigged one has descended and come down the Supreme judge of all Heaven and Earth looking down with eyes of judgment and he's come to unite with the body and now the sash is about the girdles about the breast and sash over the shoulders we see this dispensational change we say if we're in judgment is there no more Mercy on that's always the question but I'll tell you this there's only one person that can ever extend mercy and the only person in all of our governments that can extend Mercy is the judge the only place to get Mercy is at the Judgment seat you don't get Mercy anywhere else but at the Judgment seat cuz the Judgment seat is the mercy seat and then the Judgment seat becomes The Mercy Seat when when the blood which is the life is upon the Judgment seat it becomes a mercy seat so what did the blood represent it represented the life what is the life the life is the life of Jesus Christ where is it it's in the church it's upon the Judgment seat making it a mercy seat because you can only get Mercy at a judgment seat if you say hey I've committed this crime and I've done this and I've done that you've got to go before some judge somewhere to get acquitted of that to have mercy there's got to be somebody that'll be that has the right to judge and that person with the right to judge is the only one that has the right to give Mercy the police officer can't give you Mercy the one who arrested you the one who keeps you in jail none of them can give you Mercy only at the Judgment seat can you find mercy God Amen why did he move from priesthood into judge because he's no longer covering for the sins of ignorance through the church ages he's brought the fullness of the word now the fullness of the word is available he's not covering for sins of ignorance now he's now he's here as a judge but he's still offering Mercy to those who can come to it
