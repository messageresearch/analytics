[16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, we're just glad
[16:18] this morning and I'm glad to be back
[16:21] here once again.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I just uh told brother Chad,
[16:26] he called me this morning and said,
[16:28] "Yeah, I'm happy to be here, but still
[16:30] there's a portion that is vacuum because
[16:33] you're not around." Uh, amen. But really
[16:37] appreciate the trust and confidence. you
[16:39] know, pastors are the most suspicious
[16:42] personalities in the church, you know,
[16:45] but uh I really feel uh being trusted
[16:50] and uh so this is a family for me. Amen.
[16:54] Uh so we're just so glad to uh uh so I
[16:58] bring greetings from my family, my
[17:00] congregation. Uh Ber Dondon just
[17:03] preached in our church and he send
[17:06] greetings to you as well. Amen. and and
[17:08] all the ministers that are associated
[17:10] with uh this little ministry that the
[17:13] Lord has entrusted us. Uh Amen. Uh they
[17:17] all send greetings. Amen. So God bless
[17:21] you, brother Brian, the family. Amen. Of
[17:23] course, uh children of brother Chad, I
[17:26] saw brother Garner in the in the
[17:28] audience. So thanks for the Holopul
[17:31] family for taking good care of me and
[17:33] the the rest of the brethren. All of
[17:35] you, we love you. And uh uh so it's just
[17:39] a wonderful experience and of course I'm
[17:43] excited because this evening we will be
[17:46] hitting the road all the way to the
[17:49] airport uh because I don't want to be
[17:52] nervous tomorrow. I'm flying back home
[17:54] to Manila mid uh midday tomorrow. So
[17:58] it's better to stay in the airport
[18:01] rather than getting nervous on the way
[18:03] to the airport. Amen. So
[18:07] uh all right. So I see sister Marty in
[18:10] the uh audience this morning but the
[18:12] Lord is leading me in this direction. We
[18:15] uh we we met in Phoenix. So this is part
[18:18] two
[18:20] of what uh uh the Lord has placed in my
[18:25] heart. Okay. So
[18:28] uh let's read directly from
[18:31] uh the Bible from the scriptures.
[18:35] Uh
[18:36] so we would like to speak something
[18:39] about the daughters of the firstborn.
[18:43] Amen.
[18:44] Uh and uh we have subtitle on that the
[18:49] bride's battle for inheritance. Amen.
[18:52] And just the Lord will uh give us some
[18:55] kind of inspiration and encouragement of
[18:58] uh this part of the scripture in the Old
[19:00] Testament. Let's read from the book of
[19:03] uh numbers uh chapter 27.
[19:09] Amen. In the book of numbers chapter 27
[19:13] we read
[19:15] uh
[19:17] uh so in verse one then came the
[19:20] daughters of cilopihad the son of heer
[19:23] the son of Gilead the son of Makir the
[19:26] son of Manasse of the families of
[19:29] Manasse the son of Joseph and these are
[19:32] the names of his daughters Mala Noah and
[19:36] Hogla and Mila and Tiraza
[19:40] And they stood before Moses and before
[19:44] Elazar the priest and before the princes
[19:46] and all the congregation by the door of
[19:48] the tabernacle of the congregation
[19:50] saying, "Our father died in the
[19:53] wilderness, and he was not in the
[19:56] company of them that gathered themselves
[19:58] together against the Lord in the company
[20:01] of Kora, but died in his own sin and had
[20:04] no sons.
[20:06] Why should the name of our father be
[20:09] done away from among his family? Because
[20:11] he hath no son. Give unto us therefore a
[20:16] possession among the brethren of our
[20:18] father. And Moses brought their cause
[20:21] before the Lord.
[20:24] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[20:27] The daughters of Zilopiad speak right.
[20:30] Thou shalt surely, Thou shalt surely
[20:32] give them a possession of an inheritance
[20:35] among their father's brethren, and thou
[20:38] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[20:40] father to pass unto them. And thou shalt
[20:42] speak unto the children of Israel,
[20:44] saying, If a man die, and have no son,
[20:48] then ye shall cause his inheritance to
[20:50] pass unto his daughter. And if he has no
[20:53] daughter, then ye shall give his
[20:55] inheritance unto his brethren. And if he
[20:59] has no brethren, then ye shall give his
[21:02] inheritance unto his father's brethren.
[21:04] And if his father have no brethren, then
[21:07] ye shall give his inheritance unto his
[21:10] kinsman that is next to him of his
[21:13] family, and he shall possess it, and it
[21:16] shall be unto the children of Israel, a
[21:18] statute of judgment, as the Lord
[21:21] commanded Moses.
[21:24] Amen. Let's all bow our heads in prayer.
[21:26] Dear heavenly father, we thank you for
[21:29] this wonderful day that you have given
[21:31] us. And Lord, there's nothing we can say
[21:37] except you speak through this mouth,
[21:40] Lord. And we need revelation from you.
[21:44] That is something that steers our faith
[21:46] to keep us moving, to keep pressing on.
[21:49] And so I uh really appreciate Lord uh to
[21:53] stand behind this pullpit with the full
[21:55] trust and confidence. Amen. For the man
[21:59] that you have ordained uh uh in this
[22:02] assembly Lord. So we commit everything
[22:05] Lord into your mighty hands as we give
[22:06] you Lord glory and the honor in Jesus
[22:09] Christ's wonderful name. And everybody
[22:11] say amen this morning. Hallelujah. God
[22:14] bless you. Amen. You may be seated. Uh
[22:19] so as we made mention would like to
[22:21] speak about
[22:24] uh the daughters of the uh the
[22:28] firstborn. Amen. So you see uh the
[22:33] uh
[22:35] the the name the name Zilopead
[22:40] amen is
[22:42] uh uh actually meaning firstborn.
[22:46] Zilopead means firstborn.
[22:50] So, and he has five daughters in this
[22:53] story. He has five daughters. And let me
[22:56] put the first quote here. Uh when
[23:00] brother Brandham was uh uh beyond the
[23:03] curtain of time and he had uh such a
[23:09] awesome experience and he said there's
[23:12] nothing like it. Amen. It's there's no
[23:15] amount of words to describe the the
[23:19] dimension the realm that the Lord placed
[23:22] him. And uh I believe uh uh I know of
[23:29] Paul uh being translated also in that
[23:34] real Amen. And uh uh Paul is like a
[23:40] father to us also in faith. Amen.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; And so he's the father to his
[23:47] generation.
[23:48] And at the same time in this generation,
[23:52] the Lord sent us a messenger,
[23:55] &gt;&gt; a prophet.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Who is also uh uh as Paul said, I have
[24:01] begotten you.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; And the same thought, the same statement
[24:07] was also quoted by brother Brandham
[24:09] referring to this age. He said, "I have
[24:12] begotten you." Amen. Through this gospel
[24:15] and I am your children. Amen. So that's
[24:19] why we are offspring.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are all offsprings of this
[24:25] message of the hour. Amen. We are being
[24:28] birthed. Amen. By this message of the
[24:31] hour. Amen. And as uh so uh beyond the
[24:34] curtain of time, there was there was a
[24:36] voice and and the voice said, "Amen."
[24:38] Well, this is perfection. said, "This is
[24:41] like the patriarchs when they gathered
[24:44] with their people." He said, "This is
[24:46] after that." Yes. I turned and looked
[24:47] back. There was still laying on the bed
[24:50] and he said, "This is after that." And
[24:52] said, "Oh, then I've died." Well, this
[24:54] is wonderful. This is good for me to be
[24:56] here. I like this. So, it's good to die.
[25:02] Amen. But it must be on God's time. Of
[25:04] course. Amen. So uh uh of course we know
[25:07] that brother Bham didn't die but he was
[25:10] he was transported into that real Amen
[25:13] to be a witness.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be uh uh to be also the
[25:18] firstborn
[25:20] of this age. Amen. And I said well I can
[25:24] understand. I say
[25:27] all these broms.
[25:30] So he was thinking in his heart. Amen.
[25:33] So he he was with his family. Yeah.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Are are these Branhams?"
[25:39] Amen.
[25:40] Look like millions of them.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; I said, "All these Branamites?" No. All
[25:47] these Branhams,
[25:49] Amen. No. They said that boy said they
[25:53] are your converts.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Meaning they are the result of
[25:59] your ministry.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the fruit of the message
[26:03] of the hour. They are your converts.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, but we we of course we
[26:10] understand that. Amen. It's not brother
[26:11] Benham who converted us. It's the word.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Christ who has converted us
[26:16] in this generation. Amen. So from that
[26:19] point of view, Amen. From that point of
[26:21] view, Amen. Zilopiad being the father
[26:24] and he had five children. Amen. And Paul
[26:27] in his generation, he said he's going to
[26:29] present his his converts in his
[26:32] generation and all through the ages.
[26:34] Amen. All the messengers in its age.
[26:38] Amen. They were uh h uh uh they were the
[26:42] undersheperd in their generation.
[26:44] They're messengers. And and the message
[26:46] tells us that in every age the messenger
[26:49] is but an example for that age. So that
[26:54] means whatever whatever the messenger
[26:58] experience whatever God reveals to that
[27:01] messenger in the age and the day and age
[27:04] that they are living in it is in the
[27:06] same measure. It is in the same pattern.
[27:10] Amen. And it will produce the same
[27:12] result.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will produce sons and daughters
[27:16] of God.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now let's see. So we we
[27:22] we uh we get that. So from that point of
[27:25] view, so he is Copied is the father and
[27:27] and he had five daughters. All right. So
[27:32] let's read in numbers 27:1. He said,
[27:36] "Then came the daughters of Zilopiad,
[27:38] the son of Heer, the son of Gilead, the
[27:40] son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the
[27:43] families of Manasse, the son of Joseph.
[27:46] And these are the names of his
[27:47] daughters. Mala, Noah, and Hogla, and
[27:50] Mila, and Tarsa. And they, it gives me
[27:53] uh a reminder of the five wise virgins.
[27:58] Amen. And you know what the five wise
[28:01] virgins are? Amen. They type the bride.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh they have the full measure.
[28:08] Amen. They had they had that extra oil
[28:12] for the extra journey. Amen. And uh uh
[28:16] uh uh that speaks about amen that speaks
[28:18] about amen the Holy Ghost in their
[28:21] generation and the Holy Ghost has
[28:23] something to do amen with the with the
[28:26] with the word of God in the day and age
[28:29] that we are living in. So that means the
[28:32] Holy Spirit amen will lead us into all
[28:35] truth. Amen. And this all truth will
[28:38] bring us amen to the pardonance of the
[28:41] gospel in this generation that the
[28:43] denominations cannot meet. Amen. Because
[28:47] &gt;&gt; uh uh uh they missed the oil in this age
[28:50] that we are living in. Hallelujah. And
[28:53] this is this is the journey. Amen. And I
[28:55] believe everything that we have need of
[28:57] in this earthly journey is all in the
[29:00] message that we have heard.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we are we are
[29:04] feasting on that. So now
[29:08] uh
[29:11] we have we have seen now if zilopiad
[29:15] means daughter or or uh the firstborn.
[29:19] Now look at the definition the meaning
[29:23] of the names amen of his daughters.
[29:28] Number one mahala means forgiven.
[29:34] uh in other uh terms it call it it's
[29:38] it's it's disease because uh uh Zopiad
[29:41] the Bible said he died in his own sin
[29:45] but look at the eldest daughter it means
[29:49] forgiven
[29:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah so I believe this uh not this
[29:56] is this is not an accident
[29:58] &gt;&gt; amen soiad
[30:00] and his wife back then were inspired by
[30:03] the Lord. Amen. Because
[30:07] uh uh he was a normal person. Uh uh so
[30:11] he died in the wilderness.
[30:14] But so the meaning amen of his first
[30:18] daughter Mala means forgiven.
[30:22] But now in this generation we understand
[30:24] that we are not just forgiven.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; We are being justified.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh and Noah Noah means
[30:38] uh movement
[30:42] uh and a movement has something to do
[30:44] with a campaign or uh some kind of a
[30:48] revival.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So some uh so uh uh that means
[30:55] Noah is has something to do with an
[30:58] attraction.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, it's a movement. It it's a
[31:02] that that that there's a a certain
[31:04] direction that uh uh uh it it it is
[31:07] creating some kind of attention or
[31:10] attraction. So that is what this message
[31:12] is all about.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now remember the
[31:18] first time you have heard that you were
[31:22] not just forgiven but you were
[31:24] justified.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means everything that we have
[31:28] done before is not just forgiven but
[31:32] everything was thrown in God's sea of
[31:34] God's forgetfulness and he remembers it
[31:37] no more
[31:38] &gt;&gt; as if you have not done it in the first
[31:41] place.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God don't remember. There is
[31:45] no record on file. And if you when we
[31:48] got that kind of revelation, oh we want
[31:50] to jump. We want to there is something
[31:52] in us that has been steered
[31:55] &gt;&gt; because in our own way we cannot make it
[31:59] &gt;&gt; in our way own way. We cannot go back to
[32:01] God. Amen. But thank God he justified us
[32:05] through his blood. He justified us.
[32:08] Amen. And so then after a while so the
[32:11] the the first experience the first
[32:12] feeling is for us. Amen. To get revived
[32:15] deep inside.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why when when this uh
[32:21] historian during the the Welsh revival
[32:23] that brother Brana made mention he said
[32:25] you know uh they were looking they went
[32:28] to a certain place they went to wells
[32:30] and they they were looking for a place.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were searching and they were
[32:37] asking every person where is that wells
[32:40] revival and they come across with with a
[32:43] man a policeman. Amen. Yeah. whistling
[32:46] and uh rolling his, you know, walking
[32:49] around. Amen. And and then they asked
[32:51] him, "Amen. Do you know, can you lead
[32:53] us? Do you know where that Wells revival
[32:55] is?" He said, "Huh? Well, revival."
[32:58] Amen. You know, he did not point them to
[33:00] a certain place.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; He did not point them to any
[33:04] geographical location.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revival, you look at me.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're just looking right into it.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the same thing. I'm
[33:15] looking right into it. That's a real
[33:17] revival. Amen. People who have, you
[33:19] know, you've been changed. Amen. Uh uh
[33:22] something deep inside of us.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is rejoicing because we
[33:27] found out that we are being justified.
[33:30] Then something has taken has come out of
[33:34] that.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we have reason to
[33:37] rejoice. We have reason to come to the
[33:39] church. We have reason to spend time.
[33:42] Amen. Uh listening for this message.
[33:44] this day and and and we we don't get
[33:47] tired
[33:48] &gt;&gt; going to church fellowshipping
[33:51] regardless you know uh how much time we
[33:53] spend fellowshipping we love him why
[33:56] what do you call that you're looking at
[33:58] it
[33:59] &gt;&gt; amen so that's mean that's the meaning
[34:02] of the the word Noah amen and then next
[34:05] to that mila
[34:09] mila means queen Praise
[34:12] &gt;&gt; God.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Where is the bride sitting?
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:21] &gt;&gt; The bride is sitting with him in his
[34:24] throne.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And actually, we're not
[34:27] looking uh into that time in the future.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; We are right now sitting in heavenly
[34:34] places in Christ Jesus. Glory to God.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bride, no one, no one sits
[34:41] beside the king except the queen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; So that is our position.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the bride's position.
[34:49] Amen. Being the queen.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember uh uh queen Esther.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; King Asiru said, "Que Esther, you are my
[35:00] queen."
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak.
[35:04] Just say what you want
[35:07] &gt;&gt; and you're going to have it.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know if you're the queen,
[35:12] King Asu said, I can give you even half
[35:17] of my kingdom.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that is the position of the
[35:22] queen. And you know the uh when when you
[35:26] say I can give you half of my kingdom
[35:30] uh
[35:32] it does not literally means
[35:35] 5050
[35:38] &gt;&gt; that there is boundary. Amen. I am the
[35:41] king so I own uh up to this this border
[35:47] &gt;&gt; and you are the queen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; That's your border.
[35:52] That's not it.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when you are the queen, I can
[35:56] give you even half of my kingdom. That
[35:59] means you have the equal.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; What he owns,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; you own.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; It's not half.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But everything. That's why. Amen.
[36:13] If we know that we own what he owns, we
[36:17] surrender all.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We do not reserve anything. That's
[36:22] like husband and wife. There is no more
[36:24] reservation between husband and wife.
[36:26] Amen. Because what the husband possess,
[36:30] the wife possesses also.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you know your position
[36:36] this morning that you are the queen, you
[36:38] own what he owns.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why we're not afraid.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. To ask anything.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't be like that small BTPs
[36:50] in the Pacific Ocean who's not who's so
[36:53] afraid. Oh, I can reserve. I cannot, you
[36:55] know, I have to drink a little bit
[36:58] because maybe sometime in the future I
[37:00] will.
[37:02] No,
[37:04] we're just little bitty piece. Amen. In
[37:06] the property of the king, brothers and
[37:09] sisters. Hallelujah. Amen. So that is,
[37:12] you know, you have the share to the
[37:14] throne. Amen. Because you're the queen.
[37:15] That's the position of the bride. And
[37:17] tearsa means pleasing.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Godraise.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes you uh people wonder,
[37:26] you know,
[37:28] uh we're we're we're not after the
[37:30] physical appearance whatsoever. But
[37:32] people from the outside sometimes,
[37:35] you see, she's so beautiful. How come
[37:38] [Laughter]
[37:40] she choose this, you know?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know it's not only
[37:45] love is blind.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; But you know your bride the bride is the
[37:54] apple of the eye of the husband.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's why I told sometimes you
[37:59] know in the morning it doesn't matter
[38:02] what kind of pride egg you have
[38:06] &gt;&gt; your wife present on the table. Amen.
[38:09] You always say praise the Lord. This is
[38:12] the best egg for the day.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Although although it was different
[38:19] from what it was presented yesterday.
[38:22] Amen. Sometimes it's you know it's
[38:24] medium, sometime it's overcooked but
[38:28] that is the best for the day because it
[38:30] is your bride's presentation.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So there is nothing wrong in
[38:36] the bride through the eyes of the
[38:39] husband.
[38:42] Amen. It happened way back in Genesis.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; It continued on until today.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride remains the apple
[38:54] of the eye of the bridegroom, the Lord
[38:58] Jesus Christ. Aren't you glad this
[38:59] morning? Amen. So, hogla means circling,
[39:02] dancing, worshipper. So, though for this
[39:05] reason it is also the word, Amen. It's
[39:07] it's it means partridge. Amen. So it's
[39:10] worship. Hogla means worship. So
[39:15] serving the Lord, worshiping is part of
[39:18] our worship is part of our service to
[39:21] the Lord.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I like that line.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let our lives continue to worship
[39:29] him.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Because worship is something that gives
[39:33] good smell.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; In the nose of the Lord. Yeah.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Something that smells good.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it is it is our form of
[39:43] worship. That's why everything that they
[39:45] put on top of the on top of the altar,
[39:47] that's their worship. They burn it.
[39:50] Amen. And and and and all you know the
[39:53] the the aroma, Amen. It goes and it it
[39:56] becomes so good. Amen. In the smell of
[39:58] the Lord. That's worship.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you you you may dance,
[40:03] you may jump, you may run, you may you
[40:05] you know uh but but but somehow Amen. Uh
[40:09] uh what gives the aroma
[40:13] &gt;&gt; what gives the aroma of our worship Amen
[40:16] is the life.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; That we put on the altar.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. in every age. Remember remember
[40:23] the uh uh those martyrs in the
[40:26] generation that went before us during
[40:29] the during the inquisition during the
[40:31] martyrdom. Amen. you know the the uh
[40:37] those uh the historian I believe that
[40:39] was his said you know how could God how
[40:42] could the god that the people worship
[40:45] could just you know cross his arms like
[40:49] that and and watch them
[40:52] &gt;&gt; amen they could not understand
[40:55] how a judge just god can can can you
[40:58] know take that kind of situation people
[41:01] are being burnt at stake amen Amen. But
[41:04] what makes it? It's the life that was in
[41:07] them.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The life that was in them becomes
[41:11] the aroma.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It smells good. Their lives.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You know the
[41:19] substance. Amen. It's the substance. And
[41:21] and there's nothing more Amen. than the
[41:24] substance of life that we live. Amen.
[41:26] Now, uh look at this in in in the next
[41:29] quote. He said, "Now remember this.
[41:31] Christ in the true church is a
[41:34] continuation of the book of Acts. But
[41:37] the book of Revelation shows how that
[41:39] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[41:41] the church and defile it, making it
[41:43] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It
[41:46] exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[41:49] attempted destruction of God's people,
[41:51] and the discrediting of God's word.
[41:54] We're in that age now.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; They try to discredit this word, this
[41:58] message that we believe. Amen. by trying
[42:01] to discredit the prophet.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We'll come to that later on. Amen.
[42:08] Remember this age, this generation is
[42:11] trying to discredit, disrespect the
[42:15] prophet of God that he has vindicated
[42:19] &gt;&gt; for the hour. Amen. So now he said
[42:23] attempted destruction of God's people
[42:25] and the discrediting of God's word right
[42:28] down to the time he is cast into the
[42:29] lake of fire. He fights that he cannot
[42:32] stand it. He knows that if the people
[42:35] get the true revelation of the true
[42:37] church and what she is
[42:41] &gt;&gt; not like what who she is but what she
[42:45] is.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. and what she stands for and that
[42:50] she can do the greater works. She will
[42:53] be an invincible army. Look at this
[42:57] statement. She can do greater works.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Look at the confidence of God to the
[43:04] bride of Christ in this generation.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That she can do greater works.
[43:11] Why? Because there are greater
[43:13] challenges in this day and age that we
[43:16] are living in.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The enemy is coming like a
[43:21] flood.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; But thank God, God has lifted up a
[43:25] standard. He has lifted us a word.
[43:28] Hallelujah. The message where we when
[43:31] when when the when we meet, Amen. the
[43:33] standard of this generation, we don't
[43:35] care what's going on outside. We don't
[43:37] care what's going in this age.
[43:39] Hallelujah. We have we are already
[43:42] settled in this message.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But everything Amen that Satan
[43:47] will always try to discredit. Amen. Now
[43:51] another thing he said now the bride
[43:52] knows where she stands. She's very few.
[43:56] You know you combine all the message
[43:59] believers
[44:00] uh in Ohio. Amen. One one mega church in
[44:06] the denomination. We're just like this.
[44:09] Right.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just like this. Hallelujah.
[44:13] She's just very very few. There won't be
[44:15] many say just a very very few. You say,
[44:18] "Well, there's a thousand." Yeah, but
[44:19] they've come up through the 2,000 years.
[44:22] Amen. So, now let's move on. Now, let's
[44:26] see after defining all these uh uh uh
[44:30] terms of the daughters of Zilopiad.
[44:34] Now, let's see what they did.
[44:38] He said in numbers 27,
[44:41] he said in verse 5, "And they stood
[44:45] before Moses."
[44:47] They stood, meaning they stand.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; They know where they are.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; They know what they are. They know who
[44:57] they are.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; And they know where to go to.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. They have a claim.
[45:08] They stood before Moses and before
[45:10] Elizar
[45:12] the priest and before the princes and
[45:14] all the congregation by the Torah of the
[45:17] tabernacle of the congregation. Amen.
[45:19] And of course they have presented their
[45:21] claim. Amen. So what I would like to say
[45:25] is that Amen. these daughters of
[45:28] Zilopiad
[45:30] they were taught right.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. by their father.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Their father was no longer around. Amen.
[45:38] But they were there
[45:40] and they had nothing
[45:44] &gt;&gt; except the revelation.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Of what they are.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Except the revelation of who their
[45:57] father was. Yes. Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; We were daughters of Zilopead.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now the main thing is that
[46:07] this they have their claim.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't uh define that
[46:13] as complain. They have their claim.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; What's their claim? Their inheritance
[46:20] &gt;&gt; that belong to their father
[46:22] &gt;&gt; who was a firstborn.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; But number one, because they know who
[46:29] they are, what they are, what they are
[46:32] supposed to claim. Now, on top of that,
[46:35] they know where to go to.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; They approached Moses.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; And you put that in in in a micro
[46:48] presentation. Moses was their pastor.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; So they did not go to other church.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; They did not approach other ministers.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; About their claim.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; They did not go from one house to
[47:06] another
[47:08] &gt;&gt; to present their issue.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; They go to their pastor.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; They go to the prophet. And they stood
[47:19] before Moses and before Elizar the
[47:21] priest.
[47:23] and before the princes and all the
[47:24] congregation of the door of tabernacle
[47:27] of the congregation.
[47:29] Amen. Saying we'll come to that later
[47:32] on. So now because they did the right
[47:35] thing, they approached the right person.
[47:38] Amen. If we go on if we jump in in verse
[47:41] 5, it says, "And Moses brought their
[47:44] cause before the Lord."
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to see, Amen. in this in
[47:51] this presentation that there was no
[47:56] record in the Old Testament prior to
[47:59] this case
[48:01] that women
[48:03] received inheritance.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; No, no record.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; They had no proof.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; There was no reference
[48:18] &gt;&gt; to their case.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Y But these women knew where to go.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; And you know Moses the prophet, Moses
[48:27] the pastor probably.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; First time.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And because of the way they presented
[48:36] their case,
[48:38] Moses did not jump immediately saying,
[48:41] "You women, you be silent.
[48:46] You're not supposed to speak.
[48:50] Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; It is already we have we have records
[48:54] before that only the firstborn and the
[48:59] firstborn after amen onwards.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Received the inheritance.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Moses could have read you
[49:08] could have stated don't you see
[49:11] &gt;&gt; all records that we have no women
[49:15] &gt;&gt; receive inheritance.
[49:18] Amen. So why come here and present their
[49:20] case? You just be silent.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses,
[49:27] because he was vindicated by the Lord,
[49:30] he was not quick
[49:33] &gt;&gt; to give conclusion.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. To cut them short.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; But Moses brought their cause before the
[49:42] Lord.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Moses spent time.
[49:46] Amen. He approached God. Hallelujah. And
[49:50] this is what I want to say. When we do
[49:52] the right thing, Amen. And we approach
[49:54] the right person, we go to the right
[49:57] place. Amen. That's why, you know, in
[49:59] the voice of the sign, you know, brother
[50:02] said, we believe that every Christian
[50:04] ought to have a home church that they go
[50:06] to. That's why you're here.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is your home church.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have your pastor.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every Christian ought to meet
[50:16] somewhere with believers. And wherever
[50:18] you meet, that's the church.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; So God has pre-planned.
[50:27] Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; If he has predestinated you from
[50:31] eternity to eternity, he also has
[50:33] predestinated us. Who is supposed to be
[50:36] our pastor?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was called to be a pastor. that
[50:41] that's why God has predestinated me a
[50:43] people to pastor to.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah. Amen. Elijah. When God
[50:48] sent Elijah to uh to Sarah, there is
[50:51] already a widow waiting for him there.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's this? God.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Elijah didn't have to to make a a
[51:00] a a a great revival or somewhere. Amen.
[51:04] Hallelujah. But he just got there. But
[51:06] but God said, "I have prepared a widow
[51:09] there."
[51:10] Amen. So that's the main thing. If God I
[51:12] believe God has called me in the
[51:14] ministry, God has prepared a people for
[51:17] me.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we go to missions,
[51:19] Hallelujah. And we believe that God sent
[51:22] us there, God prepared people there. God
[51:24] has prepared souls there.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I remember once again,
[51:30] let me testify on this. So along with
[51:32] with with my uh murma, I want to drop
[51:35] some uh uh pew uh mission works. Amen.
[51:39] And and you see now in in in Indonesia,
[51:41] remember I always remember this because
[51:44] uh in 2003, Amen. This is the first
[51:46] independent uh outreach that I had
[51:49] outside of the Philippines. And so we
[51:52] went I went to Indonesia 2003. And in
[51:55] 2003, there were we were only working
[51:57] with uh uh three churches at that time.
[52:00] Amen. And uh by God's grace we were able
[52:03] to introduce what you know as I
[52:05] mentioned to you what they have been
[52:06] doing in the Philippines you know about
[52:08] the mystery exposition and and shared
[52:10] them about you know not to uh uh because
[52:14] this is another way of sharing the
[52:16] message.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Uh we don't mention brother Brandham's
[52:21] name immediately.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; We don't ask the denominational leaders
[52:26] do you believe that that God sent forth
[52:28] a prophet in this generation? Amen. No,
[52:31] we don't believe. Oh, you're a serpent
[52:32] seat.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; We don't do that. Amen. But what we do,
[52:37] we share them the word.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We share them the word. Amen. And
[52:40] and as we present them uh uh the word.
[52:43] Amen. Uh uh we present the book of
[52:45] Revelation. And most of the time they
[52:47] have similar they have similar
[52:49] responses. They say, "Oh, we have not
[52:51] heard the book of Revelation presented
[52:53] that way."
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, they have the
[52:56] pictures. They know the seven golden
[52:58] candlesticks but they don't realize amen
[53:01] that it's not just a picture it's not
[53:03] just an illustration. Amen. But these
[53:05] are message of God.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; There are instruction behind it.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And unless you understand the
[53:12] symbol you will not be able to benefit
[53:14] from it.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so because of that they get
[53:17] you know when you connect the first four
[53:19] seals to the church ages. Amen. They get
[53:22] excited and they see that in the
[53:25] scripture they see the church in
[53:26] history.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; They see what are they are fulfilling.
[53:31] Amen. And suddenly we move on on and on.
[53:34] Amen. And so the the the Lord blessed
[53:36] those uh expo early exposition and
[53:38] immediately 2003 2004 I came back. Amen.
[53:42] And you know fast forward because 2004
[53:45] is too far. It's 20 years already. Amen.
[53:48] So after 20 years, Amen. So this coming
[53:51] October, Lord willing, uh uh uh brother
[53:56] Mahanim told me that they have arranged
[53:59] a a a a camp meeting and they will be
[54:01] gathering. And now we have dozens of
[54:03] churches in Indonesia
[54:05] over 250 million population 90% of them
[54:10] Muslim. But we have Amen. tens of
[54:13] message churches.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now believing this message of the
[54:19] hour and they're doing their own mission
[54:21] works. Why? Amen. There is no big
[54:24] organization. There is no denomination
[54:26] behind it. But God is behind it.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is inspiring his people
[54:32] because this message is is is inspired.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said the word is already
[54:38] inspired. What only needs is somebody
[54:40] who is inspired. And a person that is
[54:43] inspired, who meets the inspired word,
[54:46] the inspired word plus the inspired
[54:48] person, it will produce the right kind
[54:51] of result. Hallelujah. Amen. So that's
[54:54] why now we're so blessed. Amen. And of
[54:56] course recently we have the work now.
[54:58] Amen. You you're you're you're very much
[55:00] involved with that from the very uh
[55:03] first trip that I had. Amen. BCF was uh
[55:06] uh uh behind me. Amen. And now we have
[55:09] established chairs. Little by little is
[55:11] growing. They're doing doing some works
[55:13] on their own also. Amen. So it's it's
[55:16] God behind it. We're just privileged to
[55:19] do our share.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why uh so now so that's why
[55:26] uh he said now uh when when in the
[55:29] message humble thyself uh he said now is
[55:34] this is an illustration of brother
[55:35] Benham. He said there someone was
[55:37] telling me I believe it was my brother
[55:38] back telling a little story today about
[55:41] a man a minister some one of his
[55:43] congregation he said he could walk a log
[55:46] he said pastor sure the Lord is with you
[55:49] there's a river and he said that's a log
[55:52] I can use that lag and cross the river
[55:55] amen congregation said sure pastor
[55:58] you're a man of God you can do that amen
[56:02] he believed his pastor very much amen he
[56:05] said I can pack a lag across my back
[56:07] when I go across. Sure, the Lord is with
[56:10] you. And he went and done it. He said, I
[56:12] can pack a lag and will a wheelbarrow
[56:14] across at the same time. Sure, pastor,
[56:17] the Lord is with you. Your faith can do
[56:20] anything. He said, I can put you in the
[56:22] wheelbarrow.
[56:24] And pack the lag. He say, now wait a
[56:27] minute.
[56:30] He said it's different when you are
[56:32] included in it yourself. Now that it's
[56:35] mighty good for us to say it here. Amen.
[56:38] It's mighty good for us to say I believe
[56:40] that's true. But then put it in action.
[56:42] You got to put it in action.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that means we go with our
[56:48] pastor all the way because we believe
[56:52] God has ordained him to lead us all the
[56:55] way.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just don't say we believe you,
[56:59] brother. We believe what you're doing.
[57:02] We believe that what you say. Amen. But
[57:04] you see, you go all the way.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if the pastor can take the
[57:11] risk, you go all the way.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; So not like So it's different when we're
[57:18] included, we must be included.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; If the Lord gives a vision to the
[57:24] pastor,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. It goes down.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even to the lowest part of his
[57:32] body. That's the same thing. God being
[57:35] the head and we are part of the body.
[57:37] Amen. Uh uh the messenger. Amen. Down to
[57:40] the church age. Amen. Uh uh it's like
[57:44] it's like the the precious ointment that
[57:46] run down from the head of Aaron going
[57:48] down to his beard down to his garment.
[57:51] Everybody
[57:54] &gt;&gt; every member.
[57:56] Amen. We are part of it of the great
[58:00] move.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. in that way. Amen. It's not
[58:05] whatever whatever uh uh uh the pastor
[58:08] accomplished, it's not only attributed
[58:11] to the pastor, but it's the body.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So now let's go back
[58:19] to the uh uh to the children in verse 8.
[58:22] Now look at the basis of their claim.
[58:24] Now they had nothing. He said,
[58:26] "According to his daughters, Cilopead
[58:29] did not rebel against Moses." Let's look
[58:33] in verse three.
[58:36] No reference,
[58:38] no record on file. It never happened
[58:42] before.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; But what was their basis?
[58:48] Amen. said, "Our Father died in the
[58:51] wilderness,
[58:53] and he was not
[58:55] in the company of them that gathered
[58:58] themselves together against the Lord in
[59:02] the company of Kora."
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like this portion. Yeah, we have
[59:09] no basis. We have nothing to offer. But
[59:12] there's one thing we know. Moses,
[59:16] &gt;&gt; there were many men who stood against
[59:19] you
[59:22] &gt;&gt; during the time of challenges, during
[59:24] those years in the wilderness. But we
[59:26] have seen, we have witnessed our father.
[59:29] We have witnessed some uh uh some men
[59:32] visiting our home,
[59:36] convincing our father to go against you.
[59:40] But this one thing we know
[59:43] &gt;&gt; our father, Amen, he was not in the
[59:46] company of them that gathered themselves
[59:48] together against the Lord in the company
[59:51] of Kora.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he died in his own sin. But
[59:54] there's one thing we remember and we
[59:56] will never forget that. Amen. Our father
[59:59] respect you so much, Pastor Moses.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He loved you so much. Hallelujah. Even
[1:00:05] in front of you, behind you. Amen. Even
[1:00:08] if those people we have witnessed them.
[1:00:10] Amen. We they were good men a as we
[1:00:13] witnessed but when when they visited our
[1:00:16] home you you may not find it. I'm just
[1:00:18] giving an illustration.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they said he was not in
[1:00:25] the company of them that gathered
[1:00:27] themselves together against the Lord in
[1:00:31] the company of Kora.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look
[1:00:36] how our children
[1:00:41] can take a hold.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; On how we respect
[1:00:47] the ministry.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And see how it will affect how will they
[1:00:53] benefit along the road
[1:00:56] because of their respect.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we put a quote on that? He
[1:01:01] said, "No." He said, "If you can't
[1:01:03] respect the man, respect the office he
[1:01:05] holds in God." That's exactly right.
[1:01:07] Respect him. If a minister comes up,
[1:01:10] your pastor always respect him. I've
[1:01:12] heard congregations talk about their
[1:01:14] pastor, how just talk about him, run him
[1:01:16] down, ridicule him. How is that pastor
[1:01:19] ever going to do anything to you? He can
[1:01:21] do it. I don't say I don't say this
[1:01:24] church.
[1:01:25] I know you love and respect, Brother
[1:01:27] Chad. Amen. I don't say this church, but
[1:01:30] I mean churches I have sin. And then
[1:01:34] you've got to love your pastor.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; You've got to know that he is a human
[1:01:41] being.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And now let us linger in this next line.
[1:01:45] He said, "But yet God has made him what?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; His
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; pastor,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; not our pastor."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God made him
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; his pastor.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; That means he is God's choice.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; It's not he's not even our own choice.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; God made him his
[1:02:16] pastor.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; He placed you his
[1:02:22] pastor.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Just like those seven stars.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; In the right hand of him.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham said why they
[1:02:36] are in the right hand? Because that
[1:02:39] means they were personally picked.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; They were they were personally chosen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And because they were they were in in in
[1:02:53] the right hand of him who chose them.
[1:02:56] Amen. He is able to protect them. He
[1:02:59] takes good care of them.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] God made him his pastor. The Holy Ghost
[1:03:09] has made him overseer. Then you've got
[1:03:11] to respect him in that manner. And no
[1:03:13] matter what the pastor's done, if you
[1:03:15] respect him in your heart as God's
[1:03:16] servant, God will respect you for doing
[1:03:20] it.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I believe.
[1:03:24] Uh,
[1:03:26] brother Chad will love me more
[1:03:29] [Laughter]
[1:03:31] because I'm saying this in his absence.
[1:03:37] Amen. The Lord God has made him
[1:03:39] overseer, then you've got to respect him
[1:03:41] in that manner. And no matter what the
[1:03:43] pastor done, if you respect him in your
[1:03:45] heart as God's servant, God will respect
[1:03:47] you for doing it.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:52] So let's move forward now. So you see
[1:03:57] now we remember in in we remember in the
[1:03:59] Bible right where Elisha you know Elisha
[1:04:03] uh he was he was a man of God after
[1:04:05] Elijah but there were kids. They were
[1:04:10] ignorant. They were innocent. They knew
[1:04:12] they knew nothing.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; All right. But suddenly here comes
[1:04:17] Elisha. He he passed through and uh uh
[1:04:21] these playful children followed through
[1:04:24] and they lined up and they were mocking.
[1:04:28] They were teasing. They were just
[1:04:30] teasing. Amen. They said, "Oh, look at
[1:04:33] Elijah. He was baldheaded. He was coming
[1:04:35] down the road." And some little children
[1:04:37] began to say, "Old baldhead. Old
[1:04:38] baldhead. Why don't you go up like
[1:04:40] Elijah did?" Making fun of him. Now,
[1:04:42] what was all right? Now, that was all
[1:04:45] right. them little kids. Maybe it was
[1:04:47] their parents that taught them to do
[1:04:49] that. They were little fellows. They
[1:04:52] were making fun of this prophet, but
[1:04:54] they got him angry. And he turned around
[1:04:58] and put a curse on those children in the
[1:05:01] name of the Lord. And two shears come
[1:05:05] out of the woods and killed 42 little
[1:05:08] innocent children.
[1:05:11] Now that sound that don't sound the
[1:05:13] nature of the Holy Spirit. You believe
[1:05:16] that?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he got so emotional.
[1:05:21] But because
[1:05:23] the word of God was in him,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Though he used it out of his emotion, it
[1:05:31] affected the lives of those innocent
[1:05:34] children. Killed them. Little children.
[1:05:37] An angered prophet. He cursed them.
[1:05:39] Children had to be recognized because he
[1:05:42] was a prophet. Hallelujah.
[1:05:46] Amen. So that means and and and and and
[1:05:50] you know brother Bham said you know why
[1:05:52] these little children they lose their
[1:05:55] respect
[1:05:56] to the office. Amen. In the middle he
[1:06:00] said maybe it was their parents
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; maybe on the breakfast table lunch
[1:06:08] dinner they making fun you know and
[1:06:10] suddenly you know sometimes Amen. People
[1:06:14] don't realize
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; that children are just watching and they
[1:06:19] don't take it seriously.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And you know they there might be no
[1:06:25] literal wolves that will be coming out
[1:06:27] to devour the children but this
[1:06:30] represents the devil.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; you know sometimes something uh come out
[1:06:37] you know in in the home and the father
[1:06:39] and the mother and sometimes you don't
[1:06:41] just agree uh on on a little something
[1:06:44] and suddenly the father or the mother
[1:06:46] said we we're not going to church today.
[1:06:50] Amen. And children are watching.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So they think that every time
[1:06:57] there is a problem
[1:07:00] let's not go to church.
[1:07:03] Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And sometimes they talk some sometimes
[1:07:07] issues, you know, there's no church that
[1:07:09] has no problem.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And there's no pastor that has no
[1:07:17] problem.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; And that's why there is a common term,
[1:07:24] if you have a big church, you have big
[1:07:28] problems.
[1:07:31] If you have 100 congregation that means
[1:07:36] amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you don't realize that your
[1:07:39] problem is your pastor's problem.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; But do you realize that the problem of
[1:07:45] your pastor is yours as well?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Big churches big problem.
[1:07:53] Small church
[1:07:55] small problem.
[1:07:58] No church.
[1:08:02] You are the problem.
[1:08:08] Amen. Because we are called to have a
[1:08:11] home church.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that means if you cannot find a
[1:08:14] church to suit you, that means you are
[1:08:17] the problem.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have to thank God because
[1:08:20] you have a home church this morning to
[1:08:22] go to. You are part of it. You belong.
[1:08:24] You have a pastor. Amen. That you have
[1:08:26] to support. Amen. Hallelujah. So we we
[1:08:29] we were so blessed. Amen. So all these
[1:08:32] things. So you come to think of that
[1:08:34] respect. Amen. Respect. Amen. Is
[1:08:37] something that our children experience.
[1:08:40] Amen. They we we influence. Amen. The
[1:08:44] kind of the kind of influence and this
[1:08:46] is the claim right. This is the claim of
[1:08:49] the five daughters. We have not seen our
[1:08:52] father
[1:08:54] spoke against the prophet.
[1:08:57] Amen. And so when the time came, they
[1:09:00] used that basis, Amen. to uh
[1:09:05] uh
[1:09:08] to claim their inheritance.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's move forward now. Let's
[1:09:14] see. In Matthew chapter 27 to 29, 27 to
[1:09:17] 29. Then hallelujah. Look at this. The
[1:09:22] soldiers of the governor took Jesus into
[1:09:25] the common hall and gathered unto him
[1:09:27] the whole band of soldiers. And they
[1:09:29] stripped him and put him in a scarlet
[1:09:32] robe. And when they had platted the
[1:09:33] crown of thorns, they put it upon his
[1:09:36] head and read in his right hand and they
[1:09:38] bowed the knee before him and mocked him
[1:09:40] saying, "Hail, King of the Jews."
[1:09:43] Look at the approach.
[1:09:46] So the approach
[1:09:48] is very important.
[1:09:52] Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; They have the right approach
[1:09:55] to the prophet. Now here comes the
[1:09:58] people during the time of Jesus. They
[1:10:01] also called him king.
[1:10:04] They bowed their knee before him
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; and say hail king of the Jews.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Right? They have they have an outward
[1:10:14] expression.
[1:10:16] They bow their knees. Amen. They called
[1:10:19] him hail king of the Jews.
[1:10:23] Hallelujah. But they didn't have the
[1:10:25] right heart.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had the wrong approach.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "And they stripped him
[1:10:35] and put him in a scarlet robe and when
[1:10:37] they had plotted the crown of thorns and
[1:10:40] they put upon he said and read in his
[1:10:42] right hand and they bowed the knee
[1:10:44] before him and mocked him, saying,
[1:10:45] "Hail, King of the Jews.
[1:10:49] Amen. And he was not only king of the
[1:10:51] Jews, he's king of kings
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; and lord of lords.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And he deserved respect.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; But they so disrespected him.
[1:11:04] And so they did not get the right
[1:11:07] result.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wrong approach.
[1:11:14] Kane, of course, we know how kayen am I?
[1:11:17] My brother's keeper.
[1:11:19] Amen. Psal Psalm 64 in verse four.
[1:11:21] Blessed is the man whom thou chooses and
[1:11:23] causes to approach unto thee that he may
[1:11:27] dwell in thy courts. We shall be
[1:11:29] satisfied with the goodness of thy
[1:11:32] house, even of thy holy temple.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah. So that's why even when we
[1:11:39] come in the tabernacle, the the moment
[1:11:42] you enter there, there must be a right
[1:11:43] approach. Amen. Nobody can enter. Amen.
[1:11:48] A gate cross or somewhere. You have to
[1:11:51] pass through the door.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as you pass through the door,
[1:11:56] you have there the sacrifice, the altar
[1:11:59] before you you enter into the most holy
[1:12:02] place. Hallelujah. There is the right
[1:12:04] approach. Amen. Remember that man in the
[1:12:08] parable, you know, uh hh uh the uh uh uh
[1:12:12] the one who who had the the feast, the
[1:12:15] wedding feast, and one was able to enter
[1:12:18] there. Amen. One was able to enter there
[1:12:22] and he didn't have the wedding garment.
[1:12:25] Where did he come from? Where did he
[1:12:28] pass through?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why in this day and age
[1:12:33] where we have all the information
[1:12:36] available.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; You see you have these AIs you know you
[1:12:41] just you just search and you know you
[1:12:44] can learn about the message.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; You will get you will accumulate a lot
[1:12:51] of information
[1:12:53] about this message of the hour.
[1:12:56] Anybody can you know search about a
[1:12:59] certain topic. Amen. And find out and
[1:13:02] using AI you know what does the message
[1:13:04] tell about this subject something like
[1:13:06] that. Amen. You you can get an
[1:13:08] information but unless you're being led
[1:13:11] by the Holy Ghost. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:15] There is there is a vast different
[1:13:18] difference between information and
[1:13:21] revelation.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may gather all the
[1:13:27] information. Amen. You can compile all
[1:13:30] these books and you can me memorize
[1:13:32] probably pages and and and and paragraph
[1:13:36] and and and particular message and quote
[1:13:39] it one after the other. Amen. So but if
[1:13:43] there is no Amen there is no
[1:13:45] transformation
[1:13:48] there is no life manifestation
[1:13:50] it remains an information and that will
[1:13:53] not bring you to the rapture.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah. Amen. And so now he said
[1:13:57] that there must be the right approach.
[1:13:59] Amen. And so that's the same thing with
[1:14:01] this message of the hour. Amen. And so
[1:14:04] now let's go back uh uh let's go back to
[1:14:07] the book of numbers now. And the Lord
[1:14:09] spake unto Moses saying, "Now Moses
[1:14:12] presented their case." Now, this is the
[1:14:15] sequence of the uh of the the the scene.
[1:14:19] Amen. They presented their cause to
[1:14:21] Moses. And Moses hh uh presented their
[1:14:24] case to the Lord. Amen. And the Lord
[1:14:28] spake unto Moses.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we believe that if we
[1:14:33] present our case to the Lord,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; he answers. Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So Moses and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:14:41] saying, "The daughters of Zilopiad,
[1:14:45] speak right."
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[1:14:53] Amen. The daughters of Celopi had speak
[1:14:56] right. Thou shalt surely give them a
[1:14:59] possession of an inheritance, I'm sorry,
[1:15:03] among their father's brethren. And thou
[1:15:05] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[1:15:08] past father to pass unto them.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the cast here. It never
[1:15:16] happened before. Yeah.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; But because they presented their case to
[1:15:23] the right person, they went to the right
[1:15:25] place and they approached they had the
[1:15:28] right approach.
[1:15:30] Now God instructed Moses. Amen. To give
[1:15:36] them their the inheritance that belong
[1:15:39] to their father which did not happen
[1:15:42] before.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt surely. What's the reason?
[1:15:48] The daughters of Cilopiad speak right.
[1:15:52] Because of that, thou shalt surely give
[1:15:53] them a possession of an inheritance
[1:15:55] among their father's brethren, and thou
[1:15:57] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[1:15:59] father to pass unto them. Amen. So if we
[1:16:03] can quote, Amen. We remember because of
[1:16:05] this right approach, we remember Rahab,
[1:16:08] Amen. Uh uh he he uh accepted uh uh the
[1:16:13] the the spies that Joshua sent. Amen.
[1:16:16] And now moving forward here. Amen. And
[1:16:19] and and and and in paragraph 199,
[1:16:23] you know, prior to that, brother Banner
[1:16:25] was testifying that they they were
[1:16:27] having just a normal fellowship, having
[1:16:29] coffee together with Tetas testifying,
[1:16:33] and there were other brethren. Amen.
[1:16:36] When he was telling about the squirrel,
[1:16:38] telling about, you know, the miracles
[1:16:40] that the Lord had done. Amen. Now, we
[1:16:44] might not know it. We were not there but
[1:16:45] probably some were there present and
[1:16:48] maybe
[1:16:50] uh for them the prophet was you know it
[1:16:53] it must be too good to be true for them.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] But Luke in paragraph 199 after uh
[1:17:03] referring to those squirrels. Amen. God
[1:17:06] being the Jehovah Gyra. He said, "And
[1:17:08] little old quiet sister Haiti
[1:17:12] sitting back there a little dust bonnet
[1:17:15] on like the country women were there.
[1:17:18] And she put on a little clean dress to
[1:17:20] come over to help her mother cook me a
[1:17:22] dinner." And she was sitting with her
[1:17:25] hand like this. And she said, "That's
[1:17:28] nothing but the truth."
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's nothing but the truth.
[1:17:38] She said the right thing.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Here's my Bible. And as a servant of
[1:17:46] God, I say this, I could hardly hear the
[1:17:48] last. She said her mother was trying to
[1:17:51] say something, but I didn't get it. Just
[1:17:53] as she said, she said that she said the
[1:17:56] right thing. The spirit of the Lord said
[1:17:59] to me, tell her to ask what she will and
[1:18:03] you
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; give it to her.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You know, sons and daughters of God.
[1:18:13] Amen. We were
[1:18:16] declared that we can speak a word and
[1:18:20] that word will come into existence and
[1:18:22] we can live into that.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe in a simple illustration,
[1:18:28] you know, our words can create an
[1:18:30] atmosphere.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It creates an atmosphere.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; If you look to each other, Amen. You
[1:18:42] know, sometimes uh uh uh remember one
[1:18:46] time, brother Brennan, you know, he just
[1:18:48] arrived home and and here comes the
[1:18:50] wife. you know, she was kind of uh
[1:18:54] frustrated, irritated, you know, the
[1:18:57] these these girls playing and doing all
[1:19:00] the house chores and everything and you
[1:19:03] know,
[1:19:05] some sort of expression. Amen.
[1:19:10] Of a tired mother in the home, tired
[1:19:14] wife in the home.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; But when she when when he heard when
[1:19:19] brother Brandham heard that Hallelujah,
[1:19:23] he didn't say, "Don't you realize I come
[1:19:26] from the mission work?"
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; he spoke the thing.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Just a little embrace and said, "Just
[1:19:37] take a rest. Let me do the rest."
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It changed the atmosphere.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It changed the atmosphere.
[1:19:47] And I believe it's the same thing.
[1:19:49] Hallelujah.
[1:19:51] Because there is power in the word that
[1:19:54] when we speak the right thing, it
[1:19:56] creates the right atmosphere.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And because of that very simple
[1:20:03] statement,
[1:20:05] I believe that, brother Brennan.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; I believe what you said. Hallelujah. And
[1:20:12] we know the rest of the story. And he
[1:20:14] said, "I couldn't speak that room.
[1:20:16] Everybody felt strange." I said, "Sister
[1:20:18] Hetti," she said, "Yes, brother
[1:20:19] Brennan." I said, "Thus saith the Lord."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Speak anything that you desire.
[1:20:27] I don't care what it is. If you want to
[1:20:30] know what God has given this ministry,
[1:20:34] speak anything that you desire. Thus
[1:20:37] sayaeth the Lord, if you'll speak it,
[1:20:40] I'll speak it behind you and you'll have
[1:20:43] it right there. Eight people standing
[1:20:46] there looking.
[1:20:48] Amen. Thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Just a simple statement,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; brother Brennan, that's nothing but the
[1:21:00] truth.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That creates an atmosphere.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah. Because something good was
[1:21:07] spoken to the prophet.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:13] No, no hesitance, no refusal, no
[1:21:15] resistance.
[1:21:17] Just believe.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Because she believed. She respected the
[1:21:21] prophet that God vindicated. Amen.
[1:21:24] Brother Brenham. That's nothing but the
[1:21:26] truth. Amen. With just little excitement
[1:21:29] in her heart. Brother Brandham, that's
[1:21:31] nothing but the truth.
[1:21:34] Amen. He changed the atmosphere.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah. The earthly simple home
[1:21:40] atmosphere changed and that presence
[1:21:43] went Hallelujah. Amen. That presence
[1:21:46] went reach up to the uh uh to the
[1:21:49] service. Amen. And and and and God was
[1:21:52] so true in his word. Amen. And so she
[1:21:55] said, "Brother Brennham, what shall I
[1:21:56] say?"
[1:21:59] I said, "It's up to you."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] So I mentioned this before and you know
[1:22:07] that brother Brandham you know he he
[1:22:08] made he he he he gave a a a choice an
[1:22:12] option. Amen. But you know
[1:22:16] God trust
[1:22:19] that woman so much.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; God knew what was in the mind and heart
[1:22:28] of that woman.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was in such a place in
[1:22:34] such a real in such a condition of her
[1:22:37] faith that when she speaks she speaks
[1:22:40] the right thing.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There was nothing wrong if
[1:22:44] she has healing. There was nothing wrong
[1:22:46] if she asked for some wealth. There's
[1:22:48] nothing wrong with that because it was
[1:22:51] supported by a thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But even then she did not
[1:22:58] only say the right thing to brother
[1:23:01] Brham. Brother Brham that's nothing but
[1:23:03] the truth. That's right. But even under
[1:23:07] the atmosphere of thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:23:10] Hallelujah. Hey the right spoke the
[1:23:13] right thing.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; He she spoke the right choice. I want
[1:23:17] the salvation of my two sons.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; She asked for salvation. Hallelujah.
[1:23:24] Amen. I believe. Hallelujah. That same
[1:23:26] thus sayaeth the Lord is in the bride
[1:23:28] right now. Hallelujah. We can claim our
[1:23:31] children. We can claim our parents. We
[1:23:33] can speak the right thing. Hallelujah.
[1:23:35] And have passion for their souls.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; While we are still here, hallelujah. The
[1:23:41] the bride is being placed in such a
[1:23:44] position. The voice of God is where? In
[1:23:48] the bride.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God is God is expecting.
[1:23:54] God is has an assurance to to entrust
[1:23:57] his voice to us to the bride.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why that is our
[1:24:02] focus in this generation. We don't want
[1:24:05] you know it's not our desire to get
[1:24:06] rich. Why we are we're having business.
[1:24:09] We're we're working. Amen. Our young
[1:24:11] people are going to school studying.
[1:24:14] Amen. Our main focus is not just to get
[1:24:16] rich, get some higher grades and finish
[1:24:19] our course and so on. Hallelujah. a a
[1:24:22] person that is converted. Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] That's why brother Bham said uh preach
[1:24:26] about convinced and concerned.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are fully convinced by
[1:24:31] this message of the hour. Hallelujah.
[1:24:34] And that conviction does not stop to us
[1:24:37] alone.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; We are concerned.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are concerned for souls.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh uh I was testifying to uh to
[1:24:48] the brothers to brother Jeriah and of
[1:24:51] course to the brother Steven and brother
[1:24:52] Franco while we we were having dinner.
[1:24:54] Amen. You know while while I'm still
[1:24:56] here. Amen. While while I'm still here
[1:25:00] uh uh uh I received three weeks ago I
[1:25:03] received a uh a message from a person I
[1:25:07] don't remember
[1:25:09] and said uh Pastor Danny can you can you
[1:25:12] visit us? Amen. in this in in in the
[1:25:14] island and I could not recognize
[1:25:18] and said, "Excuse me, I'm sorry, but uh
[1:25:22] who are you? When was the last time we
[1:25:24] met?" Amen.
[1:25:28] And and and he said, "You visited us,
[1:25:32] you know, you you you know, in in
[1:25:34] sometime in 2018, you've been you've
[1:25:36] been in this, you know, I've been in
[1:25:38] that island. It's called RMLON conducted
[1:25:42] 2018 and at that time uh I had the
[1:25:45] strong feeling that there were ministers
[1:25:48] that are very interested but they belong
[1:25:50] to a very uh uh uh prominent
[1:25:53] denomination and uh under a certain
[1:25:56] influential
[1:25:58] uh uh bishop of some sort. Amen. And so
[1:26:01] I was prevented from coming back. But
[1:26:03] here comes a message
[1:26:06] uh that they said during the pandemic.
[1:26:10] That was 2018
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; and 2025 already. That's why I forgot.
[1:26:17] Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; I may be getting old.
[1:26:21] I remember you know it's good to
[1:26:23] remember 2003 I came first to Indonesia
[1:26:28] and it's been 22 years. It's good to
[1:26:30] hear but on the other side you realize I
[1:26:33] am 22 years older.
[1:26:37] [Laughter]
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But you see now here
[1:26:41] comes a call once again. Can you visit
[1:26:44] us? And they said they're already
[1:26:47] willing because uh they stream some of
[1:26:50] our services and now they're willing to
[1:26:52] go out of the denomination.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] And when I go home, Amen. We have a
[1:27:01] church affair in October. And then last
[1:27:02] part of October, I'm scheduled to go to
[1:27:04] Indonesia. And then uh uh uh uh uh
[1:27:08] November go back to South Korea because
[1:27:11] I have constant communication with the
[1:27:13] pastor over there uh uh from the
[1:27:15] denomination also. And so I have lineup.
[1:27:19] I'm still here.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; But you know, these are souls.
[1:27:25] Yes.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And so without even thinking because
[1:27:29] we're after these souls,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; we are ready, you know, to come out of
[1:27:34] the denomination. And I committed
[1:27:36] already, okay, let's do it before the
[1:27:39] end of the year. I will be there.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Concerned.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We enjoy the message.
[1:27:49] We enjoy the deep revelation of the
[1:27:52] word. Our faith is being steered.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we must be overflowing with
[1:28:00] joy
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; so that others will benefit from it.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; We drink. Amen. Come that who that is
[1:28:09] thirsty come.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you drink then you are
[1:28:14] able to provide drink as well.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; That's the bride.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. It doesn't stop
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; in us. We need to take it to somebody
[1:28:24] else. Brother said that is being
[1:28:26] convinced and concerned.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So while we are studying
[1:28:31] students, young people, Amen. we're
[1:28:33] working, Amen. we're doing some kind of
[1:28:36] business. Amen. Our main focus still,
[1:28:40] Amen. If our focus is just to get rich
[1:28:44] here on earth, we're missing the point.
[1:28:46] Yes,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; there are still, it's Banham said, and
[1:28:49] I'm not tired of saying this over and
[1:28:51] over again. It's not fair that we're
[1:28:54] enjoying this message so much or hearing
[1:28:57] this message quite a number of times.
[1:29:00] But there are people out there that have
[1:29:01] not heard this message, not a single
[1:29:04] time.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; We have to do something. Thank God
[1:29:09] you're doing something. And I thank God.
[1:29:11] I thank God you're doing your portion.
[1:29:14] Amen. So he come. Now what happened
[1:29:16] because of that simple statement? Oh,
[1:29:19] brother Brennham, that's nothing but the
[1:29:20] truth. Amen. And there he said, "And
[1:29:22] those little modern teenage nickel
[1:29:24] preach boys that had hated the very
[1:29:26] cause of Christ grab one another and
[1:29:28] begin to scream the blessings of God.
[1:29:31] The power of God struck that place.
[1:29:33] Banks fell into his plate. I don't know
[1:29:35] what happened for about 10 minutes. The
[1:29:38] presence of God was so abundant."
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] two young souls at that time never knew
[1:29:46] nothing about it.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were just playing right
[1:29:51] there in the back in in in the in in the
[1:29:53] parking lot. They were not actually in
[1:29:56] the meeting. But the presence of God,
[1:30:00] Amen. Hallelujah. Strapped them and the
[1:30:02] voice of that mother was heard.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Starting from saying the
[1:30:08] right thing.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And spoke the right thing. He had
[1:30:12] the right choice.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want the salvation of my two
[1:30:17] sons. Amen. The presence of God moved
[1:30:19] and there was so much presence. Amen. In
[1:30:22] that congregation and then the presence
[1:30:24] of God. Amen. The presence of God. Amen.
[1:30:27] And then it went to the parking lot.
[1:30:29] Amen. And reach out for those two boys
[1:30:31] who knew nothing about it. He knew
[1:30:33] nothing what their mother spoke.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; But the presence of God pulled them.
[1:30:40] Yes.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And said they walk, Amen. in
[1:30:43] the middle and they were raising their
[1:30:45] hand. And those two little modern
[1:30:46] teenage sneak preach boys that had hated
[1:30:49] the very cause of Christ grabbed one
[1:30:51] another and begin to scream the
[1:30:52] blessings of God. The power of God
[1:30:54] struck that place. Banks fell into his
[1:30:56] plate. Amen. I don't know what happened
[1:30:59] for about 10 minutes. Glory to God.
[1:31:01] Amen. Friends, do you realize what that
[1:31:03] was?
[1:31:05] I have never in all my life had felt
[1:31:08] such anointing.
[1:31:10] Never before.
[1:31:13] Amen. Brother said, I have never felt
[1:31:16] such an anointing. The first time,
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; my
[1:31:22] the first time it was ever performed on
[1:31:26] a human being, it bypass aristocrats.
[1:31:29] bypassed everything else and went to a
[1:31:31] poor little with the woman living up on
[1:31:33] hill there. Hallelujah. It never
[1:31:36] happened before.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Even the prophet said first time it
[1:31:42] happened.
[1:31:44] First time I felt such kind of an
[1:31:46] anointing. Where did it start?
[1:31:50] From a simple mother speaking the right
[1:31:53] thing.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:59] Amen. We have some some opportunities.
[1:32:03] Hallelujah. Amen. I I we just pray that
[1:32:07] when the opportunity comes. Amen. But
[1:32:10] Bible said God knew what you would ask.
[1:32:12] God knew what you would ask.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; And you know when God knew what you will
[1:32:17] ask and your mind goes with the mind of
[1:32:20] God.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; God entrusts us with thus sayeth the
[1:32:25] Lord.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And that's the main
[1:32:28] thing. God knew what she would ask. Her
[1:32:30] two boys were gloriously saved the very
[1:32:32] minute it was spoken. If she would have
[1:32:34] asked for a $1,000, it would have been
[1:32:37] given to her. If she would have asked
[1:32:39] for her sister's healing, it would have
[1:32:40] been given to her. Anything that she
[1:32:42] would ask. Amen. It would have been
[1:32:45] given to her.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; But thank God she asked for the right
[1:32:50] thing.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; May we ask the right thing this morning.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. something that is valuable,
[1:32:57] something that is eternal. May we do
[1:33:00] something for God's glory. Amen. I I
[1:33:03] call this verse 7 to 11, the bride as a
[1:33:07] game changer.
[1:33:08] [Laughter]
[1:33:10] Amen. You know why? Because it never
[1:33:13] happened before.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:18] We have come into the age of first time.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:33:24] things that have not never happened
[1:33:26] before. Things that have never been
[1:33:28] witnessed before
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; but because of the presence of the
[1:33:32] bride. Hallelujah. Who has thus said the
[1:33:35] Lord because of the presence of the
[1:33:37] bride who knows her position what she is
[1:33:40] standing for.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are many things that have
[1:33:44] that are happening right now that are
[1:33:47] happening in this generation for the
[1:33:50] very first time.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Look in verse 11
[1:33:56] is verse seven. The daughters of Cilopia
[1:33:58] speak right. Thou shalt surely give them
[1:34:01] a possession of an inheritance among
[1:34:03] their father's brethren. And thou shalt
[1:34:04] cause the inheritance of their father.
[1:34:07] Amen. To pass unto them.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the first time that
[1:34:15] women
[1:34:17] receive direct inheritance.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; First time. Amen.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Because they stood
[1:34:27] their ground.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes, you know, we
[1:34:30] think, you know, uh uh uh uh we're in
[1:34:33] the market, we're in the public place.
[1:34:35] Amen. Sometimes we're being trapped of
[1:34:37] something. Amen. And and then and and uh
[1:34:40] uh but because we know where we are
[1:34:42] standing, we know how to speak. We know
[1:34:44] how how we stand. Amen. Things happen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember uh uh uh one sister in
[1:34:51] the church. It's it it happened long
[1:34:52] time uh ago and I I was doing uh uh a
[1:34:56] Bible study in an office. Amen. And and
[1:34:59] and uh there's there's a brother in our
[1:35:01] congregation
[1:35:03] uh that witness in the office and maybe
[1:35:06] those uh uh uh uh employees that he was
[1:35:10] sharing the the message with, you know,
[1:35:12] have have some backgrounds and he come
[1:35:14] up with say let me call my pastor. And
[1:35:17] so they arranged a Bible study. Now the
[1:35:20] the the the place was
[1:35:24] 15 minutes from their office. Amen. It's
[1:35:28] in a Jollibee.
[1:35:30] Yeah, brother John know what Jollibee
[1:35:32] is. Amen. So it's it's it's a one of the
[1:35:36] food chains in the Philippines. So it's
[1:35:38] just 15 minutes walk from their office,
[1:35:42] but it is 1 hour and a half from our
[1:35:45] home.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I have to drive to hit that
[1:35:50] break time between 12 and 1. Amen. And
[1:35:55] uh 12:15 they will be there. We will
[1:35:57] have some burger. Amen. Of course, our
[1:36:01] burger is not as good as your burgers
[1:36:03] here. Amen. Our burgers are big in the
[1:36:07] picture, photogenic, but they're small
[1:36:10] in reality. Amen. But here every time if
[1:36:14] my wife is with me, we just order one
[1:36:16] and we share it. Otherwise, when I order
[1:36:19] one, it box follows it immediately.
[1:36:23] Amen. So that's the way. So I travel
[1:36:25] hour and a half, but they travel 15
[1:36:26] minutes and they get there and then we
[1:36:28] do Bible study 30 minutes. Amen. And so
[1:36:32] then we do study, Bible study and it
[1:36:34] happened you know probably about two
[1:36:37] months and then we come up to a certain
[1:36:40] and and one of the sisters she always
[1:36:43] wear pants. Amen. She always wear wear
[1:36:46] pants and she he she has this bandana
[1:36:48] and it look like
[1:36:51] uh a male you know the first time but
[1:36:54] but then and she is very you know she's
[1:36:58] asking questions
[1:37:00] and then we come up with the point and
[1:37:02] and she said last time that she said
[1:37:05] pastor Danny uh
[1:37:10] the the the the the baptism is
[1:37:13] periscriptural
[1:37:15] But you see, I see the believers,
[1:37:19] they wear skirts, but I cannot. It's
[1:37:22] been me all along. But but I said, you
[1:37:25] just believe.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; It's not your problem. It's not even my
[1:37:30] problem.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; You just believe. If you believe this
[1:37:32] word, this portion of the word that you
[1:37:34] believe, Amen. Believe and do it.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; And she did. So he said, "Okay, it's
[1:37:41] okay. So next Sunday I will attend your
[1:37:44] church. His name her name is Ruby. Amen.
[1:37:46] But you see and then uh uh she attended
[1:37:51] and I was surprised she was wearing
[1:37:54] skirt.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; And he got baptized and uh she said and
[1:38:00] so since then
[1:38:03] she never wore pants again.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know because she was close
[1:38:09] to the manager to the owner actually of
[1:38:12] the of the of the business she was
[1:38:15] working with and then the blessing did
[1:38:17] not stop to her.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; She proposed
[1:38:23] to the to the employer why don't we why
[1:38:27] don't we uh make this a uh a proposal
[1:38:31] that women in our office wear skirts.
[1:38:36] Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And there's another employee. Amen. And
[1:38:40] they say, you know, you know, we are
[1:38:42] friends. You know, we're friends. But
[1:38:44] how come, you know, because uh she she
[1:38:47] had kind of an eczema or something. And
[1:38:50] then they they kept on. And so they
[1:38:53] prayed. And so that friend attended the
[1:38:56] attended the Bible study also
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; and she also baptized. She got also
[1:39:01] baptized.
[1:39:03] And then this sister, her name is Sister
[1:39:06] Jane. She testified to her family.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And her family, they hosted a
[1:39:13] Bible study. We got there, the father
[1:39:15] got baptized, the mother got baptized,
[1:39:17] and all the siblings got baptized.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; So the blessing was being passed on
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; from one soul to another to the family,
[1:39:25] so forth and so on.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know the good news, none
[1:39:30] none of them attend my church.
[1:39:34] Because sister Ruby and his family is
[1:39:36] close to brother Netor, they go there.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the other families, Amen.
[1:39:42] They are closer to uh uh brother Dennis
[1:39:45] Credto who is also a product of Mystery
[1:39:47] Expo. They go there.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing remained. I just labored.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; They they benefit.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; But we're all working
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; for the glory of the Lord
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; because this is not our people. This is
[1:40:02] God's people.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The most important thing is for
[1:40:05] them to receive the word, to receive the
[1:40:08] message of the hour and let the word do
[1:40:10] something for them.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But my point is, Hallelujah.
[1:40:15] The blessing does not stop to us. I was
[1:40:18] the first one who received this message
[1:40:20] in my family. Amen. And and and and my
[1:40:23] my my mother and my two uncles and then
[1:40:25] my my two aunties. Amen. Now my my my my
[1:40:28] my cousins and then my n my nieces and
[1:40:30] nephews, they're coming to the church. I
[1:40:32] was the first one.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So remember this blessing.
[1:40:39] And this is what I'm trying to tell you.
[1:40:41] Amen. The inheritance. Amen. Were passed
[1:40:44] on to their to the to the daughters of
[1:40:48] Celopia, the firstborn.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It never happened before.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; But now it happened. And now he said, he
[1:40:56] said, "Now, Amen. Uh uh, thou shalt
[1:40:59] surely give them a possession of an
[1:41:00] inheritance among their father's
[1:41:02] brethren, and thou shalt cause the
[1:41:03] inheritance of their father to pass unto
[1:41:06] them. And thou shalt speak unto the
[1:41:08] children of Israel, saying, If a man die
[1:41:12] and have no son, then ye shall cause his
[1:41:15] inheritance to pass unto his daughter."
[1:41:17] It became a mandate.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; It became a declaration.
[1:41:23] Not only to the daughters of Zilopihad,
[1:41:27] but in generations to come.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the same situation
[1:41:32] happens, you don't have to ask me,
[1:41:35] Moses. Hallelujah. The generations after
[1:41:38] you don't have to ask. Amen. It's
[1:41:40] already a mandate. It must be a law. It
[1:41:43] must be something that must be
[1:41:44] implemented all throughout.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just because of these five
[1:41:50] daughters of Cilopia who stood their
[1:41:52] ground.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Just because there is one mother who
[1:41:55] spoke the right thing.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The benefit was being passed
[1:42:00] on to the generations. It became a
[1:42:03] declaration.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; It is something that you have to recon
[1:42:07] with. It is something that you can refer
[1:42:09] to. One time it happened, it will happen
[1:42:12] again. Hallelujah. Brother Brenham said
[1:42:15] if God bless the person. Amen. Because
[1:42:18] he meets some kind of a standard. If God
[1:42:21] respond to that person and somebody
[1:42:24] Amen. meets the same standard, God is
[1:42:27] obligated
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; to respond to that call.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; The same thing.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now in verse 9, and if he
[1:42:36] have no daughter, then shall you give
[1:42:38] his inheritance unto his brethren. And
[1:42:40] 10, and if he has no brethren, then you
[1:42:42] shall give his inheritance unto his
[1:42:44] father's brethren. And if his father
[1:42:45] have no brethren, then he shall give his
[1:42:47] inheritance unto his kinsmen that is
[1:42:49] next to him of his family, and he shall
[1:42:52] possess it, and he shall be unto the
[1:42:54] children of Israel, statute of judgment,
[1:42:56] as the Lord commanded Moses. Glory to
[1:42:58] God. Amen. So it became a decree. Amen.
[1:43:03] Again, it never happened before. And
[1:43:05] then in the continuation in chapter 36,
[1:43:08] it was quoted and they said, "The Lord
[1:43:10] commanded my Lord to give the land for
[1:43:13] an inheritance by lot to the children of
[1:43:15] Israel. And my Lord was commanded by the
[1:43:19] Lord to give the inheritance of Cilopia,
[1:43:21] our brother, unto his daughters." Now it
[1:43:25] is being quoted.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; It's being a reference already.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. in numbers. And not only that,
[1:43:33] even Joshua, they were already in the
[1:43:36] promised land.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:39] They were already in the promised land.
[1:43:42] And Joshua referred to the same thing.
[1:43:44] But Celopia had the son of Epher, the
[1:43:47] son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son
[1:43:50] of Manasseh, and no sons, but daughters.
[1:43:52] And these are the names of his
[1:43:53] daughters. Malan, Noah, Glamila, and Ta.
[1:43:56] Amen. So it happened. It continue on.
[1:44:00] Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; So the bride is a game changer.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; If you know who we are.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; What we are standing for.

[1:45:38] sphere.

[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Don't we experience squeeze now? Yes,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; we do.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The mystery exposition that we
[1:45:56] were doing before, before it's easy to
[1:45:58] coordinate, it's easy to arrange. But

[1:46:03] have learned so much about the end time
[1:46:05] message, about the name uh uh brother
[1:46:08] William Marian Brham. Amen. It's not
[1:46:10] that easy.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The denominations are also closing

[1:46:17] gleaning time.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; We're being squeezed. were being pushed
[1:46:21] into one corner.

[1:46:37] mountain be moved.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we believe that. Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Maybe you speak
[1:46:44] that mountain to be moved and maybe the
[1:46:47] the big mountain is still there, but
[1:46:50] because you speak,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; you don't realize it. You don't see it
[1:46:53] in your naked eye, but there is already
[1:46:56] a small stone that rule already
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; when you spoke."
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes there are things that we
[1:47:03] want to happen in our families,
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; in our children.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We claim our children said you
[1:47:11] applied the token.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's our the place of
[1:47:15] safety.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. In your naked eye some it might be
[1:47:20] nothing is happening but because you
[1:47:23] believe God

[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't see it but
[1:47:30] something is already moving in their
[1:47:33] hearts.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe your family, maybe your neighbors.

[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Just believe.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; We're in that realm already.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're there. Amen. So that's why
[1:47:50] he said when the Methodist failed, God
[1:47:51] raised up others. And so it has gone on
[1:47:53] through the years until in this last day
[1:47:56] there is again another people in the
[1:47:58] land who under their messenger will be
[1:48:01] the final voice to this final age.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You love him this
[1:48:08] morning.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Because he first loved us.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Few more slides here. Now see
[1:48:17] here.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Uh I say this, we go back to verse one.
[1:48:24] I say this bonus.
[1:48:27] I'm done with my main menu.
[1:48:33] Amen. So this is now the what you call
[1:48:36] that
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; dessert. The dessert. Amen. Numbers
[1:48:41] 27:E1.
[1:48:42] Then came the daughters of Zilopiad.
[1:48:45] Amen. Zilopihad the son of Heer
[1:48:49] means well the youngest son of Gilead
[1:48:52] and then Father the son of Makir elder
[1:48:56] son of Manasse and Manasse eldest son of
[1:48:58] Joseph and then Joseph.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. So see the lineage the lineage of
[1:49:03] zilopiad is zilopiader gilead makir
[1:49:08] manasse Joseph that's the lineage right
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; now we know that Joseph had two sons the
[1:49:17] other one was Ephraim
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:49:20] by birth
[1:49:23] is the elder
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; he had the birthright supposedly
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; in the eyes of Joseph Yeah.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; So that was in the eyes of Joseph. Now
[1:49:35] it never happened before.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; It never happened before because all the
[1:49:41] while Amen. Uh all the benefits go to
[1:49:44] the
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; elder to the eldest the birthright.
[1:49:51] Amen. But this time listen so in the
[1:49:54] mind of Joseph Ephraim was the first
[1:49:59] Manasseh was the second. So when when
[1:50:01] when he requested blessing from his
[1:50:05] father who was old and his eyes were
[1:50:08] dimmed.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he placed Ephraim on the right
[1:50:13] side of uh of Jacob of Israel and
[1:50:16] Manasseh on the left.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And so now when when when when Israel
[1:50:23] was about to give the blessing,
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. he crossed
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; his arm.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Joseph jumped and said, "Wait
[1:50:33] a minute. Wait a minute, father. That's
[1:50:34] not the way it should be."
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he tried to correct the
[1:50:38] prophet.
[1:50:41] That's not the way it should be. Amen.
[1:50:43] This is This should be Your right hand
[1:50:45] should be on A-frame. Amen. I know
[1:50:48] that's Abraham. Amen. But it's not me.
[1:50:52] But God crossed my hand.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; And the blessing went to Manasse.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so where is the lineage of
[1:51:01] Zilopiad? Manasse to the younger.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had greater blessings. So
[1:51:08] that's the same thing with Israel and
[1:51:10] the bride. Amen. Because of the cross,
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; the blessing went to the bride and we
[1:51:18] are enjoying that. We belong to that
[1:51:21] lineage. Hallelujah. Amen. We became the
[1:51:25] daughters.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the firstborn. Glory to God.
[1:51:30] Amen. You love him this morning. Amen.
[1:51:32] So that's your bonus. That's your
[1:51:33] dessert. Amen. But let me tell you
[1:51:36] something this morning as I call on our
[1:51:37] precious brother. Amen. And the
[1:51:39] musicians, please. Amen. So listen
[1:51:42] there's one thing that I want to leave
[1:51:44] on you. Amen. You know
[1:51:49] the basis of the daughters of Zilopead
[1:51:53] was our father did not rebel against the
[1:51:59] prophet.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Many things going on. Hallelujah. But
[1:52:04] there's one thing the bride hallelujah
[1:52:07] claims today. There's one thing that is
[1:52:10] the basis of our claim of our
[1:52:13] inheritance because we have a father
[1:52:18] because we have a prophet in this
[1:52:21] generation that have begotten us.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Like Paul through this gospel and and he
[1:52:28] said I have never been
[1:52:31] amened
[1:52:35] to the heavenly vision.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He said, "Will Paul be
[1:52:40] presenting his people also?"
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Will will Paul present Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And he had that confidence. Well, I
[1:52:52] preached what Paul preached.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, we have that kind of
[1:52:57] confidence.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Because our prophet did not revel
[1:53:01] against the word of God. He became
[1:53:04] obedient to the word until his final
[1:53:06] life. Amen.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Final stage of this life.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Literally, fathers and mothers, this is
[1:53:12] something we can leave to our children.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; For them to witness
[1:53:18] that we have never been a rebel
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; to this message to our pastor, to our
[1:53:25] church.
[1:53:26] Young people, you may say, "I'm blessed.
[1:53:29] I finished my studies. I'm blessed with
[1:53:32] good job." Remember,
[1:53:35] it's because you have parents who stood
[1:53:37] their ground
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; to this message. They have never been a
[1:53:41] rebel.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; They stood with the prophet.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; That's why you're enjoying all these
[1:53:48] blessings. Glory to God. Let's all stand
[1:53:51] up and praise him.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You daughters of the firstborn.
[1:53:58] Amen. It's time to claim our
[1:54:01] inheritance.
[1:54:02] It's here. Thank you, Lord. Let me leave
[1:54:05] you with some kind of prayer this
[1:54:06] morning. Dear heavenly father,
[1:54:11] we are completely committed, Lord.

[2:02:06] had no peace within. Till I heard how
[2:02:09] Jesus died up on the tree.
[2:02:13] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[2:02:16] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter

[2:04:16] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[2:04:19] the narrow way. For the comforter abides
[2:04:23] with me.
[2:04:26] I thirsted in a barren land of sin and
[2:04:30] shame and nothing satisfying there I
[2:04:34] found.
[2:04:36] But to the blessed cross of Christ, one
[2:04:39] day I came, where springs of living
[2:04:43] water did abound.
[2:04:46] Now I'm drinking at the springs of
[2:04:49] living water.
[2:04:52] Happy now am I. My soul is satisfied.
[2:04:57] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[2:05:02] Wonderful and bountiful supply.
[2:05:06] How sweet the living water from the
[2:05:10] hills of God. It makes me glad and happy
[2:05:14] all the way.
[2:05:17] Now glory, grace, and blessing mark the
[2:05:20] path I've t. I'm shouting hallelujah
[2:05:24] every day.
[2:05:26] Will I'm drinking at the springs of
[2:05:29] living water.
[2:05:32] Happy now am I. My soul they satisfied.
[2:05:37] I'm drinking at the springs of living
[2:05:40] water.
[2:05:42] Oh wonderful and bountiful supply.
[2:05:47] Oh sinner, won't you come today to
[2:05:50] Calary,
[2:05:52] a fountain there is open deep and wide.
[2:05:57] The Savior now invites you to the water
[2:06:01] free where thirsting spirits can be
[2:06:04] satisfied.
[2:06:06] Oh, I'm drinking at the springs of
[2:06:09] living water.
[2:06:12] Happy now am I. My soul is satisfied.
[2:06:17] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[2:06:22] Wonderful and bountiful supply.
[2:06:27] How sweet the living water from the
[2:06:30] hills of God. It makes me glad and happy
[2:06:34] all the way.
[2:06:37] Now glory, grace, and blessing mark the
[2:06:40] path I've tried. I'm shouting hallelujah
[2:06:44] every day. Well, I'm drinking at the
[2:06:48] springs of living water.
[2:06:52] [Music]
[2:06:54] Oh my soul may satisfy
[2:06:57] drinking at the springs of living water.
[2:07:02] Oh wonderful and bountiful supply. Oh
[2:07:06] wonderful, oh wonderful and bountiful
[2:07:10] supply.
