my heart was distressed me jehovah's red frown going low in the bit where my sins drag me down there i cry to the lord from the deep my replays oh [Music] hallelujah [Applause] here i remain stand by

the mirror [Music] hallelujah i'll praise him to all and his mercy shall see i'll sing out salvation at home and abroad [Applause] he set my feet on a rock to stay and he put a song with its gloom and despair i'll praise the dear father who answered my prayer i'll sing my new song with a glad story of love then join in the chorus [Music] oh he brought me out of the murray place [Music] amen

gracious heavenly father how that sends joy bells in our hearts to think that a great almighty or powerful omnipotent god holding the universe in the palm of his hand and you care about us lord reading in your word last night to my daughters i read there in psalms where david stood amazed he said the thought your thoughts towards me and more than the grains of sand upon the seashore he said i cannot i can't handle this david was in shock and in awe and lord to think that the same god that thought that about david thinks that about us lord we're on your mind how that just makes us feel lord let the world fall apart let the world go insane the lord you're we are on your minds we are in your heart lord you've never taken your eyes off of us you know right where we are you know right where we're going you know like david said if i make my my bed in hell thou art there lord you know where we go you go with us lord we so appreciate that lord i appreciate those that have gathered tonight lord and lord i just pray that you would be blessed lord would your people be helped lord may all things and be said and done tonight for your honor and for your glory lord you know what we have need of lord you know just the right vitamin the right word lord to give us strength to the journeys ahead and so that we can fulfill this great mystery lord that you hid in these earthen vessels lord we just ask that your presence would just be with us now in jesus name amen amen while you're standing i'll have you take your bibles it's so good to be with you tonight see y'all see your faces and uh so i hope we just can have fellowship around the world tonight is that okay you know it's almost it's so much more fun if we're sitting around the kitchen table we're drinking a cup of coffee and just having fellowship with each other you know because i can speak and then you can give me some feedback and all that kind of stuff and so but tonight we're just having a fellowship there's no form in our fashion we're just people that by god's grace he chose he elected he called out and now he he redeemed us by his hand and now he holds us by his hand and he guides us by that same hand so let's just turn to him he's the only one in this life's journey that we can have confidence in so i like to i i'm trying to think if i have any announcements i don't think i do so we'll just go right to the word i think brother chad's okay i hope he's i hope he is i'm sorry it's just i'm already yeah so now brother ben right you don't make me forget about them announcements i just completely failed brother brother chad's okay right sister angie he's fine he'll be here on friday lord willing sorry and we're all looking forward to our pastor and brother elia coming back i've heard good things so if you don't mind let's just let's just continue i'd like you to turn your bibles to exodus 33 7. exodus 33 7. um and i heard you've been standing for a while so i'll let you sit in a minute a little lengthy portion here but if you could just enter into this thought with me exodus 33 7 and moses took the temple and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that everyone that sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle that the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou has said i know thee by name and thou hast also found and also found grace in my sight now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in your sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i might find grace in thy sight and consider his name and consider this nation is thy people and he said my presence will go with thee and i will give you rest you may be seated a bit of a lengthy reading i kind of stumbled across it and it really struck me how how god moses didn't know who was going to go with him and god had to remind him i want to go with you moses i'd like to be the one the bible says i think there's a scripture it says you know where where is the place of my dwelling but a body has thou prepared for me right god was looking for a place of rest and so are we and i there's a lot in this and i kept praying about it and i wanted to go some ways with this and i just seemingly can't could not i kept getting a blocked door but i kept getting one strong thing and so i'm i don't believe i'm prone to fanaticism by any means but i do believe sons of god are led by the spirit of god i think if we remove inspiration and holy ghost leadership from the church of the living god we just have a lot of formally educated individuals and we uh separate ourselves from the supernatural then there's something wrong with us each and every one of us but i have a direction and i'm nervous because that's all he gave me and i stared at this computer for hours and i just know i have a direction and i feel as confident as i've ever felt confident in my life that this is a direction he gave me a scripture now beyond that i have no idea is that okay so i'd like you to turn to matthews 11 verse 28. and before we read it i was praying and i don't think a minister i don't think anybody that loves the lord and loves god's people as they mature in the lord do they ever really do they come to a point where they really care of impressing anybody i don't think impressing anybody is really an attribute of a holy ghost-filled man or woman if the greatest among us made of himself of no reputation his ministry continues in the bride of jesus christ i believe a non-reputation type wife is what he will find and so when i come to speak and you all know me enough by now and you know what i love following brother noel because we all know brother noel is brother noel and we love that about him i love that about him i told him i said brother no you carried just the right vitamin for me brother i can be just what i am by the grace of god i can't be nothing that i hate we don't have to imitate we don't have to be like anybody else i think it was choice stones and each one is unique and they all have their place and nobody fills that gap but that stone no matter how strangely cut they are and i love brother noel he can let you relax in your skin and so coming here tonight i just felt probably way more relaxed than i should because i just was so encouraged by his ministry and i and i told him i said i just so love a five-fold ministry i appreciate a five-fold ministry in this day and this hour when so many people don't want a five-fold ministry here i am standing over here and i love it i love how god can take a simple man who makes mistakes and can be honest about it who's fallible but yet god can still use that man to speak words of eternal life and he does it over and over it's a true paradox that god hid himself right in the paradox that this man can make mistakes and yet it's every bit god when he speaks and he can still make mistakes it doesn't mean everything he says is right sometimes a man may say something wrong but you watch the attributes of a man he can come back and be a real holy ghost-filled man and make it right if you question me on that you haven't listened to the prophet of god brother branham said god corrected me i shouldn't have been calling them rickies and raketas he said god stop me i was calling out a man's name he said i never should have done it he just checked me i did wrong so the holy ghost filled men make mistakes oh yeah sure they do but because they're holy ghost-filled men they go make it right they make things right and so it's just so interesting and i so love to see that wave sheet that's when waved before me it lets me relax and it helps me be just what god made me and so when i talked to brother no i got a chance to go over to brother jeremy's and talk to him for a little bit and he just you light up in his presence because i told him i said brother i love it a mature ministry and a mature people can say you know what brother noel you brought vitamin a today and that's what i needed brother chad will bring vitamin c brother ben vitamin b brother kyle vitamin k you know and there's enough maturity in each of us and in you to realize there's nothing wrong he didn't have to carry vitamin a he didn't have to carry vitamin b he could just carry the vitamin he needed to carry because the sheep needed that vitamin that's just what they needed it was the right thing it was the right word said in the right way and only he could say it just that way and so as time goes on i think the ideas of one great big man get very little and realizing that the ministry of god spread forth through a five-fold ministry of diverse characters becomes something of a very precious thing in our sight and even sometimes the most calmly pieces and the most of rejected ones seem to sometimes do so much very so much for you as time goes on and so i just got way off subject so i oh like i told you i had this direction and so i'm like lord you've given me this direction you've given me this scripture and if i told you how much he vindicated for this to me you really truly would think i was a fanatic but even it got to the point my wife said oh my goodness look it's here too like she was noticing i had shared with her this scripture and it was everywhere like everywhere it's at the point like like okay i'll give you a little sign of it you can just really think i'm a fanatic because i don't mind um brother man you ever pray and say lord if you just give me a sign what direction to go i'll go i'll go you ever prayed like that lord if i just knew just show me write it in the skies are you ready i was praying for this service i was praying for you and i tried to explain it to my daughters it's it's something strange you know we all have our own ways i guess are preparing i get to thinking about you it's weird because brother branham said if you don't care for the people you can never help them and so you get to like you get a feeling for you and i'm probably letting letting you in on something i don't know what i should tell you but just for me no one's ever told me this but it's just something i realized and i notice it with the youth too i get to getting a feeling for the youth it's like i have to um get out of my own way for a moment and then i get to thinking about y'all different faces come in my mind and that's how i begin when i get to try to relax myself and get out of the way and you and i start thinking about the congregation and i start thinking about the young people and the old people and the married people and the single people and i get to thinking about you and it helps me relax and that sometimes it just gets you to your point you get to you get to feeling like now i can i can intercede for them i can go to the lord for them because i can feel what they're feeling that may make no sense to anybody i'm sorry i probably shouldn't even have told you that but it starts with me having to have a feeling for y'all before i feel like i can help you and then it helps me relax and then as i relax i start to say lord what what what would you want me to say i don't know you know it's not like a minister has like got all these sermons ready to go he's like hey i'm firing this one off you know it's like you could give me two years to prepare and i promise you i will have no idea what to say even probably when i'm standing there like now it it doesn't matter for me you know i don't have the gifts that other brothers could have like give me a preach on this subject man they go like i can't even remember what i'm going to say even after i study a subject usually i told my wife when inspiration is there i can go for hours and after it's gone i couldn't tell you my middle name sometimes strange how that works that's just a reality am i helping you be more comfortable in your skin for a moment and so uh as i began to think that through that scripture come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me i'm meek and lowly in heart and that ye shall find rest for your souls so that scripture kept coming to my mind as i'm starting to prepare on saturday morning and you know i'm like lord well i don't know wish i knew what direction i'm thinking of that scripture and i look up and on a billboard is written come unto me all you that are weary heavy laden i'll give you rest and i'm like wow you know that's obvious that's too obvious no way god would work that way right that's too easy because then if i look for this all the time i'll be looking for every billboard in lineman saying what's the scripture verse i'm gonna preach on next week you know but you know it doesn't work that way you know it really doesn't but before god he knows he'll i'll answer on the day of judgment he knows that that scripture was on my mind i look up there's the scripture and i'm like wow that's odd then i come back here and i'm talking to brother noel and brother noel right before service just to check on him and he's sitting there and he goes you know he said lord change my subject he said i was driving saturday morning same time i was driving and he said inspiration came over and i told says surely grab a pen i'm going to start telling you what to write because he had to drive all day i think and he didn't have time to prepare he said i had a whole sermon prepared and i can't preach it inspiration take me a different direction and he said i want i want to speak on the believer's position in christ and how it brings a rest and and he said i learned some things in habit cook about faith and i want to talk about it i said well praise god brother i said kind of odd it's kind of i think the direction i'm supposed to be going for wednesday night and then we go home we're reading a story to my my daughters and we start reading this random story that we just picked up to read calm the girls down put them to bed and i'm barely listening because it's not really good but anyhow you know the kids like the story and carrie stopped she's like you ain't going to believe this it says in the story come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden i'll give you rest right kerry i mean to the point where like it's too obvious way too obvious right and so that's what i feel and so you know when times gone past men would come by inspiration and preach the word and i began to stop and think you know jesus dispatched them two by two he said take no thought for what you're going to say and take no purse don't prepare for this you just rely upon me and then i began to realize you know god has always wanted a people that just relied upon him there has never been a time that you could look through the scriptures and find those heroes of faith that did not have to live their life in a position where their place of rest was in his presence you will never find it i can't find it and then once i began to think about it i realized wow okay let's go back to genesis here's cain's people and then here's seth's humble little group god's people seth's people chosen occupation farmers and herdsmen this occupational choice that was before them made them be reliant upon god for everything that they had need of in this life's journey everything never has there been a position where god will so gift you or so it in um i give you revelation or ever get you to a point where you don't need him i mean that's counteractive to his nature and his desire he never wanted that kind of a people like what kind of a husband wants a wife that says i truly have no need of you like stay here i like the house keep working but i really don't need you that's not the wife that god ever desired it's not the wife that he wants he wants a wife that loves him depends upon him trusts him says lord you said that i believe you'll do it so look at abraham god gives abraham a promise and god he got older but he didn't stagger at the promise because god had a hero of faith here this man's faith could not be shaken by the circumstances he found himself in and so i began to think this through and began to realize we're living in an hour where everything is falling apart right this doesn't take any spiritual discernment to realize that not one ounce you talk to anybody on the street and they are preparing for something really bad either an economic collapse or a famine or a politically driven craziness of forcing some type of something somewhere brother branham said nations are shaking looking for alliances you can't look at the news where you don't hear about some country that's doing some type of political jockeying at this moment because they're all scared out of their minds i mean shake yourself i should say pinch yourself we have arrived everything is shaking everything is falling apart men's hearts are failing for fear people are having heart attacks left and right they're scared to death they're building bunkers they're preparing for all kinds of things okay now here's god's people what do they do to prepare i mean honestly in all sincerity like i told you i'm just gonna be real honest with you i got a direction i have a leading i know where i'm supposed to go so i just talk to you what do the believers that believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever do in this situation what do they do i tell you what they don't do they don't get afraid they don't make economic moves to protect themselves they don't concern themselves with what politics are going to do they don't talk about it all the time as if that's the thing that's the most important to them in their life there's certain things a believer doesn't do when these things are coming about and i'll tell you they are preppers we do prep don't we we stay in prayer we stay in the word and we walk and conduct ourselves with joy in our hearts knowing oh my our redemption's just getting a little closer my the greatest time that we could ever be alive is approaching us it's coming fast and oh this is wonderful you know what i'm saying but i find that this rapture is the position of the believer and i won't go super far on this because there's a lot i'm chewing on with this but i'm finding a very clear similarity brother benham said that the rapture is a he said this revelation is faith and faith works by love so it's a position that you live in you know enoch just lived in a certain position in the presence of god but so few consider that like i promise you it doesn't really matter that you're a part of this church it doesn't matter that you are part of the right group it doesn't matter that you think the right thoughts that you understand the right doctrine i'm telling you it doesn't but if the presence of god isn't in you and filling your very vessel and guiding you and leading you every day everything you know means nothing it truly means nothing now that word will help you if he's at the center post of your life every word means something and it has its importance and it has its significance but if you haven't been filled with his life which dictates your actions and your decisions in your life then what did it all mean anyhow it meant nothing it was pointless and it wasn't a place of rest you couldn't have a true security in that and you know you can't and you know you don't and so can i read just some scriptures and we'll see what happens next and i i wanted to say i so appreciate a sister earl early this morning sent me a text and said i'm praying for you i felt inspired to let you know god woke me up 4am i've been praying for you and i said i so appreciate holy ghost leadership i so appreciate that someone can just submit themselves to do what they feel to do with not knowing all the reasons why they do it but they just do it and i i think that's kind of a people god wanted didn't he you kind of see a pattern why did he send him out two by two no personal script why did he cause them to go out as sheepherders and and and herdsmen and not think about it right don't worry about it you know it's because they wanted the people to live by faith he wanted a people and a wife that trusted him we didn't want a people that was so concerned about trying to figure everything out so they can manage in a world that's falling apart it's an exercise in futility complete waste and utter waste of time and energy and all it does is express your unbelief and i'm sorry to say that but it's true i ask these questions of myself but we have an american system i mean honestly guys let's think for a moment what about our believers in sudan malawi africa southern africa what do they do to prepare they trust god then i talk to american believers and we've got to talk an economical situation how are we going to make a move how are we going to prepare we should all move to florida they have a good governor right people talk like this that's not believers that's i mean that's not how believers talk i ain't saying you could have a temporary moment of insanity and lose your mind and start acting like the rest of the world but let me spiritually wake you up you've been called and elected of god for this hour this is the greatest of ours we could have ever been on this earth he must have had some choice soldiers that were prepared and ready for this type of an onslaught in this amount and this this time of great fear and and and uh oh boy unbelief he had a people that were fearless shadrach meshach and abednego god liked to put his people right up against the back of a fire he loves to do that he likes it to get so dark it looks like there's no way that this this can work out just to come on the scene just to come on the scene in the darkest of hours so what is it to us why do we concern ourselves with these things i had a man he's not a believer but he called me and he called me this morning i'm like man good timing it caught me like hey should i be buying gold i'm like no who cares i said it's gonna burn he said well maybe yeah yeah yeah i know he says he says yeah yeah yeah he goes maybe i should buy farmland i mean we're going to need to eat i said you're not getting it you're just not getting it my friend i wasn't a believer so you know he's a friend though good friend of mine i said no i'd hi i'd get hidden under the rock that's what i told him i said i just find that hiding place because that's the only thing that i know ain't gonna be shaken and so you know these things and that's why i said i says all i know of is that i'm supposed to say come unto me all ye that are weary heavy laden and he'll give you the rest that you need if you're discouraged if you're concerned if you're laying up at night trying to figure out how you should make a move next let me give you words of comfort your father in heaven and i don't mean to say that to be fanatical but it is the word is saying come unto me and take your rest stop worrying stop concerning stop trying to make moves to prepare he already made all the moves you have nothing you have to do but trust him and if you love him you will trust him and your actions will determine how much you actually do you know what i mean so ii corinthians says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh and so you get to thinking about this you realize there is a life there is a decision and it's not always the easier way that you make it's not always the the more comfortable path that we choose in life but you make certain i had this and i told my wife i said you know honey i says i said to another brother says you ever think about it i said what cross are you picking up like we're americans we complain about the things we shouldn't complain about i mean it's a reproach to us it's really something to overcome because you most don't bear much of a cross let's just be honest we bear very little cross and how can you separate suffering from the christian life and how will you know him so then comes the question would you be willing to make a harder choice for his sake these are questions i ask me would you be willing to take up a cross of your own choosing would you be willing to choose a harder way for the glory of god and for the help to his people you know that's why as i really like i don't know why brother jarriah came and i just thought him and i says i appreciate the sacrifice that brother made to come here early open up everything for you all you probably didn't even know it came here early he has a family he's got kids he made a sacrifice for you all because he loved you come here early get things ready brother franco sister amy what a sacrifice they make trustees i know how hard you work you know so brother john would never want your position it's hot and cold at the same time no matter what the temperature is at all times by the way it's cold in here so but you know what i mean god appreciates these little sacrifices that they all make and we all make for each other but it's such a little thing god appreciates it brother branham said it no matter what you do god appreciates it but i just wonder could we could we make some other harder choices some career choices some family choices some personal choices like you know you're gonna die if god if your body isn't molecules completely changed one day you'll die and you'll have to answer for the life that you've been given and every gift and every decision you made is going to come up before you one of these days and it's not a light thing like don't get me wrong i love to be encouraged and i love to hear how wonderful we are as a people because we are we're his great choosing we're his elect and he's done so very much for us but then sometimes it just seems like what what have i done for him you know we get so consumed with feeling good that we don't consider he wants to take rest too like you see what i i read where is the place of my dwelling where is the place of my rest you know god's looking to take rest where is he going to find a people that he can have rest in have complete and total utter control over every decision that they make where can he find that kind of arrest he doesn't care about this building like i don't care about this building i care about you all but god doesn't care about the metal and the drywall and the carpets and the chairs this is not the place of his dwelling brother brian sorry another tall man brother joe brother for the job that's his interest man if i could just get that tabernacle that's what i want that's the place of my dwelling right but the donovan man i've been working on him for a long time that's what i want i don't want a name i don't want a building i don't want anything like that i was looking for one individual that could be a total sold out surrendered individual oh if i could just get that man right there that's all i was looking for you know that sister boy if i could just get her to realize how precious she is to me don't forget the thoughts of god to you are more than the sand that is upon the sea so i think he's had some thoughts about you i think he's been longing for a very long time and going to great lengths efforts to get you into a position that he could have full preeminences but remember being a perfect gentleman he'll never take him i had this thought where he says speak the truth in love and it struck me the other day i shared it with a brother i said you know god that that mystery that god wanted to have the preeminences in the bride was so precious to him he held on to it for thousands of years and didn't let it out you ever think why brother bam said the devil could do great damage with it if he did so it was so precious to him to hide this mystery that christ in you was his ultimate desire that he hid it and knowing that god wanted the preeminences in his bride realizing that he could never force this decision upon her because he built you with free moral agency you have to make a choice what would happen and i shared i think it was brother wesley a couple brothers if i told you i'm looking for a wife and she better be this tall she better be able to cook this pie she better be able to do this amount of laundry within a four-hour period she better be able to cook she'll be able to clean she better do this she better hug me three times a day send me a text tell me if she loves me tells me all these things right okay now say my wife finds that out and she does all of it because i had a little thread at the bottom because if she don't i will put her away now she could do all those things but is she doing them because she wants to no it's out of fear she's afraid if she doesn't she's out you think god wants a bride that serves him out of fear not at all it doesn't even fit his nature it's contradictory to his nature and so if you don't speak the truth in love but you speak the truth anyhow is it justified no not justified the ends cannot justify the means when it comes to the gospel of jesus christ and so i began to chew on these things i said well now this is an interesting thought what if we do all the right things for all the wrong reasons then if we do all the right things for all the wrong reasons then god's purpose is still not fulfilled in his bride so you could have a dynamic ministry phenomenal ministry that people feel compelled and pressured into conforming to a certain type of life and it's not what god wanted again doing all the right things absolutely all of the wrong reasons and you have spoiled the entire purpose that god had purposed in his heart for his people god wanted preeminence god wanted you to be willing to lay down your life so he could have the preeminences to make every decision for you and that's a shocking thought he's that concerned yep and it's so rare to find so hard to find a people that could be that surrendered to god that the only thing they concern themselves with is doing his will you know brother branham says in conferences he says god called himself to a conference strange way of stating this he said in every way he was a man he thought like a man he felt like a man he had temptations like a man but he was also god and he says and the father asked him will you go to that cross will you make this your decision and he said he wrestled it out in this conference with god and he said i will i'll do it so there in the garden of gethsethme he chose the cross where he laid down his will for the will of the father he said not my will thine will be done and he continued on and so this question i've had of myself should i call myself to a conference because i find in me both good and evil you find in you both very much flesh and yet very much god this is a mystery that's been unveiled to us that we actually can relate with that we know there's a aspect of you that's not god and you know it and i know it but there's very much an aspect of you that is very much and i know it and you know it and that's why i appreciate so much about the various body the various gifts that are in the body because i can recognize and i've had conversations with close brothers that know me very well and they know there's times when that's just kyle talking frustrated down concerned worried and then there's times when god speaks and it it's totally different and then so i find myself have we really come to that time in this omega ministry where god continues to work and to fulfill his great desire and fulfill those things that he left undone for his body to be fulfilled has he put us back in the position of the garden where we're calling ourselves to a conference and saying what cross did i pick up today how can i give him this preeminence how can he take his rest so that i can take mine you know when enoch took the rapture it wasn't like enoch did this all alone he was with somebody he was walking with the lord and he took a rapture you know when brother branham's body changed and he became a young man it wasn't because he was alone he was in the presence of the right person the presence of the right person asked him a question and said you want to walk with me he said lord be the greatest desire of my life right before then he had to make a decision and lord had to reveal to him you walk with too many if you're going to walk with me you walk alone from this point on and so much of us we just don't we know god calls us to those types i could totally i just talked to you like we're sitting at the table right is that okay and we know sometimes god calls us like that he whispers something to us says hey if you're gonna walk with me you gotta give that up you're gonna walk with me you can't keep doing that if you're gonna walk with me you have to separate why do you think moses god had to take or moses had to take the tabernacle outside of the camp to meet with god there comes a point in time where it's you and you only and it's him and him only and that is your place of rest that is his greatest desire and i think that's the rapture i believe that that's the rapture a place of rest a hiding place in him you know what i mean we are in rapture cycle i get it i know to wit the change in the body is the fullness of redemption but i'm looking at this rest and i'm realizing the earnest of my redemption was the holy spirit and the holy spirit guidance is leading me back behind the veil where the curtain can be shut and i'm with him alone then let the world do whatever it's going to do let it blow up let russia drop bombs and let the economies of the world collapse what do i care i've been shut in i'm shut in i'm closed in and it's just joy bells ringing for me because i know the one i put my confidence in he's promised i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you i'll lead you i'll guide you don't you ever worry what do i have to worry about i'm in the palm of his hand so a believer's position in christ this true place of rest he says take my yoke upon you yoke yourself that means join yourself with me but remember i'm meek and i'm lowly you know god will never change in that nature he's not all of a sudden not ever going to be meek we're not going to get to heaven and realize he changes his mask and he's not meek any longer he is and will for always be a meek and gentle lamb that's what makes him so great he's so great he can make himself simple and that's why i think now we're at this point in time the bride has some decisions to make can she become this simple can she become this lowly can she not concern herself with just keeping up for him brother branham said why are the people so tossed about he said the christian faith is solidly based on rest that's it christian is not tossed about a christian doesn't run from place to praise a christian doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a christian's at rest it's all over for him it was all finished for the believer on calvary it's all over he says but i find there's two types of christians he says not types phases he says this he says oh did i just leave it no he says these two types of christians seem strange he said i would say it's really two types or two phases would be a better use of the word not types to phases some christianities two phases to it one of them it's intellectual it's a mental conception of god god of what god has said in his word and of jesus christ by the way of knowledge and the other is experience that god has given the man in his heart the one intellectually he's hungry and feasting on god but his feasts just don't hold out the other one seems to have victory all the time there's nothing that bothers him he's as solid and anchored as there can be no trials and no storms can bother them at all that's the kind of christian i want to be i may not have all the answers and i may not know all the mysteries but i know what god did in my heart and by the grace of god i'm learning obedience through much suffering and i want that experience to continue to grow and grow and i want him to have the preeminence more and more can i continue just sitting around the table let me tell you something when you're worshiping god in spirit and truth when it becomes custom for you to do it because you think you ought to because you think that if i don't shout or don't jump up and down or i don't dance or the neighbor's going to think that i'm backslid then you are drinking from stagnated stream until it fills your every fiber until the holy spirit itself is bubbling in you i don't care whether the music is playing whether they're playing near my god to thee or whatever the holy spirit is still ringing out joy bells in your heart he's still satisfying that god that satisfies the portion anything else but that in your done you might speak with tongues of men and angels you might give all your goods to the poor you might prophesy you might have knowledge and you may understand all the mysteries and all things you have become tinkling you have become nothing you are until that satisfying something can come in there and quench that thirst like he said my soul thirsts for the living god like the heart is panting after the water brook unless i can find it i will perish you will get hungrier for god you will you will get hungry for god something is going to take place the holy spirit will lead you to that great fountain of god obviously to satisfy the thirst right there's just something about god when he comes into the individual he calms you down that was this purpose right when he the spirit of of truth is come when truth is made known and he's speaking to you and you know he's leading you how could you not rest how could you not rest when you see him look back through life and you see the decisions you made and you look how many things he brought you through how do you not rest my he knows the end in the beginning like david could say he knows my goings forth and my comings from he knows if i ascended up into heaven he's there if i go down to hell he's there he's with me david's saying no matter where i go he's with me so david could be at rest and he could write the 27th psalm and the prophet of god to this age could come back and pick it up and say there you go there's your rapture this man has hidden himself cleft behind the rock what does he care if wars and rumors of wars and enemies and everybody rejects him and all manner of evil is surrounding him what does he care he's walking with the king what does it matter he says a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate that this thought is that in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to a people but god sent forth luther with the word and the lutheran spoke for god but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization and an organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple word and they could just no longer speak for god and so you know what dogma means a set of commonly held truths that's all it means a set of commonly held truths is dogma but i certainly hope you're not a believer because you're just walking with commonly held truths i pray and i believe with all my heart that the prophet of god came to fulfill one purpose which he said that was to join god and man again his purpose wasn't to build a church his purpose was not to draw people to himself his purpose was to see to it that god and man could become one again that was the purpose that was the objective that's the purpose of the ministry i think that's the purpose of any believer is they want to see god and man join when you witness to somebody you're not there to impress them with what you know you have a heart for the man you want to see that man get back in his position as a son of god restored to his father that he could walk like like a man that came from a kingdom somewhere else you know what i mean brother branham says this the key to success was dividing and conquering he says now we know that the wounded head of pagan the of the pagan empire this great political world power his head rose up again this roman catholic spiritual empire now watch it carefully what did political pagan rome do that was the basis for her success she divided and conquered that was the seed of rome to divide and conquer now her iron teeth devout tore and devour whom she tore and devoured they could not rise again the same iron teeth remained in her when she arose as the false church her policies have always remained the same divide and conquer this is nicolaitanism and god hates it absolutely utterly hates it what did the devil do in the beginning he came to eve and separated her from the simple word that she had confidence in and when he said brother brown said they only had a few words to keep and when the devil could come in and create in her an insecurity and insecurity to thirst for something than what god had given her he could slip in the trap and so you think we're living in insecure times yeah yeah do you think the devil has given up on trying to trip you up no no no no he'll try to create an insecurity so he can slip in a little lie get you to believe something that draws you away from a simple humble faith in a simple pure word that god never fails and he always keeps his word like i don't know how to make it any more simple come unto me i'll give you rest but you won't do that if you don't believe it but if you do believe it you will and you'll yoke yourself with this simple humble word you'll take an approach that's meek and lowly and you'll follow him wherever he goes and along the way he will never force you but he'll give you opportunities to make some very hard decisions that you could pick up your cross and follow him by your own choosing right because thou has walked in thine own choosing now has chosen the harder way right you've walked in your own choosing and a great portion of heaven awaits thee right and i got to thinking this you know remember brother branham went behind the veil i'm sorry it's okay still okay right you're quiet on me but if at the dinner table sometimes they speak back so before long brother bannon goes behind the veil and when he gets behind the veil he says i want to see jesus and he says oh he'll come to you you are a leader he says oh he says uh will he come to paul he said oh yes he'll come to paul he said well good i preached exactly what paul preached what did the people say all of them all of them with one voice said one thing we are resting on that we we are resting we're not striving we're not laboring we are resting in this word that you preached was the truth and we've put our souls and we've yoked with it and we go with it wherever it leads us to go we bear it with honor you know what i mean so i'd ask you are you resting are you laboring are you fearful or are you concerned are you just resting in the palm of his hand realizing i've been watching over you every day of your life i've been thinking about you constantly i know exactly where you are i know exactly where you've been i know exactly where you're going i've been preparing you for your own decision from before the foundation of the world where you would give me a place of rest so that you could take yours you know what i mean brother branham makes the comment and you all know this he said all hell is against this mystery he said it goes right by them and they don't recognize it until it's gone and it only picks up a predestinated seed that god has predestinated from before the foundation of the world the same thing came through in the days of knowing the same thing came through in the days of moses elijah in the days of the prophets and of jesus and down through this very own hour the pregnant person with the seed of god and the word in there manifesting itself not manufacturing anything not trying to be a believer not trying to live a christian life humbly believing accepting the word and it's producing its own life nothing i am doing nothing you ever have to do you just believe it you accept it and it produces its own life every seed brings forth of its own kind what does it have to do nothing all the seed does is really drink in water and it pushes out a life that's all it's ever had to do he says not say my church now my church your church has nothing to do with it this is an individual one person and all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth jesus never did say now peter james you and john the rest of you no you've got the revelation and the whole church is and the whole church is safe no it was to him personally and i say unto thee not to them to thee thou art peter and upon this rock i build my church and the word peter means little stone or a confessed one and or a separated one so all hell was against you as an individual making him your place of rest man you could do a lot of good things for god but don't give him preeminence my goodness that's the one thing like go to church every wednesday night go to every go to every meeting and sing very loudly but do not give him preeminence you realize that's the thing that the devil doesn't want you to do do it all else say amen to everything but just keep a couple of decisions for yourself there's a couple little spots this is mine i that now this is me that i gotta hold on to this that's all it takes guys just disbelieve one word what's all hell against the individual giving him preeminences over every decision and you cannot do it unless you love him because that love will produce a confidence and that confidence will produce a faith and that faith will produce a rapture and a place of rest for the individual amazing ain't it really something to think about so i told you my direction that's all the notes i have what else am i going to do i can say brother ben your turn but i believe i said what i i was supposed to say i'm just going to see if i have anything else here that i could no no i think that's it everyone let me think one more just found it brother ben says about jesus he said there come another adam which was christ never a one like him somebody says he is he he wasn't god but his uniqueness proved he was god there never was a creature like him he lived in a world to himself he was born outside of the realm of the natural sinful man hallelujah he was the creator himself made flesh who could ever stand where he stood i think that's a question who could ever stand where he stood who could ever talk like he talked who could ever say the things that he said who could ever do the things that he had done his uniqueness proved that he was god there wasn't a prophet or nothing else could do what he had done who could call the dead back to the grave who could stop the skies and do anything he wanted to he was god who could ever stand in his place what could he be but the perfect immortal god in flesh that dwelt among us nothing ever compared with him he lived in a world all to himself and this life this life of jesus if it ever puts forth another body of believers it will bear the same fruit that the first one did so my question who can do what he did if that vine puts forth another branch that vine the fruit of that vine will do the exact same thing he did it will look at any obstacle in any situation and say not my will but my father's will be done i believe the potentials are there it's just decision time god is known in simplicity and the revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person don't that make you say amen illiterate see not your theology but a revelation of jesus christ and upon this rock i'll build my church and no other rocks are accepted and no anything else is accepted no other roman rock protestant rock or other school no nothing but exactly the revelation of jesus christ through a new birth he's born in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with preeminences to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the very same thing through you outside of that the rest is not even called into it god's great revelation is unfolding by lack of this revelation is why we have so many divisions among us and so much mockery and so much division it is because people lack that revelation see they lack that revelation so here's here's a little tidbit the bible says one man keepeth the day as unto the lord and another doesn't keep a day as unto the lord you know that scripture and another one he eateth meat as unto the lord but this other one he doesn't eateth meat has unto the lord so let me ask you a question should we do like some of the disciples did that said hey lord they're preaching but they're not with our group we should call down fire from heaven and burn them up and jesus said what spirit's on you leave him alone let them go just let them go if they're not against us they're for us just let them go you know and so these things you know we're not um we're not okay because we believe a certain doctrine you know sometimes people don't understand things i certainly don't understand a lot of things i'm learning every day and the more i know the more i know i don't know and i remember to realize i'm just a canary brain and i only know what he tells me anyhow so at the end of the day i might as well just serve god with the best i know how. and i better leave everybody else alone because they're trying to serve god the best they know how and if i could be a help to them i'll try to be a help and an example in any way i can but outside of that who am i to tell them you know what i mean in some certain situations like that you've had to go back and i've had to go back and say you know what god bless them anyhow and i mean it sincerely god help them god bless them because they know i know i need my help too help me to express help me to make these hard decisions in my life i don't want to be one that's just rallying around a group of people that we we've all claimed to believe a certain set of dogmas a certain set of truths and now i find confidence because i'm a part of the right group that's insecurity the only security i'll ever have is when jesus christ is personally made known to me in this revelation and i begin to express that revelation not of my own will but because the life that's in me is expressing itself and then i can have a confidence will you stand and musicians will you come i told you i go until i run out of things to say and i ran out of things to say do you understand what i was saying though you understand the direction all i had was a direction for you all but i do believe it was of god i believe it was his grace to us help us not to get help us to understand what his great desire was a rest a real rest in an individual and understand where i get my rest i get my rest in doing the will of god i don't get my rest from knowing something i get my rest from being in his presence in his presence is where i'm wanting to be and to live i don't want to go in and out of that one i believe the shekinah glory the curtain shut behind him and shut him in behind it and he was shut in behind the veil with god and that's where god wanted him and that's where the man wanted to be and that's where i want to be and that's where i all want us to be you all want to be there decisions to be made but i'm so thankful that we have an almighty god that would be so kind and so concerning of us to just say why don't you just come take some rest that to me is just a wonderful thing and the hour in which we're living when there's weariness and distractions and concern and fear all around your father whispers hey come relax just just relax right here under my presence in my presence don't worry everything is fine amen let's just have a word of prayer here heavenly father we just come before you lord we always are appreciative of the word that you've given us and lord of your presence it's so simple sometimes but you said it would be you said it'd be so simple that a fool should not air in sometimes in our own messed up ways we over complicate things we over complicate you that's what made you so great was because you could become so simple and men tends to do this and it's our even our own fallen nature that begins to try to make you something greater than what you're trying to be simple for the people what a great god you really truly are lord and i just pray that you would help each and every one of us to understand the simplicity that is found in trusting you it's not him that willeth or him that runeth it was god that showed us mercy and lord each and every one of us could lift up our hands bow our heads and say lord where would i be if you wouldn't have come towards me it wasn't us pressing towards you what could we do and of ourselves we can't add one inch to our stature nor could we add one hair to our head the bible says we can do nothing how can we take a complete and utter body change unless we're just taking a step day by day walking in your presence with your word and lord you're bidding us to come to do that what an honor it is to each and every one of us father i pray that you would help us i pray that you'd give us all wisdom i pray that you would give us all of your nature and of your life father so that the things that you left undone for this day in this age and for the fulfillment of your body could be done in each and every one of us for the glory of god and not our own lord may things be done that you had in the back parts of your mind that you wanted to see accomplished be done and the simplicity of a housewife simplicity of a farmer of a mechanic making you their their their purpose in life making you there giving you the preeminences and decisions made and directions taken lord we so appreciate it and i appreciate your word so very very much and lord i just pray that you'd watch over our pastor brother elia as they'll be traveling home lord i pray that when they get home you'll give them rest for their natural bodies father lord they've they've went because of love for you and for your people and made a great sacrifice and no doubt the people appreciate it and we appreciate that that they've done that for them lord we just pray that you watch over them keep them safe and strengthen their bodies for the services to come and father i just pray for everyone that's here lord will you just continue to walk with us lord we sure love you what could we say more than we love you search our hearts like david said if there be anything wicked in us father will you help to get it out of our lives we don't want it there we know that we have this hybrid flesh this body of flesh we fight it every day but father you've said greater is he that's in me than he that is in this world so father we just submit believing you that you keep your word finish the work lord that you began in each of our lives and express the great mystery that you had we sure love you and thank you in jesus name amen amen i have a song brother there's a voice calling me from an old rugged dream [Music] [Music] far behind there are new highs to climb and a new place with me find for whatever it takes to draw closer [Music] [Applause] and whatever it
