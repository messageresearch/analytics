going to be in rehab for at least a week longer and so just pray that the lord will give him strength to that right side of his body so he can walk and be stable and get to go home as soon as possible i know his family would love to have him back home and back with them and also uh i i believe brother um ben seabolt's going to be traveling up this weekend to preach for brother dan ratliff in

be here we're happy to have brother already with us he's a good friend of mine he's been pastoring a church there in new zealand for the last nine years and and i've traveled there and been in his place he's been here you'll remember he was here a few years ago and he's a good friend wonderful brother we've had a wonderful time of fellowship together around the world and so i'm excited to hear what the lord has laid on his heart amen and if you come excited to hear what the lord has laid on his heart come ready to receive the word of god we know how this works the prophet taught us the flesh is just the veil but if we can go beyond the veil of flesh and tap into a resource that god's given us in the fightful ministry we can pull down from heaven exactly what we have need of we believe that god will do that for us today so we're just going to invite our brother with a song now brother john more than ever before oh lord i love you [Music] more than ever before oh lord i need

same god fellow uh fellow citizens of the kingdom of god so i trust that we that you'll just have a lovely time tonight i just really appreciate your pastor and i just really appreciate his ministry really love him as a as a as a example and as a friend and just these these incidents i wonder if you want to take your seats just for a moment i feel bad to keep you standing thank you very much musicians god bless you something i i can say of brother chad is that there's a genuine humility and a love for his sheep that has been such an example to me um i i will never forget when when we were in the philippines a few years ago um the morning we were going down to the uh to have breakfast and brother chad got out of the lift out of what do you call it here elevator elevator and uh as he was getting out he he said to me because i was taking the service that that morning and he said to me brother i was lying awake at night and i was praying for you and it just means so much you know just we're all part of the same body and we just want to you know bear one another up before the lord and we're all working for the same goal it's no big one here and little one there god is good and god uses each one of us different we are very different you probably hear my accent is different i trust you can understand me all right i'll say like brother banham says about the dutchman take me for what i mean not for what i say so i trust that you can just have a blessed time i also just want to remember to bring the regards from so many saints back home there's a number of you that's visited us back there and and each one of you were mentioned by the name to say please pass on regards and various people in church i'm just going to do a global god bless you from from back home also from my wife paula she she specially asked me please express my love and i want to also do that she her heart is here tonight she would have liked to be here with me and to be able to see you all and fellowship with you all so i don't want to take any more time but i wonder let's just stand for a moment and turn in our bibles to genesis chapter 1. i'm sure you'll find that real easy genesis chapter 1 and we're going to read verses 11 and 12. and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the water called the seas i'm sorry i started at verse 10. let's try 11. and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit are for his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and her building seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good and i want to just focus on that little clause there which says after he's kind every seed bringing forth after his kind we're just going to read that that far let's just pray one more time before we before we take our seats precious father [Music] lord there's so so much power in your word father oh lord i just recently just felt overwhelmed lord by the privilege of standing here at the end of time having the privileged lord to see this word open to see so much of your word fulfilled or jesus to have the benefit lord of hindsight to look back over the ages and see how the prophecies came out exactly as you said lord father we were not sitting 2000 years ago or anywhere in between father guessing when you would return not knowing what age we were in or nothing father but we know where we're at lord oh father we just thank you for it lord we are such privileged people lord our father tonight i just want to ask again lord that you will anoint your word father i pray that you will take me out of the way let me maybe not be aware of myself lord and just surrender to the leading of your precious holy spirit have your way father i pray that you will shut my mouth for anything that is not of you or jesus but that you will speak your oracles lord i committed to you i pray that your holy spirit the inner teacher will take this word and guide it to exactly the right places in each life according to our need we ask it in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen you may take your seats so i will i will start off by a little bit of an escape clause i trust it's okay to take my jacket off i'm used to winter weather at the moment so this is nice and warm um so i'll say this that you know if what i find is when you travel sometimes um you have different terminology that you use for the same concept or sometimes you know everyone everyone looks at the mountain from a slightly different angle and saying things slightly different so if if the way you you hear me saying it is a little different to what you used to please forgive me and i want to say you've got a wonderful pastor and i'm not here to go against anything that that he's teaching you i i really respect him and so forth but i just want to use a a brother nestor quote he says i just want to come to be a blessing and i feel like that tonight i just want to be a blessing so if you can get a blessing tonight then then it's worth the while so i've been preaching a little series at home where i was speaking about the different gifts in the body and and it's a subject that had been taught on a lot and that's not my main focus tonight but i just thought i'll just drop that in because some of the things i will speak on is very applicable to that thought that each one of us have have one or more in probably in all our cases multiple gifts and things that god uses and he uses it in the body so i just wanted to throw that in as a little bit of a background now we read in our opening scripture in the book of genesis how god works on a principle in his creation that every seed brings forth of its kind and that's a god-given law and that's how god created it and god is consistent in this way there's no oopsies right there's no oh my goodness what happened here i planted a pumpkin and tomorrow tomato is coming up when when the seed goes into the ground the result that comes out the fruit that comes out is the evidence of what the seed was that went in now of course we know the the practical application of this the the life of christ that went into the seed that original original seed that went in comes forth and it bears fruit and when we look at the fruit we know what the original seed was amen so when we look at attributes of god being manifested then we know that it comes from the gene of god i mean so now when we look around us when we walk out the doors and we see things happening in this world we are surrounded by satan's eden we're surrounded by so much filth and and everything we see is proof and evidence of the fact that there was not only godly seed sowed we see around us is proof of the fact that like that that story jesus told about the sower that went forth and then another enemy went forth and sowed morsi there's evidence of that fact and when we look at what's happening around us it is it is it has gone absolutely crazy in in new zealand these and i don't know how things are here but in new zealand there's there's laws that's that's now being put into place where we it comes to a point where you're not even allowed to tell anyone they're a boy or a girl anymore you know it's gotten to that point how much how much sense does that make it doesn't even make logical sense but but everything has gone so haywire that people don't know where they are anymore i was saying you know every government form we felt fill in now is you know are you a male female or other i haven't met the other yet but but you see everything is going going crazy like that and what is that's the evidence of that other seed that went into the ground the evidence that they were perverted seed but at the same time we're not looking at the negative right at the same time the bride is being matured at the same time the bride is coming to her fullness and just like satan's eden is coming to maturity hallelujah we're living in that time where that former and later rain is coming together and and as the seeds are going into the ground the growth is real fast and just as much as all the perversion is going on and coming to maturity and really coming out of the closet so to speak and all sorts of rubbish i mean in the same way the word of god is bearing food fruit quickly now in this age because that that that that sowing rain and the harvest rain is coming together now hallelujah and and both sides are being prepared for a harvest hallelujah one tree one side is prepared to be burnt the other side is being prepared to reign with christ hallelujah so now brother branham preaches that message the spoken word is the original seed and he uses that same scripture reading that i use tonight and and in the broader scheme of things you know we can make the general statements and i will start with that but since the spoken word is the original seed the crop that's now being matured in the bride in this harvest time is the original word again the fruit is back to the original word again but the seed that went into the ground did not abide alone it did not stay singular i mean the seed went into the ground but it's bringing forth a whole crop hallelujah and now this crop that is being produced is a multiplication of that original seed or a further expression of the original seed but you see our god is a god of variety our god when he planted the garden of eden he planted a variety he made the earth with variety brother branham speaks about how he made mountains and streams and and grassy areas and bushy areas and god is a god of right variety god doesn't just make one thing and and this sort of a one-size-fits-all kind of approach guy didn't say let's be very efficient now now look let me let me put it this way if i had to design it i would have been you know i would have said well let's you know let's let's make it as efficient as we can so so let's you know instead of making all these different fruits and you have to travel all over the world and in this day import things from here and import things from there let's just make a fruit that is perfect you know let's let's just use an example as a blueberry right that people say blueberry is very healthy for you so let's use a blueberry but let's say we would have said let's take all the nicest flavors and put it together into this one little fruit and we would say all the minerals that you could ever need and all the vitamins you could ever need and all the benefits and everything let's put it together in this one fruit right and and and god planted the whole garden just full of this fruit and this is all we would have had now now you know god could have done that but that's not who god is that does not reflect who god is and god could have done that but and i wanted to say if we ate that fruit for the first time you're looking at me like where's he going this is crazy stuff just just be with me right but i want to say if we ate that fruit the first time it would have been amazing it would have blown us away it would have exploded on our ballot it would have you know the healing powers of it and so forth we would have really enjoyed it but you see mankind just like the children of israel over time we would say like they did our soul loathes us this light bread god gave them manna god gave them heavenly bread god gave them everything they needed it was so good for them that they didn't get sick nothing but they got to a point where they said our soul loatheth this light bread you see for our human even our human taste how boring would that get even how wonderful it would have been the most amazing fruit if you had that day in day out all you got it would get really boring now of course we know that there is a tree that has all the perfect properties and it was not one of the natural trees in the garden the bible says they were all the trees in the garden and the tree in the midst of the garden now that tree has all the properties we ever need right if we did take of that tree that's got all the vitamins that's got all the nutrition that we ever need spiritually speaking right and that's still that that tree still exists today and that tree of life is a person and that's the person that we should be in spiritual union with in this day hallelujah that tree of life and that's what we're speaking about tonight i mean that's what we should be speaking about every service him the tree of life our personal tree of life our relationship with him and so forth but when it comes to his creation god is a god of variety let's just put up that picture just to kind of reflect that thought god made sweet and sour god made big and small god made light and heavy round and oval and pear-shaped and all sorts of things straight and bent and in all those things god reflects his attribute that he is a god of variety and god knew that his children was going to one like a banana and the next one like a pear and the next one like a watermelon and so forth but you know it's also the same with sons and daughters of god god did not take a cookie cutter and make us all exactly the same all the attributes that were in god before the foundation of the world each one of them is different each one of them is unique each one of them reflects something about god in their own unique way and god has you know in our human expression god has short and tall and wide and thin and dark and light and everything in between god has all sorts of variations god is witty god is slow god is deep thinkers god is lighthearted guide us all those things and god has made us such but there's one thing that every son and daughter of god has in common and that is that we come from god and we will go back to god everyone as different as we are hallelujah we can look at one another and say i don't know how he can be a son of god i don't know how she can be a daughter of god because they're so different to me and of course because i look from my perspective you look so off so different so other right but from god's perspective you fit in in your spot and i fit in in my spot amen and god has designed it like that and we all come from god hallelujah and we want to go back to god and we all are unique we all have in this flesh a unique dna unique fingerprint and so forth this bride this many membered a bunch of eternal attributes of god if i can use that term as different as we are god is preparing us for a rapture god is preparing us for a body change i'll put it this way god is in this rapturing process working on us i mean to prepare us for that finality for that body change now each of us have have hopefully heard the shout and maybe there's some sitting you haven't heard that shout really internally yet but if you're an elected son or daughter of god you will hear it you will respond nothing can get can go against that right and if we now sitting under that or under the i want to say the anointing or in the phase or in the fold of the shout part uh sorry in the the voice part i mean where god is now working on us and i was fellowshipping with with brother chad it's like the main thought that i've been preaching on over the last few years because it's all about the voice it's all about where we are at now where god is getting preeminence in his church where god's word is getting preeminence in us where god is forming our character we god is building us up so that we can sit and reign with him on the throne so that he can take us home and place us as his queen on his throne and what we will need brothers and sisters i love that quote in the church age book where he says authority with character is sorry authority without character is satanic but authority with character is fit to rule god is preparing a bride who is fit to rule and god is doing it now under the voice part of the threefold purpose and all of that happens because we were part of him from before the foundation of the world and we are being restored back to him in this redemption process and that's the big picture that's what god does to the body as a whole and that's our purpose and that's our journey and that's our goal because it's god's goal and therefore it's our goal but for the bride as a body to mature god needs to mature each individual in that body but because every member of the body is unique the details of your and my individual maturing process may look just slightly different because god needs different ways to deal with each one of us based on how he made us so the maturing process you know it's so easy to look at how god is working with this one how god is working with that one and we can we can we can get uh uh uh this discomforted or something and look but god doesn't work with me like that or god doesn't use me like that or or god doesn't allow these things in my life or whatever it is we can get so uptight about all those things instead of saying god work with me god you know my makeup you know how me how you made me you know what you need to work on me you know what you need for me to be rapture ready hallelujah and it all works together for god's glory to come under god's threefold purpose but under that threefold purpose based on our different roles and placings and how god wants to use each one of us and what our makeup is it may look slightly different for each one of us and that's so important that's probably you know one of the one of the the questions that pastors face very often is why can't i be like that brother why can't i be like that sister and so forth and we struggle with things instead of just looking at god you know god is saying what is that to thee follow the army right it all works together for god's purpose i put it in these terms each stone in the temple of god has a different place in the body remember we are typed as the new jerusalem every stone in the new jerusalem every stone in the temple of god whatever terminology you want to use every stone is unique and every stone is chosen by god to be in that temple but each one of us have a different place in the temple and i'm not going to go down that road now but we can't take one another's place no one else will fit in the hole that god has made for you but at the same time you cannot fit in someone else's hole you might try and it will actually bring this disconnect in the body but god has a place for each one of us but here's the thing god might need slightly different tools for each one of us you see some some stones may be really close to what they should be and maybe for some stones god only need to use a bit of sandpaper and you know just shave off a little here and there but then there's some stones where god needs a bit of a you know hammer and a chisel and chisel some corners off and then there's some stones like me that he has to really get going on and he needs to but take a big hammer and get some you know a lot of nonsense off that stone in order to fit into that place that god had for me amen but god works differently with each one of us and god needs a very specific stone for a very specific purpose and each one of us brothers and sisters that's i want to encourage you you know i know sometimes when you come from this perspective it actually discourages people because people start thinking where do i fit and what is my role and poor me and i want to be this i want to be that i want to say let god show amen brother brahma speaks about how the gift will make place for itself right we don't have to worry about it let's just walk forward with god and god will do it right so now i just want to take brother branham as an example for for a moment and and and i trust you will see this in context now now god needed a very specific stone for a very specific and important job and that stone was lying in a weed pile somewhere that stone had a seventh grade education that stone was dirt poor he had no religious credentials his family had no religious credentials he was raised in the house of a drunkard he witnessed firsthand probably the worst of what that era could offer he saw you know he describes how he saw people breaking their marriage vows and you know bri lying around drunk and having to be sobered up to go home to cook their husbands a meal and stuff like that it's probably the worst excesses of that time god allowed that stone to grow up in that environment right because god had a purpose in it so god had to get going with his hammer and chisel and god had to give him some serious blows i remember growing up and mom would read us the stories of brother branham in what was those days just the footprint footprints in the sands of time book and we would cry and we would love the the life story and so forth but god had to really deal with with brother brennan god had to brother adam speaks about how he ran away and he wanted nothing to do with preachers he wanted nothing to do with it but yet on the inside god had been calling in him since he was a little boy and god was preparing him blow after blow after blow but god had his hand on that stone and at god's appointed time that stone was ready for service god has a vision for the temple and god has a vision where every stone would fit in but when we look at ourselves we can so easily miss god's perspective this doesn't want to flick over there we go it's so easy so easy for us just to look at the raw product instead of looking at what god wants to achieve it's so easy for us to just look at our humanity where that stone is looking in there is sitting in a weed pond you see when god looks at that heap of rubble god doesn't see a heap of rubble god sees every stone's potential and god sees that stone as he's going to use it in his war this is an expression when god looks at the heaps of heap of stones that's what he says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you what thoughts are is he thinking towards us god knows exactly where he wants to use you god knows exactly all about you and let me let you in on the secret god knew every mistake you were going to make and god knew how it was going to affect you and god knew what was he what he was going to achieve even through your mistakes because everything worked together for good amen for the elect not for everyone for the elect everything worked together for the good for us hallelujah god says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil amen when you're on the weed pile god sees you to come to that expected end god sees you already from the perspective of the expected end god doesn't see you on the wheat pile in god's perspective you never on the wheat part god always looks at you as exactly how he's used he's gonna use you hallelujah god still sees what he saw before the foundation of the earth now we're speaking about the bride and we're speaking about getting rapture ready and how god is maturing every stone in the building now and and i'm just gonna for a moment use use the human body as an example again god is using every organ in the body and preparing us to work together i mean and every little blood vessel every little cell and whether you're the heart or the brain or the small finger or whatever little cell it is we all need to work together for one purpose and there's no big one or little one among us like i said earlier i mean god uses every bit to contribute everything that is needed for it all to work together as god wants us to every cell down to the smallest part and let me just shift the focus to jesus now as an example so i highlighted how the spoken word is the original seed i spoke about how god is a god of variety and so forth so maybe yeah let me let me speak about jesus first so now jesus i want to say that the flesh manifestation of jesus right was in god's mind and plan we know how the bible says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the earth right jesus was that lamb jesus is that lamb he's not a past tense person right he is that lamb and god foresaw jesus as that lamb so the lamb of god jesus in flesh was in god's mind before the foundation of the earth was an attribute in god's mind that sonship that expression of god so the bible clearly state that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the earth so jesus the lamb of god the flesh expression of god i mean where god was going to express himself in human flesh was a thought or an attribute in elohim when he was the self-existing one dwelling by himself dwelling with his thoughts now let me read in john 1 1 you know these things very well in the beginning was the word and i put that that logos in there in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with god and the logos was god so what happened there there was i want to say there was an expression or the transformation where that thought that attribute now was expressed into a word form into a logos form so you have thought to word now and then then when god spoke it it was no longer just hidden in the mind of god now there was an expression of the mind of god and that word i believe was the logos or the theophany of god so now here's the thing when we speak about the word the word the word the word the word the word many times when we speak about the word people think about a book like this which in you know today like it comes in the form of ipads and phones and all sorts of things right but the word is a person the word is not you cannot contain the logos in a book like this you cannot contain the attributes of god on paper nothing the world cannot contain the whole like that song sees nothing can contain the logos of god because there's always more than what we can contain that's why we can never be a denomination because as soon as we draw our circle god just grows out of the circle right praise god so there's certainly more than what we can write down on paper yet god spoke many things about that lamb of god amen god spoke it through the prophets god prophesied in fact in the garden of eden god promised the seed of the woman right god spoke it in so many ways and he expressed himself he did not only do it through the prophets he did it through the psalms he did it through the lives of the patriarchs and so forth you know all those beautiful things that we can go into of joseph and different ones but when it was time for jesus to come on the scene there was an existing canon of of prophecy that was there that pointed directly to that attribute of god a whole old testament worth of prophecies and examples and types and shadows and and laws and feast days and all sorts of things that was promised that was looking forward to that attribute of god and it was written in mystery form it was hidden from the wise and prudent but revealed at exactly the right time to sons and daughters who could receive it and then in according in accordance to verse 14 and the word the logos was made flesh and dwelt among us and what happened now that that thought that had become word was now going into flesh into flesh form so it was extended another step the word which was the word of prophecy which was the logos that was spoken by god in the beginning and expressed again through lives of of prophets and and the word of prophets and and all the patriarchs and all those things that was now expressed like that now became into a manifestation form and i want to say he was the son of man and it was the son of man in male 4 it was the son of a man in ram form he was that he was that masterpiece that i want to say the male masterpiece of god that was expressed in that day hallelujah so what we have now the thought of the land that was going to be slain that was expressed as logos now became flesh now god lived through that flesh god accomplished everything in that flesh that he intended to do god accomplished through that flesh everything that was that was associated with that attribute right there in god's mind before the foundation of the earth you see god had intended for that attribute for that flesh expression of him to be born as a baby in a stable grow up be persecuted go through the whole process be hung on a cross give his life and be raised again and all of that was contained in the attribute of god in that thought of god and god knew all of that before there was an atom that was god's plan it was entrenched in god in other words we can say everything that the spoken word the original seed had intended for the jesus attribute to express and you know where i'm going with this right was accomplished in the life of jesus and there was no power on earth that could stop the thoughts of god from becoming manifest there is no power on earth that can stop any spoken word seed of god from coming to fruition and bringing forth the crop that god had in mind for that seed i'm going to move back to brother branham now for a moment so now you know we've used jesus as an example and i and and i trust you see this in context i'm not lifting the prophet up as a man but i'm using his as him as an example as our wave chief what he was in this day so now i want to say without a doubt and i know in some places they would crucify you for saying things like this but in the mind of god in the mind of that elohim the self-existing one hallelujah there was an attribute of an elijah ministry that would come to announce the second coming of the lord jesus i have no doubt in my mind about that and then god spoke that logos into existence and when god expressed his attributes in logos form i believe the theophany of brother branham was in that low gospel don't get nervous on me now brother branham's theophany and i'll put it this way i believe and i'll just state that up front so that we get the context now i believe the bride's theophanies as a whole was the female part of the logos of god brother rahm says the logos was god's theophany right and we were expressed there with him we were expressed we went from thought to word at the same time brothers and sisters when jesus christ went from thought to word when we read when we read john 1 i'm just going to go back to john 1 1. when we read john 1 1 i believe it's not only speaking of the mail in the beginning was the word and i was part of that word and if i look at that through my humanity i cannot do that but if i look at it through the prophetic word through the manifestation of what god brought to us in this day through the revelation of what god brought us i can say amen lord i don't know how it works i don't know what you're gonna have to do to change this fallen flesh that's struggling and fighting and battling every day god but i know that i was there and when the bible says in the beginning was the word when it all started when the first movement happened with the when the first point that could be a point of reference for time to begin in the beginning god expressed you and me with jesus christ in word for hallelujah and that's when sons and gods started jumping for giant and shouting for joy i i don't understand all those things but i know it's real hallelujah so now god was thinking before the foundation of the word of that elijah prophet and then god created the whole canon of of prophecy again about that elijah prophet that would come and sorry i'm just gonna move down here a little bit just like eve was part of adam the bride was part of god and when god took out of god sorry out of adam and expressed eve it just reflected what god had already done to take out of himself i mean the bride and so forth the bride was absolutely part of that logos so now just to go back to brother branham there was a thought in god's mind and god started ex god expressed that in theophany form but that also then also through the through the prophets and over time god released little tidbits little prophecies different things about this elijah of the end time and we know malachi 4 and you know we know revelations 3 of the letter to the church of laodicea right and so forth and the bible also recalls how that angel that showed john around you know and showed him the book of revelation showed him the the great and different things and you know how he would cry come out of him my people be not partakers of her sin and so forth and we read how i believe that was brother branham and i and we read in the bible how john wanted to worship him and he bowed down and he wanted to worship him and he said don't do it i mean i'm of you of your fellow servants the prophets and so forth [Music] and then we move on and we see in revelations 10 i mean how that heavenly angel comes down to that same person hallelujah and he clears with a loud voice and gives him the book and he breaks the seals and and releases it to us and the thunders go forth and so forth so at god's appointed time and season all those prophecies now went from thought in elohim to theophany to flesh now we know the prophet says it it was different for us than it was for jesus he went directly from attribute to thought to flesh and i can't explain all the all the technicalities in the in the ma in the the manifestation of that but very clearly the prophet speaks about how adam was in his theophany and and so forth and and we we came like adam came and brother branham now when he came on the earth now now please forgive me for do this for doing this i trust no one's got a problem with that but i'm going to say when jesus came in a flesh expression he came in a stinking stable as a little baby out of a woman that came from nazareth and so forth to the extent where everyone knew how bad nazareth was and i think it was nathanael that said could anything good come out of nazareth we can say in this day again and i'm not lifting up brother branham to the level of jesus christ don't get me wrong but we can say in this in this day and age can everything good come out of the backwoods of kentucky out of a drunk man's home hallelujah but yes because the goodness was not in the flesh expression the goodness comes from the seed of god hallelujah just like for you and me no matter what circumstances we grew up in no matter what affected us no matter how much we our lives were messed up but when that rebirth comes brothers and sisters it lifts us up to a higher reality that has nothing to do with that old flesh yet the paradox is god can use our circumstances to form that stone so that we are ready for him to use i want to encourage you with that so we can say again that the word became flesh and dwelt among us don't go too far with it but we can say again the word became flesh the word that said that we there would be a malachi 4 5 prophet the word that spoke about the seventh angel the word that said that revelations 10 the angel came down that word became flesh in the life of william branham and i'm going to say again the word that god had in his mind from before the foundation of the earth hallelujah now i want to look at the bride now because that was the wave sheath and i know you know exactly where i'm going so you can relax and i can relax right so now let's look at the bride as a whole and we can do exactly the same as what we did with brother we see how elohim had us in mind and now we were part of his logos or word or theophany and how he spoke through his prophets about the bride and now he spoke through the examples in the bible we read about joshua and caleb we read about rebecca we read about tamar elisha following elijah hallelujah we have we have a canon of prophecy that's looking at the bride hallelujah so there's prophecy lying there there was thought in god's mind attribute in god's mind god expressed it in logos form and god expressed it through his prophets god expressed it as prophecy but there is a point at which that prophecy is being fulfilled and of course we know that the bride it was expressed over seven church ages and so forth and we know that in that last time when the rapture rapturing processes is on the go and we where god is wrapping it all up and getting us all ready so now the bible speaks of to us and say directly i send you elijah the prophet even in that scripture you and i are there and and i want to say there's something profound about that because before the foundation of the earth when elohim was thinking of your attribute my attribute he was also associating our attribute with the messenger he was going to use to carry that message to you and me hallelujah and god associated us with that and god knew then right that he was going to bring us in this age and that god was going to quicken us under this eagle anointing and bring us up in this age where he's going to prepare us to take a rapture to take a body change god did not intend for us to come under luther's ministry god had not intended us to come under wesley's ministry but if god had then we would have been bright for that age if we were in god's mind but you and i were associated with this ministry in this age and i want to say i thank god for it it's probably from a mental pressure perspective the hardest age to to live in but it's also the most wonderful age because we are so privileged with how much word god has made available so when we look at these things as the body of the bride as a whole it has gone again from attribute to thought or sorry from attribute or thought to word or logos or theophany and then to flesh now i'm just going to read a quote there about that eagle story i love that eagle story loved it since i was a kid brother ram says here and he would hear that hen cluck he would try his best to cluck but he couldn't do it he tried to cheap like a chicken but he could not do it see he was an eagle he to start with was an ego he was just hatched out under a hand just like all of us right but there was something in us from not just the start from from forever and forever and forever hallelujah that was going to be an eagle and one day his mommy flew over and she screamed he recognized it why because he heard it before just in another form hallelujah amen praise god that sounded right why he was an eagle to begin with he was always an eagle god always saw him or her as an eagle that's the way it is with the gospel or the word or the power of jesus christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life in other words you were in the mind of god he hears that true ring scream of god nothing can keep him from it because how can you change the thoughts that were in god's mind the old mammy said son jump you're an eagle come up here where i am he said mom i never jumped in my life and she's saying what's that got to do with it right she said well you jump you're an eagle to begin with you're not a chicken i mean but mommy i'm finding myself among the chickens in the barnyard and they all want to eat all this uh you know scraps on the floor and mommy says yes i know you haven't experienced anything else but you're you're eager you're not a chicken although you might have scratched around with them in the barnyard you are not a chicken hallelujah so he made his first jump and flopped his wings didn't do too good but he got off the ground hallelujah he says that's the way we do we accept god by faith by the written word there is something in there it's that eternal life you were predestinated to it you have been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany hallelujah we heard from the expression of the thought that was in god's mind hallelujah so now what gets us out of our condition is when we hear from alfie offer when we hear from our word representation and when we recognize who we are when we recognize i'm an eagle to begin with in other words i was part at what was prophesied for this age as the bride of christ in fact the mere fact that i have a theophany hallelujah proves that i was in the mind of god hallelujah because god doesn't express anything other than his attributes and his thoughts in word form in that logos form so now that partly takes us to my title tonight i'll just remind you of my title the spoken word in each fruit so let's continue and just develop that thought a little further but from god's principle every seed brings forth of its kind remember we started off with that and the original spoken word seed brings forth spoken word fruit now let's take it a little further i want to make it a little more practical and tangible by god's help tonight so now i want to look at at it more practically and bring it more individual than group now i'll ask you this when you were that thought in god's mind before the logos was expressed what did god think about you what were god's thoughts about you remember we read that scripture in jeremiah where it says i know the thoughts i think about you right what were god's thoughts about you in fact what was the expected end that god was thinking about about you right maybe i should ask it this way how much did god know about you we can say it this way god took a picture of you and put it in his family album before the foundation of the world but when god took that picture he did not took he did not take that picture of when you were at your lowest when you had made a mess of mess of your life and so forth god took that picture when you are in your prime god took that picture of we saw you right at the end we saw you back in eternity that picture that god took of you is a perfect picture of you and our problem is as humans we constantly look at this picture this fallen flesh but even while we're looking at this fallen flesh god is still looking i mean god doesn't need to do this i'm just dramatizing just to prove the point right but when we mess up so much and god would look over the banister and see that now remember he doesn't see that because he looks looks at us through the blood but just to demonstrate right god can go to that family album ah my boy my girl he's perfect and at the same time we think i'm such a mess i've messed up my life in god's perspective he's thinking of you as your expected end hallelujah god's not thinking of us in a fallen state come on the omnipotent god that knows everything that's a paradox that's wonderful i mean it's looking at us thinking of us as we're going to be when every every bit of wrong has been taken away when we when we're rid of this flesh eventually and all our human attributes and humanistic stuff so now i want to make this point when god looks at us on his family photo now now this is not a perfect family photo right but just to demonstrate the point what does god see about each of his offspring now remember i said in god's family photo we all happy we in the prime of youth we perfect like this is not the case but what is what is pertinent in a family photo i mean what's the first thing we do when you look at a family photo oh there's uncle so and so and there's auntie so-and-so and this cousin this and this grandma so and so right and that's the point i want to make god looks at us each individually and part of what he sees of us is our place in the family our place in the body part of that expected end that god is looking at for each one of us is exactly where we fit the people that we're going to be in contact with the people that we're going to affect and of course remember i said it's against the background of the gifts the people that god is going to touch through our gifts and each one of us are gifted in in multiple ways the people that god was going to affect through our gifts the messenger of the age that god was going to place us under the pastor the ministry that god was going to place us under all those things is associated with us because god places us in a specific place in his family photo god saw you from the start or from before the start as part of the family and god saw where you fitted in the family so to answer the question god knows everything about you yet when you confess your sin he doesn't know that part i love that right i can never get enough of that but the omniscient god knows everything and he knew everything about each one of us and god never learns anything new when we were in god's mind as an attribute he knew exactly where we were going to fit in his kingdom every role every office every calling and now i want you to to make this real practical i'm not speaking about just ministry and deacons and so forth right i want you to think of yourself in your role as as a father as a mother as a brother as a sister as a family member all of us have roles to fulfill in this body of christ right and every gift that god would place in you for your earthly journey god's thought about that because it's associated with the attribute and it's something that god wanted to manifest to bless his body with so now i i just want to throw this in for a moment it looks like the gift that god places us in earth on still is maintained when we change and and and the reason why i'm saying that and i'm not saying necessarily all the gifts i don't know all of those things but but i'll just use two examples in the old testament remember when saul called up samuel he still had his prophet clothes on and so forth and in our day brother branham when he went beyond the curtain of time they said you were a leader on earth you'll be a leader here and so forth god still acknowledges the blessings that he has on the other side so the point i'm making is god knew of every role every responsibility every gift that he was going to use you and me in but here's what i want to get you and this is just glorious and wonderful and i trust that god can give me grace to express it as much as i enjoy it if god's thoughts about you included the gifts and the callings that he predestinated you for and god expressed those those thoughts of you in me in logos form or in theophany form now stay with me it means that your theophany contains the dna contains the application carries the vitamins and the life for everything that you would need in the roles in your life for every role for every gift for every calling now i want to just bring it back to simple terms so that the youngest ones among us can relate to this god's thoughts about you became god's word about you that was your theophany and your spoken word or your part of the logos or your theophany your little part of god is what you hear from today and it's quickened by the holy spirit in your soul and brings forth fruit and the fruit that you and i bring forth is a result of what was captured in god's mind and expressed in theophany form then that original seed brings manifestation brings fruit of what was in god's mind about you regarding every placing and calling that god has for you so now really this is back to the title the spoken word in each fruit and the point i want to make is when we speak about the spoken word is the original seed amen when we speak about the spoken word for jesus being the original seed for him amen when we spoke about the spoken word for brother branham was the original seed for him amen but i want to say there's a spoken word for you there's your theophany part there's your spoken word part and that spirit spoken word i mean that is the original seed that went into the ground and that is the birth that wants to that god wants to see manifested here and god is god is the the husbandman god is the one that oversees that seed to bring it to the fruition i mean of what god had in his mind the result of god's thoughts but what i want to stress tonight is it's not just a group thing you see we can look at these things as the group as the bride as a whole but this very individual god thinks thoughts about each one and god wants to bring each one of us to the thoughts that he thought about us and the thoughts that god had of us brings us to the expected end that god has for us so we'll say it again god can rest in the fact or we can rest in the fact that our theophany contains everything god thought about us and you and i can draw from that when we hear from our theophany hallelujah and we can draw from that for every aspect of our lives that has eternal value the spoken word the original seed is living through us and is the inspiration and driving force behind our lives i want to go back to that quote about the eagle now but i just want to highlight the context a little bit brother ram says says the specific time in who is this melchizedek now the whole theme of that message was that god is here right that the son of man has returned again i mean that was the whole theme of it and the whole the whole point was you know brother ram turned around and and demonstrated and did the sign of the messiah to show not that william branham is something special i mean god was demonstrating he was expressing himself through a vessel but god was on the scene again i mean and god was identifying the son of man is back and when the son of man is back hallelujah he doesn't leave again until he leaves with his bride amen so that son of man said through a son of man in the in the 50s and in the sea or in the 60s i mean he could say who is this melchizedek but you and i can say in this day who is this melchizedek who is this one that's in me amen you see he expressed i'll ride this trail once more he's not going to bring a return ministry in terms of brother branham a return ministry but there is and forgive me i'm just saying this just as a comment there is a return ministry but but it's the same son of man that went into the ground that's returned now in bright form i mean that's what's returned the son of man has returned not in flesh form or in jesus's flesh form in our flesh hallelujah he's expressed he's expressing himself i mean he is riding this trail once more i mean we're not waiting for another eight messenger we're not waiting for brother brown to return again he had his time god used that vessel god brought him to his expected end alleluia but god wants to bring you and me to our expected end and god doesn't expect it and for you and god has gotten expected in for me and each one of us might look slightly different and what god brings us to might look slightly different because we're different stones in the in in the temple we're different parts in the body we're different fruits because god is a god of variety i mean he's not a cookie cutter god but the point is god is going to reflect what he had in his mind for you god is going to reflect what he had in his mind for me and as i said at the start i don't know how he's going to do it because i am so unworthy but he's gonna do it because he said it and there's nothing that can stop that word and i thank god and that's the thing i'm more thankful for for anything and although i can't explain it i just say thank you jesus hallelujah the things that were written about us god will bring it to pass amen but why does god do it god wants to give us a confidence in him a confidence in what he said about us a confidence in the prophecy and word about us but brother and sister and really this is my focus tonight it's so easy to hide in the group to have group faith yes we all as a bride is going to get to that but we need to come to individual revelation i am part of this bride and i'm not just a part of the bride i'm a specific part of the bride because god has specific thoughts about me god has specific things he intended for me and it takes all that guessing away hallelujah we can have confidence in what god see we can have confidence in what god is doing in us because he is bringing us to an expected end not our effort not our sincerity not our dedication enough we need all those things don't get me wrong but god is going to bring us in fact god is bringing us under this voice part of the rapturing process god is bringing us to our expectation god is forming us into what he saw in his mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah i want to make more one more comment on on dna before i move on now i want to say this i don't know too much of dna so you know if you know more please forgive me in my ignorance but my understanding is this that every cell in our bodies contains all the dna information to bring forth this body but what happens is that depending on where that specific cell will be used a part of that dna is anointed to bring forth a liver cell and another part of their dna is anointed to bring forth a brain cell a blood vessel or whatever isn't that wonderful amen every son and every daughter of god contains the whole dna of god you know in in potential form but god anoints a specific little part i'll just put it this way i trust god will make it alive to you but god had a thought that was expressed that thought was expressed in the logos the word form that original seed form hallelujah and that and and each one of our parts god anoints that little part of his thought and expresses it through you but in every son and daughter of god is the whole dna of god available but he anoints our little part to bring us to an expected end to bring us to the bit that he wanted to use us for in the temple in the body of god that's just wonderful that's god's life god's zoe life in the bride but god doesn't express through my myself brother chad's predestinated path god anoints me to bring forth my part god expresses in me the placing the gift the all the things that god wants to do through me and he achieves through me what he wants to do through me and that's all by his predestination and that intelligence is in the logos in our is expressed through there and only god anoints the path that you and i need individually i want to look at it from another angle just to clench the nail a little more earlier i referred to how brother branham was that angel that showed john around and so forth i just want to look at that quickly in the word i'm just gonna quickly skip over some of this in fact let's just look at this one yes revelations 19 the bible says and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren they have the testimony of jesus he says worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy brother braham says in the church book he says the spirit in paul which spirit is the spirit of christ for that is the spirit of prophecy whereby the word comes sees he sat down at the right hand of god now i believe that angel was brother branham like i said and i believe that john wanted to fall down and worship him he said to john in other words don't worship the vessel john don't worship the flesh john it's christ in me the hope of glory christ living behind this flesh and the spirit of christ in me is only expressing himself through this particular gift i'm just part of that body but don't glorify the vessel or glorify the gift but give the glory to god now i just want to use look at that wording the bible says the testimony of jesus christ brother brown refers to that the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy that word testimony means it's a witness it's an evidence it's to like to testify in front of a judge in other words an evidence of what hallelujah it's the evidence that christ is on the scene the testimony of jesus is the evidence that jesus is on the scene but in a different form hallelujah i love that so brother branham was saying to the bride don't worship me remember john represents the bride don't worship william branham hallelujah but he's saying but the fact that i am here shows it's the evidence it's a representation that melchizedek is back it's a representation that christ is here again hallelujah now let's just look at uh just to emphasize this i want to use look at at verses in the bible where that used that word testimony is also used we see about john the baptist there was a man sent from god whose name was john the same came forth for a witness for an expression for a testimony of god the word was displayed through john and so forth jesus says to nicodemus jesus answered and said unto him are thou master of israel and know us not these things verily verily i say unto you we speak but that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our testimony our witness our evidence there was the evidence amen of john 1 1 and john 1 14. the evidence was sitting in front of nicodemus hallelujah but he said you don't receive our evidence this bride can say to the world today hallelujah we are the testimony we are the witness we are the evidence that melchizedek is back we are the evidence that the son of man is back hallelujah when that word is expressed through us but you don't receive our testimony our evidence jesus said to the jews who wanted to kill him if i bear witness of myself and my witness my testimony my evidence is not true there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true you you sent unto john and he bear witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that you might be saved in other words man does not if uh uh evidence of me the fact that that god is on the scene that was the fact that the word is expressed that's the evidence that's the testimony he was a burning and a shining light referring to jonah and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light but i have greater witness i have greater evidence hallelujah than that of john for the works which the father have given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me and the that the father has sent me and i want to say brothers and sisters jesus christ was the evidence if i can use these terms i i hope this doesn't throw you for a moment jesus was the evidence of the ram lamb of god today you and i are the evidence of the you lamb of god again in hallelujah case of jesus he was the word in flesh but even in his humanity he acknowledged i'm not bearing witness of myself of my humanity of my human abilities but the works you see on display through my life is testimony that zoe life is present [Music] we can say today i am not bearing witness of this flesh i don't want to be a witness of this flesh the bible says crucify this flesh right but what i am bearing witness of by god's grace is that zoe life is present hallelujah and the more i can die to myself the more i can die to my nonsense and my failures and my all my shortcomings and complexes and issues the more god can be seen the more the testimony can be that zoe life is here zoe life is present that is how it should be for every son and daughter the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy the evidence of jesus christ is the eagle anointing on the bride when christ is king in our lives and we hear from our theophanies and he anoints us and uses us as he wants to and he displays his life through us look at this beautiful expression in juan john if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness the evidence of god which he hath testified of his son he that believeth on the son of god have the witness in himself hallelujah and you can say well i believe that jesus is lord no that's not what he's saying because brother adam says no man can say that jesus is lord until unless god has revealed it to him if god has revealed this to you and you are now from that revelation from that personal revelation i mean of what of who i am that personal revelation that i was in elohim i was part of it i am part of elohim i am an expression of the logos i am a part of that logos i am an expression in this day of what god intended to express in this day i am a little minute little portion i might be a little blood cell of this body but i am part of god and the dna is in me and nothing can take it away and god is working in me and god is is hitting on me with that hammer and chisel and god is dealing with me day by day but god is bringing me to an expected end and i trust him for it hallelujah amen he they have the son has life and he that hath not the son has not life has not that zoe life in us i mean we can say today i have the son i am a reflection of that son i am an expression of that son i'm an expression of a specific attribute that was in that song and like i said brothers and sisters it's so easy to look around us and say yeah i know brother so and so he's part of the bride because he looks so good and you might not know that brother so-and-so is battling just as much as you were better or sister so and so you know i'll give you some secret insight into pasta life for a moment right i hope this is okay brother chair but you know i so often have it that that the family would come to me and say i wish i can be like that family they're so picture perfect and their kids are all in place and all in order and then that family would come to me and say i wish i could be like that family right because we look at face value is this okay brother chad we look at face value and you don't recognize we are all in this together i mean we're all in this together let's lift each other up we do not have to compete to try to look like the family that's got it all right what we want is reality what we want is to be real what we want is to take god at this word and say god i'm not where i want to be not where i ought to be but i know where i want to be where i want to be is the thoughts that you had of me where i want to be when i want to be is that expected end that you saw for me that's where i want to be hallelujah i want to now just quickly link this through to revelation 10 goodness gracious our time is flying i will look for a place to close soon revelations 10 13 now remember in revelations 10 we read about the angel coming down and and so forth hands the book to the messenger who hands the book to the bride who then becomes the book and and i want to say comes in union with the book and then in verse 13 sorry in verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings i'm sorry i had the wrong verse there verse 11. you must prophesy again how what we just covered the spirit i mean the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy what i believe this bride in the end time is doing is we're expressing our individual expression of zoe life and the evidence that jesus christ under that eagle anointing is on the scene and that is what is being expressed and when we have to prophesy again now they prophesy yes it's what we say yes it's how we testify but much more so how we live and much more so you see that angel the light came from the angel to the earthly angel the heavenly angel to the earthly angel reflecting through now to the bride of this age and that when we partake of that book that like life of that book the life that zoe life is now being expressed and reflected and shining out through us amen so that light shining through us is what's expressing the testimony of jesus christ the spirit of prophecy hallelujah that's when we must testify again prophesy again and what we do brothers and sisters we are we are expressing we raying out to the world the dna of jesus christ the zoe life behind us and i'll come back to this and this is probably a good place to close now it's individual god is a god of variety the way in which god is going to reflect you through you and the way that god is going to reflect through me may look slightly different now it's going to have the same life behind it don't get me wrong zoe life is zoe life but god expresses zoe life through many different fruit it all looks slightly different but it's the spoken word in every fruit it is your spoken word that's reflecting through your life in other words the path that god foresaw for you as individual before the foundation of the earth that's what god wants to express through your life and through my life and that's my biggest prayer is god make that alive in my life you see this can be a concept this can be some far off theological idea but it needs to come down to where the rubber hits the road on the everyday walk the only way this happens is when we die daily when we repent daily when we get daily our own nonsense our own complexes our own little roots of bitterness our own things out of our lives and letting god have his way letting god reflect himself so that that original zoe life can be reflected through us and then my brother and sister god brings us to an expected end we'll close with this and i'm just going to quickly look for that slide i know i had it up before i just so i'm going to say put yourself in that picture now you might feel you're on a weed pile you might feel you're just an old stone that was rejected but i want to say it's okay you're in good company jesus was rejected that foundation stone was rejected but the bible says that stone that was rejected was made the head of the corner so it's okay to sometimes feel like we're on a wheat pile but my god lift your eyes of spiritual revelation up to see yourself in god's family album that god sees you perfect and know that god says to you and i want you to put your name in this now for i know the thoughts that i think toward you take your name in that thoughts of peace and not of evil and thoughts to give you an expected end that i am taking personal responsibility and i'm speaking on behalf of god now to bring you to god is not expecting you to bring you to an expected end he will bring you to his expected in for you for your attribute amen let's stand together maybe the musicians can come let's just pray together precious heavenly father o lord i have expressed the burden that was on my heart lord father i want to pray lord that if anything was misrepresented or misunderstood father that you will just let your holy spirit just guide it right to the right places father o lord jesus we so easily take our eyes off of where we come from so easily can fall into that place where we cannot remember father when we were shouting for joy oh lord jesus we don't hear from who you really are lord but i pray father that by your grace lord jesus that you will clean up those channels father lord jesus that you will give us eyes of revelation lord to look at your promises and trust you father to bring us to that expected end lord jesus oh father help us lord not to try and work ourselves up into it lord but to trust you and just take you at your word and believe it with simplistic childlike faith oh father just have your way in us lord i commit every word that was spoken into your hands i pray father that you will just continue to work with each one of us lord i also pray that you will bless this church bless brother chad and his dear wife and family lord i pray that you will bless every office bear a father you'll just keep them lord keep them standing keep them strong father and just continue to lead them and be with them and bless them lord father i thank you for your goodness tonight ask it in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen brother church of jesus christ today circumstances will be gone the word of god will still remain no sickness fear no guilt or have control and worry me the keys of faith are in my hand and i am bound for victory i am free my new day has come now i can be who i truly am i am free covered by his blood all things are possible with god all things are possible with god great commission from my lord i have now [Music] received will never have a part in me as amateur creator i can change the use atmosphere chains of circumstance for any spirit to be bound i am free my new day [Music] who i truly am i am free covered by his blood all things are possible with god [Music] things are possible with god oh i know that jesus is the same today the prophet came to show the light the bride must have it on display the hour has come for christ in us to be completely glorified i want the spirit to be free to do the greater works in me i am free my day has come now i can who i truly am i am free covered by his blood all things are possible with god all things are possible with god amen aren't you so thankful god knew before all that he was going to accomplish in you amen i was thinking as he talked about the thoughts of god amen the attributes of god which we are one of those thoughts and all of that moved into logos form when when the word moved into logos form if the attributes of god moved into logos form i was one of those attributes of god one of those thoughts of god and brother branham even said even when that logos was formed in the flesh he said when jesus was nailed to the cross amen there's something in you now that was in him there then praise god that was the seed that god is trying to bring to life to bear fruit say god let it bear fruit in me amen i was reminded when he was talking about the stones in the temple and then i just had a flashback to something that brother shimbo said last uh thanksgiving when brother shimbo was here preaching and he talked about michelangelo and the masterpiece he said michelangelo chose out amen a chosen piece of marble it was an elected chosen piece of marble and he said that michelangelo never created the marble into never created the marble into moses but he just with a predetermined vision in his mind knew that moses was in this stone all he had to do was knock off what wasn't moses what's god doing he's taking the word and he's knocking off what's not part of his original vision for you and i amen and tonight he was trying to show us i have a plan i know what's trapped inside that rock i know the place it fits i know the fruit i want that seed to bear just let the word come amen and nurture and draw out that life let the sword of the word knock off what's not part of the original vision and so that god's masterpiece can be on display i'm so thankful to be reminded it's not my plan it's his it's not the thought i had of myself amen i've had lots of thoughts of myself and most of them not good but it was the thought that he had and that thought that i'm expressing now that's the thought that matters so thankful god will remind us that in his original thinking there's a part of you and i that was there and god is now molding and shaping and drawing and nurturing to get this life to express what that thought was how many of you want to surrender more than ever before you know the potential you know what god wants what he needs is a surrendered vessel he doesn't need our efforts our efforts will fail he doesn't need our works our own works will fail what he needs is somebody who will surrender so that his works can produce his life so that his effort can fulfill his word i said god i want to be a yielded vessel that you can use man let's just bow our heads and thank god for his word lord jesus we thank you oh father we're so thankful that you touched our brother and you lord send an inspiration to him to remind us lord of the reality of our life we get so caught up lord in the things the natural things the the part lord that that's not even the part you want lord but god thank you for the reminder lord of what you're trying to do in our lives help us lord to stay yielded to you and surrendered to this word may we stay pliable in your hands lord may we be a vessel lord that you can shape that you can use that you can get glory out of god draw that life out of the seed that's inside of us bring forth that fruit that you predetermined before the foundation of the world god let me stay in your presence and ripen let me stay under the word amen and receive the nourishment the nurture the the vitamins that i need to produce this life chip away lord by the sword of your word every part of the stone that's not in your original vision so that we might reflect that vision that purpose that thought that you had before the foundation of the world god we're here to yield ourselves to you and surrender and may you take us and have preeminence in us to serve your purpose we love you father we pray that you would bless our brother our lord as he travels to other places i pray that you would bless him in his journey that you would refresh him strengthen him lord report back into him all that he's poured out and lord may he go back to his church back to his family refreshed rejuvenated and lord would you give him a fresh inspiration to carry home that his church and his wife and his daughter would be blessed lord when he returns we thank you for using him here tonight god we just want to surrender to the word that we heard and let it produce in us what you intended for it to do in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you all as you dismissed amen god
