[10:47] this afternoon we would
[10:48] very much appreciate that
[10:51] let's um
[10:52] take a look here at revelation chapter 4
[10:54] and i would like to begin reading in
[10:56] verse 1.
[10:58] after this i looked and behold a door
[11:00] was open in heaven and the first voice
[11:02] which i heard was as it were of a
[11:04] trumpet talking with me which said come
[11:06] up hither and i will show thee things
[11:09] which must be hereafter
[11:11] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[11:13] behold a throne was set in heaven
[11:15] and one sat on the throne
[11:18] you could have your seats may the lord
[11:20] ask rich
[11:21] at his blessing to the reading of his
[11:23] word
[11:24] and may he bless us as we move forward
[11:26] amen then
[11:27] i'd like to continue reading i'll read
[11:29] verse 3 again and continue from there
[11:31] and he that sat was to look upon like
[11:34] jasper and sardine stone and there was a
[11:36] rainbow round about the throne in sight
[11:38] like an m room and round about the
[11:40] throne were four and 20 seats and upon
[11:42] the seats i saw four and twenty elders
[11:44] sitting clothed in white raiment they
[11:46] had on their heads crowns of gold and
[11:49] out of the throne proceeded lightnings
[11:51] and thunderings and voices and there
[11:53] were seven lamps of fire burning before
[11:55] the throne which are the seven spirits
[11:57] of god
[11:58] and before the throne there was a sea of
[12:00] glass like unto crystal and in the midst
[12:02] of the throne and round about the throne
[12:04] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[12:06] behind
[12:07] and the first beast was like a lion and
[12:09] the second beast like a calf and the
[12:11] third beast had a face as a man and the
[12:13] fourth beast was like a flying eagle
[12:16] and the four beasts had each of them six
[12:18] wings about him and they were full of
[12:20] eyes within
[12:21] within and they rest not day and night
[12:24] saying holy holy holy lord god almighty
[12:27] which was and is and is to come
[12:30] and when these beasts give glory and
[12:32] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[12:34] throne who liveth forever and ever the
[12:36] four and twenty elders fall down before
[12:38] him that sat on the throne and worship
[12:40] him that liveth forever and ever and
[12:42] cast their crowns before the throne
[12:44] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[12:46] glory and honor and power for thou hast
[12:50] created all things and for thy pleasure
[12:52] they are and were created
[12:56] amen it was a long opening scripture
[12:58] reading but but there's a reason behind
[13:00] it amen and i
[13:02] i don't know how many knew but last week
[13:05] last friday morning and saturday morning
[13:08] i i was asked to do a minister's meeting
[13:11] for some brothers in india through zoom
[13:14] and so i'd never done that before i
[13:17] didn't really want to do that i just it
[13:19] makes me nervous to do something like
[13:21] that and so brother franco was good he
[13:23] helped me with that and pulled that off
[13:25] and it went really well
[13:27] and so when they asked me to do it i
[13:29] already had a busy weekend
[13:31] that last weekend and i thought that i
[13:34] was too busy to do it but when
[13:36] when he asked god dropped in my heart
[13:38] that i should do it so i knew that i was
[13:41] to do it and then then i asked him
[13:44] and i didn't ask him they told me what
[13:45] the subject was and they said the
[13:46] subject was church order
[13:49] and i thought church order
[13:51] there's so many fun things that we could
[13:53] talk about
[13:55] and so i was just for just for a brief
[13:58] moment i i was a little disappointed i
[14:01] thought you know there's so many things
[14:02] that are so exciting and so many end
[14:04] time things and so much of the book of
[14:06] revelation and and i was i was i was
[14:09] actually discouraged because god had
[14:10] already dropped in my heart i'm supposed
[14:11] to do this and they want me to do church
[14:13] order and i'm thinking
[14:15] don't you come
[14:17] be quiet in the sanctuary like
[14:20] there's got to be something funner than
[14:22] this
[14:23] but as i sat there i got off the phone
[14:25] it was it was it was like 12 30 to 1
[14:27] o'clock in the morning when i talked to
[14:29] brother rashaan and when i got off the
[14:30] phone all of a sudden
[14:32] inspiration started coming and my
[14:34] thoughts started lining up a certain way
[14:36] and god really just he really he was
[14:39] really gracious to me and all of a
[14:40] sudden i got a totally different
[14:42] perspective on church order and i taught
[14:45] it you know the way the lord had laid it
[14:48] on my heart taught it there that friday
[14:50] morning and that saturday morning of
[14:51] last week but i really had it on my
[14:54] heart to share it with you all because
[14:56] it was such a blessing for me you know
[14:58] how many times i i always ask the why
[15:00] behind the why like why why do these
[15:03] things matter why are they important why
[15:05] why did the prophet preach on it and
[15:07] teach on it there's a reason behind it
[15:09] and i feel like god started to line my
[15:11] thinking up and i got a bigger picture
[15:13] of church order so i'm actually not
[15:15] going to talk about church order i'm
[15:17] going to talk about the the the purpose
[15:19] behind it amen
[15:21] and i just titled this the word brings
[15:23] order and and when i begin to look here
[15:27] in revelation chapter 4 uh john he has a
[15:31] special privilege and in this privilege
[15:33] there's a door open in heaven and he he
[15:35] is allowed to go in and see the heavenly
[15:38] order in the throne room of god and we
[15:40] find out that the throne room of god is
[15:42] in order
[15:44] there's a certain order amen there's
[15:46] certain positions
[15:48] there's places
[15:50] there's offices
[15:52] there's jobs there's roles
[15:55] is that right
[15:56] so first i begin to see that heaven is
[15:59] an order there's a certain order to
[16:01] heaven and what god has done and what
[16:03] god has orchestrated is in order it's
[16:05] not in chaos but it's an order and every
[16:09] every created creature in heaven at
[16:11] least in this vision of the throne room
[16:13] we have everything is created for a
[16:16] purpose and it is serving its purpose in
[16:18] the throne room of god
[16:20] we have four living creatures they have
[16:22] a purpose we have 24 elders they have a
[16:24] purpose everything there that we have
[16:26] seven spirits of god before the throne
[16:28] they have a purpose so they have a
[16:30] position they have a place and they have
[16:32] a purpose and they're each one working
[16:34] according to their purpose
[16:36] but you realize that that that when we
[16:39] start to look at this and you start to
[16:41] look at seraphims and cherubims and
[16:43] angels of a heavenly host and order and
[16:45] rank and file and 24 elders and seven
[16:48] spirits of god and we start to see all
[16:51] that's there and all the positions and
[16:52] places one thing began to become evident
[16:56] to me that there's one focal point for
[16:58] everything and the focal point is the
[17:00] one who's sitting on the throne
[17:03] so every all the order and all the
[17:06] positions and all the roles everything
[17:09] is all centered around the one sitting
[17:12] on the throne so that the one sitting on
[17:15] the throne has
[17:16] preeminence and so everybody or every
[17:20] creature is operating in their role
[17:22] doing what they're supposed to do when
[17:24] they're supposed to do it as they're
[17:26] called to do it and it's all it's all
[17:29] bringing glory and honor to one and it's
[17:31] the one who sits on the throne so the
[17:33] focal point of heaven is the one sitting
[17:35] on the throne
[17:37] and everything is in order and at the
[17:40] pinnacle of that order you could say the
[17:41] center of the order or the pinnacle of
[17:44] the order however you want to hone it
[17:47] down it all comes to one and that's the
[17:49] one who sits on the throne
[17:52] so i begin to realize that earth has to
[17:55] be in order because heaven's in order
[17:58] because every this is supposed to be a
[18:00] reflection of heaven so the church must
[18:02] be in order amen because now he has a
[18:05] judgment seat he has a place where the
[18:07] one who sat on the throne there wants to
[18:09] sit on the throne in your heart amen he
[18:11] wants to rule and reign in this church
[18:13] and in order to do so there has to be an
[18:15] order amen because there was an order
[18:17] there there has to be an order here
[18:21] and so it needs to be a reflection
[18:25] and so
[18:26] if we can keep that in mind and begin to
[18:28] move from there let's go back to genesis
[18:36] yeah this little thought as it began to
[18:38] unfold as it unfolded in my heart as i
[18:41] went down through the scriptures
[18:43] it i just began to enjoy it so much
[18:47] and and i was so excited about bringing
[18:49] and sharing it with you today it's
[18:50] simple there's nothing complicated about
[18:52] it but for me it just put my heart in
[18:54] order
[18:55] it just straightened out my thinking
[18:57] and put everything in perspective and i
[18:59] enjoyed it so much
[19:01] so we're just going to walk through the
[19:02] bible this morning and look at god's
[19:04] order
[19:06] in genesis 1 verse 1 it says in the
[19:09] beginning god created the heaven and the
[19:11] earth
[19:13] and brother branham says now
[19:16] that everything in heaven in that
[19:18] constellation if one of those stars
[19:20] would move i know you go out at night
[19:22] and say i seen a star shoot no you've
[19:23] seen a weather light a star don't move
[19:25] if that star would move we would we
[19:27] would move with it everything in heaven
[19:30] is so much in harmony it holds one
[19:33] another together
[19:35] and something brother venom tells us
[19:37] that that god when god began to create
[19:40] the the heavenlies amen he says there
[19:43] was a great ball like sun and off of
[19:46] that would come a little clinker amen
[19:48] and he said it would keep moving and for
[19:50] thousands of years or however long it
[19:52] would move and move and finally he would
[19:54] say stop hold right there and it would
[19:56] stop and hold right there and another
[19:58] come off and another come on and he says
[20:00] what's he doing he's writing his first
[20:02] bible
[20:04] and brother branham tells us that each
[20:06] one of those uh heavenly bodies they
[20:09] differ one from another and the
[20:10] scripture tells us the same thing that
[20:12] they differ one from another in
[20:14] brightness and size and distance from
[20:17] the earth and perspective from our
[20:18] position but it was all for a purpose
[20:21] god wasn't doing anything random there
[20:23] was no chaos in the creation the
[20:25] creation was ordered it was ordered by
[20:27] the word of god and when god would speak
[20:30] it would begin to move when god would
[20:31] say stop it would stop when god told to
[20:33] hold its place it would hold its place
[20:35] and it became amen the word of god in
[20:38] manifestation because he's writing his
[20:40] first bible
[20:42] and brother ben tells us now if one of
[20:44] those would get out of place it would
[20:46] bring chaos upon the earth
[20:50] and when it brings chaos upon the earth
[20:52] he's saying it must hold its position it
[20:54] must hold its place but this is what he
[20:57] said he said everything in heaven is so
[20:59] much in harmony it holds one another
[21:01] together
[21:03] so that it means none of these bodies
[21:05] are independent from one another amen
[21:07] they're all holding each other in place
[21:10] and they're all amen in their position
[21:13] holding one another in position and what
[21:16] are they doing they're declaring the
[21:17] glory of god day by day night by night
[21:20] they are declaring the glory of god
[21:24] so if they would begin to move it would
[21:26] bring chaos
[21:28] he says in uh marriage and divorce we
[21:31] find out that everything in the
[21:32] beginning was running in perfect order
[21:34] and harmony with god nothing was out of
[21:37] cater
[21:38] everything in heaven is still in order
[21:40] all the stars the galaxies the solar
[21:42] system everything is perfectly in order
[21:44] and if one of them move it would
[21:46] interrupt the whole program
[21:48] that is so amazing because
[21:50] if you think about what was taking place
[21:52] in heaven when john saw the vision of
[21:54] the throne room of god amen what would
[21:57] happen if if one of the burners refused
[22:00] to be the burners the seraphim's the one
[22:02] that would took the coal off of the uh
[22:03] uh off the altar and go and touch the
[22:05] lips of the prophet isaiah what if one
[22:08] of the 24 elders tried to do that job
[22:10] and what if they were fighting over the
[22:11] tongues
[22:14] i want to do it no that's my job no i
[22:16] want to do it
[22:19] but see heaven is in order
[22:21] everybody has their place everybody has
[22:24] their position and they stay in place
[22:26] and there's a harmony around the throne
[22:28] of god and when there's a harmony around
[22:30] the throne of god there's true worship
[22:33] and it's reflecting the one who's being
[22:35] worshipped
[22:40] that's why if you worship in chaos what
[22:43] are we reflecting
[22:45] the one who's being worshipped
[22:48] what if the you know the the four living
[22:51] creatures were you know there's only
[22:53] three of them that day because the
[22:54] fourth one decided he was tired of
[22:56] saying holy holy holy
[22:59] every day holy holy holy and i'm tired
[23:01] and i want to go sit and he trades
[23:03] places 124 elders i want to sit on a
[23:05] seat for a while you go okay holy holy
[23:07] holy
[23:09] see it's it's funny to talk about it's
[23:11] nonsense to talk about but it's the
[23:12] reality
[23:14] they had to hold their positions so that
[23:16] god would be glorified and god was
[23:18] glorified their worship was reflecting
[23:20] back the glory of god
[23:24] let's go back to genesis chapter 1 again
[23:26] and let's continue reading
[23:29] in the beginning god created the heaven
[23:30] and the earth and the earth was without
[23:32] form and void and darkness was upon the
[23:34] face of the deep and the spirit of god
[23:36] moved upon the face of the waters so we
[23:39] find now brother of them tells us we
[23:40] find in genesis 1 2 we find earth in a
[23:44] state of judgment and brother remember
[23:46] said chaos
[23:48] state of chaos a state of judgment
[23:50] so when god created the earth he didn't
[23:52] create it in chaos we saw as brother
[23:55] benham shows us the ordering of the
[23:57] heavens amen they weren't created in
[23:59] chaos they were ordered step by step
[24:01] everything moved by the spoken word of
[24:03] god then it got in its position to do
[24:05] what god intended for it to do and it
[24:08] has to stay there or it brings the whole
[24:10] thing into disruption so now we find
[24:13] upon the earth the earth has been in
[24:16] chaos and now it's in a form of judgment
[24:20] and when we look at this and brother ben
[24:21] tells us that it was in chaos then you
[24:24] realize
[24:25] something happened between genesis 1 1
[24:27] and 1 2 because god didn't make it that
[24:30] way because the word of god does not
[24:31] bring chaos the word of god brings order
[24:34] so that's how brother branham knows and
[24:36] can allude to the fact that something
[24:38] happened upon the earth something
[24:40] happened that would bring chaos amen and
[24:43] something that would the only thing that
[24:45] i know that would bring chaos is when
[24:47] something got out of position with the
[24:48] word of god and began began a perversion
[24:51] of the word of god and when that
[24:53] happened it broke chaos and now judgment
[24:56] and now we find the earth in a state of
[24:58] judgment after chaos amen and the word
[25:01] of god now is going to go forth and it's
[25:03] going to turn the chaos into paradise
[25:06] and how's he going to use it he's going
[25:07] to order it by his word
[25:11] so when we stay with the word and the
[25:14] word has preeminence there's order amen
[25:17] when we leave the word amen things break
[25:19] out into chaos so when you see order
[25:22] amen you recognize that the word of god
[25:24] is bringing a certain order when you see
[25:26] the order disrupted you can recognize
[25:29] there's another something working to
[25:31] bring chaos in god's order
[25:36] he says verse 3
[25:38] and god said let there be light and
[25:40] there was light and god saw the light
[25:43] that it was good and god the light
[25:46] divided the light from the day
[25:48] and god called the light day and he
[25:50] called the darkness he called night and
[25:52] the evening and the morning were the
[25:53] first day and we're not going to keep
[25:55] reading through that because we know how
[25:57] he orders it but it's ordered by a
[25:59] spoken word and brother brahm tells us
[26:01] he's taking from chaos
[26:03] to eden to paradise to perfection by his
[26:07] spoken word
[26:10] let's go to chapter 2 verse 8.
[26:20] and the lord god
[26:22] planted a garden eastward in eden and
[26:24] there he put the man whom he had formed
[26:27] and out of the ground made the lord god
[26:29] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[26:31] the sight and good for food and the tree
[26:33] of life also in the midst of the garden
[26:35] and the tree of the knowledge of good
[26:36] and evil and a river went out of eden to
[26:39] water the garden from thence it was
[26:41] parted and became into four heads
[26:43] the name of the first is paisan which is
[26:47] that is which compasses the whole land
[26:49] of havala where there is gold and the
[26:51] gold of that land is good there's
[26:53] bedellium and onyx stone and the name of
[26:55] the second river is jihan and then and
[26:58] the same is the that compasses the whole
[27:00] land of ethiopia and the name of the
[27:02] third river is hedekel which is that
[27:04] which goeth toward the east of assyria
[27:06] in the fourth river as euphrates and the
[27:09] lord god took the man and put him into
[27:11] the garden of eden to dress it and to
[27:13] keep it
[27:14] so god
[27:16] created
[27:17] earth by a spoken word he created eden
[27:21] which was his pleasure and then he
[27:22] created the garden of eden and in the
[27:25] garden of eden he placed his man
[27:28] amen his creation a man in his own
[27:30] likeness after his own image and he
[27:33] places that man and he puts that man in
[27:35] authority over all of this creation he
[27:38] makes him a god upon the earth he is he
[27:41] is a son of god and now he's operating
[27:44] as god upon the earth and god gives him
[27:47] dominion over all the earth and he is
[27:49] told to dress it and to keep it
[27:52] is that right
[27:54] this man is told to dress it and to keep
[27:56] it and keep this word keep means to like
[28:00] to guard it amen like if there's a keep
[28:02] it's a place of safety like a prison is
[28:04] called a keep and he's here to keep it
[28:07] he's here to dress it and he's here to
[28:09] keep it and it's interesting that god
[28:12] tells this man who is made after his own
[28:14] image after his own likeness who's
[28:16] created and now he he puts him in a body
[28:19] of flesh so that he can be with the
[28:21] creation as a god over this creation so
[28:24] he can interact with the creation
[28:26] because we know at first he was like a
[28:27] spirit over it all like the holy spirit
[28:29] but now he's in flash to be with his
[28:32] creation and now with his creation
[28:34] interacting with the creation he's
[28:36] ordered to keep it
[28:39] so
[28:40] why why is he ordered to keep it amen
[28:44] it's interesting that god had already
[28:47] made a creation upon the earth
[28:50] and it's as if that creation wasn't kept
[28:54] something happened
[28:56] between genesis 1 1 and 1 2.
[28:59] what happened is still a mystery we
[29:01] don't know but something happened that
[29:03] threw it into chaos
[29:05] and i ask you every time something goes
[29:08] in the chaos what happened i'll tell you
[29:10] what happened something happened to the
[29:12] word
[29:14] somebody left the word or perverted the
[29:15] word or or did something to the word
[29:17] amen and it brought chaos and so now we
[29:20] know from from perfect perfect from the
[29:23] hand of god to chaos now spoken word
[29:25] brings it back into perfection and he
[29:27] puts his son over it all and tells him
[29:30] to to address it and to keep it so now
[29:33] the keeping of all of this is up to adam
[29:40] and brother brahm says in god's power to
[29:42] transform now the headquarters
[29:44] with his son and his son's bride over
[29:46] all it looks so perfect there was a man
[29:49] the head of it all his own son and his
[29:51] bride and every seed was perfect the
[29:53] palms and and the oaks and the grass and
[29:56] the birds and the animals and everything
[29:57] was in perfect order with the
[29:59] commandment of god
[30:01] what was keeping it in perfect order the
[30:03] word when god said you're a this that's
[30:06] what it always was a palm tree was
[30:07] always a palm tree there was no
[30:09] hybridization until man got involved a
[30:11] hybrid and it was an order according to
[30:13] the commandment of god
[30:15] and man was told to address it and keep
[30:17] it let's look at
[30:19] chapter 2 verse 16.
[30:22] and the lord god commanded the man
[30:24] saying every tree of the garden thou
[30:25] mayest freely eat but of the tree of
[30:27] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[30:29] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[30:30] eatest thereof thou shall surely die
[30:35] so man was told to dress the garden and
[30:38] keep it and he did so for a period of
[30:40] time we don't know how long that was
[30:43] where he is god upon the earth he kept
[30:45] it under the order of god's word amen he
[30:48] kept it under the commandment of god but
[30:50] he was he was given a commandment he was
[30:53] given a church order
[30:56] all right
[30:57] the church order in the garden of eden
[30:59] was you may eat of every tree but of
[31:01] this tree you may not eat of that and so
[31:04] adam was given a church order and the
[31:06] church order was for a purpose amen and
[31:08] that and that purpose was to keep the
[31:11] word preeminent
[31:13] because we know what that tree of
[31:14] knowledge and good and evil was and we
[31:16] know what it did and what it did was
[31:18] corrupt the word of god so the church
[31:20] order was to bring preeminence back to
[31:22] the word
[31:23] and keep the word in preeminence keep
[31:26] the word and rulership over it all amen
[31:29] but a serpent would come anointed of the
[31:31] devil to beguile the woman and begin to
[31:34] entice her to take of that tree what was
[31:36] she doing she was breaking her church
[31:38] order
[31:40] and so now we're not talking about
[31:42] chewing gum friends
[31:45] now we're talking about amen everything
[31:47] was centered everything in heaven there
[31:50] was a focal point in heaven and it was
[31:51] the one who sat on the throne amen and
[31:54] he was the word the word it was god the
[31:57] word was with god amen god was the
[31:58] originator of the word the word emanated
[32:00] from god and in the heavenly throne room
[32:02] he's the focal point of the whole order
[32:04] all the order points back to him and all
[32:07] the order reflects him
[32:09] and now on earth there's a creation in
[32:11] the heavens and on earth that is
[32:12] reflecting his nature reflecting his
[32:15] character and it's ordered by his word
[32:17] and now he has a son that's to reflect
[32:19] his character to reflect his nature and
[32:21] that son is given an order to keep and
[32:23] that son now fails to keep the order and
[32:26] when he fails to keep the order what
[32:28] happened to perfection amen perfection
[32:31] was broken hybridization entered in
[32:33] chaos broke out upon the earth and we
[32:36] are looking at the effects of it now in
[32:38] 2021 we are looking at the effects of
[32:40] adam not keeping it in order
[32:45] it was all ordered to the commandments
[32:47] of god but when man let down on the word
[32:49] amen what happened chaos began to set in
[32:52] and what god had built to continue on
[32:55] begins to decay what god had built to
[32:57] last amen and doesn't last anymore amen
[33:00] now it falls into ruin and it begins to
[33:02] decay because man didn't keep his church
[33:05] order
[33:07] praise god
[33:08] i hope by the time we get done with this
[33:10] church order is going to make so much
[33:11] sense that nobody has to tell us
[33:13] anything anymore
[33:15] we just understand why god orders things
[33:17] the way he orders them
[33:19] now after chaos is broke out amen what
[33:22] eve did not understand
[33:24] that day when she was being enticed to
[33:26] take her that tree she couldn't
[33:28] understand what was wrong with it it
[33:30] looked good it was good to make you wise
[33:32] it was good for food like she and
[33:34] herself could not discern what was wrong
[33:36] with that thing but god had told her to
[33:38] stay away from it amen but her
[33:40] discernment failed her intellect failed
[33:42] her her wisdom her eyesight her senses
[33:45] they all failed her and when she failed
[33:48] to keep the church order when she failed
[33:49] to keep the word amen chaos broke out
[33:52] and i can imagine after she realizes the
[33:55] the extent of that fall and what it
[33:57] would cost her and as she brings more
[34:00] child and pain how she has to be clothed
[34:02] her husband now has to earn bread by the
[34:04] sweat of his brow she watches one son
[34:07] slay another son how long did it take
[34:09] before she realized i should have kept
[34:11] the church order
[34:13] i should have kept the word because the
[34:16] the order is always about keeping the
[34:18] word in preeminence that if there's
[34:20] nothing else you catch today i want you
[34:22] to catch this the order of god is about
[34:24] keeping the word in preeminence
[34:27] the order in heaven was about keeping
[34:28] the one on the throne and preeminence
[34:30] the order on earth was about keeping the
[34:32] the one who gave the word and
[34:33] preeminence and now the order that we
[34:36] walk under amen is to keep that word in
[34:38] preeminence
[34:42] and when they failed
[34:44] everything fell
[34:46] under his jurisdiction
[34:48] and the world has been going back
[34:52] into chaos
[34:55] if you read the papers and look at the
[34:57] news and realize that we're in chaos
[35:01] the world is in chaos
[35:03] and why is it in chaos it has nothing to
[35:06] do with a pandemic
[35:09] it has everything from leaving god's
[35:10] order
[35:12] we're in chaos because we left god's
[35:14] order and man is so rapidly leaving the
[35:17] order of god's word that chaos is
[35:19] breaking out everywhere there's no
[35:21] restraints anymore there's no hold on it
[35:23] anymore chaos is rampant amen what you
[35:26] look at the chaos and the chaos and
[35:28] governments the chaos and finance the
[35:30] chaos and medicine i mean everything is
[35:33] just chaotic amen nothing is stable
[35:35] anymore
[35:36] there there's no place of stability
[35:39] there's nothing that's sure we have no
[35:41] confidence that things will be tomorrow
[35:42] like they are today amen everything is
[35:45] shifting everything is moving everything
[35:47] is fluid nothing is solid anymore
[35:50] you agree with that in the world's
[35:52] perspective from the world's perspective
[35:54] everything is moving amen in it it's a
[35:57] direct correlation with leaving the
[35:58] order of god because if you stay with
[36:01] the order of god's word you have a firm
[36:03] foundation you have a solid rock to
[36:04] stand upon amen my word will not return
[36:07] to me void it'll accomplish that which i
[36:08] said there's a definite purpose like you
[36:10] stay with the word of god and you stay
[36:12] with the order of god things don't shift
[36:14] things don't change things don't move
[36:16] the storm comes they beat against the
[36:18] house but the house doesn't move because
[36:20] it's founded upon a rock
[36:24] that's why the church was supposed to be
[36:25] based on a rock founded upon a rock the
[36:28] rock of revelation of who jesus christ
[36:30] is
[36:31] because that doesn't move it doesn't
[36:32] change with the times it doesn't shift
[36:36] so
[36:37] so the order
[36:39] brought stability
[36:42] the order that god placed the mother
[36:45] brought security
[36:48] the order that they were placed on him
[36:49] provided everything for them
[36:52] because the order kept the word in
[36:53] preeminence and the word and preeminence
[36:56] kept everything in order
[36:59] but when they failed to keep the word in
[37:01] preeminence everything fell out of order
[37:06] let's turn to numbers
[37:08] chapter 2.
[37:21] like i said i just want to roll through
[37:22] the bible i don't want to stay in any
[37:24] one place too long there's many points
[37:26] that we want to hit
[37:27] so just keep your bibles handy
[37:30] and we'll turn some pages
[37:32] and march through as the lord leads
[37:36] numbers chapter 2
[37:38] verse 1
[37:40] and the lord spake unto moses and unto
[37:42] aaron saying every man of the children
[37:44] of israel shall pitch by his own
[37:46] standard with the inside of their
[37:48] father's house far
[37:49] off about the tabernacle of the
[37:51] congregation shall they pitch and on the
[37:53] east side toward the rising of the sun
[37:55] shall they of the standard of the camp
[37:57] of judah pitch throughout their armies
[38:00] and nation the son of
[38:01] amin of them shall be captain of the
[38:03] children of judah
[38:05] and his hosts and those that are
[38:07] numbered of them were three scorer and
[38:08] 14 and 600 and those that do pitch next
[38:13] unto them shall be the tribe of issachar
[38:15] and nathaniel the son of azur shall be
[38:18] captain of the children of issachar and
[38:20] his hosts and those that are were
[38:22] numbered thereof were 50 or were 50 and
[38:24] 4 thousand and 400 then the tribe of
[38:27] zebulun and the iliad the son of helan
[38:30] shall be captain of the children of
[38:31] zebulun and his hosts and those that
[38:34] were numbered there were fifty and seven
[38:36] thousand
[38:37] and four hundred and all that were
[38:39] numbered in the camp of judah were a
[38:41] hundred thousand and four score thousand
[38:42] and six thousand and four hundred
[38:44] throughout their armies these shall
[38:46] first set forth so i don't want to go on
[38:49] and read because there's a lot of
[38:50] details i just wanted to read the first
[38:51] part so you caught how many details
[38:53] there were there
[38:54] there's no quiz so i'm not going to ask
[38:55] any questions but here we have moses in
[38:58] the exodus he's bringing a people amen a
[39:01] people that had a promise children of
[39:03] abraham with a promise that was given to
[39:05] abraham that they shall have a land but
[39:07] they according to the word they were so
[39:09] joining in a strange land for 400 years
[39:12] but this was the time of them being
[39:13] delivered with a mighty hand and god was
[39:16] moving them out of slavery he's moving
[39:19] them as a people and he was calling out
[39:21] a people and he brought them into the
[39:23] wilderness but when he brought them into
[39:25] the wilderness he has a prophet there
[39:27] and he tells that prophet to order the
[39:29] people
[39:30] there was now can you imagine when they
[39:32] first moved out amen these people were
[39:35] living in goshen they were they had been
[39:37] slaves they were in bondage they had
[39:40] first liberty and freedom and they lost
[39:42] liberties and they lost more liberties
[39:43] and they lost more freedoms until they
[39:45] became in bondage and became they came
[39:47] into slavery amen under the system of
[39:49] egypt but now god is bringing them out
[39:52] of that system and as he brings them out
[39:54] of that system and then when they first
[39:56] walk out amen they're a ragtag group of
[39:59] people and they've got whatever animals
[40:01] they could grab whatever they had
[40:02] whatever they borrowed off of neighbors
[40:04] they borrowed all kinds of vessels and
[40:05] pots and instruments and gold and silver
[40:07] and raymen and they were grabbing the
[40:09] spoils out of egypt and they were
[40:10] throwing it over their shoulders their
[40:12] children's shoulders on their ox car
[40:14] who knows how they carried it or how
[40:16] they went out but they went out they met
[40:18] a multitude of people amen they didn't
[40:20] have a standard they didn't have a
[40:22] marching order they didn't have a
[40:23] structure they were just people that
[40:25] went forth in the exodus and they get
[40:27] out into the wilderness and and how do
[40:29] they camp i mean when you go out there
[40:31] in the wilderness i guess everybody just
[40:32] pitched a tit wherever they felt like
[40:34] pitching a tent
[40:37] and you know these are they're all mixed
[40:39] up and they have tents everywhere and i
[40:41] mean there there's probably no grid
[40:44] pattern
[40:45] so you can walk between them nicely i
[40:47] mean it wasn't laid out like a city
[40:49] planter would like to see it laid out
[40:52] but god would not allow that to stay in
[40:55] chaos because now he was bringing a
[40:57] people out and these were his chosen
[40:59] people and this nation was going to
[41:01] reflect him
[41:03] and so god tells moses you structure the
[41:06] people and he goes down to the details
[41:09] this is the one he'll camp on the
[41:11] east side there'll be two tribes that
[41:13] will camp with him amen there'll be
[41:15] another chief amend standard that will
[41:18] that will be on the west side and the
[41:20] south and the north and there'll be two
[41:21] tribes that go with them the levites
[41:23] will be here they will be set up in this
[41:25] pattern when they break camp the first
[41:27] one to go forth with judah after them
[41:29] will be this group and after them with
[41:30] his this group when they go to battle
[41:32] they'll go in this order amen when you
[41:33] pitch the tent you'll pitch it this way
[41:36] when you set up the tabernacle first
[41:38] you'll do this and second you'll do that
[41:40] and third you'll do that and you'll do
[41:42] it in a certain order amen then you'll
[41:44] camp in a certain order and you'll be
[41:46] structured in a certain way
[41:49] and and can you imagine the first day
[41:52] that the instructions go out and
[41:53] everybody's trying to find oh now
[41:55] everybody in judah's got to get together
[41:57] there's there's only about 2 million or
[41:58] so people i mean this can't be real
[42:00] difficult
[42:04] and some of judah was with israel and
[42:05] they were just scattered now now after
[42:08] the commandment comes they've got to all
[42:09] come they've got to congregate together
[42:11] there's a captain over them and this
[42:12] captain i tell you what i wouldn't want
[42:15] to be that captain that day
[42:18] who wants to be in charge of this mess
[42:21] we got to get no no you come over here
[42:22] no you you're not here you're over there
[42:25] what are you doing i've already told you
[42:31] but god told moses and moses had to get
[42:32] the people and he got the captain of
[42:34] each tribe and in position and they gave
[42:36] the orders and the orders have to go
[42:38] from the top down and when you get done
[42:41] and you have the tabernacle in the
[42:42] middle you've got the outer court you've
[42:44] got the holy place you've got the holy
[42:46] of holies everything's structured the
[42:48] mercy seats in place the levites are
[42:50] there to serve amen and then when you
[42:52] look down from heaven you've got the
[42:54] lion the ox and the man and the eagle
[42:56] you've got the same thing on earth
[42:58] that's reflecting what's in heaven and
[43:00] they're all round about the throne of
[43:02] god that's now on earth in that
[43:03] tabernacle
[43:06] god ordered by his word and the ordering
[43:10] of the nation of israel was reflecting
[43:13] the throne room in heaven and that order
[43:15] put the central focus of the entire camp
[43:18] of israel on the one who sits upon the
[43:20] throne
[43:21] it made the word preeminent it made the
[43:24] word giver preeminent it put god in his
[43:27] place when they got an order
[43:29] so there was a church order in eden that
[43:31] put god in this place there was a church
[43:33] order in the wilderness that put god in
[43:36] its place i hope you're starting to see
[43:38] church order is not about chewing gum
[43:40] and talking in church it's about giving
[43:41] the word preeminence it's about putting
[43:43] god in his place
[43:50] he ordered the service of the tabernacle
[43:52] they couldn't just worship god any way
[43:54] they wanted to worship god
[43:58] everything was set to match the throne
[44:00] room
[44:03] there was an approach to god
[44:08] and it was all crying holiness unto the
[44:10] lord
[44:14] and the levites
[44:16] had to be chosen not anybody could do
[44:18] what they were to do
[44:20] and certain levites were ordered to
[44:22] certain things and one family of the
[44:24] family of aaron was ordered to be the
[44:26] priest and then the high priest nobody
[44:28] could take anybody else's place
[44:30] everybody had to do it the way god said
[44:32] and when we did it the way god said amen
[44:35] they saw the pillar of fire they saw the
[44:37] cloud they saw the presence of god is in
[44:40] the camp why because they got the church
[44:42] order right and when they got the order
[44:44] right it put amen the focus upon the one
[44:48] who's sitting on the throne and his
[44:50] presence remained among them as long as
[44:52] they kept it right
[44:55] praise god
[44:56] let's go to first kings chapter 10.
[45:12] first kings chapter 10.
[45:27] first kings 10 and 4
[45:31] and when the queen of sheba has seen all
[45:34] solomon's wisdom
[45:36] and the house that he built
[45:38] and the meat of his table and the
[45:39] sitting of his servants and the
[45:40] attendants of his ministers and their
[45:42] apparel and his cup bearers and his
[45:44] ascent by which he went up into the
[45:46] house of the lord there was no more
[45:48] spirit in her
[45:51] and she said to the king it was a true
[45:53] report that i heard in my own land of
[45:55] thy acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i
[45:58] believe not the words until i came and
[46:00] mine eyes had seen it and behold the
[46:02] half was not told me thy wisdom and my
[46:04] prosperity exceeded the fame which i
[46:06] heard happy are thy men happy are these
[46:09] thy servants which stand continually
[46:11] before thee and that hear thy wisdom
[46:15] here comes the queen of sheba amen
[46:17] brother baby said the heathen queen
[46:18] she's now coming in and solomon here his
[46:21] ministry at the pinnacle of of his
[46:23] kingdom amen it's a type of jesus christ
[46:27] in the millennium when he takes the
[46:28] throne of david and orders it in the
[46:30] millennium and you have to ask yourself
[46:31] what will the millennium be like will it
[46:33] be chaos or will it be order
[46:36] there'll be a church order in the
[46:38] millennium
[46:39] we know there's a church order because
[46:41] if egypt does not come at the feast of
[46:43] tabernacles they'll not get any rain
[46:46] so there's a church order even over in
[46:48] the millennium
[46:51] so now solomon is here and solomon under
[46:55] solomon's ministry he puts everything in
[46:58] order
[47:00] and when the queen of sheba sees
[47:02] the cup bearers
[47:04] and and the attendants
[47:07] and the servants and the apparel in the
[47:10] house and the order and she sees what is
[47:12] she looking at she's looking at
[47:14] everything this is what god had raised
[47:16] up a kingdom for amen to reflect him he
[47:20] had solomon on the throne which was a
[47:21] son of david which was the son of god he
[47:24] was reflecting the coming kingdom amen
[47:26] it was a reflection of god's order and
[47:28] solomon amen before he fell away he
[47:31] comes to this pinnacle amen of an
[47:33] expression of what god wanted to express
[47:36] giving the word preeminence in every way
[47:38] and when he did a minute took her breath
[47:40] away there was no more spirit in her
[47:42] when she saw how ordered everything was
[47:45] there was no chaos in the kingdom of
[47:47] solomon
[47:48] there was no chaos in his house there
[47:50] was no chaos with his attendance and he
[47:52] said happier the men that serve happier
[47:55] these that get to hear thy wisdom they
[47:57] were all in place they were all in
[47:59] position they were all doing something
[48:02] for the king amen and they were happy in
[48:04] their service
[48:07] and when she saw everybody in position
[48:10] everybody in place she saw the way they
[48:13] served they it was perfect amen solomon
[48:17] i'll tell you i don't think solomon had
[48:18] the guy with two left hands and five
[48:20] thumbs on each hand he probably wasn't
[48:22] the one serving him a cup
[48:25] it wasn't the guy who spilled a drink
[48:27] every time he filled it
[48:32] the queen of sheba wouldn't have had no
[48:34] more spirit in her she would have
[48:35] probably been like this is nuts
[48:38] this is chaos
[48:40] if the wrong one was in the wrong
[48:41] position and there wasn't order and they
[48:43] didn't serve on time and the meal was
[48:45] laid and the food was cold and the
[48:47] apparel wasn't in the right order and
[48:49] somebody had to quickly jump in somebody
[48:51] else's position to pull off the meal
[48:55] just think about what's being said and
[48:58] think that solomon had his kingdom in
[49:00] order and when the the order of the
[49:02] kingdom amen when queen of sheba came
[49:05] and she saw the structure the order amen
[49:08] the way they served there was no more
[49:10] spirit in her and she said i heard of
[49:11] thy fame i heard of thy reputation but
[49:13] the half was not told onto me this is
[49:15] something you have to see amen
[49:18] i heard about it but this is amazing and
[49:20] of course the queen of sheba would
[49:21] understand what it would take to get
[49:23] attendance like that to get service like
[49:25] this to get everything running smooth
[49:27] she was a
[49:28] queen when this queen saw the order of
[49:32] this king's court in his home amen she
[49:35] had no more spirit in her she was the
[49:37] one who could testify this is beyond
[49:40] what a man can do this is unbelievable
[49:46] solomon had order
[49:50] i'd like quickly to flip over to
[49:52] chronicles and look at chronicles and
[49:54] then come back
[49:56] he said i'm not going to preach a long
[49:58] time on any of these i'm going to hit
[49:59] several things several examples and keep
[50:01] moving because you could stay on each
[50:03] one of these a long long time and we've
[50:04] preached on these before and spent ben
[50:06] spent hours on them
[50:09] like brother ben said you can take just
[50:10] one of those seals and go around and
[50:12] around that clock
[50:14] but i just want to hit these things and
[50:16] move
[50:17] first chronicles 15
[50:22] and verse 11.
[50:25] when we get to this part
[50:26] of of chronicles first chronicles 15
[50:30] verse 11 david had already tried to
[50:33] bring the ark of the covenant to him
[50:35] he brought it on ox carts and
[50:38] when
[50:39] it the oxen had stumbled and the cart
[50:42] had rocked uzziah yuza had put his hand
[50:44] to steady and he was smitten dead and
[50:47] david calls a cancellation to the whole
[50:49] works and he puts it on hold and now
[50:51] he's gonna come back and now it's time
[50:54] to try it again and he says in verse 11
[50:57] and david called for zodiac and abby
[50:58] athar the priest and for the levites for
[51:01] urel assaya and joelle shemiyah and
[51:04] elial and
[51:06] aminadab and said unto them
[51:09] you are the chief of the fathers of the
[51:11] levite sanctify yourselves both ye and
[51:13] your brethren that you may bring up the
[51:15] ark of the lord god of israel unto the
[51:17] place that i have prepared for him
[51:19] for because i did it not at the first
[51:22] the lord our god made a breach upon us
[51:25] for that we sought him not after the dew
[51:28] order
[51:30] so the priests and the levites
[51:32] sanctified themselves to bring up the
[51:33] ark of the lord god of israel and the
[51:36] children of the levites bear the ark of
[51:37] god upon their shoulders with the staves
[51:39] thereof as moses commanded according to
[51:42] the word of the lord
[51:43] and david spake to the chief of the
[51:45] levites to appoint their brethren to be
[51:47] the singers with instruments and music
[51:49] sultries and harps and symbols sounding
[51:52] by lifting up their voice
[51:54] with joy
[51:56] david had recognized
[51:59] his desire was right
[52:01] his sincerity was right
[52:04] what he was wanting to accomplish was
[52:06] right
[52:08] but he says here
[52:10] that we sought him not after the dew
[52:13] order
[52:15] and the due order was for the levites to
[52:18] carry the ark but he had put it on a
[52:19] cart because it came back to them on a
[52:21] cart from the philistines so because the
[52:23] philistines had done it that way and it
[52:25] got there they just continued what the
[52:27] philistines were doing and they had to
[52:28] stop and go back to what moses had
[52:31] instructed and then and david was just
[52:33] carrying it on the way that it came to
[52:35] him and and somebody had died in the
[52:37] process but he says we didn't do it
[52:39] according to the due order and because
[52:41] it wasn't according to the due order
[52:43] amen it brought chaos it brought death
[52:45] something didn't work right
[52:47] so now he backs it up and says let's do
[52:50] it according to the do order and now
[52:53] there was rejoicing now there was
[52:55] singing now because god wants things in
[52:58] order amen he wants his church in order
[52:59] he wants his people in order amen he
[53:01] wants you and i in order brother and
[53:03] sister
[53:04] he wants us amen he wants us to do what
[53:07] we were called to do he wants us to do
[53:09] what we've been predestinated to do he
[53:11] wants us to be amen the cup bearer and
[53:13] the attendant and the and all the things
[53:15] that that was in solomon's temple
[53:18] so he learned david learned that it must
[53:21] be done
[53:22] and do order even though the desire is
[53:24] right and and the motive is right it's
[53:26] got to be right first kings let's go
[53:29] back to first kings chapter 7.
[53:45] verse 48
[53:52] first kings 7 48 and solomon made all
[53:55] the vessels that pertained into the
[53:56] house of the lord in the altar of gold
[53:58] and the table of gold whereupon the shoe
[54:00] bread was
[54:02] and the candlesticks of pure gold five
[54:03] on the right and five on the left before
[54:06] the oracle with the flowers and the
[54:07] lamps and the tongs of gold and the
[54:10] bowls and the snuffers and the basins
[54:12] and the spoons and the sensors of pure
[54:14] gold and the hinges of gold both for the
[54:16] doors of the inner house the most holy
[54:18] place and for the doors of the house to
[54:19] wit of the temple
[54:21] so was ended all the work that king
[54:23] solomon made for the house of the lord
[54:24] and solomon brought in the things which
[54:27] david his father had dedicated even the
[54:29] silver and gold and the vessels that he
[54:31] put among the treasures of the house of
[54:33] the lord
[54:35] i read this for a reason because i
[54:37] wanted you to see
[54:38] when it come time for solomon to build
[54:41] the temple or yeah build the temple of
[54:43] god amen david wanted to build it but
[54:46] solomon had to do it he was the one
[54:48] commissioned to do it and so he he
[54:50] builds it but when he builds it there's
[54:52] so many things that have to be in place
[54:56] things that we don't think about we
[54:58] think about putting the stones in place
[55:00] and getting the curtains in place and
[55:01] the big pieces of furniture but he's got
[55:03] to do spoons and snuffers and bowls and
[55:06] this and this and this and this and this
[55:09] and solomon has to work and get
[55:11] everything in its place because when it
[55:13] comes to the temple worship there's a
[55:15] lot of pieces
[55:17] there's a lot of instruments there's a
[55:19] lot of tools there's a lot of things and
[55:21] everything has to be done and everything
[55:24] has to be put in order solomon wasn't
[55:26] marching forward and say hey we got the
[55:28] building done let's just go ahead and
[55:30] start having church he had to get the
[55:32] bowls and the snuffers and the and he
[55:34] was in the pipes and he's not saying ah
[55:36] it's just a snuffer i mean we'll find
[55:38] something to use until we get it done
[55:42] you see there was a certain order there
[55:44] was certain structure there was an order
[55:46] of the lord and everything had to go in
[55:48] the right order and when it went in the
[55:49] right order we're going to find that god
[55:51] blessed it very much let's look over at
[55:53] verse 8 chapter 1.
[55:57] then solomon assembled the elders of
[55:59] israel and all the heads of the tribes
[56:01] of the chief of the fathers of the
[56:02] children of israel and king solomon in
[56:04] jerusalem that they might bring up the
[56:06] ark of the covenant of the lord of the
[56:08] city of david which is zion
[56:11] and all the men of israel assembled
[56:12] themselves into king solomon at the
[56:14] feast in the month of ethnim which is
[56:17] the seventh month
[56:18] and all the elders of israel came and
[56:21] the priests took up the ark then they
[56:23] brought up the ark of the lord and the
[56:24] tabernacle of the congregation and all
[56:26] the holy vessels that were in the
[56:28] tabernacle even those did the priest and
[56:30] the levites bring up and king solomon
[56:32] and all the congregation of israel that
[56:34] were assembled unto him were with him
[56:36] before the ark sacrificing sheep and
[56:38] oxen that could not be told nor numbered
[56:41] for multitude and the priest brought in
[56:43] the ark of the covenant of the lord and
[56:45] to the place and to the oracle the house
[56:48] to the most holy place even under the
[56:50] wings of the cherubims
[56:52] for the cherubims spread forth their two
[56:54] wings over the place of the ark and the
[56:56] cherubims covered the ark and the staves
[56:58] thereof above and they drew out the
[57:00] staves that the ends of the staves were
[57:02] seen out in the holy place before the
[57:03] oracle and they were not seen without
[57:06] and there they are unto this day
[57:08] there was nothing in the ark say the two
[57:10] tables of stone which moses put there at
[57:12] horeb when the lord made a covenant with
[57:15] the children of israel when they came
[57:17] out of the land of egypt and it came to
[57:19] pass when the priests were coming out of
[57:21] the holy place that the cloud filled the
[57:23] house of the lord so that the priest
[57:25] could not stand to minister because of
[57:27] the cloud for the glory of the lord had
[57:29] filled the house of the lord
[57:32] solomon that spends a long time if you
[57:34] read it there's a lot that goes into
[57:36] this building they meant all the stones
[57:38] were hewn off-site they meant so it was
[57:40] quiet in place every stone was shaped
[57:43] differently but had a place that it
[57:44] fitted we had a predetermined place to
[57:46] fit
[57:47] it was already made to fit and it was
[57:49] predetermined where it would fit and
[57:51] when it come together it made and that's
[57:53] a type of the church of god amen we're
[57:55] living stones lively stones built into a
[57:57] spiritual habitation of god and gone by
[58:00] us shaped different amen with different
[58:02] gifts different abilities different
[58:04] makeups god is piecing us together to
[58:06] make this tabernacle but there's a lot
[58:08] that goes to it amen there's a lot of
[58:10] pieces there's a lot of word that comes
[58:12] together
[58:14] and solomon if you read it there's a lot
[58:16] i mean he's working and he's laboring
[58:18] and they're getting this and they've got
[58:19] to get timber from a certain place in
[58:21] stones from another it all has to come
[58:23] together i mean we think we have supply
[58:25] chain issues today i think solomon had
[58:27] supply chain issues
[58:29] but he was able to solve them and
[58:31] everything came together then on the
[58:33] tabernacle was built and they made every
[58:35] little intricate piece everything was
[58:36] woven just right the tapestry was right
[58:39] the the instruments were right they were
[58:41] in the right place there was nothing out
[58:43] of place amen
[58:45] he didn't have the snuffer where the
[58:46] bowl goes in the bowl where he had it
[58:48] all when he got it all in place and
[58:49] everything was right and when they come
[58:51] and they put the word back in place amen
[58:54] when the word took the central spot when
[58:56] the word took the chief see when they
[58:58] brought the word with the two tables of
[59:00] stone and the ark and put god's seat
[59:02] back in place over the word amen the
[59:04] glory of the lord came and filled the
[59:06] place
[59:09] so that they couldn't minister well they
[59:11] couldn't minister anymore
[59:13] that was the goal of building the whole
[59:15] thing in the first place so that god
[59:17] could come in and god could fill his
[59:19] house so the presence of god would be
[59:21] amongst them the ministers weren't
[59:22] disappointed when they couldn't minister
[59:24] anymore
[59:26] that was the whole point of ordering
[59:28] everything was for god god was so
[59:30] pleased when everything was done he
[59:32] brought his presence in and the cloud
[59:34] filled the place and so the ministers
[59:36] had to leave amen god was there what got
[59:39] him there amen they kept the order of
[59:42] the lord they did it according to the
[59:44] way they were told everything was
[59:46] brought in place and it all went back to
[59:48] preeminence to the word and when the
[59:50] word got the preeminent spot in the
[59:52] entire structure god came down
[59:57] that's the point of our church order
[59:59] friends the point of our church order
[1:00:01] every one of us and everything we do and
[1:00:03] when we come to church the way we come
[1:00:05] the way we dress the way we sing the way
[1:00:07] we approach everything we do it's all
[1:00:10] for one purpose so that every vessel
[1:00:12] every tool every piece of instrument
[1:00:14] every servant can get in the right place
[1:00:16] so that we can put the word in
[1:00:17] preeminence and we work the word in
[1:00:19] preeminence god will bless us with his
[1:00:21] presence
[1:00:24] the order it wasn't about a snuffer amen
[1:00:27] the snuffer was part of it but it wasn't
[1:00:29] the snuffer amen it wasn't the priest he
[1:00:32] was part of it but it wasn't the priest
[1:00:35] it wasn't the stone that was part of it
[1:00:37] but it wasn't stone the whole thing had
[1:00:39] to come together because the whole point
[1:00:41] was this has to be a dwelling place for
[1:00:43] god almighty and god won't dwell until
[1:00:46] everything's in place
[1:00:51] praise god
[1:00:53] let's go to first kings 18.
[1:01:06] first kings 18.
[1:01:12] verse 30.
[1:01:16] this is elijah of mount carmon
[1:01:19] and elijah said unto all the people come
[1:01:21] near unto me and all the people came
[1:01:23] near unto him and he repaired the altar
[1:01:26] of the lord that was broken down
[1:01:28] and elijah took 12 stones according to
[1:01:30] the number of the tribes of the son of
[1:01:32] jacob unto whom the lord the word of the
[1:01:34] lord came saying israel shall be thy
[1:01:36] name
[1:01:37] and with the stones he built an altar in
[1:01:39] the name of the lord
[1:01:40] and he made a trench about the altar as
[1:01:42] great as would contain two measures of
[1:01:44] seed and he put the wood in order
[1:01:50] he didn't throw the wood up there
[1:01:54] if we just pause for a minute
[1:01:56] he didn't take 10 stones
[1:01:59] 11 stones
[1:02:01] 13 stones
[1:02:03] he took the right number of
[1:02:04] stones and he rebuilt the altar of the
[1:02:07] lord he was bringing it back to its
[1:02:09] original condition
[1:02:11] because the elijah ministry brings us
[1:02:13] back to the original word
[1:02:16] and this elijah brings back the order of
[1:02:18] the 12 tribes our elijah brought back
[1:02:21] the order of the seven church ages
[1:02:25] so this one's working with a nation the
[1:02:26] next one's working with the church
[1:02:29] and he rebuilds he brings back to its
[1:02:31] former state he's re he's getting it
[1:02:34] back in order
[1:02:37] he's putting the altar he's restoring
[1:02:39] worship back properly he brings it back
[1:02:41] to the right order he gets the right
[1:02:43] number of stones and i believe he put
[1:02:45] him in the right spot that's me the
[1:02:48] bible doesn't say that but i believe he
[1:02:50] got him in the right spot
[1:02:52] because this elijah got each church age
[1:02:54] in the right spot
[1:02:58] and and now he doesn't just throw the
[1:03:01] wood
[1:03:04] he puts the wood in order
[1:03:07] i love this
[1:03:10] i mean that suits my nature really well
[1:03:12] anyways
[1:03:14] and he put the wood in order and cut the
[1:03:16] bullock in pieces and laid him on the
[1:03:18] wood and said fill full four barrels
[1:03:21] with water and pour it on the burnt
[1:03:23] sacrificing on the wood and he said do
[1:03:25] it the second time they did it the
[1:03:26] second time and he said do it the third
[1:03:28] time they did it the third time and the
[1:03:30] water ran down about the altar and
[1:03:32] filled the trench also with water and he
[1:03:34] filled the trench also with water
[1:03:38] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:03:40] offering of the evening sacrifice
[1:03:42] see elijah didn't do this any earlier
[1:03:45] because it had to be at the time of the
[1:03:47] evening sacrifice elijah had to restore
[1:03:50] everything in the evening time
[1:03:54] and this is very significant we've
[1:03:55] preached on it before but we don't have
[1:03:57] time to go into great details but it had
[1:03:59] to be at the time of the evening
[1:04:00] sacrifice
[1:04:02] and at the time and it came to pass at
[1:04:04] the time of the offering of the evening
[1:04:05] sacrifice that elijah the prophet came
[1:04:07] near and said lord god of abraham isaac
[1:04:09] of israel let it be known this day that
[1:04:11] thou art god in israel and that i am thy
[1:04:14] servant and that i have done all these
[1:04:16] things at thy word
[1:04:19] he didn't do it by the way he felt by
[1:04:21] what he thought was best what looked
[1:04:23] nice what would be the nicest way to do
[1:04:24] this the best order for the wood the
[1:04:26] best place with these stones the number
[1:04:28] of stones i like he did everything at
[1:04:31] god's word
[1:04:33] and when he finished
[1:04:35] putting it all in order
[1:04:37] he said hear o lord hear me that this
[1:04:39] people may know that thou art the lord
[1:04:42] god that thou has turned their heart
[1:04:45] back
[1:04:46] what was the point to turn their hearts
[1:04:49] back amen because elijah and our day
[1:04:51] come to turn our hearts back to the
[1:04:53] original faith of the pentecostal
[1:04:55] fathers
[1:04:58] so what was he doing god was going to
[1:05:01] turn their hearts back but first he had
[1:05:03] to send the prophet amen who could
[1:05:05] rebuild the original altar the original
[1:05:08] worship coming back
[1:05:10] bringing back the 12 tribes amen because
[1:05:13] we had to have an alliance that would
[1:05:14] bring us back to the original worship to
[1:05:16] bring us back amen to the full measure
[1:05:18] of the seven church ages
[1:05:21] and everything was in order and
[1:05:22] everything was done according to order
[1:05:24] and he testified at the time of the
[1:05:26] evening sacrifice i've done all these
[1:05:28] things that thy word
[1:05:30] verse 38 then the fire of the lord fell
[1:05:33] and consumed the sacrifice and the wood
[1:05:35] and the stones and the dust and licked
[1:05:37] up the water that was in the trench and
[1:05:40] all the people saw it they fell on their
[1:05:42] faces and they said the lord he is the
[1:05:44] god the lord he is the god
[1:05:50] listen
[1:05:52] elijah wasn't doing things haphazardly
[1:05:55] and he wasn't doing things according to
[1:05:56] the way that he felt was best
[1:06:01] he was doing he was fulfilling the word
[1:06:03] of the lord he was letting the word
[1:06:05] guide him and the word was putting
[1:06:08] everything in order and he put
[1:06:09] everything in order according to the
[1:06:11] word and when he got everything in order
[1:06:12] according to the word and he came to the
[1:06:14] right time
[1:06:16] the time of the evening sacrifice he
[1:06:19] declares now lord i've done all this at
[1:06:21] this word now show to the people that
[1:06:23] you're turning their hearts back and the
[1:06:25] fire from heaven came down and consumed
[1:06:27] it all the stones the dust the water the
[1:06:29] sacrifice the wood everything he had was
[1:06:31] consumed by the presence of god because
[1:06:34] elijah had set it in order he had did it
[1:06:36] according to the word because when the
[1:06:38] word was given preeminence the first
[1:06:40] place the presence of god was
[1:06:44] there it was important
[1:06:47] that he did it right
[1:06:51] let's go to luke
[1:06:53] chapter 9.
[1:06:55] these things have all been preached on
[1:06:56] before we've heard them here i preached
[1:06:59] them other brothers here have preached
[1:07:00] them
[1:07:02] but i just want to put them in this
[1:07:03] context i want to line them out in this
[1:07:05] order as the lord dropped him in my
[1:07:07] heart
[1:07:10] luke chapter 9.
[1:07:18] and verse 12.
[1:07:21] luke chapter 9 and verse 12
[1:07:24] and when the day began to wear away then
[1:07:26] came to 12 and said unto him send the
[1:07:28] multitude away that they may go into
[1:07:30] town
[1:07:31] and country
[1:07:32] and the towns and country round about
[1:07:34] and lodge and get vittles for we are
[1:07:36] here in a desert place
[1:07:38] but he said unto them give ye them to
[1:07:39] eat and they said we have no more but
[1:07:41] five loaves and two fishes except we
[1:07:43] should go and buy meat for all this
[1:07:45] people and they were about 5 000 men and
[1:07:48] he said it to his disciples make them
[1:07:50] sit down by 50s in a company
[1:07:53] and they did so
[1:07:54] and made them all sit down then he took
[1:07:56] the five loaves and the two fishes and
[1:07:58] looked up to heaven he blessed them and
[1:08:00] break and gave to the disciples to set
[1:08:02] before the multitude
[1:08:04] and they did eat and were all filled and
[1:08:07] there was taken up of the fragments that
[1:08:09] remain to them 12 baskets
[1:08:12] here
[1:08:13] jesus
[1:08:15] he he finds that there's a people who's
[1:08:17] hungry and the disciples and recognize
[1:08:20] that people are hungry they have a need
[1:08:21] they need to eat amen and and they say
[1:08:25] send them away and he says no you feed
[1:08:28] them and he's looking at the disciples
[1:08:29] as you feed them and these disciples
[1:08:31] have no ability to feed this multitude
[1:08:35] they say all we have is these few fishes
[1:08:38] and these few loaves and we we don't
[1:08:41] have the ability to feed these people
[1:08:45] put on your spiritual jackets
[1:08:48] the disciples can't feed the people any
[1:08:50] more than a pastor can feed the sheep on
[1:08:52] his own
[1:08:55] any more than a minister can feed the
[1:08:56] children of god the bread of god amen
[1:08:59] unless it goes that little bit that he
[1:09:01] has goes into christ's hands and when
[1:09:02] christ breaks the bread now there's
[1:09:04] going to be a multiplication of the
[1:09:06] little gift that a brother has
[1:09:10] and so now he tells the disciples first
[1:09:13] before he does anything he says make
[1:09:16] them sit in companies of
[1:09:18] 50. there was 5 000
[1:09:22] and one account says 5 000 men besides
[1:09:25] women and children
[1:09:27] listen
[1:09:30] 5 000 men
[1:09:32] plus women and children
[1:09:34] and jesus doesn't say anything to the
[1:09:37] people
[1:09:39] he tells the disciples you make them sit
[1:09:42] in companies of 50.
[1:09:45] now listen in that group of 5 000 people
[1:09:47] you had every personality type
[1:09:49] imaginable
[1:09:52] you had submissive nature's bold natures
[1:09:54] rebellions rebellious zealots
[1:09:59] anti-government intrusion
[1:10:05] super submissive and timid you had it
[1:10:08] all
[1:10:11] we've got some deacon brothers here i'd
[1:10:13] like to ask them how many of you would
[1:10:14] want to make that group sit by 50s
[1:10:17] how many would you like that to be your
[1:10:18] responsibility
[1:10:20] it couldn't be 48 and 52
[1:10:23] 49 and 51 then there was families and
[1:10:26] there was friends
[1:10:28] but i don't want to sit over there i
[1:10:29] want to sit here please sir i need you
[1:10:31] to sit over here because we're not going
[1:10:32] to eat until we get 50 in each company
[1:10:34] how do i know you're telling me the
[1:10:35] truth i never heard him say that listen
[1:10:37] you've got to trust me
[1:10:42] we've got to sit by 50 so we all can eat
[1:10:44] i'm hungry too i want to eat two but he
[1:10:47] told me that we've got to get you to sit
[1:10:49] in 50s and if you'll just cooperate if
[1:10:51] we'll all work together we'll eat faster
[1:10:55] then as it takes longer is it ever going
[1:10:57] to happen you promised me we're going to
[1:10:58] eat i've been sitting in my group of 50
[1:11:00] now for an hour listen i'm sorry we have
[1:11:02] to get everybody in groups of 50.
[1:11:07] i'm so glad i wasn't a disciple that day
[1:11:11] john was the youngest but i bet he aged
[1:11:13] a few years
[1:11:18] then you come back and somebody's moved
[1:11:20] from this group to this group you're
[1:11:21] like no listen that won't work
[1:11:24] you got to go back where i asked you to
[1:11:26] stay and see the disciples couldn't do
[1:11:28] this by force there had to be a
[1:11:30] cooperation because you know these this
[1:11:32] small number of disciples cannot
[1:11:34] forcibly make 5 000 men plus women and
[1:11:37] children sit in groups of 50 there's got
[1:11:39] to be a cooperation between the people
[1:11:41] and the disciples they have to trust
[1:11:42] that the disciples have heard from the
[1:11:44] lord they have to trust that they're
[1:11:45] doing this for their own good and we all
[1:11:47] get in this thing together and when we
[1:11:48] all get in together we can make this
[1:11:50] process simple or we can make it
[1:11:52] difficult
[1:11:55] and finally i don't know how long it
[1:11:57] took i don't know what all was involved
[1:12:00] but they finally got them to sit in
[1:12:02] companies of 50 and then jesus takes
[1:12:05] that little bit that they had that was
[1:12:07] insufficient but because they
[1:12:10] obeyed his commandment and there was a
[1:12:12] cooperation between the ministry and
[1:12:14] between the people amen he began to
[1:12:16] break the bread and when he broke the
[1:12:18] bread jesus did not give bread to anyone
[1:12:22] he gave bread to his disciples and he
[1:12:24] told the disciples to distribute it to
[1:12:26] the people
[1:12:31] and listen
[1:12:32] these people are already just a little
[1:12:35] restless
[1:12:37] from getting in groups of 50.
[1:12:40] some have suspicion
[1:12:44] about these disciples
[1:12:48] how do you know that brother chad i'll
[1:12:49] trade jobs with you for a few years and
[1:12:51] you'll know it too
[1:12:54] because people are people our people
[1:12:57] are people
[1:13:03] coming with baskets
[1:13:06] the disciples say here you can have
[1:13:09] you can have some
[1:13:11] but there's plenty for everyone how do i
[1:13:13] know grab grab grab grab them stuff it
[1:13:15] under my arm stuff
[1:13:19] how will i know you're not going to give
[1:13:20] it to your favorite people
[1:13:23] how do i know
[1:13:26] there had to be a cooperation
[1:13:30] and they would carry around this
[1:13:32] multiplication and no doubt they were
[1:13:34] going back for more
[1:13:37] because i don't know how they carried
[1:13:39] this multiplied they had baskets because
[1:13:41] they they picked them up in baskets at
[1:13:43] the end 12 basketballs so maybe each one
[1:13:45] of them had a basket but that basket
[1:13:47] wouldn't do i mean a thousand people so
[1:13:50] they they did the basketball and no
[1:13:52] doubt they had to turn around and go
[1:13:54] back to the lord and get more but how
[1:13:55] would you like to be in the group of 50
[1:13:57] next to that group of 50 and you saw the
[1:13:59] basket just went empty
[1:14:03] and you told me if i sit in this group
[1:14:05] of 50 that i was going to eat and you
[1:14:06] don't have no more listen just hold on i
[1:14:09] don't have any more but i'm going to go
[1:14:10] back to the one who gave me this and
[1:14:11] he'll give me more for you
[1:14:16] please stay in your group of 50 please
[1:14:20] don't get up don't move please
[1:14:24] oh i feel sorry for the disciples
[1:14:28] and at the end of it
[1:14:30] they all
[1:14:31] ate
[1:14:33] and were filled
[1:14:36] at the end of this exercise they all ate
[1:14:38] until they could eat no more they were
[1:14:40] filled
[1:14:42] and there was a surplus of 12 baskets
[1:14:45] left over
[1:14:46] just in case anybody was nervous that
[1:14:48] the lord was not going to be sufficient
[1:14:50] and then if he gave a commandment to do
[1:14:52] something a certain way that it wouldn't
[1:14:54] work he left 12 baskets full so each of
[1:14:56] those disciples had a basket full left
[1:14:58] over to prove if you do it my way you'll
[1:15:01] never lack if you do it according to my
[1:15:03] word they'll always be more than what
[1:15:05] you need
[1:15:06] there'll be an abundance left over if
[1:15:08] you'll just come god's provided way and
[1:15:11] we could just cooperate together amen
[1:15:14] and trust one another if the people
[1:15:16] could trust the disciples the disciples
[1:15:18] could work with the people they couldn't
[1:15:19] force them there they had to shepherd
[1:15:21] them there
[1:15:24] can you imagine a few disciples 5 000
[1:15:27] people it wouldn't take long even the
[1:15:28] women and children could tear them to
[1:15:30] pieces
[1:15:32] it had to be a cooperation
[1:15:36] they had to be gentle they had to be
[1:15:37] honest they had to talk to the people
[1:15:39] they had to convince them that what they
[1:15:41] were telling them was the truth the
[1:15:42] people had to believe them they had to
[1:15:44] sit down in groups of 50. then they had
[1:15:45] to wait till the lord broke the bread
[1:15:47] then they had to wait while it was
[1:15:48] distributed how long would it take to
[1:15:50] feed that many people i have no idea but
[1:15:53] it probably took a while
[1:15:56] and the people had to stay in position
[1:15:58] stay in their group and wait for the
[1:16:00] disciple to bring them the bread they
[1:16:01] couldn't go to jesus themselves and get
[1:16:03] it he told the disciples to bring it to
[1:16:05] him
[1:16:06] they had to trust the lord they had to
[1:16:08] trust this whole process but when they
[1:16:10] trust the process and they stayed in
[1:16:12] order and everything went according to
[1:16:14] god's word he proved how effective it is
[1:16:17] to just obey him by leaving 12 baskets
[1:16:20] left over
[1:16:24] praise be to god
[1:16:27] jesus could have just fed him
[1:16:30] jesus could have had food show up in
[1:16:32] their laps
[1:16:34] he could have had manna fall like dew
[1:16:36] and lay all around them on the ground
[1:16:38] but this is the way he wanted to do it
[1:16:45] it doesn't have to make sense
[1:16:48] it doesn't have to be
[1:16:50] it doesn't even have to be reasonable
[1:16:55] we just have to obey the lord
[1:17:00] let's go to first corinthians chapter
[1:17:02] 14.
[1:17:16] first corinthians 14
[1:17:19] 26
[1:17:23] how is it then brethren when you come
[1:17:25] together every one of you have a psalm
[1:17:27] have a doctrine have a tongue have a
[1:17:29] revelation have an interpretation let
[1:17:31] all things be done unto edifying if any
[1:17:34] man speak in an unknown tongue let it be
[1:17:36] by two or at the most three and that by
[1:17:38] course and let one interpret but if
[1:17:40] there be no interpreter let him keep
[1:17:42] silence in the church and let him speak
[1:17:44] to himself into god
[1:17:46] let the prophet speak two or three and
[1:17:48] let the other judge
[1:17:50] if anything be revealed to another that
[1:17:51] sitteth by let the first hold us peace
[1:17:54] from you may all prophesy one by one
[1:17:56] that all may learn and all may be
[1:17:58] comforted and the spirits of the
[1:17:59] prophets are subject to the prophets for
[1:18:01] god is not the author of confusion but
[1:18:04] of peace as in all the churches of the
[1:18:06] saints let your women keep silence in
[1:18:08] the churches for it is not permitted
[1:18:10] unto them to speak but they are
[1:18:11] commanded to be under obedience is also
[1:18:14] saith the law
[1:18:15] if they will learn anything let them ask
[1:18:17] their husbands at home for it is a shame
[1:18:19] for a woman to speak in the church
[1:18:21] what came the word of god out from you
[1:18:23] or came it unto you only if any man
[1:18:26] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:18:27] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:18:29] things that i write unto you are the
[1:18:30] commandments of the lord but if any man
[1:18:33] be ignorant let him be ignorant
[1:18:34] wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and
[1:18:37] forbid not to speak with tongues that
[1:18:39] all things be done decently and in order
[1:18:46] just as god
[1:18:48] ordered eden the garden of eden he put
[1:18:51] adam there to keep it
[1:18:53] now he comes in the wilderness and he
[1:18:56] wants to order
[1:18:57] the nation of israel and he wants them
[1:19:00] to keep their order and he tells moses
[1:19:02] and moses tells the people and moses now
[1:19:04] is ordering the church in the wilderness
[1:19:06] but then here comes a long paul and paul
[1:19:09] now is ordering the new testament church
[1:19:12] so i hope you're seeing a pattern all
[1:19:14] the way down through the scripture that
[1:19:16] god wants things done
[1:19:18] decently and in
[1:19:20] order that's god's way
[1:19:25] and i'd like to just
[1:19:27] inject this thought if i can
[1:19:31] brother better says in god identifying
[1:19:33] himself by his characteristics he said
[1:19:34] all right while the people line up i
[1:19:36] haven't got time to see who they are or
[1:19:38] what they are he's coming to a prayer
[1:19:40] line now but now all out there that
[1:19:42] knows that i don't know you raise up
[1:19:44] your hand say i have need of god but you
[1:19:46] don't know me brother brennan but i have
[1:19:48] need of god i'm just going to raise my
[1:19:50] hand now if you'll just settle for a few
[1:19:53] minutes watch be careful be quiet
[1:19:55] now i don't mean when i say be quiet if
[1:19:57] the lord does anything you want to
[1:19:58] praise the lord that's worship but what
[1:20:00] i mean just don't run around get up you
[1:20:02] know that's irreverent
[1:20:04] and the holy spirit is very timid very
[1:20:06] timid see just anything like that just
[1:20:09] leaves me and i just have to battle then
[1:20:11] again see but if if you'll listen
[1:20:15] brother bam is coming to a prayer line
[1:20:16] and there's people with great needs
[1:20:19] and he's asking for the cooperation of
[1:20:21] the people
[1:20:22] and he's trying to take their
[1:20:24] understanding to a higher order
[1:20:26] he's trying to get him not to get up and
[1:20:28] stir around and not to move about and
[1:20:30] not be talking and not be restless at
[1:20:31] this time because now he's coming to a
[1:20:34] prayer line and he says the holy spirit
[1:20:36] is very timid
[1:20:38] he says it twice very timid
[1:20:40] and he'll just leave me and then i've
[1:20:42] got to fight to get back
[1:20:44] and so here the prophet of god is asking
[1:20:46] for the cooperation of the people to
[1:20:48] keep the atmosphere right because the
[1:20:50] holy ghost is timid
[1:20:53] i hope we learn something from that
[1:20:56] the holy ghost is timid and he doesn't
[1:20:58] do well with chaos
[1:21:02] it's not his nature
[1:21:04] he has a different nature
[1:21:07] and the holy ghost doesn't deal with
[1:21:08] chaos
[1:21:10] he leaves that's what brother branham
[1:21:11] says he leaves
[1:21:17] he said in the message
[1:21:19] be not afraid of his eye now i'm just
[1:21:21] going to wait a moment i'm waiting for
[1:21:23] the audience to get quiet reverend the
[1:21:26] holy spirit is so timid oh just one
[1:21:28] little thing he will go away he will
[1:21:30] just leave me then i have to walk away
[1:21:33] brother's telling the people if if that
[1:21:36] holy ghost is not here
[1:21:38] i have to walk away and we leave the
[1:21:40] people sick and leave the people in need
[1:21:41] or he said before fight to get it back
[1:21:44] and he's teaching us a lesson about the
[1:21:46] nature of the holy ghost it's natured
[1:21:48] with a dove amen it's timid it can't
[1:21:50] take amen it can't take a rough
[1:21:53] atmosphere it can't take routine as it
[1:21:54] can't take the wrong spirit the wrong
[1:21:56] approach the wrong attitude
[1:22:00] he says in the token he says jesus was
[1:22:02] baptized by john and the bible said and
[1:22:04] when he saw the spirit of god like a
[1:22:06] dove coming down upon him
[1:22:08] therefore
[1:22:09] if i would have been if it would have
[1:22:10] been a wolf or if it would have been any
[1:22:12] other animal the nature of the dove
[1:22:14] could not have blended with the nature
[1:22:15] of the wolf neither could the nature of
[1:22:17] the dove blended with any other animal
[1:22:20] but the lamb
[1:22:21] and these two natures come together then
[1:22:24] they could agree with each other
[1:22:27] the brother of them takes us
[1:22:29] all the way back to jordan and shows
[1:22:31] that if there had been any nature there
[1:22:33] in jesus christ amen that that dove
[1:22:36] would not have rested upon him because
[1:22:38] paul was told whoever you see the holy
[1:22:41] ghost descend and remain upon
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:45] and if he would brother ben said if he
[1:22:47] would have snarled like a wolf
[1:22:49] and he snapped he would have taken his
[1:22:51] flight
[1:22:53] and so he had to have a complementary
[1:22:56] nature
[1:22:58] to work with and a complementary nature
[1:23:00] to the dove is the lamb
[1:23:03] is that right
[1:23:04] and so now the dove amen we we recognize
[1:23:08] all the way back in the ark amen when
[1:23:10] the dove and the crow were released the
[1:23:13] dove would go and could find no place to
[1:23:15] set its feet
[1:23:17] is that what it says
[1:23:19] because the dove is a clean animal and
[1:23:21] cannot set its feet on death and
[1:23:23] destruction and
[1:23:26] but the raven could set its feet on
[1:23:29] wheat
[1:23:30] and eat and the raven could set its feet
[1:23:32] on a bloated dead body and eat
[1:23:35] but the dove wasn't that kind of nature
[1:23:37] it could only rest its feet on something
[1:23:39] that was clean
[1:23:42] amen so out of the window it goes and no
[1:23:45] place to rest its feet it comes back and
[1:23:47] it goes again another time and it comes
[1:23:50] back amen with a with a leaf and it's a
[1:23:53] an olive leaf i think it is amen in its
[1:23:56] hand showing an olive leaf is also a
[1:23:58] type of the holy ghost showing that
[1:24:00] there's now life coming forth now i can
[1:24:03] rest upon life not upon death now
[1:24:06] there's something that i can rest my
[1:24:07] feet upon
[1:24:09] and now when when john is told the one
[1:24:12] you see the the holy ghost come upon and
[1:24:14] remain and he saw it like a dove in the
[1:24:17] form of a dove come down and remain upon
[1:24:19] jesus christ showing that there's no
[1:24:22] death here amen there's no chaos here
[1:24:24] there's if there had been chaos here it
[1:24:26] would have showed that that the serpent
[1:24:28] had been working somewhere
[1:24:32] there was no chaos he was in order he
[1:24:35] come in order to the word he came down
[1:24:37] to be baptized in obedience to the word
[1:24:41] and there was a complementary natures
[1:24:44] amen so the holy ghost could now come
[1:24:46] down and it could rest upon and remain
[1:24:48] upon this nature because it was the
[1:24:50] nature of the land but brother bam told
[1:24:51] us it wouldn't have matched with any
[1:24:53] other nature
[1:24:55] and we know the nature of the lamb
[1:24:57] brother ben tells us is submissive
[1:25:00] is that right
[1:25:02] it's
[1:25:03] timid
[1:25:05] it's soft
[1:25:08] it's it's vulnerable
[1:25:11] it needs a shepherd for leadership
[1:25:14] this is the nature this is the nature of
[1:25:16] a shepherd this is the nature of a of a
[1:25:19] sheep of a lamb amen and the dove and
[1:25:21] the lamb could come together but the
[1:25:23] dove and the wolf couldn't come together
[1:25:24] because the wolf snarls and snaps and
[1:25:26] takes what it's want and uses force and
[1:25:28] all of these but his sheep never does
[1:25:31] a lamb never does so he said these two
[1:25:33] things could come together and when we
[1:25:35] look at it in church order when we come
[1:25:37] together we want to have that kind of
[1:25:40] spirit among us the spirit of the lamb
[1:25:42] amen we're not here to have our own way
[1:25:45] we're not here to do it the way i like
[1:25:46] we're not here amen i can do what i want
[1:25:48] and if i and if i and if i want to stand
[1:25:51] out in the foyer and if i want to talk
[1:25:52] and not not listen to what the prophet
[1:25:54] said to come in early i can do what i
[1:25:56] want this is america that's not the
[1:25:58] nature of the lamb
[1:26:00] because the prophet encouraged us to get
[1:26:02] in here early to meditate to create an
[1:26:04] atmosphere to get yourself in the right
[1:26:06] atmosphere so you can wash away
[1:26:08] all the worldly wolf stuff
[1:26:12] because we want the timid holy ghost to
[1:26:13] come down and he only comes down in the
[1:26:16] right atmosphere with the right nature
[1:26:18] amen he doesn't come down amen upon
[1:26:20] chaos upon wolf natures and upon things
[1:26:23] like that so when the prophet of god
[1:26:25] amen begins to line us out in church
[1:26:27] order and begins to tell us come in
[1:26:29] early get quiet if you would like come
[1:26:32] to the altar and pray quietly go to your
[1:26:34] seat what your neighbor does that's up
[1:26:36] to them has nothing to do with you amen
[1:26:38] and he's saying just come right in come
[1:26:40] into the sanctuary he even encourages
[1:26:42] the people he's seen and another church
[1:26:44] where they come in 30 minutes early he
[1:26:46] liked it he told his church it would be
[1:26:47] good if we do that
[1:26:51] why that's not a law
[1:26:53] that's not something that has to be
[1:26:55] enforced
[1:26:57] but the lamb doesn't need enforcements
[1:27:04] he's submissive
[1:27:05] if the prophet said that would be good
[1:27:08] that would be good if you would do that
[1:27:15] and he explains why
[1:27:18] it's about creating an atmosphere
[1:27:20] brother branham's in church order he's
[1:27:22] trying to get the people amen to come to
[1:27:25] church prepared to come focus to come
[1:27:28] with one goal in one mind we're coming
[1:27:31] to church for one thing that's for the
[1:27:33] word to have preeminence in my life i'm
[1:27:35] coming together amen for the one who's
[1:27:37] sitting on the throne everything we're
[1:27:39] doing is pointing and reflecting to the
[1:27:41] one sitting on the throne
[1:27:43] so the word has preeminence among us so
[1:27:45] that the dove is welcome among us and so
[1:27:47] paul is telling everybody don't be in
[1:27:49] chaos don't be jumping up and saying
[1:27:50] this and doing that and everybody's got
[1:27:52] something they want to do he said let
[1:27:54] everything be done decently and in order
[1:27:58] so when brother is bringing his church
[1:28:00] order he's bringing us into the right
[1:28:02] nature
[1:28:04] he's bringing us into the right approach
[1:28:06] to god amen now it's not about i have to
[1:28:09] do this and i have to do that there's no
[1:28:12] half dues friends nobody's punishing
[1:28:14] anybody or banning anybody from the
[1:28:16] church because they don't keep brother
[1:28:17] ben's church that's not it it's all
[1:28:20] about the purpose what's the purpose
[1:28:22] what's the purpose what's the purpose
[1:28:27] it's because we want to come in orderly
[1:28:30] quiet ourselves
[1:28:32] have the right nature
[1:28:34] have the right atmosphere
[1:28:36] because the holy ghost is timid
[1:28:40] very timid and when brother brown says
[1:28:42] that he says quiet he is not talking
[1:28:44] about saying amen preach it brother
[1:28:47] he's not talking about clapping our
[1:28:48] hands and rejoicing he's not talking
[1:28:50] about singing and shouting he said
[1:28:52] that's worship that's in order that's
[1:28:54] correct he's not talking about any of
[1:28:55] that he's talking about anything else
[1:28:57] besides that
[1:29:01] to try
[1:29:02] to try to get us in the right atmosphere
[1:29:06] the right order like solomon brought in
[1:29:08] that day
[1:29:10] to get to get us in the right place in
[1:29:13] the right order and the right atmosphere
[1:29:17] because we want to welcome the presence
[1:29:19] of the lord
[1:29:23] let's go to first timothy chapter 3.
[1:29:31] first timothy chapter 3 verse 14.
[1:29:44] so these things i write unto you hoping
[1:29:46] to come unto you shortly
[1:29:48] but if i tear it along that thou mayest
[1:29:50] know how thou ought us to behave thyself
[1:29:52] in the house of god
[1:29:53] which is the church of the living god
[1:29:55] the pillar and ground of truth
[1:29:59] paul had to order the new testament
[1:30:01] church just like moses had to order the
[1:30:03] church in the wilderness
[1:30:05] and he wanted to know how they ought us
[1:30:06] to behave themselves
[1:30:09] in the house of god
[1:30:11] and it was all about the word having
[1:30:14] preeminence
[1:30:16] i want to read acts chapter 6 together
[1:30:19] if we could turn there
[1:30:20] and we're winding down just a few more
[1:30:22] scriptures i'd like to read
[1:30:24] a few more quotes
[1:30:28] acts chapter 6.
[1:30:42] acts chapter 6 verse 1 and in those days
[1:30:44] when the number of the disciples was
[1:30:46] multiplied
[1:30:47] there arose a murmuring of the grecians
[1:30:49] against the hebrews because their widows
[1:30:51] were neglected in the daily
[1:30:52] administration
[1:30:54] then the twelve called the multitude of
[1:30:55] the disciples unto them and said it is
[1:30:57] not reason that we should leave the word
[1:31:00] of god and serve tables wherefore
[1:31:02] brethren look ye out among you seven men
[1:31:05] honest of honest report full of the holy
[1:31:07] ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint
[1:31:10] over this business
[1:31:12] but we will give ourselves continually
[1:31:14] to prayer to the ministry of the word
[1:31:18] and the saying pleased the whole
[1:31:19] multitude and they chose stephen a man
[1:31:21] full of faith and the holy ghost and
[1:31:23] philip and procurus and nicanor and and
[1:31:27] timmin and
[1:31:29] i hate reading names parminis and
[1:31:31] nicholas the proselyte of antioch whom
[1:31:34] they set before the apostles and when
[1:31:36] they had prayed they laid their hands on
[1:31:38] them and the word of god increased and
[1:31:40] the number of the disciples multiplied
[1:31:42] in jerusalem greatly and a great company
[1:31:44] the priests were obedient to the faith
[1:31:48] this is the establishment of the office
[1:31:50] of deacons
[1:31:52] but i want us to recognize the purpose
[1:31:55] between the establishment of the office
[1:31:57] of deacons
[1:31:59] what was the purpose the purpose was so
[1:32:01] that the disciples the apostles can give
[1:32:03] themselves continually to the prayer and
[1:32:05] to the word
[1:32:06] it was to put the word in preeminence
[1:32:08] even the office of deacon is to keep the
[1:32:10] word in preeminence
[1:32:13] that's why brother baby says the deacon
[1:32:14] or the assistant to the pastor to help
[1:32:16] take care of things so that the ministry
[1:32:19] can focus on the word
[1:32:22] because it's all about having the word
[1:32:24] having preeminence so even the offices
[1:32:27] in the church is still about the same
[1:32:29] thing and if we keep the same focus we
[1:32:31] understand why do we have deacons why do
[1:32:33] we have trustees why do we have offices
[1:32:35] in the church it's all for the same
[1:32:37] purpose to keep the word in preeminence
[1:32:40] the very foundation of deacons was so
[1:32:43] that the ministry the apostles didn't
[1:32:45] get pulled away from prayer from fasting
[1:32:48] from the word to go tend to the needs of
[1:32:50] the people so they set up a group that
[1:32:52] would tend to the needs of the people so
[1:32:53] that they could stay focused amen on the
[1:32:56] word
[1:32:58] and when they stayed focused on the word
[1:33:00] it said in verse 7 and the word of god
[1:33:02] increased increased increase when they
[1:33:05] get it in order according to the what
[1:33:07] the apostles had established in this day
[1:33:10] the word increased
[1:33:12] not the number of people that increased
[1:33:14] to but the word increased
[1:33:16] and we want to give preeminence to the
[1:33:18] word so the word can increase so why do
[1:33:21] we have deacons so that the minister is
[1:33:23] free the pastor is more free to focus on
[1:33:26] the word the ministers can focus on the
[1:33:28] word so that the word will increase
[1:33:33] that's why we have deacons
[1:33:37] the deacons are instructed to keep
[1:33:40] keep the order of the sanctuary
[1:33:43] but you know
[1:33:45] it would be just as hopeless as that day
[1:33:46] those disciples had to had to set them
[1:33:49] down in 50s if there's not a cooperation
[1:33:51] if there's not a people who already
[1:33:53] understand why we want order in the
[1:33:55] sanctuary
[1:33:57] when you understand if i come according
[1:34:00] to the order if i come quietly if i come
[1:34:03] to the altar and pray go to my seat or
[1:34:05] sit in my seat and pray and open my
[1:34:07] bible and read quietly and prepare
[1:34:09] myself if i come decently if i come in
[1:34:11] order what am i doing i am preparing the
[1:34:14] way to get the word and preeminence amen
[1:34:17] and there's a cooperation there's not
[1:34:19] the deacons can't keep the order of the
[1:34:21] sanctuary if everybody in the sanctuary
[1:34:23] doesn't want to keep order
[1:34:26] so then the deacons are there for the
[1:34:27] newcomers the inexperienced the new to
[1:34:30] the faith
[1:34:33] right
[1:34:34] it's not their job to keep everybody in
[1:34:35] order it's everybody's job to stay in
[1:34:37] order
[1:34:40] that that responsibility belongs to all
[1:34:42] of us to stay in order because if we all
[1:34:45] stay in order there's a cooperation when
[1:34:48] there's a cooperation in every joint
[1:34:50] supply what do we want friends we want
[1:34:52] the word to increase
[1:34:56] we want the word to increase greatly if
[1:34:58] we want the word to increase then
[1:34:59] everybody has to cooperate
[1:35:04] i'm not preaching this because we don't
[1:35:05] have cooperation you all do great that's
[1:35:06] not the point i'm preaching it because i
[1:35:08] preached it to the ministers and i liked
[1:35:10] it
[1:35:11] so i'm just preaching what i preached to
[1:35:12] them we don't have any issues here but
[1:35:14] i'm just one i just wanted to show the
[1:35:16] purpose behind the purpose
[1:35:20] it's not it's not that the
[1:35:23] the deacons are out to get the teenagers
[1:35:25] and the teenagers right we don't have
[1:35:27] that issue
[1:35:29] that's not here
[1:35:30] but when we all understand what's trying
[1:35:32] to be accomplished and we all said we
[1:35:34] get on the same team we get on the same
[1:35:35] page we move in the same atmosphere we
[1:35:38] create the same atmosphere in the
[1:35:39] sanctuary brother bannon said that's why
[1:35:41] we don't have a bunch of singing and
[1:35:42] carrying on amen because you get the
[1:35:44] people all work wore out before the word
[1:35:47] comes
[1:35:49] brother branham in church already says
[1:35:50] that's why we don't have a bunch of
[1:35:51] singing and a bunch of carrying on a
[1:35:53] bunch of testimonies he said maybe if
[1:35:55] you're in a special meeting and have an
[1:35:56] outstanding testimony somebody got saved
[1:35:58] or something share that but not just a
[1:35:59] bunch of testimonies and testimony
[1:36:01] meetings he said i see those things get
[1:36:03] out of hand and the people get so wore
[1:36:05] out their wore out before the word comes
[1:36:08] so what's brother branham doing in the
[1:36:09] church or is he saying don't testify
[1:36:11] don't sing he's saying keep the main
[1:36:14] thing in focus and that's the preaching
[1:36:16] of the word
[1:36:18] all the church order is about the word
[1:36:20] having preeminence
[1:36:25] that's why when brother branham preached
[1:36:27] church order he said this is this is to
[1:36:30] branham tabernacle at such and such a
[1:36:33] number 8th street and 10th street
[1:36:37] so he's saying this church order is to
[1:36:39] this church
[1:36:41] because brother branham teaches the
[1:36:43] sovereignty of the local church because
[1:36:45] you can't take brother branham's church
[1:36:46] order and make it fit every church
[1:36:50] you have to be the same kind of people
[1:36:53] in the same kind of location with the
[1:36:54] same physical structure
[1:36:56] i told you this is brothers in india i
[1:36:58] went to church one time to a church an
[1:37:01] official church
[1:37:02] a gathering of people an official church
[1:37:04] in malawi and they gathered every sunday
[1:37:07] under a mango tree
[1:37:11] i said how do you put a deacon at each
[1:37:13] door
[1:37:15] when you have church under a mango tree
[1:37:20] how do you keep the kids from running
[1:37:21] through the sanctuary between services
[1:37:25] don't run by the mango tree
[1:37:28] see what brother branham was showing
[1:37:30] when we got to watch him set his church
[1:37:32] and ordered eighth and penn street he
[1:37:34] gave us an example he gave us a pattern
[1:37:36] he gave us something and we caught the
[1:37:38] purpose behind it now whether you have
[1:37:40] church in your home or you have church
[1:37:42] under a mango tree or you have church in
[1:37:43] a designated sanctuary you can take what
[1:37:46] the prophet brought and bring it in to
[1:37:48] accomplish the same purpose because your
[1:37:50] vision is higher than the rule
[1:37:55] because i've seen a whole lot of rule
[1:37:57] keeping that's nothing more than
[1:37:58] legalism and everybody feels good about
[1:38:00] the rule we kept all the rule but the
[1:38:02] dove wasn't welcome in that service
[1:38:05] and his feet didn't come down and rest
[1:38:07] so what was the point of keeping all the
[1:38:09] rules if the dove didn't come and the
[1:38:11] word didn't have preeminence
[1:38:14] we kept all the rules but we preached
[1:38:15] the false doctrine we didn't give the
[1:38:17] word preeminence
[1:38:20] so it's not about the rule it's about
[1:38:21] the concept it's about the principle
[1:38:23] about giving honor unto a prophet who is
[1:38:25] here to order the church to put the
[1:38:27] church back in order just like elijah
[1:38:29] put the put the worship back in order
[1:38:34] hey amen
[1:38:36] but the venom preaches over and over and
[1:38:38] over every church is sovereign
[1:38:40] and you cannot change that doctrine in
[1:38:42] the message
[1:38:46] brother branham preaches
[1:38:48] in church order he says well brethren
[1:38:51] i've appreciated being here with you
[1:38:52] tonight and brother neville to the
[1:38:54] deacons and trustees and sunday school
[1:38:56] superintendent all of you we trust that
[1:38:58] the lord will help you now carry out
[1:39:00] these orders for the kingdom of god the
[1:39:02] reason i have said this is because that
[1:39:04] i think you have grown from children to
[1:39:06] adults
[1:39:08] the reason he's preaching church order
[1:39:10] because he thinks he's grown from
[1:39:11] children to adults
[1:39:14] so the teaching of church order is
[1:39:17] you have to be mature
[1:39:20] when you was a child you talk like a
[1:39:22] child you understood as a child but now
[1:39:24] you're a man so let's act as adults in
[1:39:26] the house of god behave ourselves
[1:39:28] honoring our offices and honoring every
[1:39:30] office every gift that the lord has
[1:39:32] given us let's put it in order and honor
[1:39:35] god with our gifts and our offices
[1:39:38] praise be to god
[1:39:41] i think it's interesting to note that
[1:39:43] when brother venom comes to preach the
[1:39:45] seals
[1:39:46] he's coming to this week in march to
[1:39:48] preach the seals he's met the angels
[1:39:49] he's got his commission he knows what
[1:39:51] he's coming to those services to do but
[1:39:53] the first service he comes to is he
[1:39:55] preaches
[1:39:56] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:39:58] revealing himself in the same and the
[1:40:00] very first thing he does is dedicate the
[1:40:02] church and remind the people of church
[1:40:04] order
[1:40:08] and he says it's not a dedication we did
[1:40:10] that 30 or 31 years ago it's a
[1:40:12] re-dedication
[1:40:15] because the church was dedicated on the
[1:40:16] day of pentecost but now we're coming to
[1:40:18] the seals to a rededication of the
[1:40:20] church
[1:40:22] and when he comes to the rededication of
[1:40:24] the church he goes into church order and
[1:40:26] starts teaching his old church order and
[1:40:28] giving people church order right here in
[1:40:30] god hiding himself in simplicity amen so
[1:40:33] what precedes the opening of the seals
[1:40:35] the preceding of the opening of the
[1:40:37] seals is dedication and church order
[1:40:41] and when you get dedication in church
[1:40:43] order right then comes forth the seals
[1:40:47] because it's all about putting the word
[1:40:50] in preeminence
[1:40:52] it's all about the one sitting on the
[1:40:54] throne church order is all about the one
[1:40:56] sitting on the throne
[1:40:59] and if we miss that amen we've missed
[1:41:02] church order
[1:41:05] brother benham he's hearing god hiding
[1:41:07] himself in simplicity he says now in the
[1:41:09] old tabernacle there might not be one
[1:41:10] person present this morning that was
[1:41:12] here the day of dedication when major
[1:41:14] ulrich played the music and stood behind
[1:41:16] three crosses here to dedicate the place
[1:41:19] i would not permit anybody to us or
[1:41:21] stood at the door to see that nobody
[1:41:22] talked when you're done you're talking
[1:41:24] outside you come in if you desire too
[1:41:26] silently you come to the altar and pray
[1:41:27] silently you walk back to your seat open
[1:41:29] up the bible what your neighbor done
[1:41:31] that was up to him
[1:41:32] you had nothing to say
[1:41:34] if you wanted to talk to him say i'll
[1:41:35] see him outside i'm in here to worship
[1:41:38] the lord you read his word or sat
[1:41:39] quietly and then the music sister gertie
[1:41:42] i don't know whether she's here this
[1:41:43] morning or not sister gibbs the old
[1:41:45] piano i believe set back in this corner
[1:41:47] and the best of my remembrance and she
[1:41:49] would play softly down at the cross
[1:41:51] where my savior died some real sweet
[1:41:54] soft music
[1:41:55] and then until it come time for the
[1:41:57] service and the song leader got up and
[1:41:59] led a couple of congregational songs and
[1:42:01] then if they had some outstanding solo
[1:42:03] they sang it but never just a bunch of
[1:42:04] carrying on
[1:42:06] and when the music continually played
[1:42:08] and went and then when i heard that i
[1:42:10] knowed it was time to come out and when
[1:42:13] a minister walks into a congregation of
[1:42:15] people praying in the anointing of the
[1:42:16] spirit you're bound to hear from heaven
[1:42:22] that's just all there's no way to keep
[1:42:23] from it but if you walk into confusion
[1:42:25] then you're so confused the spirit's
[1:42:27] grieved
[1:42:32] brother branham it looked like he was so
[1:42:34] strict
[1:42:36] i wouldn't allow any talking i should
[1:42:38] stood at the doors to see to it nobody
[1:42:40] talked come in pray the order you want
[1:42:42] go to your seat read your bible pray
[1:42:45] when your neighbor did don't talk i
[1:42:46] wouldn't allow this i wouldn't allow
[1:42:48] that and gertie sister gertie or sister
[1:42:50] gibbs would play quietly and then the
[1:42:51] song leader would sing a few songs maybe
[1:42:53] a solo but not a bunch of carrying on
[1:42:55] and then and then when it began to play
[1:42:57] i knew it was time to come and i would
[1:42:59] come brother brennaman looks like he's
[1:43:00] so strict but what's he driving to
[1:43:02] what's the whole point of it all why are
[1:43:04] the rules in the first place why the
[1:43:06] order to begin with because when a
[1:43:08] minister walks into a group of people
[1:43:10] and that atmosphere anointed by the
[1:43:11] spirit you're bound to hear from god
[1:43:14] it was all about the increasing of the
[1:43:16] word so that the word would increase
[1:43:18] it's not about rule keeping amen this
[1:43:20] isn't a denomination it's not an order
[1:43:22] it's not a structure amen we're not here
[1:43:24] to get a merit badge for church order
[1:43:28] we've got a church order right
[1:43:30] no we're here to get focused on this one
[1:43:32] thing the one thing that matters most
[1:43:34] the one thing that will change our lives
[1:43:36] to keep us going that'll keep us fed
[1:43:38] that'll keep us strength in the spirit
[1:43:40] the very thing that we need more than
[1:43:41] anything else is the word amen
[1:43:44] we need the word and we need god to
[1:43:46] preach it in the spirit to give us
[1:43:48] revelation of the word and that's the
[1:43:50] one that has preeminence among us it's
[1:43:52] all about the one sitting on the throne
[1:43:54] [Music]
[1:43:59] brother bannon says in 1957
[1:44:02] and may the lord add his blessing to the
[1:44:03] reading of his word and for a text
[1:44:05] tonight if i should be called that
[1:44:07] and no matter any kind of service the
[1:44:09] word should have preeminence it should
[1:44:12] be first
[1:44:14] brother brennan is not saying
[1:44:16] that you have to do the preaching first
[1:44:19] he's saying the word should have first
[1:44:20] place
[1:44:24] and god hiding himself in simplicity
[1:44:26] again he says father we now dedicate
[1:44:28] ourselves to the service to the word
[1:44:32] brother branham was never setting up
[1:44:34] church to have church
[1:44:39] now we now dedicate ourselves to the
[1:44:41] service to the word with all that's in
[1:44:43] us lord the congregation and the people
[1:44:45] they dedicate themselves this morning to
[1:44:47] the hearing of the word and as we
[1:44:49] ministers dedicate ourselves to the
[1:44:51] preaching of the word
[1:44:52] so what was the dedication the
[1:44:54] congregation is dedicated to hearing the
[1:44:57] word and the people are dedicated the
[1:44:59] ministry is dedicated to preaching the
[1:45:01] word so what's everybody dedicated for
[1:45:03] what's the building dedicated for what
[1:45:05] are the people dedicated for what's the
[1:45:07] ministry dedicated for it's all
[1:45:09] dedicated for the word
[1:45:11] this place is dedicated for the word
[1:45:13] amen the mystery is dedicated supposed
[1:45:14] to be dedicated for the word and the
[1:45:16] people are supposed to be dedicated to
[1:45:17] hear the word
[1:45:20] it's all about the word
[1:45:22] having preeminence
[1:45:24] that's the whole point
[1:45:30] branham comes to the seventh seal
[1:45:35] and in the seventh seal
[1:45:40] he says now notice in revelation 7 we
[1:45:43] read this 12 000 of each tribe of the
[1:45:45] selected out of all there's 12 000 out
[1:45:48] of each tribe that's elected and are set
[1:45:51] right here in order oh my what are they
[1:45:54] they're in tribal order
[1:45:55] yet they're not now but they will be so
[1:45:58] brother of them is in the seventh seal
[1:45:59] and he's preaching back on the seventh
[1:46:01] chapter of revelation and he's showing
[1:46:03] that there's 144 000 elect jews that are
[1:46:06] going to be called in the end time
[1:46:08] during the tribulation period and when
[1:46:10] they're called he said they're not in
[1:46:12] order they don't know their tribal order
[1:46:13] they don't know what tribe they're from
[1:46:15] he said but they're going to be put back
[1:46:17] in order
[1:46:19] you think god doesn't care about order
[1:46:21] it's everywhere it's in the entire bible
[1:46:25] this is why our homes have to be in
[1:46:26] order when we get out of order and mom
[1:46:28] takes dominion and dad becomes
[1:46:30] submissive amen that thing can't be
[1:46:32] blessed by god
[1:46:34] because it's out of god's order it
[1:46:36] doesn't reflect god
[1:46:39] so when we get our families out of order
[1:46:41] the children in rebellion and no respect
[1:46:43] for mom and dad and chaos in our homes
[1:46:45] that thing is not right that's not the
[1:46:47] order god's looking for we're not just
[1:46:49] talking about church order we're talking
[1:46:51] about order
[1:46:53] and the word brings order the word puts
[1:46:55] that in its place the word puts mom in
[1:46:57] her place the word puts the kids in
[1:46:58] their place so that everybody's in their
[1:47:00] position and the family is moving in
[1:47:02] harmony and unity there's a cooperation
[1:47:05] of effort and it's all for the same
[1:47:07] thing to glorify and magnify god to
[1:47:09] minister the word and to have a home
[1:47:11] where the holy ghost is welcome to rest
[1:47:13] his feet
[1:47:15] because we have to have a home where
[1:47:16] it's not the nature of the wolf where
[1:47:18] i'm biting you and you're biting me and
[1:47:20] we expect the holy ghost to come and
[1:47:21] rest in that home
[1:47:24] but it's got to be a home where the
[1:47:25] nature of the lamb is the nature that
[1:47:27] the home keeps getting brought under
[1:47:29] and when the wolf nature pops up we take
[1:47:31] care of it amen so we bring the nature
[1:47:33] of the home back into the lamb nature
[1:47:35] submissive to the word and cooperation
[1:47:37] with one another all working in harmony
[1:47:40] for one purpose where the holy ghost is
[1:47:42] welcome to rest his feet
[1:47:46] so you see why i'm not preaching about
[1:47:48] church order
[1:47:50] it's order
[1:47:51] the word brings order
[1:47:53] the devil brings a perversion of the
[1:47:55] word to bring disorder
[1:47:59] the the devil's trying to break order
[1:48:02] god's word is bringing order
[1:48:07] praise be to god
[1:48:10] and so now the 144 thousand why couldn't
[1:48:14] he just call 144 000 and say you're it
[1:48:18] they had to be put back in order because
[1:48:20] god cares about order
[1:48:24] yet they are not now but they will be
[1:48:25] they're in tribal order what will be in
[1:48:27] the tribal order not the regular jew
[1:48:30] what's going to be in tribal order not
[1:48:32] all the jews
[1:48:34] the elect are going to be put back in
[1:48:36] order
[1:48:38] not the regular jew but the ones that's
[1:48:40] the elected the 144 000 will be set in
[1:48:42] tribal order
[1:48:44] oh my how i would like to show you we
[1:48:47] won't get into it but that's exactly
[1:48:49] what the church has to be right in order
[1:48:53] he didn't elaborate on it he didn't
[1:48:55] preach anymore on it he said oh how i
[1:48:57] wish i had time we won't go into it but
[1:48:59] what happens to the 144 000 elect is
[1:49:02] exactly what has to happen to the elect
[1:49:04] bride in the end time she has to be put
[1:49:06] back in order amen the the the altar has
[1:49:09] to be put back in place the seven stones
[1:49:12] have to be put back in order
[1:49:15] this church has to come back into god's
[1:49:17] order amen so that the presence of god
[1:49:20] can fill the temple
[1:49:27] and the message the paradox
[1:49:33] brother bam says i've often wanted to
[1:49:34] come into a church
[1:49:37] i've longed to see it
[1:49:42] this is amazing when brother brown says
[1:49:43] i've longed to see this
[1:49:47] i guess where i could walk in the back
[1:49:49] door front door wherever it was look
[1:49:51] across an audience and see a perfect
[1:49:53] church all in order
[1:49:56] sin couldn't stay there
[1:49:59] no the spirit would call it out you see
[1:50:01] it just couldn't stay like ananias and
[1:50:03] fire you just couldn't do it there'd be
[1:50:06] no sin in that that group no sir see the
[1:50:08] spirit quickly speak it like that
[1:50:11] no matter what it was how little it
[1:50:13] would be done see women men sitting
[1:50:15] there under the power of the holy spirit
[1:50:17] the spirit of god moving perfectly
[1:50:19] moving this someone had done something
[1:50:21] wrong in the congregation couldn't they
[1:50:23] couldn't they come quickly and confess
[1:50:25] it before the spirit got a hold of it to
[1:50:27] confess it before they come to tell it
[1:50:29] because they know right then it's going
[1:50:31] to be called that's right that's the
[1:50:33] church of the living god how many old
[1:50:35] poor old how my old poor old heart now
[1:50:39] is getting old how i've longed to stand
[1:50:41] and see a church like that i may yet i
[1:50:43] hope to perfect works of god without sin
[1:50:46] now that could understand
[1:50:49] brother branham was looking for a church
[1:50:51] that had perfectly come to order
[1:50:55] i don't think he was looking for a
[1:50:56] church that had such a strict pastor and
[1:50:58] harsh deacons that they got everything
[1:51:00] just right
[1:51:03] because you could with a harsh pastor
[1:51:05] and strict and deacons you could ever
[1:51:07] get everybody in their sunday best
[1:51:09] sitting in the sea all in rows paying
[1:51:12] attention not whispering and not talking
[1:51:14] but inside
[1:51:17] that's right
[1:51:18] because the the pastor and the deacon
[1:51:20] use the wolf nature to get the people
[1:51:22] inside and all they're going to bring
[1:51:23] out is a wolf nature out of the people
[1:51:27] but it takes a shepherd's nature to get
[1:51:29] a sheep in position
[1:51:33] it's a different nature
[1:51:35] it takes the nature of the shepherd
[1:51:37] who's gentle who leads who who
[1:51:39] cooperates with the sheep
[1:51:42] it takes a shepherd's nature and brother
[1:51:44] branham is looking for a church that's
[1:51:46] all in order not rigid by rules not
[1:51:49] stiff and harsh amen not forcing but
[1:51:52] where there's a harmony a unity where
[1:51:55] everybody brings themselves in order
[1:52:00] and the spirit of god keeps them in
[1:52:03] order
[1:52:05] because we have the same focus
[1:52:07] the same purpose the same attitude the
[1:52:09] same desire
[1:52:15] god
[1:52:18] help us
[1:52:19] to understand god's order
[1:52:23] i want god's order in my private life
[1:52:26] i want it in my home
[1:52:28] i want it in the church i attend i want
[1:52:31] it in the bride globally i want god's
[1:52:33] order because i'm looking to put the
[1:52:35] word in preeminence i'm looking for his
[1:52:37] presence to remain with us
[1:52:39] that's the whole desire of our heart and
[1:52:42] that's the whole purpose of god's order
[1:52:44] every time god had order he dwelt there
[1:52:48] when god had order and eden he could
[1:52:50] come down in the cool of the evening and
[1:52:51] fellowship with his children when god
[1:52:54] had order in the camp of israel he could
[1:52:56] dwell in that tabernacle and they could
[1:52:58] see it by a pillar of fire and a cloud
[1:53:00] when they had order amen in solomon's
[1:53:02] kingdom and he brought the temple the
[1:53:04] order god could dwell right there amen
[1:53:06] when god had order in the first church
[1:53:08] he could dwell right amongst him
[1:53:11] i want to come to god's order because i
[1:53:12] want to be the place where he can dwell
[1:53:15] i want to be the place where his feet
[1:53:17] can rest
[1:53:20] i like to finish with this quote
[1:53:23] out of the rapture
[1:53:25] so then i heard something like on when
[1:53:27] christian soldiers i looked and here
[1:53:29] come that sainted bunch of little girls
[1:53:30] just exactly the way they was all
[1:53:32] correctly dressed their hair hanging way
[1:53:34] down on their back smooth clean marching
[1:53:37] like this to the step of the gospel
[1:53:39] she was the word
[1:53:41] they looked like one out of every nation
[1:53:43] i was looking at it as they passed by
[1:53:45] and i seen them pass by instead of going
[1:53:47] down they started going up
[1:53:49] and i noticed one of them trying two or
[1:53:51] three of them trying getting out of line
[1:53:53] i screamed stay in line and the vision
[1:53:55] left me and i was standing in the room
[1:53:57] screaming stay in line
[1:53:59] stay in line
[1:54:02] what was the desire of the prophet
[1:54:04] amen he wanted to present
[1:54:06] amen a virgin bride to christ and see
[1:54:09] the union of the of the bride of christ
[1:54:11] in christ
[1:54:12] she had to be in order everything had to
[1:54:14] be in order amen when when when it came
[1:54:16] time for esther to present herself to
[1:54:18] the king everything had to be in order
[1:54:20] the way haggai had ordered it
[1:54:22] and it was an order it was breathtaking
[1:54:24] when it was an order it caught the
[1:54:25] attention of the king
[1:54:28] see
[1:54:29] god's given his word for a reason he
[1:54:31] sent a prophet this day with a reason
[1:54:33] for the purpose for a reason and if
[1:54:35] we'll just yield to that and submit to
[1:54:36] that god has offices for a reason god
[1:54:39] has an order a structure everything to
[1:54:41] be decently in order and all for a
[1:54:42] reason and it all focuses to one thing
[1:54:45] and our order in our life and our order
[1:54:47] and our homes and our order in our
[1:54:49] church and all comes to one thing is to
[1:54:51] give preeminence to the one who's
[1:54:52] sitting on the throne
[1:54:56] when you give preeminence to the word
[1:54:57] you're giving preeminence to him
[1:55:00] and we're here to give preeminence to
[1:55:02] him eden was ordered the church in the
[1:55:05] wilderness was ordered the new testament
[1:55:08] church was ordered and this restored
[1:55:10] bride has been put back in order
[1:55:13] and the prophet in the vision was crying
[1:55:16] the last thing he saw
[1:55:18] was her getting kind of out of step and
[1:55:20] he come to out of the vision screaming
[1:55:22] get back instead
[1:55:25] she was getting out of step with the
[1:55:26] word she had got her eyes off of the
[1:55:28] prophet
[1:55:30] on the inspection stand she started
[1:55:32] looking around at other churches and
[1:55:33] other things she got her focus in the
[1:55:35] wrong spot amen and he was screaming get
[1:55:37] back in line he was trying to get her
[1:55:39] focus back on him
[1:55:43] get back in step and i want to say as a
[1:55:45] church i want to be in step i want to be
[1:55:48] in line god help me to get back in line

[1:56:54] half-hearted effort i need his presence

[1:57:35] but i'm going to do that after the
[1:57:36] breaking of bread
[1:57:39] because i want to come and i want to get
[1:57:41] in my place in my company of 50.
[1:57:44] and i don't want anybody to waste any
[1:57:45] time getting me in position i want to be

[1:57:56] we're just going to sing get the
[1:57:57] atmosphere right i mean get the channel
[1:57:59] opened up amen and call for the minister
[1:58:01] to come minister is going to come
[1:58:02] because i want him to break that bread
[1:58:04] i'm here with need i need some bread and
[1:58:07] i want to eat til i'm full and i want to
[1:58:09] hear the minister said i didn't get to
[1:58:11] half my notes i want to know there's
[1:58:13] basketfuls left over
[1:58:17] i want to see his presence i want to
[1:58:19] recognize he's among us in the breaking
[1:58:21] of bread but i've got to do my part in a
[1:58:23] cooperation the disciples have to work
[1:58:25] with the people the people have to work
[1:58:26] with the disciples but he will give the
[1:58:28] increase
[1:58:32] and at the end of it all we can leave
[1:58:33] filled
[1:58:35] to where we can hold no more but know
[1:58:38] that that disciples got a basket full we
[1:58:40] haven't even touched yet
[1:58:45] i believe every bit of that is
[1:58:47] absolutely possible
[1:58:49] i believe it's possible for every
[1:58:50] service i believe it's possible for
[1:58:52] every gathering if we come with the
[1:58:53] right approach if we get the order right
[1:58:55] and we recognize who's on the throne and
[1:58:57] oh it's all about
[1:59:00] him my quietness my preparation my
[1:59:04] meditation my prayer it's all about
[1:59:07] giving preeminence to the word
[1:59:09] our song service or even the special
[1:59:12] that would be sung everything is about
[1:59:14] giving preeminence to the word
[1:59:17] if we all stay focused on that
[1:59:21] then i don't think he'll ever fail
[1:59:23] with whatever little bit that we have
[1:59:26] however little fish i don't care however
[1:59:28] little tiny the fish is
[1:59:31] or what little tiny biscuit we got
[1:59:34] if we all come with the right approach i
[1:59:37] believe god will take the simplest of
[1:59:39] thought that he put in a preacher's
[1:59:41] heart
[1:59:42] two little biscuits five little fish
[1:59:46] he may have two scriptures and five
[1:59:47] quotes
[1:59:52] and i believe in before our eyes he'll
[1:59:54] break and break and break and break and
[1:59:58] break
[2:00:00] and the preacher will say i'm just going
[2:00:02] to stop there
[2:00:04] can't go no further
[2:00:06] we're all so full we're about to pop
[2:00:11] i hope that you have a better
[2:00:12] understanding of church order
[2:00:15] it's not legalism friends throw the
[2:00:17] legalistic id out the window
[2:00:20] if one of our brothers would encourage
[2:00:22] you
[2:00:23] now we might want to go in
[2:00:25] he's not upset with you
[2:00:27] he's not punishing you
[2:00:29] he's got this focus in his mind
[2:00:32] and there are times that we get out of
[2:00:34] focus
[2:00:36] that we lose track of time that we
[2:00:38] forget where we're at that we get things
[2:00:40] out of order every one of us have done
[2:00:42] it
[2:00:43] and we'll do it again and if a brother
[2:00:44] just comes and stands next to you and
[2:00:46] you know why he's standing there just
[2:00:47] say god bless your brother and get into
[2:00:49] the sanctuary
[2:00:52] because we all got to cooperate for the
[2:00:54] same thing
[2:00:56] we're all here pulling for the same
[2:00:58] thing
[2:00:59] because i believe god will do exactly
[2:01:01] what the prophet said he will do
[2:01:03] i believe he'll do exactly what he's
[2:01:05] always done when his people get in order
[2:01:07] give him the preeminence
[2:01:09] and i want to see him do it again
[2:01:11] and again
[2:01:12] and again
[2:01:13] and again
[2:01:16] praise god i hope you're full
[2:01:19] got a little bit left in my basket we'll
[2:01:21] save it for next time
[2:01:23] let's all stand
[2:01:24] musicians if you could come
[2:01:28] brother ben if you make your way up
[2:01:30] let's just bow our heads and pray
[2:01:34] lord jesus we thank you for the
[2:01:36] privilege lord of being here
