[Applause] [Music] this [Music] [Music] fear [Laughter] fill it up [Music] so good to be here with you this evening let's take our bibles while we're standing together and we'll go right to the word amen we're going to take our bibles and turn to genesis chapter 2. we'll start there we're going to continue on with religion versus relationship this is part 10 i believe and i'd like to minister on free will not self-will it's an evident self-evident title free will not self-will amen those are two very different things genesis chapter 2 let's begin at verse 16. and the lord god commanded man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that you eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now in an initial reading of this you can look at this and it almost looks as if god is attaching a punishment to a breaking of the commandment but i don't know that that is exactly the way that we should read this i believe it was a warning from god because god knew the consequences of eating that tree it wasn't that god wanted to give a commandment so that he could give a punishment if god gave a commandment because he knew if they partook of that tree what would go they would die they would die spiritually and they would begin to die physically so he was warning his son against the tree he was not setting something up so that he could bring punishment because the commandments of god are not just so that he can bring punishment because he delights in punishment but it's a warning amen stay away from this this is not right this is not good so let's read that again in verse 16 in the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shalt surely die amen let's turn over to chapter 3 verse 6. and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food now she is now taking what god has given for her protection and through the through the subtility of the serpent he's now got her to look at this tree in a different light and now she begins to look and see that it was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise see god never said it wasn't pleasant to the eyes he never said it wasn't good for food he never said it wasn't one to make you wise he though all those things could be true amen but what god had told him was still the ultimate truth it was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons let's go ahead and bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we come to you lord because we need you we come because we love you lord we've come to this time god because you've drawn us because your grace has brought us to this place in this hour and awakens something inside of us that loves you and wants more of you god as you've brought us to this place to feed us we now come lord expecting and ask lord that you would break the bread of life for us and give us the portion we need well you would have preeminence and that you would speak and that we would rejoice in your word we ask that you would move everything out of the way that would be an obstacle or a hindrance in our lives and may we feast with you in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can have your seeds so we see that in the garden of eden god had only given one commandment to man and that commandment was given to man to warn him away from the consequences of partaking of that tree and and now under the temptation that the woman was facing with the serpent she began to reconsider the tree and to begin to look at it and she saw that it it really was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree desirable to make one wise i mean this was a wisdom that god didn't want her to have at least he didn't want her to have it at this time so she was she she was looking and she saw all the benefits but she failed she failed to remember the reason she wasn't supposed to eat it and the reason she wasn't supposed to eat it is because god said that the day you eat there of that day you die and the serpent put that very commandment in question saying you'll not surely die and she began to to look at it and then she partook of it and gave to her husband and he did eat also and their eyes were open and they sewed fig leaves together and and then we know when the god come walking in the cool of the evening then they begin to hide themselves so we know the story quite well by now but you realize that godhead in the garden of eden had perfect fellowship with his son and his son's wife and god was coming down in the cool of the evening to fellowship with his children and enjoying that fellowship and they were so enjoying it likewise and god wanted this fellowship god created eden to be this way he desired this kind of fellowship but as soon as they broke the commandment fellowship was broken and immediately religion began so you can see that religion begins with broken fellowship religion begins with broken fellowship because if you're in if you're in fellowship and relationship with god you don't need religion because religion is a covering amen and the religion that adam made was a covering to hide his sin and actually cause him to hide himself from the presence of the lord so you know religion became the barrier amen to being in the presence of god and it became a barrier to the relationship and now now god was going to have to come down in order to restore relationship restore the fellowship with his children he's going to have to slay an innocent lamb and he's going to have to give a blood sacrifice amen so he can clothe them in the skin so he can restore the fellowship back again because god wants the relationship not the religion so when the relationship was broken religion set in and so religion is a sign of broken relationship broken fellowship so religion is sold to people i say sold i mean i mean presented it's presented to people as a way to fellowship with god or to way to have a relationship with god but the very religion itself is a sign of broken relationship broken fellowship so we know that's not what god desires amen what god desires is fellowship with his children and that's what god has tried to restore in this day as a fellowship back to himself amen where he and you can be persons together amen and so we thank god for this but we see now that that adam and eve were placed on free moral agency they had free will they could choose whether they would take this tree or not take this tree god didn't fence off the tree he didn't have cherubims around the tree to prevent them from coming to the tree he gave them their choice you can partake of the tree of life or you can partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and they could choose which one they wanted to partake of because god set it up that way so there was free will so there was free choice but they were never to use free choice or free will to exercise self-will and that's what we see with the woman here when the woman began to analyze the tree and she began to question what god had said and began to look at the tree she begins to lust for these things and has lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the pride of life and as she begins lust begins to awaken inside of her her self-will begins to exercise and she protects she has free choice she has free will and she uses her free will to justify or to satisfy self-will amen and that's the trap of the devil is to use your free will to satisfy self-will in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed prophet of god says now oh the great revelation now how to restore back his kinship to bring back now he had to let them get lost you understand him he had to let them sin put them on free moral he he could not make them sin and remain god and then punish them for something he made them do but when he put man on partnership with him partnership with him then let man act as a free moral agency the same thing he's got you on today see you act any way you want to you're a free moral agent so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place but everybody is on the same basis so when when god put man on partnership with him he made him a free moral agent so your free moral agency is putting you in partnership with god and you realize that god took his entire expression when he began to express himself he was going to build a masterpiece and this masterpiece was going to be a reflection of him because he was going to make man in his image and he made a beautiful setting to set the masterpiece and he said in in and in eddie put a garden in in the east in eden and then in there he placed his son and out of his son he pulled a rib and he made a wife a counterpart and he put the two together and he placed him in there and he said it is very good now he had finished his masterpiece the image that he had in his mind the desire of his heart he had made it and he had placed it and now he went and entered into his rest and that was god's desire amen and god put man on free moral agency in this so that man could continue to fellowship with god and express god and god said it that way because we know man had to fall because there was a plan of redemption god wanted to be a savior so god set him on free moral agency but he's never changed his plan he's kept us the same way but when god set this masterpiece in this garden of eden everything he created and everything he made and placed in position and all his delight and all his joy he placed in the hands of a man with free moral agency and when that man and his wife made the wrong choice and broke the commandment and brought death everything that god made his masterpiece and everything fell into ruin because god had placed it into the hands of his son so you see what power i'd say like this way what power is in free choice what power is in free moral agency that once god set man up in partnership with him and free moral as a free moral agent he could choose which way he wanted god was not going to prevent him from choosing the wrong tree he could choose and what power to take everything that god made and bring death into it and bring it into ruin and chaos and perversion by a choice of a man and we still are under this same free moral agency to make our choice in the message paradox he said you're on the same basis as adam and eve was you can if god put you on anything else it would be unjust to adam and eve each adam each adam and eve tonight has got the right and wrong setting before them you can make your choice you can take god's word or leave god's word you can take god's word or take your denominational creeds about him you can take your modernistic ideas of what it is you can be born again and filled with the holy ghost or you can be church-eyes either one you want to be but see there's a power when a son of god takes free moral agency and he begins to exert self-will there's still a power that comes with that amen there's still chaos that breaks out there's still destruction there's still perversion but there's got to be a people on the earth at the end time that are going to take the free moral agency and not use it not free will to exercise self-will but free will with the option to sacrifice self-will not by force but by free will by free moral agency if it was free choice that brought destruction it'll be free choice of the children of god that bring it back to a restoration there is power in this free moral agency when god has put us on partnership he put man on partnership with him and he hasn't taken away free moral agency the devil can still trip a son and daughter of god that son or daughter of god can still choose to walk away from the word and when that son or daughter of god chooses to walk away from the world a word is still brings the same results it brings death it brings destruction but we've been given amen by by the blood of jesus christ a path of redemption to come back in repentance but it still it still is a powerful thing i had a man that i i worked with one time he he told me he was getting a little bit hostile towards christianity and he didn't think that he believed in god and he and he said if if god is so good amen why does god allow children to be abused in murders and i don't know what all he cited but you know how it is you've heard the routine before if god is so good why does he do that and i looked at him i said you know god because man broke his covenant man has done this to himself god didn't do it when god made was perfect man did this and i said and the fact is i said when you yourself refuse to follow the word of god you're perpetuating the perversion and the murder and the child molestation it's your fault now not adam and eve and not gods everybody wants to look back and say oh you know i remember somebody smarted off one time and said when i get to heaven i'm going to talk to adam what about you today are you perpetuating what adam did are you continuing the cycle of destruction and defeat amen amen because in the seventh seal the prophet of god says that the devil can get one of his subjects to let down on one word he's got victory over the word of god amen but there's going to come a time he doesn't have victory over the word of god anymore because god is raising up a people who will use free will to surrender self-will so people want to get angry about what's going on but they don't want to obey god's word they want to talk about how horrible things are and how perverted and how but they don't realize the more you break the commandment of god the more you use free will amen to exercise self-will and so fulfill the lust of the flesh you are continuing to make the problem worse so we always want to blame somebody else but now it's our fault this is the day that we live in this is the time this is the hour and we have an opportunity now let's turn to second timothy chapter four ii timothy 4 and 2. just preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears that means they want to satisfy the itch they want the teacher to give them something that they want to hear and they shall turn away their ears from truth and shall be turned unto fables you say oh what a horrible thing to happen no it's exactly what they wanted to happen this is what they're saying you know you say oh those poor people that are being deceived do you realize that a big giant portion of the people that are being deceived want to be deceived they've heaped to themselves teachers having itching ears they they are they're hearing what they want to hear they're hearing you're okay you're fine god loves you god would never this to you god would never that to you that's exactly what eve wanted to hear and when she began to hear that she began to consider what he was saying so they they they heaped to themselves teachers having itching ears and are turned from the truth unto fables and you say oh how sad they got exactly what they wanted they didn't want the truth they wanted to hear something amen that was appealing that would satisfy the self-will people many times people who get deceived are so willing to get deceived i mean that sounds horrible but if you've ever known of anybody that's been part of a pyramid scheme or a get rich quick scheme or some money making thing amen and you know maybe some of us have gotten trapped into that or segments of it or whatever but you realize at the end of the day you realize that the the picture that they painted wasn't the wasn't what we were getting amen i mean all of a sudden if you drink this juice you're going to be free of cancer and you're not going to have any heart problems you're not going to have this and if it works for you it'll work for your neighbor and you can sell it to your brother and your sister and your mother and your aunt and then you can have all yours free and if you really do a good job not only will you get your free you can get income and i know somebody over here he started this two years ago and this is his full-time job am i the only one who's ever heard a story like that it's phone cards and juices and vitamins and oils and whatever else and people jump in they jump in not because that juice has any property that changes anything they drink it and they feel great you know why they feel great because they're going to quit their job in a month and they're going to be independently wealthy and never need to work again not it's not the juice that's doing anything they have an itchy ear amen and they're willing to believe a fable because they want the fable to be true is that true and the next thing you know you can have a sweep through a church where everybody's trying to sell everybody their product can i have a show for you can i have no i've already she's having a show and i amen and what is it we we want it's the allure amen of satisfying the flesh of getting to quit work being financially independent not having to do this getting you see and then we're willing to really believe ridiculous things about this product that'll revolutionize and save my life and heal my whole family and whatever else it's supposed to do and see without any and without any real proof without any real evidence we'll latch onto something like that because human beings fundamentally at the core are all the same and these things work over and over and over again they'll just change the product they'll change the some of the terminology but it'll be the same thing amen it's just the same thing over and over again because what happens is the allurement of satisfaction of the flesh amen of fulfilling the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life will cause us amen to believe something that's nonsense because we want it to be true because i want the reward that they're promising and if it works for a money-making scheme it's the same exact tactic in religion amen they want to be okay they want to be able to live any way they want amen run up into this tower sing with the angels let the judgment pass and come back out of the tower they want the religion they want the religion to work you know all you have to do is come and take communion and if you take communion that's been blessed a certain way you're now part of the body of christ and christ is in you and if you'll come to the confession booth and tell a man your sin and then you'll do what he says as far as so many rosary be so many this so many that then your sins will all be forgiven you amen it's not biblical it's absolute nonsense but they want it to be true and eve now wanted this to be true and millions have wanted it to be true so they've heaped to themselves teachers having itchy ears and turned the truth into a fable and they liked the fable better than the truth but praise god he's got a predestinated seed brother ma'am said lot as he had to make a choice abraham give lot his choice and god gives you your choice choose you this day who you shall serve in the garden of eden there was a tree of knowledge and a tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you're given your privilege as a free moral agent to choose whatever you want to choose praise god let's turn to the book of esther if i've been given a free moral agency if i've been given the right to choose i want to be careful how i exercise my right to choose because god's not going to take that away and so i i want to be very careful i'd like to look here at the story of esther esther chapter 2 verse 3. and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushen the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hagie the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so so we find out there's a decree going out vashti we know had refused to come to the king's bidden bidding she had a feast she was having her own feast when the king was having a feast she was having her own feast the feast of the women amen and vastly is a type of the catholic church and she's there with all the women the denominations they're having their own feasts and won't come to the king's feast but there's a king's feast going on today friends and you're bidding to come to the king's feast but vashti and all the women has refused keeping their own feast of the world council churches and and all of that nonsense but now he's going to he's going to send out a decree to gather the fair young virgins because he's going to find going to find one but but they said let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti all this is so important they weren't looking for the most beautiful the most intelligent the most talented they were going to begin looking for the maiden that pleaseth the king amen and that's what god is doing today he's gathering the maiden that pleaseth the king amen because there's one person that needed to be pleased in all of this and that was the king let's go look at verse 12. now when every maid's turn was come to go into king azaris after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to whit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purification of the women then thus came every maiden to the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house so in verse 13 you can see that now they're they've been they went through a 12-month purification process six months of merch six months of aloes and spices and and fragrances and now they're going to get to go one by one and present themselves and to the king and as they go they're given free moral agency they're given free choice thus came every maiden to the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women and to the king's house whatever she wanted to take she could take whatever she thought amen would be appropriate whatever she thought would be for beautification or for presentation whatever she thought whatever she desired she was able to take it it was given to her for her night when she went and present herself to the king so i want you to see these maidens were given free choice they could take whatever they desired whatever they thought whatever they felt like would be the best thing and it was a test we're going to find in the scriptures that it's a test verse 14 in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned to the second house of the women to the custody of shasgas the king's chamberlain which kept the concubine she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she recalled by name now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed haggai is a type of the prophet of the age brother branham amen as he prepares the bride to go in to meet the king and now under the purification amen all of these virgins now they're going to go and present themselves now remember they're all virgins they're all virgins there's been 10 virgins amen they're all virgins they're going to present themselves to the king and they're given free choice free will to take whatever they desired would be given to them to take before the king amen to dress the way they wanted to dress the perfume the whatever whatever it was that they were going to do to present themselves to king they could do it of their own will but when esther came she required nothing but what that prophet told her was the right garment to wear because this prophet this haggai in this generation amen he's been here to watch over the purification of the virgins he's been here to make sure they were presented right and he's been here to instruct you amen to instruct you and he says he says he's going to take he said let this be the crowning of my ministry to take the cloth of the word and clothe the bride and he's given us for our clothing the word amen we've been adorned by the word of god we've been dressed by the correct teaching amen the restoration of the truth amen but all of these virgins they can take before the king anything their heart desires whatsoever they desire it was given to them but there was one little virgin that didn't want anything other than what that prophet said she didn't want her own thinking she didn't want her own mind she didn't want to make it prettier she didn't want to make it smell nicer because there was a secret with haggai and esther was able to catch the secret the secret was none of these virgins had been to the inner chamber with the king before but haggai knew the king haggai knew what the king liked haggy haggai knew the desires of the king amen and there was one virgin amongst all the virgin that recognized he knows what he's talking about my own idea is worthless i don't know what i'm talking about but there was a prophet who was able to tap into the back part of god's mind and knows what god has been looking for he could tell us what the heart desire of god has been all along and that's to have a bride of his own choosing and there was a test and the test was you can take anything you want you could just imagine what was at their disposal if you can just imagine if they had 12 months of purifications with all these uh myrrh and aloes and all these spices and all this and then they had they i mean esther alone was given seven maidens to help in her preparation could you imagine what was available it was a modern laodicea anything you want is here anything your heart desires is available you can watch anything look at anything learn anything nearly buy anything whatever you want it's here whatever flavor you want to worship god in if you want it legalistic you can have it if you want it liberal you can have it if you want it loud and exciting you can have it if you want it still in quiet you can have it you can have it any flavor you want any doctrine you want you can have it so what will you choose these virgins were going in and they were going back to the house of the concubines but there was one that would go and when she presented herself to the king it stopped right there let's read this now when the turn verse 15 again when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for her daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the woman appointed keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her she did not adorn herself with her own desire or her own thinking whatsoever she exerted none of her own will she used her free choice to do she used her free choice to deny herself will and take what hegei i said esther obtained favor in the sight of them all all that looked upon her i would say there's no way to dress this bride better than heggy eye has said to dress this bride all that saw her they marveled all that saw her looked upon her and she found favor with all of them amen it didn't say this of any of the other virgins that took whatever they desired they were piecing together whatever they thought oh i think he'll like this and i think that will be all right and i think this and i think that then all she was doing was dressing herself the way she liked to be dressed because she didn't know the king she hadn't met the king she didn't know what the king wanted the only way she would know what the king wanted was to get it from haggai but these virgins weren't listening to haggai they were over here dabbling with their own desire their own will their own lust and i'd like to wear pearls and i think i'd like to have my hair this way and i think this perfume is nice and i i think this will be all right do i look good who are you asking hacky eye or another virgin that doesn't have a clue what the king wants this is okay don't you think this looks good who are you asking [Music] amen but haggy i knew what the king was after haggy i knew i mean he had seen vashti he had seen the court he had knew what went on there hey man he understood and now esther she doesn't have any of her own thinking she doesn't exercise any of her free choice for her own will she surrenders her will to what haggy i instructed and when she surrenders and submits to the leadership that she's been placed under when she presents herself to the king the king says that's the one i want it goes on to say so esther was taking it to the king ahazeras verse 16 unto his house royal in the 10th month which is the month tibeth in the seventh year she goes in and 10-7 in the seventh year of his reign and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti what was it he loved he loved somebody who could choose whatever they wanted to choose and she would choose what would be pleasing to the king because remember the decree went out and said let the virgin that please the king be queen instead of vashti and every other virgin had come before esther wasn't pleasing the king she was pleasing herself or her friends how many churches are trying to impress other churches how many are trying to out sing out preach outperform out member do you think there wasn't competition amongst those virgins i mean the one who leaves you know and her hair is just out of place in the back nobody else is telling her that my turn's tomorrow night you see what i'm saying friends and all these no matter you know the world is the world is the world and people as people as people i'd ask you if we did the same kind of pageant today and gathered all the fair young virgins and said you're going to be queen over a vast empire one of the vastest that's ever been on the face of the earth with all the riches and all that go with it i mean you've got to go through this purification process you'll be given everything you'll be weighted on hand and foot and you can take anything you want to the king what do you think that house would be like how much backbiting and whispering and murmuring and i mean i'm not trying to be mean against women but these worldly women they're in competition with each other trying to out beautify outperform be the next one and they're in competition with each other but they're not worried about pleasing the king they're just trying to compete with one another i say god help us to never get into a rut like that amen let's listen to what haggai said haggai knows what the king wants let's surrender our will you can have anything you want i don't want anything i want to be pleasing to that king because the only way that i'm going to get the crown and i'm going to get the title is if i'm pleasing to him so all the other virgins go out pleasing themselves satisfying themselves competing and trying to outdo one of the other virgins and they all come and they all go and they come and they go and they come and they go but when esther stepped forth who required nothing but what haggai had required had appointed she didn't put anything extra on the message she didn't add to it she didn't doctor up the word she didn't add to the message she didn't make it nicer she didn't make it prettier she didn't make it smell better she just took exactly what haggai appointed and when she stepped forth she found favor in the eyes of everyone because that was real beauty and the real beauty of esther was not her skin the real beauty of esther was her character because he had the king azares had beauty because vashti was stunning when he called for vastu to come he called for her so that she might present herself so that all can look upon her beauty he already had beauty amen do you think you're going to out glitter the catholic church but there's a certain glow that comes with character and what esther had was far above what vashti had and what these other virgins said so esther exercised her free will to surrender all self-will and in exercising her free will to surrender self-will she was pleasing to the king and she was positioned as queen instead of asking this is why brother branham says the way up is down everybody else was trying so hard all she did was what haggai said brother brahm says in the god of this evil age he said the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses or five senses rather the inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience and love and so forth the outside man see tastes feel smell here but the inside of that spirit is a soul when it's controlled by one thing your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept what god says and that'll determine what spirit is in there if it's in the spirit of god it'll feed on the things of god and it won't feed on anything of the world jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of god is not even entered into the inner part satan has deceived you and a man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god turn with me to isaiah 14. we've read this recently but i'd like to pick it up again right here isaiah 14. in verse 12. isaiah 14 12 how art thou fallen from heaven a lucifer son of the morning howarth thou cut down to the ground which is weak in the nations for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend i will self-will see lucifer also was had a free choice is that right he chose to rebel and so did his angels with him thou has said in thine heart i will ascend unto heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit that expression of self-will amen against the will of god it comes right from lucifer it's an attribute of the devil himself but esther never had that in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed there's another one the night if you didn't get the tape i preached here one night on a prisoner of jesus christ paul a prisoner see when god gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do paul with all of his great intellects he he was taught by gamaliel to be a great priest or rabbi someday and he had high ambitions he was intellectual great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it see to become part of the word to express jesus christ he knowed what it was to say he had a notion to go over someplace some some brethren had called him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will oh if people half spiritual can pick that up see he was forbidden to do his own will he could only the spirit forbid me see he was a prisoner to christ then this little fortune teller one day who he knowed paul knowed he had power to cast that devil out she was tormenting him following him around the city crying these men be sent from god and it was it was a burdensome it was a bother to paul and he knew that he had the power to cast that devil out but he couldn't do it unless god said do it see lucifer wanted to exert his own will but paul learned to surrender his will to the will of god but he could only do it as god willed it day after day she followed him crying out after him but one day the spirit gave him permission then he rebuked her the spirit that was in there see he knowed what it was to be a prisoner when paul thought that he had authority and he thought that he had power when he had letters from the high priest to persecute the children of god and he did have a realm of power and uncertain authority and he could haul them to prison and even have them beaten all kinds of things but god that was a false authority that was a false power but god was going to bring him to a real power and a real authority as the apostle of god and the apostle to the gentiles but he was going to have to surrender everything and die out and exercise his free will to give up exercises free choice to give up all self-will and when he did god would take him after he was a base and god would lift him up now in his hands and he would have real power and real authority and real jurisdiction in the kingdom of god paul thought he was fighting for the kingdom of god he thought he had a position in power in the kingdom of god but he didn't realize he was fighting god but when he surrendered all then he found jurisdiction and power and authority in the kingdom of god let's turn to back to genesis and go to genesis chapter 13. genesis 13-5 and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram's cattle and the herdmen of lot's cattle the canaanite and the parasite dwell in the then in the land and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then i will go to the right if and if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of jordan and it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord liked the land of egypt as thou comest and zazar then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly it comes down to a decision to a choice abraham abram mentions the law no let's not have strife the land can't bear us you pick which way you want to go and now lot he doesn't consider god he doesn't he doesn't pray amen he's willing to separate from abraham who is the chosen and elect of god and how does he make his choice he makes his choice by looking for what's the most beautiful what's the most well-watered where can he have the easiest life and where can he benefit the most i wonder how many times we make choices that way looking out but you know when he looked out and he said he looked out and he saw the planes and he saw this and they had journeyed in the land for some time they knew the cities they knew the people they knew the conditions amen in this in and the bible says that the men of sodom were exceedingly wicked and lot knew it already but he was willing to go down there near that city because it was well watered because it would produce good you know good good for his flocks and good crops he could benefit from all of those things he was willing amen to leave the plane to leave separation and mingle down into the world and move his tit towards sodom for personal gain and personal carnal benefits he had free choice we have free choice but how many people have chosen a carnal choice for benefit and blessing over staying separated to the word of god better job in a place that takes me from church a better job that will move me to a place amen that there's no good church no local church no no place to fellowship no believers of fellowship or will just take me away from the house of god because of the schedule but when you look we see it's well watered and it's got a good place for cattle it's nice this and nice that and it's nice that you say butt butt butt he already knew that they were exceedingly wicked in sodom and he ends up losing some of his children in sodom because he wanted self-will he wanted personal gain we need to analyze our decisions sometimes why do we make the choices we make why did we decide to do this amen we have a right for free choice absolutely god's given you that right you can make free choice but why do we make the decisions we make do we make it because of what haggai said or do we make it because of what i want we can all say amen because we're equally guilty there's a carnality there's a carnal side that wants to be comforted and wants to be well taken care of and wants to benefit and profit and have an easier life and all these other things and we've got to be careful about why we make the decisions we make and really analyze our decisions and say why am i doing this what am i presenting am i trying i mean am i trying to preserve myself or am i laying my life down for for him so i can be pleasing to him that's why brother branham said he could change his doctrine sure and he could have big crowds and he could have an easier way to go but he told us i would rather eat soda crackers and drink branch water and be right with the lord so i think it behooves us sometimes because we have a right a free choice that we analyze our choices and we line them to the word and we remember what haggy i said what did haggai say about this what is pleasing to the king how does the king want my hair what did he say was the fragrance that i should take what color did haggy i say i remember that one day we were walking along and haggai told me he said wear that ribbon when you go see the king and esther might have been like i wouldn't have picked that ribbon but whatever you say because you know i think we need to be more careful about our decisions because there's a relationship at stake all of these women they were going to have an opportunity to have a relationship with the king like few could have to be his queen but they were so interested in satisfying themselves they all missed out on the relationship but the one who would not satisfy herself was the one who had the relationship and the relationship would would equal salvation for her people these things are important the devil is no less wily today than he was when he spoke to eve through the serpent he tripped her up by her own lusts and he tries to trip us up by our own lusts let's turn to first kings first kings 18. first kings 18 and in verse chapter 18 verse 21 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but of baal then follow him and the people would answered him not a word i think this is interesting elijah's bringing him to a showdown he's bringing them to a meeting place and you can see here that the problem in israel is a blended religion it's a mixing because he says you're halting between two opinions you're not saying jehovah's god you're not saying barolo's god you're serving both and he's trying to bring him down to a decision amen because in the time that elijah is going to appear for a mount carmel showdown in the end time there's going to be a mixture amen of idolatry and christianity there's going to be a blending of religion amen a man-made religion with the word of god a hybridization amen and elijah's going to bring it to a question amen are you going to serve jehovah are you going to serve baal you decide you pick and they said nothing they didn't want to pick they didn't want to choose they wanted to stay right there and the message the marriage of the lamb probably says so many says that the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him but that's up to you you've got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made herself ready i like that worm you see god could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessings blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god the decisions we make shows our faith and respects to god let's turn to joshua 24. and verse 14. joshua 24-14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in the sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord and if it's him evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord joshua was bringing it down to a decision because you've got to make a decision amen and joshua wasn't waiting to see what they decided he was telling them up front what he decided he said you choose are you going to serve the gods with your father served up in egypt you're going to serve the gods in the lands of the amorites are you going to serve jehovah amen you pick but he said i'm not waiting for you to decide i'm telling you what i already decided as for me and my house we will serve the lord that's the way we have to make our decision in elijah's day when elijah was telling them to make their decision they didn't say a word they were going to wait and see how the showdown went and after and after the fire came down and licked up the water and consumed the stones and consumed everything then they chased down the prophets of baal and helped elijah kill them amen but they didn't say anything before i say now is the time to make our decision not later but now let's turn to genesis 24 now genesis 24 and 10. this is leaser going to fetch a bride for isaac in verse 10 he says and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia into the city of nehor and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that the women go out to draw water he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down my picture i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say shall say drink and i will give thy camel's drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou has showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebecca came out which was born of bethul son of milk of the wife of nehorn abram's abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her picture and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water out of that pitcher she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done give him drink she said i will draw water for the camels also until they have done drinking and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again into the well to draw water and drew for all his camels so god had go well abraham had sent eliezer eliezer went out to fetch a bride and he prays the prayer and he said lord the damsel that comes and i ask for a drink but also will water my camels let her be the one that you've appointed so she already proved that she was the appointed one but she's still going to have to come to a time of decision let's go to paragraph 54. i mean sorry paragraph 24 verse 54. sorry genesis 24 54. this man goes he goes into their home he's been invited in and it says in in verse 54 and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with them and they tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away to my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at least ten after that she shall go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing that the lord has prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master and they said we will call the damsel inquire at her mouth and they called rebecca and said unto her without go with this man and she said i will go see although she was ordained although before the foundation of the world rebecca was going to be the one it still came to rebecca to make her decision she had to make a clear-cut decision and she made a decision quickly and brother bam said in the super in a super sign he said notice eliezer found the woman he knowed that was her and notice he had to deal with two people her mother and her brother the father rest of them had nothing to say mother and brother so has the messenger the holy ghost of god in this last days picking out the bride he's had to deal with the church that's called itself the mother the catholic church and the brother the preacher that's exactly he had to deal with those two they was the one that kicked up a fuss about it brother brown is now typing this with his own ministry then he's saying now the messenger at the end time which he said was the holy ghost had to deal with two forces had to deal with the mother and had to deal with the brother that tried to hold her back but now he said you got to make your choice will you go and look quickly as soon as she heard about isaac before she had ever saw him she said i will go why she was a blood relative to him see what was abraham's that was abraham's brother's child isaac and rebecca were first cousins blood relations showing that the church in the last days will be a blood relation to christ for the very god that predestinated the christ was the lamb slain before the foundation of the earth the church itself its name was put on the book before the foundation of the world and rebecca as soon as she heard of isaac there was something in her that pulled her straight to him though she hadn't seen her or nothing she yet wanted to go by her own choice away from her mother and her brother i said praise god she made a decision quickly before she saw the end of the matter before she was she saw what she looked like because she was of the same blood relations amen she would whatever family isaac was she was and when she heard it she said that's what i want i will go she didn't have to wait and the message identification he said then if they do you were with god and his thoughts at the beginning how can you deny his word being true when you are part of his word you are blood relations you are the same family you come from the same place amen where did you come from from the mind of god you've come from the same place you're of the same family your blood relations so when you hear it there's something in you amen you can make your decision quickly you don't have to wait to see what the end of the matter is because there's a life inside of you there's something in you because your blood relations when you hear eleazar make the call although my church and preacher tried to hold you back you said i'll go he said this is all the way back in 1956 the prophet of god says faith is what you do not see it's what you believe you don't need to see it but there's something inside of you sees there's something inside of you sees it and that's god that's inside something inside of you sees the truth he said that's god that's inside sees his own word being made manifest your blood relation something in you sees the word may manifest what is that that's in you that sees it amen it's invisible to these eyes but what's in it it's god that's in you that sees it he says in all this is back in 1955 and jehovah jair said his faith didn't fail he didn't stagger reached over and got his son tied his hands in his feet his only beloved son god in abraham you see it god in abraham you see god told abraham take thy son thine only son amen and abraham was here typing the father that would sacrifice his only son and it was showing jesus christ coming but it wasn't just abraham it was god in abraham god could take his own word through abraham to trust himself it was god and abraham there was a part of god and abraham there was an attribute of god in abraham there was a germ of life of god in abraham and through abraham god could believe his own word it's not what you and i have done amen there's something in us amen we come from the same source we're going back to the same source we have the same father the same origin there's a something an attribute inside of us that when you see it god through the bride can believe the word rebecca although her family they him hold around and want to hold back but rebecca amen was the same blood relation as isaac and when she saw it she said i'll go in the message trying to do god of service he said and if the bride is to be the word then she's got to be of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for this day the the not not the word for his day the word of this day you catch that she's got to be part of their bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for his day the word of this day that he promised would be this day that he sent his word forth to mold his bride and maker hope we see it don't get some idea of your own now and don't take somebody else's idea take the vindicated word here the bible it says god has promised in his word how he would choose his bride in the last day did you know that he promised how he would do it and that by his original plan of choosing christ of choosing the times choosing the seasons he can't miss it on his bride because she is part of that word he can't choose it by denomination when he didn't choose christ by a denomination did christ come to a denomination did he come by the nomination no they rejected him well that's what the denomination done then then when he when he chooses a bride can he come any other way how did he bring christ here by the word of the prophets is that right how will he bring his bride here by the word of the prophets how did he identify him when he come by a man with the spirit of elijah upon him come out of the wilderness how will he identify his bride he promised in malachi 4 the same thing before he destroyed the earth like it was in the days of sodom she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone brother branham was answering a question in 1964 in questions and answers but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and asses and things comes right back into the place and develops the picture again the picture god had of you before the foundation of the world now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best when was it taken before there was a foundation in the world it was put in god's great file and then the only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice we had to come down god already had a picture of us he already had a completion in his mind just like he already had a rebecca but she had to make her choice he already had a mary amen and mary was going to be the wound that was going to bring forth christ he already had her chosen more than before the foundation of the world it was already prophesied 700 years before but he was going to come to mary and mary had to make her choice because god's a gentleman he doesn't force anything he predestinates but he he wants the seed to respond back to the seed and god on the inside and god in the word and the two are coming together and there's got to be a clear-cut decision there's got to be a choice and god set it up on free moral agency so that it wouldn't be by force he doesn't want it to be by force he wants it to be by love rebecca was motivated by love and she hadn't even seen isaac yet but something inside of her could already love him and brother banham said when when she saw him afar off amen and he saw her afar off he had come out in the cool of the evening to walk in the field and she was coming on the camel train and from far off they slid down he said it was love at first sight why because they were made for one another and you were made for this revealed word in this hour and this revealed word was made for you when adam saw his wife amen the moment he saw his wife he didn't have to decide do i want or do i not he said he wanted her here flesh with my flesh and bone of my bone she had come out from him rebecca could make the choice mary she could say be it unto me according to thy word you know she had to say that is that right she had to have the right to refuse to have free moral agency she had to have the right to refuse brother branham said jesus christ could have married a wife and raised children he had to make his choice and his free choice he surrendered his will to the will of the father set an example for you and i we've got to make our choice god has already predestinated absolutely it's already in the mind of god but god's not forcing the issue god wants a love relationship amen he put something on the inside that can respond to that word because he wants us to say i will go be it unto me i will go i will do i will have i will give up i want to when rebecca went with eleazar she wasn't going i said i guess if i have to you said you already prayed rebecca wasn't saying well i mean i guess do i have any choice you told me you already rebecca wanted to go mary didn't say well you're gabriel i mean i really don't want to be pregnant i really don't i mean i really don't want to mess up my plans but when she was presented with the word for her hour there was something inside of her say be it unto me according to your word but it had to be her choice she had to choose brother branham said and the message ministry explained he said you're not destroyed or separated from god because you're a sinner you're separated from god because you refused to walk with him to walk in his provided way you've got death and life before you just like adam and eve every man's free moral agent and the tree of life and the tree of death is before us all you can take either one you wish to it depends on what tree you eat off of is what you are that's right god created you a free moral agent to do whatever you want to do about it he can't make you love him he don't force you to love him if i forced my wife to love me i'd be afraid to marry her think about that statement if i forced my wife to love me i'd be afraid to marry her why because if she was forced to love you she wouldn't be faithful but you want a wife that loves you a free choice because she loves you because she wants to if i forced my wife to love me i'd be afraid to marry her but she come accepting me for what i was and married me that's right and she loved me and she accepted me that way and that's the way we got to come to god he wants us to love him and come and believe his word god is not looking for a wife that he forced into marriage he's not looking for a relationship where you have no choice because you can't trust that kind of relationship but god has in this day that we live he set it out here just like the the house of the women that hagee i was in charge of we've got any choice that you want you we can go to any church we want we can believe whatever we want yeah is that right you can next sunday this sudden you can go to any choice of church that you want to go to and you can believe anything you want to do and guess what a lightning bolt is not going to strike you dead the moment you do it because god's giving you a choice why because he's looking for that attribute that would choose him back he's all right there's a magnetism that has to take place there's an attraction that has to be there amen and it's expressed in free moral agency when you can choose what you want you can have what you want you can go where you want but when all you want is him and all you want is the word then he's found a wife that'll take him for who he is not for who she wants him to be that's why god has brought the word in this day and he is he has corrected all the fallacy of man and all the denominationalism because they've made their own husband what they want their husband to be they've made the doctrine and they've twisted the word and they've changed god and they changed christ in the image they want him to be i want him to be like this so i'll preach that he's like this i want him to have this kind of mercy and i want him to have this kind of grace and i don't want him to have this kind of judgment and i don't want him to feel this way about you know whatever and so they preach a man a husband of their own making they make a plastic husband and that's what they marry amen but god has set it up this way you can have whatever you want you can make your own plastic husband you can come up with your own doctrine you can start your own church you can start your own message church and you can doctor up the message and make it any way you want it to be because he's looking for a bride after his own heart one that he can trust completely amen completely trust so he will bring a prophet in our day to present exactly what he is this is what i am this is who i am and haggai will tell us all about the king and all about his pleasure and all about what he wants and the majority of the women were still worried about which pearls they were going to wear and whether the blue shoes are the red shoes but there was one in the crowd that was listening to haggai because she knew that in order to be that chosen one i'm going to have to please that king in the day when we can have whatever we want god doesn't take away from moral agency it's still in effect friends in fact our choice is many of us are still suffering from our choices and we say god i wish god would have stopped me from making my choices god set up free mortal agency and he's letting it ride and many of us are suffering from our choices because he's going to take the same thing free choice and he's going to prove a bride by free choice he proved esther because she could take whatever she desired into her meeting with the king and when she wanted nothing what haggai said that proves she was the one and in this day god has laid out the back part of god's mind what god wants what god expects what god likes how he wants his church to act how he wants his church to look what he wants his church to believe and he's not going to force his bride into it he laid it out here because he wants one he can trust he's looking for the one that'll please him and i say god i want to take my free choice and i want to surrender my will god has given us free will so that we can voluntarily surrender our will and prove our love to him and show our respects and our faith in god let's all stand musicians have you come this path of free choice has not gone away yet and god is still proving that he's going to have the right kind of bride and he's doing it by the choices he lets us make every day and i say when it comes time to make our next choices i know for me i just want to stop and say what did haggy i say i'm faced with a choice here i got to choose one way or the other and and you know what i'm tired of my own choices are you guys tired of your own choices i'm tired of my own choices i don't want my own choices i want to do what's pleasing to the king how do i know it's pleasing to the king he gave us a message in this day he restored the word he opened the bible to us so we know what he wants we know who he is we know what he's like we see his character we see his nature we see his demeanor and all he's wanting is a bride that will reflect that and i say god that's all i want that's all i want and that's all i want to be i don't anymore want the things that laodicea offers i'm tired of it i'm sick of satisfying the flesh i'm absolutely tired of fulfilling once what i want more than anything is to please him i say god help me let's all pray lord jesus we thank you god that in this hour that we live you're calling us out of religion into a relationship out of formality out of false doctrine false teaching false understanding out of self-will and self-love god you showed us what what you want and god that's what we want to be help us god as we surrender you have given us free moral agency and there's a power that lays in that lord it was powerful enough that when your children chose wrong it would take your beautiful creation and bring a perversion and set corruption and that would bring destruction if it's that powerful lord can the same thing be used for good oh god may we make our choices lord the line up to your word may we surrender all self-will and all self-love and lay it down at your feet may we just take your choice may we just take what you've given us in this hour and be clothed with it lord be perfumed by it and be pleasing to you take away all of our selfishness lord and all of our pride help us lord right now just to lay ourselves down and choose your word and choose your way for god i want that to be my choice if you've given me choice that's what i choose i choose to surrender all have your way with us as we go from here let us be a bright and shining light lord that we might continue to show forth your praises may others see the light that shines from us and be gathered to you lord may we point them to the source may they become connected to you again be with us and guide us lord forgive us lord for the things that we've chosen the past forgive us lord for our selfishness but i pray god that you would just continue to mold us into your very image as we surrender unto you in jesus christ's name we pray amen please [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleasing to you [Music] let everything i pursue me please [Music] [Music] see let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleased [Applause] be pleased do you remember the time brother branham was preaching and danny henry came up to him at the end of service and wrapped his arms around him and gave a prophecy over him in french and it was translated in that prophecy it says because you've chosen the harder way the narrow path and you've done this of your own choosing listen god had already foreordained it he sought before the foundation of the world do you think that prophet do you think he was going to go any other way god had already ordained it so god already saw it but god was still so pleased when he saw a man who could choose any way you want he would choose the harder way he would choose by his own choosing no force no coercion god not pushing him into it but he himself would say i'll take the narrow away i'll take the harder way it's so pleased god amen that when that man wrapped his arms around him he began to speak in perfect french and god had a u.n interpreter there and he had a woman who spoke french there and another interpreter there amen and they all gave the interpretation and it all matched god was so pleased with a man amen what was he doing he was walking in the vision god had already ordained it he was doing what god told him to do but god wasn't going to shove him in a tube and pull him out the other end and said you chose no he had his own choice to make as a man as an individual representative of a human being with the seed of god on the inside he had joyce and when he chose what was in god's mind god was delighted with his choice are we the bride of jesus christ i believe with all my heart i am has he saw me cross the finish line absolutely am i going to be perfected by the washing of the water this word i know it but
