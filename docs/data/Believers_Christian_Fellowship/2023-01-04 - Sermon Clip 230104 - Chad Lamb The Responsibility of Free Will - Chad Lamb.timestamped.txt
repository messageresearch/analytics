[0:00] because thou has chosen a narrow path
[0:02] the harder way thou has walked of your
[0:06] own choosing
[0:09] God didn't make him
[0:12] God gave him the opportunity to choose
[0:14] and he choose he chose
[0:16] but listen
[0:18] the prophet had chose wrong before and
[0:20] bore the consequences for the rest of
[0:22] his life amen he knew what it was to
[0:24] choose wrong and bear consequences but
[0:26] by the grace of God he also knew what it
[0:29] was to choose right and bear those
[0:31] consequences
[0:32] thou has chosen the Narrow Path the
[0:35] harder way thou has walked of your own
[0:37] choosing thou has picked the correct and
[0:40] precise decision God didn't pick it for
[0:43] him although it was God's perfect will
[0:44] and this Dimension he left it for him to
[0:47] make
[0:49] and he says you had made you have picked
[0:51] the correct and precise decision
[0:54] and it is my way
[0:57] because of this momentous decision
[1:03] oh this is going to bring you and I
[1:05] right into the picture
[1:07] because of this momentous decision a
[1:10] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what
[1:13] a glorious decision thou has made this
[1:17] in itself is that which will give and
[1:20] make come to pass the tremendous victory
[1:22] in love divine
[1:28] that's why we're benefactors up at one
[1:30] point the prophet of God could say my
[1:33] decision has held back the progress of
[1:35] the whole church
[1:36] but now in tongues and interpretation
[1:39] God is telling them your decision the
[1:42] correct decision the precise decision my
[1:44] way in itself amen this because of this
[1:49] momentous decision what decision the one
[1:52] the prophet made
[1:54] because of this momentous decision a
[1:56] huge portion of Heaven A Waste thee what
[1:59] a glorious decision thou has made not
[2:02] not God's not saying not I forced you or
[2:06] I did this no he's saying you chose it
[2:09] and it was the right choice and it's a
[2:10] glorious decision
[2:13] this the decision the prophet made in
[2:17] itself
[2:18] is that which will give and may come to
[2:20] pass to tremendous Victory and love to
[2:23] find

[2:29] the prophet's decision
[2:33] if it has the power for negative it has
[2:35] the power for good it has the power for
[2:37] death it has the power for life and I
[2:40] say God used my decisions for the power
[2:42] of life let my choices bring life let my
[2:45] choices open up a greater way let my
[2:48] choices bring deliverance and healing
[2:50] and all kinds of things let my choices
[2:52] be your choices let my choice be the
[2:55] correct and precise way
[2:57] man oh God help us to stay in the word
[3:01] help us to stay in prayer help us to
[3:03] stay sensitive to the leading of the
[3:05] holy spirit so that we're not flipping
[3:08] about life that we're not bulldozing our
[3:10] way through but we're actually patient
[3:11] and saying God I need to make the right
[3:14] decision I want to know what is your
[3:17] word and your will cause that's my
[3:19] decision is going to be
