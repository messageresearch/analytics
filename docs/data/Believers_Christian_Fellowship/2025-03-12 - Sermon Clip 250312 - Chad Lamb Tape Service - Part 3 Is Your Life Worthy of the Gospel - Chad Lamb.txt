========================================

and I've enjoyed listening to another tape and have another tape service with you it's always a blessing every year I said we're going to do this more than once but you know how it goes we flip months on the calendar like like we flip weeks you know but I thank God that we had this time together and I enjoyed it and if there's anything that this can do the the the purpose behind all of this is to enjoy this together and learn how to dig into the word to to eat from the word not to just listen and read casually but to to take the meat for our day to give us spiritual strength and if I can do anything if God gives me any influence or ability over you all it would be to instill into you a hunger and a desire to read the message for yourselves every child and young person of every age you're only going to be as strong as the amount of good nutritious food you eat and we spend so much time in this world bombarded by other things that we have to partake of and we have to as we mingle with the world there's so many things that are coming in that is not nutritious food that will not give us spiritual strength to fly amen we we've got to gain strength from the word we've got to read the Bibles ourselves we got to read the message ourselves we got to ask God to give us open eyes to see and to hear open our ears and open our eyes that we can feed on the word ourselves so I hope you love the word and I hope you feed on the word daily to have spiritual strength this last leg of the journey is going to require all the vitamins of the whole Bible That's why God took the took the veil off the Bible and gave us the full word because this last leg of the journey to fly clear on out of this Dimension is going to require all the spiritual vitamins that's available that's why we have a four full seven course menu brother bam said for this end time take advantage of it I I encourage you God bless you
