[13:51] here with you and so glad we can be
[13:53] together and very thankful that brother
[13:55] Andreas made it safely in. He had no
[13:58] problems with his flight. So, we thank
[13:59] God for that. And uh we're going to have
[14:01] him here in just a few minutes. But
[14:03] before that, I'd like to start with a
[14:05] baby dedication. Amen. And so, if
[14:08] Brother Adam and Sister Alana Preston
[14:09] would like to bring their little guy up,
[14:11] you guys can make your way up front. So,
[14:13] good to have them back in the service
[14:15] again. They're bringing forward little
[14:18] Andrew [music] James Preston. I looked
[14:21] at his name. This boy has quite a name.
[14:23] Andrew means strong and manly. [music]
[14:26] And James uh we know James is the same
[14:29] name as Jacob. It means suppler, but it
[14:31] means one who can overcome by force or
[14:34] other means. So this boy is going to be
[14:37] a victor. Amen. Amen. [music]
[14:44] Praise God.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Look at his bow tie.
[14:49] Hey there, buddy. Let's all bow our
[14:52] heads together.
[14:54] Dear Lord Jesus, we're so grateful that
[14:56] we [music] can stand, Lord, together,
[14:58] Lord, with this baby in our arms. And we
[15:01] know when you were here on earth, you
[15:03] took the children into your arms and you
[15:04] blessed them, Lord. And God, we want to
[15:07] put a blessing upon little Andrew James.
[15:10] God, that you'd watch over his life,
[15:12] Lord. For he's a gift that you've given
[15:14] to my brother and sister here, Lord,
[15:16] that you have entrusted this life into
[15:18] their hands. [music] And they recognize
[15:20] that by delivering him back to you in a
[15:23] in an act of dedication. Lord, they
[15:25] dedicate not only this life back to you,
[15:27] but they dedicate [music] themselves to
[15:29] nurture and guide this little life.
[15:31] Lord, I pray you bless Adam and you give
[15:33] him wisdom and strength, Lord, to make a
[15:35] living for this child that he might,
[15:38] Lord, provide for his every need, Lord.
[15:40] that he might lead him, Lord, as a
[15:42] shepherd leads sheep. Lord, I pray that
[15:44] you bless Sister Alana, Lord, and she
[15:46] would give the nurture and love and care
[15:48] that little Andrew needs so he could
[15:50] develop into all that you've predestined
[15:51] [music] for him to be. May you shield
[15:54] him and protect him from every fiery
[15:56] dart of the enemy. Lord, may you be his
[15:58] shield. May you be his protector. And
[16:00] may you guide him all the days of his
[16:02] life. And may he grow to know you, Lord,
[16:05] in a personal way through a personal
[16:07] experience while he's young. Lord, may
[16:09] he always walk with you. May he never
[16:11] have to stray away, but may he serve you
[16:13] all the days of his life. And God, help
[16:16] us as a congregation to [music] support
[16:19] this couple and this family. Help us to
[16:22] support them with prayer, with any
[16:24] physical means necessary and our love
[16:26] and our our comfort and our our securing
[16:29] them within our midst. Lord, may we just
[16:31] be a blessing to them as you've
[16:33] entrusted them with this life. [music]
[16:35] And we just want to say thank you, Lord,
[16:37] for it's a privilege, Lord, to hold this
[16:39] little baby. It's a privilege to hand
[16:41] him back to his mother and father and
[16:43] see, God, that [music] you're still
[16:44] using your children. You're still
[16:46] bringing forth life. And you have a plan
[16:47] and a purpose in our lives, and it's
[16:50] being [music] fulfilled in our daily
[16:52] lives. We ask that you would bless them
[16:54] in [music] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you both. Amen. What a
[17:01] good little baby. Amen. God bless you.
[17:05] Oh, praise God.
[17:08] Amen. Well, that is wonderful. Thank you
[17:11] guys. And if that wasn't wonderful
[17:13] enough, I have an announcement to make.
[17:15] There was another baby born Thursday
[17:17] evening. So, if we could bring the the
[17:20] picture up, Brother Donovan, Sister
[17:22] Stephanie Fiser had their little baby
[17:24] boy
[17:27] on Thursday evening. Isaiah Peter Fiser.
[17:31] I mean, if you'll notice, he's 11B.
[17:35] And that's not a typo. I confirmed that
[17:38] that is correct. And so I I thought and
[17:42] 23 in long. And she had him at home. He
[17:44] looks like he might be like 2 months old
[17:46] there, but he was born on Thursday. And
[17:48] so, uh, Sister Stephanie delivered him
[17:52] at home Thursday evening. Everybody's
[17:53] doing really well. Everything went
[17:55] marvelously well. But I think she
[17:57] deserves a trophy or a plaque or some
[17:59] some great recognition. Amen. Did a
[18:02] wonderful job. So, we're so grateful for
[18:04] them and that they're all doing well.
[18:05] May the Lord bless them and and God is
[18:08] just good, friends. I'm just so thankful
[18:10] to dwell in the goodness of God and
[18:12] thank God for his manifold blessings for
[18:14] it's wonderful to be here. Also, I
[18:18] wanted to let you know that I asked
[18:19] Wednesday night for prayer for some
[18:21] brethren in Nigeria. And I had told you
[18:23] that there was um um some bandits there
[18:26] and that they were taken captive. Five
[18:28] brethren along with other people. I got
[18:30] word yesterday from brother Gideon that
[18:33] all five of the captive brethren have
[18:35] been released. So, we want to thank God
[18:37] for that. [applause]
[18:38] Amen.
[18:44] I tell you friends, it's wonderful to
[18:45] serve a living God and we're so grateful
[18:48] for that. So also we've got quite a few
[18:50] visitors here. So we want to make all
[18:52] the visitors feel welcome. Brother Jose
[18:54] Paulac has some friends visiting.

[19:11] his wife Rachel are visiting here from

[19:39] Amen. If we could all stand, we're going
[19:41] to turn the service over to Brother
[19:43] Andreas and allow him to come and share
[19:45] what the Lord's laid on his heart. Amen.
[19:47] Brother Andreas is famous among us as
[19:50] Sister Zabilis, pastor. And I told him
[19:53] it's his that's his claim to fame. But
[19:56] but you know, for years I I was aware of
[19:59] Brother Andreas, we have some mutual
[20:01] friends. I've heard so many good reports
[20:03] and I had such a desire to meet him and
[20:06] he had made an invitation for me to come
[20:07] and I couldn't take it and I had been
[20:09] inviting him and he couldn't make
[20:11] [clears throat] it but eventually God
[20:12] allowed it to work out and I found a
[20:14] wonderful brother and a friend and I
[20:17] have been the benefactor of his
[20:19] friendship and of our times together
[20:21] been quite a blessing to me I mean he
[20:23] was here uh last year and ministered to
[20:25] Wednesday night for us and I was quite
[20:27] blessed with the service as well and so
[20:29] very much looking forward to this
[20:31] morning to see what the Lord will do
[20:32] through our brother and through the gift
[20:34] that he placed within him. And so we
[20:36] want him to find welcome. And you guys
[20:37] know how to do that. Just pull on that
[20:39] word. Just respond. Amen. To God working
[20:41] through the brother and he'll relax and
[20:43] he'll fall right into place and we'll
[20:45] we'll absorb all that God has for us
[20:47] this morning and enjoy it. Amen. So we'd
[20:50] like to invite brother Andreas now with

[23:33] speak to believers. Amen. Amen. So as we
[23:37] uh um I just want to bring the greetings
[23:39] I um the greetings uh I have to bring to
[23:42] you especially from brother Marcus Becca
[23:45] I have I should not forget uh I don't
[23:49] don't call him my in-law but uh our our
[23:51] kids have married so and uh from him and
[23:56] surely his wife and also brother Groalt
[23:58] I want to bring the greetings I think I
[24:00] should really not forget and sister the
[24:03] bill for sure I think uh uh they all
[24:06] sent their greetings and also I I have
[24:09] to bring you I want to and have to bring
[24:11] you greetings from brother from brother
[24:12] from Africa brother Steven Ibal and
[24:15] brother freight Karingi. Uh and last
[24:18] time I was here last year I was here um
[24:22] um you just really uh um u blessed us
[24:26] and also the work over there. And uh as
[24:29] I went back in December, uh we had a we
[24:32] had a very very uh big meeting amongst
[24:36] uh um Pentecostal believers uh many
[24:40] thousands came together and so we could
[24:42] share a little bit about what God has
[24:44] done in our day and uh so um then a
[24:50] thing was born there to uh because those
[24:54] denominational believers they didn't had
[24:56] Bibles. So it was really amazing how
[24:58] that truly developed and what the Lord
[25:00] could do and [clears throat] how the
[25:01] Lord could speak and [snorts] I just
[25:03] want to let you know and thank you from
[25:05] those brothers you are involved in it so
[25:08] and we could manage to get over there
[25:10] 10,000 Bibles middle of this year uh
[25:12] those people received Bibles and it was
[25:15] I think it was so amazing for those
[25:17] believers
[25:19] denominational believers uh not really
[25:21] message believers denominational
[25:22] believers but they never their
[25:24] denomination had no interest in giving
[25:27] them Bibles and you can understand what
[25:29] that is for an impact for them now
[25:32] because now they see uh that the message
[25:34] is not just interested in members
[25:37] &gt;&gt; but is interested in souls.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a great great effect and a
[25:41] great blessing. So thank you very much
[25:43] and this is what I should not forget to
[25:45] let you know. Amen. So greetings from
[25:48] those brothers. Amen. God bless you all.
[25:50] I don't have to introduce myself. You
[25:52] all know me. Uh let's go straight. Thank
[25:54] you musicians. Let's go straight into
[25:55] the word.
[25:56] because I uh uh I have uh something I
[26:00] always am a little bit afraid that I
[26:02] will be too long. So uh we don't want to
[26:05] use too much time in in things that
[26:08] don't need to be done. Uh let's open. I
[26:12] want to speak this morning. Something
[26:13] really um I said to brother Chad
[26:15] something I actually came by with a
[26:18] complete different thought and as I was
[26:20] coming and things developed really the
[26:23] Lord put this on my heart in a in a in a
[26:26] special way and I want to speak this
[26:28] morning on ready for translation.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; I just want to speak on ready for
[26:33] translation. And let's turn our Bibles
[26:35] and go to first Corinthians. Uh 1
[26:38] Corinthians, we want to go and read, we
[26:40] want to read three scriptures. [snorts]
[26:43] Okay. Yes. Thank you. 1 Corinthians, we
[26:47] want to read the sixth chapter. 1
[26:49] Corinthians 6 from 9 to 11. And I
[26:54] [snorts] have to read that just as as
[26:56] really some uh picture in the background
[27:00] that we really also understand of what
[27:01] we speak today this morning. um because
[27:05] it's surely a question what it means to
[27:08] be ready
[27:10] &gt;&gt; and what it really means to be ready and
[27:13] I and we understand that uh we are here
[27:16] and uh there is a necessarity to be
[27:19] ready for translation.
[27:21] Amen. So let's let's uh chapter 6 uh 1
[27:25] Corinthians 69-11.
[27:27] [snorts]
[27:28] Know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[27:30] not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not
[27:32] deceived, neither fornicators, nor
[27:34] idolattors, nor adulterers, nor
[27:37] effeminate, nor abusers of themsel with
[27:40] mankind, nor thieves, nor covetousness,
[27:42] nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[27:45] extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom
[27:48] of God. And such were some of you, but
[27:51] ye are washed, but yet are sanctified,
[27:55] but yet are justified in the name of the
[27:59] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. How wonderful the scripture turns
[28:06] here. Keep that really in mind. Ye are
[28:09] washed. Ye are sanctified, but ye are
[28:12] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:15] and by the spirit of our God. Amen.
[28:19] Let's turn then to Luke 18. Luke 18. I
[28:23] want to read another very uh well-known
[28:26] [snorts] scripture. Luke 18, we want to
[28:30] read 9-14.
[28:36] [clears throat]
[28:39] Luke 18 9-14.
[28:43] And he spake this parable unto certain
[28:47] which trusted in themsel
[28:50] that they were righteous and despised
[28:54] others.
[28:57] Two men went up in the temple to pray,
[28:59] the one a Pharisee and the other a
[29:02] publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed
[29:04] thus with himself. God, I thank thee
[29:07] that I'm not, as the other men are,
[29:10] extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
[29:13] even at this publican. I fast twice in
[29:16] the week. I give tithe of all that I
[29:19] possess. And the publican stand a would
[29:22] not lift up so much as his eyes unto
[29:25] heaven, but smokeote upon his breast,
[29:27] saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
[29:32] I tell you, this man went down to his
[29:34] house justified
[29:36] rather than the other. For everyone that
[29:39] exaltth himself shall be abased, but he
[29:42] that humbles himself shall be exalted.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; That man went home justified.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; And one more scripture, James 5:16-18.
[29:55] I think you know me. I I just like to
[29:56] read the scriptures all in the
[29:58] beginning. And because I know you are
[30:00] very uh flexible and well trained well
[30:03] well uh yeah well trained so you will
[30:06] you will see how it fits during the
[30:09] service.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. James 5 I want to read 16 to 18.
[30:18] Confess your faults one to to another
[30:21] and pray one for another that ye may be
[30:25] healed. The effectual fever prayer of a
[30:29] righteous man availth much. And we have
[30:33] just heard that this man went home
[30:36] righteous.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; So the the fever prayer of a righteous
[30:42] man availth much. And now watch very
[30:44] very carefully how beautiful here
[30:47] something is put in. Elias was a man
[30:50] subject to like passions as we are. And
[30:54] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[30:56] rain. And it rained not on the earth by
[30:59] the space of three years and six months.
[31:02] And he prayed again and the heaven gave
[31:04] rain and the earth brought forth her
[31:07] fruit. Amen. Isn't that amazing? As the
[31:11] Bible speaks of a a a man, a righteous
[31:16] man, then it turns to Elias and tells us
[31:21] that he was a man like passion.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's pray. [snorts]
[31:26] Heavenly Father, you're so wonderful and
[31:29] you're so great. Lord, your work is
[31:32] marvelous. And we just want to come to
[31:35] you this morning with a heart of
[31:37] thanksgiving. And Father, with an honor
[31:41] unto you, because you are the only one
[31:44] that should receive honor and glory,
[31:47] Father, and everything that we do this
[31:48] morning, this service as we speak, may
[31:51] you anoint your word. May you anoint the
[31:53] one that is speaking and the ones that
[31:55] are listening, Father, that we are all
[31:58] involved, that you can pull us into what
[32:00] you are doing amongst us, Father. And uh
[32:04] and just prepare us for the days to
[32:06] come. We ask it, Father, all to your
[32:08] honor and to your glory in Jesus
[32:10] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[32:13] as you enjoy [snorts] your seats. Amen.
[32:16] So we uh we uh just actually want to I
[32:20] want to start with a statement of the
[32:23] prophet actually um that he that he made
[32:27] also uh concerning the time that we are
[32:30] living in and and then we want to um we
[32:33] want to really do a little journey this
[32:35] morning uh a little journey in what God
[32:38] is doing, how far we are already. uh you
[32:41] know um we see uh we see uh modern
[32:44] events that was years ago made clear by
[32:47] prophecy but those modern events are not
[32:50] only made clear by prophecy but now they
[32:52] are made clear as they are happening
[32:55] &gt;&gt; and uh and so we are and and we
[32:58] understand there's not many things that
[33:01] maybe has to happen and will happen um
[33:04] as we even brother random re speaking
[33:06] years ago already [snorts] so and uh we
[33:09] are just standing ing there. We are just
[33:12] standing here and uh the last I think
[33:14] the great thing the last thing according
[33:16] to Romans will be the change of our
[33:18] bodies. Is it right? That we are facing.
[33:21] So and we want to really to see um uh uh
[33:24] what it means to be ready for that. What
[33:27] it really means to be ready and I think
[33:30] this is surely a question uh that comes
[33:32] up. Are we ready? Uh how are we ready?
[33:36] You know what means readiness? what
[33:38] means really readiness and uh and and as
[33:42] we go along this is really the thought
[33:43] behind it. Brother Venom would say in
[33:45] the message uh uh Balamin Gilead 19 in
[33:49] the 50s he says he just uh is you're
[33:52] just that way as it is just simple as
[33:54] you are going home uh I'm going out and
[33:57] start the car that's all an act of faith
[34:01] &gt;&gt; right
[34:02] tomorrow I will meet you in a certain
[34:05] place that's all an act of faith because
[34:07] you have just done it so much because
[34:11] it's a regular routine with you.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that's the way the things of
[34:18] God are.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; After you have trusted him and waited
[34:23] him and so many and seen him so many
[34:25] things, it becomes like a regular
[34:28] routine.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; And this is the condition I think the
[34:34] church will be in just before the coming
[34:38] of the Lord.
[34:41] So the rapture will just go on right
[34:44] that way. It will be a regular routine
[34:49] &gt;&gt; of following the scriptures and the
[34:52] plans of God.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you understand. So it's it's I
[34:56] think u um as the prophet would would
[34:59] just just bring it. It will be it it's
[35:02] just a regular routine because you have
[35:04] done it so many times
[35:07] &gt;&gt; it just becomes something. And then
[35:08] brother Renham further said uh in in in
[35:12] the message and knoweth it not and he
[35:15] said let think uh of the loudysene
[35:18] church age and its condition today. As
[35:21] far as I know I don't see see anything
[35:24] to hinder at this time the coming of the
[35:27] Lord Jesus outside of the readiness of
[35:30] his church.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so and we all understand when
[35:35] we speak of the coming of the Lord that
[35:37] includes the change of the body.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the coming of the Lord um and
[35:43] we understand in this time uh is is uh
[35:46] is is something that is still mysterious
[35:49] because we we all understand that it
[35:52] will be a secret coming. Is that right?
[35:54] It will be just a secret coming. And uh
[35:56] Jesus would say the world will not see
[35:58] me but you shall see me because I will
[36:01] be with you and I will be in you.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So so uh as we are as we are
[36:07] seeing that speaking of readiness and
[36:10] brother Adam said at that time already
[36:12] he said I can see nothing what hinders
[36:15] the coming of the Lord. And I really uh
[36:18] uh want to want to put that down. The
[36:20] coming of the Lord as it is a process.
[36:22] It did come to its finalization as
[36:25] Romans 8 would let us know which is the
[36:28] final step of the do adoption, the
[36:31] change of our bodies.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; And we understand all that we are very
[36:35] far advanced in the rapture already.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are very far advanced. What was
[36:42] once started is not just starting
[36:44] anymore,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; but it's far advanced. And I believe we
[36:48] are just standing at the brink of just
[36:51] one thing is missing and that is the
[36:52] body change.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I believe we are we are
[36:57] even much further than the prophet would
[37:00] look at at this at his time where he was
[37:02] standing in 1965.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are we are we are much further
[37:07] than that. And we will see that maybe
[37:09] this mo this this morning a little bit
[37:10] how far we are. And then surely the
[37:12] question always will rise are we ready
[37:15] for the change?
[37:17] what it means to be ready for the change
[37:19] &gt;&gt; with all the circumstances that are.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it it really it really um
[37:27] because as I would say as the prophet
[37:30] left the scene with the church with the
[37:32] believers, the situation became actually
[37:36] not more easy and not not more simple,
[37:38] but situations became more complicated
[37:40] and more tensed. Is it right? As the
[37:43] Bible would let us know, when the enemy
[37:45] comes in like a flood,
[37:48] &gt;&gt; God then said God would raise up a
[37:50] standard against it. And brother Mam is
[37:52] asking the people, are you the standard?
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you the standard?
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the standard being raised, are
[38:01] you the standard? So and we see how the
[38:03] enemy comes in like in fact brother Adam
[38:05] I think 50 60 years ago look how he was
[38:09] looking at things and situation. He
[38:11] found it terrible. He found it
[38:12] difficult. But what about today?
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. What about today?
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are closer to the body
[38:19] change than ever.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; So there must be a readiness.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Right. There must be a readiness.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; And I know that's the question. Are we
[38:27] ready for the body change?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; What mean? What does it mean to be
[38:31] ready?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; You know when I am ready?
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I'm ready because I believe
[38:37] the bride will go home in great victory.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. the bride will go home in great
[38:42] victory. When the prophet left the
[38:44] scene, Christ remained behind. [snorts]
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are fellowshipping
[38:50] today, not so much with the prophet
[38:52] anymore himself, but with Christ
[38:55] himself.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what we really want to
[38:58] look uh uh very close this morning. And
[39:02] as we have read the story of Luke 19, I
[39:05] I I thought this this this makes it and
[39:08] and because that man, it's it's very
[39:10] interesting that man, what did he do to
[39:14] to to get justified to his home?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he went home
[39:20] justified.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[39:23] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a wonderful situation,
[39:26] you understand? Not only forgiven, but
[39:29] justified. Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; You know, you understand when the
[39:32] prophet would speak of this hour, he
[39:34] said, "No, the true bride, the the the
[39:37] church of the living God is not only
[39:39] forgiven."
[39:40] &gt;&gt; She stands justified.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what and I trust because we
[39:46] have to stand justified because now we
[39:49] are married.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. because of marriage something
[39:59] happens.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; So that man here it's it's it's very
[40:07] important. Look look look uh and I I
[40:10] think it shows it shows very very clear
[40:14] how important
[40:17] for readiness and for to be ready is the
[40:21] right kind of attitude.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; God.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] let me let me really
[40:29] linger a little on that because um and
[40:34] right kind of attitude
[40:36] as brother Renham would say according to
[40:40] every promise that God has made.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Is the rapture is the change of the body
[40:50] a promise?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; It's a promise. Is that right?
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[40:56] &gt;&gt; So, and brother Brennan would say, allow
[40:58] me allow me quickly. I think it's it's a
[41:00] beautiful uh uh statement that he that
[41:04] he made in one of the one of the
[41:06] sermons. Um I think awakening
[41:09] uh awakening Jesus. I think he said
[41:12] that. Brother Wam said awakening Jesus.
[41:15] And that's also very good to know. Um it
[41:17] is not really your mental attitude that
[41:21] does it. Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; So it's it's not really let let's let's
[41:29] really see how the prophet is really
[41:31] declaring it nicely. And brother Ranom
[41:35] would say he said you see the mental
[41:38] attitude you take towards now the mind
[41:42] won't do it.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you give that attitude
[41:47] towards something not that has life in
[41:50] it, then that life comes down and does
[41:53] it.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; So your right mental attitude towards
[41:59] him. [clears throat]
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And then he will do it.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; So So and it's it's actually very
[42:08] simple. We understand and I could see
[42:10] that this this man and it becomes very
[42:12] obvious in the Bible. H also why brother
[42:15] Renham would say the word is in the
[42:18] bride as it was in Mary.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; And as we go to Mary a little bit a
[42:25] little bit later um he the prophet would
[42:28] say that as the Holy Spirit would have
[42:32] told him pick up the pen and write.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; There actually it comes out that the
[42:38] word is in the bride as it was in Mary.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He could have chosen any other
[42:43] type. There's any wonderful types in the
[42:46] Bible of women. I mean Sarah would be a
[42:48] brilliant type.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; But the word is in the bride, not as it
[42:52] was in Sarah.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Brana is very specific. He takes Mary.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Because Mary shows something that made
[43:01] her ready.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. To make her ready
[43:06] &gt;&gt; to be a part of the coming of the Lord.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And I think that's as brother Brennon
[43:16] would say, he said, he said, you
[43:17] understand? So it's not your mental
[43:20] attitude. It's not your mind that does
[43:22] it.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; But if you have a right kind of mental
[43:26] attitude to the one that has life,
[43:30] &gt;&gt; then he will bring it to pass.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; So it's not, you understand, it's not
[43:35] your mind that does it. It's not your
[43:38] strong mind that does does it.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; So it's not mind over matter,
[43:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:44] &gt;&gt; But it's actually your right kind of
[43:46] mental attitude.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; And that's how simple it is.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's how simple it is.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; SO THAT PUBLICAN JUST SAID, "LORD, have
[43:55] mercy on me."
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; That that was all. and he went home
[44:05] justified.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we I think really let let me
[44:12] ponder a little bit on that because uh
[44:14] uh we will uh we really see how
[44:16] important and how simple and how how
[44:19] easy it is to be ready.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Is the rapture is the change of the body
[44:29] a promise?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a promise.
[44:34] So just maintain the right kind of
[44:36] mental attitude towards any promise
[44:39] &gt;&gt; then he will bring it to pass.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we understand as we see a
[44:48] few uh uh sisters of the Bible we see
[44:51] and there we can see how attitude is
[44:54] actually very and why brother Brandham
[44:56] would really point out that the word and
[44:58] and don't forget it was in that time
[45:02] when the Holy Spirit told him pick up
[45:04] your pen and write.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; That was a special time church.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; That was a special time. We come maybe a
[45:11] little later to that just to see that
[45:14] that it is really something that is a
[45:16] message going forth.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; To the church.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To the church. So they understand
[45:23] who they are.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; And what is happening in them or with
[45:27] them
[45:28] &gt;&gt; and just they're okay. You know what
[45:30] Mary did?
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, we we we come a little later. We we
[45:34] don't want to run ahead of it. You know
[45:36] in the we have in the Bible we have the
[45:38] woman called Eve
[45:40] &gt;&gt; and it is evident that Eve was the right
[45:44] kind of womb and she received the wrong
[45:47] kind of seed.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; And the result was Cain.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that you are the right
[45:55] kind of womb?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Be very careful what you receive as a
[46:00] seed.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Because this is what you will bring
[46:02] forth.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The woman brought forth Cain and
[46:06] brought forth Abel.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why Satan IS FIGHTING SO
[46:11] HARD TO GET YOU.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; YES.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNOWS you are his only
[46:15] chance.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD KNOWS THAT YOU ARE HIS
[46:19] ONLY CHANCE.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the woman was the right
[46:24] womb, but she Eve, she was the right
[46:27] womb and she received the wrong seed.
[46:29] The result was Cain.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Then we have another woman. in the
[46:33] Bible. Her name is Hagar. She was the
[46:35] wrong womb
[46:37] &gt;&gt; and the right seat.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; There was a wrong womb and the right
[46:43] seat and the result was Ishmael.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; And then we have another woman. This is
[46:50] Sarah. This is amazing. She had a right
[46:54] womb
[46:58] and received the right seat.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what came forth was a man that
[47:06] could die.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; But then we have Mary.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; She was the right womb
[47:20] &gt;&gt; and surely she received the right seat.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; But that's not the end of the story.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Watch the attitude Sarah had. Yeah.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Watch the attitude Sarah had.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And watch the attitude Mary had.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; So it was actually the attitude of Mary.
[47:40] Do you know what attitude it was TOWARDS
[47:42] ANY PROMISE OF GOD?
[47:45] That's right.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; That's why she said to the angel and I
[47:48] trust we can say today to the sec to to
[47:51] to an angel not the same but to an angel
[47:55] that will give us that brought us a
[47:57] message it be to me according to your
[47:59] word.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; THAT ATTITUDE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT that
[48:03] right KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT he had that
[48:06] she had
[48:08] &gt;&gt; towards the promise
[48:10] &gt;&gt; then he brought it to pass. Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; She never created the egg. She never
[48:15] CREATED THE SEED.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; GOD DID.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[48:20] &gt;&gt; SO YOU WILL NOT CHANGE YOUR BODY. GOD
[48:22] will do.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; We is it's so important that and I think
[48:31] this is something that will stay with
[48:32] us. So I would tell to be to be really
[48:35] ready for the change is to have the
[48:37] right kind of attitude
[48:39] &gt;&gt; towards any promise of God.
[48:42] Amen.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And if you if you read the message, read
[48:44] the Bible, you find what kind of things
[48:47] God HAS PROMISED. AND HOW MANY TIME how
[48:50] many time we develop a negative attitude
[48:54] &gt;&gt; towards God has promised
[48:57] &gt;&gt; because we think we are just a human
[48:59] being
[49:03] &gt;&gt; right.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And you know as Mary as Sarah would say
[49:07] me an old woman,
[49:10] &gt;&gt; right? Right.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; We an 2,000y old church.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we take the attitude we are
[49:27] just sinners saved by grace.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; When you are a sinner saved by grace,
[49:34] you are no sinner anymore.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Is that correct? Yes. But come on. When
[49:41] you are, do you believe you are saved?
[49:44] &gt;&gt; So when YOU ARE A SINNER SAVED BY GRACE,
[49:47] &gt;&gt; you're W. Here we go. YOU ARE NOT A
[49:49] SINNER saved by God's mercy.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; You're a sinner saved by grace.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; GRACE GOES BACK TO PREDESTINATION. God
[49:59] saved you because he had a plan with
[50:01] you.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; That's why the capstone I'm running
[50:05] ahead of myself a little. Trust me, can
[50:07] get get that back, you know. THAT'S WHY
[50:09] THE CAPSTONE WOULD come down
[50:12] &gt;&gt; under the shouting GRACE GRACE WITH US.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; SO THERE WOULD BE A PEOPLE ON EARTH AS
[50:18] THE CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN THAT WOULD
[50:21] SHOUT GRACE GRACE WITH US. THEY WOULD
[50:23] NOT CALL MERCY mercy
[50:27] &gt;&gt; because PAUL WOULD SAY PAUL would say I
[50:30] AM WHAT I am
[50:34] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God.
[50:38] You know what uh you know it's allow me
[50:40] to bring that quickly in. You know what
[50:42] grace actually is?
[50:44] Grace is an act of receiving
[50:48] unmmerited favor.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And allow me to say favor is never fair.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; God's favor is not fair.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Because he's favoring you.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; So grace, grace is an act of receiving
[51:14] unmmerited unmmerited favor. And this
[51:17] happened in our day. You understand? We
[51:19] have to understand that we are what we
[51:22] are by the grace of God.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know that the whole
[51:26] Bible allow me to for a few minutes to
[51:28] go there because because I think this is
[51:31] so important as we as we speak of
[51:34] attitude. Hallelujah. As we speak of
[51:36] attitude that we understand all that is
[51:39] happening. All that we are all that will
[51:41] be the rapture the change of THE BODY IS
[51:43] JUST AN ACT OF GOD'S GRACE.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; When God saved YOU HE NEVER FELT SORRY
[51:50] for you. That's right. God,
[51:54] &gt;&gt; he never felt pity for you.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Grace is not pity.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yet, HE IS STILL A God rich in
[52:05] mercy.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; But mercy is an act of of taking away
[52:13] deserved punishment.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; That's mercy.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Benham would say, he
[52:19] would say grace is as old as the earth
[52:23] is not mercy
[52:26] &gt;&gt; because grace goes back to the
[52:29] beginning.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go. Grace, brother Ben said
[52:32] when when love is projected,
[52:36] &gt;&gt; GRACE COMES FORTH
[52:38] &gt;&gt; AND CAUSES the result.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why when brother
[52:43] Venom you understand in the garden of
[52:44] Eden as we really see uh uh uh the and
[52:48] the lamb was lain before the foundation
[52:50] of the world. Amen. The lamb was lain
[52:52] before the foundation of the world. When
[52:55] there before the foundation of the world
[52:57] THERE WERE NO SPACE for hell.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Hell was created for the
[53:06] devil and his angels.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Right. BUT YOU KNOW, YOU UNDERSTAND that
[53:10] when the lamb was lame from before the
[53:13] foundation of the world, it was not
[53:17] because God felt pity that we ARE ON OUR
[53:20] WAY to hell.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Because hell was not there before the
[53:25] foundation of the world.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; I hope I trust trust we get that. Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE
[53:31] FOUNDATION of the world, IT WAS JUST
[53:34] SLAIN BECAUSE GOD'S GRACE.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAD A PLAN. THAT'S WHY WHEN
[53:39] ADAM AND EVE WAS IN THE GARDEN of Eden
[53:41] and they had fallen, HE CAME AROUND THE
[53:43] CORNER WITH a bloody skin.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER FELT PITY FOR ADAM AND HIS
[53:50] WIFE.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS NOT AFRAID THAT THEY WERE GOING
[53:53] TO HELL.
[53:56] That's right.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; So all the the blood ALL THE BLOOD SHED
[54:00] WAS ACTUALLY AN ACT OF GRACE.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT BLOOD WAS SHED, the skin
[54:06] WAS DONE SO THAT THEY WOULD MAKE TO MAKE
[54:08] SURE THAT they would come back.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand that? BECAUSE IT'S
[54:18] SO IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT we that we uh
[54:21] that we take and keep the right kind of
[54:23] attitude.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] You must have the right
[54:27] kind of attitude towards any promise. So
[54:30] if you if it comes to the BODY CHANGE,
[54:32] NEVER TRUST IN YOUR MERIT.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[54:38] &gt;&gt; you understand that?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; So because the the the CHANGE OF THE
[54:42] BODY IS AN ACT OF GOD'S GRACE. YEAH.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts]
[54:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; SO, so mercy or a grace is an act of
[54:53] receiving unmmerited favor.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; My that's why when the capstone comes
[55:01] down, he comes down under the shouting
[55:04] grace grace WITH US.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; THAT attitude is there amongst the
[55:09] church that received the capstone. Don't
[55:12] you believe that this is the time that
[55:14] we're living in?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Because head and body are united
[55:22] &gt;&gt; or are uniting.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; This is a uniting time in sign.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you understand and and even
[55:31] Jesus, my goodness, even Jesus himself,
[55:33] the Bible said he grew in grace and
[55:38] truth. AMEN.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WEAPON TO OVERCOME
[55:43] &gt;&gt; WAS THAT HE UNDERSTOOD I AM WHAT I AM BY
[55:46] THE GRACE OF GOD.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[55:53] Church church it's just that we keep the
[55:55] right attitude.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Because for me this is one of
[55:58] the only things that keep that that that
[56:01] we that we are here for and and and that
[56:04] is that is remaining to find readiness
[56:07] is just having the right kind of
[56:09] attitude.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; God
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I I think we can say praise the Lord
[56:14] RIGHT
[56:15] &gt;&gt; SO IF SOMEBODY is really rapture ready
[56:18] or ready for the change for sure he will
[56:21] have the right kind of attitude.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:28] [clears throat]
[56:29] Amen.
[56:30] [snorts]
[56:32] Now, let's go to first Thessalonians
[56:36] just a little bit to uh to go
[56:40] and to see where we are at, you know,
[56:42] what what all has happened or what is
[56:46] all happening. Then we really also
[56:48] understand how far we are.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[56:59] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians,
[57:02] we we all know that scripture is very
[57:04] but but let me let me little bit expound
[57:07] on that and ju just keep in mind we will
[57:11] go later back to a few types of the
[57:14] Bible. Elijah will be one of them.
[57:18] And we want to really see of of
[57:21] characters in the Bible that were
[57:23] rapture ready.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Ready for translation.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we might have our own
[57:30] thoughts. You know how many times I can
[57:33] see that people have their own thoughts
[57:34] what it means to be ready?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. When I reach this point,
[57:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN I REACH THIS POINT ON that letter
[57:42] to a statue of a perfect man,
[57:45] when I have added all the things. Okay,
[57:48] then
[57:50] &gt;&gt; how many years we have tried it?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; You know what I find out many many uh
[57:58] get me right now when we getting older
[58:01] that's myself also you know many times
[58:04] we don't become more spiritual
[58:07] &gt;&gt; we forget more.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; So I never trust in what I know.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I might lose that.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we as we as we go here, we we
[58:31] UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THE attitude
[58:33] is.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; And and and will be, you understand? And
[58:36] and and brother Venom was so plain. We
[58:38] understand how how the attitude was
[58:40] really the difference between Mary and
[58:42] Sarah.
[58:44] SO SARAH developed a neg you know why
[58:46] she developed a negative attitude
[58:48] because of the circumstances
[58:51] &gt;&gt; that's true
[58:51] &gt;&gt; right
[58:52] &gt;&gt; and what kind of what kind of attitude
[58:54] do we have have we developed
[58:56] &gt;&gt; because of all the circumstances
[58:58] &gt;&gt; is that RIGHT THAT'S WHY SHE SAID YEAH
[59:01] COME ON DON'T MAKE A JOKE WITH ME I'M an
[59:02] old lady I and my husband having
[59:05] pleasure
[59:06] &gt;&gt; right
[59:10] [snorts]
[59:12] because
[59:13] of the age that she was living in.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Now she was not in Sodom.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Like we are not in Laia.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; But we rub shoulders
[59:28] &gt;&gt; with Sodom and with Ludicia.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF Z THAT Sarah developed a
[59:34] negative attitude.
[59:37] And we must be very careful that this
[59:39] Satan's Eden is not implementing on us a
[59:43] certain picture what it means to be
[59:45] ready.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; What it means to be ready.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Allow us really to UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
[59:53] BIBLE said what it needs to be ready.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right? WHAT THE PROPHET TELLS us
[59:58] what it needs to be ready. The brother
[1:00:00] Brandon would say your attitude actually
[1:00:03] presents you before God.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hey, is it isn't that isn't that
[1:00:10] amazing?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; So, not what I achieve.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Presents me before God.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; But my attitude.
[1:00:20] Is it not the prophet that said he said
[1:00:23] it is not so important what you really
[1:00:27] or for God it is important what you want
[1:00:30] to do.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Not what you finally achieve.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And Sarah Sarah she developed a negative
[1:00:42] attitude because of the of the loudian
[1:00:45] condition that she was sodom condition
[1:00:47] that she was living in. Again I want to
[1:00:48] say she was not in Sodom.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Like we are not in Lodicia but we rub
[1:00:54] shoulders with Lisia.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We rub she rubbed shoulders with with
[1:00:58] with Sodom. And so she developed because
[1:01:01] of circumstances because of symptoms
[1:01:04] BECAUSE OF AGE BECAUSE OF INABILITY.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Never develop a negative attitude
[1:01:15] because of your inability.
[1:01:19] Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS NOT LOOKING WHAT YOU ARE
[1:01:24] ABLE OF TO DO. GOD IS looking for what
[1:01:26] you want.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT attitude
[1:01:30] is.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And we will find that a little later
[1:01:32] really in the Bible. Now let's let's
[1:01:34] read uh e really actually that we see
[1:01:36] where we are at you know and and and and
[1:01:40] trustfully um we can say the prophet
[1:01:43] would say the only thing that I can see
[1:01:45] is still missing is the readiness of the
[1:01:47] church.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And I must be honest with you
[1:01:57] for me
[1:01:59] the bride is ready.
[1:02:05] Otherwise,
[1:02:07] what must happen to make us ready?
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; What do we expect?
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; What do we expect that helps us to be
[1:02:16] ready?
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; What kind of precious squeeze we think
[1:02:19] must come?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet said squeeze will bring you
[1:02:24] nothing.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; That's what he also said.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:02:31] So what do we expect that helps us to
[1:02:34] make us ready?
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; I believe if you are sitting here with
[1:02:43] the right kind of attitude,
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; towards the promise of God,
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; you are ready.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS of your circumstances,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; regardless of your ability,
[1:03:02] Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Church, it's it's very simple.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Why would we WHY WOULD WE TRY TO DO THE
[1:03:12] MAGIC?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; When it's so simple.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID WHAT DID MARY DO MAGIC?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; To that the life that she became
[1:03:25] actually the life house of God. Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID YOU SHE JUST said
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; TO THE MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; AND SHE REMEMBER DON'T FORGET HOW THAT
[1:03:38] message started.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; The angel CAME DOWN AND BEFORE HE TOLD
[1:03:43] her
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; the message he said MARY I WANT YOU TO
[1:03:47] understand what is happening to you now.
[1:03:50] It's God's grace. AMEN.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; DID THE ANGEL NOT SAY
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE YOU ARE HIGHLY FAVORED AMONGST
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; HIGHLY FAVORED MEANS YOU FOUND GRACE.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY AGAIN NOT MERCY BUT GRACE
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GRACE GOES BACK TO
[1:04:08] PREDESTINATION.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAVED YOU, I'M SAVED BY GRACE.
[1:04:13] NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY FOR ME.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE LOVED ME. IS THAT
[1:04:19] RIGHT?
[1:04:20] HE SAVED ME BECAUSE HE HAD A PURPOSE FOR
[1:04:23] ME.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let me say that again.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And I trust we can understand that
[1:04:32] proper because I think sometimes it's so
[1:04:35] important that that we that we really
[1:04:38] understand what happened in our day.
[1:04:39] That's why brother Adam called it it's
[1:04:41] the message of grace.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; He never said it's a message of mercy.
[1:04:48] Yeah.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Is a message of God's grace.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is it right? BECAUSE REMEMBER IN
[1:04:54] THE GARDEN of Eden when the lamb was
[1:04:56] shed, it was shed for Adam and God was
[1:04:59] clothing him with that lamb skinin.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE GOD FELT PITY THAT ADAM WAS
[1:05:04] ON HIS WAY to hell.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HELL IS NOT CREATED FOR ADAM AND
[1:05:09] HIS RACE.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; HELL IS CREATED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS
[1:05:16] ANGELS. AMEN.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? SO WHEN GOD SAVED
[1:05:20] YOU AND YOU CAN SAY I'M SAVED BY GRACE,
[1:05:22] THEN YOU ARE NOT SAY THAT'S WHY WHEN GOD
[1:05:24] IS NOT FEELING PITY for us,
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; we should not feel pity for ourselves.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And Sarah FELT PITY FOR HERSELF. POOR
[1:05:36] ME.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THAT POOR ME, SHE
[1:05:40] DEVELOPED a negative attitude.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen church. It will be very simple to
[1:05:47] be changed.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; It will be as the prophet would say. I
[1:05:50] believe it will be just a daily routine.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I'M NOT WAITING
[1:05:57] FOR THE CHANGE. I am the change. THE
[1:05:59] RAPTURE IS NOT COMING TO ME. I'M A PART
[1:06:01] OF IT.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Just keep regardless of the
[1:06:09] circumstances, regardless of the stuff.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:15] YOU KNOW WHY GOD ALLOWS this stuff? Why
[1:06:18] he allows the stuff around us in
[1:06:20] circumstances? JUST TO PROVE YES. Come
[1:06:22] on, CHURCH. JUST TO PROVE TO SATAN THAT
[1:06:25] THIS BRIDE IS DIFFERENT.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; SO IT NEEDED WHOLE HELL
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; to prove who you are.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let let's read. For the Bible
[1:06:44] said, we we we we want to really look at
[1:06:47] this. For the for the Lord himself,
[1:06:48] first Thessalonians 4:16, for the Lord
[1:06:52] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:06:54] shout and with the voice of the
[1:06:55] archangel, and with a trump of God, and
[1:06:57] the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:07:04] be caught up together with them in the
[1:07:06] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[1:07:09] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:07:11] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:07:13] words.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; So we understand what so so certain
[1:07:18] things has to happen for the dead in
[1:07:20] Christ to rise. We understand this is
[1:07:23] actually something that is can I say in
[1:07:26] process.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; But the dead in Christ will rise.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; You know why THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL
[1:07:33] RISE? because they will hear the voice
[1:07:35] of the resurrection
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUMP OF GOD SHALL SOUND.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; AND I JUST WANT YOU and and and AS WE GO
[1:07:42] ON AND I TRUST YOU KEEP THE right kind
[1:07:44] of attitude.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and not not uh not LOOK TOO
[1:07:51] MUCH ABOUT THE circumstances that you
[1:07:54] are in and that you are around because
[1:07:56] the circumstances that God [laughter]
[1:07:59] that God allowed in your life IS ONLY
[1:08:02] THAT YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU ARE
[1:08:05] DIFFERENT.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; SO HOW IS GOD PROVING THAT THIS Eve is
[1:08:15] different than the other one?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. stuff
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; circumstances.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; She's not putting a He's not putting a
[1:08:24] crown on her and said, "No, this is my
[1:08:26] bride. She's better than the first one."
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; HE IS ALLOWING THE GREATEST TEMPTATION
[1:08:32] TO COME TO YOU
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WANT TO PROVE HIS, YOU
[1:08:37] UNDERSTAND, I mean [laughter]
[1:08:40] his his accountant or how you call it is
[1:08:43] on stake.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because he made the statement.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; He made the statement.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; That this bride
[1:08:54] is different than the first one.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; You know that it was God's statement.
[1:09:02] It was not so much
[1:09:04] Yope speaking of himself.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. AMEN.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ACTUALLY God
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; telling to Satan
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; that there's someone on earth that is
[1:09:13] perfect.
[1:09:17] Is that right?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD IS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:09:21] YOU, HE IS RESPONSIBLE.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That it happens.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And Job was here on earth. HE DIDN'T
[1:09:31] KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THAT OH, CHURCH. YES.
[1:09:38] We see the whole story of Job
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; and and and the whole story of Job. All
[1:09:44] of his settings
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; starts with him being perfect.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Did you ever thought of it?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Go to Job one.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; There the Bible said little later in Job
[1:10:02] I think 18 God repeats it to Satan.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said, "Hey, have you
[1:10:07] looked to my servant Job?" Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; So the whole story of Job and I want you
[1:10:12] really to and and and we have the
[1:10:15] prophet for that.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; The whole Jo story of Job starts when he
[1:10:20] is perfect.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Not flawless.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Not without mistakes.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; No. I mean THIS IS THE GUY GOD SAID HE'S
[1:10:33] PERFECT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?
[1:10:35] CURSED BE THE DAY THAT I was born.
[1:10:37] That's right.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; SO, HE HAD HIS BAD DAYS. IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID ALREADY HE'S PERFECT.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; And God cannot change his mind about his
[1:10:49] word.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You You understand that? SO THAT SHOWS
[1:10:56] EXACTLY REGARDLESS OF WHAT STUFF,
[1:10:58] REGARDLESS SOMETIMES HOW YOU HOW YOUR
[1:11:01] EMOTIONS BETRAY YOU.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; You're still ready.
[1:11:11] Can we say praise THE LORD?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; SO JUST KEEP THE RIGHT attitude
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; towards what God is saying about you.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Or well, it's easy for me when when I
[1:11:26] can believe that I'm a sinner saved by
[1:11:28] grace.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; But what about when God tells you, "I
[1:11:33] saved you for a purpose.
[1:11:36] How is our attitude then?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Sarah developed a negative attitude.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Such a negative attitude. When Elohim
[1:11:45] came to her, Abraham came to her or
[1:11:48] Elohim came to her in this second visit.
[1:11:50] She had developed such a negative
[1:11:52] attitude because of all the
[1:11:53] circumstances, all this stuff. AND YET
[1:11:56] GOD ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN TO PROVE THAT
[1:11:58] HE'S still God.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and and and Charlie
[1:12:05] before before we go on remember when e
[1:12:08] all the things when it comes to job it's
[1:12:10] the oldest book in the Bible
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; is that right
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; amen it's the oldest book in the Bible
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; and the whole story of Job starts
[1:12:21] with him being perfect
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; so all the things that happened to Yope
[1:12:31] come on
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; are we are Are you awake?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Not one of the things
[1:12:40] that happened to Job was to chastise him
[1:12:45] [snorts]
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; only to prove him."
[1:12:51] [snorts]
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you understand? So nothing
[1:12:55] really that happened to you. Brother,
[1:12:56] you have a quote for it, brother. I'm
[1:12:58] said that.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; You know why? BECAUSE GOD DIDN'T NEED TO
[1:13:01] CHASTISE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS PERFECT.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; By the way, when we come TO
[1:13:07] CHASTISEMENT, THE BIBLE PAUL WOULD SAY
[1:13:09] it's only for a few days.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Like in our earthly home, WE JUST
[1:13:15] CHASTISE our children only for a few
[1:13:17] days. My son is now 30 years old. Don't
[1:13:19] ask me to chastise him now.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SO CHASTISEMENT ANYHOW IS ONLY
[1:13:28] OF A few days.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And in the in the in the time of come on
[1:13:33] in the time OF JOB NOTHING THAT HAPPENS
[1:13:35] TO JOB HERE TO HERE WE ARE STANDING
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE DECLARED BY THE MESSAGE OF
[1:13:40] THE HOUR PERFECT.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You know why? BECAUSE AN PERFECT GOD
[1:13:47] will not marry an imperfect woman.
[1:13:52] AND THE FACT THAT HE'S ASKING YOU TO
[1:13:56] MARRY HIM SHOWS WHO YOU ARE in his
[1:13:59] sight.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; What attitude do we have
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; towards that?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; What attitude do we have
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; towards that what God tells us?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] Sarah said
[1:14:21] me. No, I'm too old.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe you say I'm too young.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; How many times I hear that? Well, this
[1:14:37] of the message is for the young people.
[1:14:38] I said, stop that.
[1:14:41] Never. Young people, never say you're
[1:14:43] too young for it.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Because we will have babies.
[1:14:47] Yeah.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Walk in a body change.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; So don't tell me you're too young.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; JUST KEEP THE RIGHT kind of attitude.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT, IF IT'S TOO
[1:15:00] MUCH FOR YOU, say thank you, Lord.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you think Mary has understood
[1:15:07] THAT? WHAT GO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HER?
[1:15:09] She said, "My goodness." I mean, this is
[1:15:11] really how and the Holy Ghost shall
[1:15:13] overshadow you. Uhhuh.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; You understand? Yeah,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; come on church.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE ANSWER OF THE ANGEL.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; For me, it would raise even more
[1:15:28] questions.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW, NOW SHE HAD THE RIGHT
[1:15:32] ATTITUDE.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD
[1:15:37] IT IS GOD'S GRACE.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; SO GRACE IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO
[1:15:42] UNDERSTAND TO HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF
[1:15:44] ATTITUDE. SO ALL THAT IS HAPPENING TO
[1:15:47] YOU, YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE
[1:15:49] SAVED BY GRACE.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; My that's why this Bible
[1:16:00] that's why this Bible
[1:16:02] 66 books
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; right
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; 66 books
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; not 33 books.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:17:15] book, the last verses sum it up
[1:17:18] together,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And Mary and Joseph lived happy all the
[1:17:24] days of their life. You know how
[1:17:26] sometimes the story goes. But this this
[1:17:30] Bible ends with a verse. I think you all
[1:17:32] we all know that, right?

[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And I want to say again, favor is not
[1:18:03] fair.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] It it was not fair that I favored my
[1:18:13] wife.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe there was some more that like me.
[1:18:18] I don't know. But maybe.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; So that was not fair.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It was not fair
[1:18:29] that Ahospherus chose Esther.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Because there were other virgins.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; There were other beautiful ladies there.
[1:18:39] But his eyes fell on her.

[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Esther never forget it was the grace of
[1:19:10] God.

[1:19:15] WHEN THAT CAME BACK
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; TO HER THAT SHE WAS WHAT SHE WAS BY THE
[1:19:20] GRACE OF GOD,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; HER ATTITUDE HAS CHANGED. LOOK WHAT WAS
[1:19:25] POSSIBLE.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. LOOK WHAT WAS POSSIBLE.

[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; SHE WENT STRAIGHT UNTO THE KING WITHOUT
[1:19:35] HAVING THE PERMISSION.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHEN THE MYSTERY WAS UNVEILED.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Who she REALLY WAS AND WHAT THE KING
[1:19:43] THOUGHT ABOUT HER.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.

[1:19:51] for her?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; You know that? Yes, sir.
[1:19:59] Because the king knew who she was.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And as Esther would walk into the king,
[1:20:11] she didn't crawl on her knees.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Can imagine when that dawned unto her
[1:20:22] after three days,
[1:20:24] when it became clear, a
[1:20:27] Just the attitude changed.

[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; So as she walked to the king, everybody
[1:20:42] was keeping his breath.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Everybody felt now she is doing
[1:20:47] something that is my goodness.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Who do you who does she think she is?
[1:20:53] Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Is it not the same sorry when I say that
[1:20:58] religious spirit?

[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Who do you think you are?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Is it not exactly how
[1:21:12] he's coming?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And then he's telling you, ah, don't
[1:21:16] forget you are a sinner.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

[1:21:24] My my we we you understand how the how
[1:21:27] the Satan is so so clever. You know how
[1:21:29] the Satan is so clever. He's able to
[1:21:32] tell you the truth.

[1:21:38] [snorts]
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's able
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; because brother Venom said when Satan
[1:21:43] spoke to him, remember brother darkest
[1:21:45] days
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; when he said all that Satan told me was
[1:21:49] the truth. That's right.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE TELLS us that we should
[1:21:55] speak the truth in love.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE TRUTH COMES TO YOU, come
[1:22:01] on, church.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; When the truth COMES TO YOU, NOT IN
[1:22:04] LOVE.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; BUT IN CONDEMNATION,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; always know it's Satan.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, people, brother, sister, if if if
[1:22:18] Come on, church. If Satan comes to you
[1:22:21] with the truth and it makes you
[1:22:22] depressed, it's not God.

[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus had done.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; AS SATAN WAS BRINGING THE TRUTH to him,
[1:22:41] it is written.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; What did Jesus say? It is also written.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; SO, SATAN WAS BRINGING THE TRUTH to him,
[1:22:52] not in love. Don't forget when love is
[1:22:56] projected.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we have to we have to
[1:23:04] get somewhere. But but you understand
[1:23:05] with Job, we have to last time I left
[1:23:08] you, I think a little bit we wanted to
[1:23:11] talk about Moses and Moses and we never
[1:23:12] came to Moses.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; So, forgive me. But uh it's also an
[1:23:16] encouragement that you look it up for
[1:23:19] yourself. [laughter]
[1:23:23] You understand that? Okay. So when a
[1:23:26] minister is missing something
[1:23:30] then you are able enough to find it
[1:23:33] yourself.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen for that?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:23:57] You understand? We reached a place. Oh,
[1:24:00] God help us.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Was Job without a flaw?
[1:24:07] I mean, you read the chapter, you find
[1:24:09] him. He he went to mood swings. I mean,
[1:24:12] he became really low.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; HOW LOW CAN YOU BECOME TO SAY, "CURSE ME
[1:24:17] THE DAY THAT I was born."
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And God calls you perfect,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Brenon would say, and I'm so
[1:24:28] happy he said it. That's why I can say
[1:24:29] it. He said, "Nothing that happened to
[1:24:31] Job was to chastise them, only to prove
[1:24:34] him."
[1:24:35] Yeah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Church, [snorts]
[1:24:39] to a perfect bride of Christ,
[1:24:43] ALL THIS STUFF THAT IS happening is
[1:24:45] [clears throat] only to prove who you
[1:24:46] are.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Because don't tell me that the
[1:24:52] bridegroom has to chastise his bride.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; No. No. Don't take that attitude.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand? Don't take that
[1:25:05] attitude.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Don't take that attitude that I need to
[1:25:12] be punished.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; You see how quickly Satan steps in.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Quickly how he steps. You know how he
[1:25:26] steps in? Not in the church. Not no
[1:25:29] here.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; There's where the greatest battles takes
[1:25:32] place. Yes.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; And there's where you have to meet the
[1:25:35] enemy.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; And brother said when the church can
[1:25:39] discern the working of the TWO SPIRITS
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; WITHIN THEMSSELF.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; So when SATAN THROWS THE TRUTH AT ME
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; and the truth MAKES ME DEPRESSED, I SAY,
[1:25:55] "SATAN, get behind me."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:02] IT'S HIGH TIME, CHURCH, THAT WE believe
[1:26:04] what God spoke about us,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; IT WAS HIGH TIME GOD WAS SO UPSET WITH
[1:26:10] JOB BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T believe what God
[1:26:12] spoke about him.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU COME TO ME WITH SUCH A THING?
[1:26:17] I DECLARED YOU PERFECT.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:26:23] [snorts]
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Who feels perfect?
[1:26:33] Okay, good news.
[1:26:36] That's not the requirement of being
[1:26:39] ready.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I'm ready if I feel good. I'm ready if I
[1:26:47] don't feel good.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's let's let's uh read
[1:26:55] quickly first Thessalonians
[1:26:58] as as we have as we have uh as we have
[1:27:01] had that you know as we said and the
[1:27:03] Lord himself
[1:27:05] the Lord himself shall come down. Amen.
[1:27:10] Allow me to little bit expand on that
[1:27:13] that we really can see where we are
[1:27:14] standing
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; and what God is doing.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And then keeping our attitude.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; I wonder that if the end of the service
[1:27:28] we still can say amen to the word.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; But this is the right kind of attitude.
[1:27:38] Yeah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; You know, again, the angel said, "The
[1:27:43] Holy Spirit to Mary, the Holy Spirit
[1:27:45] will overshadow you."
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Mary was, you know, in what kind of
[1:27:56] situation the angel came
[1:27:59] in a very, very difficult situation.
[1:28:03] Now,
[1:28:05] God, allow me to say that God could have
[1:28:07] done it much easier.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Because God waited till Mary and Joseph
[1:28:14] were engaged.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I mean, he could have done much better.
[1:28:22] Sorry when I say that. Yeah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Because this IS SOMETIMES WHAT WE FEEL.
[1:28:25] OH, THINGS COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER.
[1:28:28] NO, GOD NEED THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES TO
[1:28:30] prove
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; who you are.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; You know that he needs he needed to
[1:28:37] allow that the pit became open.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; He needed hell on earth.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; To show who you are.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:49] [snorts]
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you understand he was marry
[1:28:53] and Joseph situation was very I mean
[1:28:55] JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER would be much
[1:28:57] better.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; But now she was engaged.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You understand how difficult that was
[1:29:03] now?
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Because in Israel there was a law.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; When somebody was engaged that was
[1:29:09] different than when somebody was a lone
[1:29:11] virgin.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; But now she was NOT ONLY A VIRGIN but
[1:29:14] she was an engaged virgin.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And you understand.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If that virgin, if she is engaged,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. and she IS NOT CRYING.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; She has to be stoned.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; There's a different law when she is just
[1:29:35] a virgin.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; But God waited till it became really
[1:29:39] complicated.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Ah, God waited to bring you here.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; You waited. YOU NEVER WAS THERE WHEN THE
[1:29:50] PROPHET was there.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because he had to bring
[1:29:54] you there when it is really complicated.
[1:29:56] [laughter]
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [snorts]
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Lordise.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; just keep the right kind of attitude
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; towards any promise of God.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:13] [snorts]
[1:30:14] [laughter]
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. 1 Thessalonians uh 1
[1:30:18] Thessalonians 4. Let us quickly read as
[1:30:23] and then we want to really see a little
[1:30:25] you know what the prophet said already
[1:30:26] how he identified it with his own
[1:30:28] ministry.
[1:30:32] [snorts] For the Lord himself shall
[1:30:35] descend from heaven with a shout, with
[1:30:38] the voice of the archangel, and with the
[1:30:42] trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[1:30:45] shall rise first.
[1:30:49] Right?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:30:53] Then we who are still alive and remain
[1:30:56] shall be changed.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And we had a prophet We had a prophet
[1:31:03] that could say that the the shout is the
[1:31:07] message.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] The shout is the message.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And then brother Bam said, "The voice of
[1:31:19] the archangel is always Christ."
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Is always Christ.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And I trust you understand how much you
[1:31:35] are involved with it.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; So the angel came to Mary to tell her
[1:31:42] you are involved.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; This angel came to us to tell us
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; we are involved.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Now what kind of attitude?
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. you would have taught that
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; it
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; don't play humble now.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Don't play religious.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Let us face what God said.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; You know Mary never said I think when I
[1:32:13] look to my past when I look to my
[1:32:15] parents when I look to I think this is
[1:32:17] not a good choice.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't know what went on in her
[1:32:26] head,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; You know, all kinds of stuff BECAUSE SHE
[1:32:29] HAD STUFF IN HER FAMILY.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THERE WAS STUFF AROUND
[1:32:34] JOSEPH.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You know that Joseph was a man that was
[1:32:37] married before.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; According to the prophet, he was a man.
[1:32:42] He had four children.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ALL KIND OF STUFF THAT WAS
[1:32:45] GOING ON.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Yes,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; we think it was just a lovely world
[1:32:53] around Mary, you know, everything from
[1:32:55] glory to glory. No, she was in stuff.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; She was in circumstances.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JOSEPH WAS NOT SO HAPPY WHEN
[1:33:02] HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
[1:33:05] [laughter]
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; WHEN JOSEPH HEARD THAT MESSAGE
[1:33:10] AND AND MARY CAME TO HIM AND SAID,
[1:33:12] "HONEY, CAN I tell you something? I'm
[1:33:14] pregnant."
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Joseph never said, "PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:33:17] HALLELUJAH. [laughter]
[1:33:20] He said, "Who is the guy? Who's the
[1:33:22] man?"
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, NO, JOSEPH. NO MAN, NO MAN.
[1:33:27] THE HOLY SPIRIT OVERSHADOW ME.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
[1:33:36] IT EVER HAPPENED.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; THE FIRST TIME IT EVER HAPPENS IS NOW.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU HAPPENED TO
[1:33:44] NOBODY.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:49] Yes sir.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; No, this what happening to the bride is
[1:33:54] special.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; God has has has used the best thing for
[1:34:00] the end.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:34:04] [snorts]
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; So, brother Venom would let us know. Let
[1:34:09] me let me let me quickly read to you
[1:34:10] church age book
[1:34:13] and we [clears throat] will really it's
[1:34:14] it's really amazing
[1:34:17] why the prophet said the word is in the
[1:34:21] bride as it was in Mary.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's it's just so beautiful. Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Now let let me let me let me let us
[1:34:33] quickly see that voice of the archangel.
[1:34:36] Now not not to make any doctrinal point
[1:34:38] and say this is this just relax enjoy
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; you know I I I found out sometimes
[1:34:46] people get very scared when you touch do
[1:34:48] you want to say that now let's face it
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; because the voice of the archangel is
[1:34:56] always CHRIST
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; BUT CHRIST is not alone
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; that's RIGHT
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY ADAM WAS given and helpmate
[1:35:04] Yes.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Not to wash his clothes.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Not to iron his shirts.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; They didn't need because they were
[1:35:16] naked.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; You understand? SO WHEN GOD SAID, "I
[1:35:23] this comes after the fall." You
[1:35:24] understand that? But church,
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; The connection that Christ has to the
[1:35:30] bride goes back as it was before the
[1:35:33] fall. Yes,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I believe this glory will finally change
[1:35:36] our bodies.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; That's why IT WILL BE A DAILY ROUTINE.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU TRY TO FORCE
[1:35:42] YOURSELF INTO.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU PRAY
[1:35:45] YOURSELF INTO.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Something that happens to you.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it will be just a daily
[1:35:56] routine being in the scriptures and in
[1:35:59] the plan of God.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Ask, did you
[1:36:06] ever thought the first Adam why he was
[1:36:10] given a helpmate?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Then you understand why the second Adam,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; the archangel,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; needs a helpmate.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.
[1:36:28] THAT'S WHY THE MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE THERE
[1:36:34] IN EDEN. YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:36:36] Because God was joining them together
[1:36:38] again.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR A PURPOSE. And we understand
[1:36:43] if the fall would not have happened,
[1:36:45] they would have brought forth Jesus
[1:36:47] Christ.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; IS THAT CORRECT? NOT BY SEX, NOT BY
[1:36:51] BIRTH.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:58] And you understand what God is doing.
[1:37:00] Are we living in the time when when the
[1:37:04] the prophet speaks of an invisible union
[1:37:06] of the bride of Christ?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Is an invisible taking place.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; So God is not uniting
[1:37:14] to just his spouse.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; God is uniting with his wife.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's really look. Let's really
[1:37:24] look. Let's really see [sighs] who was
[1:37:28] responsible for Eve.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Not Adam.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; No, God made it very plain. He put Adam
[1:37:39] in a deep sleep.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Who was
[1:37:50] interested in Christ having a bride?
[1:37:54] Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Not Christ.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; No. That's why Robin said God put him to
[1:38:04] sleep
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; at Calvary.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Come on, church.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know why? BECAUSE THIS IS GOD'S
[1:38:13] BUSINESS.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Is it not amazing
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; how it was not Isaac hunting for a
[1:38:20] bride?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; It was Abraham. That's right.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT
[1:38:31] ALMIGHTY GOD THAT WANTS TO UNVEIL
[1:38:33] HIMSELF.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Can we say PRAISE THE LORD?
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF PLANNED YOU HERE. GOD
[1:38:47] HIMSELF BROUGHT YOU HERE.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; God allowed.
[1:38:53] That's right.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Your funny family to be what they are.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. You cannot. Brother said
[1:39:04] he said our our birth is more a misty
[1:39:07] than the virgin birth.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; You know why God NEEDED YOU? EXACTLY.
[1:39:12] BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN
[1:39:15] EXPRESS GOD IN A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE OF
[1:39:17] THIS STUFF.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. RIGHT.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DON'T LET SATAN GET YOU DOWN
[1:39:24] BECAUSE OF THE STUFF AND THE
[1:39:26] CIRCUMSTANCES.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't LET HIM GET YOU DOWN because
[1:39:29] of that.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; When you look at YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES,
[1:39:32] SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD." WHEN ISRAEL WAS
[1:39:34] LOOKING AT ALL THE ENEMIES, THEY SAID,
[1:39:35] "WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE OUR FOOD."
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Church book 340. Allow me to read. you
[1:39:48] know to the to the Li loudian church
[1:39:50] age. Brother Brandham said
[1:39:54] he said speaking of the church and and
[1:39:56] all the uh uh denominations they could
[1:39:58] no longer speak for God. God sent Vesley
[1:40:01] and he was a voice with the word and he
[1:40:03] was and he was the voice with the word
[1:40:06] in his day.
[1:40:08] Amen. The people who took his revelation
[1:40:11] from God became the living epistles read
[1:40:15] and known of all men. right
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; of their generation. When the Methodist
[1:40:22] failed, God raised up others. And so has
[1:40:25] it gone through the years in the last
[1:40:26] days. There's again another people in
[1:40:30] the land.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Now listen very carefully. THAT WHO
[1:40:33] UNDER THEIR messenger
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; will be the final voice to the final
[1:40:38] age.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I ask you a straight question.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Who is your messenger?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Who is your messenger?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Half hour silence.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Who is our messenger?
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; We say brother Brandham.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Partly the truth.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; We will see that a little later. It's
[1:41:15] beautiful.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful, church. Listen what the
[1:41:19] prophety say. So, so she will be under
[1:41:21] HER MESSENGER AND TOO MANY PEOPLE JUST
[1:41:24] LOOK TO WILLIAM
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; BRHAM
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE MESSENGER TO THE
[1:41:28] LOUSY church age.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Brandham said.
[1:41:34] [snorts] He said but she will be the
[1:41:36] final voice to the final age.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:41:43] Hallelujah.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Church, in this hour we are living,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; WE ARE UNDER OUR MESSENGER. AND OUR
[1:41:50] MESSENGER IS NOT JUST WILLIAM BRANDHAM.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; OUR MESSENGER IS THE ARCHANGEL,
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; CHRIST HIMSELF.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; HE IS OUR MESSENGER. AND THE TRUE
[1:42:01] CHURCH, THE WIFE OF THE LAMB.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; WILL BE UNDER HER MESSENGER, THE VOICE.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:11] As Adam has a help meat,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST has a help meet.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's no wonder brother
[1:42:21] Brandham said
[1:42:24] it's more the life that you live
[1:42:28] than what you say.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on church.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Your life is a loud voice.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Even if you cannot speak, even if you're
[1:42:42] so old that you lose your speaking,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; your life
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; is a loud voice.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, we we also we see that a little
[1:42:52] later because you will you it will it's
[1:42:55] quite interesting what caused the Old
[1:42:59] Testament saints to rise.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; It's quite interesting.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; It was someone that was rapture ready.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; And he with A LOUD VOICE,
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; you know WHAT HE SAID? MY GOD, MY GOD,
[1:43:24] why hast thou forsaken me?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Stuff.
[1:43:36] But a man with the right attitude.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lord, if it is possible, let
[1:43:41] this cup depart from me. But not my will
[1:43:44] be done, but thy will be done."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Is it not exactly the same picture?
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:43:56] the time. I'm sorry. Um but I think he's
[1:43:59] wonderful, isn't it? We we don't want to
[1:44:01] miss little things the Holy Spirit is
[1:44:03] really leading us into.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so, uh, I only come I only
[1:44:08] come very seldom. So,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; have have pity with me. Okay.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:18] The voice of God
[1:44:21] will be in her.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it said, listen very
[1:44:31] carefully. It said in the last chapter
[1:44:33] of the Bible, the spirit and the bride
[1:44:36] say come.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] [snorts]
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go further. Don't just you
[1:44:46] know then the Bible said and let's let's
[1:44:49] read first Thessalonians.
[1:44:52] So they hear the the shout with the
[1:44:54] voice of the archangel and we all
[1:44:56] understand how brother Brham is saying
[1:44:58] he does all three things.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. as he is descending.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And as he is descending, we are
[1:45:06] ascending.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Not somewhere into the skies, into a
[1:45:11] position.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. AS HE IS DESCENDING, AS
[1:45:16] HE IS COMING DOWN, WE ARE ascending into
[1:45:19] a position.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; We are ascending to heaven. But heaven
[1:45:25] IS NOT JUST THE CLOUDS THAT you see
[1:45:26] there.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN IS YOUR POSITION in Christ.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Is he descending?
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; He's descending with the voice, with a
[1:45:38] shout, with the voice, and with the
[1:45:40] trump.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; And brother B said, he does all three
[1:45:45] things as he is descending.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Did he descend?
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Did he appear in our days?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; What have we done with the appearing?
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Did he appear in our days? The prophet
[1:45:58] said there's a great difference between
[1:45:59] between the appearing and the coming.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; You know what the difference is? The
[1:46:04] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; She is the difference.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; It was an appearing and it is a coming.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID GENESIS 18, AND THE LORD
[1:46:15] APPEARED UNTO ABRAHAM.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; IT TURNED OUT INTO THE COMING OF THE
[1:46:19] SON.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Don't get don't get confused
[1:46:24] and I'm saying that.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We see the appearing and now we
[1:46:28] are waiting for the coming
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; and then the Bible said will be a secret
[1:46:31] coming.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right? A secret coming. Come on
[1:46:34] church.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; And brother I'm so so easily he's taking
[1:46:38] he taking examples of you know the great
[1:46:41] play and Romeo and Julia. He just brings
[1:46:42] it in.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; The nobody nobody knew that Romeo was
[1:46:48] around
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; because he came secret.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; He came as a thief in the night.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? THAT IS EXACTLY NOT WHAT
[1:46:57] he's coming for.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; He's not a thief, BUT HE COMES AS A
[1:47:01] THIEF. WHAT IS A GOOD THIEF DOING? A
[1:47:03] good thief when he comes to your house,
[1:47:05] he doesn't steal what everybody can buy.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; HE STEALS THE MOST VALUABLE thing you
[1:47:12] have.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THAT HE COMES AS EVE, WHO HE'S
[1:47:17] HE'S COMING TO STEAL THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:47:19] CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And remember, nobody nobody was aware
[1:47:24] that Romeo was present.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; No. No. Come on, CHURCH.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; ONLY THE WATCHMAN IN THE TOWER, he could
[1:47:37] tell us. Is that right? Come on, CHURCH.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; ONLY THE WATCHMAN IN THE TOWER, HE COULD
[1:47:43] TELL US, "MY MINISTRY IS TO DECLARE unto
[1:47:46] you that he is here now."
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram, WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS
[1:47:54] HE? WHERE IS HE? BROTHER COULD SAY HE
[1:47:57] lives in me.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; With other words, I am he.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; You understand? The only proof that
[1:48:10] Romeo was present was when Julia was
[1:48:14] gone. Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; That was the only proof.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet could say this
[1:48:23] second coming
[1:48:25] is a bright coming
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but but but but really stay
[1:48:33] with me for for a couple of couple of
[1:48:35] minutes because now that the trump the
[1:48:37] trump of God I think it's so it's let
[1:48:39] let me the trump of God
[1:48:43] and allow me to say that only to make it
[1:48:46] clear. Yes,
[1:48:48] it's not the trump of Christ.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; It's a trump of God.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; So we understand that it was God always
[1:49:05] responsible
[1:49:08] for the woman.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; God was responsible.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Not Adam.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; God was responsible for you being here.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:21] So has God loved the world
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; that he gave his only begotten son.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; That's the scriptures that we all but
[1:49:32] what kind of world God is loving.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; When John is telling a little bit later,
[1:49:37] if you love the world and the things of
[1:49:39] the world, the love of God is not in
[1:49:40] you.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WORLD GOD LOVES? WHY DID GOD
[1:49:47] GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON?
[1:49:50] because of you.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF YOU.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD NEEDS YOU.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; SO IT IS THE TRUMP OF GOD SHALL SOUND.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's so beautiful, church.
[1:50:16] If you want to understand the Bible
[1:50:17] types, it becomes so easy and so so
[1:50:19] simple.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing that a king was making
[1:50:22] marriage for his son?
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; A king was making marriage,
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; not the son was making marriage for him.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And it was a king, YOU KNOW, GETTING UP
[1:50:33] GET PEOPLE TOGETHER.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; For the wedding, right? IT WAS A KING
[1:50:37] THAT WAS UPSET WHEN NOBODY WANTED to
[1:50:39] come. That's right.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; I, as a father, would be happy
[1:50:43] because it's cheaper wedding.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THE FATHER WAS UPSET.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? THE FATHER WAS UPSET
[1:50:52] THAT SOMEBODY REFUSES TO COME TO THE
[1:50:54] WEDDING.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] Go to Matthew 22.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Find me the bride there.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Find me the bride in this parable.
[1:51:12] [laughter]
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:15] Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Why? You know why he's inviting?
[1:51:21] Because he needs a bride.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Finally, you know what? He invites bad
[1:51:27] and good.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Never develop the
[1:51:32] attitude, I'm better than the other one.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; No. You are chosen by grace.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Grace, it's an unmmerited favor. And
[1:51:44] favor is not fair.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Ah, come on church. No, that favor is
[1:51:50] not fair.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Jacob and Eso, you speak of fair.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THEY WERE BORN,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; You understand how easy it becomes?
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, my goodness, church.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; We could sit here just walking into a
[1:52:08] body change.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will be one day, church. It
[1:52:11] will be one day. If it is not now, then
[1:52:13] maybe tomorrow. Maybe in 10 years, maybe
[1:52:15] in 20 years. I don't care how long it
[1:52:16] takes.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; If he keeps us longer on earth, he has
[1:52:20] more to show off himself,
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; right? That's his choice,
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; that's his choice,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; even if he feels we change A LITTLE BIT
[1:52:28] THE PROGRAM, we leave it a little bit
[1:52:30] longer. IT'S BECAUSE HE WANT TO SHOW
[1:52:32] MORE OF HIMSELF. AND WE WHEN HE HAS A
[1:52:34] BRIDE ON EARTH THAT HE CAN USE, HE'S
[1:52:37] HAPPY TO SHOW MORE OF HIMSELF.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:44] AMEN. Let me read quickly to you.
[1:52:48] [snorts]
[1:52:49] Brother Ram said, "Look, if there's a
[1:52:51] whole bunch of trumpets laying here and
[1:52:53] one of them had a sound of a certain
[1:52:55] music, it is the man them trumpets are
[1:52:59] perfectly mute." [clears throat]
[1:53:01] Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; It is the fellow that can sound the
[1:53:07] trumpet.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; That knows what he is going to do.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; You know who sounds the trumpet?
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; It's a trump of God.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; But Christ sounds the trumpet.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And that Christ is here.
[1:53:34] How can I be
[1:53:36] a trump?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; It's not a trumpet never tries to play
[1:53:46] itself.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Is it correct?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Very simple. It cannot.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; So don't try to do. You cannot.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; You only make a fool out of yourself.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; The trumpet has nothing to do with it.
[1:54:02] The sound comes from an intelligence
[1:54:04] behind it.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Sorry when I get get upset emotional.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet said the last thing that
[1:54:15] comes to the church
[1:54:17] is the intelligence.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And do you believe the intelligence is
[1:54:24] here?
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how is intelligence been
[1:54:28] proven?
[1:54:32] Well, if you are stupid or clever, you
[1:54:34] prove it with your body.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; So, how is intelligence proven?
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; It's not wavering to the room. And
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; it's proven in you and me.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. [snorts] All men are the
[1:54:55] same. All Christians are the same.
[1:54:57] There's no great men amongst us. We are
[1:55:00] not great men nor great women. We are
[1:55:03] all brothers and sisters. All the same
[1:55:05] in the same bracket. We There's no great
[1:55:09] one doesn't make one greater than the
[1:55:11] other. Not one thing. We are just human
[1:55:13] beings.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; If we can just stay in that attitude.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. and allow the master
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; to play.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Allow the master to play [snorts]
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; now. Shout voice
[1:55:37] and trump
[1:55:40] and then the dead in Christ shall rise.
[1:55:42] Where are we standing church?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Where are we standing? Is that right?
[1:55:46] Where are we standing?
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [snorts] Now we can say I would
[1:55:50] allow me allow me to to do that. That
[1:55:52] was the seventh seal by the way about
[1:55:54] the trumpets to really see that the
[1:55:56] trumpet has nothing to do with that.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; It's the trump of God.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? Is it Is it okay?
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Because it says the trump of God, not
[1:56:06] the trump of Christ. IT WAS ALWAYS GOD
[1:56:10] interested
[1:56:12] in getting Adam a wife.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Christ a bride. Amen.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; It was always the father. You know why?
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help us. It was the unveiling of
[1:56:24] God.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; I trust you understand that
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; this is what we are in is the unveiling
[1:56:34] of God. YEAH,
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD IS CHOOSING A BRIDE FOR
[1:56:37] CHRIST
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; to that's why Abraham
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; was so anxious to get a wife for Isaac
[1:56:44] and he told Eleazar don't get to that
[1:56:47] place only go to a certain place
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; isn't it amazing
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; so it was not Isaac saying you know
[1:56:53] Eleazar take care don't go to you know
[1:56:56] no it was Abraham
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; but it was not his wife
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; BUT ABRAHAM KNEW
[1:57:05] EVERYTHING THAT ISAAC BRING FORTH IS AN
[1:57:08] expression further expression of me.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; OH, EVERYTHING THAT CHRIST WILL BRING
[1:57:15] FORTH IS AN EXPRESSION OF GOD.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; This is the unveiling of God.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; the unveiling of God.
[1:57:34] church. No wonder
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; brother Brennan would say desperation.
[1:57:40] Let me read that to you.
[1:57:48] And now
[1:57:50] the entire Holy Ghost
[1:57:54] visits the church
[1:57:57] making God in human flesh.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Just sing only believe all things are
[1:58:11] possible. THAT'S WHY THE ANGEL OF THE
[1:58:14] LORD LIKED THAT SONG. YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; This is what he wants to hear from you.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's possible. That's possible
[1:58:22] with me.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; That's possible with me. IN MY
[1:58:24] CIRCUMSTANCES, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:58:34] [sighs]
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Who really is the messenger to the final
[1:58:41] age?
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; I have a little I have a little uh
[1:58:46] brother um can you can you bring up the
[1:58:49] the the
[1:58:51] I thought it it might be a little help
[1:58:53] to really understand what happened in
[1:58:55] our day and when the prophet is saying
[1:58:58] she will be under her messenger
[1:59:01] what he is really talking about
[1:59:05] Amen.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:08] [snorts]
[1:59:09] This is actually uh uh takes a while to
[1:59:12] get used to it. But uh you understand
[1:59:15] this is the church ages from Ephesus,
[1:59:17] Smyrna, Pergam, Taratara, Zadis,
[1:59:20] Philadelphia, and Ludicia. And then
[1:59:23] there is the messengers from Paul,
[1:59:25] Arinius, Martin, Columbus, Luther,
[1:59:26] Wesley and
[1:59:29] uh brother Brham,
[1:59:31] right? And then we have there uh the
[1:59:34] years from from zero I I brought it zero
[1:59:37] to 2023
[1:59:39] right we are further than that but 2023
[1:59:43] uh Ephesus and Leoia was at the same
[1:59:46] time span
[1:59:48] right
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; yeah it was 2023 you know normally we
[1:59:53] used to say uh brother said uh uh
[1:59:56] ludicial will be a very short age he
[1:59:59] actually not say the shortest
[2:00:01] He said a very short one.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; So from 2023, Laudisia is not the
[2:00:08] shortest.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; But Ephesus is right.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. That's why I only took to 2023
[2:00:15] just for clearance. Then you have the
[2:00:18] years of the church ages, how long they
[2:00:20] were 117 and so on and so on. 119 117
[2:00:24] and so and so on. And uh the messengers
[2:00:28] also behind the messengers I have put
[2:00:29] the age. how old they became. And this
[2:00:33] is all uh historical. You can just go
[2:00:35] ahead and look it up for yourself. So
[2:00:37] this you don't need to be very spiritual
[2:00:39] for that. It's just very simple. Okay.
[2:00:43] But what is very amazing, you know, I I
[2:00:45] I I used to just take it for granted
[2:00:50] that I knew that the the messenger
[2:00:53] always comes at the end of the age.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Everybody agrees? Everybody is familiar
[2:00:58] with that?
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:00] And I I say that also to un to to to
[2:01:04] really to recognize that we have
[2:01:07] spiritual people sometimes in the church
[2:01:11] [snorts]
[2:01:12] was once I preached that
[2:01:15] just normal. I quoted the prophet so
[2:01:17] many times. He said, "And the messenger
[2:01:19] always comes at the end of the age." And
[2:01:21] this was I had a sister coming to me out
[2:01:23] of my church. She said, "Brother Andrew,
[2:01:25] do you know that the messenger comes
[2:01:28] always at the end of the former age?"
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; And I said to her, "Sister, that must be
[2:01:34] the truth."
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; okay.
[2:01:41] So, and I've written it down. It takes a
[2:01:44] while, but uh it's not so important that
[2:01:45] we get everything.
[2:01:48] Paul, when did Paul came on the scene?
[2:01:52] He was a messenger to the Ephesian
[2:01:55] churches. Is that right?
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; But he never came at the end of Ephesus.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Can I read to you few statements of the
[2:02:06] prophet? It helped me. It helped me
[2:02:09] really much to uh I give you only two or
[2:02:12] three. Um
[2:02:15] it's in the first seal. He said we first
[2:02:18] seal page 114. We found in studying of
[2:02:21] the scripture that the messenger to the
[2:02:23] age come right at the end of the age.
[2:02:26] Every time Paul came at the end of the
[2:02:28] age. We find out that Arremius came at
[2:02:31] the end of the age. Martin at the end.
[2:02:33] Lut came at the end of the Catholic age.
[2:02:36] That the first time he's more precise
[2:02:38] first of the Catholic age. WESLEY AT THE
[2:02:40] END OF the Lutheran age.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAID AND PENTECOST AT THE END OF THE
[2:02:46] AGE OF SANCTIFICATION.
[2:02:50] AMEN.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[2:02:54] brother said further in the in the
[2:02:55] message countdown, I just I just want to
[2:02:57] read you the quotes because I think it's
[2:02:59] it's good to know that they are there.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because it it's quite
[2:03:05] quite amazing and I think also important
[2:03:07] that we understand under what kind of
[2:03:10] messenger
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; we will become the voice.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:15] You know, if Christ wouldn't have come
[2:03:16] down in this age, we could never be the
[2:03:18] voice.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Because always Christ is the voice of
[2:03:26] the archangel.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Random was not the voice of the
[2:03:34] archangel.
[2:03:35] Yeah.
[2:03:40] [snorts]
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And remember this is out of countdown.
[2:03:43] Remember the messenger comes at the end
[2:03:46] of the former message always.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; The messenger comes at the end of the
[2:03:54] former message.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Always.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; And just only to make it even more
[2:04:04] plain,
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; brother Random said Paul came at the end
[2:04:10] of Judaism.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; You can type that in. That's what he
[2:04:16] said.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Paul didn't came at the end of Ephesus.
[2:04:20] Actually, Paul died at at 10. Can I say
[2:04:24] AD? At 10. And he died 67. His church
[2:04:29] age started in 53 and ended in 170.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Okay, go with me. It's it's quite nice.
[2:04:38] Now, Ireneius was not born at the or
[2:04:41] came not to the church age or to the to
[2:04:46] to the world, let's say, at the end of
[2:04:49] Smyrna, but at the end of Ephesus.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; So, always the prophet comes at the end
[2:04:55] of the former. That's right. [snorts]
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Something that will that shook me off my
[2:05:00] chair when I saw that.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; It really I was as I was looking at it
[2:05:05] I'm a German and you normally I know how
[2:05:08] to behave myself.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; But when I saw that I'm happy nobody was
[2:05:13] around.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; I said that that's that really it it
[2:05:18] shocked me. I must be honest.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Go a little further. We then go we go we
[2:05:23] go. Martin came at the end of Smyrna,
[2:05:26] right? Cola,
[2:05:28] keep your breath.
[2:05:30] Columba came at the end of Paragamon. So
[2:05:34] Cola was born in 529,
[2:05:37] died at 5
[2:05:40] 97.
[2:05:42] His church age started according to what
[2:05:47] the Holy Spirit
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; gave his Okay.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You with me?
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; His church age started 606.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; That means Cola lived not one day
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; in the church age that he was a
[2:06:06] messenger to.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; You can you can go in history, you can
[2:06:12] find out. To me, it was it JUST MADE
[2:06:15] THAT TYPE SO CLEAR. YES.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; So when did the messenger
[2:06:23] [snorts] you understand it's sometimes
[2:06:24] very we speak of the Pentecostal age.
[2:06:26] You know how many times brother Brandon
[2:06:27] would say we have the western age the
[2:06:29] Lutan age and the Pentecostal age.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; You know why he did that? Because he
[2:06:33] couldn't say Brham age.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; It's very simple.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; He said Lutheran vessel but he couldn't
[2:06:38] say Brham.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; That's why he said Pentecostal age.
[2:06:42] Right.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You with me? Speaking of the Laudisian
[2:06:46] church age, is that right?
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Yes. [snorts] And so we we
[2:06:51] understand we understand. Now, now let's
[2:06:54] go on. Let's Luther. Luther came not at
[2:06:56] the end of Zadis,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; but he came at the end of Tayotara.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Of the long Catholic age, brother called
[2:07:04] it.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; He came at the end of that. Luther came.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Vestam said came at the end of Lutheran
[2:07:10] age. He said, "And Pentecost with other
[2:07:12] words, the messenger to the seven church
[2:07:15] age, William Brham, came not at the end
[2:07:18] of Ludicia,
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; but came at the end of Philadelphia."
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's why most Pentecostal movements
[2:07:26] have William Brham as their founder.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Right? You can look in
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; in historical things. Most Pentecostal
[2:07:36] movements have William Brham as the
[2:07:39] founder.
[2:07:40] Is that right?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; You're with me.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; So,
[2:07:49] who is the one that comes at the end of
[2:07:50] Lisia
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; that brother spoke of?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; No wonder it's not an eight messenger.
[2:07:58] Don't worry.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; No, no. It's not somebody from Germany
[2:08:01] or somebody from the States or whatever.
[2:08:02] Whatever. Whatever.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; As I SAID, THE ARCHANGEL ALWAYS IS
[2:08:07] CHRIST.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; I think we are too old for that. Right.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; We are too old. This happened too many
[2:08:15] times that somebody is the eight
[2:08:16] messenger and
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; and
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; poof nothing came out of it.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; So you understand? So when brother Adam
[2:08:25] SPEAK YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT
[2:08:27] BECAME BECAUSE WILLIAM BRANDHAM HAD TO
[2:08:30] DO WITH that
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; because William Brham it WAS NOT LIKE
[2:08:34] JOHN THE BAPTIST THAT ONLY HAD ONE
[2:08:36] MINISTRY.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAN DIDN'T HAD ONLY THE MINISTRY
[2:08:42] OF THE FORERUNNER. He did not only had
[2:08:44] the MINISTRY OF THE CHURCH MESSENGER.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. That's right.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't ONLY HAD THE MINISTRY OF
[2:08:50] MOSES. HE ALSO HAD THE MINISTRY of
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Joshua. That's right.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; No wonder Raanam said two of us cannot
[2:09:01] be at the same time. If that is RIGHT
[2:09:03] THAT HE IS HERE,
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; then I must decrease and he must
[2:09:07] increase.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Is that correct? From from whom he was
[2:09:10] speaking, he's speaking of Christ.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; HE'S SPEAKING OF THE ARCHANGEL.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN BROTHER ADAM LEFT THE
[2:09:18] SCENE, CHRIST DID NOT LEAVE THE SCENE.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; And we understand then it was brother
[2:09:29] Ranom actually he was the one
[2:09:34] who called it. Allow me to read that to
[2:09:37] you
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; only.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Because you know I say many times people
[2:09:42] I'm not guilty of that.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; I would never use that word bride age
[2:09:47] unless brother Venom would have brought
[2:09:49] it.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] He said, "We are
[2:09:53] not living in the Pentecostal
[2:09:57] age."
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; We are not living in a Pentecostal age.
[2:10:02] We are living in another age. See, we're
[2:10:04] not living in the Methodist age. We're
[2:10:06] living in another age. We are living up
[2:10:08] here to the bride age. The calling out
[2:10:09] of the church and getting it together
[2:10:11] for the rapture. That's the age that we
[2:10:14] are now living. To my honest opinion,
[2:10:16] that's exactly the truth.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] [snorts]
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's very e it's very simple
[2:10:23] actually. It's like goan in Egypt.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; I mean we are still living in ludicia,
[2:10:29] right?
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; We are still living in Laisia.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; But don't
[2:10:35] live in Lisia.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; I'm still in Loisia like Abraham.
[2:10:41] Abraham was not in Sodom but he lived
[2:10:43] under Sodom. Under Sodom conditions
[2:10:46] 100%. And his WIFE WAS INFLUENCED. COME
[2:10:49] ON CHURCH. HIS WIFE WAS INFLUENCED.
[2:10:50] THAT'S WHY HER ATTITUDE CHANGED.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE INFLUENCED by the loudian. Oh
[2:10:55] yes.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; Loudia means people's rights.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; You see how how another line just opens,
[2:11:09] right?
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; I trust you're not upset that we don't
[2:11:12] take that line. [laughter]
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So So hey, come on, church.
[2:11:27] No, it is not wrong
[2:11:30] [snorts]
[2:11:31] that somebody told the prophet,
[2:11:35] "Pick up the pen
[2:11:37] and write." It is right.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; It was the same one
[2:11:47] telling to the seventh angel to the
[2:11:50] messenger of Laudisia.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:56] Yeah. Amen.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; And who was the messenger to the seven
[2:12:00] church age? To the seven church age.
[2:12:02] William Brham.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you can understand
[2:12:06] there's a change.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; There's a change going on.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Because when you who is declaring the
[2:12:17] message to the church age, the
[2:12:19] messenger.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; He is actually because it said in the
[2:12:23] Bible to the messenger of Lou is right.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; So that writing he should read
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; to the church age.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Right. And you know what IT WAS TO THE
[2:12:33] CHURCH AGE? FULL OF COMPLAIN.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; You read it. Come on.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; You read the letter that is to the
[2:12:41] church age WRITTEN OR SPOKEN BY THE now
[2:12:44] we understand.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; We understand sometimes statements
[2:12:49] brother Brennan is doing that has
[2:12:51] nothing to do with the bride.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on church. Yeah,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; because he WAS ALSO THE MESSENGER TO
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Louia
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; and read it. We don't have the time to
[2:13:06] read it as we can revelation 3:14 how it
[2:13:10] is there. I have against thee. YEAH. YOU
[2:13:12] WHAT IT SAID.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; But what happened one day, brother said,
[2:13:17] I was just there and the Holy Spirit
[2:13:19] told me, pick up your pen and write.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [sighs]
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; That was not a message to
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Loudicia.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Right. No, sure not.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; But that was a message
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; to the brides.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Allow me to say in the bride age.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not another age. We
[2:13:46] understand that. It's no no no.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; But is it not simple?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. IN EGYPT BEFORE THE EXODUS, they
[2:13:53] had a place called Goan
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; where they could go and live. And in
[2:13:57] Goan, it was light. In Egypt, IT WAS
[2:13:59] LIGHT. AT DAY TIME, THEY HAD TO GO BACK
[2:14:01] TO WORK IN EGYPT. At evening time, THEY
[2:14:03] WOULD COME BACK TO GOAN.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; So, it's not really another age, but
[2:14:13] it's ANOTHER PHASE.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; AND I CANNOT CHANGE IT BECAUSE GOD SAID
[2:14:17] TO THE PROPHET, PICK UP YOUR PEN AND
[2:14:18] WRITE. [cheering]
[2:14:20] IN that letter, he's telling us the word
[2:14:24] is in the bride as it was in Mary.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; SO, THAT MEANS THE ONLY THING FOR YOUR
[2:14:34] BODY, come on, FOR YOUR BODY TO CHANGE
[2:14:37] is to keep the right kind OF ATTITUDES
[2:14:39] TOWARDS ANYTHING THAT GOD is saying
[2:14:41] about you.
[2:14:42] Yeah.
[2:14:48] [panting]
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's And I I want to ask you again,
[2:14:51] are you rapture ready?
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Who feels rapture ready now?
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; A little bit more, right?
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; And then brother Random would say,
[2:15:03] "Christ, give give me Yeah, I know it's
[2:15:05] late. Sorry." Um
[2:15:08] then brother Ram said Christ the mystery
[2:15:10] of God revealed such an amazing
[2:15:13] statement and as as I said we just went
[2:15:15] at home with the church through the to
[2:15:18] the the great how the great how brother
[2:15:21] Ranom said in Christ the mystery of God
[2:15:24] revealed. He said the great mystery of
[2:15:28] how
[2:15:30] is still a secret. Amen.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; At the end of the sermon said that
[2:15:37] secret is not revealed.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; He said then he goes further. He said he
[2:15:44] doesn't has not showed because when they
[2:15:46] asked Jesus when it will be they never
[2:15:49] asked Jesus how it will come.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Remember
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; they asked Jesus when it will come.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said not even the son knoweth
[2:16:00] [clears throat] the hour. Right.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, brother Wam said the how
[2:16:06] and the when is still a secret.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; And you know how many confusion came up
[2:16:13] when the when was touched.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Right. [laughter]
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER ADAM TOUCHED THE WHEN.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; 1977.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; So he was there to touch the how.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on, church.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. He was he has because IF
[2:16:31] SATAN KNOWS THE how
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; he would cause a great confusion.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Very simple.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; It's the how. It's the attitude.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; It's the how you do things.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:17:00] and in that message, brother Ram said,
[2:17:01] "No, the how is a secret. Nobody knows."
[2:17:07] He said, "No, he has showed and revealed
[2:17:11] it
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; in every type of the Bible."
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; And you know, I'm from Germany. I'm not
[2:17:18] so clever. So I said, "If
[2:17:23] the rapture, the how is a secret, I want
[2:17:28] to see in the Bible of the characters
[2:17:32] how the how worked."
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:17:37] And I'm so glad the prophet said there
[2:17:40] were three raptures in the Old
[2:17:41] Testament.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; And three raptures in the New Testament.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; We are number five,
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; right? Is that okay?
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; And he said he has shown it in the types
[2:17:52] of the and ALL THE LIFE OF THE believers
[2:17:54] in the Bible.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Unveil that great mystery of how.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; So as simple as I am, I said okay
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; let's look to Enoch.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Let's look to Enoch. Right.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Right. He was he was brother said he was
[2:18:15] right. Seemingly he reached a point and
[2:18:19] he had before his translation he had
[2:18:21] that testimony
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; that he pleased God.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT FAITH it's impossible to
[2:18:28] please God.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; AND AS WE SAID in the beginning it is
[2:18:31] your daily routine.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; IT IS your daily routine.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; How many times we miss that simplicity
[2:18:43] of perfect faith? Amen.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. I always say when you are
[2:18:48] when you are when you are healed, you
[2:18:52] need a special faith.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; When you're not healed,
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; you need more faith.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; How many people How many people they go
[2:19:06] off because God doesn't heal them.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; So, when your healing doesn't come to
[2:19:12] you quick, you need faith.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Abraham by faith. We
[2:19:16] couldn't go in in in chapter 11 of
[2:19:18] Hebrews. It's funny what happens by or
[2:19:21] interesting what happens by faith.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BY FAITH they were cut into
[2:19:26] pieces.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Sarah. By faith.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Okay, we leave that there. Amen. Come
[2:19:38] on, church.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand as we have all
[2:19:42] those types quickly quickly because we
[2:19:44] want to run those types. It's very
[2:19:45] amazing because as we see those
[2:19:48] characters in the Bible now and we
[2:19:50] really see they made it already right
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; they walked into their translation.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
[2:20:00] And their life tells a story.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:05] Let's a little bit look at the life of
[2:20:06] them and to see what it means to be
[2:20:09] rapture ready.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; First, I think first we don't stay too
[2:20:14] long with Enoch because it will take
[2:20:16] another two hours to stay with Enoch
[2:20:18] because he was just a special man. But
[2:20:21] Enoch had the same trouble
[2:20:24] that I had.
[2:20:27] He said, "How do you know? Because he's
[2:20:29] the type."
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Right.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; He was the seventh from Adam.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; We are the seventh from the second Adam.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; SO WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ME happened to
[2:20:44] him.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; And Enoch and and Yeah. Enoch in that in
[2:20:55] his fallen stage
[2:20:58] came to a place that he pleased God
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; before his translation.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; He was a sinner. HE WAS BORN IN SIN.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; And I wanted even to say the blood of
[2:21:12] Jesus Christ was not shed at that time.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:19] What can we do today
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; after the blood is shed?
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Is that right? COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE STANDING?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE church mouse.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Who told you that you are a grasshopper?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; ISRAEL SAID WE ARE GRASSHOPPERS. WHO
[2:21:39] TOLD YOU?
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; He He said TO HE TELLS WHO TOLD YOU THAT
[2:21:46] YOU WERE NAKED?
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:53] Amen. Well, surely Enoch was a was a
[2:21:58] interesting man.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Very interesting man.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; As you are.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; You know that you are special.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; You know why you are special? Because he
[2:22:10] chose you.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; That's why you are special.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Not because you come from Ohio. Not
[2:22:15] because you come from this church or I
[2:22:17] come from Germany or or I'm white or I'm
[2:22:19] black or whatever whatever. So we are
[2:22:22] we are of value because he chose us.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; It's it's very interesting with Enoch.
[2:22:32] It's very interesting with Enoch. The
[2:22:33] Bible tells us that all of his days were
[2:22:37] 365
[2:22:40] years.
[2:22:42] Is that right?
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is now you always must
[2:22:45] remember um who wrote that?
[2:22:49] Who wrote that?
[2:22:51] It was not Enoch. Enoch was not writing
[2:22:53] about himself.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; He said not I was that age and
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; No, it was Moses.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Who came how many years later?
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I think Moses came about 1,000 or more
[2:23:04] years later.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; To write Genesis.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; No. No. Moses was not there when it
[2:23:12] happened.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God could Yeah. He,
[2:23:15] you know, he wasn't there.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; So when Moses saw it, I we could say he
[2:23:20] saw it audio and video. He saw it
[2:23:23] vision. In a vision.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; And that's how he wrote everything down.
[2:23:27] What he saw by vision.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that Moses wrote that?
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. But he was not there.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; When it happened.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:40] It's not first Adam.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; It's Genesis in Germany. It's the first
[2:23:48] book of Moses.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's not first Adam.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't wrote the story about
[2:23:58] himself.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; It was Moses.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Wrote what happened.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; And Moses wrote what he saw as a vision.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. You know what a prophet
[2:24:09] is? Yes. That's why Ram said, "A
[2:24:11] prophet, the word comes to the prophet."
[2:24:12] A prophet is an unveiler and the
[2:24:14] revealer of the word of God.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; You what? What? What? What Moses Moses
[2:24:20] saw in a vision? He wrote down. THAT'S
[2:24:22] WHY HE COULD WRITE DOWN HE LIVED 365
[2:24:25] YEARS.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAW THE
[2:24:28] VISION.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Do we believe he saw the vision?
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A PROPHET. HE WAS A MAN SENT FROM
[2:24:37] GOD. WILLIAM RENA WAS HIS NAME and he
[2:24:39] was telling in so many times you can
[2:24:41] hear him preach and tell tell the story
[2:24:43] and he he he just said he just said you
[2:24:45] can have it on tape. He said I just see
[2:24:48] as Adam and Eve walk in the garden of
[2:24:50] Eden and he said and I hear the bloody
[2:24:52] skin lapping on their legs.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; And everybody got emotional. Oh, what a
[2:24:57] nice story. Next day brother comes. Next
[2:25:00] day the prophet comes back to the pulpit
[2:25:03] and he said, "Do you remember how
[2:25:04] yesterday evening we spoke of Adam and
[2:25:06] Eve as I saw in a vision?"
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; And you will be amazed what brother
[2:25:17] Brandham is saying about Enoch. You know
[2:25:19] that brother Bam said that Enoch walked
[2:25:20] with God 500 years.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Only not one time brother is saying he
[2:25:26] walked 365.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. He only said he
[2:25:29] walked 500.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; So, Enoch was a special man. Is that
[2:25:32] right?
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; According to my mathematics that I have
[2:25:37] out of the Bible, Enoch and Noah didn't
[2:25:39] know one another.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; There 70 years of a lab.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; And God said they knew one. Brother said
[2:25:48] they knew one another.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Actually, brother said they preached
[2:25:52] together.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, let let me read it to you. Amen.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Third seal brother said like Noah kept
[2:26:01] watching Enoch. When Enoch went, Noah
[2:26:04] said better get close to the ark.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; The time is at 10. Noah kept watching
[2:26:10] Enoch.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; First seal. What was it like Enoch? You
[2:26:14] know, Noah watched Enoch. For when Enoch
[2:26:17] come up missing, he knowed judgment was
[2:26:20] at hand.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Then he was hanging around the ark.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:26] Amen.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; So, but normally when Noah was born,
[2:26:30] Enoch was gone already,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; I I I trust I can say that
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; we are gone already.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. To make it very simple, I can say
[2:26:46] I'm not what I want to be,
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; but I'm not what I was.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; quickly then we start with Enoch. But
[2:26:59] Enoch was a man like like brother Adam
[2:27:01] said finally at the at the at the end
[2:27:03] let's say it that way after 500 years.
[2:27:06] Okay. But at the end God said to uh God
[2:27:09] said to God said to uh Enoch, Enoch,
[2:27:13] I think I think you're tired
[2:27:16] walking under solemn conditions.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Enoch said yes I'm tired.
[2:27:24] Yeah, that's what he said.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Then God said to him, "Okay, Enoch, when
[2:27:28] you're tired, come up."
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; And Enoch said, "Okay."
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Daily routine.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Remember that colored brother? I think
[2:27:44] the prophet spoke about him that came
[2:27:46] one morning, one Sunday morning to
[2:27:48] church and the whole church was totally
[2:27:49] torn to pieces. And that old colored
[2:27:52] brother came in and he looked around and
[2:27:54] everybody was upset, you know, everybody
[2:27:56] was crying, running around. He said,
[2:27:57] "Hey, hey, what's up? What's going on?"
[2:28:00] He said, "The rapture has taken place.
[2:28:02] Have you not heard it?"
[2:28:04] He looked, he said, "That's funny." He
[2:28:07] said, "I spoke to him this morning and
[2:28:10] he never said a word of it, [laughter]
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; church."
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; It will be so simple.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:19] It cannot happen without you.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. DON'T LET THE ENEMY TELL
[2:28:26] YOU DIFFERENT. IT CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT
[2:28:28] YOU.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord?
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; KEEP THAT ATTITUDE.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY HE SENT A MESSAGE TO YOU
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE SPECIAL.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:44] [snorts]
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Genesis 5:21-24
[2:28:49] tells us that he lived so long and then
[2:28:52] God took him. It make makes it very
[2:28:54] plain.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; God took him and he was not.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; What means that he was not?
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; You know that I'm not what I was.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; I once was blind,
[2:29:13] but I'm not blind anymore.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because now I can see
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; and God took him and Enoch was not
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; right
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; now to make it to to wound it up the
[2:29:26] work God taking him means marriage
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; you can look it upraise
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; God took him means a marriage took place
[2:29:37] did a marriage took place in our day
[2:29:39] revelation 10:1-7 COME ON CHURCH we had
[2:29:42] a prophet on the scene
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; IS THAT S IS THIS THE YES, SIR.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS TAKING REVELATION 10:1-7.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; IS that correct?
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1 is Christ. Revelation
[2:29:54] 10:7 is the marriage counselor.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on, read the breach. Read the
[2:30:00] breach.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; When brother Adam SPEAKS OF THE LAMB
[2:30:03] TAKING THE BOOK, THEN BROTHER MAKES A
[2:30:05] STATEMENTS, LET HIM COME FORTH WHEN HE
[2:30:08] WILL.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; And in the same message, brother
[2:30:10] Brandham said the prophet would say he's
[2:30:13] turning to the audience. HE SAID, "SPEAK
[2:30:16] NOW OR FOREVER hold your peace."
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; You can read it all in the sermon. WHAT
[2:30:20] IS HAPPENING? A MARRIAGE TAKES PLACE.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; And his yes is when he takes the book.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Who is the book?
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Who is the book?
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; Who is the book? Come on. Who's the
[2:30:35] book?
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; SO, HE COMES DOWN AND HE TAKES YOU FOR
[2:30:38] MARRIAGE.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; AS HE TOOK ENOCH for marriage and Enoch
[2:30:42] was not.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:48] Hallelujah.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; What can we do now? Like Enoch.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Is it okay? One more.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Actually, we should go. It makes it very
[2:31:00] simple. Is actually the last the last to
[2:31:05] a a condition to be rapture ready. a the
[2:31:08] right kind of um to be ready ready for
[2:31:12] the change. Well, it's very obvious when
[2:31:16] we look at what we know what will happen
[2:31:18] did not happen yet, which is the last
[2:31:21] rapture, the third one in the New
[2:31:23] Testament, which we understand the
[2:31:26] prophet said will be the two witnesses.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:31:31] Now, I want to I want to really get you
[2:31:33] to your get you to your toes and see
[2:31:39] what it means to be ready to be
[2:31:41] raptured.
[2:31:46] [snorts]
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; You know that those two witnesses
[2:31:52] will be killed.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Well, we we can we we don't have the
[2:31:57] time. Read Revelation 10 11 7-12. We
[2:32:00] don't read it. We don't read it. We
[2:32:01] don't have the time. Read at home and
[2:32:03] see what's happened to them. They do
[2:32:05] great signs and wonders and great things
[2:32:07] and everybody would say, "Yeah, those
[2:32:08] guys are ready for rapture." And now the
[2:32:10] system kills them.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Are they still ready for rapture?
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, NOT ONLY THAT, NOW HOW LONG DO THEY
[2:32:20] LAY DEAD IN THE STREET?
[2:32:22] WHAT DO YOU THINK of guys laying dead IN
[2:32:25] THE STREET, KILLED BY THE SYSTEM?
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Are they ready for rapture?
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. You understand?
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT
[2:32:38] MEANS TO BE READY BY ready for rapture.

[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody may say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You understand our our our own
[2:32:50] thinking about readiness
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; vanish away.
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Are they ready FOR RAPTURE?
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW BUT BUT
[2:33:01] THINK ALL THE world they make PRESENTS
[2:33:03] TO ONE ANOTHER. HE SAID YEAH THOSE
[2:33:05] TERRORISTS WE KILLED THEM FINALLY.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; UHHUH.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; And then they least three three days and
[2:33:12] and they nearly the bodies are nearly
[2:33:14] start shrinking and stinking.
[2:33:17] Rapture ready.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; to just keep the right attitude
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; in all the stuff.
[2:33:37] [clears throat]
[2:33:38] The second one that actually was was
[2:33:40] changed
[2:33:42] was and here here really where it linked
[2:33:45] up with me where is the one that was a
[2:33:48] man like passion.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; And you will be amazed what it means to
[2:33:54] be rapture ready.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; And I tell you when you see that Satan
[2:33:58] has lost.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; When you see that Satan has lost.
[2:34:05] Regardless how you feel, regardless how
[2:34:07] low you are,
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; has nothing to do with that.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just keep the attitude right.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Is that correct? Just keep the attitude
[2:34:20] right.
[2:34:22] [snorts]
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Uh first of first of all I want to say
[2:34:25] about Elijah.
[2:34:27] He was a man of many miracles.
[2:34:33] What? But was the amount of miracles
[2:34:36] a measure to be ready for rapture?
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Then Elisha had to be raptured.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Because he did double as much as Elijah.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Good.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Just really to to to get our things to
[2:34:54] the
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; you know you to the normal life.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Don't try to be magic.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:35:01] to be raptured. That's
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; I want to say again,
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; How many miracles did Elijah, you meant
[2:35:07] how you counts eight or 16. Elisha did
[2:35:10] more.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Double portion.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; So, it was not really to be raptured
[2:35:17] ready was not how many miracles happened
[2:35:20] in your life.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; WHY I SAY THAT? BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS
[2:35:30] WHERE SATAN many times gets us.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. No. The man actually
[2:35:39] that did double his miracles died with
[2:35:42] his sickness.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Right. That's the truth.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:47] [laughter]
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; My to me it's as I trust we can really
[2:35:52] get into it that it has an impact on us.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; So when Satan comes around,
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; right,
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; telling you, hey, you have no miracles
[2:36:01] in your life.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; And he's telling you the truth.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; You can say, "Get behind me."
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Would you take the courage to tell him?
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; The bride by now should know who she is,
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:36:24] This is not just a slogan.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is not just a slogan. Brother
[2:36:28] brother said not not only when the bride
[2:36:30] knows who she is but when the bride
[2:36:31] knows what it is
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; then the rapture will go.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; What is it? The grace of God.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; The next thing little bit about Elijah.
[2:36:42] Elijah it's uh you know that Elijah
[2:36:45] Elijah couldn't stop the death of Nabot.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; He couldn't stop
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; Nabot dying. Yeah.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Couldn't stop it.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on, church.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; He couldn't stop it.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; Rapture ready.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; He couldn't even stop Jezebel.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; So don't try to work against the system.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; How many people in CO sorry when I say
[2:37:18] that.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; How many people in CO were trying
[2:37:21] against the system? Yeah.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Don't be stupid.
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; Don't waste your breath.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what I told the people at
[2:37:28] home. Don't fight against the Jesus
[2:37:30] never was fighting against the system.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; I mean, he was there. He was there under
[2:37:35] under under uh Agria and under Caesar
[2:37:38] Augustus and the great guy THAT WANTED
[2:37:40] TO KILL HIM AND THEY asked him, "Shall
[2:37:41] we PAY TAX TO HIM?" He said, "Give to
[2:37:43] Caesars what is to him."
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; One day, one guy came out of the city
[2:37:49] said, "You know that you are in our
[2:37:50] hands." Yeah,
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; I think it was Pilate.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus said, "Unless it is
[2:37:56] given unto you, you can do nothing."
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:38:03] [snorts]
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; So Elijah
[2:38:06] didn't fight the system.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; You're with me?
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:14] [snorts]
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:18] further on
[2:38:20] uh we said we will close because I think
[2:38:22] it gets really too much. We could go to
[2:38:24] Jesus Christ. Now jump quickly in Jesus
[2:38:29] Christ
[2:38:33] when he was in Gethsemane
[2:38:36] when the spirit
[2:38:39] had left him.
[2:38:42] You think he was rapture ready?
[2:38:48] Mhm. Say what? Say it once again.
[2:38:52] When the spirit had left Jesus in
[2:38:54] Gethsemane, was he rapture ready?
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever happens to you according to
[2:39:06] your purpose
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; that God allows
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; doesn't matter. That's right. True.
[2:39:18] When he healed the sick, when he fed the
[2:39:21] 5,000,
[2:39:23] was he rapture ready? Oh yes, he proved
[2:39:25] it.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; When he WAS HANGING AT THE CROSS AND
[2:39:29] SAYING, "MY GOD, MY GOD." WAS HE RAPTURE
[2:39:31] READY?
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; In the garden, you know that he went
[2:39:39] three times.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; First time he said, "Lord, if that is
[2:39:46] take, if it's possible, take the cup
[2:39:48] away from me."
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Not mine will be done."
[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; He walked again.
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "If that is possible,
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; can you imagine? Take that cup away from
[2:39:59] me." But
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; showing his attitude,
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; "But on my will be done, but thy will be
[2:40:04] done." YEAH.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; THE THIRD TIME HE GOES BACK AND he said,
[2:40:06] "Lord, if it is possible, let this cup
[2:40:09] depart from me. But not my will be done,
[2:40:11] but thy will be done."
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Three times he went. Was he rapture
[2:40:16] ready?
[2:40:22] [snorts]
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; Turn back to Elijah.
[2:40:26] Let's
[2:40:27] um read with me quickly and and and
[2:40:30] then we are closing.
[2:40:33] Then we are closing. Yeah, this will be
[2:40:37] I want to read two scriptures in in
[2:40:39] Kings which which which is very was very
[2:40:42] eyeopening to me about Elijah the one
[2:40:46] who was rapture ready.
[2:40:49] And I trust that we can get a little not
[2:40:51] encouragement out of it but just
[2:40:53] understand that Elijah
[2:40:55] made mistakes in his life,
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; right? He made mistakes.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:41:02] And so we do mistakes.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; But was he rapture ready?
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; First Kings 19.
[2:41:19] First Kings 19. Let's quickly read that
[2:41:21] together. I trust you uh can bear with
[2:41:24] me
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; for that for the time because
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so beautiful
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; when stuff is around you
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; and when you find yourself in mistakes
[2:41:40] that you did.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; You cannot blame nobody else
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; too quick. We blame somebody else,
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; right? But in this you come to times you
[2:41:51] can only blame yourself,
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; But we shouldn't blame ourselves.
[2:42:00] Somebody can say amen to that.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; Keep the right attitude.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; If you do a mistake, say sorry Lord and
[2:42:08] go on.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:42:12] [snorts]
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; Chapter 19. And Ahab told Jezebel and
[2:42:15] all that Elijah had done and with all
[2:42:17] all his slain and all the prophets with
[2:42:19] the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger
[2:42:21] unto Elijah, saying, "So let the gods do
[2:42:23] unto me, and more also, if make not thy
[2:42:27] life as the life of one of them by
[2:42:29] tomorrow about this time." And when he
[2:42:31] saw that, he arose and went for his life
[2:42:34] and came to Bata with belonged to Judah,
[2:42:37] you know, and there he made his great
[2:42:39] mistake
[2:42:41] and he left his servant behind.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; This is a typical
[2:42:55] um manifestation
[2:42:57] when people are under depression.
[2:43:00] They want to be alone.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; There he made his mistake. He left his
[2:43:12] servant behind.
[2:43:15] So if you walk into a depression, don't
[2:43:18] stay alone.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; Come to church.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; And you know, but but Elijah was like
[2:43:28] passion,
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; right? Come on, CHURCH. HE WAS LIKE
[2:43:32] PASSION. And he was really coming into a
[2:43:35] deep depression. So deep.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; That he was sorry when I say that that
[2:43:41] he was suicidal.
[2:43:43] You said, "Lord, I tell ME I WANT TO
[2:43:45] DIE."
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; You know what God said?
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; Rest a little.
[2:43:57] &gt;&gt; God never said, "You should pray a
[2:43:59] little more."
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Rest.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; And by the way, here's something good to
[2:44:05] eat."
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Right. And as he was resting and eating,
[2:44:14] he came out of it.
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; He was a man. And now I ask you a
[2:44:25] question. Was he rapture ready?
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; We will we will go and we will don't
[2:44:31] read the scripture. I just want to you
[2:44:32] can you can go for yourself. 2 Kings 2
[2:44:34] chapter uh 2 4 and 6. 2 Kings 2 verse 2
[2:44:39] 4 and 6. That was finally Elijah's walk.
[2:44:43] Now listen very carefully. That was
[2:44:45] Elijah's walk into his change.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; So we can say the rapture, the change,
[2:44:54] the translation, right?
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; It was the journey.
[2:45:00] It was the journey actually from Gilgal
[2:45:04] to Beta to Jericho to the Jordan.
[2:45:08] Watch Enoch. Uh watch watch Elijah on
[2:45:11] his way to be raptured
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; as they came to the first place of the
[2:45:18] journey
[2:45:20] which was uh Gilgal. You know what he
[2:45:23] said to Elijah?
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; Stay here.
[2:45:27] You know why? This is what people do
[2:45:29] when they are under depression.
[2:45:34] He said to Elisha,
[2:45:36] "Stay here." And Elisha said no.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Come on church.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; They came to the next place. Very
[2:45:49] amazing. To Betel. You know what he said
[2:45:51] again in Betel to Elisha? Stay here.
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; A typical sign of someone that is under
[2:45:57] depression. He wants to be alone.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; What did Elisha said? No.
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Yeah.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready?
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; So that means when stuff is around you
[2:46:16] has nothing to do when you fall into
[2:46:18] your deepest ditch. When you fall into
[2:46:19] your deepest depression has nothing to
[2:46:21] do with rapture ready.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; He came to the next. He came to finally
[2:46:33] to to Jericho. The same story. Same
[2:46:35] story always. All the time Elijah is
[2:46:38] trying to be alone. He said to Elijah,
[2:46:40] "Stay here." And Elisha said, "No."
[2:46:44] Elijah knew exactly what is the best for
[2:46:46] Elijah.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; When a man is in depression, don't leave
[2:46:50] him alone.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. AND HE WAS WALKING IN
[2:46:55] HIS mood
[2:47:00] and
[2:47:02] a chariot came.
[2:47:08] Can you see the story? A chariot came.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; And here Elijah and Elisha were talking.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; If I would be Elijah, I would jump in.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; You understand? [laughter]
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; HERE, DAILY ROUTINE. COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; HERE COMES THE SUPERNATURAL. I MEAN, A
[2:47:28] CHARIOT of fire.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; And here he's taking up Elisha. And by
[2:47:32] the way, AND ELIJAH, HEY, YOUR MANTLE.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; Are we rapture ready?
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Who is rapture ready?
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; Ah, there's much more hands now up.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand how simple it is?
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; This is was just on my heart. Because
[2:48:02] Satan is fooling too much with us.
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus was raptured.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; No, it's too late. It's too late. There
[2:48:15] was the one of the matter factors.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hanging at the cross.
[2:48:25] Just showing the right attitude.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Just that. Yes.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; Couldn't be baptized anymore.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; And Jesus told him, "Today you will be
[2:48:38] with me in paradise."
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; But you know that guy didn't stay long.
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; He was raptured.
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; As he walked into paradise, he could
[2:48:50] say, "It's time, friends."
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; Was he raptured?
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; Was he THE ONE THAT APPEARED TO MANY in
[2:48:59] Jerusalem? Praise God.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Just the right attitude.
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let us stand to our feet.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sorry I have to leave you a
[2:49:15] little bit in between, but uh I trust
[2:49:21] I trust we are encouraged.
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; When stuff is around us,
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; don't worry. Praise
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:35] Oh, who want to who want to say thank
[2:49:36] you Lord?
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry when I saw that it helped me.
[2:49:41] I cannot cannot do different. I said
[2:49:43] praise the Lord. I said my goodness
[2:49:45] there's hope for me.
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you really the preacher,
[2:49:49] you know how many times he has really a
[2:49:51] low I mean it was it was it WAS JOB
[2:49:54] SAYING CURSE ME THE DAY that I was born.
[2:49:57] You know how many times a minister has
[2:49:58] that?
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; You know how many times brother Random
[2:50:03] had it?
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. YOU KNOW HOW BAD HE HAD
[2:50:06] IT?
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, [snorts] sir.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready?
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my. Can we give the Lord a hand
[2:50:18] of praise? Amen.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; Not not because you understand that
[2:50:22] [applause]
[2:50:26] just to show him [applause] just to show
[2:50:29] him. Lord, we have appreciate. I don't
[2:50:31] know why I'm clapping, but I'm
[2:50:32] appreciating what you have done.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; it's later than we think.
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; Bride is ready now.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the bride is ready? Thank
[2:50:46] you, Lord.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; All things are ready now.
[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; All things are ready now.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; Do we want to give Do you want Do we
[2:50:59] want to tell him together that we love
[2:51:00] him?
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:05] &gt;&gt; Why not raise our hands?
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; And don't wait. Don't wait for the one
[2:51:11] here in the front to pray for you.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; You pray yourself. Amen.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; It will be your rapture. It will be your
[2:51:16] body changed.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; It is your union.
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; God is interested in you personally.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; All of the raptures
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; never was a family affair.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; Never was a church affair.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; God is interested in you personally.
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heavenly Father,
[2:51:42] Lord is such a great privilege of what
[2:51:44] we have come to
[2:51:47] Father and we stand in awe
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; within your presence.
[2:51:53] [snorts] Understanding what you have
[2:51:54] done in our age, understanding what you
[2:51:56] have done in our time, understanding
[2:51:59] what has happened since the prophet has
[2:52:01] left the scene and how the bride of the
[2:52:04] true church will be the final voice
[2:52:07] under her messenger.
[2:52:10] And that messenger is no one else than
[2:52:12] Jesus Christ.
[2:52:15] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you. We so much
[2:52:17] appreciate you. We thank you for all the
[2:52:20] things that you have done. We thank you
[2:52:22] for your grace and for your mercy,
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; Father. And as we walk from here,
[2:52:28] [snorts] may we may we help us that we
[2:52:32] can easier and quicker discern when the
[2:52:35] enemy is coming.
[2:52:39] and how difficult the time becomes.
[2:52:43] May we always keep the right attitude
[2:52:48] [snorts] and saying amen to the word.
[2:52:51] That was all that was for Eddie Wright.
[2:52:54] That was all that was for the woman in
[2:52:56] the Bible. When she said the right
[2:52:59] thing,
[2:53:01] you did what only you could do. And
[2:53:04] Father, this afternoon, we just want to
[2:53:06] say the right thing. We want to say amen
[2:53:09] to your word. What you have said about
[2:53:11] us is nothing but the truth.
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; We love you and we appreciate you so
[2:53:17] much. And as as we really are feeling,
[2:53:21] we are standing we are standing in awe
[2:53:25] within this great presence.
[2:53:28] Father, you have done it well.
[2:53:32] You have done it well and we want to
[2:53:34] thank you for that. May you bless this
[2:53:37] church. May you bless the ministry.
[2:53:39] [music] May you bless each and everyone
[2:53:40] that we can grasp what has happened in
[2:53:43] our day.
[2:53:46] Anoint our eyes.
[2:53:48] Anoint our hearts
[2:53:50] that we can serve thee better. [music]
[2:53:54] Not maybe not in more works or in some
[2:53:57] kind of expression [music] but just in
[2:54:00] an simple attitude.
[2:54:03] As Mary would say, it be to me according
[2:54:06] to your word. [music] We love you,
[2:54:08] Father. We appreciate so much. May you
[2:54:11] receive all the honor and the glory.
[2:54:13] Father, I see that there is an awareness
[2:54:17] and in
[2:54:18] people are in awe. If this is the truth,
[2:54:23] [music]
[2:54:24] it sounds so unusual.
[2:54:27] This is what it did to Mary. It sounded
[2:54:29] so unusual,
[2:54:31] but it was the truth.
[2:54:34] Help us to believe it. Help us to
[2:54:36] receive it. We ask it in your name. In
[2:54:38] Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen.
[2:54:41] Hallelujah. Be it unto me. [music] Let's
[2:54:43] sing the Can we sing the song? Be it
[2:54:44] unto me.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sorry for keeping you so
[2:54:47] long. Amen. [singing]
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; According [music]
[2:54:51] to your words.
[2:54:55] According [singing] to [music]
[2:54:58] your promise
[2:55:02] I can stand [singing]
[2:55:05] [music] you
[2:55:08] cover upon [singing] my heart.
[2:55:13] The truth that sets me free [music]
[2:55:19] according [singing] to your [music]
[2:55:22] word. Oh,
[2:55:25] be [singing] it unto [music] me.
[2:55:31] Be [singing] it unto me. [music]
[2:55:36] According [singing]
[2:55:38] to your word,
[2:55:42] according [music and singing] to your
[2:55:45] promises,
[2:55:48] I can [music and singing] stand secure.
[2:55:54] Guard upon [music and singing] my heart
[2:55:59] the truth that sets [singing]
[2:56:02] me free
[2:56:05] according [singing] to [music]
[2:56:07] your word.
[2:56:11] Lead it [singing] unto me. [music]
[2:56:18] Amen. How simple. Let's just [music]
[2:56:21] agree with the word.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I liked what he said about Mary.
[2:56:27] Mary
[2:56:29] Sarah looked at herself
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; in discouragement. [music]
[2:56:34] Sarah had already tried to bring about
[2:56:36] the promise and she failed.
[2:56:38] When [music] she was young and able, it
[2:56:40] didn't work. And she tried with her own
[2:56:42] reasoning to come up with a plan with
[2:56:44] Hagar, and it didn't work. And she
[2:56:46] finally threw in the towel. This isn't
[2:56:49] going to work for me. I'm too old.
[2:56:50] doesn't work. Amen. But it was for her
[2:56:53] anyhow.
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; When it comes to Mary, Mary looks at
[2:56:57] herself. She can't do it either. How can
[2:56:59] I do [music] this knowing not a man?
[2:57:00] She's just as incapable. And and and
[2:57:04] [clears throat] the answer is no more
[2:57:05] scientific than anything. The Holy Ghost
[2:57:08] will overshadow you.
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; But something inside of her said,
[2:57:12] [music] "Whatever you say, it's the
[2:57:14] truth.
[2:57:15] &gt;&gt; I received the promise."
[2:57:18] When it comes to a body change, I love
[2:57:20] that. What What are we going to do?
[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; What am I going to do?
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; Am I going to strain hard and try hard
[2:57:28] and pop my atoms into changing? It's got
[2:57:31] to be his promise made manifest. It's
[2:57:34] got to be something he does in me.
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; And I said, God, let me just [music]
[2:57:39] say, be it unto me.
[2:57:42] Amen.
[2:57:43] I love that
[2:57:46] marriage is a taking. I ask you a
[2:57:48] question. Has he taken you
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; to himself? Taken you from what you were
[2:57:53] and brought you into another position?
[2:57:55] Amen. Let's walk in that position and
[2:57:57] believe what he's brought us into. He's
[2:57:59] already taken me [music] to himself.
[2:58:00] He's already taken me out of Leodysia.
[2:58:03] He's already brought me into a union
[2:58:04] with him. And that union with him is
[2:58:06] going to produce everything that it's
[2:58:08] supposed to produce. And one day, these
[2:58:11] atoms are going to change.
[2:58:13] But
[2:58:13] &gt;&gt; until then, I'm just going to enjoy him
[2:58:15] taking me.
[2:58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; And enjoy the walk with the Lord.
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; I I believe like the brother said, it's
[2:58:24] [music] going to be easy.
[2:58:26] That the the change of Adams is not
[2:58:28] going to be hard. [music] It's going to
[2:58:31] be the common fair of life. It's just
[2:58:33] going to happen.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to be a revelation.
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; And God's the one who controls
[2:58:40] revelation.
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I just want to keep saying,
[2:58:45] God, I believe it.
[2:58:47] &gt;&gt; I believe it, Lord. I'm not looking at
[2:58:50] my abilities or my inabilities. I've got
[2:58:52] a whole lot of inabilities. I'm not
[2:58:54] looking at my status in life. I'm not
[2:58:56] looking at all my failures, but I'm
[2:58:57] looking at your promise, [music] and I'm
[2:58:58] saying, I believe it, and I believe what
[2:59:00] you said about me, and I believe who I
[2:59:02] am because you identified me.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; I didn't call myself. You called me
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; and I believe it.
[2:59:09] [music]
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's grateful?
[2:59:12] So grateful to be walking in this
[2:59:15] mystery revelation. Let's bow our heads
[2:59:17] together and just thank God for this
[2:59:19] word. Lord Jesus,
[2:59:21] I'm so thankful, God, for the revelation
[2:59:23] of your word. [music]
[2:59:25] And God, my mind can't put it all
[2:59:28] together. And I can't comprehend
[2:59:30] all that you're doing, Lord, but there's
[2:59:32] something in me that's saying, "Be
[2:59:34] [music] it unto me, Lord. I receive it
[2:59:36] by faith." I believe, Lord, that it's me
[2:59:38] that you're talking about. God, I'm no
[2:59:41] more worthy than anyone else, but God, I
[2:59:44] believe when you called me, you called
[2:59:46] my name. I heard my name in the
[2:59:48] preaching of the word, and I'm
[2:59:49] identified [music] in this message.
[2:59:52] And God, I believe when you came in an
[2:59:54] invisible union, I'm part of that union,
[2:59:56] Lord. You took me to yourself, Lord, and
[2:59:59] now I'm walking with you in a special
[3:00:01] relationship.
[3:00:03] It's something completely different. I'm
[3:00:05] separated from the world. I'm reserved
[3:00:07] only unto you. I'm hidden away from the
[3:00:09] world in many ways because of my union
[3:00:12] with you.
[3:00:14] And God, I just want to keep believing
[3:00:17] no matter what happens in the
[3:00:18] circumstances. Lord, as you came and
[3:00:21] preached through our brother, the stuff
[3:00:23] cannot change the truth. The
[3:00:25] circumstances cannot change what you've
[3:00:28] done and what you're doing.
[3:00:30] But God, may it all work together for
[3:00:33] your glory. And may every circumstance
[3:00:35] we find ourselves in, whether a good day
[3:00:38] or a bad day, with success or failure,
[3:00:41] with regardless of the circumstances,
[3:00:43] may we recognize we're walking in a
[3:00:45] peculiar place. For we are separated
[3:00:48] unto you and we're here for your glory
[3:00:51] and you're sounding, Lord, a voice
[3:00:53] through our lives.
[3:00:55] And God, you're finishing the promise in
[3:00:58] us. And you will complete it. You will
[3:01:01] bring it to completion, Lord. And I
[3:01:03] believe it, Father.
[3:01:05] God, I ask that you would bless us,
[3:01:07] Lord, as we walk out of here. May those
[3:01:09] things not fade away because, God, I
[3:01:11] know that we're going to encounter more
[3:01:12] stuff, more bad days, more discouraging
[3:01:15] things. But may it not phase us, Lord.
[3:01:17] May we realize the reality that we're
[3:01:19] walking in the truth of this word being
[3:01:22] real to us. [music] May we continue lift
[3:01:25] our hands and say, "Lord, I believe your
[3:01:28] word. I believe what you said about me.
[3:01:31] And thank you, Father. [music] Have your
[3:01:33] way in the midst of the stuff and the
[3:01:35] circumstances. Prove yourself once again
[3:01:38] mighty on my behalf. God, give us the
[3:01:41] courage to keep walking, keep
[3:01:43] expressing, that we keep living. And
[3:01:45] Lord, let our joy would remain for we
[3:01:47] understand the position we're in.
[3:01:49] [music]
[3:01:50] And God, we pray for our brother Andreas
[3:01:52] that you would continue to strengthen
[3:01:54] him and bless him for the work you have
[3:01:56] for our brother. [music] Thank you for
[3:01:57] bringing him our way and using him as a
[3:01:59] tool in your hand. And now may you
[3:02:01] refresh him and strengthen him for
[3:02:03] further service. And God, may we walk
[3:02:06] out of here. May we be strengthened and
[3:02:08] refreshed for further service for this
[3:02:11] life that we live. May it be [music] for
[3:02:13] your glory. Well, we love you. We ask
[3:02:16] for all these things in your precious
[3:02:18] name in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:02:20] Christ.
[3:02:21] Amen.
[3:02:24] Amen. Be unto me [singing]
[3:02:30] according to [music]
[3:02:33] your word,
[3:02:36] according [singing] to [music]
[3:02:38] your promises.
[3:02:42] I [singing] can stand [music] secure.
[3:02:48] Carve above my heart [singing]
[3:02:52] the truth [music] that sets me free.
[3:02:58] According to [singing and music] your
[3:03:01] word, oh
[3:03:07] me. [music]
[3:03:10] It was a tiny [singing] simple stable
[3:03:15] all beaten [music]
[3:03:17] and warm.
[3:03:20] Hardly
[3:03:22] a [singing and music] place
[3:03:24] for a king to behold.
[3:03:28] He didn't [music and singing] choose
[3:03:30] something special
[3:03:33] to reveal his majesty.
[3:03:37] Though [singing] I know [music] if I
[3:03:40] give control,
[3:03:42] he'll be born [singing]
[3:03:44] in [music] me.
[3:03:48] Let [singing] your word
[3:03:51] be born
[3:03:53] in the manger [music and singing] of my
[3:03:56] heart.
[3:03:58] Let it live in me. [music]
[3:04:02] [singing] Let it start.
[3:04:07] Live inside this [music and singing]
[3:04:09] house of clay
[3:04:12] and mold it every [music]
[3:04:14] day.
[3:04:17] Let your [singing] word be born
[3:04:21] in the manger [music]
[3:04:23] of my [singing] heart.
[3:04:30] Outwardly [music]
[3:04:32] [singing] I'm nothing,
[3:04:34] not much to behold,
[3:04:38] [singing] unlikely [music]
[3:04:41] a place
[3:04:43] for his word [singing] to unfold.
[3:04:47] But [music] if I just yield this
[3:04:49] [singing] vessel
[3:04:52] and let him have [music] his way
[3:04:56] from glory on [singing] to glory,
[3:05:00] he'll [music] change me day by day.
[3:05:06] Let [music] your word
[3:05:09] be born [singing]
[3:05:11] in the manger [music] of my heart.
[3:05:16] Let it [singing] live [music] in me. Let
[3:05:20] it
[3:05:23] [singing]
[3:05:24] [music] live inside this house of
[3:05:29] moldy [singing] day [music] by day.
[3:05:34] Let your word be [music]
[3:05:38] in the manger [singing]
[3:05:40] of [music] my heart. Outwardly.
[3:05:47] Outwardly [music and singing]
[3:05:49] and nothing.
[3:05:51] Not much to behold.
[3:05:55] Unlikely [music and singing]
[3:05:57] the place
[3:05:59] for his word to [singing] unfold.
[3:06:04] But if I [music] just yield this vessel
[3:06:07] [singing]
[3:06:08] and let him have his way
[3:06:12] from [music] glory [singing]
[3:06:14] onto glory,
[3:06:17] you'll change me day [singing] by day.
[3:06:20] [music]
[3:06:22] Let your word
[3:06:25] be born [singing]
[3:06:27] [music] in the manger of my heart.
[3:06:32] Let it [singing] live [music] in me. Let
[3:06:36] it start.
[3:06:39] [singing]
[3:06:40] [music] Live inside this house of clay
[3:06:45] and holy [singing]
[3:06:46] day by day. [music]
[3:06:49] Let your word be born
[3:06:53] in the manger [music and singing]
[3:06:56] of my heart. Let your word,
[3:07:01] [music] let [singing] your word
[3:07:04] be born
[3:07:06] in the manger [singing]
[3:07:08] of [music] my heart.
[3:07:11] Let it live in me.
[3:07:15] [music and singing]
[3:07:17] Let it start
[3:07:19] live inside [music] this house of clay.
[3:07:24] Holy [singing]
[3:07:26] day.
[3:07:28] Let your [music] word be born
[3:07:32] in [singing] the manger
[3:07:35] of [music]
[3:07:37] my heart.
[3:07:39] [singing]
