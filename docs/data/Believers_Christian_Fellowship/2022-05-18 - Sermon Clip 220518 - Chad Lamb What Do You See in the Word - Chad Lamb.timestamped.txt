[0:00] this little boy all he had was a piece
[0:01] of broken mirror you know how broken
[0:03] mirror is you know it's not steady on
[0:05] the edges and so it's a little
[0:06] distorting the edges maybe a crack
[0:08] running through it if you want to comb
[0:09] your hair you kind of have to move your
[0:10] head you can't even see you can only see
[0:13] so much of yourself you probably can't
[0:15] even see your whole hairline amen until
[0:17] you move your head a little bit and make
[0:19] sure that the left and the right side is
[0:21] okay all right we're okay and we move on
[0:23] if a little boy wanted to see anything
[0:25] he had to get a box and climb up and
[0:27] just peek up into it and he might see a
[0:29] little bit of his face or all of his
[0:30] face who knows how much amen but but
[0:33] this little boy who can only see so much
[0:36] of himself listen that little broken
[0:38] mirror is denominational traditional
[0:41] ideas it's only a little view of the
[0:43] word amen luther had a little view of
[0:45] the word wesley had a little view of the
[0:47] word pentecost had a little view of the
[0:49] word why because the nomination that
[0:51] came and broke up the word
[0:53] and they each grabbed a piece of broken
[0:55] mirror and they could only see a little
[0:57] bit in this mirror but this little boy
[0:59] when he went on a journey amen he come
[1:02] to a place that had a complete mirror
[1:04] and i want to tell you that there's a
[1:06] complete mirror that's been restored at
[1:08] the end of the ages this message has
[1:10] brought a complete full length perfect
[1:13] mirror no cracks no missing pieces amen
[1:16] it's all been put back together and made
[1:18] perfect and i'll tell you what else this
[1:20] mirror is not distorted
[1:23] it's not bent on the edges it's not
[1:25] twisted it's not flex amen it doesn't
[1:27] give you back a funny view of yourself
[1:29] you know if somebody takes the word and
[1:30] they bend it and they take this mirror
[1:32] and they bend it amen you'll get an odd
[1:35] reflection of yourself and you'll walk
[1:36] away horrified
[1:38] because you're three foot tall and 500
[1:40] pounds
[1:45] that's what man does to the word
[1:48] and when you look into man's broken
[1:50] piece of the word in man's distorted
[1:52] word amen it always gives you the wrong
[1:54] picture of yourself
[1:57] you either can't see all of yourself or
[1:59] what you see is twisted up and distorted
[2:01] until you walk away with the wrong view
[2:03] of who you are
[2:07] but in this day we've got a complete
[2:09] mirror a perfect mirror a perfect word
[2:12] by god's grace we have a perfect
[2:14] interpretation of the word with divine
[2:15] vindication the word has been restored
[2:17] and now you can stand in front of that
[2:19] mirror and know what god's idea was of
[2:21] you before the foundation of the world
[2:23] how he wants you to live how he wants
[2:25] you to dress how he wants you to speak
[2:27] how he wants you to talk what the
[2:28] reflection of jesus christ in a female
[2:31] form should look like because the word
[2:33] has been restored
[2:34] and when you look in that you see
[2:36] yourself the way god wants you to look
[2:39] the way god sees you and when you see
[2:41] that you can be changed into that image
[2:44] from glory and to glory
[2:46] by the spirit of the lord
[2:48] not by might not by power but by my
[2:52] spirit but you'll never be changed into
[2:54] that image until you get in front of the
[2:57] mirror
[2:58] the full mirror
