friday and saturday this week because of the rehearsal and because of the wedding and also brother emanuel is going to take the service for us on wednesday to give me a little breather amen so i really appreciate that and brother stephen coffey is going to take the sunday service so be praying for these brothers and we're very much looking forward to that and we appreciate your prayers man let's look at romans chapter 1 and verse 16. romans 1 and 16 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith you can all have your seeds i would like to take a little bit of time as the lord wills this morning and speak on the greatest sense which we know is faith or the sixth sense but the greatest sense and brother brim says and why it had to be shepherds from 1964 he says now that same thing was here when adam was here television was here when elijah sat on mount carmel it was here when martin luther that young priest throw the communion on the floor and said it's kosher and the just shall live by faith it was here then but we are just now finding him and it's also so that in our presence tonight is god angels supernatural beings that's unseen to our natural sense of sight but someday it will be a reality just as television is now and just as common now that is why i believe the word brother branham is now he's he's looking beyond this dimension and he's he's using a type of of a scientific discovery of television and said the television was here back then amen because the light waves were here the light waves that went out were here they just found a way to collect it transmit it and and re reposition it or redisplay it but it was already here and he says so is also god is here the angels are here supernatural beings are here in one day it'll be just as common as television is now he says it again in who is this melchizedek it says a theophany is something that you could not see it could be right here now yet you cannot see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension television people are moving right through this room now singing there is colors also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to five senses rather and you are only subject to what the site has been limited to see i love that you're you're you're subject to what the site has been limited to see that means this site is limited and if this site is limited i would not put a whole lot of value or stock in a sense that is limited amen so let's let's keep going he says your whole being is only subject to the senses rather and you are only subject to what the site has been limited to see but there is another dimension that can be seen by a transformation by television now television does not manufacture a picture television only channels it into a circuit and then the television screen picks it up but the picture is there to begin with television was here when adam was here television was here when elijah said on mount carmel television was here when jesus of nazareth walked the shores of galilee but you're just now discovering it they would they wouldn't have believed it back there you'd have been crazy to have said something like it but now it's become a reality so in that day years ago if you would have tried to explain television collect a picture transpire transfer it wirelessly and to a receiver pick it up and show the same picture that happened thousands of miles away show it again they would have thought you were crazy but now it's just become common and they're spiritual things that for generations have been considered crazy there are understandings that we have revelations that have come to us in this day of who we are and our position in christ and what's going on all around us then in previous days they would have thought you were crazy to talk that way amen but now we know it to be a reality amen it becomes common to us not by eyesight these i see but the see the seeing that comes from the great sense of faith allows us to see beyond the limitation of the eyes he says it goes on to say but you were just now discovering it they wouldn't have believed it back there you'd have been crazy to have said something like that but now it's become reality and so it so is it that christ is here the angels of god are here and someday in the great millennium to come it'll be just more real than television or anything else because they are here he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he morphs himself into his servants and proves himself i want to read that again he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed he's revealing himself in his great form of what he claimed what did he claim he claimed a bride and now he's revealing himself in the great form of what he claimed as he enmorphs himself into his servants and proves himself so god is here amen where is he amen he's moving himself into what he's claimed he's in morphing himself into his servants and proves himself amen second corinthians 5 7 says before we walk by faith not by sight i'm going to read several quotes here out of 1959 and 1960 when brother venom speaking on this subject he says in the subject and the message door to the heart says you was given five senses but then five senses your intellectuals will never were was never given to you to lead you the sixth sense which is faith was given to you to lead you that's the sixth sense that's the super sense it leads you so now you find out when you come in contact with god that you've been under the wrong leadership all your life because you've been under the leadership of the senses of this flesh and the senses of the spirit amen but really the sense that god gave to lead us was the sixth sense in 1961 he says thou son of david have mercy on me in that message he says the sixth sense will defy any of the other five we do with with with the fives all right as long as they agree with the six and when they understand that the five senses the other senses are all right as long as they agree with the sixth sense when they disagree that's when they're not all right amen so it doesn't mean that everything the senses declare all wrong no if they align with the sixth sense that's fine but men wasn't given to live by the five senses to let the five senses guide him he was given prone to born here to be led by the sixth sense that's what god gave him the sixth sense for that's god's place in the heart to lead us so we're led by the sixth sense if we'll just let it now if the sixth sense says the word is wrong then you're not in the sixth sense that's the five senses but sixth sense will believe things that the five senses doesn't declare it's kind of complicated but it's true that's the sixth sense is what we're guided by and brother branham is talking about the sixth sense he's not talking about the eleventh sense amen because we know amen that we have brother bam says your three bodies you're a flesh body your spirit and your soul amen and that flesh body has five senses amen the spirit body has five senses but in the soul amen there's one sense that governs the soul the believers and that's faith if you don't have faith you have doubt or unbelief amen but what's governing the believer is faith in the soul and that's the sixth sense that trumps the five in the spirit that trumps the five in the flesh amen whatever whatever they're saying amen amen if they align and agree with the sixth sense they're fine if they're not agreeing with the sixth sense which always agrees with the word then those senses are wrong and to be ignored praise be to god let's go to john chapter 6. so you know brother makes this statement he says you know he's in a meeting says angels are lining the walls of this auditorium and if your eyes do not declare angels lining the walls of the auditorium then it's your eyesight that's wrong not brother branham it's your eyesight that's limited it's your eyesight that's failing to give you the revelation of the true reality that's all around us you have to remember the what we call reality is the vapor is the mist amen is the is the negative amen it's not the real reality it's the shadow off the real reality and we've been trained all our lives to believe that this is the reality this is the physical and we're missing the whole point that this is not the most physical this is not the reality this is the reflection of the reality or the shadow or the negative of the reality and so when we're limited by the senses we have to have something that will break us out of this norm that we've learned as a norm in our lives and move us into the real reality and that thing has been given to the children of god and awakened by the spirit of god and that thing is the sixth sense of faith that says there's angels lining the walls of this auditorium amen it doesn't matter if i could go over and touch them or not touch them it doesn't matter if i get a sensation up and down my arm or it makes my hair stand up or not stand up or i can see it or there's a shadow or a light that doesn't matter amen because what matters is the true reality that it's here and there's something in me that says it's here i know it's here i believe it's here no none of my senses will declare it's here it's here nonetheless that's the sense that god gave to guide us not the five in john chapter 6 53 he says then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it now if you think about these disciples these disciples had seen many things seen many miracles they had heard many teachings they had heard things jesus had said they had seen things jesus had done amen and by seeing and by hearing they were believing but it wasn't the sixth sense faith it was an intellectual faith and intellectual believing based off what they saw and based off what they heard so so you can see by their reaction to what jesus says that they did not have the sixth sense of faith amen that their soul was still stuck in unbelief amen although they thought that they were believers amen when the word test came they found out that they were not really believers they were intellectual believing based off the senses and any faith based off the senses is subject to fail and will fail it will eventually at some point meet a failure amen because there has to be the sixth sense amen that goes without amen without any of the other senses so jesus begins to shave down his crowd and he begins to test him with the word and he says i unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you and brother baby explains it so many times he says he didn't explain it he just said it amen because he was wanting to find where who was the children of god where were the elect amen because the non-elect all they have is the senses to go by and when they when they have the intellect and reasoning and understanding and they said it's impossible how are we going to eat his flesh and how are we going to drink his blood amen and jesus was using good language i mean he was using common language brother ben said he spoke in the common language the common people understood him heard him gladly so he was speaking in common language and when he said eat my flesh and drink my blood it was common words common words that they'd understand words that they had heard words that they thought they knew the meaning to by intellect and by reasoning by knowledge by understanding amen but he they missed amen they missed what he was saying by understanding the words that he was saying because they had intel and intellect and they had reasoning their intellect and reasoning could take words that were spoken their language attached definitions that they were taught in school come up to a conclusion that would be impossible and then they would turn and walk away but then you had a group of elect sitting there they heard the same words they had been taught the same definitions they had the same vocabulary amen they had maybe memorized the same spelling words in school and read it from the dictionary they had the same intellectual understanding they had the same reasoning they had the same kind of eyes and the same kind of ears in the flesh that the disciples who walked away amen but there was something in them that went deeper than the intellect they went deeper than the reasoning that went deeper than the physical eyes and physical ears for when it made no sense to any of the senses at all how we are going to eat this man's flesh and drink this man's blood something in them could not go amen and when jesus pressed him he said well you go also and peter says where shall we go thou alone have the words of eternal life and peter no more understood the statement than those that walked away but he wasn't to be led by his senses there was a sixth sense laying in the soul that was to be the leader man was supposed to be led by that amen and for years you know we've heard things that the prophet said that don't make sense intellectually amen and people are taken by intellectual reasoning words and definitions of words and timelines and dates and being able to look at a calendar and they've been able to come up with all kinds of discrepancies and heirs and what they call lies but there's another sense in me amen that doesn't tell time by a calendar amen that doesn't matter about a date amen is not interested in the definition of the word because i've caught the meaning that's behind the word praise be to god because there's got to be a sixth sense that leads the children of god and if god amen in the form of jesus christ would give statements amen to shave off to say it intentionally to cause something to walk away why would he do it different in this day when he sends malachi 4. when we have a son of man revealing the son of man the ministry of the son of man replicated on earth again why would he do it differently he's going to do it the same way amen because he's looking for his lost sheep he's looking for the sixth sense he's looking for somebody that can believe when their intelligence and their intellect says i do not know what he's talking about i cannot make it add up but i believe anyhow i believe anyhow and by god's grace by god's grace when they just stuck with what their what the sixth sense was telling them was truth with no understanding later the lord will come and bring a revelation and bring the proper understanding of what he said when you eat my flesh and drink my blood jesus was speaking amen to people with a a human beings with a human mind with human intellect and human eyes and ears and they had understanding on what eating means but they didn't know what he meant by eating they had an understanding what drinking meant but they didn't know what he meant by drinking because although he was speaking in natural terms he was speaking on a spiritual level and he tells him he says my my flesh is meat indeed it is food you can eat my flesh you think they understood it no they didn't understand it but they knew it was the truth if that man who i know is the son of god if he said my flesh is meat and deed that you can't actually eat my flesh then something in me is going to say that's nothing but the truth turn to the next disciple explain that to me i don't know how to explain it all i know is that he has the words of eternal life then god amen would open the eyes of his disciples lift him on a higher plane so that they realize the eating that he's talking about is not with your teeth not biting and chewing and swallowing amen that's not the eating he's talking about he's talking about partaking amen of that flesh which is the word made flesh taking the word feeding on the word becoming one with the word taking the word to the inside that's the eating that he's talking about when he says eat my flesh he's saying you can my flesh is meat and deed what is his flesh it was the word that was made flesh it was the manifested word for that day for that hour that they were living it was the word that had come forth and made manifest in that day and he says it is food and you can eat it well i'd like to say he has come forth in this day he is a manifested word in this day the word is made flesh and you can take it and you can eat it amen and there was a blood that you could drink and they knew the common understanding of that term they didn't understand what he meant or how it would work but they just stuck with it until he brought the revelation that his blood represents his life his spirit and you can drink of that spirit and receive it on the inside you can eat of that flesh that word and take of that life that spirit and you can become one with him and he can dwell in you and you can dwell in him see when jesus was here on earth speaking he was in a human form using language they understood but he was speaking on a whole different level and there's no way i'm telling your friends there's no way ever through the senses to understand what he was saying now that he's brought revelation and there's been bible schools and teaching and doctrines amen now people are able to take what jesus said and break it down and begin to show later in the bible the communion came in what jesus said at the last supper and what paul the apostle paul said in communion we can tie it all together and we can put it together in language that's comprehendable and a package that's easily seen with the eye and understood with the mind and you can get people to acknowledge oh eating his flesh is feeding on the word and drinking his blood is taking a spirit oh i get it i recognize it that's still not seeing it if you see it with the intellect you don't see it i'll say it this way if you understand it with the intellect alone you don't understand it if you see it with the eye alone you don't see it if you hear it with the ear alone you don't hear it for instance jesus he was doing miracles all kinds of miracles amen and they saw the miracles and you could you could see the crowd amen excited and rejoicing because the dead was raised the death could hear the blind eyes were open he fed the multitudes he did what no man could do amen and they testified this is god god's working in that man amen but but when he came to start speaking his doctrine when it came time for the crucifixion they all walked away and didn't believe anymore that means when they they saw you could go to somebody in that crowd you say did you see him raise that dead man i saw it do you believe he raised the dead man yes do you believe it was god in him yes did you see him feed the multitudes did you see when he tore off bread and more came did you see i saw it with my own eyes i was close enough i could see the bread come back do you believe he did it yes do you believe it was god yes but that's not the kind of believing that god's looking for for when that man's ministry began to tank and the crowds walked away and the pharisees began rejecting him amen and some of his own disciples walked away and then he become then he was arrested by the by the by the high priest and turned over to the romans and he was going to be crucified where were all the believers then because they only believed what they saw they only believed what they heard they only believed what they understood i mean there was no sixth sense to take them to a true faith to a true belief because they believed that when the sight changed and the hearing changed and the understanding changed their faith went away that's not the sixth sense faith that's a human faith that's an intellectual faith and that's the faith that fluctuates with the eyes with the ears with the mind amen but there's got to be another faith in his children that doesn't fluctuate with the sight amen doesn't fluctuate with the ears and doesn't fluctuate with the mind your mind will go up and down your emotions will go up and down and you can't stop that movement sometimes amen and your eyes will see things that will cause your intellect to waver but god's not interested in your intellect he's interested in that faith seed and although the mind may waver and bounce here and get discouraged and come back and misunderstand and then understand god's not interested in what's going on in the five senses he's interested in the six tens and that sixth sense will hold no matter how much the mind wavers it'll bounce all over the place like a ship bobbing in the ocean but there's an anchor that goes down into the soul and hooks to the rock of revelation with the sixth sense and it doesn't matter what's bobbing in the storm out here something true is taking place down below and holding you that's the sense that is to guide us that's the one that he's looking for brother man says 1956 when their eyes were open now what is faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you do not see taste feel smell here i want to ask you are there angels lining the walls of this room do you believe it because i told you do you believe it because you heard it do you believe it because brother branham said it or do you believe because something in you says it's the truth it's just the truth amen see you believe it your body has five senses none of them senses contact god so important he said you believe it your body has five senses none of them senses contact god god gives you them five senses to contact your earthly home here on earth but you contact god by faith see sometimes we make the mistake in trying to contact god through emotion or contact god through intellect or contact god through some other means works or or efforts or whatever but you can only contact god through faith the message perseverant from 62 he says now you've got five senses in your body god gave you those five senses to contact your early home that seed taste feel smell here but that has nothing to do with god there isn't any of them that will declare god amen what but i saw him break the bread but i saw him raise the dead i saw him lay hand and them come forth amen that didn't declare god to you amen because those people who saw that turned around and said crucify him crucify him crucify him they were contacted with something physically that they seen that caused an intellectual faith that was temporary amen that would turn around now and say crucify that wasn't contacting god but there was something deeper in the children of god in that day amen though they didn't understand though they were afraid and running away and hiding there was still something down on the inside that still believed amen believed in the midst of doubt believed in the midst of fear believed in the midst of running away there was still something there that could anchor their soul let's read this again let's see taste feel smell here but that has nothing to do with god there isn't any of them that will declare god not a one of them because they are only given to you to contact your earthly home see taste smell feel smell here that has nothing to do with god at all and people really people rely really upon them but you mustn't do that faith is something different faith is the sixth sense would you contact god you can only contact god by the sixth sense which is faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him see brother branham he had a he had faith but when his daughter was laying dying satan came to him and began to work on his intellect began to work on his emotion his love being began to work on his memory of his baby in his reasoning and he began to his eyes begin to see the condition of afflicted child his ears could hear her moaning amen and he could feel her amen her fever his senses were all working against his faith and the devil was working with all of his senses and now he sees he feels the fever he sees the affliction the eyes turn back with the twitching of her leg and then he can hear her moaning and her breathing and then the devil comes in and begins to flash memories of a little baby who would reach up her arms and go to him when he come home memories of love emotions that were flooding in and reasoning you after you've served god stayed up night and day and now your wife is in the morgue and now he's taking your baby how can you preach a god that loves you when all this is happening and brother branham says he about had me he about had me but then all of a sudden i pray it was like a black sheep come down god listen friends god would not meet that prophet with anything in his senses god gave him nothing in the senses to go off of and satan used every one of them against him you think oh god if you could just give me a feeling if i could just see something black sheep come down god gave him nothing for his senses the devil the devil started talking and finally he crossed the line on the word and something inside brother ben said devil get thee behind me though the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord he said what was it he said that faith sprung to life and he said brother branham how did you hold on he said i didn't hold on it held me there was something in me amen that i didn't put there he meant something that was that transcended my earthly existence that was before that'll be long after amen when all of my senses were working against me and the devil was using everyone against me and god refusing to give me relief in the senses think about it friends what does god want he doesn't want intellectual faith he doesn't want you to follow because i can see this is a good person this is a godly person amen and whatever they do i'm gonna do god's not looking for that god's not looking for well that makes sense to me when a way he explains the message that kind of makes sense to me i can see that and i can read the bible and i can see the pieces kind of fitting together that's not what he's looking for he's looking for somebody who says i have no idea what he's talking about but something in me says it's the truth my intellect is failing my eyes are failing the people that i thought believed i'm watching them fall away and commit sins and all kinds of things amen my senses are telling me that this could be wrong i'm looking at strife and division my senses tell me that this message could be wrong but something inside of me tells me it's right that's what god's looking for and you would think god could just make it easier by giving us more things for the senses right god you just make it easier like give us more things to see and to feel but sometimes god will take it all away because there's only one thing he's looking there's only one thing that overcometh the world one thing that's our victory over the world and that's faith one way to please god and that's by faith one way amen that we must live and that's by faith and god will so many times take away and and god is so good that sometimes there's feelings sometimes your your senses match the sixth sense and that's okay that's fine people would walk into a prayer line to come to brother branham they would hesitate he says oh you feel that they were feeling something you feel that oh that won't hurt you that's just the presence of the lord that's just the angel of the lord so let me describe that feeling it's a real warm sweet feeling isn't it they felt it the same person who felt it may even got delivered would turn around and deny the message so even if god sent down an amazing amazing feeling during the preaching of the word an amazing feeling and a pillar of fire moving around on the platform amen you could still go away and disbelieve because it happened thousands and thousands of times amen even the rich man asking god is it god send back lazarus to preach to my brothers he said though one raised from the dead they'll not believe because they don't have the sixth sense there's no seed on the inside to believe with god you can make it easy for us sitting down a warm sensation put a tingle all over our spine amen do flashes of lightning and balls of fire raise the dead do something so that i can see and sometimes god will do things and they help us and we appreciate them sometimes god will do nothing what does he want he wants that same thing to help brother branham when his baby was dying to hold you and i he wants that same thing that held his disciples when they were running away scared to hold us praise god sometimes we get into trials hardships difficulty we just say oh god if you could just let me feel your presence that's not an evil thing to ask for that's not wrong and many times in his sweetness and his gentleness he'll do that for us especially early in our walk when we're just babes in christ many times he'll do those things just to encourage us along the way because he knows where we're at but he wants maturity friends he wants us to walk by faith and not by sight he wants us not to rely on the senses amen there's traps we come into and difficult that we come into we just want god just to do something supernatural we just want and god has already done the most supernatural thing he can do for us he's revealed his word he's opened the book what more supernatural thing do we want he opened the book he gave us a perfect interpretation of the word with divine with divine vindication that's the most supernatural thing you can experience and god wants us to take that word by faith and stand upon it and watch it come to pass so there's nothing wrong with desiring because we've had some wonderful times with the lord and we'll have wonderful times again there's nothing wrong with desiring that amen but the thing that he's given us amen is a faith seed to believe his word and he's given us his word to believe let's go to john chapter 3. these things in the scripture familiar but i just want to bring it to our attention again john chapter 3 and verse 1. there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from god for no man can do those miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god now when we read this scripture for us it's old news i mean we've heard it we understand what he's talking about we understand the real meaning of this but just put yourself in nicodemus's place hearing this for the very first time never heard this before this concept never been presented before never heard it before and he says verily verily i say unto thee accept a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god and immediately nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born now now what nicodemus is doing is relying a hundred percent on his senses and in the natural flesh who could blame him nicodemus may be a foot taller than his mother at this time and she may be a little frail woman he may outweigh her by 50 pounds and he may be 10 12 inches taller than her and now he's saying you unless a man is born again born a second time he cannot see the kingdom of god and nicodemus asked the question when a man is old like me can he go back into his mother's womb again and be born how in the world are you am i going to be born again and now we use a term born again not born again born again we understand it but he has no idea to him born again means to come forth from the womb of a human mother again and he's asking how is this possible and jesus doesn't say i understand it's a little bit difficult let me explain it to you because that's not the kind of believer he's looking for he's not looking for somebody who can follow intellectually he's looking for somebody who can take the word because it resonates on the inside when he came to the woman at the well there was something that resonated inside amen when he come to so many they had something that resonated on the inside when he came to the pharisees all they had was intellect doctrine teaching understanding and nothing resonated on the inside he says let's go on 5 jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit marvel not that i say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou thou hearst to sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is every man that is born of the spirit nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and you testify that and and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness if i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things let's stop right there what was he saying he was trying to get nicodemus to understand that you have to have another birth he's using a natural type and he didn't understand it so he so he starts talking about that's born of flesh is flesh that born of spirit of spirit and look at the wind the wind moves through and you know where it comes from where it goes so is everyone and and he's trying to use a natural type to get nicodemus to understand and after the natural types he speaks of earthly things he said if i speak of earthly things you don't understand how will you ever understand if i speak of heavenly i'm trying to use the wind and the birth to get you to understand a spiritual truth in reality nicodemus answered and said how can these things be do you said art thou a master of israel knoweth not these things listen i'm going to keep reading what we read and i want to go to the next part verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness jesus had knowledge beyond human knowledge and he saw more than humanized saul he says i have told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man have to send it up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven jesus was not interested in getting nicodemus to understand his language he was looking for the seed he was looking for faith see sometimes we just want it simple i just want it easy i don't want it complicated i don't want it hard to understand just i want it simple and and sometimes people even fret at brother branham's preaching style they even get frustrated because he doesn't come right out and say it he alludes to it but doesn't say it and he says do you get what i mean i hope you understand what i'm saying without coming right out and saying it and you're listening like just say it and then he'll he'll start into a subject and he'll change subjects and he'll drop something and sometimes he'll drop it and never come back to it in that sermon he'll be cruising down a subject he's getting ready to answer the question and he's on this one and i want to know about this and he switches and turns another direction and for the rest of the sermon you're waiting because so many times he does this he goes and takes the rabbit trail and he comes back and he hits that but you're watching watching watching watching watching you get to the conclusion you sing this song he said god bless you my friends he turns it over and he never did address it and people get frustrated because they want the textbook on the message because what we really want is the is we really want to be comfortable with intellectual understanding because it makes us comfortable if two plus two equals four and two plus two always equals four then i am comfortable with two plus two equals four but what if all of a sudden somebody says 2 plus 2 equals 5 sometimes in certain conditions what conditions i can't tell you right now then all of a sudden our our our foundation is rattled all of a sudden our comfort level fades away because god is not trying to make us comfortable in our intellect and in our understanding he's looking for something that goes deeper something way down on the inside that says i don't understand my brother rem said it this way one time this way another time they look contradictory i don't believe he's contradicting himself but i can't correlate the two but something in me says that that man amen has the vindicate the true interpretation of the word by divine vindication and i'm going to believe it and i'm going to stick with it and god's going to give me the revelation on it when i need it as i need it if i need it but i'm not moving away from what faith tells me that this is nothing but the truth see we we're looking for somebody amen to put it in a package to make it simple somebody just to explain it so tightly amen that nobody can nobody can shoot holes in it nobody amen nobody can even just to shut the mouths of the critics they're looking for somebody to shut the mouths of the critics god's not going to let the mouths of the critics be shut if anything god made sure there was circumstantial evidence left behind [Music] you disbelieve i give you exhibit a and exhibit b in exhibit c so you can make your case and over on the other side brother venom drops little things i could drop a little something here exhibit a i hope you get what i'm saying without coming right out and saying exhibit b do you understand the trial's going on now you're the jury which one's right how do you know what's right how can you be sure because faith is a solid rock unmovable unflinching unchanging that's what god is looking for god's not interested in making us comfortable he's looking for his children and he's he's maturing his children and the sons and daughters of god 1959 a super sense he says how do you know when you haven't tasted the lord how do you know when you never receive the holy ghost whether he's real or whether he's not how do you know whether there's faith in power how do you know there's not joy unspeakable and full of glory when you've never tasted to see it the sixth sense leads you to that the sixth sense declares that to you there's no intellectual powers at all will ever bring that to you the intellectual powers will reason and say why it's psychology it's something this a way it's an emotion with the people but when the sixth sense comes in it denies all of those things and moves a person straight into the bosom of god in the face of critics in the face of criticism in the face of rejection and in the face of your own questions in your own mind amen the sixth sense moves you right into the bosom of god [Music] in 1962 it says we would see jesus it's a sixth sense five senses won't touch it it's the sixth sense five senses won't declare faith at all it's the sixth sense and the sixth sense is the one that declares the whole armor of god and the whole armor of god is nothing that one of the five senses will declare just think about the word of god and how the word of god is constructed amen and he says the the we're told to put on the former of god are we supposed to put on the full armor of god well where's your armor let me see it point to it tell me when you got it how did you get it how did you put it on how does it fit how did you make it do you make an adjustment to it see it's nothing to do with the natural it's all supernatural it's a helmet of salvation it's the feet shod with the preparation of the gospel it's a shield of faith amen it's loins girt with truth it's a breastplate of righteousness it's a sword of the spirit that's the word nothing physical nothing tangible nothing you can put your hands on but something you must have see god's good he says in the in the message if you'll notice on the platform in different places everywhere not only here everywhere the people come by they expect they've had too much of this here high pressure latter-day divine healing campaigns it's exactly right people say i got it in the hand feel it feel it you feel it no you don't feel it you might feel your hand but that's all you feel that's right jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it see not did you feel it do you believe it faith is not feeling faith is something that you don't feel you have no senses will declare it only that sixth sense that faith that knows it you don't feel taste smell or hear it but you know it because jesus said so that settles it it's not about feeling it it's about knowing it in the message the super sense from 1959 it says the supersense is the holy spirit the faith of god that dwells in you and if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the sixth sense it'll guide you and bring all other five senses under control of the supersense now i'd like to say any time that i've ever failed god and i know i failed god is is when god through a still small voice or something in the soul is moving me in one way and i allow the other senses to talk me out of it a god amen god through through uh uh god through a way of getting you to understand through the soul god through a way of whispering in your heart the still small voice is trying to move you some way or to make a decision or to make a move and all of a sudden reasoning comes in but if i do that this will happen if i do that they'll think this and if i say that this will and blah blah blah blah blah the last time i did that this happened memory if i say that they'll think i'm upset with them if i do that they won't understand me they'll reject me affection but if i do that this will happen reasoning and every time that i failed god is because i allowed the senses to supersede the sixth sense but there's been many times by the grace of god the sixth sense has superseded all the other senses and it's proved to be right when nothing else would declare it it's proved to be right amen when i when we come to the message we had nothing nothing nothing nothing but books and tapes we didn't go to a church we didn't have fellowship we didn't have other believers around all we had was books and tapes and everybody we knew disagreed with us and thought we were wrong and all the reasoning all the affection all the memory of bible training from the time you're a toddler amen all speaks against this message amen and i think back how did i ever make it through how did i ever keep pushing i was 21 years old newly married amen all kinds of pressure from outside the family thought we were crazy thought we were young 21 years old don't know anything no come around started pressuring us from the church pressuring us from family printing stacks of material hey you know a quarter of a ream of paper on things that proved that brother ben was a false prophet as a 21 year old kid i could say that now back then i thought i was all growing up and i think how did we make it how do we make it no support system nobody explaining it nothing all we had were books and tapes amen but there was a presence there amen that was awakening something on the inside that was saying this is the way walking in it amen i couldn't reason i couldn't understand it and then my emotions would go backwards my reasoning would be different but it was a sick sense that pushed through all the other senses and then all of a sudden you go back for years years you look back and you say it was god it was god it was god it was god it was god amen it wasn't any human it wasn't any human effort it wasn't any human ability everything on the human level was trying to stop us from moving forward but there was something inside that said this is the truth what about that i don't know i heard this i don't know i mean i heard all kinds of tales you know my grandpa was a wonderful man but he was in the pentecostal circles all down he was in the chautauqua meetings and he and he knew brother sullivan really well who put together to talk with meetings down in middletown and grandpa you would tell me well this man he went to brother ban brother bam said this and this man said you used to follow brother bam until until william branham got off on this and got off on that and this is my grandpa who i respect more than any other human being on the face of the earth and i couldn't answer his questions and i didn't know if it was true or not true but i couldn't stop believing this message it wasn't intellect it wasn't emotion it wasn't willpower it wasn't reasoning it sure wasn't sight amen it was god it was the sixth sense and the sixth sense can get you through that what else can it get you through everything in life back up here and read this out of the super sense again you'll bring all other five senses under control of that super sense for it's far above the natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it's it's it's as far and as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about him the devil can get into those five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that supersense that's far beyond his reach amen that come from god it's called faith faith is that great thing and the five senses does not control the sixth sense but the sixth sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the five senses is see taste feel smell here and the super sense is something that'll make you believe god's word for that's the only thing it'll speak about and it'll make you believe for things that you can't see taste feel smell or hear because it'll take god's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but god's word by faith faith does it now in giving this illustration of the senses the natural man is born with these senses so they are nature given senses and that's really and that's really only thing he'll ever know about in his intellectual thinking he can only think as a man he can see as a man he can understand as a man he can hear as a man but when he becomes governed or regenerated or we call it born again then that sixth supersense takes a hold of him and in doing so the supersense raises him up to a spot to where he has faith to believe things that he could not hear things that he could not see understandings that he could not understand understandings that he could not understand if there's something in the message you cannot understand now stick with the sixth sense it'll lift you to a spot where you can understand what you can't understand don't try to understand first believe if god's put it in your heart to believe stick with the sixth sense amen and watch god lift you to a place and all of a sudden it's amazing because one thing you try and you push and you try to understand and push against something and you come up with all kinds of wild ideas and things that don't fit and no understanding but let the sixth sense raise you up one time and all of a sudden click bang it's there you didn't push you didn't strength you didn't tie two things together you didn't manipulate a scripture you didn't take a quote and massage it around and shove it into place all of a sudden it just opened and you see it that's the sixth sense let that lift you up to understand things that you could not understand he believes it anyhow because he's governed by that sixth sense that super sense oh how marvelous it is to know it and to think how simple it is to believe now you cannot believe it until you are regenerated the bible said that no man can call jesus the christ only by the holy ghost we went through that last week and it's been such a stumbling block especially to the pentecostal believing people when they hear me say that jesus said saint john 5 24 he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me has eternal life eternal life comes from god alone and no man can save jesus as christ only by the holy ghost you're only taking what somebody else said what you've learned by intellectual what you learned by the nature five senses but when the sixth sense comes in the holy spirit it takes away all the reasonings of these six senses and five senses of five senses and lifts you up into the sixth sense to make you believe things that you can't see taste feel smell or hear does something to you then you can say jesus is the christ because you have witnessed it not what intellectual teaching has taught you but what you've experienced i'm going to finish this quote but i want to stop here for a minute this is why intellectual teaching in getting somebody to give a verbal confession of jesus christ will never equal to salvation because that's not faith that's intellectual reasoning and that's the ability to repeat words and say i believe that they're true words but unless that's the sixth sense on the soul there's no salvation it's just words it's just understanding like you understand math or you can read a book and you can take an exam and you can you can answer the questions correctly on the exam but that's not that's not salvation what is the sixth sense to do then brother bannon why do the sixth sense come the sixth sense come for this reason pay attention the sixth sense come for this reason now the sixth sense is the faith that supersense now the sixth sense come for this reason only that was to make the five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to god's word that's what the sixth sense is for the scripture speaks of casting down reasoning it's far beyond anything that the five senses would have to say about it now get ready for a healing service we believe it you walk by that sixth sense you talk by that sixth sense you live by that sixth sense you die by that sixth sense and rise by that sixth sense the super sense something that's in you that's different from what the natural man is in apparently a couple of paragraphs he says the sixth sense has come upon the human being to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of god what was the system given for what was the purpose what was the reason of the sixth sense to deny anything that's contrary to god's word anything in your mind anything in your emotions anything in your history your past your reasonings your memory anything in your affections anything that denies the word the sixth sense here is to cast it down and you have trouble struggling sometimes to believe that you're a child of god and god has delivered you from sin but you remember my past don't you know amen the sixth sense here is to get you to cast down your memory but i did this and i did that amen the sixth sense says god has put in the sea of gift for forgetfulness gets out of the mind of god amen it does not exist i never sinned in the first place the sixth sense here is to cast down the memory to cast down the reasoning that's what the sixth sense is here for that's why it was given amen because you come to this life trapped in this body stuck with this spirit amen shrouded by these senses that are limited and limitations upon us what's holding us down is our senses what is holding us back from the spiritual realities is our senses what was holding nicodemus back was the senses amen but when the sick sins come amen what was what was holding what was holding them back from the supernatural amen was the senses but when you can give something that will cast down the senses amen and cast down anything that will deny the word amen it will lift you to a place where all things are possible why because i believe the word if it's in the word it's possible if it's in the word it's for me the sixth sense has come upon human beings to make them deny anything that's contrary to the word of god your own affection wrong your own memory cast it out your own thinking and reasonings it's here to move that out of the way let's look at john chapter 5 verse 24. verily verily i say unto you john 5 24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life shall not come into condemnation condemnation but his past from death and to life 1965 brother rem says in the message it is the rising of the son so let me straighten a little scripture here for you i think we're off the phone but we're still here saint john 5 24 said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life now look i go down the street and just take that literally and what it what it is without this spiritual understanding not making it safe nothing else but just saying what it says see the right word here in the greek and the original it says he that understandeth my word now to prove that's right i go down here and here's a drunk coming along the street with some other man's wife in his arm and cussing and taking god's name in vain and everything else like that i said did you hear what that preacher said did you yeah i heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life see he that understandeth my word he that is an eagle it's not somebody that says well it doesn't matter what your intellect believes or can receive or yeah i heard with my ears that man i heard it and i heard what he said and no it's he that understand this and the understanding is not the intellectual understanding but it's the understanding that comes from the soul from the sixth sense the revelation understanding he says he that understands my word he is that he he that is an eagle now brother branham i want more scripture than that all right my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow his voice is his word in this age and a stranger they're not going to follow they're going to follow the shepherd let's go to matthew 13. there's just a couple more things i want to hit here before we wind down matthew 13. matthew 13 and 10. the disciples came the disciples came and said unto him why speak us down to them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to them is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not in hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias which says by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross it's grown thick and their ears are dull of hearing in their eyes they have clothes lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them so what is conversion hearing with your ears not these ears because they heard him with these ears and they saw him with these eyes but there has to be another set of eyes and another pair of ears that hear him and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear guess what the disciples saw the same thing they saw jesus is speaking of different seeing he's speaking of different hearing brother branham says in the super sense again by that same sense god spake when there was nothing what is that sense that supersense is god the faith of god in you the part of god that comes into you gives you the super sense by that same super sense god framed the world together with things which was not and did not appear i want you to think about this he said what is that supersense is god the faith of god in you not the faith of god not the faith in god in you but the faith of god in you the same faith god has is the same faith that's inside you and that's what he says it's the faith of god in you the part of god that comes into you gives you the super sense by that same super sense the same thing god framed the world together with things which was not in and which was not and did not appear he spoke his word and believed his word and the word shook into existence so the same thing god had god had faith in his word amen it was the faith of god and the faith of god would speak his word to believe in his word and when he believed in his word the word come to pass and now that same faith of god is coming to us the same faith that framed the world that spoke it and believed it and come to pass now he's spoken the word and we believe it and it comes to pass you know i just want to i just want to say this for a minute when brother van says to the disciples they seeing don't see and hearing they don't hear but your eyes see in your ears here jesus is not speaking physical friends brother branham came and over and over he did the sign of the messiah and millions saw it but you saw it and they didn't well you know but i wasn't there i wasn't sitting in the meeting i wasn't there there was you know there was a hundred thousand in that meeting or fifty thousand or ten thousand or fifteen thousand they saw the discernment there was thousands that saw brother branham turn his back to the crowd and begin to discern the thoughts of the people's hearts that were behind him and he was replaying the scene on the plains of memory when elohim came in a body of flesh any any any and he understood what what sarah was thinking in the tent behind him and began to discern the thoughts in her heart behind him and began to declare what was going on and brother bannon would set the scene with two amen with two messengers going down into sodom billy graham and oral roberts and one stayed up with the elect group and that one could discern the thoughts of sarah behind him and he would turn around amen they were all there they saw it but i would like to say this they saw it but they didn't see it and in seeing they didn't see but you saw it you'd be like well i didn't see the video that that wasn't on the video i saw of deep calls to leave i never turned his back no friends you saw it with the eyes you were supposed to see it with because you didn't need to see it with these eyes thomas comes to jesus and jesus says touch my hands touch us he says oh thou art the son of god amen thou art god he says because you see you believe but blessed are those who don't see and yet believe because we've seen him amen we seen him on calvary did you see him on calvary i mean with which eyes did you see him crucified which eyes did you see him bleeding for you and dying for you and paying the price of your redemption it wasn't these eyes it wasn't necessary to see it with these eyes it was necessary to see it with another set of eyes that could understand to hear it millions and millions of people have heard the prophet's voice amen and all they hear is a voice of a man with an accent from kentucky amen but they didn't hear the son of man they didn't hear jesus christ they heard the accent they heard the what the what the metal tape was able to record and they hear it crackle they hear some crowd noise and then they hear the man speaking but they heard but didn't hear when you hear you hear what is that it's the sixth sense on the inside the seeing you see and hearing you hear and now brother branham is playing out the scene amen elohim stepped into a body of flesh amen to to bring the promise to abraham and the same thing is taking place in our day amen and abraham's seed the royal seed is receiving the promised son and how do you know it because i saw it i saw the scene from the plains of memory i saw it not i saw a man turn around and discern that's not what i saw i saw god come down and replay this scene for me i saw it because i have eyes to see and ears to hear so many people saw a cloud anybody with eyesight could see a cloud there was thousands who reported the sighting of the cloud they took pictures of the cloud and said i see the cloud that's a strange cloud that's an odd cloud scientists would collect those pictures and study over those pictures and observe every every possible angle and everything they could to discern that cloud and they were looking at it and not seeing it you believe that and a scientist a scientist was collecting every picture that he could find and he was getting every eyewitness account and all the details he was collecting all the data to put his the greatest minds amen to to work on trying to solve the mystery of this cloud they saw the cloud but they did not see the cloud then brother branham holds up the cloud and and he begins to say it's that vision i had a pyramid of angels see the one with the swept back wings and see this and then people will look and be like yeah i can see like the white yeah i could see there may be some angels that's the angels okay i see it's angels and they didn't see it then in the message brother branham would say turn it to the right he turned it to the right and there he could see the face of christ just like in hoffman's head of christ he would take and he would show to the crowd he would just explain the story turn it to the right i am looking at it right no to the right so he turns it to the right he says see his eyes see his nose see his beard his black beard and there's people like oh oh some people are like there's some shadows in there there's a few little shadowy spots and some people will see and say i see it i see i see it's just like hoffman's head of christ wigged in angels and friends they still didn't see it they saw the picture but they didn't see us coming [Music] they understood the description the prophet gave of the picture they understood that the white thing was the wings of angels seven of them all together to outline the face of christ they could turn the picture they could look at the picture and they could see that yes i could see the shadows and the representation especially if i get the black and white one and i can see it looks just like hoffman's head of christ but seeing they did not see how come you see how come when you see the cloud it's not the cloud that you see it's not just the angels that you see it's not just the shadow that makes his eyes and his nose and his beard but when you look at that cloud it's more than the print life magazine went out and that image went all over the world and tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands i don't know how many thousands and thousands looked at the picture i went out in a science magazine amen they looked at the picture but they didn't see anything i mean they saw the white mark and they saw they didn't see anything seen but not seeing we hear the tape we look at the cloud it's not water vapor i mean if god used water vapor that's fine i don't care if he used water vapor or what he used i don't it's not the material that cloud is not the material it's made out of it's seven inches it's seven angels yes it's seven angels brother turn it to the right that's our lord up there i'd like to read that out of the rising of the sun but it said look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of god see the quickening power of god foretold this would take place see the quickening power of god made the world testify to it it's the truth the angel of the lord i told you was around in the pillar of fire quickening the quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was and we knew just looked us away it's our lord up there you see you could be sitting in the meeting that day and bobbing your head and seeing the outline of the face and the shadowy part of the eyes and the black beard and you could see that but you still didn't see what it was because there's some it's a picture on a wall to some it's something that happened in the sky in 1963 but when i see it it's my husband it's my bridegroom it's my lord and what has he done he's come what has he come for he's come to receive his bride where is he receiving his bride he's receiving her right now receiving her out of the systems out of the denominations out of the senses and bringing that bride and to himself he's uniting now with his bride he is coming that's my bridegroom that's my husband that's the revealed word that's come to me it's not a picture on the wall it's not water vapor in the sky it's my lord coming to receive his bride if you see the face hoffman's head of christ that's wonderful but if you see your husband coming to unite with you that's better because you can see and not see or you can see and see and i want to see and see i don't want to see what brother branham described and only go that way and tell him to oh if i look at huffman's head of christ i was big i could see the comparison i got it that's not it friends that's only a symbol that's only a token that's only a representation of what actually is happening the headship is here uniting with the body the bridegroom and the bride are uniting together the husband has come to receive his bride and if you don't see that you don't see the cloud i don't care what your eyes see or what the intellect can make out or what the reasoning can see in the shadows and blotches and sweat back rings if you don't see that you don't see the cloud because the sixth sense can pick up on more what does it mean he said look this way it's our lord up there he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals now all of a sudden the seals become more than white horse black horse red horse i can understand white horse and black horse and i yeah and i can understand the timing of this horse riding and you conquer no arrows i can see what no arrows mean and i can take what the prophet said and i can do it intellectually and i can make a a coloring book on it or i can make a workbook and say the white horse is this and the symbol of of no arrows means this and a bow and no he's given a crown and oh yeah the pope and and still not see it what is the opening of the seals [Music] he's the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals revealing christ your bridegroom is here to unite with you and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed so why why was the head outlined with seven angels to show that the seven church ages are completed and the completion of the seven church ages will bring the full revelation of the seven church ages in the end time which is the revealed word which is the headship because he is the word and the headship of the word shown that it's the collection of truth through seven church ages bringing us back to the original intent of the word is now here to unite with you personally if you see that you see the cloud amen i want to see that cloud not just the picture but i want to see it when brother man turns his back to the crowd it's not just an amazing thing a man that can know the thoughts of this woman over here and that was a man about five foot six and he had on a gray suit and that woman over there was in a red dress and he told her she had cancer that you're still not seeing it it's god it's the sign of the messiah it's the son of man he's here bringing the promise to abraham's seed if you see that then you see what that discernment was he said now the fairy seven angels which represents the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us brother bannon couldn't see the seven church ages were finished he didn't see the cloud in the sky they took the picture not us they seen it not us but what brother branham seen he saw the reality he saw the real thing they saw the picture he saw the reality let's read that again 7 30 is all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he's alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification and quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming it's not a picture it's a person it's not a doctrine it's my lord it's not a teaching it's my bridegroom it's my mate the revealed word he's coming to receive me and by faith he has received me amen i want to finish i want to move over to another scripture matthew 18 and i want to finish with this thought matthew 18 verse 1. matthew 18 1 at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven and whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me now i want to change our thinking a little bit on this scripture because jesus pulls a little child in to use that child as an example and he says who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus pulls a little child over called a little child unto him and set him in the middle of them so they could all see this little child and he's using the child as the represent representation or the token of what he wants to explain but all of his comments are not about that little child all the comments that he makes are about somebody that's converted to become like a little child so you understand don't make all these comments related to that little child that was only a symbol he was using to show what must happen you must be born again so he's telling you you must be born again you must have simple childlike faith the sixth sense must come to work and activate in your life and you must believe like a little child so let's read it again he said verily i say unto you except you be converted so now he's talking about people who are converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven because you must be born again you must be converted and grow up into the full stature of christ you cannot see the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same as greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever receive one such little child in my name receiveth me he's not talking about that little child he's talking about the one who's converted who shall receive one such little child that's the one who's humbled themselves and been converted one who receives a little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drown in the depth of the sea woe into the world because of offenses for it must needs that offense has come but woe to that man by whom the offenses cometh let's get down to verse 11. take heed that you despise not one of these little ones he's not talking about children he's talking about the children of god the converted children of god who he's referring to that's who you don't offend that the children of god take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven who's he talking about converted children their angels always behold the face of my father look at the next verse for the son of man has come to save that which was lost he's not talking about little kids anymore he's talking about the seed of god who's the greatest in heaven heaven has cherubims archangels seraphims a whole heavenly host in the kingdom of heaven but who's the greatest the born-again sons and daughters of god those are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven those that can humble themselves and realize my senses don't tell me nothing i don't know anything i've got to take the word and become humble like a little child and just rely on faith and you're going to be if you receive one of these little children that's the born-again child of god if you receive one of them you receive me and you better not offend them if you offend them it's better than a millstone he's not talking about little kids he's talking about the children of god the elect seed of god he said take heed your spies not one of these verse 10 again little ones for i say unto you this that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven for the son of man has come to save that which was lost remember you have to belong to him before you're lost you have to be his before you're lost if i lost something it was in my possession before i lost it so you have to be belonging to him you have to be in his possession before you can be lost so he's coming after his own how think you if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them have gone astray does he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth unto the mountains and seek that which has gone astray and if so be that he findeth that verily verily i say unto you he rejoices more of that sheep than of the nineteen nine which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish he's not talking about little kids anymore he's talking about the children of god and he says they're angels do always behold the face of the father be careful you treat them their angels always behold the face of our father meaning they have representation in heaven and because they have representation in heaven he's seeking to save which is lost amen because they already have representation in heaven they already belong to the father they're going to believe when they come in contact with the word because they already belong to the father they have the seed they are children of god they just haven't been converted yet here's what brother branham says they ask him this question questions and answers explain about each person's angel who abides with them from birth so now if you notice now this is pretty deep i want to say brother ben said this is pretty deep he's not talking about angels that are over there watching over all these little kids making sure they don't bump their knee i mean how does that work when kids are molested and murdered and fall and break bones all the time we got to change the nominational thinking and come to the message come to the word explain each person's angel abides with them from birth now notice this is pretty deep this isn't a denominational idea this isn't a little kid's version of the bible this is pretty deep now i never i just picked it up now part of it's wrote in type and the other one is in pencil he's talking about the question now there is an angel but this angel of the lord that are encamped about those that fear fears him now it isn't promised that sinners has angels only the redeemed has angels that's why when jesus is talking here and he's saying these little ones become like this one he's just using that child for an example he's not talking about all children little children all the little toddlers that's not he's talking about he's talking about you have to forget all you knew and become like a little child be born again and have simple faith and just believe the father and if you receive one of them you receive him if you offend one of him it's going to be bad for you because they're angels they have a representation in heaven you better be careful you treat them because they have a representation in heaven it's only the redeemed has angels do you know that the angel of the lord and camp about those that fear him now angels are messengers i want you to notice it's so perfect and it'll prove predestination to you you're not going to get an angel you already have an angel beholding the father's face and if you have an angel beholding the father's face then then the shepherd is here looking for his lost sheep because there's already a representation there of that sheep it proves predestination friends we can't pray lord give my child a guardian angel that's the denominational idea but the redeemed has angels it'll prove predestination to you now when a little baby is being formed under the mother's heart and your little children don't understand these things the lord gave you to mother and she carried you under her heart because you're close to her heart and then one day the lord came down and delivered you from mother's heart from away from her heart but you'll always be in her heart now while this little body is being formed the little natural body being formed in the mother there is a spiritual body of the earth catch this an earthly spirit there is a little body of the earth ready to receive this natural body as soon as it's born now the baby is born with live muscles a beating heart but no breath of life in it it's muscles twitching see then see if there was something different from that if there wasn't a spirit that had to come into it later then our breath could leave us and we would breathe no more and still be alive brother makes this simple is it to be alive you have the breath of life amen and so now there's an earthly spirit a spirit of the earth not eternal not in the heavens a spirit of the earth that when the child takes the breath of life that spirit comes in and it becomes a living person everybody gets that whether you're elect or not everybody gets that little spirit of the earth catch what he's saying because if not you could stop breathing and still be alive [Music] so when the spirit goes out you die so he says but when this body doesn't receive oxygen from our breath and take an outtake of our lungs then we're dead now when the mother the little baby is dropped to the earth from the mother's heart dropped you understand what i'm saying when i'm birthed dropped the reason i'm saying it this way when the little baby is dropped what happens as soon as it comes forth if it doesn't start crying the doctor midwife or whatever will spank him stretch it it's got to have a got to have a shock and what happens notice mother she can be ever so mean and cruel but just before that baby's born there's a certain kindness that sets in did you ever notice a mother when she's to be mother there's something sweet about her she always takes on the sweetness it's because that little angel little spirit little messenger to this little tabernacle is ready to come forth into the world and when this little angel comes into the baby that's a little angel of the earth he's not talking about the one that beholds the father's face he's not talking about anything eternal he's talking about a natural spirit of the earth so that's why he's applying this to all mothers not just christian mothers all mothers of birth all babies not just elect babies so you can't see a mother who's actually real real real sweet and be like there's an elect child coming that little angel's there and one mom's a little bit irritable he's not talking about that that angel that beholds the father's face he's talking about the angel of the earth he said when this little angel comes into the body that's a little angel of the earth a spirit that's ordained of god to take this body then that baby has to have a choice it makes its decision talking about receiving the word you have to come to earth to be tested to be tried by the word so you receive a a spirit of the earth amen just like everybody else has and you've got a soul and you've got a spirit of the earth and you've got a a body that's born in hybridization just like everybody else has but you have something that nobody else has amen you've got a seed down on the inside a gene of god in the soul and a representation in heaven now don't ask me how this works mechanically because i don't understand how it works mechanically i can't explain what form how physical where is it when it i don't i don't understand all i know is what brother branham said and what the scripture says and i believe it just like i believe there's angels lining this wall you brother said you brought them with you in the car praise god friends the sixth sense says amen it comes it has to have a choice it makes its decision then when this takes place then you see the angel of the lord now comes in here which is a spiritual body of the eternal what's happening something with that angel of the lord that guarding names with that spirit amen the angel that was beholding father's face says something to do with your conversion that's what the prophet said i don't understand it i'm not going to try to explain it because i'll mess it up but it's nothing but the truth the angel of the lord now comes in here which is a spiritual body that eternal this is a dying spirit and a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two natures in you at one time now the nature of the spirit of the lord when you're born again you're not born to physical like the baby was but what's happened the spiritual birth has come to you why because you had an angel of the lord watching over you and when you made your decision a minute come in here i don't know what he's pointing at but he come in here and you've took the spiritual birth and the spiritual birth has come to you and while this spiritual birth is growing into your heart of god there is a physical or celestial body growing to receive that spirit and when the life leaves this body it goes to that body just as when the body is presented to the earth the spirit comes in and when the spirit goes out of the body he now he's talking about two different spirits two different spirits amen because the one spirit is the earthly spirit brother said it will go when you die and be no more but he said now listen and when this life leaves this body it goes to that body he's talking about the celestial body just as when the body is presented to the earth when you're born in the earth the spirit comes in and when the spirit goes out of the body there is a body waiting an earthly spirit comes in but then there's a conversion and there's another spirit there that's working now and when you die the earthly spirit goes and breaks up amen but the other spirit goes to that celestial body [Music] where was it in heaven eternal where do i have representation in heaven friends it's a link between heaven and earth you're not here on your own you're not here of your own devices you're not here with no help it's not just you it's just not just you in the flesh and there's a there's a sixth sense on the inside there's an angel spirit beholding the father's face there's something that's going to happen when that seed begins to quiver and take the word there's going to be an injection of life there's going to be a regeneration of the soul there's going to be life that comes from that seed gene there's going to be a spirit life that's in there a spiritual birth and when this body dies that spirit that was born there in the soul goes to the celestial body and that spirit that's in me that goes to celestial body is beholding the father's face listen i'm not even going to try to explain that but what i'm going to tell you is that there's a spiritual birth in me there's something that that has come to awaken a seed in me there's been a regeneration there's been a spiritual birth that spirit that's in me amen when this body dies that spirit that life will go into that celestial body but that spirit that life that's in me the son of man which come to earth which is in heaven now the spirit of life that is in me that will go to my celestial body is beholding the father's face in the throne room of the seventh dimension now according to the scriptures and the message how does it work don't you dare ask me to explain it i'm not going to mess up what the prophet has brought why do you believe you were predestinated to believe the ingredient was placed inside of you why do you have eyes to see and ears to hear because you've got another set of eyes that can see the father's face you've got another set of ears that can hear the father's voice it's more than what you've got in your physical makeup there's more to you than meets the eye why is it when you see that cloud amen you see the bridegroom when you see the cloud you see your invisible union others see the physicals others hear what the prophet said others can pass the test but to you it's more than a cloud it's your lover it's your bridegroom it's your mate it's the invisible union it's him here receiving you it's the fullness of the word it's the headship uniting with you the body why because there's an angel who's beholding the father's face that can hear what's going on in the throne room and it's connected to you through the soul somehow i don't know how but it's there that's why there's things that you just know to be the truth prove it i can't prove it but it's the truth why is it the truth why was that little samaritan woman who was on her sixth husband coming to the well living a bad life a dirty life amen why was it she was hungering and thirsting for god why was it she wanted to know the proper place of worship why was it when she met a man that could tell her about her husband's she didn't say can you show me where to get a good job and could you tell me where i lost my money she says sir i perceive that you're a prophet the elders say worship here and you say worship there where can i worship god where did that come from that wasn't anything in the natural part of that woman that was something from the sea down on the inside and brother branham said she could receive his word because she had representation in heaven because they're there there are angels always behold the father's face why is it you can believe why is it you can see because you got more eyes than the ones that are in your head and you have more ears than the ones that are attached to the side of your head you've got eyes and ears that can access the throne room of god how does it work i can't tell you how all i can tell you is it works because the sixth sense in me knows it's the truth knows it works knows it's real i i've experienced it i've seen it i've stood on the word i was given something that i didn't have in myself an understanding i couldn't understand a willpower i didn't have an overcoming deliverance that wasn't coming from the flesh there was something coming from the sixth sense something more than what was happening in this flesh and it's a living reality to me how do you know it i know it prove it just wait just wait and he will prove it by changing my atoms whatever that is whatever part of me the perfect triune being and what part's here and what part's there and what part moves from here to there i don't know i can't tell you i can't draw a map through the dimensions of heaven and put this in the six and this and the sev and me here all i know is one day all of it's going to align into one vessel in this body that's changed and i'm going to be the perfect triumph beating all that i was supposed to be all that he intended for to me i will be you want me to prove it just wait if you don't have eyes to see your ears to hear you'll see me sitting with him on the throne at the day of judgment and you'll stand before the reality [Applause] that'll be proven amen but i'm saying who is this melchizedek then after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food then you left the other thing you have you have then been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany amen this earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting eternal in the heavens heavenly representation see friends that representation over there according to what the prophet says has influence over you here i'll read it again so you can understand after you recognize the very word of god was eagle food why ears to hear then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the living god you heard from your theophany i didn't hear anything no i heard something that means whatever that is there has influence on you here and if we could learn to deny what we see what we think how we feel if we could learn not to be tossed about by emotions and reasoning and fears and complexes and what we see and what the news is telling us in our ears and what we see happening on if we could learn to not live to those things and deny all of those things but hear from our representation in heaven and begin to be able to respond amen to the life on the inside i wonder what kind of life we'd live friends if we could cast down reasoning in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of christ and bringing the captivity every thought to the obedience of christ who is the word how are you going to do that you've got to be awakened to the living realities of a living god of angels and seraphims and cherubims and angels lining these walls and it's all here and it's all reality and it means more than the physical things that we touch and if that realm and if you have a link amen from this realm to that realm if there's a physical being in this realm that's got a data cable a data cable that links to another realm it can plug into the seventh dimension don't plug it up don't ruin your bandwidth with doubts and reasonings and intellect amen leave the channel open amen and don't plug it up with your reasoning don't plug it up with your fear don't plug it up with what you see in the news leave it open to the word and let whatever is attached to both ends of this reality bring the revelation down truth upon truth upon truth upon truth because that's the only way we'll receive it not from the brain amen there's got to be representation in heaven we've united to that representation how i don't know how give me some time i'll explain it all to you later but it's the truth friends we've made a connection something was disconnected when we come to this life the thing that was disconnected from us was always there you had a port here and a port here these things were predestinated to come together i'm sorry for all you i.t guys i'm ruining all this i'm probably using wrong terms and everything but you had a seed in the soul and you had a connection through an invisible some part of you in another dimension something that represents you somewhere else and it was all around but one day you had to make your decision you come in contact with the light the light moved away all the shroud of darkness is all around you and all of a sudden click you recognize that the very word was eagle's food you left the others and you downloaded from your theophany the revelation of god amen praise be to god and friends if you can get that download what else can he download if you can receive that transmission from a heavenly realm what else can you receive from a heavenly realm i don't think that i just asked a question i don't want anyone to inject my own thinking i just want to ask you the question do you think that was the only time you ever heard from your theophany or do you think that's the only time you could ever possibly hear from your theophany and if you could hear from your theophany once to bring one revelation to the message could you hear from your theophany again to bring another revelation to the message i'm just asking i'm not telling you i'm just asking but what does the sixth sense tell you is it possible is it going on is it happening now praise god in the masterpiece 1964 brother bram says we realize that we're in a negative form and as long as there's a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive c because it's because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or to strike the light to strike the lens or there wouldn't be any negative praise god so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that light has struck and it's reflecting something here on earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere do you hear do you hear do you hear or do you hear where are you hearing because i'm hearing a whole lot more than what i'm hearing the genuine object is somewhere if that isn't i'm the worst deceived man in the world i've spent my life in vain but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's there that's why we're here i'm here believing the word i'm here connected to the supernatural because the real reality the positive is somewhere else and i'm only reflecting this here is only reflecting that and if i'm here believing the word if i'm here living the word then there's something else somewhere that's the positive that i'm only representing [Music] and i'm going to be lost and it's going to fail and it won't work he come to seek and save that which was lost and through a supernatural rebirth he's connected to cable again i say let's disconnect the other one forget what the news is saying forget politics we'd like to forget politics and let's get all of our information from another news source let's get all of our reality not from a textbook not from google not from the news but let's get all of our reality let's tap into our ears and to our eyes and to our understanding and let the spirit of god teach us let the spirit of god guide us let the spirit of god lead us i'd like to close by reading first corinthians if we could read this together musicians if you could come brother ben if you can make it up first corinthians chapter two first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9. but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither has entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by the spirit now let's just read the first verse again nine but as it is written i had not seen nor ear heard neither entered into the heart of men the things which god has prepared for them that love him okay stop i can't know it i'll have to wait never enter and die never enter the heart the things that god prepared for man okay that's not what paul's saying paul's saying you can know it you can hear it you can see it but god hath revealed them to us by his spirits for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things which are freely given to us of god what i thought you couldn't hear it and you couldn't see it didn't enter your heart no it's freely given to you to know which things also we speak not in the worlds in words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things that he himself judge is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ let's all stand praise god amen i'm going to read to you out of revelations 22 17. revelations 22 17. and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth who's the bride calling those with ears to hear the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth not with these ears but let him that heareth the bride's called the spirit calling through the bride let him that heareth also say come r who are we calling to those with ears to hear not natural ears but ears somewhere else that can hear the word let's keep calling friends we're still here there's got to be somebody else with ears there's got to be there may not be but there's got to be somebody else with representation in heaven just like the little woman at the well and you can jesus preached the multitudes and they rejected him and he preaches to one little woman trapped in adultery and she believes we may we may share the message with thousands of people who reject us but there may be one little person who will still receive god is good friends we have ears to hear eyes to see and a heart to perceive and has nothing to do with this body god has all done it for us and now let us give ourselves completely over to that revelation let's bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father we thank you god for your word we thank you god for sending a prophet in our day to open to us the understanding that's in the word for god you have you have saved the mystery for this hour you have saved the revelation holding it back only giving it part showing it types and giving it shadows but you've held it back for this very hour and now lord you've opened the door in heaven so that we can receive all of this revelation i pray god that you would keep the channel clear forgive us lord for reasonings forgive us lord for giving heed to what a natural ear i see and ears hear go on and help us to be weaned off of feelings help us to get away from intellect and reasoning and emotion help us lord to have that sixth sense come alive and begin to operate and give us the true leadership that we need by the leadership of the holy ghost it's quickened to life that sixth sense may we follow that leadership by divine revelation may you speak to us lord may you continue to pour your revelation in our heart and may we walk by revelation not by sight walk by faith not by sight and faith is a revelation help us to have the courage to walk by the revealed word to walk by the revelation that you give us as individuals and take that courage lord and walk that road every step in your word for that's what you reveal to us as your word bless us lord as we seek in those that are lost let us have a voice that says come come and drink those that are able will come they'll have ears to hear and they'll also say come and drink i pray you find all your little lost sheep lord that you keep those angels watching over them until the word can get there lord that you can quicken that word to life god that you can gather us all together under your headship that you can take us all home we can move to the millennium lord well we love you make our eyes see and our ears here and our heart to perceive all that you have for us in this day we ask it in jesus christ's name [Music] amen [Music] oh i'm living [Music] i'm trusting confined [Music] is [Applause] is [Music] [Music] if [Music] and all of my worry is [Laughter] um [Music] [Applause] clouds the master looks [Applause] i'm living by faith [Applause] [Music] no [Music] if jesus walks close to my side [Music] [Music] um [Applause] [Applause] is oh our lord has returned to this earth some sweet day our troubles will then all be i'm living by faith in jesus is i'm living by i'm is [Music] oh there are two roads you may one take side and one by faith just take the word of god what you believe is you can fly in a higher place do not struggle [Music] so what's your name is it much or you will fly in a higher place [Music] oh [Applause] is already me in a higher place do not struggle [Music] there's one by side and there's one by faith is [Applause] [Music] it's [Music] [Applause] to the winds of faith [Music] [Music] and my faith looks now hear me pray take all my guilt away oh let me from this day is [Music] my god please me [Music] is is fear and distrust [Music] [Music] be this day me
