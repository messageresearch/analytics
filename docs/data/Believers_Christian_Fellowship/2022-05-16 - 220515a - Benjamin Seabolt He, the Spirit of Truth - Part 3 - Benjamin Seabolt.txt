[Music] let your spirit [Music] i wonder if we could sing it speak through me me lord speak through oh me gave all myself to the lord's speech [Music] lord speak to me [Music] amen let's pray together precious lord jesus we just want to pause here once again and approach you by way of prayer father thanking you for this opportunity that you've given to us once again to come and to worship you father and to be a privileged people to not come and worship in vain but to come and into worship and spirit and truth lord and as we just sang father we want you to come and speak to us lord that we could leave this this building this morning that you would have the capacity to speak to the world through us father for we know that is your declaration and your instructions at the end of the book lord for us to go forth as your bride and to prophesy again lord but how would we be capable to do that lord if you would not first come and speak to us lord how would we know what to say or what to do father so we just asked that you would come and that you would do both parts lord that you would plant the seed and that you would make the seed to produce that which it was planted for we just want to come and commit ourselves to you father lord we stand here as mere mortals lord one not having the capacity to speak that which is needed and the other not having the capacity to even hear that which is needed to be heard unless you would come father and anoint both the speaker and the hearer so we just commit ourselves completely to you thanking you once again for this opportunity in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you this morning i trust everybody is feeling well and doing good and if you're not then i hope when we're done you're feeling well and doing good but if you have your bibles we'll go to john 16 and probably not a big shock to most of you but i just want to continue with this thought of he the spirit of truth and i'm kind of stuck on this and i'm not real sure when i'll get unstuck on it so you either just have to enjoy it with me or bear the burden so you can take your pick but in john 16 beginning in verse 12 i want to read this portion of scripture it says i have jesus speaking he says i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you god bless you as you would have your seats and just so that you know i do have a quote for getting stuck on this subject and i want to read it to you in the church age book brother branham says he's quoting a theologian from the 1600s and he says in divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of god each one shatters as he pleases or kills time by learned disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of christ to become partakers of the divine nature scarcely anything is said so there's my quote for getting stuck on this subject i don't want to be guilty of that i don't want to be guilty of chattering as i please or disproving the views of others and scarcely saying anything of the new birth and how that we must become partakers of the divine nature so that's definitely the thrust of this topic that's definitely the the inspiration that i have behind this and you know we've said a lot and no doubt we'll say more but we don't want to lose focus of the real point of this entire subject and the real point is i my burden just my personal burden is to go back and get a clear and proper understanding of a scriptural definition as taught by brother branham of the new birth and of the baptism of the holy spirit and what that entails because as i said before there is times that we we cannot find what we're seeking if we don't know what we're seeking for and there are times that we can find something and obtain something and yet not know what that is and i've gave you the example before of the interview that brother branham did with sister bruce this was a lady who did have the baptism of the holy spirit but in herself she was completely tore up day in and day out because she failed to recognize what it was that had changed her so i just want to again this is not what i would consider a deep topic or you know spiritual rocket science but this is something that is just a burden on me i i want to i personally want to be settled and i want to be confident and i want to be established in what god has done in my life and i want to recognize that for what it is and i also want to be fellowshipping with a group of people that are in that same position so if you don't have this experience and it is an experience if you don't have this experience you need to get this experience but you need to get this experience based on what the prophet has taught us from the scriptures not not anything else not somebody else's experience but we have to get this experience per what the prophet has taught us from the scriptures so if you don't have it you need to get it but if you do have it you need to allow it to bring its scriptural definition which is the comforter into your life and when the comforter comes into your life it is going to have the capacity to bring a settledness and a stability to you that no man can and that's only going to come by one way that's either that's going to come by recognizing he the spirit of truth has come into your life so the points here is a scriptural definition of receiving the holy spirit is taught by brother branham and there's two prongs that go with that we can never forget that the spirit and the word are the self-same being whenever we separate the spirit in the word and make them something different that's automatically not what paul taught and it's automatically not what brother branham taught and it automatically will put you into a denominational realm into a denominational spirit because that is exactly what all of the denominations have done they have separated the evidence from receiving the word and because they've done that now they have the ability to leave the word it's that simple so we must not under any circumstances allow the spirit and the word to become something different to us they are the self-same being you cannot receive this the holy spirit without receiving the holy word the holy spirit comes writing on the holy word you must receive the word for your age in order to receive the holy spirit you cannot receive it any other way if you could receive it any other way that takes our message and does away with it it is not necessary again this is very simple but i just want to make sure that we're established in this and the second prong of that is we we should never overlook or de-emphasize the ability and capacity within ourselves to repent those are the two prongs and the two sec the two things that if you forget everything else that i chatter about don't forget those two things never separate the word and the spirit and never ever ever de-emphasize the ability and capacity that you have in your life to repent because that is a special capacity to a special group of individuals and some of us need it more than others and that's okay but the fact that we have the capacity to always repent and line up to the word of god we should thank god every day for that saints even if we have to use it and do it every day we should thank god for that capacity because it's not about getting it right the first time you would really have to under you know me as a person to know what it means for me to make that statement because i'm a perfectionist and i i have to get it right the first time but in this topic in the grand scheme of things in this what brother branham says this hickey of time that we're in it's not about getting it right the first time every time it's about the ability to repent and line back up with the word i don't have a problem with people getting confused and preaching wrong doctrine what i have a problem with me or anybody else is is once that's exposed as wrong doctrine the inability to repent and line up to the word making a mistake or going in error or getting confused about something or seeing something not exactly right or clear is not the problem that is not the problem because we've all done that and we're all probably doing that right now about something and we're all probably going to do that in the future about something that is not the problem the the problem is kane's problem that's the the that's the original problem i guess it would go farther back than that would be lucifer's problem the inability to humble yourself and line up to the word of god that's the only problem so those are my points let's move on brother random says i referenced this quote to you last time so i wanted to read it to you brother random says in the church book he's quoting revelation he says be zealous and repent he says now this false church has zeal make no mistake about that her zeal has literally been that of the jews john 2 17 the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up but it is a wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building also known as your own idea it is for their own creeds their own dog dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they depose the holy ghost and make men into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person and made it good works or even church conformity rather than good works but god is calling for another zeal it is the zeal to cry i am wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong what is it that all these denominations are based upon the claim to originality and that of god the claim that they are right so if you want to have a denomination all you have to do is depose the word of god and claim that you are right it can be a one-man denomination a one-woman denomination it doesn't have to be a big one they depose the holy ghost but listen what they substitute for that they depose the holy ghost and make men into leaders so this could be another man that you have allowed to take the place of the holy ghost and lead you falsely or this could be yourself that you have allowed to take the place of the holy ghost and lead yourself falsely that is what happens when you depose of the holy ghost of the spirit of truth but brother branham says the zeal is to cry the correct zeal is to cry i am wrong that has been my zeal for the last i don't know how long several months years whatever is i'm waking up every morning and before my feet hit the ground just acknowledge the fact lord i am wrong i'm going to get today wrong if you do not come and supernaturally intervene in my life i'm going to get it wrong that's just the facts i don't stand a chance i don't have a chance i we have got to come to a comfortableness in recognizing our inability to get things right that is the correct and proper zeal to line up to the word not take another man's idea not take our own idea but to line up to the word first john 5 6 says this is he that came by water and blood even christ jesus not by water only but by water and blood it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth the spirit is truth the spirit is the word john 15 26 but when the comforter is come whom i shall send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth remember we're looking at a scriptural definition of the holy ghost of the holy spirit of the new birth of the token the spirit of truth john 6 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him who he hath sent and as we would finish this review portion i just want to emphasize that there are going to be many manifestations of the holy ghost of the holy spirit of the working of god there is going to be many manifestations of that but the one baseline manifestation that every true believer must have and will have is they are going to give proper placement and belief in he whom god has sent period if they cannot acknowledge that and they cannot make that their absolute they are not led of the spirit of truth they are not doing the works of god and if they are not doing the works of god there is only one other person's works who they are doing this is the work of god that ye believe on him who he hath sent for our day and for our age we had one messenger and that was brother branham to deviate away from what he taught or to think we have a better idea we have automatically begin working the works of satan because the works of god is to believe on he whom he hath sent so as soon as we deviate from that we are anti-word we are antichrist if you want to get anywhere with god you must first and foremost recognize he whom he hath sent for your age must and then if you really want to get anywhere with god you must recognize who your pastor is that's free but i'll just throw that in there you will never get to your appropriate position in christ without first recognizing who god is who god has sent and who god has placed you under locally it's a chain of command and god has one i can really preach now because i really like chains of command you have to be in your chain of command kid to get anywhere with god if not you're going to find yourself in the middle of a battle when the heat is on wondering what to do and where to go because you don't know who your chain of command is and i just made it real simple your chain of command is god the prophet that he sent to you and your pastor now under that pastor there's many gifts there's many manifestations there's many helps there's many works in the field there's captains there's lieutenants there's sergeants and there's privates so there's people that's actually getting the work done but there's people telling them how to do that and where to go one is just as important as the other it's not necessarily chain of command as in levels of importance it's levels of position levels of placement so in order to really properly do the work of god you must believe on he whom he hath sent and be positionally placed locally where you belong in ashamed brother branham says remember you might meet a spirit that would act like god you might meet a spirit would do this that or the other but follow it a little bit and see how it compares with the word of god you might meet a spirit that would tell you you are saved and give you a glorious feeling and you would shout and scream but then when it comes to denying the word how can the holy spirit that wrote the word deny his own word if it isn't then you never met god you met a deceiving spirit and the world is full of it today what is the world full of a spirit that would make you feel that you are saved give you a glorious feeling make you shout and scream but deny this much of the word that's what the world is full of easter seal brother branham said and the same thing is with every true believer when the preaching of god's word goes forth it is vindicated and proved that it is god's word god's word for the hour then there's something within the believer if that church is teaching crime contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message there's something in him that screams out that's what the holy spirit was given to you for that's what he the spirit of truth the comforter the token was given to you for to be able to recognize whether this is the word for my age or is this something contrary he says of the word for the day so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery holy spirit so again we've quoted this several times but we have to recognize that there is a mockery holy spirit a spirit that would make you feel that you're saved scream shout jump dance but is actually mocking the holy spirit which you're truly seeking because it will give you a slight deviation away from the word brother branham says the world is full of that today he says we have to be careful he says because i'm afraid a lot of times we actually just catch a church spirit he says or one another's spirit see we have to come back to a scriptural definition as what the prophet taught or we're going to end up with a spirit making us feel like we're right when we're wrong remember it's to be so close it would deceive the very elected just because you're elected and you're convinced that you'll end up right at the end and i'm convinced you'll end up right at the end don't think that you can't be deceived for a minute don't think you can't take a wrong spirit don't think you can't be confused as soon as we deviate away from the message of the hour we're going to take a wrong spirit and we're going to get confused but if we'll stick with it in its simplicity it alleviates so many problems and it exposes so many problems and attributes of the devil and it brings a settledness to us because i feel and this is just me personally but i feel the reason that we get unsettled even in our later years of life i feel the reason that we get unsettled is we deviate away from the simplicity of the message we feel like we should be doing something more or more dynamic or more manifestations and we get ourselves worked up and unsettled instead of just simply relaxing as job did job said what is the word for my hour i've done it nothing moved job not even the preachers that came to him nothing moved job job had a revelation for the word of his hour what the requirements were for what what the requirements was and he says i've done them there's nothing else to talk about here we're done there is no more word for me to do i've done it i'm fine see job had a confidence in the word just in its simplicity he could relax under that and that's where we need to get to is simply to relax not have to be somebody else not have to have manifestations of somebody else but have to manifest belief in whom god hath sent brother branham says he says if it's not a mockery holy spirit if it's not the devil mocking the holy spirit but it's the real true holy spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour this is where we can bring a lot of clarification to this because if we didn't know what the promise of this hour was we could interpret this however we wanted to and we could make this whatever we wanted to but when the prophet comes on the scene and he says the manifestation for this hour is the bride christ coming in the form of the bride that is the manifestation for this hour now we can identify what is a mockery holy spirit because a mockery holy spirit will be anything other than the manifestation of the bride of christ in the form of the bride in the form of you that is a mockery holy spirit see if we did if he didn't define these things to us then these statements alone we could still take and make whatever we wanted but that's why we have to take the entirety of the mess the message and allow him to define what the promise of the hour is not make the promise of the hour what we want it to be or what we think it should be we have to make the promise of the hour what he said the promise of the hour was and that is christ in the form of his bride so that may get a little tight that may get a little pinchy but i'm going to say what the prophet said anything that's not declaring that the manifestation for this hour is the bride of jesus christ christ himself in the in a female expression the fullness of the word in a female expression that's a mockery holy spirit it's antichrist it is satan it is a devil and i don't care what other title it brings religious-wise he's already identified it remember brother branham said religion is satan's business so if you're a mockery holy spirit guess what realm you're going to be operating in a religious realm it's not going to be the guy in the bar or the prostitute on the street or whatever nefarious dark evil bad black horse rider you want to think about brother branson it's going to be a slicker that's the one you better watch around your wife who do you think christ is watching around his bride it's a man in a suit with a bible and a slight deviation from the promise of the hour that's who christ is concerned about being around his bride he's not worried about the black horse rider we'll recognize that for what it is so close that it would deceive the very elected a mockery holy spirit is what you understand what i'm saying christ is worried about his brother he's not worried about his bride he knows she's been predestinated but that is who the bride is doing spiritual warfare with that is who he is watching that is who he is guarding her against is that slicker that's what brother that's what the prophet told us a slight deviation away from the word in the church age book i'm not going to read all of this but brother branham says this at this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of of matthew 24 24 in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect and who shall attempt to deceive the very elect why the spirit of antichrist in the false anointed ones but he goes farther and he identifies these false anointed ones he says religious omaha they outshine the elect in effort and zeal but it is lesion not of christ for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them this is where the rubber meets the road they preach the second coming of christ but deny the advent or coming of the prophet messenger remember he's talking about false anointed ones deceiving the very elected if it was possible and he identifies their doctrine as preaching the second coming of christ they will preach the second coming of christ but they deny the coming of the prophet messenger they preach the second coming of christ but they deny the coming of the prophet messenger it would seem to me that the second coming of christ is directly linked to the coming of the prophet messenger and they will preach one but not the other just in case you're missing i'll make it real clear they are preaching a doctrine of the second coming of christ without recognizing that he came in the form of the word through his prophet messenger that is the doctrine that brother branham tied to matthew 24 24. deceiving the elect if it was possible saints if we fail to recognize that christ himself came in 1963 in the form of brother branham the word being manifested in its entirety we are going to be deceived because we are going to look for something else other than the promise for this hour if we cannot recognize the form that god has chose to come in in this day is his word you may want it to be a jesus coming on a cloud with nail scars in his hand or whatever form you may want it to be in you can want it to be whatever you want it to be in but you don't get to choose he said i'm coming in the form of my word and i'm going to reveal that through a son of man that's how i'm coming receive it or not that's how i'm coming and if we fail to recognize that and preach another coming of christ we by default have made ourselves anti-word and antichrist and we are not going to get anywhere with god we have got to accept god in the form that he wants to come in and that was the form of the fullness of his word as expressed through his prophet brother branham simple i know elementary some would say but i've i don't have to take anybody else's word for this i've seen this in my own lifetime what the deviation away from that produces and i'll tell you what it produces it produces a bunch of people on an altar over and over and over and over seeking something that's laying right in front of them and then by perchance they actually do get what they're after because i believe they're sincere in heart they will wonder and wonder and wonder and wonder if they've really got it that's what that doctrine produces but a doctrine of recognizing that my god my christ has came to me personally in the form of his word in the fullness of his word and i have accepted that as taught by my prophet messenger produces the exact opposite of that it produces a stability and established people who do not wonder if they're the bride of jesus christ or not they know that they know that they know who they are in so much that their outer realms can tell them every day you're not you're not you're not and that word on the inside will still declare i am i am i am that's what we're after saints that's rapturing faith that is a faith that you have been caught up into that will eventually catch your 16 elements up let's not be deceived let's not be deceived let's allow it to be as simple and as straightforward as it is brother and says when he was baptizing and jordan jordan speaking of john the word of god jesus just in case you were confused about who the word of god was came to him the word always comes to the truly spirit field so don't try to be spirit-filled without the word i know i'm beating this in but i'm going to beat it in i got a quote for that too brother braden says sometimes you preach so much to people about different things that people fail to get what point you is even making he says sometimes you just got to take one point and beat them with it something along those lines just hammer it in to make sure that they get it so sorry i'm thick headed so by default i automatically think everybody else is to get it the word always comes to the truly spirit field that is the evidence of being filled with the holy ghost did you notice that jesus said the world could not receive the holy ghost well in this verse i just read neither could they receive the word why because the word and the spirit are one i want you to note very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth now again we can put a self-interpretation to what the truth is but we can't do that because he's already told us what the truth is the manifestation for this hour is christ in the form of his bride the fullness of the word in you he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of god for your age evidence has to do with receiving the word in corinthians first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things i have re that i have wrote unto you are the commandments of the lord now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what god's prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order allow it to be as simple as he makes it paul had to say to those things who claimed another paul had to say to those who claimed another revelation what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth or the word but to receive the truth or the word and to believe and obey it you say well where's brother branham getting all of this from what's he basing his doctrine on first peter 1 verse 22 seeing you have purified your souls where are you born again at you're born again in your soul seeing that you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of incorruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so if you are here seeking the baptism of the holy spirit seeking the token seeking the new birth i would simply tell you seek the true word of god acknowledge it and follow it that is what the prophet taught us that is what the scripture teaches us the scripture does not teach us that we are saved or born again by any other experience the scripture teaches us we are born again by receiving the word of god 1965 christ is revealed in his own word brother branham says today so confused about the evidence of the holy ghost has anybody in their lifetime seen confusion about the evidence of the holy ghost okay like three of you have so confused about the evidence of the holy ghost and so forth satan can impersonate any kind of gift that god has got what's he linking to that confusion gifts gifts and manifestations is what brings that confusion satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that god has got but he cannot bring that word word by word so now he exposes what the confusion is and he tells us how to fix the confusion if you're confused about the evidence of the holy ghost it's possibly because you've seen some type of manifestation of a gift and you thought that was it other than it simply being the word upon word upon word in your life so if you want to do away with the confusion just get back to the word the word for your hour the fullness of the word displayed in the individual that's where he failed in the garden that's where he always failed that's where them tapes on the false anointed ones see where he's going that's where them that tape on the false anointed ones or anointed ones they can be anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still a devil he said it not me he's not pulling any punches now preach the gospel and still be a devil what gospel are they preaching they can't be preaching the full word of god or they wouldn't be a devil they're preaching a slight deviation and i'm making the new birth something that it's not calling jesus on the scene he says we need a book of acts again but the only way you'll do it is to get back to the bible many wants a book of acts how many wants manifestations and gifts and a book of acts he says the only way you'll produce that is if you get back to the bible if you get back to the word see i fear sometimes that we're seeking things that are not evil that are not sinful they're actually of god and worthy of seeking but we're seeking the wrong thing in the wrong way we're seeking to produce something ourselves we're seeking a manifestation to produce within ourselves instead of seeking the word and allowing it to produce something so we're trying to get the cart before the horse he says get back to the bible and away from some of this hybrid religion you're a christian because you are born in the spirit of christ and the word of god lives in you i fear that that definition of the book of acts would differ from some of the definitions of the book of acts that i've heard taught because he's saying you want to get back to a book of acts we need a book of acts and then he says you're a christian because you're born of the spirit of god and the word of god lives in you see there's lots of things that go on in the book of acts and a lot of them are very dynamic and don't think for a second that i don't want those i want them i want them all i want more of them but what i don't want is all of them and miss the word of god living in me that is the main point of the book of acts remember the book of acts is based upon what peter had to say when he came out of the upper room and what peter had to say is this word of god right here is what you're seeing right here this word of god that you see in job that's what you're seeing right here that's the book of acts now as that progressed there was multitudes of manifestations from that but if they ever deviated away from the point of being able to say this right here that you see is this right here they've missed the book of acts here we are 2 000 years later and we can do the exact same thing spoken word is the original seed brother chad read this on wednesday but he was laying emphasis on another part which i'm glad because now i can read it and lay emphasis on another part says the only way we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the mind received the word he was speaking on keeping your the womb of your mind clear but i'm focusing on the principle of the new birth it says the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the mind received the word why have we tried every other way then and again i don't have to take your word for it saints i've seen this in my own lifetime and i don't like it i don't like it i don't like young people sincerely sinking something or old people for that matter sincerely sinking something and a false gospel being given to them why have we tried to reproduce the new birth some other way than what he told us to do if you want to be born again first in the womb of your mind receive the message of your hour don't seek another experience receiving the word of god for your age in the womb of your mind and having it go into your soul will produce any experience you're in need of you may act a thousand different ways and i don't care about how you act i'm concerned that you've had that experience of receiving the word of god in the womb of your mind and allowing it to drop into your soul that is the book of acts that will produce any experience and any manifestation and any gift that you have need of but we have tried to produce the holy spirit and the new birth however many ways outside of that outside of preaching the pure word of god as it was delivered to us he says first receive it in the mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life so if you're seeking the holy spirit i would ask you to examine what the holy spirit comes upon what channel is it going to come to you as i said before what is the spirit riding on the spirit of god the spirit of jesus christ only rides on one power and that is the word for your age if you're after the spirit of god in your life find the word of god for your age you'll receive it no way that it will fail there you are see that's what does it that's the real gospel teaching brother i believe if saint paul was standing today he'd teach the same thing i do in this hour what would he teach oh you all are wanting the baptism of the holy spirit receive the word for your hour he says that's the real gospel teaching again by default anything that's not that is the wrong gospel teaching the real gospel teaching of the baptism of the holy spirit is to receive the word for your hour and you can never receive the word for your hour if you do not first recognize who that word came through it's that simple praise god let's go to the book of revelation let's go to revelation chapter 4. we're going to nail this down if we haven't already and if i have already nailed it down then i'm going to clench it and if i've already clinched it then i'm going to nail the board nail the nail all the way through the board remember what we're after saints we're after a settled people brother branham says the spirit of teaching comes into the church to settle the church to establish the church let's allow him to settle us to establish us so how many would agree that brother branham taught john represents the bride how many would agree that john had a journey through the book of revelation how many would agree that we as an individual if we would do what john did in the book of revelation we would be manifesting the holy spirit in our life and for our age everybody with me so far let's take a scriptural identification of what we are to do as the bride of jesus christ demonstrating the fullness of the word in our age this is what the scripture says we will do john chapter 4 or i'm sorry revelation chapter 4. john meets an angel in the beginning of this book and this angel tells him to do certain things my other pre-qualification question is how many believes if we would do what the angel told john to do in the book of revelation we would be okay if we will do what the angel told john to do we'll be okay but he meets this angel in the beginning of the book of revelation and this angel tells him to do certain things and only certain things he doesn't tell him just go do whatever you want he doesn't leave things up to question or interpretation he's very specific he tells john to do certain things john is the type of the bride so now this angel is telling us as the bride to do certain things john chapter 4 verse 1 says after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither this is your first instruction from your angel doesn't say go seek something it doesn't say go pray and fast it doesn't say go to the altar it doesn't say weep and cry it says come up here brother branham says if we're going to do anything in the spirit of god we must first get in the spirit of god if we're going to understand anything we must first get in the spirit [Music] it should not be shocking that the first instructions that he comes and gives to his bride is get up here get up out of laodicea get up out brother branham says this is the scene-changing chapter he says in chapter four that the scene changes from earth and carnal things to heavenly spiritual things if you're going to get anywhere with god you have got to get out of your carnal understanding and your carnal sight and get into the spirit now this is where the trick lays because you can get into a spirit and be wrong but you have to get into the spirit and the only way that you're going to know that you've got into the correct spirit as it's if it is identified by your messenger so before you can hear the call to come up hither and go up hither to the proper place you first have to recognize who the angel is in chapter one in the beginning of the book remember john says this voice was behind him but he knew who the voice was which means he had already met the voice we've got to meet the voice we have to have an understanding who this is speaking to us but once we have that understanding and once we once we have that proper placement who this is now we can now we can have a liberty to do whatever he says because i'll just be quite frank with you once i've recognized who this angel is i don't care what he tells me to do i'm going to do it if he says as the old saying is go jump off a bridge i'm going to go jump off the bridge jump off a cliff i'm jumping off a cliff if he tells me to read and pray my reading uh read my bible and pray every day i might read and pray every day how dynamic is that once he tells me once i have the revelation of who this is i'm going to do what he says even if he says well just in my opinion i would do this it's good enough for me remember this is not just any angel saints this is the angel that god said i'm going to send you my angel i find it laughable and insulting when god's angel would come in his own humility and say well this is just my opinion and then we would just discount that like it's just a man's opinion it shows that we have no understanding of who this is this is god's angel that he sent what weight should we give to the mere opinion of god's angel that he would send to us i find it preposterous that we think we would have a better idea than that let's not be childish let's not be silly i think god that he sent me his angel that if nothing else he could just tell me his opinion of what he thinks god likes and how i should approach god and what he thinks god would be pleased in and that i don't have remember you only have two options you either take his opinion or you take your own opinion i i worry sometimes that we we don't acknowledge you know what that means when we say things like that the first instruction scripturally speaking that the angel gives us is come up here get out of the carnal get out of the natural come up here you can write these down if you want to i feel this is very important and i feel that if you will go back to this in times of unsettledness it'll be a comfort to you remember we're just going to target i'm just going to do what the angel told me to do because if we do that when we get to the end of this we you understand what i'm saying this and i say this respectfully we have an argument with god like if we get to the end of this and he cast us into outer darkness and we've done everything the angel told us to do god is a just god like i i feel that is the one and only argument we might have obviously if we do what he told us to do we're not going to be in that position but i'm just making that as a picture if we will just do what he told us to do because remember god is the one who vindicated this angel and if god so thoroughly vindicated this angel as he did to deceive me into doing something wrong i don't stand a chance saints because i'm just being honest with you i have no capability not to be deceived by this vindication that he provided i am totally and utterly deceived by it i have totally and utterly sold out to it i am either completely right or i am completely wrong he's the one who vindicated him the first instruction that he gives chapter 4. come up here into the spiritual realm let's go to chapter five chapter five verse five and one of the elders said unto me quit your crime i've already told you to get your eyes off of carnal things and get into the spirit why are you crying quit your whining i am the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and i have chosen you i've predestinated you i have sent you mine angel i have given you my full word quit crying because you don't know how you're going to pay your bills this week quit crying that your flesh is sick quit crying that you've got a problem weep not john weep not my bride quit going back into carnal things i've already told you come up hither a fruit of coming up hither is you're going to quit your whining that i'm going to quit my whining these are the instructions that john received come up hither quit your crime chapter 6 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were a noise of a thunder one of the four beasts sane come and see come up hither quit your crying come and see now compare this to what we read at the beginning in john 16 of what he the spirit of truth is to do i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now why because you have not come up hither how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come what is this spirit here in chapter 6 doing now come and see come and see he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and will show unto you but when the comforter is come whom i shall send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth with which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me the comforter what does a comforter do tells you to quit crying who do you think this is operating through the book of revelation talking to his bride he's doing the exact same things that jesus said the comforter and the spirit of truth also known as the holy ghost would do when he came chapter six he tells john come and see he tells them come and see come and see and another beast come and another one come and the voice speaks out of the myth says come and see come and see what chapter 6 is breaking to the seals he's revealing the tactics of the enemy come and see the tactics of the enemy so number one get out of the carnal into the spiritual quit your crying over carnal things i'm the lamb i've taken care of it now come and see the tactics of the enemy he proceeds through chapter six revealing the tactics it goes to chapter 10 probably our favorite chapter no doubt very familiar chapter 10 he says eat the book remember these are the specific instructions from god through his angel to you eat the book eat the book verse 8 then he goes to verse 11. say what the book said prophesy again eat the book and then say what the book said and if you have to use words eat the book manifest the book live the book prophesy again goes to chapter 11 verse 1 and there was given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar in them that worship therein he tells him stand up take what i have given you a rod remember who carries a rod a shepherd carries a rod and what is the rod it's a comfort to us is that not what david said thy rod and thy staff they comfort me he says take what i have given you and measure the temple of god he's not talking about a building what is the temple of god you are the temple of god so he says get up take the word i've given you and measure yourself if you're measuring up to the word of god these are your instructions but he goes a little bit farther because he says but the court the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not anything that's not dealing with you don't worry about measuring it you don't need to worry and figure out who the foolish virgin is you don't need to figure out who judas is he says take the word that i've given you measure yourself the rest of it don't worry about it i'll deal with that i know the measurements of that you come up hither quit crying look at the tactics of the evil one take the word that i've given you and measure yourself and don't worry about anybody else chapter 17 verse 1 and there came one of the seven angels which one that was you know i have my ideas which had the seven vials and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters come hither i'm going to show you what happens when somebody does not take what i've given them measure up to it and examine themselves this is the judgment this is what's going to happen to them when they fail to recognize the tactics of them of the enemy this is what route they go down chapter 21 verse 9. and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife come hither so that i can give you a proper understanding of who you are based upon the fact that you have left carnal things came into a heavenly realm that you have quit quit weeping about carnal things that you have a proper understanding of the of the enemy's tactics that you have measured yourself and measured up to the word of god and i've shown you the judgment of those that don't do that now because you've done this come here i'm going to give you a proper understanding of who you are i am going to show you you are my bride chapter 22 verse 9 the last thing that the angel says to him then saith he unto me let's go up to verse 8. and i john saw these things and heard them and when i heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant of the and of thy brethren and of the prophets and them which keep the sayings of this book worship god the last thing that this angel says to john is don't worship me i'm simply a son of man revealing the son of man i am simply a vessel that the holy spirit is working through don't worship the 16 elements that is here worship god you can see why that there would be an intuition to worship this vessel brother bryan says it's a honed razor's edge they asked him the question you know brother branham these people are saying you're jesus christ and so forth he says you know in one sense of the word they're a million miles off but in another sense of the word they're real close to it the 16 elements that made up the body of brother branham i do not worship but what was represented there and what was waived before me i have no issue saying i worship that remember worship is to bow yourself down before and i bow myself down to that word that was represented in that wave sheath even the times that the wave sheath demonstrated repentance i have no issue with that that is my absolute and that is my wave sheep that is my representation and the word that that vessel demonstrated i worship but the 16 elements that carried that i do not you say well that's split in hairs it is i would even say so much it's splitting atoms i cannot properly reveal that to you saints only god can some of you may walk out here and say that i worship him and i think he's deity i do not but i think he's everything but and i believe what was represented there and what was before us was deity nothing less it was the fullness of the word in a hybrid body and i worship and yield and give myself to the fullness of that word without worshiping that hybrid body i found it unique in this scripture here that he simply told john don't do that he didn't rebuke him and chastise him like what are you doing how in the world did you get to that point like you are totally out in left field no he just simply says john john no not me worship god i have a lot of grace for the people that walked in the days of brother branham that get confused about whether he was god or not because i'm just being honest with you saints if i was there and i was that close to and i've seen the things that they've seen i'm not sure which side of the fence i would be on if it's not by a supernatural revelation from god you will never be able to discern the two it is that close it is literally the fullness of god himself being manifested in a hybrid vessel and if he wouldn't come and declare to us that he was a hybrid vessel i can very easily see how someone would get confused i've got grace for that i'm not saying the right i'm not saying that they need to repent i'm not saying they don't need to repent and make that right and come to a proper understanding i'm just saying i'm going to do what the angel did i'm not going to rebuke them and i'm not going to chastise them and i'm not going to call them stupid and call them foolish virgin and call them heretics i'm just going to say no let's stick with what he taught us don't do that don't do that don't worship him worship god and i'll be shocked if the argument that they present back is not well god is the word and the word is what's being manifested here and i'll say you're right you're right but it's the word in fallen flesh so we cannot worship the flesh only the holy spirit can give you a proper understanding of that now after an hour i finally got to where i wanted to get to and that's where i finished up last time i read this quote out of the church age book if you allow me the courtesy just to go through this and make a couple points we'll close i'm not going to be able to finish i didn't expect to but this is what was really striking me so heavily during wednesday and it was where i had finished last time brother branham says if we are going to live as christians we have to be in his spirit if there is anything good that will come to me it has to be one revealed by the spirit two confirmed by the word and three made manifest by the results that it bears now i read that quote last time but i want to expound upon that he says as surely as john needed to be in the spirit to receive these tremendous revelations fresh from jesus we need to be in the spirit to understand the revelations that god has given to us to live by his word for it is the same spirit remember the three things that he said if there is anything good to come to me to you from god it has to meet three qualifications it has to be revealed by god's spirit it has to be confirmed by god's word and it has to be made it has to be made manifest in your life and proven by the results that it bears that's how we know it's from god but this leaves us in a conundrum because what can you or i do to start this process moving remember the process is something has to be revealed by the spirit then confirmed by the word then made manifest in your life so do you want the full word of god manifest in your life do you want everything that you do to be confirmed by the word those two can only happen if it's first revealed to you by the spirit now i want somebody to come up here and tell me the secret to making the spirit reveal something to you you and i have no capacity whatsoever in any figment of our imagination to make god do anything for us we have no capacity to make this process start so we can't get to the end of it which is our desire it's my desire i want the fullness of the word made manifest in my life but according to the prophet the only way that process can take place is if first the spirit comes and reveals something to me but i have no capability to make the spirit do that it doesn't say if you pray for three days or if you fast for a week or if you sell all your lands and all your it doesn't give me any qualifications for this if it did i would do it and i have no doubt that if it did as crazy and as ludicrous as it would be we would all do it we would do it is that our is that not our hearts cry and our hearts prayer every day lord just show me what you want me to do i'll do it i don't care what it is if you'll just show me i'll do it but we have no requirements from the angel to make this process start working because the angel knows there are no requirements because if there were requirements it would completely do away with the grace of god to you and me think about it if there was a list of 27 requirements and we went and did all of them it does away with the grace of god because now it's requirements that we can read and we can do and now anybody can make their way in because there's a list of requirements and also it would make our salvation based upon works of our own doing i saw this list i chose to do it and i did it now god you're obligated to do this i know this is so simple and this is so elementary but if we'll really grasp this principle it will bring a settledness to us face the fact that if god don't do something for you you're lost there is nothing you can do work wise prayer wise obedience wise fasting wise to make god move on your behalf so quit relax quit worrying about it relax it doesn't do you any good to get all worked up in your spirit realm about this because at the end of the day there's nothing you can do about it to begin with so if the devil is coming and an evil spirit maybe a mockery holy spirit would come to you and tell you if you would just do this more if you were a better boy if you hadn't done that three days ago or if you wouldn't have looked at that woman at walmart cross side like you did and said then maybe god would move on your behalf no it doesn't matter how good you are i can't even believe i'm saying this i'm supposed to tell you to repent or perish it doesn't matter saints it does not matter how good you are there is no capability that you have within yourself to pull the spirit down and reveal something to you and just in case you think i was making this up let me read you a quote 1962 communion brother branham says if god ever sends his power to his church it'll be by his grace it won't be the obedience of the people see you can do everything right and god's still not obligated to move on your behalf in isaiah in the 40th chapter it says how to cry to jerus jerusalem that her warfare was over yet she was guilty of idolatry but it was god's grace that was sending it god sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our merits so when the evil spirit comes by telling you to have more merits or to do more good works or to do something to get the spirit to move in your life you should be able to now recognize that automatically as an evil spirit now a spirit that comes to you and tells you to line up with the word of god is not an evil spirit but a spirit that comes to you and tells you to line up with the word of god so that the spirit will move in your life is an evil spirit because it's taking the proper application and telling you you're going to get something that is outside of the grace of god we should obey the word of god we should pray we should fast we should do all of those things we should try to be a good boy with the understanding that if god doesn't do something in his grace for me i'm still lost amen if there is anything good to come to me by god it has to first be revealed by the spirit and if it doesn't there's no way we can confirm it by the word and there's no way it's going to manifest itself in our life we are at the total mercy of god himself to come and pick us up that is why in john in revelation chapter 4 the first thing that he says is come here come here without an invitation to come into the heavenly realm you can't come into the heavenly realm with an invitation you may go boldly if god ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace it won't be the obedience of the people if god sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our merits musicians if you'll come you say well that sounds good i like that there's a catch it has to be revealed by the spirit second it has to be confirmed by the word thirdly it has to be manifest in our lives to prove that it's the true word of god but we have no capability focus now because we have no capability to make the spirit move but brother branham goes farther in the church age book and he makes a comment we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that god works with he moves by his spirit that's what we're after right because remember that's what starts the process rolling he moves by his spirit and that moving of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word no true believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of god so is it by grace that the spirit has to move in our lives absolutely no issues there but in order to even stand a chance for this spirit to move in our life the prophet said that that spirit will only move in a life that is consecrated to the word of god this is why wednesday struck me so profoundly because i knew the direction that i was going next time i ministered i didn't know it was going to be today but i knew whenever it was and he's ministering on the key to making the spirit move he wasn't just talking about your phone saints the spirit the capability for us to come to the fullness of the word in our vessels the process for that is for the spirit to reveal something to us confirm it into its word and then manifest it in us remember that's the end-all be-all like when we come to the fullness of the word and our vessels we're out of here but the process for that has to start with the moving of the spirit and we can't do anything to force that spirit to move but in order to even stand a chance for it to move in for it to begin that process we have to keep ourself consecrated to the word of god the spirit moves only in a life consecrated to the word and we cannot do that if we're distracted by everything else as he said not sinful things we're beyond that saints i feel we're beyond that that's not the tactics the devil is going to use the devil is going to use righteous things to get us distracted and get us to deviate our lives away from being solely consecrated to the word now there is the possibility there is the possibility that you can totally consecrate yourself to the word as best as you know how even obedience to the word as best as you know how and the spirit will not move in your life and reveal anything to you there is that possibility because we cannot force god to do anything but the point is if you have a desire for that to be in your life remember the principle our prophet taught us before that desire can be there god made a way for that desire so if we have that desire and we know the only way that we can even stand a chance for that desire to manifest itself in our life is to keep ourselves solely and singularly focused and consecrated to the pure word of god and obedience to it why would we not want to do that and i would say it may sound hard but i would say if we are declaring that the only thing that we want out of life is for the fullness of the word to be made manifest in our vessels the last phase of that process but yet we are not solely and totally consecrated to the word of god in our daily lives we're not telling the truth because remember the last phase is the manifestation in our life and you can scream and shout and cry all you want that you want that manifestation in your life but if you and i are not going to do the first thing and the only thing that we can do to even stand a chance to get to that point we're preaching another gospel we're not being honest with ourselves and we're not being honest with the truth the capacity to keep our spirit realm clear from carnal earthly distractions is the first thing we must do to further the plan of god it is so simple it is so elementary it is so basic the scripture calls it that's your reasonable service but it is the hardest thing that me and you fight on a daily basis i'm not preaching at you now i'm preaching with you i'm preaching to myself it's the same battle i fight saints don't think i don't have a million and one things to do don't i understand you have a million and one things to do i'm not saying you're not busy i'm not saying i'm not busy i'm not trying to make this life something that it's not i'm just saying at some point in time we've got to come to realization to quit making excuses and realize if we want the spirit of god to move the only thing that i can do is consecrate myself solely and singularly to the word of god and then i can expect him to reveal something to me then i can expect to confirm that in his word and then i can expect him to manifest that and prove that in my life let's stand together that is the only thing that we can do that is the only possibility that we have to further the kingdom of god that is the working of the holy spirit so we're seeking the holy spirit we're seeking the new birth we're seeking the token but now we have an understanding of what it is and what it will do because i assure you a mockery holy spirit will do a lot of things but the one thing that it won't do is consecrate your daily life to the word of god only by perchance god might want to reveal something to you and i'll just drop this in on a personal note you take it for what it's worth but i'm going to ask you to try something and if it don't work you throw it in a garbage can but as you're pursuing and seeking and concentrating yourself daily to the word of god asking god to reveal something to you in the spirit to confirm by his word and make manifest in your life don't ask in and of for yourself ask for your brothers and your sisters can god reveal something to you to help you absolutely but we're done with one man ministries we are in a day in an age that the bride is to be the final voice to the final age we are in the day in an age to where god is wanting to pick up you the bride and speak the words of life to somebody else the bride that is the voice he's wanting to use we have the pure word of god as delivered to us by our prophet but there are specific daily instances of what we need to do in our lives what i would say carnal things job situations family situations decisions that have to be made health decisions do you understand what i'm saying there's specific things that we can't go read and find a quote that says on monday the 15th or whatever it is 16th you need to do this you need to make this decision about this situation but that's why there is a final voice to a final age on earth now that god is wanting to move through and that's just a challenge to you when you're seeking seek for yourself i'm not telling you not to i'm greedy when it comes to the things of god and i'm going to seek for myself but at the end of that i'm going to spend time seeking as i'm consecrating myself to the word of god and the spirit of god on a daily basis for the spirit to move and reveal something to me i want to designate a time period that he can speak to me about a situation that will help my brother and sister that won't even help me at all that may actually be a burden to me but i'll ask you if god is wanting to personally and specifically speak to an individual what voice is he going to use in this day and age he can use any voice i've seen him do it in my own life i've had sinner people blatant center people say something to me to prick my heart god can do whatever he wants to do and he will do what he needs to do i'm just saying if we want to farther the program of god and be operating in the spirit should not we allow god and if we really believe that we are the voice to the final age and we are the vessels that he's moving through should we not designate ourself a time period that maybe god wants to use me to speak to my brother and sister i challenge you to do that i ask you to do that if we want to see god move in our midst we have to come the way god wants to move and god may do it you may see dynamics like you have never seen before there may be prophecies there may be healings there may be gifts rise up like we have never seen it may be so dynamic it will blow your mind there is the possibility though it will be so dynamic that it will be as simple as you are simply anointed to read something out of the message and your brother asks you a question about it the next day so let's not self-interpret what dynamic is let's allow him to express himself as dynamic as he wants to express himself and remember no true believer if you'll play something softly please i promise i'm closing no true believer is any stronger spiritually healthy and alive than his knowledge of you're not going to get the knowledge if you don't eat the book don't expect to have the knowledge of god if you don't read the message in the bible and don't expect to be strong spiritually healthy and alive if you don't eat the book don't expect it you're not going to be and alive then his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of god so do not expect to be strong spiritually healthy or alive if you don't eat the book and then do what the book says and don't expect to have a proper understanding of what that book is trying to tell you if you have not kept your mind free from carnal things and came up hither and have dedicated and consecrated yourself solely to the word of god that's the only chance we have saints and even then it's not a guarantee but that's the only chance we have to make the holy spirit move do we have an understanding i'm going to stop let's pray precious lord jesus we thank you for this time that you've allowed us to be together lord and father i've been lengthy and i've repeated myself a lot lord but i prayed that you would just take this burden that i have and this direction that i feel to go and that you would reveal it to the people lord lord that the purpose of this being ministered would come to fruition and that purpose would be individuals and a group of believers that are steadfast and solid and stabilized on who we are and what our purpose is lord that we would not be tossed to and fro and wonder whether we're going to make it or if we're going to make it but that we would come to a proper understanding that we've already made it lord and that you would build upon that revelation from glory to glory to glory but lord if we have not first answered that question we can build as high as we want and it's going to come crumbling down but father i pray as we have went back to a scriptural teaching of this baptism of your spirit of this new birth as brought to us by your prophet as we have went back to that and and focused on that may we relax and allow it to be as he taught it to his father and may we move forward with boldness lord may we recognize our position in christ may we do as the angel told john and come and see the tactics of the imminent enemy may we may we take the rod of this word and measure ourself individually to make sure that we are meeting and matching that word we just consecrate ourselves to you lord we give you our this day we pray that you would be with the remainder of this service as we would worship you father in song and praise may you just move upon our hearts lord and establish an unsettledness and lord if there would be any here who have not had that experience of the new birth who have not completely died out to themselves and given over to your word and your spirit i pray that they would do so now lord and if those if there are those here that are confused and not recognize what they have done and what they have received may you settle that in their hearts here this morning may we go forth as your bride with our heads held high lord not in arrogance lord but in boldness knowing who we are and where we stand and may we do as you told us in chapter 10 prophesy again lord that another might be saved that another eagle out there somewhere lord would be able to come to their position and to recognize who they are we just give you this day lord we would pray for the kids service this afternoon we pray that your anointing would be there and be supernatural or that you would just move on our youth lord reveal yourself to them father we just commit all to you in the name of the lord jesus christ the bride says amen god bless you saints thank you for bearing with me let's sing brother ben as our pastor would come we worship [Music] oh we [Music] we have heard your word and felt your presence too in [Music] amen i tell you friends we're all in the same spot whether you've been serving god for a month or you've been serving god for 30 years you still need god to reveal the next steps amen all that god has done for us in the past and the many things and experiences we had is just encouragement lessons we've learned to carry us into the next step but without him where do we go without him where we place our foot without him which direction we take when it comes to the end of it brother branham was so good at doing this he put us all in the same place we're all children of god and we need to be led by the spirit of god and how do we do that we now learn we know the only thing that i can do is consecrate myself to this word and trust that he'll do the rest i can't make him move but i trust he will he told me in his word he would i believe he will all i can do is what he's asked me to do is believe him act on his word obey it stand on it have trust and faith that god will lead he's done it this far why would he stop now amen whether you preach the gospel whether you're a teenager whether you have an office in the church you don't we're all in the same place we're utterly dependent on god to reveal to us from the spirit what we should do and i say what a place to be utterly completely dependent on him amen god is good let's pray for one another that god will continue to keep us in his hand and lead us step by step i appreciate the instruction we got i appreciate the subtleness that comes from just taking god at his word and believing that if he said it it's the truth i can rest my soul upon it i don't need what somebody else told me i don't need what somebody else has encouraged me to do or say or experience to have if i can see it in the word the prophet showed it to us in the word we can see in the scriptures i can rest my soul on that word and have rest and we can never move forward into the program of god until we first take him out of his word and believe it if we're are we always going around the same starting line and never getting down the road amen what a trick the devil has pulled on us let's take him at his word and say god i believe you now lead me i believe you'll do what you said you will do i take your word i believe god everything you've told me but help me know what step to take next amen you know brother branham come to the end of his ministry and he had a vision and in the vision he was told something he said in order to do this you must be more sincere and boy every time i hear that it does something to me because i know i'll stand here and tell you to confess before everybody i know that i must be more sincere am i sincere yes do i love the lord yes have i consecrated my life to him yes but i must be more sincere than i am today there's more for me to grow in there's more consecration there's more of my life to give up there's more of my ideas to drop there's more of my own desires to forsake there's more i must be more consecrated i must mean more sincere i know you feel the same way but who who put the desire in us to give him more who put the desire in us when you say there's more ground to gain there's more death to self there's more consecration but there's something inside that says that's the only thing i really want amen that's all i really want i really want to give him all i really want to consecrate more i really want to surrender more is that your prayer you really want to give him more amen let's just bow our heads together and commit together to give him more lord jesus we thank you father we thank you for the word we've heard we thank you for the truth that we're standing upon god you sent a sure word to us and you gave us a such a vindication of that ministry lord that we could take such comfort in knowing that you gave us the truth lord not a man's ideas not concepts or denominations but you brought us back to the full truth of your full word and god we can rest in that knowing lord that you wouldn't deceive us you wouldn't lead us astray but you led us to the truth lord god you put something inside of us that says yea and amen to that word and a desire lord to consecrate ourselves to that word lord it's all you doing the work you gave the word you've indicated the word you drew us to the word you gave us a desire to surrender to the word it's all yukon god we just desire now to consecrate more of ourselves to obey lord those commandments that were given like they were given to john we want to leave the carnal behind lord we want to recognize what you've done for us we want to feed on this word we want to prophesy again lord we want to measure ourselves by the word this is what our desire is because you put it in us to want these things i pray god that you'd help us to lay down every hindrance and every barrier anything that we can do lord give us the strength to do it and for the rest of it that we have no power to do i pray you give a power lord that you would supply lord the ability that we might continue to walk in your will and grow to be all that you want us to be lord i pray you have blessed this word that's wet forth may it find fruit lord may i find a place in our souls and may it bear fruit lord much fruit that we might live this life you've called us to live in this hour god it's a high calling but it's your calling it's it's an hour of great manifestation but lord you've predetermined the vessels that will be here in that hour and you chose that they will manifest this life and lord i believe it's the truth god i just want to give myself afresh to you help us lord to surrender more help us to give up more of the world and take more of your word and help us lord as you said to your disciples when you were on earth you prayed you said i sanctify myself for their sakes lord help us to sanctify and consecrate ourselves for the one next to us for one another let us live a dedicated life god we love you we ask that you would take us and do with us lord more than we could ever do with ourselves for we're placing ourselves in your hand we're saying we have no way without you now come holy spirit and take control of our lives we love you father we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] amen friends this is the hour for full manifestation not partial but full and we're not going to get there just continuing to circle the same circles but it's going to take another step and another step in another step and i thank god he's there every step of the way saying okay one more step one more step one more step praise god sing brother ben and i just want to thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done to deserve such glory
