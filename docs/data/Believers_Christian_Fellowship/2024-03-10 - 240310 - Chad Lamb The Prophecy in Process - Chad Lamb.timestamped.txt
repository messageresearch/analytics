[18:10] mention it but uh not this past Thursday
[18:15] wait Sunday but the previous Thursday I
[18:18] went over to Holmes County to do the
[18:19] Bible study the church age book Bible
[18:21] study for the uh Brethren over there and
[18:25] during that uh Bible study um brother
[18:28] Ben Yoder brother Levi Yoda's brother
[18:31] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[18:32] Jesus Christ and so I know the Lord had
[18:35] been dealing with him for a long time on
[18:37] that and different ones had talked to
[18:38] him about it and he called me on Tuesday
[18:41] before and let me know that uh he wanted
[18:43] to be baptized he said if if that's all
[18:45] right with you and I said oh my goodness
[18:48] that's all right with me I've been
[18:49] praying for this for months you know and
[18:52] um and uh when I got there on Thursday
[18:55] we did the baptism before the Bible
[18:57] study when I got out there to the
[18:58] baptism after he was baptized his wife
[19:01] was right behind him and they got
[19:02] baptized together so the Lord's really
[19:05] blessed them over there and we want to
[19:07] continue to hold them up in prayer and
[19:10] thank God for all that he's doing it's
[19:14] exciting I'm telling you it's exciting
[19:16] to see people have a love for the word
[19:18] and God's still seeking out a sheep and
[19:20] pulling them to himself it's such a
[19:22] thrill just to witness it and so I thank
[19:24] God for that all right let's Stand
[19:27] Together
[19:29] so there'll be a lot happening over the
[19:30] next two weeks different Brothers
[19:32] ministering in different places a lot
[19:34] happening here and a lot of good things
[19:36] happening and I thank God for that I
[19:38] love to I love to be uh I love to be
[19:42] part of what God's doing and I'm so
[19:43] thankful he lets us share in what he's
[19:46] doing he could certainly do it without
[19:48] us he could use somebody else but I'm so
[19:50] thankful he lets us have a part you know
[19:53] and witness what he's doing cuz it's a
[19:54] thrill for us uh before we go into the
[19:57] scripture reading
[19:59] also want to give you an update on
[20:00] brother Tim erant um I've been uh
[20:02] checking with him and talking to Janet
[20:04] and visiting him he's still in the
[20:06] hospital at St Reid as he had a a mild
[20:08] stroke and he's still suffering the
[20:10] effects of that stroke um and so just
[20:13] keep praying for him that God will give
[20:15] him a full recovery and even bring him
[20:17] back to more strength than he had before
[20:19] the stroke and that God will really
[20:21] bless him and bless Sister Janet I know
[20:23] it's a lot of pressure for her and the
[20:25] family and I know it's a difficult time
[20:27] but he's he's uh he's doing well he's
[20:30] improving every day he's improving but
[20:33] he still is having trouble communicating
[20:35] he's having trouble really expressing
[20:37] himself he he knows where he's at he
[20:39] knows what he's doing like he's he's
[20:40] fully aware but sometimes he has hard
[20:42] time getting the words out and so there
[20:45] we really want to see God restore him
[20:47] completely once they know he's
[20:49] completely medically stable they want to
[20:50] move him over to delphus to Van Crest
[20:52] Nursing Facility for Rehab so I know he
[20:55] would appreciate visits I know they
[20:57] would appreciate any word of
[20:58] encouragement that you can give at this
[21:00] time and I know they certainly are
[21:02] coveting your prayers so let's just
[21:04] remember our brother as he's recovering
[21:05] he's recovering but we want God to we
[21:08] really want God to give him a full
[21:10] strength full recovery and even more
[21:12] than he had
[21:14] before also last night I got a call uh
[21:17] late into the night um while I was still
[21:21] here studying that um uh Young Brother
[21:25] Derek seil was Ill he wasn't feeling
[21:27] well last evening
[21:28] uh right as he went to bed and he was he
[21:30] was sick it looked like maybe he had a
[21:32] stomach bug or something was was coming
[21:34] on and and uh as he as he went to get
[21:37] sick again he called for his mom and
[21:39] when she went in from all that they can
[21:40] tell it appears like he had a some sort
[21:43] of seizure he had an episode where he
[21:45] just got really stiff and he was
[21:47] unresponsive for maybe a minute and then
[21:50] when he came to he didn't have any
[21:52] movement he couldn't move his fingers in
[21:53] his left hand he had some numbness in
[21:55] his feet so they took him to the
[21:57] hospital last night and we went over
[21:58] there and prayed with him in the
[22:00] hospital but by the time I got there to
[22:02] the hospital he was already feeling much
[22:03] better so he still has some of the
[22:06] symptoms from the stomach bug or flu or
[22:07] whatever but he's feeling much better
[22:10] he's thinking more clearly they had the
[22:12] they did a CT scan and they did blood
[22:14] work and everything came back good the
[22:16] CT scan was good the blood work was good
[22:18] there was one level that was elevated
[22:21] indicating that he did have a seizure so
[22:23] they want him to do a follow-up visit
[22:25] with children's hospital but we just
[22:27] want we just want to pray that the
[22:29] follow-up visit is a confirmation
[22:31] there's nothing wrong and that God has
[22:33] healed him so it appears that the
[22:35] devil's tried to take advantage of a
[22:37] weakness through illness or something
[22:39] that was going on in his body but we're
[22:41] going to resist the devil and if you
[22:43] resist the devil he shall flee so
[22:45] whatever he was trying to do whatever
[22:46] inroads he was trying to make and
[22:48] whatever he was using we're going to
[22:49] stand together and resist that and
[22:52] believe that that God will give him a
[22:54] full restoration of full health and that
[22:57] his check up will be a confirmation that
[23:00] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[23:03] and forever
[23:05] amen praise God just before we read the
[23:08] Bible let's bow our heads together and
[23:10] pray dear heavenly father we thank you
[23:13] God for all that we see you doing Lord

[24:31] would take away all the effects of the
[24:33] stroke and that youd bring him back to a
[24:35] greater strength than he had before for
[24:37] he's trusting in you and we're believing
[24:39] Lord that you're the same yesterday

[24:43] the family strengthen them and

[25:12] manifest God whatever symptoms are
[25:14] remaining of whatever illness or
[25:16] sickness was underlying I pray that you
[25:18] take them all away that you heal his
[25:20] body completely and when they go for the
[25:22] followup visit Lord may may another
[25:24] testimony come forth Lord that you're a
[25:26] Healer and you're a deliver and whatever
[25:28] the devil attempted to do he was he was
[25:31] thed once again by the blood of Jesus
[25:34] Christ by the stripes that you bore for
[25:36] our healing Lord we just we purchased
[25:39] for us healing and we just believe in it
[25:41] we hold on to it and I pray that you'd
[25:43] bless there Lord bless us now as we look
[25:46] into your word I pray God that your
[25:48] inspiration would fall upon this vessel
[25:50] and that you would speak Lord that it
[25:52] wouldn't be the ability of a man because
[25:54] that is a failure to begin with but Lord
[25:57] May may you come and speak may you come
[25:59] and break the bread of life may you come
[26:01] and give us eyes Saab that we might see
[26:04] and a heart that we might perceive all
[26:05] that you're doing for us help us Lord to
[26:08] walk the path that you've laid for
[26:11] us and help us to do so with faith God
[26:14] we love you we ask your blessing in
[26:16] Jesus Christ's name
[26:19] amen just want to say God bless you all
[26:22] those that are visiting and especially
[26:24] to brother Benjamin LA and his wife
[26:26] they're here visiting for from Arizona
[26:28] visiting his brother Aaron God bless you
[26:30] it's good to have you here in the
[26:31] service they've got to go back I believe
[26:33] on Tuesday right Wednesday so it's just
[26:35] a short visit but it was good to see
[26:38] them once again let's look at Isaiah
[26:40] chapter
[26:43] 7 and verse
[26:49] 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give
[26:52] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[26:54] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[26:57] his name name Emanuel man God bless you
[27:00] as you take your
[27:05] seats I don't know if you'll remember
[27:08] but excuse me a couple weeks ago I come
[27:11] to the pull pit and told you that I had
[27:13] had a strange night before that I had a
[27:15] message prepared and I had worked it all
[27:17] out and and then all of a sudden
[27:19] everything changed about 8:30 or
[27:21] whatever well the message I was working
[27:23] on was the one I hop that I can Preach
[27:25] Today I'm planning on it anyway but who
[27:27] knows what will happen amen we've
[27:29] learned to take nothing for granted but
[27:31] as a as a subject I'd like to look at
[27:34] the prophecy and
[27:36] process the prophecy in process I've got
[27:38] a PowerPoint that I'll go to and uh in
[27:41] just a minute because there's several
[27:42] quotes that I want to read together and
[27:44] I put them on the overhead so we can go
[27:45] quickly because I want us to look at it
[27:47] together and I don't want to get bogged
[27:49] down in it but I want to look at this
[27:51] this um if I could say the prophecy and
[27:53] process I want to look at it as a as a
[27:55] subject or as a uh a maybe a principle
[27:58] that's that's what I want to say and
[28:00] then see if we can glean something out
[28:02] of that for ourselves for today so when
[28:05] we look at Isaiah chapter 7 there's a
[28:09] prophecy that's given Isaiah is now the
[28:11] mouthpiece of God and he's laying down a
[28:13] prophecy that a virgin shall conceive
[28:16] and he says uh uh the Lord himself shall
[28:19] give you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[28:21] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[28:23] his name Emmanuel now let's go to Luke
[28:26] chap 1 take
[28:38] together Luke chapter
[28:47] 1 Luke 1 and verse 26 let's begin in
[28:50] verse
[28:53] 26 and in the sixth month the angel
[28:56] Gabriel was sent from God brought into a
[28:57] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[29:00] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[29:02] Joseph of the House of David and the
[29:05] Virgin the virgin's name was Mary and
[29:07] the angel came in unto her and said hail
[29:09] Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with
[29:11] thee blessed art thou among women and
[29:14] when she saw him she was troubled at the
[29:16] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[29:18] of salutation this should be and the
[29:20] angel said unto her fear not Mary for
[29:21] thou has found favor with God and behold
[29:24] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[29:25] bring forth a son and shalt call his
[29:27] name Jesus he shall be great and shall
[29:30] be called the son of the highest and the
[29:32] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[29:34] of his father David and he shall reign
[29:36] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[29:38] his kingdom there shall be no end then
[29:40] said Mary unto the angel how shall this
[29:42] be seeing I know not a man and the angel
[29:44] answered and said unto her the Holy
[29:46] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[29:48] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[29:50] therefore also that Holy thing which
[29:52] shall be born in thee shall be called
[29:53] The Son of God so here we see the time
[29:57] of fulfillment of the prophecy has come
[29:59] more than 700 years before Isaiah had
[30:02] declared a virgin shall conceive and now
[30:05] now it comes time for the prophecy to
[30:08] move from just a prophecy into
[30:10] manifested word the word was going to
[30:12] come into a manifestation and the word
[30:15] always comes to manifestation in
[30:17] flesh and so Mary was going to be the
[30:19] flesh that this word was going to
[30:21] manifest in and so now we see that the
[30:24] angel Gabriel comes to her and tells her
[30:26] that that she's highly favored that it's
[30:28] the time of the prophecy and she's going
[30:31] to conceive in her wound and she says
[30:32] how will this be because I don't know a
[30:34] man and and he says it's going to be the
[30:36] Holy Ghost now he's coming and he's
[30:38] showing her it's going to be a virgin
[30:40] conception amen it's going to be an
[30:42] Immaculate Conception you it's not going
[30:44] to involve a man because you're the
[30:46] Virgin because this is the prophecy
[30:48] because this is the
[30:49] time so now when it comes time
[30:52] everything's confirmed and she conceives
[30:55] in her wound by the Holy Ghost no man
[30:57] involved she there's a virgin conception
[30:59] it says a virgin shall conceive so now
[31:02] she's carrying around amen the prophecy
[31:05] in manifestation in
[31:09] her amen we know that she runs to
[31:12] Elizabeth and she gives a salutation to
[31:14] Elizabeth and and while she's speaking
[31:16] to Elizabeth amen Elizabeth also has a
[31:19] word of Prophecy in her and that is the
[31:22] Forerunner John the Baptist of Malachi 3
[31:25] amen that was prophesied to come is now
[31:27] inside of her amen but she's got the
[31:29] word inside of her Mary's got the word
[31:31] inside of her but the word inside of
[31:34] Elizabeth is laying there in a dormant
[31:36] state it doesn't it's not kicking it's
[31:37] not moving and you know brother Brandon
[31:39] saying that she was getting nervous it
[31:41] was now six months and she hadn't felt
[31:43] any life amen any sign of life and so
[31:46] now Mary comes because Mary is living in
[31:48] the prophecy she's the Living Word she's
[31:50] the manifested
[31:52] word what word is she a virgin shall
[31:55] conceive she's the Virgin and the
[31:56] concept ceptions inside of her she is
[31:58] the manifested word for that hour and
[32:01] she comes to another woman that's
[32:02] ordained to be the manifested word for
[32:04] that hour that has a seed of life that
[32:07] has amen a word inside of her laying
[32:09] dormant but when she testifies and
[32:11] speaks the name that was given to her of
[32:13] Jesus Christ all of the sudden that word
[32:16] inside of her leapt and started kicking
[32:18] and started moving amen why because the
[32:20] manifested word goes from one to the
[32:22] other to the other to the
[32:25] other and now the both they're both
[32:28] living out
[32:31] prophecy Elizabeth is living out
[32:33] prophecy cuz a forerunner has to come
[32:35] and she's carrying the Forerunner John
[32:37] the Baptist is born and and then you
[32:39] know things happen and and brother R
[32:41] tells us history shows that that he had
[32:42] older parents and they deceased and he
[32:44] went to the Wilderness and he didn't
[32:46] have any formal training and he Stomps
[32:48] out and he starts baptizing and and at
[32:50] the same time Jesus is born and he lives
[32:52] in an obscure Corner uh uh uh in Israel
[32:55] there and he's not really noticed or
[32:57] known and there's things happening all
[32:59] over the
[33:00] place but when you look at the
[33:04] prophecy prophecy said a virgin shall
[33:06] conceive and bring forth a son and his
[33:10] name shall be Emmanuel which is god with
[33:13] us
[33:14] so when you look at
[33:17] it Mary when the angel comes to Mary he
[33:23] opens the prophecy to
[33:25] her and it begins
[33:29] and she
[33:30] conceives and then the question
[33:33] is is that the Fulfillment of the
[33:37] prophecy it's an interesting
[33:39] question because the answer is yes and
[33:43] the answer is also
[33:46] no because the prophecy is a virgin
[33:48] shall conceive yes and bear a
[33:52] son but Jesus hadn't been born yet so
[33:56] for that 10 month period where were we
[33:59] were we in the prophecy is the prophecy
[34:01] fulfilled is the prophecy not fulfilled
[34:03] I can you say the prophecy is fulfilled
[34:05] can you say this is can you say this is
[34:06] Isaiah 7:14 or
[34:10] not oh I hope you're you're start
[34:13] letting it sink in can you say this is
[34:15] Isaiah 7 74 yeah you absolutely you can
[34:18] say this is the Fulfillment of Isaiah 14
[34:20] but yet there's more in the prophecy to
[34:23] be fulfilled that doesn't mean she's not
[34:25] in the prophecy that doesn't mean the
[34:26] prophe is not fulfilled but there's more
[34:28] to develop there's more to be fulfilled
[34:31] as time goes on and for that period of
[34:33] time amen the the the prophecy was just
[34:36] blooming amen it was growing and and it
[34:39] was now coming into fulfillment and
[34:41] every part of the prophecy would come
[34:43] into full fulfillment but never could
[34:46] you say that's not the prophecy this
[34:48] isn't right that's not what Isaiah
[34:51] said cuz the minute you deny that she
[34:54] was in the prophecy and the prophecy was
[34:56] fulfilled in her you were
[34:58] wrong to deny it would be wrong because
[35:01] it was absolutely right but but then
[35:04] also to say this is it and there's
[35:05] nothing more to come this is the end of
[35:07] it that would be wrong because there has
[35:09] to be a son that's born and he has to be
[35:11] Emanuel which is God With Us and he's
[35:13] going to manifest that God was with us
[35:16] so even in part of the prophecy was not
[35:19] just the birth of Jesus but also the
[35:21] manifestation that God was with us and
[35:24] that took place during his ministry amen
[35:27] even even he didn't even enter the
[35:28] ministry publicly until he was 30 years
[35:31] old and he come to the baptism at Jordan
[35:33] and then he began to go about doing
[35:35] signs and wonders and miracles and
[35:37] manifesting that he was Emanuel that
[35:39] this really is God With Us the fullness
[35:42] of the godhead
[35:44] bodily was in him it was God working in
[35:48] him reconciling the world to so so so
[35:51] when you look at this
[35:54] prophecy it's interesting to me the
[35:58] Bible just keeps getting more and more
[36:00] interesting to
[36:01] me because we we we as human beings we
[36:06] we do things mentally sometimes that
[36:09] we're not even aware of and and we we we
[36:12] try to figure things out in in some ways
[36:14] we I'd say it this way we want to
[36:17] compartmentalize everything yes because
[36:20] we don't like open-ended things we don't
[36:22] like things that are not resolved that's
[36:24] just naturally we don't like things that
[36:25] are not resolved we don't like it when
[36:27] it's not buttoned up when it's uncertain
[36:29] when when we don't really know we don't
[36:31] like the unknown that's why people tend
[36:33] to not like the
[36:35] dark because it's
[36:37] unknown and they they I mean it there's
[36:40] the the the fear of the dark is
[36:42] not doesn't make any
[36:45] sense let's just say it that way there's
[36:48] no reason to be afraid just because
[36:49] there's no light because nothing's
[36:50] change there's nothing dangerous there's
[36:52] no reason to be afraid but it's the fact
[36:54] that you don't know whether there's
[36:56] something dangerous is there are not
[36:57] that causes the fear it's the unknown
[36:59] it's not really the darkness it's the
[37:01] unknown it's the uncertainty and so us
[37:04] as human beings we're always trying to
[37:08] we're we and some of us are worse than
[37:10] others and I happen to be one of the
[37:11] worst ones but we're trying to button
[37:15] everything up and tighten everything
[37:16] down and have an explanation for
[37:18] everything because that brings security
[37:20] to us right all
[37:23] right but you know there's some things
[37:26] that we just don't
[37:28] know and there's some things that we we
[37:32] we can't always speak for certainty and
[37:35] God does things beyond our human
[37:37] intellect and he and God is not doing
[37:40] things to make us intellectually
[37:41] comfortable or secure but he's actually
[37:43] fulfilling his word the way he always
[37:45] intended to fulfill it and he hasn't
[37:48] have to do it in a way that makes us
[37:50] comfortable but he has to do it
[37:52] according to his promise amen and so and
[37:55] so now you know when when Mary is living
[37:58] out the prophecy she's absolutely the
[38:00] word of God made manifest without any
[38:01] shadow of a doubt and she's standing
[38:03] there the word for her day yes and she
[38:06] can say the angel come this is Isaiah
[38:08] 7:14 and she's exactly right but then
[38:11] the critic can come along and that
[38:13] little critic can say no no no wait a
[38:15] minute now the prophecy says now a son
[38:17] has to be born let's wait and see what
[38:19] that baby
[38:21] is let's see if this is the word or
[38:25] not
[38:27] yeah
[38:29] yes then when the baby's born and it
[38:31] happens to be a
[38:33] male well but it also says it would be
[38:36] God With Us and there's other prophecies
[38:38] and there's other things that were said
[38:39] let's just wait and see you see you see
[38:42] both sides I mean you could be so wrong
[38:45] with that idea of wanting to be so sure
[38:47] and wait and delay and delay and listen
[38:50] there's always something that you could
[38:51] look for even back in with the Pharisees
[38:54] when Jesus come he he was known to have
[38:57] come out of Nazareth he was known to be
[38:59] a Galilean he was known by that and then
[39:01] when he come they begin to say read the
[39:03] scriptures does any Prophet come out of
[39:05] Nazareth does any Prophet come out of
[39:07] [Music]
[39:09] Galilee no but but you know that out of
[39:14] Bethlehem will come the ruler amen but
[39:16] what you didn't know is he was actually
[39:17] born in Bethlehem while he was still
[39:19] young he ran away to Egypt and from
[39:22] Egypt he was afraid to go to back to
[39:23] Bethlehem so they went up to Nazareth
[39:25] you don't know the whole story so you're
[39:27] denying it based on what you think the
[39:30] word says but you don't actually have
[39:32] all the
[39:34] pieces he was spot on with the word and
[39:37] in every way with the word but because
[39:39] it didn't measure up somehow to to one
[39:41] of your measuring
[39:44] sticks and the Pharisees felt justified
[39:47] in rejecting him because no Prophet
[39:49] comes out on Naz nothing good comes out
[39:51] of neth there's no Galilean
[39:54] Prophet well did you know he was born
[39:56] Bor in
[39:58] Bethlehem right oh did you know he fled
[40:01] to Egypt oh did you know there was a
[40:03] prophecy that was hidden in the life of
[40:06] Jacob when it says out of out of out of
[40:09] Egypt will I call my son
[40:11] Jacob
[40:13] oh you're rejecting an entire
[40:17] prophecy because of a detail that you
[40:21] don't even really have all the facts
[40:23] about yes praise be to God you know
[40:28] sometimes you start ministering
[40:29] something I have no clue where I'm going
[40:31] I have no idea what I'm doing because
[40:33] it's just something God's moving in and
[40:35] and I don't really know I don't when it
[40:38] comes to something like this friends I I
[40:40] uh like I said last Sunday I feel like
[40:42] I'm tiptoeing on the razor's Edge and
[40:44] and and dancing through landmines
[40:46] because I mean you could be so wrong in
[40:49] any one of these steps that you take
[40:51] that you could absolutely destroy
[40:52] something but the truth is always right
[40:54] down the middle
[40:57] yeah you can go extreme either way but
[41:01] but there has to be a reality that we
[41:03] face and that reality has to match the
[41:05] reality that they've always faced in
[41:07] every generation in every age so Mary is
[41:10] is is living in a reality she's living
[41:13] right smack dab in the middle of
[41:15] fulfilled prophecy she's living smack
[41:18] dab in the middle of the word she is the
[41:21] word the word is alive she is part of
[41:23] the prophecy and it is true and it is
[41:25] happening right before their very eyes
[41:28] but then they say but but what about
[41:30] this and what about that and what about
[41:32] his name will be Emanuel and what about
[41:34] these other prophecies all she can say I
[41:36] don't know about that I don't know how
[41:38] that will happen but I know this is
[41:40] absolutely right this is Isaiah
[41:45] 7:14 what about the rest I don't know
[41:48] about the rest and you know what she
[41:50] could stand there and go before the
[41:51] council and go undergo interrogation and
[41:53] she could not explain everything to them
[41:56] that they would want to have explained
[41:58] to make it neat and tidy so that they
[42:00] could put their stamp of approval on it
[42:02] all she could say is what she knew to be
[42:04] true and what she knew to be true was
[42:05] absolutely thus sayeth the Lord
[42:09] correct let's look at acts
[42:25] 13
[42:29] acts 13 and
[42:36] 46 then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and
[42:39] said it was necessary that the word of
[42:41] God should first have been spoken to you
[42:42] but seeing that you put it from you and
[42:44] judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting
[42:46] life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so
[42:48] hath the Lord commanded us saying I have
[42:50] set thee to be a light of the Gentiles
[42:53] that thou should us be for salvation
[42:55] unto the ends of the into the ends of
[42:58] the
[42:59] Earth that is a prophecy out of Isaiah
[43:04] 49 that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah 49:6
[43:07] Isaiah 49:6 says and he said it is a is
[43:10] it a light thing that thou should us be
[43:11] my servant to raise up the tribes of
[43:13] Jacob and to restore the preserved of
[43:16] Israel I will also give thee for a light
[43:18] to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my
[43:20] salvation until the end of the Earth
[43:23] that's Isaiah 49:6 now now he says verse
[43:27] 47 in Chapter 13 of Acts for so hath the
[43:32] Lord commanded us saying I have set thee
[43:33] to be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[43:35] should us be for salvation unto the ends
[43:38] of the Earth it's interesting isn't
[43:42] it we believe that was the ministry of
[43:44] the Apostle Paul that God fulfilled that
[43:47] prophecy through him and that through
[43:49] him he was to be for salvation unto the
[43:51] ends of the Earth unto the yeah ends of
[43:54] the Earth
[43:56] and but the question could arise but
[43:59] Paul didn't go everywhere on the Earth
[44:01] right Paul didn't cover every
[44:04] country he didn't cover every language
[44:07] he didn't cover all the territory he he
[44:09] only went to parts of it and so so did
[44:12] Paul fulfill that was that true when
[44:15] Paul says this is what the Lord told me
[44:17] were the Fulfillment of Isaiah 49:6 or
[44:19] was Paul wrong because Paul didn't go to
[44:22] the full ends of the Earth and I say
[44:24] Paul was absolutely every bit right
[44:27] because God through Paul brought the
[44:29] word that word has went into our Bibles
[44:32] and this Bible has covered the entire
[44:34] Earth amen what was it it was the
[44:36] ministry of Paul amen God would send him
[44:38] to prison so he couldn't continue to
[44:40] travel to the ends of the Earth anymore
[44:42] and he would start writing letters
[44:44] because this is how God was going to get
[44:46] Paul's Ministry to the ends of the
[44:52] Earth and the question is when did that
[44:55] prophet prophecy in like when did it
[44:57] start and when did it end I would say
[44:59] it's continuing on I say we're still
[45:02] living in this prophecy amen where the
[45:04] light that God was going to use Paul to
[45:06] be a light to the Gentiles and a light
[45:08] for salvation to the end of the world
[45:10] that light is still shining that light
[45:12] is still moving out we're still in that
[45:14] prophecy
[45:17] sir so it's
[45:19] true it was going on in Paul's day it
[45:23] was happening everywhere he went he was
[45:26] Isaiah 496 being man made manifest every
[45:29] place that he trod every Journey he took
[45:32] in his boat rides and in his travels on
[45:34] land what was it it was the Fulfillment
[45:36] of Isaiah 496 it was happening before
[45:39] their eyes amen but they could reject it
[45:41] because well now he's in prison now he's
[45:43] not traveling anymore well now he's
[45:47] dead I guess he was
[45:49] wrong no he was absolutely right what
[45:52] was wrong was the gray matter between
[45:54] your ears thinking that you knew the the
[45:56] conclusion to the prophecy thinking that
[45:58] you knew how God would do it that's the
[46:00] problem amen the problem wasn't that
[46:02] Paul was wrong Paul was absolutely wrong
[46:05] what was wrong was that old human
[46:08] nature yes sir you can see now as time
[46:11] goes on you can see how the only way
[46:14] that God the only way that this plan of
[46:17] God is going to work is by faith because
[46:19] it's never going to be done
[46:20] intellectually there's always too many
[46:22] questions there's all many things that
[46:24] are fulfilled unexpectedly or in a way
[46:26] that is not easily
[46:29] explained so it's got to be by
[46:32] faith man I want to look at a couple of
[46:35] slides I'm going to bounce back and
[46:36] forth between notes and slides as we
[46:38] move forward but I I I I hope you're
[46:40] catching my thought the prophecy and
[46:43] process almost every Prophecy in the
[46:46] Bible had a process to its
[46:48] fulfillment some of those processes are
[46:50] still continuing on today like the light
[46:53] to the Gentiles for salvation that's
[46:54] still continuing on
[46:56] gone the the the process of of uh Isaiah
[47:00] 7:14 it was a process that process you
[47:03] say how long did it take well it took at
[47:06] least 10 months from the time the angel
[47:09] came until you know a virgin conceived
[47:13] till a son is
[47:15] born and then he's called Emanuel but
[47:18] he's called Emanuel because he's God
[47:20] with us so why was he called Emanuel was
[47:22] just a title at Birth or or was it
[47:24] actually the manifestation of God being
[47:26] with us that made him Emanuel I I'm not
[47:28] trying to answer the question I'm just
[47:29] telling you it may not be like what we
[47:31] think so that prophecy had a period of
[47:34] time it was being fulfilled but while it
[47:36] was being fulfilled it was still true it
[47:39] was still happening it was still the
[47:41] Fulfillment of the prophecy it was still
[47:43] the word made flesh it was still the
[47:44] word for that day it had
[47:47] come
[47:49] yes
[47:51] amen when let's just say it this way
[47:57] if I could just rephrase
[47:59] it let's say you're a
[48:02] Pharisee and you hear the story going
[48:05] around that a virgin has conceived she
[48:07] claims she met an angel and she claimed
[48:09] that this is the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7
[48:11] and it looks like it could be
[48:16] and and you
[48:18] say I won't believe
[48:21] it until I see the son until I know it's
[48:24] Emanuel I refuse to accept it until I
[48:28] know that everything that was mentioned
[48:30] is
[48:32] fulfilled the problem is you would be be
[48:35] be rejecting the word for your
[48:37] day and if you would say that prophecy
[48:41] is not fulfilled because of this part
[48:43] and that part and you reject it as being
[48:47] true because of that then you're
[48:50] rejecting the
[48:52] truth yes you're re now now now don't
[48:55] don't get me wrong it's not saying yes
[48:57] but there's more and I'm watching for
[48:58] the more there's nothing wrong with that
[49:00] but to reject it as true would be wrong
[49:05] because the truth was she was the Virgin
[49:07] and she had conceived and she was
[49:09] carrying the Messiah that was the truth
[49:12] yeah to to reject that because you
[49:15] didn't understand the other pieces would
[49:17] be rejecting the word
[49:19] amen to say to say to say in that day
[49:25] nope this is not Isaiah 7:14 because of
[49:28] EX you would be completely wrong that'd
[49:31] be completely contrary to the word but
[49:34] to say yes that's true but there's more
[49:37] I can't wait to see the rest that would
[49:39] be right yes yeah you see how we're
[49:44] walking where are we walking I don't
[49:45] know where we're walking but where we're
[49:47] walking it's a tight
[49:48] spot it's a tight spot it's always been
[49:51] a tight
[49:52] spot so let's look at this scripture
[49:54] that we all know really well Revelation
[49:56] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[49:58] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[50:00] sound the mystery of God should be
[50:02] finished as he had declared to his
[50:04] servants the prophets we know that this
[50:07] prophecy has been fulfilled in our day
[50:09] and I just want to pull out this quote
[50:11] from 1961 where brother B said what's
[50:13] the matter with me anyhow I'm only
[50:15] telling you the truth someday you'll
[50:17] catch it someday you'll know what I've
[50:19] told you that I've told you the truth my
[50:21] voice may be silent you might be able to
[50:23] silence the body that's speaking but
[50:25] you'll never never silence that voice it
[50:27] comes from God they stoned Steven but
[50:29] they couldn't stop the message it'll
[50:31] move on them tapes will be played after
[50:33] I'm gone for
[50:37] years we believe
[50:39] that so in the days of the voice of the
[50:42] seventh angel I would say the voice
[50:44] continues
[50:45] on but also says when he begins the
[50:47] sound the mystery of God shall be
[50:49] finished that's absolutely true because
[50:50] he preached the opening of the seals
[50:53] amen and and he preached the M the Great
[50:55] of God the great seven seal that's
[50:57] absolutely true amen it was finished it
[51:00] come to the End of the Age it come to
[51:01] the time of the Fulfillment amen but for
[51:04] me I wasn't even born
[51:07] then so for me to come to this prophecy
[51:10] amen there had to be a voice that would
[51:12] continue on Amen and for me there was a
[51:15] time that that voice began to
[51:18] sound and in my life there was a
[51:20] beginning of the sounding of that voice
[51:22] and in my life there was a finishing of
[51:24] the mystery of God for me because that
[51:27] prophecy is still in process for me and
[51:30] I believe the pro the prophecy is still
[51:32] in process for some of you because
[51:34] there's many of you that been baptized
[51:36] in the last year or two that's come to
[51:37] know the truth that the seals have been
[51:39] open and you've heard that voice
[51:41] although amen the man who spoke is laid
[51:44] silent in the grave for many years but
[51:46] you can't stop that voice it'll go
[51:49] on hallah cuz we're still in the
[51:52] Fulfillment of
[51:54] Prophecy right
[51:56] there's a Time marker yes when he begins
[51:58] to sound absolutely he had to preach it
[52:01] all he had to preach the seals he had to
[52:03] lay it all out that's why there's not
[52:05] another messenger there's not a return
[52:07] of the messenger everything's been laid
[52:09] out there amen but it's been laying out
[52:11] there in a form that we've been missing
[52:13] it not necessarily catching it or not
[52:14] everybody catching it amen because it's
[52:17] got the time that is going to
[52:18] continually unfold this prophecy is
[52:21] still in process that's right amen
[52:28] Amen to say it didn't start would be
[52:30] wrong
[52:36] yes praise God to say it's all over
[52:40] might be wrong
[52:47] too it wasn't over for
[52:50] me thank
[52:52] God it wasn't over for you
[52:55] thank God prophecy was still in
[52:59] process Isaiah 496 is still moving on a
[53:03] light to the Gentiles for salvation in
[53:05] the world Revelation 10:7 is still
[53:08] moving
[53:09] on so thankful friends so
[53:15] thankful let's look at this one in the
[53:17] Feast of trumpets brother REM says this
[53:19] is the complete revelation of Jesus
[53:22] Christ The Seven Seals had the mystery
[53:24] hid of what it was all what it all was
[53:27] and it's supposed to open it in the last
[53:29] day at the leoan age at the end of time
[53:32] thanks be to God that finishes the
[53:34] message to the church that finishes it I
[53:37] believe it that finished the message to
[53:40] the church I'm just so glad it wasn't
[53:42] finished in
[53:45] 1964 cuz I was born in
[53:48] 1977 so that finished when when listen
[53:53] when did it happen at the end end of
[53:55] time
[53:57] yeah you know the end time is a
[54:01] process the end of time itself is a
[54:04] process the end of time is not the meat
[54:07] cleaver dropping now there will be at
[54:09] some point the meat cleaver dropping but
[54:11] you realize that won't even be till the
[54:12] end of the Millennium because the
[54:14] Millennium is still in
[54:15] time so the end time or the end of time
[54:19] is a
[54:21] process and that message that was
[54:24] delivered through that man
[54:26] finished the message to the church it
[54:28] was finished yes I believe that oh but
[54:32] I'm so glad that the prophecy wasn't
[54:35] done being fulfilled or coming into
[54:37] fulfillment it can't be done till every
[54:40] one of the elect come to that last
[54:42] message when at the end of
[54:46] time so where are we at the end of time
[54:49] but brother Chad we've been saying that
[54:50] for 60 years absolutely it's been the
[54:53] End of Time amen it's been the end of
[54:55] the den child dispensation it's been the
[54:57] end of the church ages it's been the end
[54:59] it has been the end time and the end of
[55:02] time all that time is the end
[55:06] time let me just say it this way I don't
[55:09] know how to say it when you get to the
[55:12] end of the sentence you put a period
[55:14] right but you know even a period takes
[55:17] up
[55:20] space even a period has distance from
[55:23] one it may not be much but even a period
[55:25] takes up
[55:27] space so maybe even the period on the
[55:30] end of the Gentile dispensation maybe
[55:32] the period takes up a little bit of
[55:34] space but when you look back over 10,000
[55:37] years of human history maybe it's just a
[55:39] little tiny space even if it's 60 70 80
[55:42] 90
[55:44] years it's the period period now don't
[55:48] forget period even has a start and an
[55:50] end to the
[55:52] period
[55:54] yes
[55:57] amen we want it that's it period flat no
[56:00] more discussion and don't confuse me
[56:03] with any more questions
[56:05] yeah that's human
[56:07] nature amen but praise be to God when
[56:12] when was the seals
[56:13] open at the end of time and that
[56:16] finished the message to the church oh
[56:20] but I'm so glad I got to hear that
[56:23] message and I heard it many years after
[56:26] he made this statement I'm so glad that
[56:29] prophecy is still in process and I can
[56:32] be included in
[56:35] it in the breach he says now you see I'm
[56:39] just not making that up it's thus sayith
[56:42] the Lord I'll read it to you out of the
[56:43] book The sounding of the seventh Angel's
[56:45] message the mystery of God should be
[56:47] finished that's been declared by his
[56:48] holy prophets that's the prophets who
[56:50] has wrote the word at the sounding of
[56:52] the seventh Church age the last Church
[56:54] age all the Loose Ends that through
[56:56] these Church ages have been probed at
[56:58] will be wound up together and when the
[57:00] seals are broke and the Mystery is
[57:02] revealed down comes the angel the
[57:05] messenger Christ setting his foot upon
[57:07] land and upon the sea with a rainbow
[57:09] over his head now remember this seventh
[57:12] angel is on Earth at the time of this
[57:15] coming I'm so glad he put that in there
[57:17] as an emphatic statement amen because
[57:20] there's other things that he says about
[57:22] end time events and there's other things
[57:24] that are written in the scripture and
[57:26] there's other statements brother
[57:27] brandham make that if he wasn't so
[57:29] emphatic in making this statement you
[57:31] could be justified in looking at that
[57:32] and still waiting for something to come
[57:34] that's already come but brother Brandon
[57:36] was so clear that says when when now
[57:39] listen and when the seals are broke yes
[57:42] have the seals been
[57:44] broke the seals were broke in 1965 but
[57:48] you know to me they were still all
[57:49] sealed
[57:51] up but it's been you know several years
[57:54] ago now that those seals I'll say it
[57:57] this way those seals began to break open
[58:00] for me I don't want to be so pomp isite
[58:03] arrogant and say the seals are broke for
[58:04] me because I'm learning something every
[58:06] single day every time I read the message
[58:08] I'm like whoa I didn't know that I never
[58:09] caught that before so I would say the
[58:11] seals began to break open for me some
[58:15] time ago and they're still breaking
[58:18] open I'm in the process of the opening
[58:21] of the seals
[58:23] yes amen
[58:25] so now when the seals were broke and
[58:27] they were broke in
[58:30] 1963 the seals are broke and the Mystery
[58:33] is revealed it was
[58:34] revealed down comes the angel the
[58:37] messenger who's that
[58:41] Christ setting his foot upon land and
[58:43] upon sea with a rainbow over his
[58:46] head now that remember this seventh
[58:49] angels on Earth at the time of this
[58:50] coming and the seventh angel is clearly
[58:53] William brandham
[58:55] the seven Church age messenger the seven
[58:57] messenger and while he was on Earth this
[59:00] event took
[59:09] place I'm going to make a statement and
[59:12] I may be I just just bear with me for
[59:15] just a few
[59:16] minutes I say that event took
[59:19] place I should say that event began
[59:22] taking
[59:23] place
[59:25] and is still taking
[59:31] place we so want to file stuff in one
[59:33] cubby hole or
[59:35] another but the word of God has a way of
[59:37] busting out of all our cubby holes and
[59:39] filling
[59:41] everything running here and running
[59:43] there and running all over the place we
[59:45] try to confine it and contain it into a
[59:47] nice package so that it becomes
[59:49] understandable for us and then when we
[59:51] see other things that don't seem to make
[59:52] sense when then somehow we just don't
[59:54] want to look at
[59:56] that but God has a way of breaking out
[59:59] of our boundaries amen and that word
[1:00:01] can't be confined by our
[1:00:05] intellect so we know that this messenger
[1:00:08] Christ had to come at the time the
[1:00:11] seventh angel was on Earth had to we
[1:00:15] have a Tim stamp of when that
[1:00:18] began but what we don't have is the Tim
[1:00:20] stamp of when that
[1:00:23] goes right when it ends that's right
[1:00:26] when it stops being pertinent and
[1:00:28] relevant in this
[1:00:33] dispensation I want to read something
[1:00:36] here out of the
[1:00:39] token he says neither could these things
[1:00:42] come at other times this could not have
[1:00:44] come in the days of Luther it could not
[1:00:45] have come in the days of Wesley the days
[1:00:47] of the Baptist or the methodists in
[1:00:49] their days it it couldn't have come it
[1:00:51] has to come now Israel has to be a
[1:00:53] nation the church churches has to be
[1:00:55] like they are now there had to be a
[1:00:57] third message the Third Church age there
[1:00:59] had to be a leoa it could not it could
[1:01:02] not form until Pentecost come and shot
[1:01:04] their Wad and went out and organized and
[1:01:06] did what they did then it has to come
[1:01:09] then comes the Lord when they put him
[1:01:11] out of the church he is the
[1:01:14] word so when Pentecost
[1:01:17] comes which is the last
[1:01:20] Revival the previous Revival when the
[1:01:23] Pentecostal Revival comes which is in
[1:01:24] the leodan church age when they come and
[1:01:27] they organize and they reject the word
[1:01:30] then he
[1:01:32] comes then comes the
[1:01:35] Lord he is the
[1:01:37] word so how does he
[1:01:40] come say brother Chad I didn't see any
[1:01:43] pictures of a giant Jesus while brother
[1:01:46] B was on Earth with one foot on land and
[1:01:47] one foot on
[1:01:50] sea so does it mean it wasn't fulfilled
[1:01:52] because you don't have a picture
[1:01:56] no it was spiritually
[1:01:57] fulfilled it was a spiritual happening
[1:02:00] that took place he is the word and he
[1:02:02] came in
[1:02:08] fullness there's a prophecy that brother
[1:02:11] bham goes to over and over and over
[1:02:13] again in Luke 17:30 and he begins to
[1:02:17] show that even thus shall it be in the
[1:02:21] day when the son of man is revealed he
[1:02:23] starts pointing to a Time when the son
[1:02:24] of man will be revealed and we know
[1:02:26] Jesus Christ is the son of man and his
[1:02:28] prophetic Ministry and he says as it was
[1:02:30] in the days of lot and Sodom and he
[1:02:32] starts to give us the time frame as it
[1:02:34] was in the days of Noah as it was in the
[1:02:36] days of lot and brother B picks this up
[1:02:38] and uses it as an analogy to depict the
[1:02:41] day in which you're living and showing
[1:02:42] that the son of man would be revealed
[1:02:44] but in Matthew 24 when it describes the
[1:02:46] same thing it shows it as the coming of
[1:02:47] the son of man so brother bam ties the
[1:02:49] two together the coming of the son of
[1:02:51] man and the revealing of the son of man
[1:02:52] are
[1:02:53] linked
[1:02:55] and he and he makes this statement in
[1:02:57] the message proving his word says as it
[1:02:59] was in the days of Sodom now watch close
[1:03:01] in the days of Sodom so will it be at
[1:03:03] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:03:05] son of man is being revealed that's
[1:03:07] where he connects the two together which
[1:03:09] is Matthew 24 and Luke 17 he says as it
[1:03:13] was in the days of Sodom so will it be
[1:03:16] at the coming of the son of man when the
[1:03:18] son of man is being revealed so have we
[1:03:20] seen the revealing of the son of
[1:03:23] man that's also the coming of the son of
[1:03:26] man which can be said the coming of the
[1:03:29] Lord and that statement frightens many
[1:03:31] people because the coming of the Lord
[1:03:33] has many aspects and many prophecies
[1:03:36] attached to that many things there's the
[1:03:39] the the coming of the Lord also includes
[1:03:42] the battle of Armageddon an absolute
[1:03:44] destruction it also includes himself
[1:03:46] revealing himself to the 144,000 there's
[1:03:48] many things included at the coming of
[1:03:50] the Lord and if I look at all those
[1:03:52] details like I look at Isaiah 7 74 a
[1:03:55] virgin shall conceive I can say well he
[1:03:57] hasn't revealed himself to 144,000 they
[1:03:59] haven't seen and mourned as one that
[1:04:01] gives uh uh Mourns for a only son that
[1:04:04] prophecy is not fulfilled and this
[1:04:05] part's not fulfilled and this part is
[1:04:06] not fulfilled so there it's not true
[1:04:08] it's still true just as true it was in
[1:04:12] the Virgin Mary that she was the
[1:04:13] Fulfillment of the word and that
[1:04:14] prophecy was in fulfillment the same
[1:04:16] thing's true now concerning the coming
[1:04:18] of the Lord amen so is there more to be
[1:04:22] fulfilled is there more Prophet
[1:04:23] absolutely
[1:04:25] absolutely so now he says so shall it be
[1:04:28] at the coming of the son of man when the
[1:04:30] son of man is being revealed not no more
[1:04:32] as a church seed not no more the bride
[1:04:34] is called in the day the son of man will
[1:04:37] be revealed what to join the church to
[1:04:40] the head to unite the marriage of the
[1:04:42] Bride the bridegroom call will come
[1:04:44] right through this when the son of man
[1:04:46] will come down in human flesh to unite
[1:04:48] the two together the church has to be
[1:04:51] the word he is the word and the two
[1:04:53] unites together and to do that it'll
[1:04:55] take the manifestation of the revealing
[1:04:57] of the son of man not a clergyman oh I
[1:05:00] don't know do you see what I mean see
[1:05:02] it's a son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:05:04] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[1:05:07] make his word so real that it'll unite
[1:05:09] the church in him as one the bride and
[1:05:12] then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:05:13] supper amen she's already United see we
[1:05:16] go to the wedding supper not the
[1:05:18] marriage so now brother says now the son
[1:05:22] of man is going to come right down in
[1:05:23] the human flesh what human flesh was he
[1:05:25] talking about he was talking about his
[1:05:28] and make the so word so real amen how
[1:05:30] did Christ make the so words so real and
[1:05:32] proved that he was the same yesterday
[1:05:34] today forever he did the same works
[1:05:36] right in that prophet in a prophetic
[1:05:38] Ministry and what did he do he made the
[1:05:40] word so real that it actually United The
[1:05:42] Head and the body together Christ and
[1:05:44] his bride together to do what it was the
[1:05:47] uniting time in signs it was the
[1:05:49] invisible Union of the Bride it was the
[1:05:51] marriage that was coming am then you go
[1:05:54] to the scripture and says the marriage
[1:05:56] of the Bride has come praise God Amen it
[1:05:59] had to happen when Eleazar was here amen
[1:06:01] the marriage set in
[1:06:06] amen but I'm so glad that the marriage
[1:06:09] ceremony didn't end
[1:06:15] then because I was born in
[1:06:23] 1977
[1:06:27] where was the
[1:06:29] marriage well he tells
[1:06:31] us eleazar's Ministry was to fetch a
[1:06:35] bride for Isaac and brother benam was
[1:06:36] fulfilling the role of Eleazar fetching
[1:06:38] a bride for Isaac and then down through
[1:06:40] that flesh down through that body amen
[1:06:42] the son of man was being revealed and
[1:06:44] making the word so real that she would
[1:06:46] recognize it and come to her bridegroom
[1:06:48] and there would be a a union that would
[1:06:50] take place a marriage that would begin
[1:06:52] to set in oh God it happened but if I
[1:06:55] say it happened then I can't be
[1:07:01] married it happened in 1963 it was
[1:07:04] happening through the end of the
[1:07:05] ministry you can yeah absolutely I
[1:07:07] believe all of that amen the marriage
[1:07:10] has begun the Union's taking place but
[1:07:12] I'm so glad it didn't end because if it
[1:07:14] ended there then I wouldn't be married
[1:07:16] to Christ I couldn't come to an
[1:07:18] invisible Union I couldn't be part of
[1:07:20] the body United to the head so there
[1:07:22] must be a a prophecy in process as the
[1:07:27] bride is being united with Christ The
[1:07:30] Marriage of the Lamb has come it's still
[1:07:33] going
[1:07:35] on I don't know when you United with
[1:07:38] Christ but I know when I United with
[1:07:40] Christ amen and and and I come into that
[1:07:42] visible Union and I pray and believe
[1:07:45] amen that that marriage is still going
[1:07:47] on we're still in the marriage of the
[1:07:49] Lamb we're still in the ceremony it's
[1:07:51] still taking place so there's somebody
[1:07:52] else that can get married Mar
[1:07:56] too because once you go to the wedding
[1:07:58] supper the marriage is
[1:08:01] over so we haven't yet went to the
[1:08:03] marriage supper so we're still in the
[1:08:05] marriage we know when the marriage
[1:08:11] started amen are we on the same
[1:08:14] page but the marriage won't finish till
[1:08:16] we go to the marriage supper so we're
[1:08:18] still in the
[1:08:20] marriage and there's a prophecy in
[1:08:23] process
[1:08:25] yes praise God I'm not waiting for it to
[1:08:29] come but neither am I cutting every
[1:08:31] human being on the plan out of it by
[1:08:32] saying it's already
[1:08:34] come it has already
[1:08:37] come but it hasn't yet
[1:08:41] went so if it's come and not
[1:08:44] went then where are
[1:08:48] we we're uniting with our
[1:08:51] bridegroom we are in the uniting process
[1:08:54] right now amen we're uniting with him
[1:08:57] we're becoming one with
[1:08:59] him it's
[1:09:02] happening also you know we don't want to
[1:09:05] use
[1:09:07] trivial human mindset yes that says you
[1:09:12] know I I went to the altar I gave my
[1:09:13] heart to the Lord I was filled with the
[1:09:14] Holy Ghost I United with Christ under
[1:09:16] the banner of this message and I was
[1:09:18] married in
[1:09:21] 1979 listen the invisible is still
[1:09:24] taking place you're still uniting to
[1:09:29] him you're still pledging yourself to
[1:09:32] him and you're still this is still the
[1:09:35] uniting time and signs we're still in
[1:09:38] the invisible Union you and all of you
[1:09:41] are probably like me yes I I came to the
[1:09:44] realization yes God unlocked the mystery
[1:09:46] in my heart yes I United with him but
[1:09:49] but when I look back at that uniting
[1:09:51] versus what's going on now I realize I I
[1:09:54] have been uniting with him I have been
[1:09:57] joining to him I have been coming to my
[1:10:00] bridegroom I have been coming under his
[1:10:02] head shift and it's still going
[1:10:05] on there's a prophecy in process thank
[1:10:11] god let's go back to the slide here the
[1:10:15] first video says at the end of the
[1:10:17] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[1:10:19] receive according to the word as God
[1:10:21] helped me tonight to show you through
[1:10:22] here that we receive a messenger that
[1:10:25] will take all these Loose Ends there and
[1:10:27] reveal the whole Secret Of God for the
[1:10:30] rapturing of the
[1:10:31] church so the he's supposed to reveal
[1:10:34] the whole Secret Of God what was the
[1:10:36] purpose for the rapturing of the
[1:10:39] church that was
[1:10:42] 1963 that was more than 60 years
[1:10:47] ago question is did he tie together the
[1:10:49] Loose Ends sure did he reveal the whole
[1:10:52] secret of God what' he do for the
[1:10:54] rapturing of the
[1:10:56] church did I miss
[1:11:00] something let's keep going the word that
[1:11:04] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[1:11:05] work this day no sir that was for
[1:11:07] Pentecost this is for the bride going
[1:11:10] home of the Bride we got something
[1:11:12] different the Pentecostals represented
[1:11:13] that again we're in the bride
[1:11:16] age praise God what what is this message
[1:11:21] for it's for the bride it's for the
[1:11:22] going home the bride it's for the
[1:11:25] Rapture of the Bride it's for the going
[1:11:26] to the marriage supper yes but you can't
[1:11:29] go to the marriage supper until you
[1:11:30] first complete the marriage and when you
[1:11:33] complete the marriage then you can go to
[1:11:34] the marriage supper and there's no way
[1:11:36] we're going to complete this marriage
[1:11:37] until the last predestinated seed comes
[1:11:39] in is Unified with
[1:11:41] Christ so we're still in the marriage
[1:11:43] but this message is for the going home
[1:11:45] of the Bride
[1:11:48] H we'll just say you all know it anyways
[1:11:51] you all are miles ahead of me
[1:11:54] but what if the going home of the Bride
[1:11:55] is a process
[1:11:57] too what if the journey home what if the
[1:12:00] Rapture is also a prophecy in
[1:12:05] process what if the bride is going home
[1:12:08] right
[1:12:11] now what if the bride is in the Rapture
[1:12:14] now and being raptured present
[1:12:17] tense brother M said how do you know the
[1:12:19] Rapture is not going on all the time
[1:12:22] right yes what a statement you ask
[1:12:25] yourself why would he say something like
[1:12:27] that like just make it so plain and so
[1:12:30] easy and then all of a sudden when when
[1:12:32] when when the light bul goes off it is
[1:12:33] so plain and easy how do you know that
[1:12:35] the Rapture is not going on all the time
[1:12:37] why are you looking for something to
[1:12:38] happen why are you looking for this pin
[1:12:40] prick and I say I want the period
[1:12:42] remember the period takes up
[1:12:48] space he
[1:12:52] says
[1:12:55] all right no I don't want to read this
[1:12:56] quit reading stop too far ahead you
[1:13:00] already read something of it I know you
[1:13:02] did ruined
[1:13:05] it I want to I want to look at something
[1:13:07] else for just a minute if we could turn
[1:13:09] to Genesis
[1:13:15] 15 I'm intentionally Friends making
[1:13:18] myself slow down because if I take any
[1:13:21] one of these and just take off preaching
[1:13:22] it'll be so much fun will enjoy it so
[1:13:24] much but I whenever you're preaching
[1:13:26] whenever you get preaching you get in
[1:13:29] under the inspiration people are pulling
[1:13:30] you keep going down a track and keep
[1:13:32] going down a track and keep going down a
[1:13:33] track but I don't want to I want to hit
[1:13:35] this track then I want to jump over and
[1:13:37] get back on this
[1:13:38] track because we're trying to talk about
[1:13:42] these two things being true at the same
[1:13:44] time the prophecy and
[1:13:47] process in Genesis CH 15:
[1:13:52] 13 and he said unto Abram know of
[1:13:55] assurity that thy seed shall be a
[1:13:56] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[1:13:58] and Shall Serve them and they shall
[1:14:00] afflict them 400 years and also that
[1:14:02] Nation whom they Shall Serve will I
[1:14:04] judge and afterward shall they come out
[1:14:05] with a great substance and thou shalt go
[1:14:08] to the fathers in peace Thou shalt be
[1:14:09] buried in a good old
[1:14:11] age and in the fourth generation they
[1:14:13] shall come hither again for the iniquity
[1:14:16] of the amorites is not yet
[1:14:18] full so here we have a
[1:14:22] prophecy this prophecy is that the
[1:14:25] children is going to se his children
[1:14:26] will seed will soj in a Strange Land for
[1:14:29] 400 years but that God is going to bring
[1:14:31] them out God is going to deliver them
[1:14:33] and God is going to judge that Nation
[1:14:35] but also in the prophecy God's going to
[1:14:37] bring them back to that
[1:14:38] land so that's all encapsulated in the
[1:14:42] prophecy the question is how long did it
[1:14:44] take for that prophecy to be
[1:14:46] fulfilled you can say 40 years yeah 40
[1:14:49] years but maybe more than 40 years
[1:14:51] because you know Moses comes at the
[1:14:53] appointed time at the end of 400 years
[1:14:55] and Moses is ready to enter in but he's
[1:14:57] not yet ready the people are not yet
[1:14:58] ready so Moses goes 40 years on the back
[1:15:01] side of the Wilderness to get some child
[1:15:03] training question is is that part of the
[1:15:05] prophecy too yeah I think so and then he
[1:15:08] comes back and now God brings a mighty
[1:15:10] deliverance and they come out with a
[1:15:12] great spoil they come out they spoil
[1:15:14] them they come out and they they they've
[1:15:15] prospered amen they go in the journey
[1:15:17] God judges them mightily through the
[1:15:19] plagues they cross through the Red Sea
[1:15:21] the Army's destroyed they're singing on
[1:15:23] the other Bank of the Red Sea uh
[1:15:25] mariam's going up and down with a
[1:15:26] tambourine and the women are singing and
[1:15:28] dancing because their enemy has been
[1:15:30] destroyed they have been completely
[1:15:32] delivered and the prophecy has been
[1:15:35] fulfilled
[1:15:40] mostly there's nothing wrong for singing
[1:15:42] dancing and nothing wrong for saying the
[1:15:44] word has been
[1:15:45] fulfilled this day this scripture is
[1:15:48] fulfilled before their
[1:15:51] eyes but part of the
[1:15:54] prophecy was that they're going to go in
[1:15:56] and return to the land that was promised
[1:15:57] to
[1:15:59] Abraham so God faithful in his word he
[1:16:02] takes them to the to the land of promise
[1:16:04] but we know at cadis Baria that they
[1:16:06] make a a mistake and they're afraid to
[1:16:08] go on and they're rejected and then they
[1:16:10] wander for 40 years and all of those
[1:16:12] that were in that generation die off and
[1:16:14] God raises up a new generation and that
[1:16:16] new generation goes in and when they go
[1:16:19] in listen when they go into the land
[1:16:22] amen now now you can say you know now we
[1:16:25] see the Fulfillment of the prophecy the
[1:16:27] whole thing has been the Fulfillment of
[1:16:29] the prophecy the entire duration the the
[1:16:32] the the the bring the the birth of Moses
[1:16:36] was part of this
[1:16:38] prophecy you know everything was working
[1:16:41] it's all the prophecy and it's all the
[1:16:43] Fulfillment of the prophecy amen and
[1:16:46] even when they get into the promised
[1:16:47] land amen part of the prophecy is that
[1:16:49] they'll inherit the land that was given
[1:16:51] to Abraham but we know as they move
[1:16:53] moved in to start to possess it they
[1:16:54] never fully possessed it so the question
[1:16:56] is is that prophecy been fully fulfilled
[1:16:58] or not fully
[1:17:00] fulfilled I'm not answering the question
[1:17:02] it's a just good question but God kept
[1:17:04] his word and God fulfilled the prophecy
[1:17:06] but all along they were in the process
[1:17:08] of the prophecy and it was correct to
[1:17:10] sing and dance and shout and sing and re
[1:17:12] re glory in God but then to say it's all
[1:17:15] over now we're a nation now let's set up
[1:17:17] camp let's let's let's build our city
[1:17:20] right here in si no you can't stop now
[1:17:23] the prophecy's in process it's got to go
[1:17:25] to the next stage to where you enter
[1:17:27] into the land and take the full
[1:17:31] promise
[1:17:32] amen now I want to read a just a couple
[1:17:36] quotes oh my there's so many things I
[1:17:39] want to get into all right in the
[1:17:42] message it is the rising of the sun says
[1:17:44] hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:17:45] talking about it was waved over the
[1:17:47] people and the first time there will
[1:17:49] come forth for the bride age for a
[1:17:50] resurrection out of dark
[1:17:52] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:17:54] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:17:56] back again in its full power and being
[1:17:58] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:18:00] and wonders that he did back there
[1:18:02] because I live you live also speaking to
[1:18:05] his wife because I live you live also
[1:18:07] what a resurrection that was and what a
[1:18:09] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:18:12] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[1:18:14] Jesus by God's quickening power so when
[1:18:17] we read quotes like this you can say
[1:18:19] this is the resurrection it absolutely
[1:18:21] is this is the resurrection out of
[1:18:24] denominationalism this is the catching
[1:18:26] up out of leoa and coming into the bride
[1:18:29] a this is a resurrection amen but this
[1:18:31] isn't the end of the Resurrection this
[1:18:34] Resurrection will produce the next
[1:18:36] Resurrection which is the resurrection
[1:18:38] of the sleeping Saints here's something
[1:18:41] else brother BM says in God's provided
[1:18:42] place of worship says now notice when
[1:18:45] this great moving power of God comes
[1:18:46] onto a Son of God it quickens him the
[1:18:49] spirit of Life enters into him then what
[1:18:52] does it do it seats them in Heavenly
[1:18:54] places right now not they will be we are
[1:18:58] now we've already
[1:19:02] resurrected right so it's a true
[1:19:05] statement that says the True Church of
[1:19:07] God has already
[1:19:11] resurrected am I telling the
[1:19:14] truth and it's also a true statement to
[1:19:16] say someday I expect all the Church of
[1:19:19] God to
[1:19:21] resurrect right is that also a true
[1:19:25] statement so if you make one statement
[1:19:27] and I make the other should we start an
[1:19:29] argument and a debate and separate
[1:19:36] Fellowship cuz we are in the middle of a
[1:19:39] prophecy being
[1:19:40] unfolded we are smack dab in the middle
[1:19:43] of it and it's always transition times
[1:19:45] that it get a little murky and a little
[1:19:46] unsure for many people but listen
[1:19:48] friends we're right smack dabbing this
[1:19:50] prophecy this is the resurrection SE
[1:19:52] season and the resurrection has begun
[1:19:54] we're in Rapture season and the Rapture
[1:19:56] is commencing
[1:20:00] now we are in the Fulfillment of the
[1:20:03] prophecy we're smack dab in the middle
[1:20:05] of it we should Rejoice we should sing
[1:20:07] We should declare just as just as just
[1:20:10] as much as the Virgin Mary declared that
[1:20:12] this is the word made flesh and I'm the
[1:20:14] Virgin and this is Isaiah 7 we should
[1:20:16] declare that this is the resurrection
[1:20:18] out of dead denominationalism the church
[1:20:20] has raised up again the word is alive
[1:20:22] and restored once again this is the
[1:20:24] marriage of the Lamb it has come this is
[1:20:26] the rapture it's in process this is the
[1:20:28] going home of the Bride amen this is
[1:20:31] this is the coming of the Lord this is
[1:20:33] all of
[1:20:36] it but you know what I don't want to do
[1:20:39] I don't want to set up a camp at the
[1:20:41] base of sin and say we've
[1:20:45] arrived cuz there's more in this
[1:20:47] prophecy as we're moving through it
[1:20:50] there's more being fulfilled all the
[1:20:52] time
[1:20:54] this is why oh I praise be to God this
[1:21:00] is why God is
[1:21:01] good I want to look at a couple things
[1:21:03] because I keep wanting to get ahead of
[1:21:04] myself when we look at the scripture
[1:21:06] brother brandom us when he preached the
[1:21:07] Rapture he comes to 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[1:21:10] said for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:21:12] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:21:14] of the Archangel with the Trump of God
[1:21:16] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:21:18] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:21:19] be caught up together with them in the
[1:21:21] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:21:23] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:21:25] Brother bam uses this uh when he
[1:21:28] preaches the the the um Rapture message
[1:21:32] and he begins to break down the Rapture
[1:21:33] into three parts yes the shout the voice
[1:21:37] and the
[1:21:39] Trump and he says three things happen a
[1:21:42] voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to
[1:21:45] happen before Jesus appears now a shout
[1:21:48] Jesus does all three of them when he's
[1:21:51] when he's descending
[1:21:55] yes so maybe descending is a
[1:22:03] process but I thought his land was on
[1:22:05] his foot already on land
[1:22:08] yeah it's
[1:22:10] true it's still going
[1:22:13] on a shout what is the shout it is the
[1:22:16] message going forth first the living
[1:22:19] bread of life bringing forth the
[1:22:21] bride has the shout went forth
[1:22:24] absolutely have you heard the shout yes
[1:22:26] has it gathered you out of the
[1:22:28] denominations and churches in the world
[1:22:30] and is it gathered you to Christ
[1:22:31] absolutely you have heard the shout and
[1:22:33] the shout is part of his descending he
[1:22:35] does all three why he's descending amen
[1:22:38] and it's part of the Rapture so that
[1:22:40] means you've already entered into the
[1:22:42] Rapture by what by the shout Gathering
[1:22:46] you together Gathering you out of
[1:22:48] systems Gathering out of the world
[1:22:49] Gathering you out of yourself and
[1:22:51] bringing you to the United of C you and
[1:22:53] Christ together bringing you to what
[1:22:55] bringing you to the
[1:23:01] marriage praise God said therefore the
[1:23:05] message calls the bride together see the
[1:23:07] shout then he comes says in the Easter
[1:23:11] seal said if you are ordained on that
[1:23:13] ground if we are ordained to be on that
[1:23:15] ground like the eagle walking in the
[1:23:17] chicken's nest if you're ordained on
[1:23:19] that ground the holy spirit is here to
[1:23:21] find you and when it finds you you
[1:23:22] recognize its call you know the hour
[1:23:24] you're living you know these things are
[1:23:26] supposed to happen quickly you're
[1:23:28] raptured up to meet it and now you're
[1:23:30] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:23:33] Jesus you know what this Holy Ghost
[1:23:35] found
[1:23:37] me it revealed that this message is true
[1:23:40] to me it revealed to me that I could
[1:23:42] stand with assurance and say this is the
[1:23:44] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 Luke 1730
[1:23:47] Revelation 10:7 Why by a spirit of
[1:23:49] revelation God dropped into me to open
[1:23:51] it up and I believe that I've heard that
[1:23:53] voice amen I've heard the eagle scream
[1:23:55] and that means quickly I was raptured up
[1:23:58] to meet it that means I was
[1:24:05] raptured then brother Chad if you're
[1:24:09] raptured travel like a
[1:24:13] thought why do you get
[1:24:16] tired why do you get
[1:24:19] sick are you immortal now
[1:24:23] well the truth is I am
[1:24:26] Immortal and I am mortal
[1:24:31] yes I am a prophecy in
[1:24:36] process I am part of the word being
[1:24:40] fulfilled in this
[1:24:42] day am I there all the way yet no but
[1:24:46] there's some place in God that I'm
[1:24:49] already all the way there amen amen and
[1:24:52] there's many places that I'm not yet all
[1:24:54] the way
[1:24:57] there I'm there and I'm not there at the
[1:25:00] same
[1:25:01] time I'll tell you something else I'm
[1:25:04] perfect
[1:25:06] yeah and being made
[1:25:09] perfect at the same
[1:25:11] time you know what that makes me a
[1:25:14] paradox an
[1:25:16] anomaly an
[1:25:18] odity I am perfect in Christ Jesus amen
[1:25:23] I am being made
[1:25:25] perfect by the things I
[1:25:28] suffer I'm being brought into Perfection
[1:25:31] through the ministry through the word
[1:25:33] through the things that I go through
[1:25:34] through trials and tribulation through
[1:25:35] patience working its perfect plan
[1:25:37] bringing me perfect and tire wanting
[1:25:40] nothing so I'm perfect and I'm being
[1:25:44] made perfect
[1:25:46] yes
[1:25:51] simultaneously see in
[1:25:54] reality if we jump on either side of
[1:25:57] these equations and stay there planted
[1:25:59] and make a camp yeah we're going to find
[1:26:01] ourselves in
[1:26:04] error yes because if I come over here to
[1:26:06] this perfect side I've been made perfect
[1:26:08] in Christ Jesus and there's no flaw in
[1:26:10] me and nothing wrong with me and then I
[1:26:12] begin to have confidence in My Flesh and
[1:26:14] I think every thought that I have is of
[1:26:15] the Holy Ghost and I can then begin I
[1:26:18] become my own God and I begin to do
[1:26:19] anything that comes to my mind to do and
[1:26:21] I feel just ified and doing oh my
[1:26:23] goodness how dangerous is
[1:26:26] that but if I move all the way over here
[1:26:29] where I'm just a lowly worm and I'm
[1:26:31] nothing and there's nothing good about
[1:26:32] me and nothing good and I don't know why
[1:26:34] God would ever love me and I can't do
[1:26:36] anything right and I'm nothing I'm
[1:26:37] nothing I'm nothing I'm nothing then the
[1:26:39] problem is that you will never do what
[1:26:41] God has called you to do because God is
[1:26:43] the one working in you both to do and
[1:26:44] the will of his good pleasure you have
[1:26:46] to recognize that there's something else
[1:26:48] inside that's why the Apostle Paul said
[1:26:50] he said in me he said that is in my
[1:26:53] flesh is no good thing because in him
[1:26:56] was something wonderful in him was
[1:26:57] eternal life in him was an attribute of
[1:26:59] God in him was word being made manifest
[1:27:02] in him was a prophecy out of Isaiah in
[1:27:04] him was some absolutely wonderful
[1:27:06] Eternal part of
[1:27:08] God but he said in me that is in my
[1:27:10] flesh I love the
[1:27:13] disclaimer if I camp out over here I
[1:27:15] never have the courage I never have the
[1:27:17] strength I never the faith to ever do
[1:27:19] what God's called me to do because he's
[1:27:20] called me to lay hands on this sick and
[1:27:22] they shall recover he's called me to
[1:27:24] preach the gospel he's called me Amen to
[1:27:26] stand and Shine the Light Of His glory
[1:27:28] but if I'm a worm crawling in the dust
[1:27:30] all the time in my mind I'll never rise
[1:27:33] up and do what he called me to do
[1:27:34] because it takes a certain amount of
[1:27:36] confidence that you are a son of God to
[1:27:39] take Faith in his word and take his word
[1:27:41] by faith and move forward with it
[1:27:42] because why CU I'm a Son of God and the
[1:27:44] word of God can't fail in
[1:27:47] me I can fail the word can't
[1:27:51] fail
[1:27:52] so we've got to be working with both
[1:27:58] truths
[1:28:01] amen so I'm
[1:28:04] raptured and seated in Heavenly places
[1:28:06] in Christ
[1:28:08] Jesus but you know what I'm looking
[1:28:10] forward
[1:28:11] to to the translation of the body and
[1:28:13] being
[1:28:19] raptured because I'm looking forward to
[1:28:21] the raptured doesn't mean I'm denying my
[1:28:25] Rapture but just because I believe I've
[1:28:28] been caught up in Heavenly places in
[1:28:29] Christ Jesus doesn't mean that I'm
[1:28:32] denying my
[1:28:37] Rapture this is why brother benam said
[1:28:39] the truth is right down the
[1:28:43] middle let's look at this next
[1:28:46] one if you are represented up here on
[1:28:48] this attribute of God this God if you
[1:28:50] have it if you're repres represented
[1:28:52] here you cannot you're in the Eternal
[1:28:54] and you've crossed from the seventh day
[1:28:56] into the eighth you got into the Eternal
[1:28:59] by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're
[1:29:01] included in
[1:29:02] this I'm not even in the seventh day
[1:29:07] anymore I'm not even in time
[1:29:10] anymore I've moved to the eight day I've
[1:29:12] moved to the Eternal I've been caught up
[1:29:14] I've been included in this I've been
[1:29:16] born again by the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:18] Ghost I'm in the Eternal I'm in the
[1:29:20] eighth day I am not even in leod deia
[1:29:23] anymore take that Leo
[1:29:30] deia keep saying that as you drive to
[1:29:32] work Monday
[1:29:36] morning to go get a
[1:29:39] paycheck so you can buy some
[1:29:47] groceries and I I don't say you
[1:29:49] shouldn't stop saying you should say
[1:29:50] that because that's the only thing
[1:29:51] that's going to get get you
[1:29:53] through is this
[1:29:56] realization but we also have to realize
[1:29:59] there's something more to come
[1:30:00] to what I feel in my soul is going to be
[1:30:03] all over me this reality that struck my
[1:30:07] soul this life that's deep inside of me
[1:30:09] it will one day become all of my
[1:30:11] thinking because I'll have my theophany
[1:30:13] body it will become every desire in my
[1:30:15] flesh because I will have a glorified
[1:30:17] flesh I one day what what is going on in
[1:30:20] my soul and what has happened on the
[1:30:22] inside of me is going to happen to All
[1:30:23] of
[1:30:26] Me and that will be the
[1:30:30] culmination let's look here how can I
[1:30:33] overcome we see this age that we're
[1:30:35] living in it's one of the grandest ages
[1:30:37] of all ages this leoan church age is the
[1:30:40] grandest of all the church ages because
[1:30:42] it's the ending of time and the blending
[1:30:45] of
[1:30:46] Eternity I want you to catch this phrase
[1:30:48] and really focus in on it what is the
[1:30:51] leoan church Church
[1:30:52] age it is the ending of time and the
[1:30:57] blending of Eternity you know what that
[1:30:59] means to me it's mixed up somewhere in
[1:31:03] between it's not the end of time he
[1:31:05] didn't say It's the End of Time and the
[1:31:08] start but in the Le leodan age it's the
[1:31:12] blending that's why for us in some ways
[1:31:15] we've entered into the eternity in some
[1:31:16] ways we've raptured in some ways we we
[1:31:19] have left Le oysa in some ways we've
[1:31:21] come up higher in some ways we've
[1:31:23] entered the bride AE in some ways all of
[1:31:25] these things are absolutely the truth
[1:31:27] but we're still in a blending
[1:31:31] period
[1:31:34] amen praise
[1:31:37] God oh my goodness what am I going to
[1:31:40] say
[1:31:45] next let's look here future home there's
[1:31:48] a couple statements brother brenon makes
[1:31:49] and I want to catch it if we look here
[1:31:52] in future home this is in uh
[1:31:54] August of uh 1964 we're in August early
[1:31:59] August and when the fullness of time has
[1:32:01] come that's when time has been fulfilled
[1:32:03] when there is no more time then you go
[1:32:05] into eternity after the seven Church
[1:32:07] ages is over and it
[1:32:11] is now we all understand English
[1:32:15] right after the seven Church ages is
[1:32:17] over and it is Luther's age is over
[1:32:20] Methodist age is over Pentecostal age is
[1:32:23] over and now you go into what eternity
[1:32:26] no more sevens no more threes no more
[1:32:28] other they're an eternity where there is
[1:32:30] no such as numbers and times and
[1:32:32] things praise God then he says and we
[1:32:36] realize that the Pentecostal Church age
[1:32:38] in the last days is the leot toan church
[1:32:40] age they're synonymous so the
[1:32:43] Pentecostal Church age is the leot toan
[1:32:45] church age now go back and he says the
[1:32:47] seventh Church age is over he says he
[1:32:50] says when there is no more more time
[1:32:52] then you go into eternity after the
[1:32:53] seven Church ages is over and it is
[1:32:57] Luther's AG is over Methodist age is
[1:32:59] over Pentecostal age is over and the
[1:33:00] Pentecostal age is the lean Church age
[1:33:02] so I read this quote and when I read
[1:33:04] this quote I go out as a as a fire brand
[1:33:07] preaching all over that leody deia is
[1:33:12] over and I I'm Justified because the
[1:33:15] prophet's not
[1:33:17] lying I've got him to back me up the L
[1:33:20] Church age is over
[1:33:26] brother man says now if I come with a
[1:33:27] message of Pentecost I would be in the
[1:33:30] leoan church age and it wouldn't be
[1:33:35] right this is July of 64 the other was
[1:33:39] August of 64 and so I'm totally
[1:33:42] justified in preaching what I want to
[1:33:44] preach about Ley of being over until I
[1:33:47] get later in August of 1964 and somebody
[1:33:51] asked a question brother Brenham you
[1:33:52] have made statements recently concerning
[1:33:54] the church age has ended
[1:33:57] leoda we just read those
[1:34:00] statements it's a good
[1:34:03] question he says no I never said it's
[1:34:06] ended if I did you misunderstood or I
[1:34:09] said it wrong this is the last Church
[1:34:11] age it's the end of the church age is
[1:34:13] the leoa it hasn't ended when it ends
[1:34:15] the church is gone so as long as the
[1:34:17] church is here it hasn't
[1:34:20] ended
[1:34:22] yes well now I'm
[1:34:26] confused unless somehow they're both
[1:34:31] true Unless
[1:34:33] somehow that Pentecostal age for the
[1:34:36] Bride of Jesus Christ has ended she has
[1:34:39] been caught up out of the
[1:34:41] denominationalism out of the whole
[1:34:44] problem that man slipped into a man's
[1:34:46] ideas and she's been restored back to a
[1:34:48] union with Christ she's been brought
[1:34:50] back to the word the original word that
[1:34:51] the fathers had so when she was brought
[1:34:53] back to the word she was lifted out of
[1:34:55] the church ages because the church ages
[1:34:57] is the record of people leaving the
[1:35:00] word the fall and the restoration but
[1:35:02] when it comes to the end you're restored
[1:35:04] now the Bride of Jesus Christ had the
[1:35:07] church ages have ended for the Bride of
[1:35:09] Jesus Christ brother bham tells us when
[1:35:11] the church Ages end then the seventh
[1:35:14] Angel's message comes and the seals open
[1:35:16] so the church ages have had to end but
[1:35:18] then he comes along and says I never
[1:35:20] said the Le Church age is
[1:35:22] over you either you misunderstood it or
[1:35:25] I said it wrong why because if we I
[1:35:29] listen I believe with all my heart for
[1:35:31] the bride Leo DEA is
[1:35:33] ended she's not blind wretched miserable
[1:35:37] naked she's received the isab she's
[1:35:40] clothed in the glory of the Lord clothed
[1:35:42] in his word she is not a Leo Dean if she
[1:35:45] was a leot she'd be wrong she's been
[1:35:48] lifted out of the denominationalism
[1:35:50] lifted out of the church age and United
[1:35:52] with Christ she is in the bride AE
[1:35:54] absolutely without a doubt but if I make
[1:35:56] that application that is true for the
[1:35:58] bride and if I blanket that statement
[1:36:00] over the whole world then I become wrong
[1:36:03] because Leo deia the leysia church age
[1:36:05] cannot end till tribulation and
[1:36:08] tribulation goes into the Millennium so
[1:36:10] if now the lean Church age is over
[1:36:13] either we're in the tribulation which is
[1:36:15] only for three and a half years or we're
[1:36:16] already in the
[1:36:20] millennium
[1:36:22] and if this is tribulation it's been
[1:36:24] pretty
[1:36:28] light and if this is the Millennium I'm
[1:36:30] somewhat
[1:36:37] disappointed so you
[1:36:39] see there's a prophecy in
[1:36:42] process time is blending with eternity
[1:36:46] the church ages is blending into the
[1:36:48] bride age which is not another church
[1:36:50] age that's why it doesn't receive an
[1:36:52] eight it's not number eight amen it's
[1:36:55] back to what the church was supposed to
[1:36:57] be at Pentecost but fell from so it's a
[1:36:59] restored back to its original condition
[1:37:02] and then moved on to the marriage that's
[1:37:05] what the bride age is it's not time it's
[1:37:08] not another number it's back into the
[1:37:10] Eternal purpose of God for a bride amen
[1:37:13] so I have the church has been
[1:37:16] resurrected I have been raptured I have
[1:37:18] been brought out of lead DEA in the
[1:37:20] bride age I've been United to
[1:37:22] Christ but does the bride age continue
[1:37:25] or does the lean Church age continue it
[1:37:27] must continue it can only end at the
[1:37:30] tribulation period which is a specific
[1:37:32] Mark of time of three and a half years
[1:37:35] and then after that a battle of
[1:37:36] Armageddon then after that a millennial
[1:37:38] reign of
[1:37:41] Christ
[1:37:43] am so you can see how these things are
[1:37:47] true it's all
[1:37:50] true but you can take the truth and be
[1:37:58] wrong so brother Chad how do we make
[1:38:01] sure we're right
[1:38:03] then I don't know maybe we just start by
[1:38:06] admitting we don't know it
[1:38:07] all maybe that's the easiest way so how
[1:38:11] how are we going to be right brother Tad
[1:38:12] this seems a little complicated to me I
[1:38:15] don't know all I know to say is maybe we
[1:38:18] don't have it all figured out and maybe
[1:38:19] we don't have all the answers and maybe
[1:38:20] we can't button it up really tightly but
[1:38:23] maybe the things that we know are true
[1:38:24] are
[1:38:25] true and we should rejoice and sing and
[1:38:28] dance and Shout about I've been lifted
[1:38:30] up out of Leo DEA I'm in the bride a I'm
[1:38:33] in The Invisible Union the Bride of the
[1:38:35] the the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:38:37] Christ has come to his bride amen he is
[1:38:39] here United that's absolutely absolutely
[1:38:42] the truth and let's sing too about
[1:38:44] something's going to change in my life
[1:38:46] I'm I I'm going to get a body change I'm
[1:38:48] not going to live like this the rest of
[1:38:50] my life I'm going to have a body that
[1:38:51] matches my soul and I'm going to live in
[1:38:53] the Millennium with Christ let's get
[1:38:55] excited about
[1:38:59] both brother B says this in the church
[1:39:01] age book says Thou shalt call and I will
[1:39:03] answer thee thou will have a desire to
[1:39:06] the work of thy hands thy great Shepherd
[1:39:07] is calling his Sheep by name the
[1:39:09] creative voice of God is calling them
[1:39:10] forth from the dust or changing their
[1:39:14] atoms even though they had not fallen
[1:39:16] asleep it is the rapture it is the great
[1:39:18] marriage supper of the lamb and his
[1:39:20] bride
[1:39:22] part of the Rapture is changing of your
[1:39:25] atoms says it again in the leosan church
[1:39:27] age but one day we will be changed in
[1:39:30] the atoms we will put on immortality we
[1:39:33] will be swallowed up in life then we
[1:39:36] will realize
[1:39:37] realization say brother brandham you
[1:39:39] already said that by the baptism of the
[1:39:41] Holy Ghost you've entered into the
[1:39:43] eighth day you're not even in the
[1:39:45] seventh day anymore you've entered into
[1:39:47] the eternals what are you talking about
[1:39:48] you're already imortal immortal
[1:39:52] absolutely but one day I'm going to be
[1:39:55] changed in the
[1:39:57] atams and that has nothing to do with my
[1:39:59] soul my soul has already changed but
[1:40:02] this flesh is going to change and I'm
[1:40:05] excited about
[1:40:08] both and God's provided place of worship
[1:40:10] he says and
[1:40:12] God has already raised us up
[1:40:15] potentially the quickening power that
[1:40:17] raised us from a life of sin and changed
[1:40:19] our being it has potentially raised us
[1:40:21] up in Christ Jesus which the
[1:40:23] resurrection will bring us forth fully
[1:40:27] matured there's going to be a finishing
[1:40:31] of this process that's right but I am
[1:40:36] not going to deny that the word has
[1:40:38] already
[1:40:40] come I am not waiting for something to
[1:40:43] happen what what is h what was what is
[1:40:45] going to happen is happening now and
[1:40:48] what is happening now will bring me to
[1:40:50] what will happen happen I'm not sitting
[1:40:52] on my heels or at the base of C sitting
[1:40:54] there waiting for something to happen no
[1:40:56] it's happening day by
[1:40:59] day how do you know the Rapture is not
[1:41:01] going on on all around you right
[1:41:04] now I'd say it is going on all around us
[1:41:08] right
[1:41:09] now so I just want to finish up with
[1:41:11] with just a thought here let's go to
[1:41:14] Hebrews
[1:41:19] 11
[1:41:25] Hebrews
[1:41:26] 11 let's go to verse
[1:41:39] 39 in Hebrews
[1:41:43] 11:39 and all and these all having
[1:41:46] obtained a good report through faith
[1:41:47] receive not the promise God having
[1:41:50] provided some better thing for us that
[1:41:52] they without us should not be made
[1:41:56] perfect they're not completed with us
[1:41:59] without
[1:42:00] us so God is finishing the prophecy the
[1:42:05] promise with
[1:42:07] us we're part of the Fulfillment of this
[1:42:15] prophecy brother brandham
[1:42:19] says
[1:42:21] let me let me just read out of things
[1:42:22] that are to
[1:42:24] be he said but the other one is called
[1:42:26] my father's house I'll go and prepare a
[1:42:27] place for you take you out of this pest
[1:42:29] house and deliver you into my father's
[1:42:31] house there you are take you out of this
[1:42:33] old Earthly pest house he's gone to
[1:42:35] prepare a place a perfect place where no
[1:42:37] evil exists no sickness exists no old
[1:42:40] age exists no death exist it's a perfect
[1:42:43] place calling you to that Perfection and
[1:42:45] you have to be perfect to get there the
[1:42:48] Bible said so Jesus said be therefore
[1:42:50] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:42:52] perfect it is a perfect Kingdom so it
[1:42:54] must be a perfect people come because
[1:42:57] you have to stand to be married to a
[1:42:58] perfect Son of God and you must be a
[1:42:59] perfect bride so how can you do it
[1:43:02] through anything else but the perfect
[1:43:03] word of God which is the Waters of
[1:43:05] Separation that washes us from our sins
[1:43:08] amen that's right the blood of Jesus
[1:43:09] Christ think of it the dripping bloody
[1:43:11] word and the word of God bleeding blood
[1:43:13] to wash the bride and yes sir she stands
[1:43:16] perfect virgin
[1:43:19] unadulterated
[1:43:22] Amen brother bam tells us he says in the
[1:43:25] message he says U I think the invisible
[1:43:28] union he said you are the perfect
[1:43:32] virtuous virgin bride of Jesus
[1:43:37] Christ because why he's washed Us in his
[1:43:39] blood he's purchased us when he looks
[1:43:41] through the blood he can't see our
[1:43:43] faults when he looks through the blood
[1:43:45] we're perfect amen we are perfect in his
[1:43:48] eyes perfect in his vision perfect
[1:43:50] because of the
[1:43:51] blood but yet the word has come to make
[1:43:54] us
[1:43:55] perfect to wash us from the filth of the
[1:43:58] press through spirits to wash all the
[1:44:00] filth of the world away and cleanse us
[1:44:01] and purify us and change our hearts and
[1:44:04] change our mind and bring us into that
[1:44:06] Perfect Image he had of a bride amen
[1:44:08] we're being perfected by the word but it
[1:44:10] was the word who bled and died for us
[1:44:12] that made us perfect to begin
[1:44:17] with but yet we're in the process
[1:44:22] brother B says in the rising of the sun
[1:44:23] he said' and the sun has got to be
[1:44:25] revealed
[1:44:26] again in the bride in the last day so
[1:44:30] the sun has got to be revealed again
[1:44:32] where in the
[1:44:34] bride the quickening power has got to
[1:44:36] come Quicken them out of these dead
[1:44:38] denominations and Creeds to a Living
[1:44:40] Word of the Living God so now the the
[1:44:45] word has to purify has to perfect has to
[1:44:48] wash a bride and perfect
[1:44:51] amen why because they without us are not
[1:44:54] yet made perfect he's coming the the sun
[1:44:56] has got to be revealed again in the
[1:44:58] bride he's got to come in the bride form
[1:45:01] amen but but for him to be revealed in
[1:45:03] the bride it's going to take a whole lot
[1:45:05] of Shaving down and washing for us amen
[1:45:07] so that we can come to a yielded place
[1:45:10] where we can come to a surrender to the
[1:45:11] word where he can be revealed in
[1:45:15] us because he can't be revealed in us
[1:45:17] with things of the world hanging on he
[1:45:19] can't be revealed in us with old
[1:45:21] denominational ideas hanging on Amen
[1:45:24] there's got to be a washing away of all
[1:45:26] of these things so he can be more and
[1:45:28] more and more revealed in our
[1:45:31] lives this bride has got to come to
[1:45:34] Perfection and what's bringing her to
[1:45:36] Perfection this word that we've already
[1:45:37] received but it's the word that bled and
[1:45:39] died for us it's the word that's already
[1:45:40] declared us perfect is the word that's
[1:45:42] making us
[1:45:44] perfect it's a prophecy in
[1:45:48] process when we look at the
[1:45:51] the Rapture brother R tells us the
[1:45:53] Rapture is a process starts with a shout
[1:45:56] the message going forth calling out a
[1:45:58] bride Gathering a bride and it's the
[1:46:00] voice the voice of the Archangel say
[1:46:02] it's the same
[1:46:03] voice that called Lazarus from the dead
[1:46:07] then the Trump is the resurrection of
[1:46:09] the sleeping Saints and the translation
[1:46:10] of the body and the Gathering into the
[1:46:12] other
[1:46:13] dimension all it's I'm sorry it's the
[1:46:16] Gathering it's a summoning to the other
[1:46:17] dimension it's the translation of our
[1:46:18] bodies the voice is is what brings them
[1:46:21] out of the ground but he said they
[1:46:23] without us are not yet made perfect amen
[1:46:26] so there's a perfecting by the word
[1:46:28] that's taking place that's why we come
[1:46:31] every Sunday and Wednesday not you say
[1:46:32] I've entered into the eternals I'm
[1:46:34] perfect by the blood of the Lamb I've
[1:46:36] arrived no you
[1:46:38] haven't that's why you have trials and
[1:46:40] tribulations and that's why you keep
[1:46:41] coming back every Sunday and Wednesday
[1:46:43] and that's why God keeps opening more
[1:46:44] and more of his word to us why he's
[1:46:46] washing Us in why there was parts of us
[1:46:48] that couldn't be washed he had to get
[1:46:49] through the outer Gunk to get to the
[1:46:51] inner
[1:46:52] Gunk and there was a word that washed
[1:46:54] the outer Gunk and then there's a word
[1:46:55] that comes and washes the inner Gunk and
[1:46:57] now he's got to get to the inner of the
[1:46:58] inner Gunk but he's got to he's cleaning
[1:47:00] Us by layers and he's bringing us down
[1:47:03] why because he's got to come he's got to
[1:47:05] be displayed again in the end time in
[1:47:07] the bride and she's got to be able to
[1:47:09] manifest that word and in order to do it
[1:47:11] everything's got to be washed away she's
[1:47:13] got to be washed away of her habit she's
[1:47:15] got to be washed away of dressing wrong
[1:47:17] talking wrong but then she's got to be
[1:47:18] washed away of thinking wrong and
[1:47:20] reacting wrong and her complex has got
[1:47:22] to get washed and the hurts that are
[1:47:24] deep in her heart why because he's going
[1:47:26] to display himself in her and the
[1:47:29] washing of the water of the word is
[1:47:31] purifying and cleansing all of us in and
[1:47:35] out it's a prophecy in
[1:47:38] process brother made this statement back
[1:47:40] in 1961 and I just want to drop it in
[1:47:43] here because I I feel like it's so
[1:47:44] pertinent he said all right here was
[1:47:47] voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville
[1:47:49] thousands of lived voices the Thunder of
[1:47:52] God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:47:54] Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking
[1:47:57] around in the Earth today without a
[1:47:59] blemish you see all those
[1:48:01] statements what's it going to take to
[1:48:03] get us in that position it's going to
[1:48:05] take the washing of the water of this
[1:48:07] revealed
[1:48:08] word yes sir real Christians that's
[1:48:11] Thunder against the enemy the devil
[1:48:13] don't care how loud you can holler the
[1:48:15] devil don't care how much you can jump
[1:48:17] or how much you can do this or shout but
[1:48:19] What Hurts The Devil is this see that
[1:48:20] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[1:48:24] say anything to him call him anything
[1:48:26] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:48:28] right
[1:48:29] on you know what I read that statement
[1:48:32] I've read that for years I've Loved this
[1:48:34] quote for many
[1:48:36] years but you get to this point he says
[1:48:39] say anything to him call him anything
[1:48:41] just as sweet as it can
[1:48:43] be I haven't been manifesting that for
[1:48:48] years amen I've been believing it I've
[1:48:52] been saying it needs to be but but my
[1:48:54] reactions are always as sweet as can
[1:48:58] be I mean I've not gotten to the place
[1:49:01] where somebody can say anything and do
[1:49:03] anything and my response was just as
[1:49:05] sweet as could
[1:49:07] be but that's the direction I'm heading
[1:49:10] in by the grace of God that's his
[1:49:13] purpose in this day is to wash a people
[1:49:17] wash them and cleanse them and to step
[1:49:19] inside of them and to manifest
[1:49:24] himself but brother said this is what we
[1:49:27] need what this is what hurts the devil
[1:49:30] What Hurts The Devil is not yelling at
[1:49:32] him and calling him a
[1:49:34] devil doesn't hurt him What Hurts The
[1:49:37] Devil is to see that Sanctified holy
[1:49:40] life consecrated to God say anything to
[1:49:43] him call him anything just as sweet as
[1:49:45] can be and move right on oh my that
[1:49:48] throws him away that's the Thunder that
[1:49:50] shakes the
[1:49:52] devil just like what you say if I could
[1:49:54] preach like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts
[1:49:55] or somebody a great influential speaker
[1:49:58] oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at
[1:50:00] that he don't pay no more attention to
[1:50:01] that than nothing you you get all the
[1:50:04] theology you want to and all the
[1:50:05] Seminary training and the devil just
[1:50:07] sits back and laugh at it but when he
[1:50:10] sees that
[1:50:12] life that's the goal that's what we're
[1:50:15] striving for that's why we're still here
[1:50:18] that's why God is still working on us
[1:50:19] and transforming us why the we've we've
[1:50:23] already resurrected potentially we we've
[1:50:26] already been caught up into Heavenly
[1:50:27] places hey but but that quickening power
[1:50:30] that came to Quicken us to life is also
[1:50:32] quickening this Mortal body to match the
[1:50:35] word yes the quickening power that
[1:50:37] brought us into the eternities by the
[1:50:39] baptism of holy ghost that quickening
[1:50:41] power is working on this flesh to bring
[1:50:43] it in line with the word as
[1:50:49] well
[1:50:51] and we
[1:50:52] know that brother B told
[1:50:57] us that in the leian church
[1:51:02] age he
[1:51:05] said in the church age book he said the
[1:51:09] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:51:10] God is its own mouthpiece so God is
[1:51:13] turning on her he will confound her
[1:51:15] through the prophet and the bride for
[1:51:16] the voice of God will be in her yes it
[1:51:18] is for it says in the last chapter of
[1:51:20] Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride
[1:51:22] say come once more the world will hear
[1:51:24] direct from God as at Pentecost but of
[1:51:27] course that word bride will be
[1:51:28] repudiated as in that first
[1:51:31] age how will the world hear from the
[1:51:34] bride it may not be just what comes out
[1:51:37] of your
[1:51:38] mouth but it's that
[1:51:40] life say anything you want to him do
[1:51:43] anything just to sweetest can
[1:51:45] be I say God bring me to perfection you
[1:51:50] who have declared me perfect already
[1:51:52] bring me to Perfection you have called
[1:51:55] me your spotless sinless virtuous bride
[1:51:59] when you say you're glorious and there's
[1:52:01] no fault that's his Declaration of the
[1:52:03] Bride you've already spoken that over me
[1:52:05] I already have that position by
[1:52:07] predestination yes now in this Earthly
[1:52:10] Journey bring me into that image amen so
[1:52:13] that I can reflect what you've already
[1:52:14] done on the inside can it reflect on the
[1:52:17] outside so that you can get Glory let it
[1:52:20] be the Thunder that shakes the
[1:52:22] devil brother BM says in the message
[1:52:27] desperations he says and all the things
[1:52:29] that he has that he hasn't done down
[1:52:32] through the ages in the church ages he
[1:52:33] is now doing back to the word because
[1:52:36] the messages and the messages and the
[1:52:38] messages has to wind up in the entire
[1:52:40] word and in the last days the Seven
[1:52:42] Seals being opened was to pick up every
[1:52:44] straggle that's been left off of it and
[1:52:46] make the whole thing in one great big
[1:52:48] body of the Bride that them who lived
[1:52:50] back there was not perfect until this
[1:52:53] church be perfected this brid group in
[1:52:55] the last days to bring them in and all
[1:52:58] together be taken up now we know why God
[1:53:02] brought such a message in this end time
[1:53:04] because he's going to display himself
[1:53:06] through a people and he had to bring a
[1:53:08] word that'll produce that
[1:53:11] result so what are we supposed to do lay
[1:53:14] in the presence of the son and let this
[1:53:16] word this message bake all the greenness
[1:53:18] out amen you realize when we look at the
[1:53:21] Exodus we went back to Genesis and we
[1:53:23] read the prophecy that was given to
[1:53:25] Abraham and now God comes on the scene
[1:53:27] and he brings Moses to fulfill that
[1:53:28] prophecy and bring them out with a
[1:53:30] mighty hand judge that nation that
[1:53:32] persecuted him bring them through with a
[1:53:34] great spoil and take them into the land
[1:53:36] well they find themselves like I said
[1:53:38] dancing on the banks of the Red Sea
[1:53:40] rejoicing because God had kept his
[1:53:43] word but yet there was more to
[1:53:46] come now they needed to go in and
[1:53:48] possess that land
[1:53:50] but that group that came out they needed
[1:53:52] some shaving
[1:53:54] down they needed some attitude
[1:53:58] adjustments they needed to trust the
[1:54:01] Lord so God would take them through many
[1:54:04] experiences in the 40-year journey and
[1:54:07] they would go through the bitter Waters
[1:54:09] that were turned
[1:54:11] sweet they would they would they would
[1:54:14] see the failure of
[1:54:16] ministry when Aaron pushed by the people
[1:54:20] took them back to idolatry yes they saw
[1:54:23] the failure of Moses when he exalted
[1:54:25] himself when he became angry and was
[1:54:27] withheld from the promised
[1:54:29] land they saw uh the the anger of the
[1:54:33] Lord in judgment when they when they
[1:54:35] when they complained against the Lord
[1:54:37] and he sent fiery serpents among them
[1:54:40] but then they saw the salvation of the
[1:54:42] Lord when he provided a Brazen
[1:54:45] serpent when they cried for quail he
[1:54:49] provided when they were attacked by
[1:54:50] enemies he defeated
[1:54:53] them all this
[1:54:56] journey it was all doing something it
[1:55:00] was all building something it was
[1:55:02] molding something everything they go
[1:55:04] went through there was a new generation
[1:55:06] coming up what was happening the the the
[1:55:10] the the thinking of Egypt the slave
[1:55:12] mentality the thing they've been bound
[1:55:14] in It's Beginning to leave circumstance
[1:55:17] by circumstance by circumstance yes
[1:55:19] until you find people who hit a hardship
[1:55:22] they want to go right back to Egypt
[1:55:23] because at least we had something to eat
[1:55:25] at Egypt and now you come to a new
[1:55:27] generation that comes up and they're
[1:55:28] sharpening swords and they can't wait to
[1:55:30] go into the promised
[1:55:32] land what happened there was something
[1:55:35] there was a prophecy in process but the
[1:55:37] process was doing something it was
[1:55:39] preparing a people to step into the
[1:55:41] furtherment of the
[1:55:44] prophecy we've been in a prophecy and
[1:55:46] process for 60 plus years now but what
[1:55:49] God been doing doing he's been doing all
[1:55:50] the same things he did in the Exodus
[1:55:52] Journey we've seen all of those things
[1:55:55] and those of you who've been around
[1:55:56] longer than I've been around you've seen
[1:55:58] them all you've seen the failure of
[1:55:59] ministry you've seen Ministry exalt
[1:56:01] themselves you've seen Ministry given to
[1:56:02] the wants of the people you've seen
[1:56:04] people complain you've seen people turn
[1:56:07] back you've seen the Judgment of God and
[1:56:09] you've seen the mercy of God you've seen
[1:56:11] the provision of God you've seen fear
[1:56:13] that comes when an enemy comes and
[1:56:15] you've seen God raise up some in the
[1:56:16] camp to defeat the enemy You' SE you've
[1:56:20] seen Rebellion against god-given
[1:56:21] Authority and what happens to
[1:56:27] them who's been around for a
[1:56:29] while have you seen those
[1:56:33] things what was it well we thought it
[1:56:37] was
[1:56:39] time we thought that he had come we
[1:56:42] thought it was the
[1:56:44] Rapture but now it's been 60
[1:56:48] years no this is still the
[1:56:50] Rapture this is still the coming of the
[1:56:53] Lord he's coming in Bride form he's
[1:56:56] still coming to Greater manifestation
[1:56:58] all the time as what as we travel
[1:57:00] through all of this we're still smack
[1:57:02] dab in the middle of the prophecy
[1:57:04] friends we're not waiting we're here we
[1:57:07] say coming yeah there's more to be
[1:57:09] fulfilled but what's being fulfilled is
[1:57:11] happening right now day by day all
[1:57:13] around us he's here uniting with his
[1:57:16] bride well well it sounds good he's here
[1:57:18] uniting with me

[1:57:25] to be uniting in this marriage in a
[1:57:27] greater way every day I wanted to be a

[1:58:01] here uniting with his bride he is here
[1:58:05] taking us back
[1:58:07] home we're walking with him in the
[1:58:11] middle of a
[1:58:12] prophecy the prophecy in
[1:58:15] process we're not going to fight about
[1:58:17] either side they're both
[1:58:20] true we're not going to argue that
[1:58:23] brother B needs to come back to finish
[1:58:24] some things that are unfinished no he
[1:58:25] did everything he needs to do but
[1:58:28] there's some things that are unfinished
[1:58:29] yeah there's some things that are
[1:58:30] unfinished I agree with you but God's
[1:58:33] finishing them
[1:58:34] now where is he doing it he's doing it
[1:58:37] in his bride he's completing the
[1:58:39] ministry he's completing the work he's
[1:58:41] finishing everything that he need it's
[1:58:43] happening right now we are exactly
[1:58:47] listen friends we are exactly L where
[1:58:50] Mary
[1:58:52] was Mary was in the word made flesh in
[1:58:58] her flesh yes but there was still part
[1:59:01] of the prophecy to come to
[1:59:03] pass but it had already come to pass and
[1:59:06] it was still to come to pass and where
[1:59:08] was Mary Mary was the living word for
[1:59:11] her day she was a manifested word word
[1:59:14] for her day and the Fulfillment of
[1:59:16] Isaiah 7 and she was it amen
[1:59:19] was still some to
[1:59:23] come that's where we're at friends and
[1:59:26] I'm excited about the whole process I'm
[1:59:29] so excited you know you say well how
[1:59:31] long brother how long I don't know how
[1:59:33] long but I know there's two things
[1:59:35] that's got to happen before it finishes
[1:59:37] one the last predestinated seed has to
[1:59:39] come in and Unite with Christ and two
[1:59:41] I've got to come to a greater level of
[1:59:42] perfection than I am right now so what
[1:59:45] am I excited about I'm excited about
[1:59:47] what I'm going to learn today and what
[1:59:48] I'm going to learn tomorrow tomorrow and
[1:59:49] what the word's going to open and you
[1:59:51] say but sometimes the opening of the
[1:59:52] word exposes bad parts in me well praise
[1:59:54] God they got to get out so we can
[1:59:57] go I'm excited what God's going to show
[2:00:00] me through the next trial through the
[2:00:01] next blessing through the next time his
[2:00:03] word is made manifest through the next
[2:00:04] time somebody preaches through the next
[2:00:06] testimony I'm excited why because I'm
[2:00:09] right smack dab in the middle of the
[2:00:11] process and the whole thing is a thrill
[2:00:13] to me Mary was carrying she was carrying
[2:00:17] the Son of God she was carrying a manual
[2:00:19] inside of her it was such a thrill I
[2:00:22] think I think it would be a privilege
[2:00:24] even to have
[2:00:25] cravings
[2:00:29] right just got to have this yeah why
[2:00:32] because the word inside of me is craving
[2:00:35] it it's a thrill to become uncomfortable
[2:00:39] as the word begins to grow and take over
[2:00:41] her life now she can't sleep on her left
[2:00:43] side now what what is it this thing's
[2:00:45] taking over and it's taking over praise
[2:00:47] God what a privilege for Mary to be the
[2:00:50] the word made flesh and whatever she had
[2:00:52] to sacrifice and whatever she had to
[2:00:54] give up and whatever resentment the
[2:00:56] people had and whatever
[2:00:57] uncomfortableness it made inside of her
[2:00:59] praise be to God it was all
[2:01:08] exciting I wish I could interview
[2:01:11] Mary I'd love to
[2:01:14] know if she was ever
[2:01:17] uncomfortable had pain yeah was in
[2:01:20] discomfort was judged had her heart
[2:01:23] broken yeah yeah was rejected by
[2:01:28] family I wonder how labor
[2:01:32] was was it just
[2:01:35] easy
[2:01:36] simple like she was shocked and the baby
[2:01:39] was
[2:01:40] here or was it
[2:01:43] difficult was it a
[2:01:46] trial I'd love to interview her and ask
[2:01:48] her
[2:01:52] we are that
[2:01:55] Merry is it sometimes
[2:01:58] uncomfortable do you have to sacrifice
[2:02:00] some things to be the Fulfillment of the
[2:02:03] word
[2:02:05] yes but it's
[2:02:07] exciting it's a thrill it's an absolute
[2:02:10] privilege I'm so excited I believe it
[2:02:13] with all my heart and I can't wait to
[2:02:15] see the rest of this word
[2:02:17] fulfilled praise be to God as she got
[2:02:21] more pregnant and more pregnant and the
[2:02:23] word grew and grew inside of her no
[2:02:25] doubt if it was normal like a normal
[2:02:27] pregnancy she became more
[2:02:29] uncomfortable but as she became more
[2:02:31] uncomfortable she became more
[2:02:37] excited I I want that to be my life I
[2:02:42] want to be smack dab in the middle of
[2:02:44] the prophecy where the prophecy is
[2:02:45] working its way out in
[2:02:47] me and I want to give my life and I want
[2:02:49] to be enthused and excited about every
[2:02:52] part of it because I know what he's done
[2:02:55] I know what he's doing and I'm excited
[2:02:57] about what's
[2:03:00] coming I love this prophecy in process
[2:03:05] amen God bless you all let's all
[2:03:11] stand you know the when the opening of
[2:03:14] the
[2:03:17] seals ended the mystery of God but it
[2:03:19] also ended some mysteries for us the
[2:03:22] mystery of our life the mystery of what
[2:03:24] God's doing the mystery of what's going
[2:03:26] on all around us the opening of the word
[2:03:28] also alleviated some mysteries for
[2:03:31] us Mary had a lot of mysteries
[2:03:33] alleviated in that Angel's message and
[2:03:36] she knew what her life's purpose was she
[2:03:38] knew why she was on the planet she knew
[2:03:40] what she was to do she knew what was
[2:03:41] happening she didn't know everything but
[2:03:44] she knew a lot and here we are by an
[2:03:47] angel's message telling us that we are
[2:03:48] are that fulfillment of the word we are
[2:03:50] the word made flesh we are the prophecy
[2:03:53] alive today and and we know so much
[2:03:55] because of that Angel's message and so
[2:03:57] much is open there's still a lot we're
[2:03:59] not sure about yet but praise God I'm
[2:04:02] excited anyhow amen let's bow our heads
