[0:01] There can be one in the
[0:03] bed who has the revelation that Christ
[0:06] has taken his proper place on my heart
[0:09] because I am his redeemed subject and he
[0:11] is on the throne of my heart. And there
[0:14] can be another in the field who says I
[0:17] don't see anybody coming. I haven't
[0:18] heard
[0:19] anything. There can be one at the mill
[0:24] grinding. You understand? Amen. The same
[0:27] can be true for the gentile bride.
[0:32] Christ has left the intercessory
[0:35] seat for me. Amen. Because he's came
[0:39] came and he's claimed me. Amen.
[0:43] There may be somebody walking that door
[0:45] in five minutes that Christ has got to
[0:48] still be on the inter intercessory seat
[0:50] in their lives. Amen. And that is
[0:52] perfectly fine. Amen. Amen. Amen. But
[0:56] there'll be a day after he's interceded
[0:59] for them and they've come to the
[1:00] recognition of their sacrifice and
[1:01] accepted it, he's going to move off of
[1:03] his intercessory seat and claim them by
[1:07] moving onto the throne of their heart.
[1:11] Amen. Praise God. Let's not get bogged
[1:13] down on where is it? Where it's like we
[1:16] Oh, mercy. It's like we think God has to
[1:19] be in a box and we got to move him from
[1:23] one place. No, no. We're a gentile
[1:27] people, a spiritual relationship. He can
[1:31] be in many different manifestations and
[1:35] capacities and offices re depending on
[1:38] what individual he's dealing with.
[1:41] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:45] But I thank God
[1:47] that as of
[1:49] 1963, the opportunity
[1:54] for him to move from just an intercessor
[1:58] and my savior
[2:01] to my bridegroom,
[2:04] to my husband,
[2:07] to my redeemer. Amen.
[2:11] That
[2:13] opportunity came into existence in 1963.
[2:17] Amen. I don't know how many people
[2:19] caught it then. I'm willing to bet it
[2:21] was a few. That's right. But I'm also
[2:24] willing to bet there's a lot more who've
[2:26] caught it since then. Amen. Amen, sir.
[2:29] And that by no means means that somebody
[2:32] else can't catch the revelation of him
[2:35] being their intercessor.
[2:37] It's still available.
[2:39] Amen. So long as one of his children
[2:42] needs him to be an intercessor, he's
[2:44] still an intercessor on the throne.
[2:46] Amen. Praise God. But as time winds down
[2:49] and dispensation changes,
[2:54] there's going to come a point in time
[2:55] that each of his children, his elect
[2:57] bride, comes to the recognition, I'm
[3:01] just not a sinner saved by grace. I am a
[3:04] sinner saved by grace, but I'm not just
[3:06] a sinner saved by grace. Praise God.
[3:08] Amen. I was actually in his mind before
[3:10] the foundation of the world. He has
[3:12] actually left his father's throne and
[3:15] came and sat on my throne. And now I
[3:18] live my daily life riding on this power
[3:22] following this one who has fire and word
[3:26] and a sword coming out of his mouth.
[3:28] Amen.
