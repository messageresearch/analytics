========================================

but as you go spiritually in the message of the hour you experience amazing things uh that that most people on this planet uh uh uh could never experience um you you experience the presence of god in a way that most people will never have the privilege of experiencing the vast majority of the people on the earth will never be in the midst of a group of believers who are worshiping god as they should and and praising the lord jesus christ and you have that privilege and not only that you you have that privilege several times a week and you step into that and you experience that and you go through that and you have that that that honor of being in that presence you grow in grace and acknowledge and you're you you you are the grace the only grace that the world will ever experience you and and your relationship with christ and them seeing who you are is the is the only grace that they will ever see and you are that grace to them you as a as a result of your uh uh relationship with christ as a result of the presence of god in our midst uh uh you are hidden from the storm that that rages in the hearts of everyone that does not know the goodness of christ you are hidden from that storm and when we think we have problems we are hidden from so much and and however 2020 has impacted you you are hidden and and hidden under the wing of of christ more than you realize you are kept from evil more than you realize god won't tent you more than what you can bear but you are kept from the evil one much more than you could ever understand and then the enemy that lurks in the shadows and and wants to pounce on you and is kept by the grace and mercy of god and you have that privilege you fight the enemy on a daily on an hourly basis but you don't fight the victory fight the enemy for victory you fight the enemy from a position of victory you are victorious you are an invincible army and thus you fight the enemy not for the victory not for the win you fight from a position of the win you've already got the win
