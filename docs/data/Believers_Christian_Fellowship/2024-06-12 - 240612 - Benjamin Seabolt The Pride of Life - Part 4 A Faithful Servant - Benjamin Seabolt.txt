there and uh Blake led us in some songs and we sang several songs and and she raised her little hands and worshiped the Lord with us and we could hear her voice joining with the arm and we had a wonderful time and everybody had the chance to hug her and kiss her and tell her goodbye and we knew that she wasn't well but that next week she really deteriorated they moved her to a hospice care

I don't know about you but I'm hungry for more of the word of God this life is just a vapor just a mist and we've come to the the reality of that as a family lately but there's one thing that'll endure forever and that's the word of God there's one thing that's worth giving our whole lives to and that's the word of God and his purpose in our lives and I'm so thankful that he's revealing to us our purpose purpose and he's taking the veil away if all we had is this life we would be of All Creatures most miserable but thank God Amen we're here to fulfill a purpose we're here to gain character we're here to display his attributes and part of that he's unveiling himself to give us the power the strength the understanding to do so and I thank God for his word I thank God for his people I see God in all of you amen God bless you let's just sing as we invite brother Benjamin will hear I Am Lord here I am here I am I give all myself to thee Lord here I am Am Here I Am Lord here I am here I

speak to me let your spirit move through me Lord speak to me let's bow our heads together precious Lord Jesus we're truly grateful once again for this opportunity that you've given us to gather together Lord father it's so easy to get lost in the shuffle and get lost in the busyness and the cares of Life Lord and things can just become a tradition to us father but may we come here tonight and just refocus ourself and understand that we're not here just out of tradition we're not here for a social Gathering we're not here just for church Lord but you could strip this building away from us you could strip these microphones away from us you could strip everything from around us Lord and we would still be your church here this evening Lord and our assembling and our gathering together is for two purposes Lord to give you the praise that you are so worthy to receive collectively Lord and your Worthy that and we want to fulfill our role in that Lord but also secondly for you to come and to speak to us and to reveal yourself to us and to reveal ourselves to ourselves Lord that we would know what we need to do differently and what we would need to change and how we would could be molded into your character father so may we approach this service tonight with that in mind Lord to worship you both in spirit and in truth not just to sing songs of praise and then go out unchanged father but to truly worship you to prostrate oursel to lay oursel before you the revealed word and submit oursel to that we would just ask that you would come Lord we know this is your method even though we're not worthy or even capable but that you would come and stir up a gift within and take the bread of life Lord and feed your hungry children just pray that you would give us ears to hear Lord and a heart to perceive as we would yield ourselves completely to you this evening the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles we'll turn to the book of Philippians chapter 2 hopefully this is starting to become a little bit of a familiar scripture to you Philippians chapter 2 beginning in verse three and I would just like to continue this thought on the pride of life this evening with a uh subtitle of a faithful servant so we're still very much focused on the pride of life but we want to look at a faithful servant in comparison to that Philippians chapter 2 beginning in verse three says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of mine Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross God bless you as you would have your seats this evening we're just going to read a couple things here by way of review but I don't intend to T too long with that in the Book of Ezekiel 2: 2 we see an example of the contrast and the direct opposite anointing that was on Jesus Christ it says son of man say unto the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou Hast said I am a God I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet thou art a man and not God though thou Hast set thine heart as the heart of God and then verse 17 thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness and I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee so we can see the characteristics that Christ demonstrated who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but that Revelation caused him to Humble himself to take upon himself and make up make himself of no reputation and then we see uh we know this is spiritually applying to Satan here Lucifer and we see that him being nobody made himself somebody so he did exactly opposite of what the Son of God did the Son of God was somebody and we've said before he was literally the only person who could come with a reputation and would be honest about it and would not be puffing himself up it was what it was he was the son of go God and he was worthy of any reputation that would be given him as far as a high in a high esteem but here we have Lucifer who is a created being and should be and should be subject to the characteristics of the god that created him but he deviated from that and somehow in the brightness and in his own Beauty defaulted from the brightness of the wisdom that he had so this Revelation that he caught of himself somehow made him miss the entire picture of who he actually was and now as a result of this Revelation he starts speaking things and these things although he believed them and was stating them as fact these things were actually lies and the scripture says he says that you you have said thou Hast said I am a God but he wasn't right but he was saying that right it says I sit in the seat of God in the midst of the Seas says but yet thou art a man you are a created being amen great not a god even though he would declare that so we can see the contrast between the two characteristics and remember in that script second scripture that we read there the issue was in thine heart in thine heart you have said this so even if he would have never acted upon this even if he would have never manifested this externally the problem was still in his heart he had taken a wrong opinion he had caught a wrong Revelation right Proverbs 6:16 these six these six things doeth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him number one a proud look number two a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood and heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift and running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among Brethren I'd venture to say that Lucifer Lucifer fulfilled all of those even in his heart he fulfilled all of those 1 John 2:15 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world then I'm going to read this quote to you we've read it almost every time but just to refresh you of where this inspiration is stemming from 1953 go tell my disciples brother brandham said speaking of Mary so she had Seven Devils cast out of her pride and envy and she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her it's really hard for me not to preach on this every service and just take the entire service on this one quote because there's so many facets that you can go into and there is so many uh it's just like a cobweb when you start dealing into this pride of life everywhere that it goes and cobwebs and rabbit trails and ant hills and everything else that you can throw in there there it just encompasses so much when a when a prophet now comes and picks up something out of the scriptures and sets that new standard before us so now we don't have to wonder well what was the Devils that was cast out of her and how did those manifest how did those uh represent themselves now a prophet can come and pick up this scripture and this example and tell us that one of these Devils was pride and that Pride was representing itself and manifesting itself simply by her thinking that she was so pretty and there was nobody like her and as I've said multiple times before once the standard is clear not what we think pride is yeah not what we think that we manifest Pride as but now when a prophet comes and presents the real standard now we can appropriately compare Our Lives to that now we can appropriately compare our character to that now we can appropriately compare our thought processes and what is in our heart to that because we can say that we're not prideful but are you not prideful to what your own standard or maybe another standard that somebody has set to you you're not prideful compared to this person yeah but we're always going to come up short unless we have the real standard the appropriate standard given by one who is an authority to give the standard amen and I thank God that we've had an authority to give us a standard yes and you know what that may be a hard statement but I find in myself that I don't have a problem with a new standard I find myself even when I read this and I told you I've told you before it you know really wrecked my life which was a good thing but even as hard as this was and as difficult as it was coming and recognizing how short that I came to this new standard I was still at the end of the day grateful that now I have the appropriate standard now I can at least start moving forward because in the past my eyes were just blind to it and I'm just walking around blind to it and and we know the prophet gave that example that if you have a man who just wants to tuck himself in the basement and and declare there's no sun there's no like there's not much you can do to help that individual if if he's wanting to be blind yeah but if you find an individual that's blind and he's walking out stumbling and he he's half-dressed you know if you can get him to recognize there's a problem then you can help that individual and this is what God has done for us Saints we came to this Earth with spiritual Amnesia we came to this Earth with complexes in DNA that we never really ask for but the problem with that is when it's in your DNA and it's made into you the the scripture says that every man in his own heart says that he's fine says that he's right every man in his own eyes thinks that he's right we can't recognize that now we can recognize it pretty easily and everybody else but because we're wired the way we're wired we just it's kind of like a black black Zone there we can't properly identify what we need to properly identify so the point that I'm making is we have to have this because even if we can discern nine things out of 10 there's going to be number 10 that you miss you're not going to be able to properly discern yourself even the scripture says that the heart is exceeding Wicked who can discern it who can know it so we have to have an authority come on the scene and declare these standards to us so that we can even get off first base so we then so that we can start down the right path because if not we're just we're a hopeless cause that's right so I'm grateful for that I'm thankful for that so when we have this standard brought it may be a tough standard and no doubt this is not the last tough standard that's going to be clarified to us I'm sure there's further clarification coming in the message that we're going to return to the woe is me stage but that's okay that's okay there's there's nothing wrong with coming to the wo is me stage there's a point behind that there's a process behind that but what I'm most grateful for is now that I've got eyes to see so I don't have a problem with a standard I don't have a problem lining up to that I don't have any resistance into me well maybe that's not exactly how it manifested no when I read that I said that's exactly the truth and I'm in a really bad position because I've got a lot of shaping up to do but that doesn't change the fact that this is the truth this is the standard this is the way that it is this Rings true to me and I want to line up to that he says but Jesus spoke and said be thou clean and all that left her she became a new person she wasn't so pretty anymore in her own sight and this is the key remember the the outward appearance no doubt did not change I'm sure maybe her dress changed and so forth but as I said I'm sure her facial features did not just mag magically you know become ugly in her own sight she wasn't so pretty anymore but she wrapped herself in the robe of meekness and gentleness and followed the master okay there's your review let's get going 2 Samuel chapter 3 2 Samuel chapter 3 you might want to keep your Bibles handy because we're going to be reading quite a bit of scripture um we're probably going to skip through through some of this just for the sake of time but we'll give you enough to know where we're reading at and where we're coming from I'm also going to apologize in advance we're in the Old Testament and there are names here that I don't have a clue how to say so I'm not going to apologize every time that I mess one up just understand that I'm probably going to mess up all of them and you can find it in the Bible yourself and you can figure out how to pronounce it but I'm probably going to just sound it out and you'll get the point and just forgive me for my ignorance but um it's just the way that it is verse 6 and it came to pass there was war between the house of Saul and the House of David so this is after Saul has died just to give you a little understanding where we're at Saul has died but the kingdom has not been reconciled to David yet came to pass there was war and that between Saul and the House of David and that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul so this is captain of the host in Saul's former Kingdom and Saul had a concubine whose name was rea rispa the daughter of aah and ishes said to Abner wherefore hast thou gone in to my father's concubine then was Abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth so ishbosheth is Saul's son Abner's captain of the host Abner is kind of keeping everything together here since Saul has passed away and now one of Saul's Sons comes to Abner and says why have you went into my father's concubine then was Abner very Roth for the words of ishbosheth and said am I a dog's head which against Judah do show kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father to his Brethren and to his friends and have not derived thee into the hand of David that thou charges me today with a fault concerning this woman in 2024 terms how dare you he says so do God to Abner and more also except as the Lord hath sworn to David even so do I to him to translate the Kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the Throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan even to BBA and he could not answer abnar a word again because he feared him so this gentleman comes accuses Abner Abner of something that he has not done Abner says how dare you I'm the one that's holding everything together here and because you've done this you're done I am now going to take the entire Kingdom and as God has told David and promised to David I going to make that happen now I am going to take the entire Kingdom and give it to David because you could not keep your mouth shut concerning me in these false false accusations and this gentleman done the only wise thing that he could do he shut his mouth because now he realizes he's went too far and his kingdom is done and Abner sent Messengers to David on his behalf saying who is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all Israel unto thee so he sends Messengers to David says the rest of Israel is in my hand make your league with me and I will simply put the kingdom in your control skipping to verse 17 and Abner had communication with the elders of Israel saying ye sought for David in times past to be king over you now then do it for the Lord hath spoken of David saying by the hand of my servant David I will save my People Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies and Abner also spoke in the years of Benjamin and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David and Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin so Abner came to David David to Hein and 20 men with him and David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast and Abner said unto David I will arise and go and I will gather all Israel unto my Lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest Reign Over All That thy heart desireth and Abner and David sent abnar away and he went in peace and behold the Servants of David and joab came from pursu pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but Abner was not with David and heon for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace so just a little recap Abner comes presents his proposition to David David makes him a feast okay this is the way things are you recognize the promise that's over me go and do what you're going to do he sends them back towards Israel to rally the troops and bring things under his Dominion joab showed up on the scene now joab was out fighting a battle and he shows up and all the host that was with him were come and they told joab now remember joab is the captain of the host for David's Army for Judah and they told him Abner the son of Nur came to the king and he has sent him away and he is gone in peace then joab came came to the king and said what hast thou done behold Abner came unto thee why is it that thou Hast sent him away and he is quite gone thou knowest Abner the son of Nur that he came to deceive thee and to Know Thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest now joab has gone he's been fighting a battle he's missed the entire chain of events but yet he shows up with prophetic insight and absolute amazing discernment of what's going on but he's entirely wrong yeah he's been out doing what he was supposed to be doing for David but now he shows up and there's somebody who said that they're going to do something uh incredible and one man not joab but one man is going to deliver the entire Kingdom in today David's hand not joab another man and joab immediately immediately has such insight to the purpose and the reasonings that this man would be here doing this and he declares he does not ask a question this is not a question he shows up on the scene and immediately knows the answer this man was here to deceive you and he declares it as fact yeah when in fact it's a lie that's right true right he wasn't there for the meeting he wasn't there when ishbosheth accused Abner of laying with Saul's concubine and Abner said okay I'll show you yeah he wasn't there for any of this but yet how does he have this discernment of the int itions of this man and when joab was come out from David he sent Messengers after Abner which brought him again from The Well of SRA but David knew it not and when Abner was returned to Hein joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of AEL his brother so Abner we won't get into this right now but Abner had killed joab's brother back in the day in a fight and obviously he had never gotten over that even though David had tried to encourage him to and afterwards when David heard it he said I and my kingdom are Guiltless before the Lord forever from the blood of Abner the son of Nur let it rest on the head of joab and on all his father's house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leanth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lath bread that is not a good list but that is the list that follows the spirit of presuming remember what we are taught presuming is venturing without Authority joab has showed up and because joab doesn't want somebody else to do what he couldn't get done and he doesn't want somebody else to get the credit for doing something amazing and delivering the entire Kingdom into David's hand that was the goal was it not why was joab out fighting it was for David but now the somebody that shows up who can do something joab can't and joab has false discernment and joab presumes and he wants this to be true it doesn't matter at this point whether it's true or not this is what joab wants to be true so he sins and he fetches this guy back and he pulls him aside like he would talk to him as a brother and then he knifes him under the fifth rib and he kills against the wishes of David David did not order him to do this David did not suggest that he do this this is all joab venturing without Authority acting upon that see the this is the real danger of false discernment Saints it's a real danger to make yourself more spiritual than what you are it does not come without consequences yeah yeah amen he does this and it's not just bad enough that now that penalty and that blood is resting on him but now what he decided to do for his own sake and for his own position what he decided to do just for him now has negative consequences on everybody in his family from then on Let It rest on the house of joab and all his father's house and let there not fell from the house of job one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that lean crippled leanth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh bread brother Brandon said when lot went down to Sodom he did not consider the effects that that would have on on his children this is terrifying for a father I was okay until I had children and then I realized that I've got kids that I'm eternally responsible for right and now I can't just make a mistake and it be okay and sweep it under the rug I can't deviate here and it' be okay and you just sweep it under the rug I can't make excuses anymore for not lining up to the word of God because it used to be maybe I would just know about or maybe my wife would just know about it but now I've got to fool four little children about it and now I'm preaching to my children that they have to give preeminence to the word and that they have to be yielded to the spirit of God but yet they can see in my life where I'm not lot did not consider the effects it would have on his children when he for himself chose Sodom right okay lot is you Sodom is compromised against the word just in case you're having a hard time following the type when we I said you lot is us when we consider what we want and what is good and best for us irregardless of what the word of God says yeah you are not just affecting yourself you're going to affect your children you're going to affect the local body you're going to affect the coworker you might have had a chance to witness to at work the list goes on and on and on for Generations this is the danger of presuming and just taking what we want doing what we think is best and the King said unto his servants know this is verse 38 know ye not that there is a prince and a great man Fallen This Day in Israel he's referring back to Abner who joab just killed and I am this day weak though anointed king and these men the son of the sons of zarua be too hard for me the Lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness so now here's King David who was a warrior who had fought Lord only knows how many battles at this point had slain however many people but now David comes and says these sons joab and his brother they're too hard for even me I can't sanction this this is too much for me and he's he's telling his people don't you understand what Abner was trying to do don't you understand that is a great man Abner was was acting in the place of a great man to do something great and he is dead don't you all understand that this is not a time to be happy skipping to 2 Samuel 19 second Samuel 19 verse 9 and all the people were at Strife throughout all the tribes of Israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absum and absum whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back so this is again after the Insurrection of Absalon David was Outcast then Absalon was killed in battle and all Israel is saying why have we not considered bringing King David back why are we so LAX in this verse 11 and King David sent to zadok and to abur the priest saying Speak unto the Elders of Judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king even to his house ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king and say ye to amasa Art Thou not of my bone and of My Flesh God do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the of the host before me continually in the room of joab meaning instead of joab and he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants so amasa was I don't know if he was maybe Deputy Chief of Staff to Abner but he was directly with or beside Abner Abner got taken off the scene by joab there's another War there's another Insurrection and now David is recognizing they're without a king and he's questioning them what's going on why can we not reconcile why has this not been brought forth and now he speaks to the new captain of the host amasa and he tells him basically if you'll forgive me for inserting it basically do what Abner had agreed to do and I will make you captain of the host and that will never cease you will be captain of the host continually before me Abner it says AB uh not Abner amasa bowed the heart of all the men of Judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return and all thy servants so this one man was able to do exactly what uh Abner said that he was going to do and he rallies the kingdom and positionally places them under David short time goes p 2 Samuel 20:1 and there happened to be there a man of bile as this is all going on and there happened to be there a man of bile whose name was she the son of betra a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in David neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse every man to his tents all Israel skipping to verse four then said the king to amasa so amasa is now captain of the host and there's an Insurrection going on David says to amasa assemble me the men of Judah within 3 days and be thou here present so amasa went to assemble the men of Judah but he carried longer than the set time which had been appointed him and David said to abash now shall Sheba the son of VRA do us more harm than did Absalom take thou thy Lord's servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and Escape Us in other words Sheba is causing this Insurrection amas is taking too long to get it to get it done go take care of this for me and there went out after him joab's men and the I'm not going to try to pronounce that another group of people and another group of people and the Mighty Men and they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba verse 8 when they were at the great Stone which is in gibian a Masa went before them and joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him so not only did he get joab's position he got joab's clothing and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins and the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out and joab had now caught up to amasa and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him but amasa took no heat to the sword that was in joab's hand so he smokee him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and Abisha his brother pursued after Sheba the son of bitra this was nowhere in joab's orders nowhere in joab's orders did David tell him go take care of Sheba and oh by the way when you catch up to amasa I understand he's been dilator he hasn't met the timeline when you catch up to him just go ahead and kill my new captain of the host who I swore would be before me continually this was nowhere in the orders the was no even you know wink wink nod nod nothing he tells him go take care help him take care of this because if this continues to go on it's going to be worse than the Insurrection with absil so joab goes in as backup and his first role as backup is to knife the new new captain of the host that's right you know why cuz joab never repented for killing Abner right he's still running a red horse oh yeah he hasn't recognized the problem yeah this poor guy amasa had no idea what he was getting himself into if he would have had any sense about him when David said I'll make you the new captain of the host he'd have been like no thanks I like my fifth rib yeah I like it where it's at I like my intestines where they're at yeah it says joab hit him and struck him so fiercely that it disembed him and he never had to touch him again this was not an accidental slippage of the knife this was not leaning in to kiss him and oh whoops sorry this was intent to destroy this man who has taken my position from the minute he heard the word go yeah oh yeah no orders from the King no suggestion from the King only this is what Jo needs to do for joab acted like he was going to kiss the man yeah where have we heard that before acted like he was going to kiss the man and knifed him and one of joab's men stood by and said he that fath joab and he that is for David let him go after joab I'll agree with the first part of that he that fath joab go after joab but now one of joab's servants is rallying the troops under the name of David to follow joab as in okay David would sanction this it'd be okay who's following joab let's go to battle this Spirit had not only overtaken joab but now it's infiltrated the men under joab that now they don't even have a problem with this that's right no King's orders no King's suggestion no desire of the king an ex captain of the host could come for backup to the battle kill the current captain of the host who the king himself has declared I want to be the captain of the host he has just rendered the entire Kingdom into my hand he would come to him kill him and now his men don't say what' you do that for did David tell you to do that and we didn't hear no they immediately said whoever's for joab and whoever's for David let's go that might have been for joab but that wasn't for David right here's the Striking part of this whole topic and inspiration for me we've seen people and examples who wanted to be king they would kill the other king like they would have battles I want to own this territory you're in my way I need to be king over this territory we go to battle we fight it out joab I find nowhere in the scripture joab had any desire to be a king joab did not want to be number one but joab was not about to settle for anything but number two this is so striking for me you have an individual and a spirit working who will recognize I'm not going to be number one I'm not going to be first we can use the word King if we want but you understand what I'm saying I'm not going to be the best I'm not going to be recognized as the leader as number one as in charge but now I have this position and he earned his position fair and square joab did right in the beginning he earned his position fair and square there was a battle to be fought and David said whoever takes this I'll make you captain of the host and he earned it fair and square but now he's got this position and he's recognized David as king and he says that's fine you can be king I don't want to be king how easy it would have been for him to kill David no desire no no desire to do that though opportunity after opportunity after opportunity he's in close proximity to him all the time he never touches number one but but any perceived it don't even have to be a legitimate threat any perceived threat to spot number two your fifth ribs in trouble you're done see this is the point that I want to get at Saints is we can preach all day long you don't have to be the best you don't have to be number one you don't have to be in charge but that's still not even the real issue because if you get over that and you still think that you should be number two it's the same Spirit if there's 400 people and you think you should be 399 right we still wrong God right you see that's not big of a deal I mean there is 400 and I'm probably better than two of them in thine heart yeah that's right amen thy was lifted up in thy heart thy said you may factually be number four legitimately factually whatever example you want it to be you are the fourth best but if in your heart you think you're fourth best yeah right you still have the spirit of joab yeah in thine heart is the problem the issue is not whether we're fighting for first spot or second spot third spot whatever down the line that's the number is not the issue the issue is if we're fighting for any spot that's right yes sir now I'm using really generic terminology here but you can put this to whatever example you want yes and it'll work it'll apply we may not be the best message church but we're definitely in the top five all right let's just be real I don't want to be the pastor here but I'm sure going to be the better than all the other ministers I don't I understand I am not the most spiritual in the church but I'm at least in the top 10 start saying amen or I'll get really real I mean I'll start giving job descriptions at everything I may not be the best at cutting hair but I'm not the last where's my welders I might not be the best welder at the tank shop but I know def no there can't be more than four that's better than me and that's only because they've had 20 like years of experience if I had 20 years of experience I'd be in the top two you say well that don't happen oh it happens Saints it happens you know what's the astounding part of that we may not be the best message church but we're in the top five you can still be serving God's purpose you can still be doing the work of God you can still be preaching the word you can still be getting Souls saved you can still be having Deliverance you can still be accomplishing things joab was accomplishing stuff in between this whole Gap joab was still a part of the program and joab is accomplishing stuff he is overtaking cities he is destroying the Philistines that's right but in his heart that's right yeah yeah he's all messed up that's right true so just because we would have that mindset doesn't mean that all of the manifestations and all the workings and everything's just going to dissipate right we can still be doing there may be facts to support why we're top three right it's not like you just have this thought and now God says oh you had that thought boom you're out of the program you're gone you're done no joab continued working under King David right this continued manifestations were happening what was the other example I got oh I don't want to be the pastor here but I want to be the best backup to the pastor and factually speaking maybe it's so I'm not saying it is I'm just saying hypothetically what if it was so it's not not like if I have that thought remember gifts and callings are without repentance right God's not just going to snatch that gift out of there and it can't work anymore period no he may continue to use that and things may be getting accomplished that's right that's why brother bandam says that a man can take a Divine gift and send himself to hell with it that's right and souls would be saved under that Ministry being part of the program is not safe just because joab can go out to battle and say oh it's still working there's another city for King David it's still working I'm still captain of the host clearly anointed didn't mean that he was okay right right right so those examples that we gave the fact pattern can support those it can absolutely be legit but that's not the problem the facts aren't the problem thine heart our heart is what we have to examine like I said this is the astounding part of this when I really started digging into this is why didn't joab just make himself King he don't have to worry about somebody else taking his position as captain of the host in he can be king and captain of the the host if he wants to be why doesn't he just go for all of it but because of the way joab was made maybe he didn't like the politics of it maybe he just liked killing people maybe he just likeed to do batt I don't have time for all that King stuff you do the king stuff I'll kill everybody I don't know it's but we understand I say that kind of jokingly but we understand people are just wired differently like there's you could make me the president of artificial intelligence and I would be like no thanks you could be number one not interested no clue you understand what I'm saying there's things just within ourselves we have no interest in that but now okay you can be president you can be president of the entire nation no thanks no thanks I'm not wired that way that wouldn't fit me so there is people that don't want to be number one but for whatever reason they have to be number two whatever position that number two is understand it's not just a number two it's a position now if there was a position underneath the presidency of somebody who would specialize in removing dangerous wildlife from the citizens of this country also known as wh tail deer and turkeys and rabbits now now maybe we've got something worth fighting for but I don't have time for the other stuff not interested and I'm I don't know how joab was wired I don't know why he didn't just knife David under the fifth rib and become king but there is clearly this Spirit at work of an individual and a spirit who will not try to totally overthrow everything not totally it won't try to totally overthrow everything but anything that would threaten its position is not going to survive that's right this is a mystery to me I'm not saying I have the answer for this I I don't know how this works I don't know why I don't know how that is right but it is right and it's in the church that's right I'm not saying this church I'm saying it's in the spiritual realm it's in the church Realm you will have an individual who's not even called to a Ministry wreck havoc for the local assembly for a local assembly because he needs to be viewed in a certain spiritual position that's right he doesn't want to you understand what I'm saying you can have somebody who's not even called to be a song leader they're a musician but they will try to control the song service by their instrument they don't want to be the song leader but they want to control the worship service you can have a deacon doesn't want to be the pastor maybe not even qualified to be the pastor he doesn't even want to be the head Deacon but he wants to be known as the second most spiritual Deacon on the board well I might as well continue you can have trustees they he doesn't even want to be the second most reliable trustee but he is the third most reliable trustee if it can't get done the first time or the second time I'm your guy we can handle it the third time around that's what I'm known for don't try to threaten my position we laugh cuz this is comical but the spirit is real the spirit is real and the spirit will manifest itself I have got to keep moving my goodness First Kings 1 verse1 now King David was old and stricken in years and they covered him with cloths but he got no heat skipping to verse 5 then adah I'm going to have to just paraphrase some of this you all know this story anyhow okay so David's going to die they adah decides my father's dying now is a good time to exalt myself and make myself King we obviously know Solomon was supposed to be king but it says in verse 7 and he conferred not speaking of aiah and he conferred with joab the son of zarua and with abathar the priest and they following Adan Adan I'm sorry adania helped him I know I'm saying it right but I can't get it I'm saying it wrong but I can't get it right now sorry but and they helped him but zad the priest and beniah the son of JEA and Nathan the prophet and shemiah and Rah and the Mighty Men which belonged to David were not with adenah so it gives the list of people that he conferred with to overthrow David and it gives the list of people he did not confer with wonder why that's right and basba bowed this is verse 16 and did Obi Ence unto the king and the King said what wouldest thou so we know Nathan the prophet discerned the situation came to Beth Sheba said hey do you recognize what adanah is doing she says didn't have a clue but I know Solomon's supposed to be king Nathan says you go talk to the king while you're talking to the king I'll come in I'll confirm your word and we'll get this straightened out and she said unto him my Lord thou swearest by the Lord thy God unto thy handm saying surely Solomon thy son will reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne and now behold Adan adania reth and now my Lord the king thou knowest it not and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but Solomon thy servant hath he not called so now joab recognizes something David's going to die right David's the one that gave me my position after I killed the other guy that he gave this position to but when David goes off the scene there's going to be a new king and this son of his is declaring that he's the new king and now he's came and he's conferred with me will you help me in my plan joab has spent his entire life right beside David could have killed him at any time and became king and he didn't but he recognizes David is about to die and he recognizes what his position is in Jeopardy again because who knows what will happen and who knows what a new king would do and we certainly just can't trust God to let this figure itself out and work its way out he says verse 20 uh Beth Sheba is still speaking and thou my Lord oh King the eyes of all is are upon thee that thou should us tell them who shall sit on the throne of my Lord the King after him otherwise it shall come to pass when my Lord thy King shall sleep with his fathers that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders and lo while she was yet talking with the King Nathan the prophet walks in as I just said he confirms everything ba Sheeba said uh let's skip on down 27 is this thing done by my Lord the king and thou Hast not not showed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my Lord the King after him then King David answered and said call me Beth Sheeba and she came into the king's presence and stood before the king and the King swear and said as the Lord liveth thou Hast redeemed my soul out of all distress even as I swear unto thee by the Lord God of Israel saying assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon th throne in my stud even so will I certainly do it this day then Beth Sheeba bowed her face to the Earth and did reverence to the king and said let my Lord King David live forever and King David said call me zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and beniah the son of JEA and they came before the king there was a list of people that add somebody say that name for me so I can say that ad say it again ad ad I'm sorry I just can't do it I'm going to call him Mr a cuz I can't say sorry I just can't the bad guy there was a list the bad guy did not want at this meeting that's right true but it's the same list that David wanted at his meeting call these people to me the king also said unto him take with you the Servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule and bring him down to guihan and let zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there King over Israel and blow ye the trumpet and say God save King Solomon then ye shall come up after him that may that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah and beniah the son of JEA answered the king and said said amen the Lord God of my Lord the king say so too and the Lord hath been with my Lord the king I'm sorry as the Lord hath been with my Lord the king even so be he with Solomon and listen to this statement and make his throne greater than the Throne of my Lord King David what a statement I just brought you into my counsil as a trusted advisor and as one that I could trust to carry out this plan that I wanted and your thanks to me is yes let's do that and I hope his Kingdom's better than yours joab would have never said that right joab would have said yes let all of that be done and by the way can you make sure that I stay captain of The Host but now bayah says yes amen I agree let's do that and let his kingdom and as God has been with you let him be greater and better why because this is what David wanted all along that's right this was David's heart's desire that's right what sounds like an insult is actually Beni tapping into the back part of David's mind and recognizing oh this is what he's going to do that's right yeah amen this is his son Solomon from his wife be Sheba and he's loved him so much I wonder what he would want done I wonder what how he would want Solomon's kingdom to progress I wonder how he would want things carried out see there's nothing in here about I wonder what my position is going to be he's already been given his position go and do this amen let's do it and I hope it's greater than anything you've ever done why does he have this mindset it's because he wasn't running around with the mindset of protecting bayah there is a scripture sidebar here but there is a scripture Isaiah 4031 I believe that says that we will raise up with wings as Eagles we will raise up the we will renew our strength and raise up with wings like eagles we will renew our strength and raise up I wonder if this is not not so much him sprinkling fairy fairy dust over us and saying now you're magically you have renewed strength and wings like eagles I wonder if us renewing our strength is simply just us not using our strength and letting him use his strength through us to do what he wants to do right rather than us constantly using our strength to the point of exhaustion trying to accomplish what we want done maybe it's and I I don't want to take any Supernatural away from that scripture but maybe it's not as Supernatural as what we think maybe us renewing our strength and being able to rise up like with wings like eagles we've already got Eagles Wings the old and the New Testament what is our problem that's holding us down and wearing out our strength is when we're not using his wings to raise up a a little higher and do what he wants but we're constantly clutching to something on the ground trying to tug on it because this is what I want if we would just let go of what we want right we wouldn't get so tired because we're not doing anything yeah and now by default our strength would come back to us see this is what bayah grab to hold of this is why beniah could see the purpose and the intent of what David wanted and why he would make it what seems like an insulting statement to David but it's exactly in line with what David would have wished right so zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and beniah the son of JEA and the cherethites and the pites went down and caused Solomon to ride up on King David's mule and brought him to guon gyon and Z zadok the priest took an Horn of oil out of the Tabernacle and anointed Solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said God saved King Solomon now that this is 2 Kings 2:1 now the days of David Drew nigh that he should die and he charged Solomon his son saying I go the way of the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his Commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of Moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whether soest whether soever thou turnest thyself that the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying If thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul th shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of Israel verse 5 moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of Zera did to me and what he did to the two captains of the host of Israel Abner and amasa and oh I'm sorry it just says that and unto Abner and unto amasa the son of Jeth whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of War upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on on his feet do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his whhe head go down to the grave in peace this is joab captain of the host who served with David I don't know for how many years how many decades that's right fought side by side with him did his bidding did did his command this is his end result that's right yeah David speaking to the new King Solomon he doesn't say remember joab and all that he has done for the Kingdom of Israel he says remember joab and what he did to me in other words properly discern joab properly discern joab's heart yeah and deal with him according to wisdom but show kindness unto the son of Sons of barzilla the gileadite gileadite and let them of those that eat at thy table and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when I fled because of absum thy brother and behold thou Hast with thee shimi the son of I'm not going to go through this entire list David starts naming names he says remember joab remember Shima and deal with them accordingly David passes off the scene let's skip down to 14 so he said says now let's skip to 15 this is Mr a the bad guy whose name I can't say and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel set their faces before me and that I should Reign How be it the kingdom is turned about and has become my brothers for it was him his from the Lord and now I he's speaking to Beth Sheeba and now I ask one Petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on and he said speak I pray thee un to Solomon the king for he will not say to thee nay that he give me abishag the shunamite to wife and B Sheba said well I will speak to the king I will speak for thee unto the king so we know the story now basba comes to King Solomon she says this is what your brother has requested and he properly discerns it and he says um should I also give him the entire Kingdom and he says this is so interesting to me in verse 22 he says should we also ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abathar the priest and for joab the son of zarua the priest and joab had nothing to do with this but this is proper discernment this is not presuming this is proper discernment and now he says and he recognizes if this is what he's asking and this is what he wants me to do this would be equivalent to them accomplishing the Insurrection that they set out to do to begin with that's guess who gets added to the list Mr a now therefore as the Lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of David my father and who hath made me and house and H has promised ananiah shall be put to death this day and King Solomon set sent by the hand of Bah the son of JEA and he fell upon him that he died now stay with me we're going to close in just a second when we go through this and unto abathar the priest said the king get thee to anoth unto thine own fields for Thou Art Worthy of death but I will not this time put thee to death because thou bearest the Ark of the Lord God before David my father because thou Hast been Afflicted and all wherein my father was afflicted so Solomon Thrust out abathar from being priest unto the Lord that he might fulfill the word of the Lord which he spake concerning the house of Eli and Shiloh then Tidings came to joab in other words joab hears what's going down for joab had turned after adanah though he turned not after absolum and joab fled unto the Tabernacle of the Lord and caught hold on the horns of the Altar and it was told King Solomon that joab was fled into the Tabernacle of the Lord and behold he is by the altar then Solomon sent bah the son of JEA saying go and fall upon him and bah came to the tabernac Tabernacle of the Lord and said said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but I will die here and beniah brought the king word again saying thus saith joab and thus he answered me and the King said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab Shed from me and from the house of my father and the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my Father David not knowing thereof to wit Abner the son of Nur captain of the host of Israel and amasa the son of Jeth captain of the host of Judah their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed forever but upon David and upon his seat and upon his house and upon his th Throne shall there be peace forever from the Lord so beniah the son of JEA went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness and the king put beniah the son of JEA in his room over the host beniah was made captain of the host my question to you is this what did benayah do to ensure beniah became captain of the host even when he was given orders to go and kill joab he recognizes the law of God this man has got a hold of the horns of the Temple he goes back he goes back to the king and says are you sure right I don't want to get into all the laws and regulations surrounding that but solom was totally justified in doing what he did where he did it but bayah did not run in there and say you know what it's finally my turn it's finally my turn I've longed for this day when he's out of the picture I know what's going to happen I am finally going to get what I deserve I am finally going to be in second place no bayah has this opportunity presented before him and he has direct orders from the King kill him and he runs back to the king and says are you sure right I don't want to do anything to displease the king I just want to update you about what the current situation is make sure that you got a real understanding of what we're doing here I don't have a problem doing it you just tell me to do it but are you sure God Solomon is looking at him no doubt thinking you realize you're going to be captain of The Host after you do this no Solomon don't even have that thought bah did not have to do anything to eventually end up in the proper position he should have been in to begin with nothing all he had to do was do what bayah was told to do yeah God and stay in the position bayah was in that's right and whenever it was time for to be upgraded and promoted and put into second place nobody was going to stop that amise God and it was done immediately he never had to shed Ence of blood he never never had to defy the king he never had to break the law of God and he certainly didn't have to lay around waiting for somebody that had been a blessing to him his entire life and the minute he saw weakness in him jump into a plan to kill him how repulsive David had did everything for joab joab won one battle and he won at fair and square and made himself captain of the host that was his legitimate reward but David did everything else for joab David was even the one that gave the proposition so David so joab could get in that position that's right and now joab as a thank you sat around and waited till his friend the King was going to die and instead of being a buddy when he really needed the buddy when he was down and out and weak and on his way out okay bring it up to date Saints when you had really made a mistake when somebody had really made a mistake when your brother your sister your pastor your Deacon your trustee your song leader yes your family member when they had really made a mistake when they were on the brink of death the point of no return they can't come back from that I don't want to be associated with that right when they really needed a bu when they really needed somebody to encourage them right how repulsive he turns his back on him and joins a scheme to R the kingdom away from him joab had spent his entire life trying to get the kingdom into David's hands and now when he thinks David is weak and on his way out instead of going over and been like hey but love you but we both know 's are coming what are we going to do what's your plan what can I do to help you to fulfill your plan that conversation never took place the only conversation that took place was joab sitting around talking to joab trying to figure out how joab could protect joab's position and if that means sacrifice the Gody that's been a blessing to me for decades yeah he should have known better but I'm certainly not going to spoil my skirts around that certainly not going to be part of a exiting party I still got to be number two right that spirit is not dead [Music] Saints and that spirit because of the opening of the word can be more properly discerned much quicker when it starts operating I find it astounding of how quickly we will turn our backs on a man that falls when he has Faithfully tried to do the best that he can and I'm not I don't have any specific examples like don't wait for me to like there's no surprise here I'm talking principles I don't have a specific example I'm not if there's something going on I don't know what's going on and just don't even bother telling me here there or Yonder wherever I I have no clue of any examples I'm talking principles right now but I've had conversations with individuals over a a brother that has done something wrong and that entire conversation is how he he's done there's no hope for him I saw this coming I saw it coming he wouldn't listen to me nothing in that conversation about we got to pray for this guy he's really struggling right now no doubt this is hard on him you know he probably needs some encouragement right now none of that why is it always directly to keep keep digging his hole how many holes has God rescued us out of why can't we help dig him out of his hole rather than dig his hole deeper or her hole deeper because maybe by per chance if we get seen if somebody sees us talking to that brother or sister and encouraging them well those they'll lump us into his group you know that's the guy that just fell that's the guy that just really messed up and I seen so and so with him that spirit's not dead bayah didn't have to do anything for bah praise God all bah had to do was keep fighting the enemy and not fight his Brethren and even when he had direct orders from the King to fight his brother go back and check and make sure I got clarification here that's right right constantly constantly putting others before himself we're going to skip through the rest of this we know that the rest of the bad guys on the list Solomon says bah please go take care of them bah please go take care of this and bah please go take care of shimi at the end of that 46 so the king commanded bayah the son of JEA which went out and fell upon him and he died this was shimi the of verse 46 and the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon the kingdom was not established in the hand of Solomon until bayah got done with what bah needed to do benah was the direct manifestation of what King David wanted done to Solomon and Solomon did not have everything in his power and his authority and properly set up the way way things needed to be until bah got done doing what bah needed to do I would dare to say that bah was instrumental in accomplishing what David wanted done with Solomon he had to be there and bah in all of these tasks wasn't running around trying to ensure that benah gets to stay captain of The Host after he takes this next one out or while I'm out taking care of what King Solomon's wanting me to do is there a threat to somebody else doing something better than me and getting a promotion to captain of the host there was none of that going on the definition of bayah in the Hebrew is God has built God has built not man has built benayah means God has done this amen saints of God as the musicians come I'm just going to have to close because if I keep going we're going to be here all night I do not want to be part of something man has built not position not program not not church not even manifestations nothing carnal nothing spiritual if man has built it I don't want any part of it I don't even care what position I would have in it maybe I'm number one maybe I'm number two maybe I'm number three if man has built it I'm out I don't want anything to do with it but if God is is doing it if God has built it I would count it a privilege to be number 400 out of 400 am amise God and you know what's really really powerful about position 400 is if God has put me in position 400 yes I I will never be position 401 and I don't have to worry about what number 401 is doing better than me I don't have to worry if number 401 is more spiritual than me I don't have to worry if number 401 has a better Ministry than me he'll never be 400 because God made 400 so now you're Ang anxiety can just go away your depression can just go away that's right and you can just rest in the fact knowing I am number 400 amen and God has made me number 400 yes and I just thank God I'm part of the number and if God has made you part of the number nobody can take you out of the number so now if I see number one or let's move on down to the list if I see number 15 making a mistake falling out of the way not being as spiritual as he should or really just being a bad guy I don't have a problem going to him and trying to encourage him to get back into position number 15 because as a result of that I'm never going to be more than 400 if he falls out of number 15 God will put somebody else in 15 but it's not me I'm 400 I know my position so why don't I try to keep number 15 in his position and if he by chance falls out let's let's prop him back up let's pray for him let's encourage him let's bring back to his memory You're Number 15 I'm using numbers but you can put positions in there whatever whatever example you want to put in there you get the principal amen amen if God has built it it's going to be sure and if God has built it we don't need to circumvent anything prise God if God has built it let's rest in what God has [Music] built this Spirit was on Gaza Gaza was Elisha's servant walked with him talked with him slept with him ate with him saw all the Miracles you want to know what the end of Gesa was for two two pieces of silver they were big pieces but they were still just two pieces of silver the king of Syria comes to him Elisha heals him tells him to go dip gets heals of healed of his leprosy he says I will serve no other God but your lord now and he's all these presents for you for healing me Elisha says God did it not me keep your presence have a merry day haa yeah says what are you doing the king of Syria leaves he chases him down right and says my Lord just had some visitors and they could really use a couple of the things you have total lie by the way right the man says well don't just take that take this too he runs it back hides it in his house walks in Elisha says Gesa where have you been this is so astounding to me but this is a direct result of putting self in front of God that's right you become spiritually blind yeah Gaza had walked with Elisha for how many years he knew Elisha knew the secrets of everything and he asks him where he's been and he says I didn't go anywhere it's in astounding statement but I wonder if we've ever told God that when God has come by his word and says Where Have You Been yes and what have you been doing oh Lord I I I I wasn't trying to protect myself I didn't go anywhere I didn't do anything for me like he don't know your heart I didn't say it that way so that that person would think I was more spiritual I didn't Where Have You Been that's right what have you been doing right you keep protecting yourself and you keep looking out for self this is the result you eventually be looking into the face of the Prophet saying I didn't go anywhere and he already knows where you've been and what you did and now a curse comes the leprosy that was on the king of Syria you have it now get out of my presence this is the line brother brandham said a man could cross but you don't just get there overnight it's a process let's stand I've got to stop it's a process and the process begins with protecting self the process begins with Building self up the process begins with tearing somebody else down so that you can stay built up that's right I might not have to look the best but if I make them look worse than me then I would at least be better than them that's right whatever example whatever application you want to put it in the principle is still the same right I got to stop I don't want to be joab I think we can all agree please start playing something that things are going to get busier things are going to get faster things are going to get more difficult to [Music] discern and we are probably going to be more prone to mess it up when it does the chances of messing things up are getting greater and faster and more likely unless I'm just living in a world all to myself like there is some confusing stuff going on that's right and again I'm not talking anything specific I have no specific examples I'm just preaching principles but can we all agree with this it's faster it's difficult the decisions the it's overwhelming I don't want to be guilty of hatching up a plan to overthrow my brother or my sister to keep myself looking spiritual just because they messed up when things were tough and I don't even want to take the attitude with they should have known better they were taught better they had better examples all of that's true but how many times did you have all of that and still messed it up how many times did I have all of that and still messed it up and you know what he didn't leave me he didn't leave you and he's our example that's right I don't want to take a joab spirit and be part of a plan hatched up to kick him while he's down or to kick her while she's down even if it cost me my reputation and it cost me a demotion I want to go to my brother or go to my sister and try to pick him up and prop them up and say long live the king right I don't want to be part of a joab plan sir amen but I want to be fully engaged in a benah plan am what God is doing what God is building amen that's what I want to be a part of let's pray together precious Lord Jesus just pray you take these broken words these many mispronounced words father and I pray that you would just let me have Grace in the eyes of the people and they would Overlook that but they would catch the principle that's being presented Lord father we are so grateful that we have had examples throughout the scriptures and we have had an example in our age of a man who would not try to promotee himself and not try to make himself something but through trial and error and through getting things wrong would come and humble himself and repent and tell us how to to do things properly Lord we thank you for that example I pray that we would take that principle that we would fully embrace it and that would we would make it a principle to live by because this is what you represented Lord you are the one who came and made yourself of no reputation to help those who really had no reputation who were Unworthy of a reputation you forfeited everything just to be in the plan of what God what the father had originally created you to do you were the one who said not my will but thine be done father may we take that attitude in every aspect of our life both spiritually and carnally may we never be guilty of trying to build our own Pro program or our own agenda or our own reputation but may we be happy and content and satisfied in what you have made us to be we commit ourselves to you we commit this evening to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you let's sing brother Chad if you'd please come my heart oh God make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you change my heart change my heart oh God [Music] make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you you are the Potter you are the part I am the CL mold me and make me this is what I pray change my heart oh God [Music] make it ever true change my heart oh God may I be like you amen I tell you that was an absolutely profound principle and I feel like our brother only had time to scratch just barely scratch the surface and I for one ask God to flesh it out more and more for us cuz there's so much there amen there is so much contrasting the life of joab and bayah but I know who I walked away wanting to be like I don't know about you but I wanted to be a bayah to my God I want to be a faithful servant who wants to please him and do what he says for him amen not for me me there was there was a couple things that that he said that just really struck me and I want to highlight them as we go he said when he talked about Lucifer said thine heart was lifted up that's the problem that was the problem everything else that followed was the result the problem was his heart was lifted up say God help us please help us and then when when he says uh the scripture out of Isaiah they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle I thought that whole explanation was wonderful that what's the precursor they that wait upon the Lord not to go and figure something out and make something happen just wait on the Lord when the Lord gives Direction then it'll work amen because now we don't go in our own mind bah was there all along friends bayah was one of those that was one of the mighty men with David when he was running cave to Cave before he was King he was there the whole time but I think my just my personal opinion I think the whole time he was only doing what David told him to do and he was content and happy doing what David told him to do but when you wait upon the Lord and his Lord was David amen amen then the one scripture that came to my mind that just really wrapped everything up for me was if you will save your life you will lose it but if you will lose your life for my sake you shall find it right and we saw that example man and joab unfortunately so God help us to get rid of self I don't know how to do it in our own power I don't know how to do it in my own strength but oh if we could ever get rid of self so that we don't need to protect self promote self uh uh uh provide for self or preserve self if we could just get rid of self everything would be all right and we could just put God first in every way I'm I'm leaving here amen with a desire in my heart to be a bayah to my Lord and let whatever God wants to do let I want to be one who God builds not where I built myself oh what a good lesson I just pray that God will let that go deeper this is extremely deep friends amen there was so many things firing off inside of me I wish brother Ben had all night am because I want this to go deep into my heart and change me forever amen let's just bow our heads together and thank the Lord for his word Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your word and God we're so thankful that you brought one of your servants into this position that you could speak through his lips Lord for we recognize it's beyond our brother this was something you wanted to speak to us Lord God this is something you wanted to draw our attention to so we could have eyes to see so that we can be guarded against self so we can be guarded against pride and the things that plague human beings Lord they don't just plague human beings they plague us but God we've seen Lord through the word that you've delivered tonight God that that's not your plan for us we don't need to promote ourselves we don't need to preserve ourselves we don't need to provide for ourselves or to protect ourselves all we need to do is stay faithful to you you've got everything under control help us Lord to leave here God with that bayah attitude God I thank you for what you've done for us tonight I pray that it would have impact on our lives and go deep and root out all of selfishness and pride and may we be a different kind of servant to you because you are our King we just want to be a faithful manah to you whether you're in a king in a cave or on a throne wherever you are I want to be right behind you supporting you Lord doing what you would have me to do whether it's in the shadows or in the Limelight Lord I I want to be like bah where it doesn't matter Lord to me what matters is Lord your word is my command your will is my desire your desire is my command and my will God help us to take that attitude put it in US Let it Grow from within the seed that's in US Lord for the preaching of the word will produce results let this preaching produce that result in me tonight it's my desire Lord we ask that you'd bless our brother Benjamin we're thankful for him for his honesty and transparency and his willingness to surrender himself to you I pray that you refresh him and restore him to him and continually feed him and equip him so that he can feed your children and bless all of us Lord may we walk out of here different than we walked in we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you all the like create in me a clean heart [Music] oh God and renew the right Spirit within [Music] me create in me a green heart oh God and renew a right spir Within Me cast me not oh and cast me not not away from thy [Applause]
