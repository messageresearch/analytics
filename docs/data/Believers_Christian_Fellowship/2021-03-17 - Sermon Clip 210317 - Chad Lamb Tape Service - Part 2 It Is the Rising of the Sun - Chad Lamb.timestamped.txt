[0:00] watch it was the spiritual revealed word
[0:04] that did it that's the reason
[0:07] he told them to go baptized in the name
[0:09] of father son holy ghost
[0:10] he knowed they knowed who he was
[0:14] look how brother benham tied this thing
[0:15] together he's saying now
[0:17] now he got a right sharp balling out
[0:19] from a woman because of what he had said
[0:21] but brother bannon prefaced what he said
[0:22] was this is
[0:23] only to my people only to those that are
[0:26] staying with this word and on this word
[0:30] the ones who are believing the
[0:31] manifested revealed word for the day the
[0:33] ones who have accepted christ amen
[0:35] the ones who have got who have accepted
[0:38] amen the word made flesh
[0:39] he said it's only for those people so
[0:41] brother brethren preface that
[0:43] he comes down and he says now he told
[0:45] peter whatever you bind i'll buy what
[0:47] you loose i'll lose
[0:48] amen that's the divine revelation of the
[0:50] word made flesh
[0:52] and he goes on to say whosoever sends
[0:54] your remit to them to remit whoever
[0:56] sends you retain to them to retain
[0:58] and he says not like the catholics where
[1:00] the catholic priest says you're forgiven
[1:01] and you're not and you confess it to me
[1:03] no he says watch it's the spiritual
[1:06] revealed word that did it that's
[1:07] why he told them to baptize that way
[1:11] what he's showing
[1:15] that the revelation of who the father
[1:18] son and holy ghost was
[1:19] he told him to baptize that way because
[1:21] he knew that they caught the revelation
[1:23] of who he was and would come preaching
[1:25] the right baptism
[1:26] and when the right baptism would only be
[1:28] accepted by the eagles and when it was
[1:30] accepted by the eagles
[1:31] when they accepted the word for their
[1:33] day their sins would be remitted
[1:36] it wasn't a hocus pocus or casting a
[1:39] spell
[1:40] or an incantation or you said this and i
[1:42] say this and you're forgiven because of
[1:44] this
[1:44] no they just gave the revelation of the
[1:46] word for their day
[1:47] what must we do to be saved repent amen
[1:50] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:51] jesus and you shall receive the gift of
[1:53] the holy ghost and they accepted it they
[1:54] believed it and then they repented they
[1:56] were baptized and they were filled with
[1:57] the holy ghost and their sins were
[1:59] remembered
[2:01] that's how the apostles remitted sin
[2:04] by giving the revealed word for their
[2:06] day and when it was accepted and acted
[2:09] upon the sins were remitted
[2:11] how is the sins remitted in this day the
[2:14] exact same way it's no different
[2:16] the revealed word of the hour is given
[2:18] out amen it's accepted by faith and
[2:20] acted upon
[2:21] amen and the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:23] comes and the sin is washed away
