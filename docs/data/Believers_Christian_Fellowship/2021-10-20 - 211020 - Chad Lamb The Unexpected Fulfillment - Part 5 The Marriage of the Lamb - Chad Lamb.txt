jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you all while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to second corinthians chapter 11. and i just want to give you an update we were able to go over to brother levi yoder and his family's place over in stark county just north of holmes county on sunday evening and had a service there we had a really really wonderful time it was really a nice home meeting and we thank god for his presence and for the word and levi's brother ben and his whole family was there so it was good to have them there and join us and god's doing a work amongst them all so we thank you for your prayers thank you to those who are able to travel out and support the services there and we just had a wonderful time and so i just want to give you an update on that also uh i heard a report i got a report that brother jason demars is starting to improve amen so thank you for your prayers he's beginning to show signs of improvement they're just beginning to wean him off of the auction and so far he's responding well to that so they're hoping if things go well in another day or two they may be able to get him out of icu into a regular room so just continue to hold the brother up in prayer that god will give him a full restoration amen praise god amen let's take and look at second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2. for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begot eve through the through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ amen you can have your seats we ask the lord that his blessing to the reading of his word this evening amen i appreciate your song sister jackie it was really special it's quite a sacrifice for sister jackie to drive all the way over here amen to sing something the lord has given her but it was quite a blessing and there was one section in there that really touched me and really blessed me because it's the subject that i'm preaching on tonight and so i love when god does something like that it's such an encouragement i'd like to continue on with that series i was on the unexpected fulfillment this is the unexpected fulfillment part five and i want to talk about the marriage of the lamb amen so remember the series is the unexpected fulfillment amen and it's so good this past sunday we were talking about um talking about god's word brings order and and i was just sharing with you what i had shared with the brothers and the ministers meeting on zoom and it so blessed me and i was so thankful for that and and not to get into church order but just to show that god has order amen and the purpose of that order so blessed me and and i had a little bit more in that but i just felt not to go there to come back here so i thank god for that i just felt to go this direction i did and god sent sister jackie over to sing a song to let me know that we're on the right track amen so we thank god for that amen when we look at look at this the unexpected fulfillment we've been talking about how we have prophecies in the old testament and those old testament prophecies when it comes time for them to come into manifestation for the fulfillment of the prophecy that the fulfillment of the prophecy never looks like the intellectual understanding of that prophecy like we the best example the one that we've been using all the way through is when john the baptist came and john the baptist was the fulfillment of the prophecy out of isaiah and out of malachi amen behold i send my messenger before my face to prepare the way and isaiah he's going to make a highway in the wilderness he's going to make the high places low and the low place is high and the crooked priest is straight amen and he's going to do all of these things but but when you read those prophecies there's no way that when you read the prophecy in in understanding the language and being able to read the book there's no way that you can envision a man with a beard wrapped in camel's hair amen standing on the bank of jordan screaming for you to repent like when you read the prophecy you cannot come up with that picture and so then you can understand why it was easy to miss john the baptist ministry in fact the more intellectual you are and the more bible trained you were the more likely you were to miss it amen and even in jesus ministry jesus came as the fulfillment of the prophecies and the prophecy was speaking of one whom would sit on his father's throne as father david so he was going to come to be a king and he was going to the government was going to be upon his shoulder and he was going to be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the prince of peace amen he was going these are all wonderful titles and when when you read those as a jew under bondage to rome and you begin to read that prophecy you can see how it'd be easy to envision a mighty warrior coming on the scene a mighty god in the flesh who will drive out amen the romans and set up the kingdom amen restore the kingdom and set up the throne of david and and that's why when jesus came humble and meek and he was lonely and born in a manger and raised up by obscure parents and even his birth had a had a suspicion about it amen and rumors that would fly all of these things when when you see that they could not they could not look at jesus and they could not see the prophecy out of isaiah but he was standing there fulfilling the prophecy out of isaiah so it has so the the prophecy has an unexpected fulfillment it's a fulfilled in an unexpected way and brother man said god often does things in an unusual way an unusual manner and the prophecy was filled exactly according to the word but not according to the predetermined conception and that's why when the predetermined conception and the fulfillment don't match the fulfillment is rejected and man holds on to his conception and that's why it's so dangerous amen to have everything already figured out amen it was dangerous in that day it's dangerous in this day amen but god amen he god interprets his word by bringing it to pass and when he brings it to pass he has a he has a mechanism called revelation amen where he can get the the revelation to his elect predestinated seed and he can reveal to them that this is the fulfillment of that and that's the only way that it ever works it doesn't work any other way study won't do it coercion won't do it threats won't do it force won't do it persuasive speech won't do it there's no other way to get somebody to recognize the word that's coming to manifest in their day other than for god to have a prophecy laid down in god to interpret his word by bringing it to pass and then when he brings it to pass he gives a gift of revelation a revelation that comes from the father that will open the eyes of his children to see that this is it amen so you can see why why all down through the bible what god was doing was always being missed by the masses every fulfillment you go down and look at every single fulfillment when god is fulfilling his word and he's working through a prophet he's fulfilling prophecy and he's bringing about everything that he prophesied to do amen in the fulfillment it's missed by the masses only a few ever received the fulfillment of god and as it's coming unfolded so we find ourselves in the same situation today amen god is god has fulfilled his word amen that he promised us in luke 17 30 and in malachi i mean for god has already fulfilled that that's that's passed for us but most of the world doesn't know it only a few people know it amen because it came in an unexpected way it came through an unexpected source in an unexpected location in an unexpected way amen but why is it though the millions and billions of the people in the world cannot see that that ministry was the fulfillment of malachi 4 cannot see it was the fulfillment of luke 17 30. amen but you have no problem seeing that and you're less educated sorry not as well equipped not not as well known but for you it's no problem you say that's that amen malachi 4 i saw it amen luke 17 30 i witnessed it i believe that amen that wasn't from your intellect that wasn't from study or your ability to read the only way that you can get those two things together your revelation and the fulfillment of the word is because god has given you a revelation that's why it's hard to have a revelation of the word and be proud and arrogant because if you really caught a revelation of the word not because you agreed mentally you could see it and tied it together you could be really arrogant about those things because you tied it together somebody taught you and my dad and mom and pastor and i've got this thing all figured out amen that's not real revelation anything that thing will fizzle as soon as the fire gets close to it but when it comes to a real genuine revelation from god amen it'll stand the test of persecution it'll stand the questionings that come from the world and religious people and family it'll it'll take all of those things and at the end of the day you'll be able to say amen even though i can't always explain it i can't make you see it i know that this is true amen and there's no way you can get arrogant or puffed up about that because sometimes you can't even explain yourself it's not intellectual amen it's not any of those things it's something that god has given and when god gives it and you know that god gave it and you know you had nothing to do with it all you can say is thank you god for eyes to see and ears to hear i didn't do it myself i was incapable of doing him i think one of the greatest blessings amen that god has ever done for me is let me believe this message for 20 some years and while believing the message he let me get the wrong idea about things brother branham said amen and then would come and give me a revelation that would totally unravel my thinking so that i could see how flawed my intellectual understanding is and how perfect god's revelation is so that i will finally get to the point where says i don't know anything why the scripture says when you think you know something you know nothing as you ought so the minute you think you know something well i really know what that seventh seal is i'll tell you right now you don't know it like you ought to hey amen that's the truth no matter what if we think we know anything we don't know it as we ought to so praise be to god i said god help me to know it as i ought to amen i love the real the real so much different than the phony it brings such a different character it brings such a different uh attitude it brings such a different approach and i love the real let's turn to matthew 25 together matthew 25 and i'll begin reading in verse 1. then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to the ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they they were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him so that brother branham refers to all the time as the midnight cry amen that was the cry that brother branham gave amen he was the one crying behold the bridegroom cometh go out ye to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh amen brother branham preached on this quite a bit and if you know that and every time brother brennan preached on this he was not he he did not preach on this future tense he always preached this present tense he said do you see all the denominations going to try to buy oil he says when you see that that's when he comes amen and brother branham is showing that this this matthew 25 is taking place while he's on earth because he's the one with the with the midnight cry amen he's the one calling out the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him and so that's that's his ministry amen calling the bride out amen at the coming of the lord to meet the lord and where is he calling them out of calling them out of the city calling them out what's the city it's a type of jerusalem it's a type of the old church system and he's calling them out of the church system calling him out of the laodicean system to go meet the lord and so they awoke and trimmed their lamps when the midnight cry went out so brother branham is is over and over and over he's relating this he's relating this matthew 25 to his day to his ministry to events that are taking place in his time amen just go and listen to what he says and he does it over and over and over again and he's calling you to go out to meet him and then some went to buy oil and brother bennett began to explain that he says you see these methodists and the presbyterians and neither the lutherans and catholics amen they're going to try to go get the holy ghost they're going out and looking for oil amen and they won't find it amen but they're all they're all looking there's been a great revival that have hit the land and they're all looking for something amen but they're missing the very the very source amen the very thing so then it comes and it says while they were gone looking for oil while they went to buy the bridegroom come came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut they went in with him to the marriage hold that in your mind they went in with him those who came out to meet him who left the city to go out and meet him at the midnight cry they went with him into the marriage praise be to god in the message ashamed brother brennan this is from 1965 brother graham said surely there is something in this word of god from genesis to revelation some character in there that you dealt with would be on some basis that would would be my question and if somebody done something and you go after them about it then let me turn to that place in the bible brother branham is asking god to answer something for him he's disturbed about something in his ministry and he wants an answer from the lord and he's saying surely in this bible you've dealt with somebody in a certain way you've corrected him you've said something that'll help me and so he's turning to the bible and asking god to give him an answer to his question and he said and if somebody whatever they done it'll lean my way where i've done wrong or something you want me to do or haven't done let me see some character in the bible like that i closed my eyes just let the bible fall open put my finger on the scripture genesis 24 7 eliezer abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the bible being sent to hunt the bride for isaac and brother bam says chills run over me i hope a few chills run over you because god is identifying this man's ministry and when god identifies this man's ministry his ministry is that of eliezer to go and hunt a bride for isaac so if god is identifying this man's ministry and this man's ministry came to you to call you out then who are you if you can identify that ministry and if god can identify that ministry and he says to chills he said chills run over me oh chills run over me friends amen because of he's eliezer and he come and called me and united me with somebody who am i and who am i united with what was he here doing chills run over me sure that's my that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the bride pulling him out by what a midnight cry behold the bridegroom cometh he said he goes back to the scripture he said swear that you'll not take a bride out of these but go to my own people he said what if the woman won't come with me said then you're free from this oath he said and the god of heaven will send his angel before you to direct you he went right straight out and begin praying and he met the beautiful rebecca that become the bride of isaac just a perfect message back to the word go get that bride that's a duty that's what i'm here for that's what i'm trying to do is call out a bride when was he calling out the bride when did the midnight call come when the bridegroom was coming it all happens at the same time let's go to revelation 19. revelation 19. and verse 6 and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god so we read in this scripture that there was a there was a voice of many waters and thunderings crying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready amen when we when we look at this call and then i would i would like to bring your attention to the fact that in the book of revelations and throughout the bible amen god is showing a prophecy amen through matthew 25 he's showing a prophecy of a midnight cry coming amen of of wise virgins going in when when he cometh and going in with him he shows a prophecy here or he shows a fulfillment in revelation 19 amen the marriage of the lamb is come and the bride hath made herself ready amen but when i look through the scriptures and i look through them i never see the actual marriage where do you see the actual marriage it's a mystery in the bible it's hidden you see that the marriage has come and the bride has made herself ready and describes that she's ready but who's doing the ceremony who says what what's happening there's a mystery amen you don't see the marriage in the bible you see the preparation you see the calling amen you see the the bridegroom call you see the virgins go out and they go in with them into the marriage you see amen the the bride and her preparation and she's now made herself ready but you don't see the marriage because the marriage is in secret amen it's hidden amen it's even hidden in the bible these things are written this way for a reason amen and i want to look at this quote and proving his word and i just want to keep working with this thought as we meditate on it proving his word now we say he's raised from the dead i didn't say it the weird word here said it he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday yesterday same yesterday and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last days the same son of man will be made manifest now the same son of man will be made manifest is that true in the last days was the same son of man made manifest but was he made manifest in the same vessel now he was made manifest and another vessel he's made manifest in the prophet of the age but it's the same son of man and we realize that when god goes to fulfill his word and he and he brings his word to pass amen he he doesn't do it according to our intellectual understanding because we have a certain expectation amen if if this is going to be the coming of the son of man and revealing himself then we're looking for that same vessel that same one amen but but that that one who died amen at calvary jesus christ and the flesh he rose again and he showed himself to his disciples but when when when when when the one disciple thomas when thomas he said i won't believe until i can put my fingers in the nail prints and thrust my hand into his side so jesus presents himself to disciples and said thomas come and put thy finger in my hand and thrust thy hand on my side and thomas says my my god amen he calls him god he recognizes who this is but jesus said because you see you believe but blessed is those who don't see and believe because we're moving from jewish faith to gentile faith and the gentile faith does not have to have the tangible physical like the jewish does to believe [Music] thomas was a jew he had to see the resurrected lord he had to touch his his nail prints he had to thrust his side but you and i will not get that privilege amen to touch that amen in this dispensation of time but yet i believe he's here every bit just the same and there was a blessing amen to come on those who would not see yet believe that's why paul the apostle in his ministry paul is constantly he's preaching to the gentiles and he's constantly taking things that were physical to the jews and he's making them spiritual to the gentiles and this is paul's ministry paul paul is taking an exodus an actual physical exodus where they left egypt in slavery amen and they moved through physical land and they had physical manna come and physical water come out of a rock and brother paul takes that amen and he takes that same thing and he types it to what was going on in their day and said that was done for our example so that we would know how to conduct ourselves and not to fail the way they failed it's paul in hebrews 12 says you've not come to a mountain that can be touched that burns with fire but you've come to mount zion he's saying you've come to a mountain but not a mountain you can touch so the question is did you come to a mountain like they went to a mountain absolutely just the same thing is happening in this dispensation that happened under moses but moses was the physical paul is bringing it to the supernatural the spiritual fulfillment god gave them a sign of circumcision amen now paul takes circumcision and makes it spiritual circumcision the circumcision of the heart is that right jesus tells them that you must eat my my flesh and you must drink my blood but the apostle paul sorts that out and shows that the elements in communion are symbolic of a spiritual partaking amen of his word and of his life is that right so we've we as gentiles all the way down through 2 000 years of church history have not had a problem recognizing our circumcision is an invisible circumcision our communion is in a visible communion all of the armor that we armored with the shield the helmet it's all invisible we've had no problem for 2000 years that the mount zion we've come to the great company of angels to the blood of the lamb it was all invisible and we've had no problem with that amen so so being gentiles we shouldn't have problems believing what you don't see when the word is fulfilled they meant it's fulfilled amen we don't have to see to believe we have to see the fulfillment and by revelation we can say that's it a amen so brother branham is saying now and continue in proving his word he says now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts in sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus he had not been born he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty and jesus says as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as church seed not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride so what was this revelation of the son of man to do it was to unite the headship of christ the word has come back to the bride that's been called out of the churches amen there's a calling out and there's a coming just like matthew 25 there's a calling out come out to meet him and there's a coming of the headship that right so we have a coming and a coming out and when you come out and he comes then you meet and it unites the two together in the marriage of the bride that's what this ministry and brother branham was supposed to do this eleazar was supposed to fetch a bride for isaac and breeding the bride all the way to isaac amen his the eliezer ministry was not just to say hey you're the bride but to bring the bride all the way to a union with christ that what eliezer did amen so this has been revealed now this the day of the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this what bridegroom call the midnight cry matthew 25. we'll come right through this when the son of man will come down behold the bridegroom cometh the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together what's the uniting two together that's the marriage of the bride the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what i mean it's son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and we'll make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage so where's the marriage it's got to be here amen what's the marriage it's the invisible union of the bride in christ that's the marriage the son of the revealing of the son of man has come to unite the the coming of the son of man and unite the bride that's come out and take the headship in the body and put it together in a union that is the marriage some people won't get married until the wedding supper too late amen you've got to get married now some people want to wait to see something to get married amen this is an invisible union remember the words of the prophet amen don't wait to see something to get married when you've seen the revelation of the son of man then you know that the revelation of the son of man is what the bridegroom call came through the midnight cry came through this revelation of the son of man and this revelation of the son of man has come to unite to first it's an eliezer to call out a bride to isaac to bring a bride out amen the bridegroom call and then amen to bring the headship of the word down and the bride that's called out together and this ministry was to unite the two together praise god she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage see feel yourself of the flesh of mighty men because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing so now it's it's easy we've talked about these things many times this is old news but i just love it it doesn't get old to me we see in the ministry amen of the revealing of the son of man through a prophet we've heard the midnight call we've seen the ministry of eliezer and so we can get so fixated on the ministry of eleazar and the midnight cry amen and the in the uh the revealing of the son of man that we miss that all of that came to do something to me all of that came to unite me amen first it came to call me out to get me to leave that church condition amen to get me to leave it behind so it came to call me out to recognize that he's come amen and then they come to unite the two together amen so that i can go with him into the marriage praise god let's go to revelation chapter 3. revelation chapter 3 verse 14. and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not thou are wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked i counseled thee the buy of me gold tried the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed see when we read in revelations 19 amen she was clothed in white raiment which is the righteousness of the saints and here in the laodicean church age amen christ is trying to get her amen to recognize you're you're not clothed amen you're miserable you're wretched amen but come to me buy of me gold buy of me raiment amen i've got something to clothe you with i've got something to give you wealth i've got something to close you clothe you with in this age amen i'll read verse 18 again i counseled you to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes out that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh what i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcome and sit down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches so here we find in the end time and the laodicean church age we find christ on the outside of the church knocking amen and that's why brother branham starts preaching and paul starts preaching in i think it's hebrew 13 he said he suffered outside the gate now let us go in unto him without the gate bearing his reproach and you see everything in this laodicean age shows that in laodicea there is a wretched naked miserable condition but there's got to be a calling out amen to have the gold and the raiment and the isaf and all of that you've got to go out to where he is and he is on the outside which matches matthew 25 which matches eliezer because he has to bring her out amen when he brings her out he gives her all kinds of gold and he gives her arraignment he gives her all kinds of stuff and then she gets all the gifts and then she gets brought out so everything is lining up for this final age that you have to come out and you have to be clothed with the garment that's provided and you've got to be called out he says behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice if any man hear my voice what's he knocking with he's knocking with a voice and that voice is the midnight cry amen it is the one with the revelation of the son of man it is malachi 4 it is the voice amen if anyone hear my voice then you come out and become one with him amen in 1964 the prophet says when their eyes were opened they knew him and that message he says so it is today the god that they claim that they believe that manifest himself you will shut up every door no cooperation cooperation no nothing else it's contrary to their creeds oh fools and slow of hearing to know the day that we live in has not god promised this in the last day how this laodicean church would be lukewarm and jesus on the outside trying to get in for a little cooperation what is what is jesus the word the true word that's made manifest on the outside trying to get in and couldn't get in amen he come in the last day he come in the end time and he could not get in they would not let the word into the system amen they rejected it and that's why brother branham could come in 1963 and preach indictment and i indict this bunch of clergy i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ by what by by crucifying the effects of the word amen because the word was restored which is nothing more than jesus christ amen and they rejected christ in the laodicean age and left him on the outside amen and there's a bridegroom call saying the bridegroom cometh come out to meet him now he suffered without the gate because they wouldn't let him in and they crucified him afresh so now we must go to him without the gate bearing his reproach what reproach are we bearing the same reproach that moses bore in his day because moses amen he forsook egypt and all the riches thereof amen esteeming the reproaches of christ greater riches than all of egypt so moses had to leave egypt and go out to bear the reproach of christ we have to leave laodicea and leave the church systems leave the denominational system and go out and bear his reproach well was he in moses's day he was the word made manifest for that day and moses went with that word that prophecy coming to fulfillment and he had to bear the reproach of that word coming flesh in his day there's nothing different in our day we're bearing the reproach for the word made flesh in our day so the bridegroom call tells us he's come he's coming come out to meet him amen in the message the present stage in my ministry says well all men has forsaken me but there's one thing he stood by me i wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision that happened down there on the river i've stayed true to him he's been true to me amen i'm trusting in him someday i don't know when for a crowning of my ministry i've stayed just as true as i could be i don't know what it'll be i don't know when it'll be and just when he's ready i'm done up here i hope that he will crown my ministry of this of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothes of the word and for his righteousness i hope he will crown me let me stand on that day say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world brother branham is saying that i hope for the crowning of my ministry he lets me take the clothes of the word and he lets me dress his bride in the clothes of the word hey listen we know who this is amen this is eleazar fetching a bride for isaac this is the one who gives the midnight cry the bridegroom cometh this is malachi 4. this is the fulfillment of luke 17 30 the revelation of the son of man this is the one that will come amen and come and when the son of man comes in the flesh to manifest himself to unite the two together in the marriage of the bride this is that man and that man is saying i hope that for a crowning of my ministry he lets me clothe amen take the clothes of the word and dress that bride and so now you go to revelation 19 and in revelation 19 the bride has made herself ready let's read it revelation 19 verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints where did she get this linen where did she get her clothing where did it come from amen it came from eliezer amen brother branham's calling for the crowning of his ministry to be the very thing that she needs to be dressed in in revelation 19 and said listen we're not looking for physical physical manifestation i would like to tell you right now amen that this garment i'm wearing amen and this garment is the word amen it's jesus christ the word i've been clothed in the word that come from the ministry of a prophet the word has been restored and that clothes was put to a bride and this bride has made herself ready by submitting to that ministry and putting the clothes on and if you have the wedding garment if you have the clothes amen is it possible you can be in revelation 19 amen amen where are we i mean what are we looking for what dress is she going to wear where's the ceremony who's the officiant of the ceremony oh it's an invisible union and i've got on an invisible dress amen you can't see it in this dimension but i promise you in another dimension it's showing up amen and i've been clothed amen with what eliezer has provided in this day what haggai has provided for esther she put on and she required nothing more but what heggy i had appointed all of these things are pointing to the same thing friends we have to understand i've heard the midnight cry i've went out to meet him with oil in my lamb i've got the wedding garment on because a prophet has has given and has provided it it's the crowning of his ministry amen and the crowning of his ministry is to close me for a wedding what's the dress it's the word let's go to romans chapter 3. you say what are you trying to do brother chad i'm trying to get you to see your day and its message and quit looking to the future romans 2 romans chapter 3 verse 21 but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifest being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there's no difference where do you get this righteousness and how can you get it put on it's the faith of jesus christ that's unto all them that believe that believe what oh i believe certain verses out of the bible and i believe that something happened two thousand years ago on galgoth no to believe him to believe the word when the word is present tense today and there's a righteousness amen the righteousness of god which comes by the faith of jesus christ you have to have the faith of jesus christ amen [Music] to those who believe let's go to philippians chapter 3. i hope i can find philippians yeah philippians chapter 3 verse 9. and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith remember she's clothed in a garment that's righteousness that's her righteousness now let's go to galatians chapter 3. galatians 3 and 26. for year all the children of god by faith in christ jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ what did you put on amen you put on the anointed word for your day amen you put on what the prophet has given us which is the word what is the prophet giving us the word amen he wanted to take the clothe of the word to dress a bride what did he restore to us the word what has come back in our hands the word what are we putting on we're putting on christ which is the righteousness of god by by the faith of christ by the faith of jesus christ to them that believe that believe what that believe the day that we're in that believe what what thomas needed to touch you don't need to touch to believe you can touch him with a with a different touch you can see him with different eyes you can hear him with different ears and the message the rapture brother ma'am says we can't we can forgive but we couldn't for we we could forgive you but always remember you've done those evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never did in the first place amen standing there married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place why she was four ordained she was trapped into this and now and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous she see no sin in her at all brother branham now is looking at a bride he's here in 1965 in december of 1965 his ministry is almost over it's almost time for him to leave and he begins declaring amen in 1965 that because she's been washed by the water of the word she now stands as the sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ and when he comes here to the rapture he says what she's standing there married brother branham said she's married paul says i've espoused you brother branham says his lease are going to fetch a bride but here in december of 1965 three or four weeks before god takes him home he says she's standing here married to the virtuous son of god i didn't see the marriage when you read revelation 19 let's see if we could erase everything we know about the message and go back to revelation 19 and and you could hear all the shoutings and thunderings and hallelujah and praise be to god for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and you come to that oh i just want to read it because it's so good to me revelation 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he sayeth unto me these are the true sayings of god when you read this scripture you can say oh the the bride amen his wife have made herself ready and she's been appointed a fine white linen garment amen which is the righteousness of the saints amen we're coming i would say to a major event a major event in the entire bible i would say we're coming to one of the most major events in the entire bible and then one of the most major events in the entire bible is the marriage of the lamb would you say that but when you come to the marriage of the lamb it's a big deal it's a big event it's got to be huge there's got to be bridal attendance and there's got to be a horse-drawn carriage and there's got to be trumpets blowing there's got to be this and there's got to be that and there's got to be this but brother branham and his ministry amen he's there with the bridegroom call he's there amen with the clothes of the word he's there with the water of purification to purify bride he's there with everything until he can finally said she's married he can preach invisible union and the marriage took place and what happened where was it i didn't see it i missed it the biggest event in all the bible and i just missed it when was it what service what happened ah i didn't see it he he's the forerunner okay he's the forerunner he's the midnight call okay he's got the he's got the clothes of the word okay i got all this we're preparing for marriage he's lease they're calling him i got it i got it i got it we come to the end he preaches invisible union what happened where was the marriage where was this huge event where was this event that we've been waiting for for thousands and thousands of years the marriage of the lamb what is it it's a secret friends it's the third pool you won't tell this to nobody it's the event that takes place in the little room under the tent and you go in one by one and come out and can't describe it what is it it's the third pool it's the mystery under the seventh seal it's private it's huge is it huge nobody knew big huge event that man has waited for for 6 000 years and it happens and nobody knows brother branham said don't look for great big things amen that's why when he started preaching the seals he started with god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same if you're looking for the big event you've missed it because god can turn this earth on its axes and it never creaks it never pops it never makes a sound he can evaporate two million gallons of water off the earth when the sun comes up and you never hear it amen big things brother branham are that are silent they go unnoticed amen and now you've come in the bible all it says is he come and he took her into the marriage what happened i mean what was the meeting like who was there what was who sang the songs who did the service it doesn't tell us anything he said he came and they went into the marriage brother branham said he's coming he's coming the bridegroom is coming get ready come out to meet him put on the garment get ready follow me i'm taking you to isaac and now before he leaves the scene he says she's married now standing married to the virtuous son of god [Music] i don't get it you will stick with him and you will we're looking everybody's looking for something huge and it's huge but it's invisible you have the sword of the spirit which is the word of god is that sword powerful it's the sword of the king isn't it in this third pool show it to me it's invisible you have a helmet of salvation that protects your mind under the word of god you have one right it'll defend you against the blows of the devil show it to me you have a shield of faith is that shield of faith is it able to stop all the fiery darts of the enemy show it to me just because it's invisible doesn't mean it's not great just because it's invisible doesn't mean it's not powerful just because it's invisible doesn't mean it's not greater than anything you can see it doesn't mean it wasn't a it's not a great event it doesn't mean it's not powerful it doesn't mean your garment is not pure white which is your righteousness which what is it it's the righteousness of god which is his word that has been put on you by grace and he came when they were all looking for oil and he came and he took them into the marriage who in the city saw it who knew besides the bridegroom and the virgins who knew what happened who could explain it who was there as an eyewitness who was the reporter at the end of the little room when they were coming out changed into the tablet a paper saying what happened in there they said i don't know unwritten word no explanation you go to revelation 19. big event coming big event coming big event coming amen now she's ready she's dressed in white the marriage of the lamb has come what happened blessed is he who's called to the marriage supper you know you realize in in the in the ancient weddings amen they would come the the bridegroom would come and he would have somebody that would announce is coming he'd announce his coming and the bride would come out it was all pre-arranged she would come out with him and he would take him back and she would he would take her back to a little room that was prepared called the bridal chamber and they would first themselves alone enter into the bridal chamber and they had to go and consummate the marriage he had to take her into the marriage first before the marriage supper started and after they went into the bridal chamber and consummated marriage after that that's when the wedding supper started that's why don't try to wait for the wedding supper to get married amen it's private it's in the little room it's in the bridal chamber it's just the bridegroom and the bride that's it nobody's invited into the marriage everybody's invited to the wedding supper but the marriage is private go to genesis 24. i would say maybe it's fair to say this that the marriage of the lamb is an unexpected fulfillment i don't even know how the denominations teach this because when i was there they weren't even talking about that part they left those things alone but what's the denominational idea of the marriage of the lamb you know what their idea is it's humongous but in reality it's invisible let's look at eleazar bringing rebecca back in genesis 24 we know all that happens there it's a familiar story but i want to look here i want to start a paragraph or verse 63 sorry genesis chapter 24 63. now if you'll let me do this just just just for fun just let me do this for fun don't make a doctrine out of this but let's take 63 as 1963. and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventing and he lifted up his eyes and saw behold the camels were coming so where was he at amen he went out into field amen in the evening time the evening time message and in the evening time he goes out to the field to watch for her to come amen and and he's out not at home he's between home and between her place he's between heaven and between earth maybe like a cloud in 1963 so let me just do this for fun don't make a doctrine out of it 1963 isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening time and he lifted up his eyes and saw behold the camels were coming 1964 and rebecca lifted up her eyes when she saw isaac she went lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel in 1965 for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant that said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself it was 1965 when brother branham was told to take the picture and turn it to the right amen because the identification of isaac comes to the bride in 1965 that's a cloud that's a pyramid that's a capstone that's seven angels and she says who is that in the field up there and the prophet eliezer says told turn it to the right and said it's my lord up there it's isaac in 1965. this is fun for me 1966 brother ben is now off the scene he's not speaking to rebecca anymore and the servant told isaac all things that he had done it's like he goes home and makes a report or something 1967 and isaac brought her unto his mother sarah's tent and took rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mother's death this is the wedding of the promised son this is the marriage of the promised son elias are fetched a bride eliezer went and got the bride eliezer showered her with gifts and then brought her back on a camel train brought her back on all this stuff but when she comes back amen in the evening time amen he comes out amen not not in the heavens and not on the earth but kind of in between she lifts up her eyes and she sees the clown and in 1965 she had asked who is this amen and eliezer says it's my lord up there it's the promised son and she wrapped a veil around herself she veiled herself in that word she had got while she was writing with eleazar all that time and she went to meet her and here comes the climax here comes the marriage here comes where she's going to become his wife amen how many attendants how many guests where's abraham where's the musicians where's everything all he does is take her after she leaves la's or eliezer gives a report and he takes her into the tent and she becomes his wife i thought the marriage of abraham abraham was a very wealthy man i thought the marriage of abraham would be a bigger deal than this i thought there would be lots of people i thought there would be i mean slain oxes and slain calves and milk or pouring in wine by the plenty and all the things that you would expect when the promised sign amen got this wife that this this faithful servant went and fetched in a far country and brought back through a journey amen and on all of this effort and isaac just takes her to himself and he goes into the tent just the two of them and she becomes his wife oh praise god don't miss the marriage it's that simple it's that profound and that simple it's that great and that simple the message marriage and divorce now brother ben is preached in 1965 he says he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him him saying by himself his children begin to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing they become children of the word not children of the church children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made theory she'll be purely unadulterated bride of the word amen amen i hope you get that on the air she'll be the pregnant daughter of god what's this brother brandon talking about a pregnant bride i want to see the ceremony first amen christ is the mystery of god revealed he said the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it's husband and wife again and as long as you're pregnanted with the same word which is his body you took his body become him when you took the word one more choosing of a bride the other is pregnanted by the word of god and will bring forth the body the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride brother branham has got so far past the marriage now he's here in 1965 and he's preaching a pregnant bride pregnated by the word who's come in union with her husband the two have united as one she's received his word amen and now she is bringing forth the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride i want to see the finished body of jesus christ amen look to the right look to the left don't miss it amen don't miss what he's doing don't miss how great this is this there's been a marriage there's been an impregnation of the word and now there's a bride who's bringing forth the finished body of jesus christ which is the bride the bride manifestation is the finishing of the body of jesus christ but she had to unite with the head she had to come into the invisible union she had to receive the word and be pregnant by the word and now she has to bring forth the word and manifestation for this day which is in bright form amen the body of christ isn't finished yet how many knows that a man and his woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man his wife are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own and his mind of course is his word and his word his will is his word this bride she's been washed she's been called washed clothed united impregnated and now she's bringing forth the finished body of jesus christ but i didn't see anything i did you realize when it comes to the third pool it doesn't matter what anybody else sees when it comes to the seventh seal in the third pool it matters not what the masses see because there was a lot of people in that tent that day and even the prophet of god was raised up in an elevated position looking down and the prophet of god and all the people had no idea what was happening in that little room they couldn't describe to you what was happening they couldn't explain what was happening and the people who were walking through the room they were undergoing a complete change they were changing they were being transformed they were being made new again and they were coming out the other side and they couldn't even explain to you what happened in that little room all that they knew is they were changed this one is not a public show and this union is not a public show for it takes place in the bridal chamber with only the bridegroom and only the bride everybody is looking for something big it is big it's huge it's bigger than the earth turning on its axis it's bigger than that did you see the earth turning did you feel it did you know it was turning how did you know it was turning well other people explained it to me i mean how did you prove it did you feel it did you go far enough away to see it no this is bigger than that but under the third pool it doesn't matter what anybody else sees when it comes to the third pool you cannot rely on what anybody else sees in the third pull all that matters is what you see amen i don't care amen on that day when people saw virgins leaving the city amen they saw lamps going through the dark they heard a noise the bridegroom coming they saw and heard all of this amen it doesn't matter what the descriptions are what they heard one thing they didn't know and one thing they didn't see and one thing they could not explain is what happened after he closed the door and i say under the third pull all that matters is what you see and what you see amen is only given to you by the revelation of god and if you see by god's revelation if you know that you've entered into the marriage with the lamb amen then it doesn't matter what anybody else says because you were there and when they ask you to explain it you've got a really good thorough pulled vision that gives you the right to say i can't explain it because in the vision they couldn't explain it it's not always explainable you can talk about it but you can't explain it amen you can point to it amen you can try to talk all around it amen but it's you and jesus christ becoming persons together it's an invisible union man i'd like to finish this in isaiah 62 if we could turn there i'd like for you to just think for me for with me for a moment those who have gone in to the marriage with the lamb they know it they've experienced it and you know it doesn't so much matter what anybody else says or anybody else thinks anymore because it's my experience and you can see how necessary the third pool is now because the third pull of the ministry is the opening of the word and it's a revelation to you of who jesus christ is and it's a union of you in christ an invisible union and the reason brother them saw in the little room and couldn't describe it because he wasn't allowed to talk about him when he comes to the seventh seal he he feels to stop he's not going to explain it he's good he's going to tell you about visions and about things that happen but he can't tell it to you amen because when you come down to the third pool amen god is trying to build a security in the church that nothing else can create because if there's an explanation somebody else can have a different explanation if there's a picture painted in the bible amen even if the marriage is described in the bible you can have different interpretations so in the bible you don't ever see an explanation of the marriage you just see the bride's prepared the marriage has come what happened i don't know the bridegroom call has come they go out and meet him went in what happened i don't know it's not described in the bible amen brother branham couldn't talk about it what happened in the little room nobody could explain what is god trying to do he's trying to break us off a need for camaraderie and somebody to believe like i believe and somebody to be able to explain it to me and for an intellectual reason he's trying to break us from all the denominational holds and under the third pull the third pull not being explained explainable being private between you and jesus christ is to do one thing it's to get you so solidly rooted in a private revelation amen that nobody can move you ever again no sway of denomination no system no intellectual speeches he's trying to break the church free from that and unite her to himself because there's many times i thought i don't get it explain it tell me teach me amen if he had somebody would explain something else but it comes down so personal to a relationship with me in christ that i've met him and he's revealed himself to me and nobody can take that away from me the opening of the word the seventh seal has become real to me can you explain it really well no i can't explain it really well every time i try eventually i run out somewhere and i run out of words i run out of examples but but it doesn't matter amen it's me and my lord it's him coming for me it's me hearing the bridegroom call getting the garment on being washed by the word and uniting with him it's him now wanting to live through me and it's an individual revelation to one person that's why when brother branham comes to christ as the mystery of god revealed he said all hell is against this teaching to the individual the revelation one person not a group one man one person all hell is against this because it's actually the only thing that will give you rock solid security and when we come closer and closer to the wrapping up of all things you're going to find out that that third pool is the only thing that'll work you know brother bam told us many times that they'll close churches like this and they'll try to stop the bride from preaching and he says all kinds of things like that and you wonder about that how will it happen could it be this and could it be that i don't know he'll he'll he'll interpret his word by bringing it to pass i believe that but look at the wisdom of god because once his bride amen catches the mystery laying under the seventh seal and comes into her own union with him god can pull every support away because the revelation is all she needs that's the only thing she needs is to know who he is and who she is in him that's the only revelation that she needs and i say we don't realize how important this third pool is and how the reason it was displayed in the vision the way it was the reason brother brennan explained it the way it was the reason he preached to seven steel the way he did the reason he preached christ is the mystery the way he did the reason he preached invisible union is all for the same thing amen he has to come to you you've got to come out of the city and he's got to come to you and through this son of man ministry it's got to unite the two together and what in the marriage and then what's not described in revelation 19 doesn't need to be described to you because it's experienced not described it's real not just red it's amazing let's read isaiah 62 together and we'll finish with this let's read verse 1 for zion's sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem's sake i will not rest until the righteous thereof go forth is brightness and the salvation thereof is the lamp that burneth the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings thy glory and now shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate i want you to think of the description of the laodicean church when you look at this this has an application to the jews and has an application to the bride he says thou shalt no more be termed miserable wretched poor blind and naked [Applause] thou shalt no more amen be turned forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be term desolate but thou shalt be called hepsiba hepsima means my delight is in her thou shall be called my delight is in her hebsiba and thy land the beulah which means married for thy lord delighteth in thee in thy land shall be married amen what is your land your land is the word amen and the word is christ and your land is married and you're now ah you're no longer miserable poor wretched blind and naked you're now you're now hebsaba my delight is in her i'm not part of laodicea anymore i'm the apple of his eye his delight is in me he is lifting me out of laodicea he is united with me i'm now in beulah land this land has been married to me because this land is the word that's been restored and now i'm walking through a married land beulah land and now my name is changed from church to bride because the lord spoken himself said i no longer call you church i'll call you bride so that you'll understand and now my name is hepsiba you can call me hebsibo if you like because i'm no longer forsaken i'm no longer laid to see in i'm no longer part of a church or a denomination or a system of man but i've been freed from all of that and i've come out of the city i've heard a bridegroom call i've been washed by pure water i've been clothed in a beautiful garment of righteousness and i've been united with the lamb the marriage of the lamb has come how do you know because i've united with the lamb that's how i know amen there's a reason it's not described in the bible because it's a mystery in the third pool it's a mystery of the seventh seal i thank god for his word let's all stand be musicians if you'd like to come please let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you i thank you i thank you i thank you lord for eyes to see and ears to hear god we could have never on our own have come to this place if you hadn't fulfilled your word and sent your prophet we would be wandering in the wilderness lord we'd be blind and lost and naked we'd be miserable lord but god you sent a prophet god you worked through him lord the revealing of the son of man and you did all that we needed to come to this marriage and you've come yourself lord you've come in this day you've come in this age you've come to me you've taken me into the marriage lord god i thank you so much lord for what you've done give us lord give us more grace to see lord let us stand on this revelation lord when all else fails let us stand here for god you have united with your bride lord i thank you i ask that you would continue to give out the isab and the wedding garment to those who haven't seen yet may they come out of the city and come to you and go into the marriage with you too lord god one by one you're drawing us in one by one you're bringing us into the wedding chamber to the bridal chamber one by one our eyes are becoming open and we're recognizing who we really are lord i pray that you continue to do the work you would do what only you can do lord that you would give divine supernatural revelation upon your word thank you lord thank you for allowing us to live in this day and thank you for your grace to us we ask your blessings over everything we've said lord may we go and meditate on these things and may what no one else saw become the greatest thing in our lives may the thing that was invisible become the thing that's always before our eyes the event that matters more to us than life is our union with you bless us lord take us along the way for your glory in jesus name we pray amen god bless your
