[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] hallelujah
[0:03] what a wonderful place to be brothers
[0:05] and sisters
[0:06] so happy to be here this morning and so
[0:09] blessed
[0:10] just to be part of the worship and
[0:13] come together and bring our licks of
[0:16] fire together and unite ourselves for
[0:18] one thing
[0:19] and that's to worship him and that's to
[0:21] hear his word
[0:22] man it matters more to us than anything
[0:24] we should be getting to the place moving
[0:27] as as we near the going away it should
[0:30] be that this earth has less and less and
[0:32] less a hold on us
[0:34] one day it's going to lose gravitational
[0:36] hold on us
[0:37] every atom in my body is going to change
[0:40] and i'm going to be a new creation
[0:41] and i'm going to fly away and as we near
[0:44] that time
[0:45] let every grip be loosened let
[0:48] everything lose its hold
[0:49] as we near and come closer and closer to
[0:52] that time
[0:53] brothers and sisters we're at the time
[0:55] we're at the moment
[0:57] amen this is the greatest time oh
[1:00] hallelujah how many attributes of god
[1:02] would have loved to have been born this
[1:03] day
[1:04] and live out this part of the word amen
[1:07] but it's fallen our lot and it's our
[1:09] privilege and it's our opportunity
[1:11] and i don't want to waste one moment i
[1:12] want to be here
[1:14] fully engaged in what my purpose is on
[1:16] this planet
[1:17] hallelujah it's not to serve some
[1:19] company not to serve some man
[1:21] not to build houses and buy cars those
[1:24] are all
[1:24] side things that we do but i've got one
[1:27] purpose and one purpose only
[1:29] and that's to be the reflection of jesus
[1:31] christ
[1:32] amen to be a living word amen a living
[1:34] oracle of god
[1:36] so that others can see that the word is
[1:38] alive today
[1:40] hallelujah if there's anything in our
[1:42] lives that hinder that
[1:44] it's evil let it fall away oh god
[1:48] cast it off of me my father because i
[1:51] want to serve your purpose and your
[1:53] purpose only
[1:55] hallelujah god is good
[1:59] amen hallelujah
[2:02] my heart is full to overflowing
[2:05] all we want is his word we want to live
[2:07] his life
[2:08] we want him to have his way let's just
[2:11] take our bibles and turn
[2:13] to saint luke chapter 24
[2:17] and i can tell you i've been tore up for
[2:19] days and days coming to this
[2:22] god has really been stirring in my heart
[2:25] and
[2:26] and it's hard to grab
[2:29] grab a hold of this thing and bring it
[2:31] into a way that's concise and direct
[2:33] because i feel like that god is opening
[2:36] the whole bible on a whole other level
[2:39] you know and before i felt like you know
[2:41] i would read the bible and before i come
[2:43] to the message
[2:44] i would read and it would just be
[2:45] one-dimensional it would just be print
[2:47] ink on paper you know and i'd read it
[2:50] and i would love it because it's the
[2:51] bible
[2:52] but that's as deep as it went and then i
[2:54] got into the message and it went
[2:56] two-dimensional you know
[2:57] and i began to see it come alive and
[3:00] then it become three-dimensional
[3:02] now it's all around me but oh my
[3:04] goodness it feels like now i've entered
[3:06] into the bible
[3:07] and i'm standing in the pages and i'm
[3:09] walking back and forth
[3:11] and it's all a reality today it's all
[3:13] around us and it's all happening now
[3:16] oh hallelujah what a blessed time this
[3:19] is
[3:20] to be a believer if you're still back on
[3:23] ink on paper i say god i say repent and
[3:26] say god open my eyes
[3:28] come i come to you for i sav and wash
[3:30] the scales out of my eyes
[3:32] so there's more than ink on paper that
[3:34] this is a living word and i can see
[3:37] the revelation of jesus christ in the
[3:39] whole word
[3:41] hallelujah let's i think we should pray
[3:46] let's pray dear heavenly father we thank
[3:49] you lord for this day
[3:52] god i come with a full heart lord and a
[3:54] full surrender
[3:55] god i don't even know how to say what's
[3:57] on my heart i don't even know how to
[3:59] preach
[4:00] lord what what what is burning inside of
[4:02] me but god all i can do is lay myself
[4:04] down here lord
[4:05] and i pray that you would pick up your
[4:07] instrument lord and begin to use it for
[4:09] your glory
[4:10] speak through lips of clay lord move the
[4:12] man out of the way move the humanness
[4:14] and the human element to the side
[4:16] and i pray that you would come in the
[4:18] power of your holy spirit
[4:19] and you would minister your eternal word
[4:21] lord open this book to us all over again
[4:24] god and we might see it with greater
[4:26] depths with greater clarity
[4:28] that we might climb to higher heights
[4:30] than we've ever been to before lord
[4:32] because we know you have to bring a
[4:34] greater faith that comes with
[4:36] by a greater revelation to bring about a
[4:38] rapture lord
[4:39] and we are yielding ourselves to it
[4:41] we're looking for it with anticipation
[4:43] and we pray that you would have your way
[4:45] in this place lord
[4:47] god we give you glory we give you
[4:48] preeminence and we ask all that you and
[4:50] you alone would move on us
[4:52] this morning in jesus christ's name we
[4:55] pray
[4:56] amen look at luke chapter 24
[5:00] verse 13. and behold two of them went
[5:04] that same day to a village called emmaus
[5:06] which was from jerusalem about three
[5:08] score furlongs
[5:10] and they talked together all these
[5:12] things which had happened
[5:13] we know what had happened they had seen
[5:16] they had walked with the lord they had
[5:17] heard the ministry of jesus christ and
[5:19] they had seen him taken and arrested and
[5:22] beaten and crucified
[5:24] and laid in a tomb and and now that
[5:27] they're walking down the road
[5:28] and they're talking about the things
[5:31] that had happened
[5:32] amen and it came to pass that while they
[5:35] commune together
[5:37] and reasoned jesus himself drew near and
[5:39] went with them
[5:40] but their eyes were holding that they
[5:42] should not know him and he said unto
[5:44] them what manner of communications are
[5:46] these that you have one to another as
[5:48] you walk and are sad
[5:50] and the one of them whose name was
[5:51] cleopas answered
[5:53] answered said unto him art thou only a
[5:55] stranger in jerusalem and has not known
[5:57] the things which are come to pass
[6:00] there in these days and he said unto
[6:02] them what things
[6:03] and they said unto him concerning jesus
[6:05] of nazareth which was a prophet
[6:07] mighty indeed and word before god and
[6:09] all the people
[6:10] and how the chief priests and rulers
[6:12] delivered him to be condemned to death
[6:14] and have crucified him
[6:16] but we trusted that it had been he which
[6:18] should have redeemed
[6:20] israel and beside all this today is the
[6:22] third day since these things were done
[6:24] yea and certain women also of our
[6:26] company made us astonished
[6:28] when when we're early at the sepulcher
[6:30] and when they found not his body they
[6:32] came
[6:32] saying that they had also seen a vision
[6:34] of angels
[6:35] which said that he was alive and certain
[6:38] of them which were with us
[6:39] went to the sepulcher and found it even
[6:42] so as the women had said
[6:44] but him they saw not then he said unto
[6:47] them o
[6:47] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[6:50] that the prophets have spoken it wasn't
[6:54] that they didn't believe some of the
[6:55] prophets it wasn't that they weren't
[6:56] believing the word
[6:57] but he condemned them because their eyes
[7:00] were holding they could not see
[7:02] all that the prophets have spoken
[7:05] ought not christ to have suffered these
[7:07] things and to enter into his glory
[7:10] and beginning at moses and all the
[7:12] prophets he expounded unto them
[7:14] all the scriptures the things
[7:18] concerning himself
[7:21] hallelujah
[7:24] and they drew nyan to the village
[7:26] whether they went and made as though he
[7:28] would have gone further but they
[7:30] constrained him saying abide with us for
[7:32] it is toward evening and the day is far
[7:34] spent and he went in to tarry with them
[7:37] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[7:39] with them he took
[7:40] bread and blessed it and break and gave
[7:42] to them and their eyes were opened
[7:45] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[7:47] their sight
[7:48] and they said one to another didn't on
[7:50] our heart burn within us as he talked
[7:52] with us by the way
[7:54] and while he opened to us the scriptures
[7:57] hallelujah you can have your seats
[8:02] so this is a an interesting story we all
[8:04] know it we've heard it many many times
[8:06] but i don't want to breeze over it i
[8:08] don't want to miss
[8:09] the lesson that's in this road to emmaus
[8:12] because here
[8:13] they had walked with the lord they had
[8:14] seen the miracles they had heard his
[8:16] ministry
[8:17] they had they had done all of these
[8:19] things and now they
[8:21] they see the fulfillment of everything
[8:23] that was promised in the bible
[8:25] he was taken he was rejected he was
[8:27] slain
[8:28] amen he he was he was uh uh he was uh
[8:32] um killed he was he was uh stoned in the
[8:36] into the prison house of a grave and he
[8:38] was resurrected again
[8:40] and here they had witnessed with their
[8:42] eyes
[8:43] the fulfillment of scriptures and didn't
[8:46] even know that these were scriptures
[8:48] being fulfilled
[8:49] because in their heart was clouded with
[8:51] doubt their heart had not come to this
[8:53] revelation to where that they could see
[8:55] all the scriptures correctly they were
[8:58] seeing scriptures they were believing
[9:00] scriptures
[9:00] they even believed unto jesus and they
[9:02] didn't believe scriptures about the son
[9:04] of god
[9:05] they were believing these things but
[9:07] when they come to the time to the
[9:09] hour when everything was going to be
[9:11] fulfilled when all that was spoken of
[9:13] him was going to be
[9:14] come to pass then they missed it
[9:17] they had walked with him they had talked
[9:19] with him they had slept with him they
[9:21] had heard him preaching
[9:22] they had done all these things but when
[9:23] they come to the moment when they come
[9:25] to
[9:26] the fulfillment of so many scriptures
[9:28] all at one time
[9:29] when it all got bundled into one package
[9:32] at the at his capture crucifixion and
[9:34] resurrection
[9:35] they missed it and then in his mercy he
[9:39] comes and begins to speak to them
[9:42] and they don't even know who it is and
[9:44] they're talking about him
[9:45] and they're saying you know don't you
[9:48] know what's happened
[9:49] we're concerning jesus of nazareth a
[9:51] mighty prophet
[9:52] and they said you know and he's standing
[9:54] there talking to him the resurrected
[9:56] lord
[9:57] and he's more than a mighty prophet
[10:00] he's more than what they can see him as
[10:03] more is happening than what they even
[10:05] realized and the whole time he was with
[10:07] him it was so much more than what they
[10:08] realized
[10:10] and now he's here and he's talking to
[10:12] them and they're starting to tell
[10:13] you know even these women they saw a
[10:15] vision of angels well i tell you they
[10:17] saw no vision
[10:18] of angels they saw angels but here they
[10:21] are caught in unbelief in a trap of
[10:24] unbelief
[10:24] and now they're using their minds
[10:26] they're using human reasoning
[10:28] and they're trying to make sense of the
[10:29] situation that they're in and this is
[10:32] the very problem
[10:33] that we find ourselves in over and over
[10:36] and over again
[10:37] because there's one solution and only
[10:39] one solution for the condition that they
[10:41] were in
[10:41] and jesus brought them the solution he
[10:44] said oh fools
[10:47] hallelujah i thought he was the one who
[10:50] told us to call no man a fool
[10:53] he comes down and he says oh fools and
[10:56] slow of heart to believe
[10:57] all that the scriptures have said
[11:01] hallelujah there was a solution there
[11:03] was an answer
[11:04] everything was running right on course
[11:06] everything was according to the word of
[11:08] god
[11:09] but their eyes were holding that they
[11:10] could not see him
[11:13] and if they had believed the scriptures
[11:15] they would be rejoicing at this hour
[11:17] amen if they had seen the word they
[11:19] would not be mourning walking to the
[11:21] road to emmaus they would be skipping
[11:23] all the way there
[11:24] shouting and saying hallelujah the
[11:26] redeemer has come
[11:28] the price has been paid we're free from
[11:30] the bondage amen we're free from these
[11:32] bodies of sin
[11:33] we're free from the corruption that is
[11:35] set in but they
[11:36] missed it because they missed the
[11:38] scriptures
[11:41] hallelujah they had
[11:44] seen the ministry of the son of man but
[11:47] they had missed the scriptures
[11:51] hallelujah the same thing could be
[11:53] happening today
[11:54] we could see the ministry of the son of
[11:56] man and miss the scriptures
[11:59] because we have to believe all that the
[12:02] scriptures
[12:03] have said hallelujah
[12:08] brother branham didn't come to bring us
[12:09] anything outside of this word
[12:12] but the message of the hour came to
[12:13] illuminate the scriptures amen
[12:15] they come to point us back to the
[12:18] original faith
[12:19] of the pentecostal fathers amen not to
[12:22] original
[12:23] mind understanding not to original
[12:25] doctrines but to original
[12:26] faith because everything in this book is
[12:29] based off faith
[12:32] amen and so the prophet of god came on
[12:34] the scene
[12:35] and he begins pulling things out of the
[12:37] scriptures amen
[12:38] and we're seeing the miracles and we're
[12:40] seeing the discernment we're seeing all
[12:42] this stuff
[12:43] but how many times have we missed the
[12:45] scriptures
[12:47] we see the day we live in and how many
[12:50] times have we missed the scriptures
[12:53] and then we go to use our mind and come
[12:55] up with reasoning and
[12:56] this is this way because of this reason
[12:58] and i think i ought to do this and
[13:00] the best solution for my problem i
[13:02] believe would be to do this or do that
[13:04] and i say fools and slow of heart to
[13:06] believe because the answer is in the
[13:08] scriptures
[13:12] not human reasoning and so so they're
[13:15] here
[13:15] stuck in this trying to talk about
[13:18] they're talking about what's happened
[13:20] what are they doing talking about it
[13:22] they're trying to understand what's
[13:24] happened
[13:25] why is he now gone we thought surely
[13:28] he was the one that would deliver israel
[13:31] and he had just delivered israel
[13:34] hallelujah and then they're they're
[13:37] talking
[13:37] what is this with these sisters that
[13:39] have gone and seen a vision of
[13:41] angels what do you suppose they saw and
[13:44] and they're not even
[13:45] they're not even reciting what the angel
[13:47] said because they're not even convinced
[13:48] that it was angels
[13:51] it must have been a vision of angels and
[13:54] so now
[13:54] they're caught in this human reasoning
[13:57] trying to by their mind decipher what's
[14:00] been happening to them and
[14:01] and why we're in this situation and what
[14:04] should we do and it's not what i
[14:06] thought it's not happening the way i
[14:07] thought it would happen i
[14:09] don't understand the circumstances we're
[14:11] in i'm not clear
[14:13] what's happening and jesus shows up on
[14:15] the scene
[14:16] and he's standing there talking to them
[14:17] but because they don't see the
[14:19] scriptures
[14:20] they're not looking for him
[14:24] because they don't know the word they're
[14:26] not even looking for him
[14:28] because their mind is on portions of the
[14:31] word but they don't see the whole word
[14:33] and so now when he shows up to come and
[14:35] walk with them
[14:36] on their road to emmaus they don't even
[14:38] know this is the lord
[14:40] and what has blinded them their failure
[14:42] to know the scriptures
[14:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[14:53] his old fools and slow of heart to
[14:55] believe all
[14:56] the prophets have spoken
[14:59] not christ to have suffered these things
[15:01] and to enter into his glory
[15:03] and beginning at moses
[15:07] and all the prophets
[15:10] oh he didn't just take him to a few key
[15:13] verses
[15:14] he didn't just show them a couple of
[15:16] things
[15:17] he was showing them the entire bible at
[15:20] that time
[15:23] right what was the bible the law and the
[15:26] prophets the law and the prophets you
[15:27] heard them say all the time does not the
[15:28] law and the prophets say
[15:29] what is the law and the prophets it's
[15:31] the entire bible that they had at this
[15:34] time
[15:34] so jesus begins at moses what is moses
[15:38] the beginning
[15:39] and he goes to moses all the way through
[15:41] their bible
[15:42] from the beginning to the end and he
[15:44] just explains
[15:46] himself
[15:49] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[15:51] he's right here giving them the book of
[15:54] revelation amen
[15:55] hallelujah and he's explaining on the
[15:58] road to emmaus
[15:59] he's condemning them he's challenging
[16:02] them because they've missed the
[16:03] scriptures
[16:04] and beginning at moses amen and all the
[16:07] prophets
[16:10] you say really i mean did he really what
[16:12] about haggai i mean that's like that
[16:14] long you know i mean what did he find
[16:15] there
[16:16] all the prophets
[16:20] hallelujah he began to
[16:23] he began to show them the scriptures
[16:26] concerning himself
[16:30] now listen in the beginning he said
[16:32] verse 27 and
[16:33] and beginning at moses and all the
[16:34] prophets he expounded unto them
[16:37] all the scriptures the things concerning
[16:39] himself
[16:41] i tell you all the prophets and all the
[16:44] scriptures
[16:46] concerned himself amen
[16:49] what is this book what is this that we
[16:52] read
[16:54] all the all the prophets
[16:57] all the psalms all the proverbs
[17:01] all the gospels all the epistles it is
[17:04] all concerning him
[17:08] hallelujah
[17:11] hallelujah brother branham said in the
[17:14] statue of a perfect man he said last
[17:15] night i preached on the key
[17:17] and the key is faith and faith holds the
[17:19] key and the key is the scripture
[17:21] and christ is the door so faith takes
[17:24] the little hinges of the scripture and
[17:25] unlocks the glories and the good of god
[17:27] out to his people
[17:28] so it's faith holds the key that unlocks
[17:30] christ to the people
[17:32] unlocks it and reveals it brother venom
[17:35] said
[17:35] we see him by faith we believe by faith
[17:38] but faith must be based on something he
[17:40] said faith is just not
[17:41] laying out there on nothing with no
[17:43] foundation but our faith is anchored and
[17:45] attached to something
[17:47] and it's attached to this word this is
[17:50] what our faith is attached to
[17:51] and when we can find it in the word and
[17:53] it's quickened by faith in our heart
[17:55] then we can have whatsoever we ask for
[17:59] hallelujah brother branham said
[18:02] in the message revelation chapter 5 he
[18:05] said now this book has
[18:06] was sealed with seven seals it was the
[18:09] bible
[18:10] and it was sealed with seven seals and
[18:12] brother brahm talks about this again
[18:14] in in the seven in the message the seven
[18:17] seals when he's preaching the seven
[18:18] seals
[18:19] he says uh he says now this book of
[18:22] redemption is the bible
[18:25] and we find it the whole revelation of
[18:28] it
[18:28] is wound up in these seven seals he said
[18:31] they sealed the mystery of the whole
[18:33] book
[18:35] so when brother branham comes along and
[18:37] now god
[18:38] calls him to come back after being
[18:40] caught up in a constellation of
[18:42] angels comes back to preach the seven
[18:44] seal mystery
[18:45] he's preaching to seven thunders which
[18:47] is the thing that was not even written
[18:49] out when
[18:49] when john heard it he began to write it
[18:52] out remember we preached this the sunday
[18:53] before i left
[18:54] john began to write it out when john saw
[18:57] the lamb
[18:58] take the book and open the seals john
[19:00] saw what it was and he wrote it out
[19:02] white horse and a bow in his hand crown
[19:05] was given to him
[19:06] he's writing it out and now he comes
[19:09] over
[19:09] for the time of the revelation in
[19:11] revelations 10
[19:12] to reveal the mysteries or the mystery
[19:16] of the symbols
[19:17] he was going to get the the mystery of
[19:19] what those symbols meant
[19:20] what is a white horse what is the bow
[19:23] what is the crown
[19:24] and it's given in seven thunders and
[19:26] john hears it and john knows it and
[19:28] john's about to write it down
[19:30] and the angel says seal up those things
[19:32] that were written until the time of the
[19:34] end
[19:37] same thing daniel saw but daniel was
[19:39] told to seal it up to the time of the
[19:41] end
[19:41] then at the time of the end there come a
[19:43] prophet on the scene
[19:44] and he preached those seven thunders
[19:47] that john saw and didn't write
[19:51] what were those seven thunders he said
[19:53] this whole bible
[19:54] is sealed up with them seven seals so
[19:57] when brother branham comes
[19:58] and god through him is preaching the
[20:00] seven seals he is preaching the entire
[20:04] bible
[20:07] well you said well he didn't read every
[20:08] verse i mean he didn't read the whole
[20:10] thing that would have taken him three
[20:11] weeks four weeks
[20:12] five weeks not one week he preached the
[20:15] mystery
[20:16] of the whole bible it was locked in a
[20:20] mystery
[20:21] away from the understanding of man and
[20:23] that mystery was wound up in them seven
[20:25] seals
[20:26] and at the unveiling of them seven seals
[20:28] the mystery of god was finished
[20:31] what is the mystery of god this is the
[20:33] mystery of god
[20:36] not just this it's so much more but the
[20:38] mystery of god is written out here
[20:41] in 66 books in the bible amen but it was
[20:44] hidden from her eyes
[20:45] it was withholding our eyes were
[20:47] withholding to where we could not see
[20:49] the whole redemption plan
[20:51] we could not see all the things that we
[20:53] now see and understand amen
[20:56] but when the seals came off of that book
[20:58] he's revealing the whole bible
[21:04] that's why brother branham before he
[21:06] gets to the seals
[21:08] he's talking about when we get to the
[21:09] seals when we get to them seals
[21:12] when we get to the seals after he
[21:14] preaches the seals he's always pointing
[21:16] back them seals
[21:18] back in them seals what's he talking
[21:20] about
[21:21] the seals unlocked something there was
[21:23] something locked up there
[21:25] that was unlocked and now what is it
[21:28] it's the mystery of god
[21:29] it's the full revelation of the full
[21:32] word
[21:32] is known in the seven seals
[21:37] i think we need to pay a little more
[21:38] attention to the seals
[21:43] now i want to i want to take just one
[21:46] aspect of this
[21:47] and look at just one small part because
[21:49] this is something i want to labor on for
[21:51] a long time
[21:51] and i'm hoping the lord will just keep
[21:53] opening things up to me so that we can
[21:55] keep going down this path
[21:56] so please be praying be praying for us
[21:59] but i really want to take
[22:00] one one slice and one snapshot and i
[22:03] really want the ministering brothers
[22:05] very carefully to pay attention to what
[22:07] i'm saying
[22:07] because i i want you to help me break
[22:09] this down to the people and i want to
[22:11] take just one
[22:12] sliver and look at that and then we'll
[22:13] keep looking at other things
[22:15] but i want to look at the seventh seal
[22:17] revealed in the sixth
[22:20] because six reveals the seventh all
[22:22] through the bible
[22:23] and and i don't want to send you for a
[22:25] loop just hear what i'm saying we're
[22:26] going to look at this and we're going to
[22:27] find it in the scriptures
[22:29] but the sixth reveals the seventh every
[22:31] time
[22:33] amen brother branham in the fifth seal
[22:36] he's referring
[22:37] back to sir is this the time is what he
[22:40] calls it
[22:41] it's it's labeled is this the sign of
[22:43] the in sir
[22:44] and he's talking about this message and
[22:45] in this message he's
[22:47] he's had six people come to him and give
[22:49] him dreams
[22:50] right in a row he said with nothing in
[22:52] between and all these dreams are
[22:54] speaking
[22:54] the same thing they're all talking about
[22:56] the same thing and it all has to do with
[22:58] the opening of the seals
[22:59] and so he gets these six dreams and then
[23:01] he says then i'm in my room that day and
[23:04] there's a vision amen
[23:05] and then he's reminded of what he must
[23:07] do he must go
[23:08] back because there was a vision that
[23:10] laid before that told him when these
[23:12] things happen
[23:13] when they go to the tear out your stone
[23:15] fence when these things happen go west
[23:17] for the revealing of the seven seals so
[23:20] now
[23:21] he says in the fifth seal he's referring
[23:23] to that he said if you just know what
[23:24] happened what happened before we left
[23:26] here you understand
[23:27] why six straight dreams come exactly
[23:30] with the vision amen
[23:32] amen and then in the sir in the sign of
[23:36] is this the sign of the answer he said
[23:38] six straight dreams
[23:40] and then the vision capped it so he's
[23:43] always talking about this pyramid right
[23:45] because his brother branham's got this
[23:46] vision and he's never getting away from
[23:48] it
[23:48] he says six straight dreams and then the
[23:51] vision captain
[23:52] so we find out that the six were
[23:54] revealing the seventh
[23:56] because the six dreams were revealing
[23:59] the seventh
[24:00] they were telling him what's going to be
[24:01] the capstone it's the capstone of his
[24:03] ministry it's the seven thunders
[24:06] he's going out west to get the
[24:08] revelation of the seven thunders and the
[24:09] six
[24:10] dreams reveal the seventh
[24:13] now remember the seventh is always a
[24:15] mystery
[24:17] never spoken it's always a mystery in
[24:20] the scriptures you go through six seals
[24:22] when you get to the seventh it says
[24:23] there's silence in heaven for the space
[24:24] of half an hour
[24:25] nothing is told not even a symbol
[24:27] written there's never anything
[24:29] and at the revelation of the seventh
[24:31] seal brother branham said that's
[24:32] revelations 10
[24:33] 1-7 and when we come to the revelation
[24:35] of the seventh seal
[24:37] now there's seven thunders and john's
[24:39] told not to write it's a mystery again
[24:41] nothing's written
[24:43] so brother branham's coming to he has
[24:44] this mystery in his life
[24:46] and this mystery in his life he knows is
[24:48] attached to the seals
[24:50] he knows malachi 4 and revelation 10
[24:53] 7 are attached he knows this
[24:56] he knows they're linked together he
[24:58] knows it has something to do with his
[25:00] ministry
[25:01] he knows he's moving towards it he's
[25:02] looking at it and he knows this is
[25:04] coming
[25:05] but it's a mystery in his life a
[25:07] constant mystery in his life
[25:08] but the six dreams revealed the
[25:13] it's mystery it's time to go
[25:16] you know in and and i love junior
[25:18] jackson's dream in junior jackson's
[25:19] dream there's a pyramid
[25:21] and the pyramid has writing all over the
[25:23] outside of it right
[25:24] and and that's the seals and symbol form
[25:27] that's the seals that are being preached
[25:28] amen
[25:29] before the before the thunders but in
[25:31] the capstone there has to be something
[25:34] and brother branham grabs an instrument
[25:35] and he rips the cap off and inside there
[25:38] is white stone that's never been written
[25:40] on before
[25:42] and before this brother branham had been
[25:43] going around the pyramid interpreting
[25:45] all the writing on the outside of the
[25:47] pyramid
[25:47] because brother branham had already
[25:49] preached the church ages amen
[25:50] he preached revelations chapter 5. he's
[25:53] preached all of these things
[25:54] but he gets up to the seals in 1961 in
[25:57] 1960 he preaches the first
[25:59] first four chapters first three chapters
[26:02] goes into the fourth chapter
[26:03] and then in 1961 he goes into the fifth
[26:06] chapter revelations chapter five
[26:08] and he stops and he stands still and he
[26:11] does not move
[26:12] forward until now these six dreams
[26:15] capped by the vision move him forward
[26:18] because what is it
[26:19] he's been on the outside of the pyramid
[26:20] interpreting the writing on the outside
[26:22] of the pyramid
[26:24] he's been talking all about it but now
[26:26] it's time for the seven thunders
[26:28] and he rips the cap off and in the cap
[26:31] is
[26:31] is the is the unwritten stone he said
[26:34] light has never shined on this
[26:36] before
[26:41] hallelujah this was
[26:44] more i'm telling you this was so much
[26:47] more
[26:47] than somebody talking about the church
[26:49] ages again and souls under the altar
[26:52] and tribulation this was so much more
[26:54] than that
[26:55] we can catch the information of the
[26:57] sequence of events in the timeline
[26:59] and we can miss the whole thing
[27:04] in the sixth deal brother brennam says
[27:05] now remember these are hidden mysteries
[27:08] and the sixth seal altogether is one
[27:11] great big
[27:12] book just six scrolls rolled together
[27:15] and it unwinds the whole book of
[27:16] redemption
[27:18] now did you just catch that brother
[27:19] brandon didn't say seven seals unwinds
[27:21] the whole book of redemption
[27:23] he said six seals six scrolls
[27:26] rolled together and it unwinds the whole
[27:29] book of redemption
[27:31] where's the seventh where's the seventh
[27:36] he's in the sixth year he's talking
[27:37] about the sixtieth all together is one
[27:40] great big book just six scrolls rolled
[27:43] together
[27:44] and it unwinds the whole book of
[27:46] redemption that's how the whole
[27:48] earth was redeemed so now we find out
[27:51] that this is exactly matching what he
[27:53] did when he preached the seven seals
[27:55] because brother branham came every day
[27:57] and got a revelation from the angel and
[27:58] he would show up and he would tell you
[28:00] this means this and this means that and
[28:02] you find it in the scripture here
[28:04] and he's revealing all the way down
[28:05] through the sixth day but when he gets
[28:07] to the seventh
[28:08] he doesn't tell you anything and he
[28:11] talks and
[28:12] hems all around and he tells some
[28:14] stories and he gives he's poking at it
[28:16] and he wants you to see some things
[28:17] and he's talking about the sword in the
[28:19] hand and sabino cannon
[28:21] and all of these things and then he says
[28:23] i have a no he says stop right here
[28:26] why because he's a word prophet and he
[28:29] has to exactly match the word
[28:32] amen because when jesus christ was on
[28:35] earth in matthew 24
[28:36] they asked him when will these things be
[28:38] what will be the sign that are coming in
[28:40] the time of the end they ask these
[28:41] questions
[28:42] and brother branham tells us he points
[28:44] us back to jesus christ
[28:46] in matthew 24 he tells all six seals
[28:50] but he omits the seventh
[28:53] here he comes amen in 1963
[28:56] and he gives all six seals and his note
[29:00] says
[29:00] stop right here say no more he omits the
[29:03] seventh
[29:04] why his life is exactly paralleling the
[29:07] scriptures
[29:08] this prophet is not doing anything
[29:09] outside the word he's walking right in
[29:12] step with the word
[29:16] so he says the six scrolls together
[29:20] it unwinds the whole book of revel whole
[29:22] book of redemption
[29:23] because it did unwind the whole book of
[29:25] redemption
[29:26] because the six revealed the seventh
[29:28] because the seventh was a mystery
[29:30] and brother banham said do you see have
[29:33] you noticed
[29:34] what's been happening the mysterious
[29:36] part of these meetings all this week
[29:39] and he says i know you don't see it
[29:41] you're not getting it
[29:42] you're not supposed to get it hallelujah
[29:46] why because it's matching it's
[29:48] paralleling the scriptures
[29:50] and what he's trying to show us is the
[29:52] sixth has revealed the seventh
[29:56] the sixth has revealed the seventh
[30:00] in future home of the heavenly
[30:02] bridegroom and the earthly bride
[30:03] brother brandon said you think that
[30:05] little noise out here in tucson was
[30:06] something
[30:07] when he opened up the six seals that
[30:10] shook the country around about
[30:12] and caught and caused the talk
[30:15] i thought he opened the seven seals
[30:18] amen he says when he opened the six
[30:21] seals
[30:23] why because there's a mystery to the
[30:25] seventh
[30:27] and it comes by revelation
[30:32] in the seventh seal brother roman says
[30:34] now notice now the end of time
[30:36] message this seal after all he's
[30:38] revealed all the six seals
[30:40] but it don't say nothing about the
[30:42] seventh and the end time
[30:43] seal when it starts will be absolutely a
[30:46] total secret according to the bible
[30:49] before knowing that remember between
[30:51] revelation 10
[30:52] 1-7 at the end of the seven angels
[30:54] message all the mysteries of god will be
[30:57] known
[30:57] were at the end time the opening of the
[30:59] seventh seal
[31:01] now the eighth chapter only reveals the
[31:03] scene
[31:05] the scene of the seventh seal where
[31:06] nothing else is revealed
[31:08] nothing is not revealed in the seventh
[31:10] seal further down says the seventh seal
[31:13] is spoke of from the very beginning in
[31:16] genesis
[31:18] amen these seals move right up
[31:22] could you remember this morning bringing
[31:23] these things up and watch tonight bring
[31:25] them up and you find out
[31:27] when it gets to the seventh seal she
[31:29] cuts off jesus christ is speaking
[31:31] himself
[31:32] told of the end time and when he got he
[31:34] told all six seals
[31:35] when he got to the seventh he stopped
[31:38] there it is
[31:40] there's what
[31:44] you see he's matching the scriptures
[31:46] he's got to preach it the way the
[31:48] scriptures say
[31:49] amen and then brother brennan preached
[31:51] the seventh seal you
[31:52] you better believe he preached the
[31:54] seventh seal is the seventh seal open
[31:56] absolutely the seventh seal opened but
[31:58] he revealed it in the six
[32:01] he said look at the mysterious thing
[32:02] that's been going on all week
[32:04] those angels come to me one by one amen
[32:07] and he starts talking about seven
[32:08] thunders
[32:09] seven thunders thundering out all in a
[32:11] row like they're spelling out something
[32:16] because the six reveals the seventh
[32:20] hallelujah
[32:24] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[32:27] he says now god had a purpose and a
[32:29] hidden mystery
[32:30] and that's what i want to speak on to
[32:32] the church this morning the hidden
[32:33] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[32:35] before the world ever began
[32:37] and how that it's unfolded itself right
[32:39] down to this present hour that we're
[32:40] living
[32:41] then you will understand clearly then
[32:43] you see on i believe
[32:45] what is being done god's great mystery
[32:48] of how it's a
[32:49] secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed
[32:52] anything about it even the angels didn't
[32:54] understand it
[32:54] what's he talking about the seventh seal
[32:57] the coming of the lord
[32:59] the revelation of jesus christ
[33:05] that's the reason under those seven
[33:06] mysteries when the seventh seal was
[33:08] opened there was silence
[33:09] jesus when he was on earth they wanted
[33:11] to know when he would come
[33:13] he said even the son himself don't know
[33:15] when it's going to happen see
[33:16] god has this all to himself it's a
[33:19] secret
[33:20] and that's the reason there was silence
[33:22] in heaven for the space of half an hour
[33:24] and seven thunders uttered their voices
[33:26] and john was even forbidden to write it
[33:28] see
[33:28] the coming of the lord that's one thing
[33:31] he hasn't revealed yet
[33:32] of how he will come and when he will
[33:34] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[33:37] know he has showed or revealed it in
[33:40] every type that's in the bible
[33:44] because them seven seals are sealed up
[33:47] the mystery of the bible
[33:49] this bible this book of redemption is
[33:51] the mysteries of it is sealed up in
[33:53] seven seals
[33:54] and when the seven seals peeled off it
[33:56] showed us the whole bible
[33:58] and that's why brother branham comes to
[33:59] christ as the mystery of god revealed
[34:01] and he says now
[34:02] he showed it in every type that's in the
[34:05] bible
[34:08] give me eyesafe god oh don't let my eyes
[34:11] be holding that i cannot see
[34:13] that you're walking with us today we're
[34:16] on the road to emmaus amen things have
[34:18] happened
[34:19] and we're recognizing by the scriptures
[34:21] but i want to see you're right here
[34:23] you're right here in our midst and
[34:25] you're breaking down to us the
[34:26] scriptures
[34:28] you're breaking the bread of life and
[34:30] we're seeing who this
[34:31] is hallelujah
[34:35] he showed or revealed it in every type
[34:37] that's in the bible
[34:38] he didn't say most types
[34:42] what's brother branham doing brother
[34:44] branham is repeating the road to emmaus
[34:47] he comes to christ as the mystery of god
[34:49] revealed and he's repeating the road to
[34:51] emmaus
[34:52] now watch what he says he showed or
[34:55] revealed in every type that's in the
[34:56] bible
[34:57] when jesus came after his death after
[35:00] his resurrection
[35:01] he's come back to them now after he's
[35:03] paid the price for redemption
[35:04] and he's come back to them and now amen
[35:07] their eyes are holding they don't even
[35:09] know what's happening
[35:10] and he begins to speak to them all
[35:13] the prophets starting at moses
[35:17] in all the prophets
[35:21] every type that was in the bible was
[35:24] speaking of him
[35:26] and here he comes at his resurrection
[35:28] and now brother branham comes
[35:30] and mis and after the seals and christ
[35:32] is the mystery of god revealed
[35:33] and he's repeating the road to emmaus
[35:36] because everything he does is in the
[35:38] scriptures that's why
[35:40] when jesus hallelujah when jesus in
[35:43] matthew
[35:44] and yeah in matthew 24 i believe it is
[35:48] he's going through and he and they're
[35:49] asking him the questions and he's giving
[35:50] them the six seals
[35:52] but when he gets to the seventh seal he
[35:54] doesn't tell him anything
[35:56] but after his resurrection when
[35:58] redemption is done
[35:59] amen when he's paid the price now he
[36:02] comes back and their eyes are holding
[36:03] and he begins to teach them all that the
[36:06] prophet said
[36:07] he starts at moses and he goes through
[36:09] all of the prophets
[36:10] amen what's he doing he's preaching
[36:12] christ as the mystery of god revealed
[36:17] hallelujah oh something thrills my soul
[36:21] when we see that this is firmly
[36:23] entrenched in the scriptures
[36:25] this isn't the ideas of a man brother
[36:27] branham is just walking and led by the
[36:29] holy spirit
[36:30] thinks i'll do this and i'll try to do
[36:31] this and it doesn't work out and i do
[36:33] this
[36:33] what's god doing he's making the pattern
[36:36] he's the pattern once god sets the
[36:37] pattern
[36:38] it always sticks with the same pattern
[36:41] and brother branham's walking in the
[36:42] pattern and he doesn't even know
[36:44] that i can't do this and i'm going to do
[36:46] this and it won't work out for that
[36:48] and i'm waiting on this what's he doing
[36:49] god is forcing him to walk in the
[36:51] pattern
[36:52] that he established when he was here the
[36:54] first time
[36:58] that's why he comes and he doesn't
[37:00] preach the seventh seal
[37:02] amen he doesn't preach the seventh seal
[37:04] when he preaches the seven seals he
[37:06] preaches the seventh seal on the road to
[37:08] emmaus and christ is the mystery of god
[37:09] revealed
[37:10] why does he come later to do it because
[37:12] jesus did it later
[37:18] it's got to follow the pattern it always
[37:21] has the scriptures has to stay
[37:23] true and you got to remember that this
[37:26] word that we're reading
[37:27] is jesus christ right
[37:30] that's john 1 1 amen it's telling us
[37:33] that this is jesus christ
[37:35] this is the son of god in print form i'm
[37:38] reading this
[37:38] amen this is not
[37:42] some people's ideas this is the word of
[37:44] god now if jesus christ we know
[37:46] hebrews 13 8 was a theme of brother
[37:49] branham through his whole ministry
[37:51] and the theme is jesus christ the same
[37:53] yesterday
[37:54] today and forever and that makes every
[37:57] single word in this bible
[37:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[38:02] and that's why brother branham coming
[38:04] being a word prophet he could not do
[38:06] one thing out of step with the pattern
[38:08] that's laid in the scriptures
[38:10] because this scripture was not written
[38:12] for jesus day
[38:13] when he's on the road to emmaus he
[38:15] didn't write that for his day
[38:17] he wrote that for our day
[38:21] if you put this bible anywhere else but
[38:24] today
[38:25] and i'm talking every scripture every
[38:27] line every verse
[38:29] if you put it off to the jews or you put
[38:31] it off in the psalms or you put it off
[38:33] to the corinthians
[38:34] you have missed the mystery of god
[38:37] then you do not even know what the
[38:38] seventh seal is
[38:43] don't tell me old testament new
[38:45] testament that was for the jews
[38:47] or that was for the babylonian that was
[38:50] for the exile to babylon
[38:51] that's about me if you don't see jesus
[38:55] christ in
[38:56] every line in the bible you go back and
[38:58] read it again for you missed something
[39:00] and this seventh seal has been shown in
[39:02] every type that's in the bible
[39:04] don't don't talk to me about that was
[39:06] for another day
[39:08] every word is eternal
[39:10] [Applause]
[39:12] don't put it somewhere else you bring it
[39:15] right today
[39:16] and this word is eternal and it's being
[39:18] fleshed out again
[39:19] and again and again and again he set the
[39:22] pattern in genesis chapter one
[39:24] and he's never deviated from the pattern
[39:26] in genesis chapter
[39:28] one genesis chapter one is still
[39:32] happening today he laid a pattern
[39:36] and the pattern is continuing to move on
[39:44] this is so much more than even human
[39:45] lips can say
[39:47] i could stand here from now till this
[39:49] time tomorrow and not even scratch the
[39:50] surface of what i'm talking about
[39:54] hallelujah and christ is the mystery of
[39:57] god revealed he is showed or revealed in
[39:59] every type that's in the bible
[40:00] therefore the entire bible is the
[40:02] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[40:06] do we believe that well you can't say
[40:09] well that was david
[40:12] amen you can't say well that was the
[40:14] kings
[40:15] you can't say that was the judges amen
[40:19] if so you've missed christ
[40:23] the entire bible is an expression of one
[40:25] goal that god had
[40:27] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[40:29] entire bible
[40:30] and the acts of the believers in the
[40:32] bible has been in type
[40:33] in expressing what god's great goal is
[40:36] and now
[40:36] in this last day he has revealed it and
[40:40] shows it
[40:45] let's go to revelations chapter 10.
[40:50] we want this to drive down into your
[40:52] souls
[40:53] and right now your mind might be
[40:55] spinning let it spin it has nothing to
[40:57] do with your brain
[40:59] this has nothing to do with your
[41:00] intellect or your reasoning
[41:02] or your ability to understand i am
[41:04] preaching to your soul
[41:06] and that is exactly the way jesus christ
[41:08] preached when he was here on earth
[41:10] because when jesus was here every time
[41:12] they asked him a question
[41:13] he never answered their question he gave
[41:16] him more truth
[41:18] he comes to the woman at the well and
[41:20] then the woman at the well
[41:22] he says get me a drink and she says well
[41:24] you know there's customs and you know
[41:25] we're not supposed to do these things
[41:27] and he says if you knew who i were you
[41:28] would ask me of a drink that you would
[41:29] never come here you never thirst again
[41:32] and immediately this this woman's story
[41:35] in john chapter 4 is my story
[41:37] it's your story this is exactly the same
[41:39] we came to the lord
[41:40] amen he come by our way and he says a
[41:42] little something
[41:43] and immediately she reasons it
[41:47] and we did the same thing how can this
[41:49] be i've never heard this before
[41:51] one man prophet for the whole world i
[41:52] where's that in the bible
[41:54] i mean what about all these other
[41:55] churches what about all these other
[41:56] people who confess jesus
[41:58] mental reasoning and she says how
[42:02] how are you going to get this water i
[42:04] mean the well's deep and you don't have
[42:05] anything to draw with
[42:07] she goes instantly to reasoning
[42:10] how are you going to do that and jesus
[42:12] never even
[42:13] flinches at the question never even acts
[42:16] like she said a word
[42:18] amen he said the water that i give
[42:23] because god doesn't answer reasoning it
[42:26] has nothing to do with reasoning
[42:28] god is not trying to get an intellectual
[42:30] understanding to this woman
[42:32] he's trying to bring a revelation that
[42:33] comes from the soul and he ignores her
[42:36] reasoning
[42:36] he ignores her question that's where the
[42:39] bride makes a mistake today
[42:40] trying to get on the grounds of
[42:42] reasoning and answering all the
[42:43] questions
[42:44] i say you you want me to answer that
[42:46] question answer me a question
[42:48] that's what jesus said who was john
[42:54] amen we don't have to answer the devil's
[42:57] questions we don't have
[42:58] to follow the path of the mind we can
[43:00] bypass the mind and go right to the soul
[43:03] and if there's a seed of god in there
[43:05] it's not about answering the questions
[43:07] it's about giving the truth
[43:08] giving the word because that's what
[43:10] awakens the soul and now she's there and
[43:12] said how
[43:13] the well is deep you have nothing to
[43:15] draw with he says the water that i give
[43:20] shall be a well of water springing up
[43:22] into eternal life
[43:24] now here's a woman who asked a very
[43:26] reasonable question
[43:28] and she got a very ridiculous answer
[43:32] and this just shows that it has nothing
[43:34] to do with your mind
[43:36] because this woman had a legitimate
[43:38] reasonable question
[43:39] that the lord completely ignored
[43:43] and then he says then this water that i
[43:45] give will be in them a well of
[43:47] and she says give me that water
[43:50] this is the most unreasonable
[43:52] conversation that i've ever read
[43:54] but this is coming right out of the
[43:55] bible this is my story this is your
[43:57] story
[43:58] before he answered the questions before
[44:00] reasoning was ever suffice
[44:02] he said something else came off the lips
[44:04] of a prophet we read something else out
[44:06] of our bible
[44:07] and all of a sudden we said i want this
[44:09] life
[44:10] i want this water we didn't even know
[44:12] what we were talking about
[44:14] we hardly knew what we were asking for
[44:16] but that was a response of the soul
[44:19] crying out for the living water not for
[44:22] reasoning and understanding and mental
[44:24] conceptions
[44:25] that will bring failure and death every
[44:28] time
[44:29] if jesus would have stood there and says
[44:31] well see you have to understand
[44:32] there's a natural spiritual type and i'm
[44:34] saying he never went through any of that
[44:36] stuff
[44:38] he just went right to the soul
[44:42] he did the same thing to the rich young
[44:44] rule and the rich young ruler turned
[44:46] around and walked away
[44:48] but this woman didn't walk away she said
[44:50] give me that water
[44:53] amen and then jesus does something else
[44:55] that's a little ridiculous
[44:57] he just said i've got water come to me
[44:59] and drink if you drink your eternal life
[45:01] and she now accepts the offer give me
[45:02] the water he says okay go get your
[45:04] husband
[45:09] this is the same way the prophet
[45:11] preaches
[45:12] amen he'll be saying something then he
[45:14] goes off and says something else
[45:16] then he comes back and it's all tying
[45:18] together
[45:20] hallelujah he's telling stories and
[45:22] these aren't stories these are parables
[45:26] he's talking about we were over hunting
[45:28] and this and that and he's telling you
[45:30] what he's preaching about
[45:32] it and we breathe right over it to get
[45:34] to something else because we want to get
[45:36] to the meat of the word
[45:37] and he's giving you the parable that is
[45:39] explaining the whole thing
[45:40] before he preaches the seals he preaches
[45:43] christ in simplicity god hiding himself
[45:45] in simplicity
[45:46] and he comes out he says i'm sorry i'm a
[45:47] teeny bit late i had to bury
[45:49] a marry a couple before i came in
[45:56] and then the next thing he does is
[45:58] dedicate a church
[46:01] he's showing you what he's going to be
[46:03] doing this week this is what this week
[46:05] is all about
[46:06] i'm marrying a couple i'm marrying
[46:08] christ to the bride and i'm dedicating a
[46:10] church for service
[46:12] amen but we got to drop the reasoning
[46:15] and we got to let the soul grab
[46:16] a hold of this word and the brother
[46:18] branham is teaching the same way jesus
[46:20] taught
[46:22] hallelujah his life is matching the
[46:24] scriptures
[46:26] we've got to drop all of this reasoning
[46:29] taken the word and said god give me isaf
[46:33] let me see you breaking bread and my
[46:35] eyes will be open
[46:37] and i can see it's been you all along
[46:40] talking with me as we walk along the way
[46:43] that's what brother branham was trying
[46:44] to show him and christ is the mystery of
[46:46] god revealed
[46:47] he's saying you know this isn't me i'm
[46:49] just a microphone
[46:50] i'm just a mute i'm like a trumpet
[46:52] laying there i mean in the seventh seal
[46:54] he's saying you could have a line of
[46:55] trumpets and nothing can happen unless a
[46:57] man's blowing into the trumpet
[47:00] he's trying to show you this isn't me
[47:03] this isn't a man
[47:04] he said william branham's got nothing
[47:06] more to do with this than anything
[47:08] he's trying to show you this has been
[47:10] the road to emmaus
[47:11] these last years of the ministry it's
[47:14] been the road to emmaus are you seeing
[47:16] it
[47:18] hallelujah
[47:23] brother madam says in christ's mystery
[47:25] god revealed further down
[47:29] he said god has one purpose he wanted to
[47:32] achieve in the entire bible
[47:34] and all the acts of the believers in the
[47:35] bible has been in type and expressing
[47:37] what god's great goal is
[47:38] and now in this last day he's revealed
[47:41] it and shows it
[47:42] and god's help well you'll see it right
[47:45] here
[47:45] this morning what the lord has had in
[47:48] his mind all along and has expressed him
[47:50] therefore you can see the great meaning
[47:52] of what it has been to know this
[47:54] and then try to bring it to the people
[47:56] and then you don't i haven't went into
[47:59] details
[48:00] to try to explain it as god has revealed
[48:02] it to me
[48:04] he wants you to see something friends
[48:10] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[48:12] again now i want you to turn to the book
[48:14] of colossians first chapter
[48:16] of colossians and then while we read
[48:18] this beginning with i want you
[48:20] when you go home read the entire chapter
[48:22] colossians but i want you to read this
[48:23] morning with me
[48:24] from 15th to the 29th verse let's go
[48:26] there ourselves
[48:27] actually we were supposed to go to
[48:29] revelations weren't we
[48:31] let's go to revelation 7 first because i
[48:34] want to drill this in and then we'll
[48:35] move
[48:38] but in the days of the voice of the
[48:40] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[48:42] sound
[48:43] the mystery of god now that word's not
[48:47] plural
[48:48] he's not talking about multiple
[48:49] mysteries even though under this lies
[48:51] multiple mysteries there are multiple
[48:53] mysteries
[48:54] but he's talking about when we get to
[48:56] this point in the plan of redemption and
[48:58] the redemption cycle
[48:59] when we get to this point in the days of
[49:02] the voices of the seventh angel when he
[49:03] shall begin to sound
[49:04] the mystery of god should be finished as
[49:08] he hath declared to his servants the
[49:09] prophets
[49:10] so there's coming a time that the
[49:12] mystery will be finished
[49:15] god won't be finished the word won't be
[49:17] finished the redemption plan won't be
[49:19] finished
[49:19] the war the the mystery will be finished
[49:24] but the mystery's not going to be
[49:25] finished to the whole world
[49:27] the mystery is going to be finished to
[49:28] the elected ones
[49:32] now let's go to colossians
[49:40] i tell you i love this word
[49:44] i keep praying god i sav that's what i
[49:47] must have as i said
[49:52] you know that the apostle paul read this
[49:54] bible
[49:56] he studied under gamalio
[50:00] he knew this word oh my he knew it
[50:03] forward and backward under the greatest
[50:04] teacher of them all
[50:05] he was a student that was stellar and
[50:07] raising in the ranks to the position
[50:09] where
[50:09] they knew him at the high priest office
[50:12] because he could go to them and get
[50:14] letters to go persecute he was a known
[50:16] entity he wasn't a stranger
[50:17] he wasn't a student in his first year he
[50:19] was one who had come up under gamaliel
[50:21] and we know gamalio had influence in the
[50:23] sanhedrin because he began to speak and
[50:25] say hey
[50:26] let's wait on this thing so he comes up
[50:29] and now he knows this word but but he
[50:31] knows this word so well
[50:33] that he doesn't even see the word when
[50:35] it's fleshed out
[50:37] he studied the bible he can quote it
[50:39] verbatim he knows where to find
[50:41] every book every every book of the bible
[50:44] what it says where to find it what
[50:46] prophet prompted
[50:47] prophesied what order it came in he
[50:49] probably even knew
[50:50] the genealogies and the dates and the
[50:52] times of the events
[50:55] but here you have jesus christ and a
[50:58] mini-member bride after pentecost
[51:00] and jesus christ on earth fulfilling the
[51:02] word that he had written
[51:04] amen and and paul so versed in the word
[51:07] he can't even see it
[51:10] so god comes to him and blinds him by a
[51:12] light
[51:13] and and he comes to jesus and jesus
[51:15] comes to him
[51:16] and says why paul are you persecuting me
[51:21] paul loved the word and he was
[51:23] persecuting the word
[51:27] he couldn't recognize it in these forms
[51:30] but it was exactly according to the
[51:32] scriptures he had studied
[51:34] he was there to witness stephen stoning
[51:37] he was there for all of these things
[51:39] that these events had taken place he was
[51:41] in the know
[51:41] he was now there in one of the chief
[51:43] persecutors of the early church
[51:45] and he was blind to the fact that i'm
[51:47] persecuting the word
[51:48] i am persecuting god i'm going against
[51:51] this thing made flesh
[51:53] until god until god opened his eyes
[51:58] and he saw he saw the lord and he says
[52:00] why persecutest thou me
[52:03] and you know instantly he was blinded
[52:08] praise the lord because the lord jesus
[52:12] and the pillar of fire
[52:14] could not show paul the word
[52:18] all that he could do was blind paul
[52:22] he said go into the city and it will be
[52:24] told thee what thou must do
[52:27] now here is the lord himself in the form
[52:30] of the pillar of fire
[52:32] the one who the whole word is about who
[52:34] wrote the whole word
[52:35] who created all things all things were
[52:37] made by him and for him and nothing was
[52:39] made without him
[52:40] and here he is and he knows all things
[52:41] and he's got it all right here
[52:43] and he won't even tell paul what he must
[52:46] do
[52:46] he smites paul blind because if you want
[52:49] to go to the pillar of fire
[52:51] the pillar of fire will smite you blind
[52:56] because it's a different dispensation
[52:58] now it's a different time
[53:00] now the pillar of fire will smite you
[53:01] blind so many people trying to go back
[53:03] to the pillar of fire back to the pillar
[53:05] of fire
[53:06] if you go back to that pillar of fire
[53:07] it'll smite you blind
[53:09] because now we stand in the book of acts
[53:12] we are now in the book of acts that's
[53:14] what the prophet told us
[53:16] we we were in that we are the the book
[53:18] of acts is the example church
[53:20] and we're being returned back to the
[53:21] example church and we're standing here
[53:24] in the book of acts and now in the book
[53:26] of acts you cannot go
[53:28] to the lord and the pillar of fire
[53:32] you cannot say lord you show me i don't
[53:34] want to listen to any man
[53:36] that didn't work for paul amen
[53:39] now the pillar of fire smites him blind
[53:42] and the
[53:42] only way that he can see is if a prophet
[53:46] comes and lays hands on him and opens
[53:48] his eyes
[53:48] and tells him what he must do
[53:53] it's got to come through the body
[53:57] right even the ethiopian eunuch an angel
[53:59] comes
[54:00] and he tells he tells it philip you go
[54:02] there i want you to go to the wilderness
[54:04] he knows there's appointment that's got
[54:05] to be made
[54:06] why couldn't the angel go to the eunuch
[54:10] because we're in the book of acts
[54:12] hallelujah
[54:13] the life has to come through the body
[54:15] now the word has to come through the
[54:17] body
[54:18] and now the ethiopian eunuch is reading
[54:20] amen
[54:21] and philip is told to draw alongside the
[54:24] chariot and they get here together
[54:26] and and he's talking and he hears him
[54:28] reading and he says do you understand
[54:29] what you're reading
[54:30] he said how can i let some man guide me
[54:35] and beginning at that scripture
[54:40] he preached unto him christ
[54:43] hallelujah beginning at that scripture
[54:46] and brothers and sisters
[54:47] it's not for a pillar of fire to do it
[54:50] amen it's not even for
[54:52] the prophet of the age to do it he's
[54:54] coming he's gone
[54:55] but now there is a source of life on the
[54:57] earth there is a fountain of living
[54:59] water
[55:00] and we are that fountain of living water
[55:02] to give out the word we're in the book
[55:04] of acts
[55:04] we are the church of the book of acts
[55:07] there is only one place to come and get
[55:09] the water of life
[55:10] and you have to get one of those
[55:11] believers amen that's been filled with
[55:13] the holy ghost that's become a fountain
[55:15] of living water
[55:20] hallelujah so now he begins
[55:25] to explain to him christ
[55:30] now he didn't have to take him from that
[55:33] verse to another one
[55:35] and say no no no let's not start there
[55:36] let's start in malachi 4.
[55:41] starting at that verse why
[55:44] because every verse is talking about
[55:46] christ
[55:49] we don't have to go to some specific
[55:50] verse we can begin
[55:53] at any verse and preach christ
[55:58] because he's the entire bible every
[56:00] character was him and type
[56:02] every story was speaking of him and all
[56:04] of moses and all of the prophets and all
[56:06] the psalms and all the proverbs
[56:08] it's all about him pick a verse
[56:11] and let's start talking about him
[56:14] hallelujah
[56:18] brother madam said in the in christ's
[56:21] mystery god revealed he said let's read
[56:23] colossians
[56:24] let's turn there ourselves and read
[56:25] colossians chapter 15.
[56:36] colossians chapter 1 verse 15 who is the
[56:38] image of the invisible god the firstborn
[56:40] of every creature
[56:41] for by him were all things created that
[56:43] are in heaven and that are in earth
[56:45] visible and invisible
[56:46] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[56:48] principalities or powers
[56:50] all things were created by him and for
[56:52] him and he's before
[56:53] all things and by him all things consist
[56:58] what does that make christ everything
[57:04] everything and he is before all things
[57:07] and by them all things consist
[57:09] and he is the head of the body the
[57:11] church who is the beginning
[57:12] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[57:14] things he might have
[57:15] the preeminence for it please the father
[57:17] that in him should all fullness dwell
[57:21] hallelujah let's go down to verse 25.
[57:26] whereof i am made a minister according
[57:28] to the dispensation of
[57:29] the dispensation of god which is given
[57:31] to me for you to fulfill the word of god
[57:34] even the mystery which has been hid from
[57:35] the ages and from generations but now is
[57:37] made manifest to his saints
[57:39] to whom god would make known what is the
[57:41] riches of the glory of this mystery
[57:43] among the gentiles
[57:44] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[57:50] book of acts where is he
[57:54] he's in his church
[57:58] so now now we have
[58:02] uh in colossians he says now there's
[58:05] this mystery that's been hid from
[58:06] generations and from ages
[58:08] what is this it's the same mystery that
[58:10] we're speaking out in revelations 10
[58:12] 7 the mystery of god and brother branham
[58:16] said he spoke of this
[58:17] all the way back in the beginning in
[58:19] genesis
[58:21] and the whole bible is telling the same
[58:23] thing what is this
[58:25] it's the mystery of christ he comes to
[58:28] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[58:29] and listen he tells the whole story in
[58:32] the title
[58:34] he reveals the whole bible in the title
[58:36] of this message
[58:38] he reveals the seventh seal and the
[58:40] title of this message
[58:42] he reveals your life in the title of
[58:45] this message
[58:47] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[58:54] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[58:56] angel when he shall begin to sound
[58:58] the mystery of god shall be revealed
[59:01] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[59:05] what's he telling you this is the
[59:07] seventh seal
[59:09] this is it what is it it's christ
[59:11] hallelujah
[59:14] and then he comes this opening scripture
[59:17] that brother branham brings his opening
[59:19] scripture and christ is the mystery of
[59:20] god revealed
[59:21] he goes to this passage that we just
[59:23] read this
[59:24] mystery that has been hid from ages and
[59:26] from generations but now is to be real
[59:29] christ in you the hope of glory
[59:32] what is this the seventh seal
[59:36] and you're part of it
[59:40] hallelujah
[59:44] brother brandon says read this 15th
[59:47] through the 29th verse
[59:48] it says and now just be as patient as
[59:50] you can for i feel that in this here
[59:52] if god will help me will reveal and
[59:54] bring into your mind all these
[59:55] other things that i have talked on
[59:57] through the days of the tabernacle
[59:59] why i have said what i have said why i
[1:00:01] have done what i have done
[1:00:02] this is why
[1:00:06] because because the prophet of god knows
[1:00:09] he's walking through the book of
[1:00:12] revelations
[1:00:14] amen 1959 he knows
[1:00:17] that there's a there's a change in his
[1:00:18] ministry coming he knows
[1:00:20] he's coming and and then he starts
[1:00:22] walking into this
[1:00:23] 1960 and he starts preaching the
[1:00:25] revelation of jesus christ
[1:00:27] he's walking through the first three
[1:00:29] chapters of the book of revelation
[1:00:32] but he's knowing he's going to get to
[1:00:34] the seventh seal
[1:00:36] hallelujah this he says he says that
[1:00:40] cloud
[1:00:41] that you saw up here that's the
[1:00:43] vindication
[1:00:44] of my ministry
[1:00:48] he gets to revelations 10 7 in the days
[1:00:51] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:00:52] he shall begin to sound
[1:00:54] now he recognizes that's his ministry
[1:00:56] and he ties that to malachi 4
[1:00:58] and he said this will bring the past the
[1:01:01] turning of the hearts of the children
[1:01:03] back to the fathers
[1:01:04] what is it the opening of the seals
[1:01:07] turns the hearts
[1:01:08] back to the faith of the fathers because
[1:01:10] the faith of the fathers was a
[1:01:12] quickening
[1:01:13] an awakening to the word
[1:01:16] and his whole bible was sealed up with
[1:01:18] seven seals
[1:01:23] but in christ is the mystery of god
[1:01:25] review he says now for a text
[1:01:27] now he just gave you the title christ is
[1:01:30] the mystery of god revealed
[1:01:31] he goes through colossians christ in you
[1:01:33] the hope of glory
[1:01:34] now he says for a text i want to take

[1:05:37] revealed to me
[1:05:39] just pray brothers and sisters just pray
[1:05:43] now god's secret mystery he had before
[1:05:46] the world began
[1:05:47] now back in the back part of god's mind
[1:05:49] there was something that he was trying
[1:05:51] and was going to achieve and he had a
[1:05:53] motive in doing it in order to let
[1:05:55] himself
[1:05:56] be expressed that's the whole bible
[1:06:01] that is christ the mystery of god
[1:06:03] revealed
[1:06:04] letting himself what was in the back
[1:06:05] part of his mind the mystery that he
[1:06:08] held in his mind
[1:06:09] is he wanted to let himself be expressed
[1:06:12] and that is christ
[1:06:15] the mystery in the mind of god expressed
[1:06:24] hallelujah praise god
[1:06:28] now i want to i want to focus in on the
[1:06:31] sixth revealing the seventh
[1:06:33] now in souls that are in prison now the
[1:06:35] prophet says now remember in that sixth
[1:06:37] seal
[1:06:37] were all seven trumpet sounds under that
[1:06:39] sixth seal when we get to that you'll
[1:06:41] see that
[1:06:42] every trumpet took place in the sixth
[1:06:44] seal
[1:06:45] the seven is always the mystery remember
[1:06:48] that when you read the bible
[1:06:50] the seven is always the mystery watch
[1:06:54] that seven
[1:06:55] that's the finish that was the coming of
[1:06:57] the lord heaven was quiet
[1:06:58] silent nobody moved because jesus said
[1:07:01] himself not even an
[1:07:02] angel of heaven knows when i will return
[1:07:04] i don't even know it myself
[1:07:06] what time the father is putting that in
[1:07:08] his mind
[1:07:09] god alone knows it the spirit said i
[1:07:12] didn't know it
[1:07:13] when it was revealed when that seventh
[1:07:15] trumpets are that seventh angel a seal
[1:07:17] was opened
[1:07:18] then there was silence in heaven see it
[1:07:20] wasn't give away what would take place
[1:07:22] but under the sixth seal where those
[1:07:24] seven trumpets opened
[1:07:26] remember under there we find out that
[1:07:29] the lamb came forth appeared on the
[1:07:30] scene
[1:07:31] he had left the mercy seat his work of
[1:07:33] redemption was finished and he came
[1:07:34] forth and took the book out of the right
[1:07:36] hand
[1:07:36] of him that sat upon the throne and time
[1:07:38] was no more
[1:07:39] when did he do this under the sixth seal
[1:07:43] because the six reveals the seventh
[1:07:46] hallelujah and immediately an angel
[1:07:49] appeared in the seventh chapter the
[1:07:51] tenth chapter and the seventh verse
[1:07:52] and the angel came down and swore that
[1:07:54] time was no longer when
[1:07:56] in the sixth seal hallelujah
[1:08:00] why because the whole book of redemption
[1:08:03] is revealed in the six seals
[1:08:05] why because the seventh seal isn't
[1:08:08] anything
[1:08:10] first seal is this and second seal and
[1:08:12] third seal
[1:08:13] but what's the seventh seal
[1:08:16] seven seal isn't anything the seven seal
[1:08:19] is a person
[1:08:22] it's all revealed in six seals because
[1:08:24] six seals telling you this types this
[1:08:26] and this is happening in this world
[1:08:27] event
[1:08:27] in the future event all in six seals
[1:08:29] revealing the whole mystery of
[1:08:31] redemption
[1:08:31] but the seventh seal is not revealing
[1:08:34] anything in the mystery of redemption
[1:08:36] the seventh seal is the revelation of
[1:08:38] the person of redemption
[1:08:40] remember the seventh seal is not a thing
[1:08:43] it's not an event necessarily
[1:08:45] it's a person
[1:08:49] that's why the six reveals the seventh
[1:08:53] because you would have never got the six
[1:08:55] without the presence of the seventh
[1:08:58] hallelujah go back to the book of ruth
[1:09:03] you go to the book of ruth the book of
[1:09:04] ruth takes ruth through the church ages
[1:09:06] the seals are in the book of ruth
[1:09:10] because here we find out that ruth is
[1:09:12] already
[1:09:13] she is already in the church ages
[1:09:16] they've come
[1:09:16] down through spiritual famine they've
[1:09:19] been they've left their land they should
[1:09:20] have never left the word
[1:09:23] but naomi's husband left the word which
[1:09:25] is the land because there was a famine
[1:09:27] in the land
[1:09:28] now it's funny to note that boaz never
[1:09:30] left the land
[1:09:32] but naomi's husband left the land
[1:09:34] because he had to make a living for them
[1:09:36] why because they were under economic
[1:09:38] crisis
[1:09:40] right which is the third seal the black
[1:09:42] horse rider with the scale in his hands
[1:09:44] so under economic crisis they cannot
[1:09:47] they cannot hang anymore
[1:09:49] so they move out but boaz has a
[1:09:50] revelation of the word
[1:09:52] and boaz is not going to let the third
[1:09:54] seal move him anywhere
[1:09:55] he's not going to let spiritual famine
[1:09:57] he's not going to let you know economic
[1:09:59] pressure with the balances in the hand
[1:10:01] of the horse right
[1:10:01] move him off of his land and when they
[1:10:03] come back he's exceedingly wealthy
[1:10:07] don't ever move off of this word for
[1:10:09] anything
[1:10:11] it doesn't matter what's happening in
[1:10:12] your life everything could be going
[1:10:14] absolutely wrong in your life amen your
[1:10:16] everybody's turned on you your family
[1:10:18] doesn't want you anymore you've lost
[1:10:20] your job you're losing your home
[1:10:21] you stay right on this word because
[1:10:24] boaz stood right in his land and when
[1:10:27] they returned
[1:10:28] amen uh naomi's husband
[1:10:31] lost everything
[1:10:34] and boaz was there in position to redeem
[1:10:37] it all back
[1:10:39] if you want to have any redemption for
[1:10:41] any of your family
[1:10:42] you stay in the land if you want to have
[1:10:45] redemption for any of the seed of god
[1:10:47] that has gone out under economic
[1:10:49] pressure under a red horse rider
[1:10:51] and backslid and gone into the world and
[1:10:53] gone to moab if you want to hold the
[1:10:55] door of redemption open for any of them
[1:10:57] you stay in your land and you become
[1:10:59] exceedingly wealthy
[1:11:02] in the spirit life exceedingly wealthy
[1:11:05] in your spiritual walk amen
[1:11:09] so now they go down to the land and when
[1:11:11] they go down to the land now they come
[1:11:12] to the fourth horse rider
[1:11:14] death he dies
[1:11:18] his sons die now naomi is the old church
[1:11:21] right
[1:11:22] and she's she's there and she's in the
[1:11:24] fourth horse rider she's in death
[1:11:27] and death is bringing tribulation
[1:11:30] and in tribulation tribulation in the
[1:11:33] sixth seal is always putting the jews in
[1:11:35] position
[1:11:36] six seals always putting the left in the
[1:11:37] homeland taking them back to the land
[1:11:40] and so now death comes and after death
[1:11:42] comes tribulation and now
[1:11:44] now naomi's in the sixth seal
[1:11:48] because god's using everything the
[1:11:50] destruction and everything to push her
[1:11:52] back to the homeland
[1:11:55] hallelujah the seals are in ruth
[1:11:59] brother venom said this is in the entire
[1:12:01] bible
[1:12:04] and so now naomi naomi
[1:12:07] has two daughters a wise and a foolish
[1:12:11] all right and they're going to go with
[1:12:12] her but one turns back
[1:12:14] because she doesn't have oil in her lamp
[1:12:16] but the other one she continues to go on
[1:12:19] so ruth goes on and now ruth goes
[1:12:21] through four stages
[1:12:24] i will restore saith the lord all that
[1:12:26] the canker worm and the
[1:12:28] palmer worm and the caterpillar has
[1:12:30] eaten all of those things now i will
[1:12:32] restore
[1:12:32] and restoring through luther through
[1:12:34] wesley through
[1:12:36] pentecost back to the bride age
[1:12:39] she comes through ruth deciding
[1:12:43] amen ruth serving
[1:12:46] ruth resting ruth rewarded brother
[1:12:49] brennam talks about the four stages of
[1:12:51] her journey
[1:12:52] what's happening she's coming out of
[1:12:54] spiritual death she's coming out of
[1:12:55] tribulation
[1:12:56] she's coming out of the dark ages and
[1:12:58] she's coming back into the land amen
[1:13:01] and she's moving back into an
[1:13:03] inheritance amen
[1:13:04] but she must have a redeemer
[1:13:08] so she comes in deciding and she's
[1:13:10] moving in the first stage and she comes
[1:13:12] to serving
[1:13:13] she's moving in the second stage why
[1:13:17] because deciding they had to decide to
[1:13:19] leave the old form and take on the new
[1:13:21] and the reformation
[1:13:22] they had to accept justification but
[1:13:24] when it came to serving
[1:13:26] brother branham said that that age was
[1:13:28] the great missionary age
[1:13:30] they were working so now she's serving
[1:13:32] then it comes to ruth resting because
[1:13:34] she's entered into the pentecostal holy
[1:13:36] ghost
[1:13:36] age and now the rest has returned
[1:13:40] but she's got to go beyond that she's
[1:13:42] got to go back
[1:13:43] to marrying the redeemer she's got to go
[1:13:46] to the fourth stage of the journey
[1:13:48] because justification makes a way for
[1:13:50] sanctification sanctification makes a
[1:13:52] way for the baptist in the holy ghost
[1:13:54] the baptismal holy ghost makes a way for
[1:13:56] the person of the holy ghost himself
[1:13:58] the seventh seal has to come on the
[1:14:00] scene
[1:14:02] which is the person of the holy ghost
[1:14:04] himself
[1:14:05] this holy ghost has been bound and
[1:14:07] chained by these denominational waters
[1:14:09] for nearly two thousand years
[1:14:11] but now in the end time by the evening
[1:14:13] time message to be loosed
[1:14:14] back upon the people again what is it
[1:14:17] it's the fourth stage of the journey
[1:14:19] it's the restoration back and what is
[1:14:21] ruth rewarded
[1:14:22] ruth marries boaz
[1:14:28] the seals are in ruth
[1:14:32] brother branham said the whole bible was
[1:14:36] sealed up in these seven seals
[1:14:38] and when he took it off he revealed the
[1:14:40] whole bible
[1:14:43] hallelujah so now
[1:14:47] she comes to the point that she wants to
[1:14:50] marry boaz
[1:14:51] so she slips in and she lays under his
[1:14:54] skirt and he wakes up and sees a woman
[1:14:57] and he recognizes
[1:14:58] you're righteous
[1:15:01] she doesn't seem to be doing something
[1:15:03] that's righteous but she's righteous why
[1:15:05] she's just like the woman at the well i
[1:15:07] want that water
[1:15:10] i want redemption amen something's
[1:15:13] moving her
[1:15:14] to do something that would people would
[1:15:16] question they would scratch their heads
[1:15:18] and not understand
[1:15:19] but she's something within her is moving
[1:15:21] she's thirsting for the birthright
[1:15:24] she's thirsting for the birthright and
[1:15:27] she moves in and she slides in under his
[1:15:29] skirt
[1:15:29] he wakes up and he sends her away
[1:15:32] and what's he send her away with six
[1:15:36] measures of barley
[1:15:40] six reveals the seventh where's the
[1:15:43] seventh
[1:15:45] boaz is the seventh the seventh isn't a
[1:15:49] thing
[1:15:50] the seventh is a person here's the
[1:15:53] person
[1:15:53] revealing the six seals to ruth and he
[1:15:56] says where's the seventh measure
[1:15:58] where's the seventh person you get to
[1:16:00] the seventh seal and you're reading it
[1:16:02] and it's the most anticlimactic moment
[1:16:04] of the message
[1:16:06] am i the only one
[1:16:11] and it's it's ruth and no doubt ruth had
[1:16:14] learned from naomi everything runs in
[1:16:15] cycles of seven
[1:16:16] six is man's number sevens is god's
[1:16:18] number completion and here's one
[1:16:20] and two and three and four and five
[1:16:24] and six and she brings it back to naomi
[1:16:26] and says see what i've gotten and naomi
[1:16:28] says
[1:16:28] rest here till all is accomplished
[1:16:32] because he's the seventh he doesn't
[1:16:35] reveal the seventh when he gives the six
[1:16:37] he always does it later like he doesn't
[1:16:39] preach the seventh seal to seventh seal
[1:16:41] he preaches that a christ is the mystery
[1:16:42] of god revealed
[1:16:44] he gives he gives the measures and then
[1:16:46] later
[1:16:48] he reveals i'm your seventh portion
[1:16:51] i'm the one who gave the six i'm the
[1:16:54] redeemer
[1:16:55] i'm the one who's buying it all back
[1:16:59] hallelujah we want to go read this whole
[1:17:02] bible again don't we
[1:17:03] i want to read every verse every line
[1:17:05] and say god give me i
[1:17:07] sav oh wipe my eyes clean
[1:17:11] i mentioned the woman at the well of
[1:17:12] samaria brother
[1:17:14] brother branham starts to tell us about
[1:17:15] the story and he tells us over and over
[1:17:17] and over again
[1:17:18] and it happens in the fourth chapter of
[1:17:19] the book of john
[1:17:21] now ruth has four stages of deliverance
[1:17:23] ruth is in four chapters
[1:17:27] because deliverance always comes in 4.
[1:17:30] and here in the fourth chapter of the
[1:17:32] gospel of john which is the bride's
[1:17:33] gospel
[1:17:34] in the fourth chapter we have this story
[1:17:36] of the woman at the well
[1:17:38] why that's my story that's your story
[1:17:41] it says jesus was tired so he rested on
[1:17:44] the well
[1:17:46] at the sixth hour of the day
[1:17:49] because the seventh is always revealed
[1:17:51] in the six
[1:17:53] in the sixth hour of the day he's
[1:17:55] resting and he begins to have this
[1:17:57] conversation with her
[1:17:58] and he says go get your husband
[1:18:02] how many husbands did she have
[1:18:06] six husbands where's the seventh the
[1:18:10] seventh is always a mystery
[1:18:14] because she's going to be united with
[1:18:16] the seventh
[1:18:17] and the seventh isn't openly declared
[1:18:19] the seventh is always a mystery
[1:18:22] boaz was the seventh measure christ was
[1:18:25] the seventh husband
[1:18:26] he's always the seven even if you go to
[1:18:29] the old
[1:18:30] testament tabernacle in the old
[1:18:31] testament tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:18:33] moses was told
[1:18:34] to make it according to the same fashion
[1:18:36] of the one he seen in heaven and the one
[1:18:38] on earth is reflecting that
[1:18:39] and there's six pieces of furniture
[1:18:42] you have the brazen altar the brazen
[1:18:44] laver the table of show bread
[1:18:46] the lamp stand the altar of incense and
[1:18:49] the ark of the covenant
[1:18:51] six the seventh is a mystery
[1:18:54] what's the seventh the seventh is a
[1:18:56] person
[1:18:58] it's the shekinah glory of god that
[1:19:00] dwells on the throne that dwells between
[1:19:02] the wings of the cherubim
[1:19:03] the seventh is not a thing the seventh
[1:19:06] is not information
[1:19:07] the seventh is a person
[1:19:11] i love this bible i love this word
[1:19:16] let's go to genesis chapter 1.
[1:19:25] hallelujah
[1:19:29] it's too much brothers and sisters it's
[1:19:32] so much
[1:19:41] brother branham and christ is the
[1:19:42] mystery of god revealed he says
[1:19:45] he says now if you would want to mark
[1:19:47] this down i got so many places and he
[1:19:49] takes him to luke 24.
[1:19:52] he said two of the apostles in the road
[1:19:53] emmaus jesus stepped out after his
[1:19:55] resurrection
[1:19:56] and they were on the road to emmaus
[1:19:57] going along the road thinking and
[1:19:59] talking and weeping on account of his
[1:20:00] death and
[1:20:01] how they seen him suffer and what they
[1:20:02] had thought was of no value at all they
[1:20:04] took their lord and crucified him
[1:20:06] they were going along weeping and he
[1:20:07] stepped out from the roadside and began
[1:20:09] to talk to them about christ he said o
[1:20:11] fools and slow to understand don't you
[1:20:14] know that all the prophets
[1:20:15] and the psalms see what was he doing
[1:20:18] identifying himself to the apostles
[1:20:22] that all the prophets in all the psalms
[1:20:26] and everything was him expressed
[1:20:31] that's why brother bam said if you don't
[1:20:33] see jesus christ in every verse and
[1:20:35] every line go back and read it again you
[1:20:37] miss something
[1:20:38] because why the seals revealed the
[1:20:41] mystery of the bible
[1:20:43] what was the mystery of the bible the
[1:20:45] seventh seal is the mystery of the whole
[1:20:47] bible
[1:20:48] the seventh seal is not a thing the
[1:20:50] seventh seal is a person
[1:20:52] and that person is christ and that is
[1:20:55] the theme of the entire bible
[1:20:57] and that's why those seven seals
[1:21:00] revealed the whole bible
[1:21:03] because now we come to the end of it we
[1:21:05] recognize that the whole thing is him
[1:21:08] every story is a redemption story why is
[1:21:10] every story in the old testament a
[1:21:11] redemption story
[1:21:13] because it's the story of redemption
[1:21:16] genesis 1 1.
[1:21:21] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:21:24] and the earth
[1:21:26] you know what you just read the seventh
[1:21:28] seal
[1:21:32] you believe me
[1:21:36] because what was the first thing that
[1:21:37] come out from god
[1:21:39] it was the word the logos and everything
[1:21:43] that was made was made by the word all
[1:21:45] things were made by him
[1:21:46] and for him and without him was not
[1:21:48] anything made that was made
[1:21:51] so in the opening verse he shows you the
[1:21:55] seventh seal
[1:21:57] the seventh seal is not a thing the
[1:21:59] seventh seal is a person
[1:22:02] you've not been united to a thing you've
[1:22:05] not been married to an idea
[1:22:07] or a thing you've been married to a
[1:22:09] person the person of the word
[1:22:11] which is jesus christ
[1:22:15] hallelujah now we go through creation
[1:22:20] and we come to six days of creation
[1:22:22] right you have six days of creation and
[1:22:24] what's seventh
[1:22:26] nothing you come to six seals you get to
[1:22:29] the seventh
[1:22:30] nothing uh matthew 24 jesus tells him
[1:22:33] the sixth seals he gets to the seventh
[1:22:35] he says nothing
[1:22:37] we come to six days of creation this is
[1:22:39] made this is the order this is done this
[1:22:40] is in order
[1:22:41] you get to the seventh nothing right the
[1:22:44] lord rested
[1:22:46] the seventh is always the mystery and
[1:22:49] nothing the seventh is always nothing
[1:22:53] because the six reveal the seventh
[1:22:57] do you believe me let's look
[1:23:01] let's look at creation here god makes no
[1:23:04] mistakes brother branham said
[1:23:06] genesis is the seed and what he
[1:23:07] establishes in genesis runs all the way
[1:23:09] out
[1:23:09] to the book of revelation genesis is the
[1:23:12] foundation revelation is the capstone
[1:23:15] and that's the whole bible that's christ
[1:23:18] that's the whole thing
[1:23:21] so let's go to chapter one verse
[1:23:25] three and god said let there be light
[1:23:27] and there was light and god saw the
[1:23:29] light
[1:23:30] that it was good and god divided the
[1:23:32] light from the darkness and god called
[1:23:34] the light day
[1:23:35] and the darkness he called night and the
[1:23:37] evening and the morning were the first
[1:23:38] day
[1:23:39] so we see he speaks and something
[1:23:41] happens there's a revelation of
[1:23:43] something in his mind
[1:23:45] right and then he says it's good we go
[1:23:48] down to verse 10
[1:23:50] and god called the dry land earth and he
[1:23:52] gathered together of the earth called
[1:23:53] seas and god saw
[1:23:54] that it was good verse 12 god saw
[1:23:58] that it was good verse 18 god saw that
[1:24:01] it was good
[1:24:02] verse 21 god saw that it was good
[1:24:06] it meant verse 25 and god saw that it
[1:24:09] was good
[1:24:10] how many goods did you count one
[1:24:14] two three four five six
[1:24:18] six times he says it's good brings you
[1:24:20] to the sixth day
[1:24:22] and what does he do on the sixth day
[1:24:27] he's going to reveal the seventh seal in
[1:24:29] the sixth day
[1:24:31] verse 26 and god said let us make man
[1:24:35] in our image after our likeness and let
[1:24:37] them have dominion over the fish of the
[1:24:39] sea
[1:24:39] over the fowl of the air and over all
[1:24:41] the cattle and over all the earth and
[1:24:43] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:24:45] so god created man in his own image and
[1:24:48] the image of god created he him
[1:24:50] male and female created he them
[1:24:53] what did he do the seventh seal
[1:24:59] brother branham said there's a threefold
[1:25:00] purpose to the whole book of the bible
[1:25:02] christ is mystery god revealed that god
[1:25:04] would get pre-eminence in a man
[1:25:05] that god would get reiman's in the
[1:25:07] church the bride and he would restore
[1:25:09] them to an eaten condition
[1:25:13] amen the day six
[1:25:16] the six thousandth year of creation and
[1:25:19] the sixth day
[1:25:20] he creates man in his own image in the
[1:25:23] image of god creates a male and female
[1:25:26] he creates them right
[1:25:29] in the in chapter five he says and calls
[1:25:31] their name
[1:25:32] adam in the masterpiece brother branham
[1:25:35] says see this is his masterpiece
[1:25:37] family this is the masterpiece of god
[1:25:39] what is the masterpiece the two
[1:25:42] being one the masterpiece of god is the
[1:25:45] two
[1:25:46] being one and he said the whole old
[1:25:48] testament was speaking of him
[1:25:50] from the foundation of the patriarchs
[1:25:52] coming through the kings
[1:25:53] coming through the prophets and the
[1:25:54] psalms and the proverbs what is it until
[1:25:56] he comes to the capstone which is jesus
[1:25:58] christ standing on the earth and he's
[1:26:00] the fullness of the old testament
[1:26:03] but that wasn't the whole masterpiece in
[1:26:05] order to make the masterpiece
[1:26:07] there was part of the masterpiece inside
[1:26:09] the first image
[1:26:11] that's why and when we get to genesis
[1:26:14] chapter 2 let's go over there for just a
[1:26:16] second
[1:26:20] genesis chapter 2
[1:26:24] verse 18 this genesis chapter 2 is
[1:26:27] describing the sixth day
[1:26:30] so you inject this into the sixth day
[1:26:33] and in the sixth day verse eighteen said
[1:26:35] and the lord said that it
[1:26:36] is not good that man shall be alone
[1:26:41] now here's a mystery it's good it's good
[1:26:45] it's good it's good it's good it's good
[1:26:48] six times and in the breach between the
[1:26:51] sixth and the seventh seal
[1:26:56] in the breach in genesis chapter one in
[1:26:59] the gap
[1:27:00] between the six goods and the sixth day
[1:27:03] and the seventh seal the sixth and the
[1:27:05] seventh seal on the sixth day there's a
[1:27:07] gap on the sixth day
[1:27:09] the breach is on the sixth day he says
[1:27:12] something he's never said before
[1:27:14] it is not good
[1:27:17] what's not good it's good that jesus
[1:27:20] christ it's not good that jesus christ
[1:27:21] will be alone and not have a bride
[1:27:24] it is it is not good that this man that
[1:27:26] i made in my image male and female
[1:27:28] stands alone it is not good that man is
[1:27:30] alone
[1:27:31] now he wasn't alone because all the
[1:27:33] attributes of the female were in him
[1:27:36] he was amen he was created in the image
[1:27:39] of god male and female
[1:27:40] and he's now put into a form and in that
[1:27:43] form he's now alone
[1:27:45] and he says it's not good why he wants
[1:27:48] you to see the mystery of the seventh
[1:27:50] it's good it's good it's good it's good
[1:27:52] it's good it's not good
[1:27:56] so then he strikes a little blow over on
[1:27:58] his side
[1:28:00] and he pulls out of him the bride and
[1:28:02] puts her in a separate form
[1:28:04] and she's formed up the bride and then
[1:28:06] he unites them together
[1:28:08] and brother branham said the crowning
[1:28:09] act of his creation
[1:28:12] the crowning act of his creation his
[1:28:15] masterpiece now completed
[1:28:17] the two being one let's go back to
[1:28:19] genesis chapter 1.
[1:28:24] in verse 31 chapter two is injected into
[1:28:29] chapter one it's the sixth day
[1:28:31] now we're coming back verse 31
[1:28:35] in god so everything that he had made
[1:28:37] and behold
[1:28:38] it was very good
[1:28:42] do we see the mystery it's good it's
[1:28:45] good it's good it's good it's good it's
[1:28:47] good it's not good
[1:28:49] something has to change what is he
[1:28:52] bringing the revelation of the seventh
[1:28:54] seal
[1:28:54] he comes back to verse 31 and now he
[1:28:57] looked at all that he had made
[1:29:00] all of his creation and he says it's
[1:29:03] very good
[1:29:09] and then you come to chapter two
[1:29:14] and the seventh day the lord ended his
[1:29:16] work which he had made
[1:29:18] and he rested on the seventh day from
[1:29:19] all his works he had made
[1:29:21] the seventh seal doesn't do anything
[1:29:24] now you've entered into millennium he
[1:29:26] did it all on the sixth day
[1:29:29] so there was six thousand years of
[1:29:32] creation a day is unto the lord is a
[1:29:34] thousand years a thousand years into a
[1:29:35] day for six thousand years
[1:29:37] he gets to the sixth day he in the sixth
[1:29:40] day
[1:29:40] he makes the image of himself male and
[1:29:43] female
[1:29:44] his masterpiece he places it in the
[1:29:46] garden he moves into the seventh day
[1:29:48] and in the seventh day satan comes in
[1:29:50] and mars the image
[1:29:52] all right so what's he start doing he
[1:29:54] starts building back again
[1:29:56] how long does it take 6 000 years
[1:30:00] now we're in the second sabbath cycle
[1:30:03] because remember the lamb was kept up
[1:30:05] for 14 days for two sabbaths
[1:30:07] you have a you have a sabbath cycle that
[1:30:09] brings
[1:30:10] god's idea into eden god's idea of a man
[1:30:14] and woman united together in eden
[1:30:15] it gets destroyed then he starts the
[1:30:17] second sabbath cycle and the whole bible
[1:30:21] is the second
[1:30:21] sabbath cycle and the whole story was
[1:30:25] told in genesis chapter
[1:30:27] one that sets the pattern
[1:30:30] and everything's been living off of that
[1:30:32] pattern ever since
[1:30:34] so now we've come to the sixth
[1:30:35] thousandth day
[1:30:39] we're in the sixth thousands we're in
[1:30:42] the sixth day
[1:30:45] and in the sixth day he opens the sixth
[1:30:48] seal because the sixth seal begins at
[1:30:50] world war ii
[1:30:51] because the sixth seal begins with the
[1:30:54] sixth trumpet which is world war ii the
[1:30:55] second woe
[1:30:56] and under the sixth seal he has the
[1:30:59] ministry of william branham
[1:31:01] he has the the angel constellation he
[1:31:04] has the revelation of the seven seals
[1:31:06] he has that and this this sixth sixth
[1:31:09] day
[1:31:09] goes all the way to millennium this
[1:31:11] sixth seal
[1:31:13] goes all the way to the millennium
[1:31:16] so in the sixth what does he do
[1:31:19] he reveals the seventh because the
[1:31:22] seventh isn't anything
[1:31:25] nothing happens on the seventh the
[1:31:26] seventh is everything he did in the
[1:31:28] sixth
[1:31:29] now rest in the seventh
[1:31:32] in genesis one everything he did in six
[1:31:35] thousand years and all that he did
[1:31:37] everything come to the masterpiece
[1:31:39] everything come to the culmination
[1:31:41] on the sixth day and on the sixth day he
[1:31:43] reveals the seventh seal
[1:31:45] and then seventh day he doesn't do
[1:31:46] anything
[1:31:48] hallelujah we're in the sixth day
[1:31:51] and in the sixth day under the sixth
[1:31:53] seal at the time of the sixth trumpet
[1:31:59] he reveals the seventh seal he unites
[1:32:01] the bride and the bridegroom
[1:32:03] he does it all with all the work of
[1:32:04] redemption in the sixth and he comes to
[1:32:06] the seventh
[1:32:08] and they rest in the millennium
[1:32:13] the sixth reveals the seventh
[1:32:17] that's why when you get your seven seven
[1:32:20] seal book
[1:32:22] and you're reading through and you're
[1:32:23] like i get it i get it i get it i get it
[1:32:27] one thing i'm realizing i didn't even
[1:32:28] get half of it
[1:32:32] i was putting it back there and over
[1:32:33] there and brother branham said if you
[1:32:35] read the word
[1:32:36] amen the man's made the big mistake of
[1:32:38] always taking it and putting it back
[1:32:40] there or
[1:32:40] forward he said it's all going to come
[1:32:43] home today
[1:32:44] this whole bible has to come home today
[1:32:48] these whole seven seals have to come
[1:32:49] home today
[1:32:51] not over there and over there so when
[1:32:52] you read the you say oh yeah that
[1:32:53] happened oh that's going to happen
[1:32:55] you've missed the seals just like in
[1:32:59] revelations amen revelations uh chapter
[1:33:02] one two and three
[1:33:03] there's seven letters written to seven
[1:33:05] churches
[1:33:07] so if you start thinking oh yeah there
[1:33:08] were seven churches yeah this one was
[1:33:09] over there they're in turkey and
[1:33:11] yeah then you've missed the whole thing
[1:33:14] you've got to bring it today they've got
[1:33:17] to come
[1:33:18] today to catch the revelation and the
[1:33:21] seven seals have to come home today
[1:33:23] to catch the revelation that's why when
[1:33:25] you read when you read the new testament
[1:33:27] you said oh he wrote a letter to the
[1:33:28] corinthians oh
[1:33:29] they were having a problem yeah the
[1:33:31] women were getting up and shouting back
[1:33:33] and forth so he said let your women keep
[1:33:34] silencing church
[1:33:35] you've missed the bible you've missed
[1:33:38] the epistle
[1:33:39] and that's what the denominations have
[1:33:40] done they've totally missed the word
[1:33:42] because they've misplaced the word
[1:33:44] they've placed it all in a previous day
[1:33:47] or in a forward day and that's why they
[1:33:49] don't get the book of revelation it's
[1:33:50] all forward
[1:33:51] the rest of everything that's been
[1:33:52] written is passed and they don't miss
[1:33:54] the fact that it's an eternal word
[1:33:58] what he told the corinthians he's
[1:33:59] telling me what he told the romans he's
[1:34:01] telling me
[1:34:03] and paul testifies to this he says unto
[1:34:05] us
[1:34:06] unto whom the world the end of the world
[1:34:09] has come that was two thousand years ago
[1:34:13] he said that
[1:34:14] because he wasn't writing it to the
[1:34:16] crowd two thousand years ago he was
[1:34:18] writing it for us today that bible was
[1:34:21] pinned
[1:34:22] from the from the in the beginning to
[1:34:24] the amen
[1:34:25] was pinned for us today because the
[1:34:28] capstone of it
[1:34:29] is revelation amen the revelation of
[1:34:31] jesus christ is the whole mystery
[1:34:33] of the whole bible revealed in the book
[1:34:35] of revelation and this is the capstone
[1:34:37] time
[1:34:38] the capstone ministry and it's the whole
[1:34:40] bible wound up into a capstone ministry
[1:34:44] a bride on the earth at the end time
[1:34:46] who's fleshing out the entire word
[1:34:51] this is where we've made our mistakes
[1:34:54] this is where we've used reasoning
[1:34:57] should i get this job or that job should
[1:34:58] i go to school or not go to school
[1:35:01] and we're using our brains because we
[1:35:04] think this word was for that day
[1:35:07] this bible doesn't tell me whether i
[1:35:09] should go to college or not
[1:35:12] yes it does this bible doesn't tell me
[1:35:15] everything about a modern day life and
[1:35:17] in this millennial age yes it does
[1:35:22] why would god leave us anything but the
[1:35:25] very best to run our lives why would god
[1:35:28] leave us to human reasoning when he has
[1:35:30] never left it to human reasoning before
[1:35:34] i say god take the isaf off of my eyes
[1:35:37] i sat down and talked to some members of
[1:35:38] my family recently and i realized that i
[1:35:40] had made a mistake
[1:35:43] because i was reasoning with my children
[1:35:45] well don't you think you want to do this
[1:35:47] or wouldn't this be a better idea
[1:35:49] that's all human reasoning and it's all
[1:35:52] rubbish it's all garbage so i sat down
[1:35:56] with him i started doing things
[1:35:57] differently
[1:35:58] i said the bible says this and the bible
[1:36:00] says this
[1:36:01] and the bible says this and they got it
[1:36:04] they absolutely caught it
[1:36:06] it's not for over there and it's not for
[1:36:07] over there i can take this word here
[1:36:09] because it's an eternal word
[1:36:11] and i'm eternal being and this is christ
[1:36:13] and i'm part of christ
[1:36:15] so god has not left us to human
[1:36:17] reasoning to manage our lives
[1:36:19] he's not left us to flipping coins to
[1:36:21] see which side's heads and tails
[1:36:23] that is not how we're supposed to live
[1:36:24] our life we are supposed to live our
[1:36:26] life according to that word
[1:36:27] and we have to find our identification
[1:36:29] in this word what does this word say
[1:36:31] about me as a mother what does this word
[1:36:33] say about me as a father
[1:36:34] what does this word say about me as a
[1:36:36] single person what does the word say
[1:36:37] about me as a widow the widow is an
[1:36:39] office in the church
[1:36:43] the poor is an office in the church
[1:36:47] those that mourn and those that rejoice
[1:36:49] are parts of the body
[1:36:52] it's in the word everything's in the
[1:36:54] word we have to start finding our
[1:36:56] position
[1:36:57] in the word what does the word say and
[1:37:00] now i will line my life to these
[1:37:02] scriptures
[1:37:04] we have to absolutely get away from
[1:37:06] reasoning to figure our way through life
[1:37:08] we don't reason our way through life
[1:37:10] it's faith and the scripture and brother
[1:37:12] branham told us
[1:37:13] he said when a son or daughter of god
[1:37:15] takes the word of god
[1:37:16] from their hearts by faith places it on
[1:37:19] their lips it's the same as
[1:37:20] deity speaking
[1:37:24] our answer to everything to date has
[1:37:26] been reasoning
[1:37:28] jesus never walked by reasoning
[1:37:31] he never conversed with people by
[1:37:33] reasoning there came a time
[1:37:36] that jesus had to keep his own law
[1:37:39] and he had to give unto caesar what was
[1:37:41] caesar's and it came tax season
[1:37:44] and he didn't say oh you know we got
[1:37:47] this
[1:37:48] tax issue i'll pick up a second job or
[1:37:50] peter maybe you could go back and fish a
[1:37:52] little bit
[1:37:54] he needed to pay taxes so he said peter
[1:37:56] go cast thy line into
[1:37:58] and catch one fish not to sell
[1:38:02] to pull a coin out of its mouth to pay
[1:38:05] his taxes
[1:38:07] jesus never lived by reasoning
[1:38:10] he never reasoned anything he lived a
[1:38:14] life by
[1:38:15] faith and your faith has to be founded
[1:38:18] on something
[1:38:20] your faith cannot be founded on i think
[1:38:24] poor foundation faith cannot be founded
[1:38:27] on
[1:38:27] well i presume
[1:38:30] or i'm trying you can't base your faith
[1:38:34] on any of that
[1:38:35] the only thing you can do is base your
[1:38:36] faith on the word of god
[1:38:41] how do i conduct my home quit reading
[1:38:44] the books in the bible bookstore
[1:38:47] this book will tell you if you come to
[1:38:50] him with isaf
[1:38:51] and let him take the isab to your eyes
[1:38:54] and you read the book of proverbs the
[1:38:55] book of proverbs will tell you how to
[1:38:57] raise your children
[1:39:01] we've got to stop with all all the
[1:39:04] foolishness of the world
[1:39:06] the seventh seal has been revealed to us
[1:39:09] the seals have been lifted off of this
[1:39:11] bible
[1:39:12] we know that this is a living book
[1:39:14] living and breathing today
[1:39:16] this is an eternal word and every word
[1:39:18] in there will work for me today
[1:39:22] this is what the seals have opened up to
[1:39:24] us
[1:39:25] the mystery of the seventh seal
[1:39:28] the mystery of god is christ
[1:39:31] so now now we have to look things
[1:39:34] totally different than we've ever looked
[1:39:35] at them before
[1:39:36] because god is building upon the earth a
[1:39:39] faith
[1:39:40] civilization
[1:39:43] he's returning us under the ministry of
[1:39:45] malachi 4 in revelation 10 7
[1:39:47] back to the original faith
[1:39:53] original faith of the fathers that
[1:39:55] original faith was based on the word
[1:39:58] not presuming not reasoning not thinking
[1:40:00] it was a life based on faith in the word
[1:40:02] jesus every step he made was based on
[1:40:05] the word
[1:40:06] here he comes in in every situation he
[1:40:09] finds
[1:40:10] he's quoting something out of the old
[1:40:12] testament
[1:40:14] only if you're a theologian and you're a
[1:40:17] student of the word
[1:40:18] you say he took that out of context
[1:40:22] go study the things that jesus says
[1:40:25] and go back and look at where he took
[1:40:26] that from the scripture
[1:40:28] and you would say how can he get this
[1:40:30] from that
[1:40:32] how many has done that and realizes
[1:40:34] jesus did not use reasoning
[1:40:36] jesus was taking the word and he
[1:40:38] recognized that's an eternal word
[1:40:41] and i'm an eternal being that word is
[1:40:44] christ and i'm christ
[1:40:46] that happened to david he didn't just
[1:40:48] write that for himself
[1:40:49] that's for me and jesus did it
[1:40:53] all the time all the time every time he
[1:40:56] spoke he's speaking the scriptures
[1:40:59] and most of the time you and your human
[1:41:01] reasoning and your human mind
[1:41:02] you would say that doesn't fit he took
[1:41:04] that out of context that doesn't even
[1:41:06] apply today
[1:41:08] i mean look at joel's prophecy that that
[1:41:11] peter picks up this prophecy
[1:41:13] on the day of pentecost and he says this
[1:41:15] is that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:41:17] joel
[1:41:17] and and he only takes a little bit out
[1:41:19] of it
[1:41:21] and if you read the whole thing the
[1:41:22] whole thing doesn't apply to the day of
[1:41:24] pentecost
[1:41:27] it applies to the restoration of the
[1:41:29] children of israel back to the land
[1:41:31] it doesn't it's not even an exact
[1:41:33] application
[1:41:35] how dare peter how can peter just slice
[1:41:38] and dice the word like that
[1:41:39] how can he pull some from here and pull
[1:41:41] some from there how can he take a
[1:41:43] snippet out of joel
[1:41:44] that doesn't even apply
[1:41:47] because he's an eternal being and that's
[1:41:49] an eternal word
[1:41:51] and by revelation he knows what word
[1:41:52] will work today
[1:41:54] and he knows what this is that's
[1:41:55] speaking in tongues i know what this is
[1:41:57] and they say well what about all the
[1:41:58] prophecy that's for another time this is
[1:42:00] this part of the prophecy
[1:42:03] hallelujah if you want to be a bible
[1:42:05] student you cannot live like the
[1:42:07] apostles lived
[1:42:08] as a bible student
[1:42:11] you absolutely cannot be a bible student
[1:42:13] a modern day bible student
[1:42:15] that has to have everything in context
[1:42:17] and greek translations of every word
[1:42:20] and everything placed in its proper
[1:42:21] place according to the timelines
[1:42:23] and this happened here and this event
[1:42:25] happened there if you're that kind of
[1:42:26] bible student
[1:42:27] you cannot be a book of acts believer
[1:42:32] because that is not how they believe the
[1:42:34] bible that is not how they practice the
[1:42:36] scriptures
[1:42:37] and that is not how they quoted the
[1:42:38] scriptures
[1:42:40] amen brother bam told us he said
[1:42:44] he said listen i was with noah when he
[1:42:47] built the ark
[1:42:51] what's he talking about the seventh seal
[1:42:54] why because noah was an expression of
[1:42:57] christ
[1:42:58] i'm an expression of christ we're in the
[1:43:00] same family of christ
[1:43:02] i was with noah when he was he's
[1:43:04] expressing the seventh seal
[1:43:06] the whole bible every character every
[1:43:08] type what is it it's christ unveiled
[1:43:10] christ unveiled down through moses down
[1:43:12] through abraham down through moses
[1:43:14] out in the exodus coming in through
[1:43:16] joshua commission what is it
[1:43:17] it's a manifestation an unveiling of god
[1:43:20] revealing what was in the back part of
[1:43:21] god's mind it's the seventh seal
[1:43:23] being opened
[1:43:27] and then he comes and he calls you and
[1:43:29] you recognize it's him
[1:43:30] you hear the scream of the eagle and you
[1:43:32] recognize it's him unite to him
[1:43:34] and then he's coming some more he's
[1:43:37] coming in you
[1:43:39] and then another one's quick in the life
[1:43:40] he's coming some more and another one's
[1:43:42] quick in life he's coming some more
[1:43:43] that's why the seventh seal is the
[1:43:45] mystery of his coming
[1:43:47] and then brother branham changes that
[1:43:49] feast of trumpets he said now it's the
[1:43:50] mystery of the going
[1:43:54] and somebody else comes he's coming he's
[1:43:56] coming in you he's coming in you
[1:43:58] he's coming and you he's coming in you
[1:44:00] until he's done coming
[1:44:02] and when he's done coming now he's going
[1:44:06] what is it it's the seventh seal
[1:44:10] hallelujah he says i was there
[1:44:14] i was there when moses was talking to
[1:44:16] the burning bush
[1:44:20] hallelujah your brain won't remember
[1:44:22] that
[1:44:25] that's why we have to have the mind of
[1:44:26] christ because you've got
[1:44:28] human memory and human memory doesn't
[1:44:30] remember being at the burning bush but
[1:44:32] the mind of christ remembers being at
[1:44:33] the burning bush
[1:44:35] with the mind of christ i remember being
[1:44:37] there on the day of creation when he
[1:44:38] said let there be light
[1:44:39] brother bam said i was there why because
[1:44:42] i have the mind of christ
[1:44:43] and now i have my right mind i have the
[1:44:46] memory i was supposed to have from day
[1:44:48] one
[1:44:48] my human memory my human affections my
[1:44:51] human reasoning
[1:44:52] will not work but if i take the
[1:44:54] reasoning of christ which is faith
[1:44:57] and i take the memory of christ i take
[1:44:59] the affection of christ
[1:45:01] amen i take all these things of christ
[1:45:03] now i remember
[1:45:04] oh yes i was there
[1:45:09] i was there when he said let there be
[1:45:10] light why because i'm part of the logos
[1:45:13] i'm part of christ i was there i was
[1:45:16] there
[1:45:16] when he spoke to the squirrels
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:21] i was there in colorado when he said why
[1:45:23] don't you walk with me
[1:45:26] and brother branham said if you don't
[1:45:29] remember that
[1:45:30] he said you've got spiritual amnesia and
[1:45:33] you don't know who you
[1:45:34] are
[1:45:37] you're not just a person who lives on
[1:45:39] this side street somewhere and works at
[1:45:41] this place
[1:45:42] and come out of this family that's not
[1:45:43] who you are
[1:45:45] you've got spiritual amnesia if all you
[1:45:48] see is your manual labor
[1:45:50] and your physical home and your physical
[1:45:52] family you have
[1:45:53] absolutely missed it all you need the
[1:45:55] mind of christ
[1:45:56] you need to get your memory back you've
[1:45:59] got spiritual amnesia and you've lost
[1:46:01] your memory
[1:46:02] you don't even know who you are you're a
[1:46:04] part of christ you're a part of the
[1:46:05] seventh seal you're the seventh seal on
[1:46:07] display today
[1:46:10] you're part of genesis 1 1. you're part
[1:46:12] of john 1 1.
[1:46:13] you're part of revelations 1 1.
[1:46:17] and if you're not there you've got
[1:46:19] spiritual amnesia
[1:46:20] and you don't know who you are
[1:46:26] so now let's pick up this bible
[1:46:32] if i was with moses
[1:46:37] and this word worked for moses when i
[1:46:39] was with moses
[1:46:41] why won't the eternal word work for me
[1:46:43] now
[1:46:46] if i was with david and was while i was
[1:46:48] with david
[1:46:49] [Laughter]
[1:46:52] this word worked then why
[1:46:55] can't i if i'm an eternal being in his
[1:46:58] eternal word
[1:46:59] why can't i take the word that worked
[1:47:00] once and use it again
[1:47:04] if i relied on it to get me out of
[1:47:05] trouble when we were in egypt
[1:47:10] why can't i rely on it now to get me out
[1:47:12] of trouble if it worked in the first
[1:47:14] exodus and it worked in the second
[1:47:16] exodus why won't it work in the third
[1:47:17] exodus
[1:47:19] hallelujah we've got to go beyond the
[1:47:22] human boundaries
[1:47:23] of our lives and step beyond into what
[1:47:25] we were created to be
[1:47:27] we were born to be supernatural beings
[1:47:30] amateur gods sons of god and the whole
[1:47:33] creation is groaning for the
[1:47:35] manifestation
[1:47:36] of the sons of god we weren't placed on
[1:47:38] this earth this is the book of acts
[1:47:43] amen where
[1:47:46] they tried to worship paul
[1:47:51] paul and barnabas they dropped down and
[1:47:54] said the gods have come down
[1:47:56] unto us
[1:47:59] why because they were messiest
[1:48:03] they had been cured from spiritual
[1:48:04] amnesia they knew the word would work
[1:48:08] they knew that they had the right to
[1:48:09] administer the word and they
[1:48:11] operated it by faith not by their
[1:48:13] reasoning see when i say we take this
[1:48:15] word to live by
[1:48:16] you can't just pull something out and
[1:48:18] say oh you that's reasoning
[1:48:19] it operates by faith you say god take
[1:48:22] the isab off my eyes
[1:48:24] show me in this word the solution to my
[1:48:26] problem because you would have never
[1:48:27] left a word that was a sealed book that
[1:48:29] can't be added to or taken away from
[1:48:31] if my solution today was not in that
[1:48:33] book
[1:48:35] we have lost faith in our bibles and
[1:48:37] that's why we've turned to bible
[1:48:38] bookstores full of garbage
[1:48:41] because we have lost faith in the sealed
[1:48:43] book
[1:48:44] that you cannot add to and you cannot
[1:48:46] take away from
[1:48:47] so my life is a sealed life under the
[1:48:49] power of the holy ghost and i can take
[1:48:51] the book
[1:48:53] that's been opened by the seven seals
[1:48:57] and i can say lord you have left me a
[1:48:59] solution
[1:49:03] you may find it in the old testament you
[1:49:05] may even find it in a minor prophet
[1:49:09] but once that revelation strikes you
[1:49:11] that won't be no minor revelation
[1:49:14] because it's our victory we overcome our
[1:49:16] faith is based on something
[1:49:18] and our faith is based on the word of
[1:49:20] god
[1:49:24] remember the sixth reveals the seventh
[1:49:28] let's turn to the gospels and we're just
[1:49:31] going to wrap up here because we could
[1:49:33] preach
[1:49:33] all day
[1:49:38] i just want to point a few things out i
[1:49:40] want you to study your scriptures and
[1:49:42] take what you've heard today and go back
[1:49:43] and relook at the word again
[1:49:45] but do you remember jesus's first
[1:49:47] miracle
[1:49:50] it was at a wedding
[1:49:52] [Laughter]
[1:49:54] what is he telling us jesus first
[1:49:57] recorded miracles at a wedding
[1:50:00] and what does he do he turns water into
[1:50:02] wine
[1:50:04] we got that but how much wine
[1:50:10] six water bots full
[1:50:13] why six six is the number of man i mean
[1:50:17] why
[1:50:17] six why the sixth day of creation
[1:50:21] why under the sixth seal why during the
[1:50:23] sixth trumpet
[1:50:24] why because the six reveals the seventh
[1:50:27] six water pots full of water turned to
[1:50:29] wine revealing what
[1:50:30] the seventh seal the seventh is always
[1:50:34] the person
[1:50:36] hallelujah oh i get so excited
[1:50:41] gabriel the angel comes to mary to
[1:50:45] announce to her that she's going to have
[1:50:47] the messiah
[1:50:50] it says in the scriptures he came to her
[1:50:53] in the sixth month
[1:50:56] what six months the sixth month after
[1:50:58] her her cousin elizabeth was pregnant
[1:51:01] but the scripture says that and in the
[1:51:03] sixth month
[1:51:04] the angel gabriel was sent from god
[1:51:07] in the sixth month what does he reveal
[1:51:09] he reveals the seventh seal
[1:51:12] where's the seventh seal the seventh
[1:51:13] seal is going to be in the virgin
[1:51:17] where's the there's been an angel in our
[1:51:19] day and after
[1:51:20] six what's in the sixth day what's he
[1:51:22] reveal he reveals the seventh seal
[1:51:24] where's the seventh seal the seven seals
[1:51:26] in the virgin
[1:51:29] hallelujah this is all over us
[1:51:33] this is all around us this is all
[1:51:35] through the scriptures
[1:51:38] oh praise the lord
[1:51:43] let's go to john 19.
[1:51:49] verse 13.
[1:51:53] now do you see why brother brenham after
[1:51:54] he preached to seals he said my bible
[1:51:56] has become a new book
[1:51:59] he was seeing things he hasn't even told
[1:52:02] us about
[1:52:03] but by revelation god is pointing us
[1:52:05] right back to these things
[1:52:08] the sixth reveals the seventh why in the
[1:52:10] sixth day what does he reveal in the
[1:52:12] forming of man
[1:52:13] man's the sixth day the number of man is
[1:52:16] six the bible has 66 books
[1:52:20] what do the 66 books reveal the seventh
[1:52:24] the 66 revealed the seven it's the same
[1:52:26] thing over
[1:52:27] and over and over again that's why
[1:52:30] brother branham could get to these
[1:52:31] opening seals he says
[1:52:32] my bible has been a new book he goes
[1:52:34] i'll never be the same i'll never
[1:52:36] think the same again and now when you
[1:52:39] pick this up and you realize
[1:52:40] everywhere i go is the seventh seal
[1:52:42] everything i read is the six seals and
[1:52:44] the seventh seal
[1:52:45] and now you realize my life is not
[1:52:47] mundane my life is not ordinary
[1:52:49] my life that i'm fleshing out today is
[1:52:52] all the way from genesis to revelation
[1:52:53] it's all
[1:52:54] a living word living today this is not
[1:52:56] boring
[1:52:58] this is not information this is where
[1:53:01] i'm
[1:53:02] at i'm standing here in the scriptures
[1:53:04] that's why i said for me it's no more
[1:53:06] reading the word
[1:53:07] it's not two-dimensional i have climbed
[1:53:09] down inside the bible
[1:53:10] and i'm walking around ruth and i'm
[1:53:12] looking i'm saying four stages of
[1:53:14] restoration
[1:53:15] i'm saying six measures of barley oh my
[1:53:18] goodness it's all here
[1:53:19] it's coming to a wedding and after she's
[1:53:21] married what happens is the seventh seal
[1:53:24] is inside of her now
[1:53:28] and what does she do with it after she
[1:53:31] gives birth to it
[1:53:32] she lays it on the lap of naomi
[1:53:35] and brother branham said the gentiles
[1:53:37] will carry this message back to the jews
[1:53:41] she'll bring forth christ and after she
[1:53:43] brings forth christ
[1:53:44] ruth turns around and she lays this baby
[1:53:47] on the lap of naomi
[1:53:51] and that's exactly what we're going to
[1:53:52] do lay this on the lap of naomi and then
[1:53:54] we're going home
[1:53:57] what am i doing i'm walking in ruth i'm
[1:54:00] in it
[1:54:01] i'm not looking at it i'm inside of it
[1:54:04] it's affecting my life it's the force
[1:54:06] that's moving me along
[1:54:08] just like brother branham's life was
[1:54:10] directed by the word that was already
[1:54:12] written
[1:54:12] his life was directed by matthew 24.
[1:54:17] his life is directed by the book of
[1:54:18] revelation and he doesn't know why he
[1:54:20] tries to do this and it doesn't work out
[1:54:22] tries to get a ten it doesn't work out
[1:54:24] what's happening he's preaching now
[1:54:26] he's preaching the revelation of jesus
[1:54:28] christ the church ages he goes into
[1:54:30] revelations five
[1:54:31] and for two years he cannot go any
[1:54:33] further
[1:54:35] why he's being held back
[1:54:38] by what the written word
[1:54:41] he gets to the seventh seal and he says
[1:54:44] i just feel checked not to go any
[1:54:45] further
[1:54:47] i feel to stop why what's he feeling
[1:54:50] what's moving on him what is holding him
[1:54:52] pushing him steering the ship
[1:54:54] what is it it's the word that has
[1:54:56] already been written
[1:54:57] and now he can't go beyond that he can't
[1:55:00] give the revelation the seventh seal he
[1:55:02] can't unfold it clearly he's got to give
[1:55:04] a few clues a few
[1:55:06] signs some events leading up to it and
[1:55:08] then he's got to stop
[1:55:11] and then we have silence on the seven
[1:55:13] seals
[1:55:15] until we get to christ as the mystery of
[1:55:16] god revealed
[1:55:18] what is he doing he is matching the word
[1:55:23] and if that word that was written 2 000
[1:55:26] years before the prophet showed up
[1:55:28] can direct his life so accurately that
[1:55:30] beyond his will
[1:55:31] and beyond his thinking his every
[1:55:33] footstep is in line with this word
[1:55:35] what is it doing to you and i what is
[1:55:38] this bible when it talks about
[1:55:40] every joint supplies to the ed the
[1:55:42] edifying of the body
[1:55:43] what's he talking about he's talking
[1:55:45] about today
[1:55:47] but he talks about the fifo ministry
[1:55:49] amen will bring the church to maturity
[1:55:51] to perfection until we all grow
[1:55:53] up into the head what's he talking about
[1:55:55] the head was never here till today
[1:55:57] that verse in ephesians is speaking up
[1:55:59] today
[1:56:03] it's all talking of today it's talking
[1:56:05] about the body every joint supply
[1:56:08] and christ is the head of the body
[1:56:10] what's he talking about he's talking
[1:56:12] about our day
[1:56:14] and that scripture is directing your
[1:56:16] life
[1:56:17] that scripture is moving you into
[1:56:19] position because you're a knee
[1:56:21] you're an elbow you're a finger you're
[1:56:24] something in this body
[1:56:25] and this word is moving you from a place
[1:56:27] you used to go to a new place
[1:56:30] it's moving you amen and it's doing
[1:56:33] things to you that you can't imagine
[1:56:34] people think you're crazy things go
[1:56:36] wrong i've lost my job
[1:56:38] this church split things folded up
[1:56:40] what's happened he's got
[1:56:42] to get you in position because the word
[1:56:44] already says
[1:56:45] it'll be a mini-membered body and there
[1:56:47] won't be one piece
[1:56:49] missing your life is
[1:56:52] just as directed if you be a c gene of
[1:56:54] god your life
[1:56:56] is just as directed if that prophet's
[1:56:58] life was
[1:57:00] things don't work out for you why
[1:57:02] because he's got a plan
[1:57:04] sometimes doors just open wide open and
[1:57:06] you couldn't imagine how i got this
[1:57:08] blessed why
[1:57:08] he's got a plan he's walking you right
[1:57:11] in his word
[1:57:14] that's why we come to this word and say
[1:57:15] okay lord
[1:57:17] this word is directing every step
[1:57:20] this word is directing everything i do
[1:57:23] show me
[1:57:23] in your word don't use my brain
[1:57:27] not my reasoning i want the mind of
[1:57:29] christ which is the word of god
[1:57:31] and show me bring back my memory
[1:57:34] bring back my memory lord give me that
[1:57:38] holy ghost reasoning lord that i might
[1:57:40] understand
[1:57:41] what you would have me do in this day
[1:57:44] give me the eye salve and take the
[1:57:45] scales off my eyes
[1:57:47] because if i can find it in the word and
[1:57:49] my heart has faith to believe it
[1:57:51] i can have it it'll deliver me
[1:57:54] it's worked in every age it'll work
[1:57:57] today
[1:58:01] john 19.
[1:58:06] verse 13
[1:58:16] when pilate therefore heard that saying
[1:58:17] he brought jesus forth and sat down in
[1:58:19] the judgment seat
[1:58:21] and the place which is called the
[1:58:22] pavement but in the hebrew
[1:58:24] gobatha and it was the preparation of
[1:58:27] the passover
[1:58:28] and about the sixth hour
[1:58:33] when was it six hour what does he do in
[1:58:36] the sixth hour
[1:58:37] he saith unto jews behold your king
[1:58:42] he reveals the seventh seal in the sixth
[1:58:48] why why did pilate do it in the sixth
[1:58:51] hour
[1:58:53] why did boaz give six measures of barley
[1:58:57] why did this little harlot have six
[1:59:00] husbands
[1:59:02] you know it probably bothered her for
[1:59:04] the rest of her days as a believer
[1:59:05] that i had gotten that sinful condition
[1:59:08] how could i have done it lord
[1:59:09] how could i have come to the sixth
[1:59:10] husband and little did she know
[1:59:14] little did she know that there was a
[1:59:16] purpose for the eternal word of god
[1:59:19] for her to come to this condition
[1:59:22] abraham no doubt abraham would have
[1:59:24] mourned
[1:59:25] saying why did i go to gerar why why
[1:59:28] would i have been
[1:59:28] such a yellow yellow belly not to defend
[1:59:31] my wife why did i even do those things
[1:59:34] little does he know 4 000 years later
[1:59:37] there's going to be a prophet on the
[1:59:38] scene
[1:59:38] who's going to pick up that story he's
[1:59:40] going to say see
[1:59:42] sarah and abraham had a body change
[1:59:45] because now the king of gerard wants to
[1:59:47] marry grandma he could have any fair
[1:59:49] young virgin and now
[1:59:50] he wants grandma and you know if if
[1:59:52] abraham had
[1:59:53] not failed if abraham had not left the
[1:59:56] land if abraham had not made a mistake
[1:59:58] there would be nothing for the prophet
[2:00:00] to point to to prove a body change
[2:00:02] if that little harlot had not come into
[2:00:04] adultery amen to the sixth husband
[2:00:09] we wouldn't realize that there's the
[2:00:11] seventh seal
[2:00:12] and if she's supposed to get married why
[2:00:15] did pilate bring him out
[2:00:16] at the sixth hour the word of god is
[2:00:19] directing everything you see
[2:00:21] everything in politics everything in
[2:00:23] finances is being directed by the word
[2:00:26] of god
[2:00:26] and who can resist his will it's already
[2:00:29] in the word you want to know why we're
[2:00:31] in the economic condition we're in
[2:00:32] you just look at the at the third seal
[2:00:36] it tells you where we're at you look at
[2:00:37] the trumpets they tell you where we're
[2:00:39] at it's already written in the word
[2:00:42] why because when it was time why is
[2:00:45] economics going the way it is why
[2:00:47] are we moving into this to this position
[2:00:49] that we're moving in
[2:00:52] why because when it was time for jesus
[2:00:55] to be born
[2:00:56] there was a taxation on the whole world
[2:00:59] the pattern is already set
[2:01:04] who moved who moved mary and joseph to
[2:01:07] bethlehem
[2:01:09] that wasn't reasoning it was a decree
[2:01:12] from caesar
[2:01:14] it was a decree from caesar that moved
[2:01:17] them to bethlehem
[2:01:19] why because an economic pressure came on
[2:01:22] the whole world
[2:01:23] and now there's laws written that are
[2:01:25] moving them where oh i can imagine
[2:01:27] joseph going down saying this stupid
[2:01:29] caesar and these dumb laws and
[2:01:31] i hate these taxes and why do we have to
[2:01:33] go
[2:01:35] and every step he's taking is being
[2:01:37] ordained by prophecy
[2:01:39] the word of god is moving his every move
[2:01:42] is being moved by the word of god
[2:01:44] why are we coming into a one world order
[2:01:48] because it's time for him to be birthed
[2:01:49] again why is economic pressure coming
[2:01:52] it's time for him to be birthed again
[2:01:54] it's already been written in the word
[2:01:56] the pattern is set now it's coming
[2:02:01] it's all taking place in the sixth day
[2:02:03] because nothing's in the seventh
[2:02:06] the seventh is a person now get this
[2:02:12] verse 14. it was the preparation of the
[2:02:15] passover about the sixth hour
[2:02:17] and he sayeth unto the jews behold your
[2:02:20] king
[2:02:21] and they cried out away with him away
[2:02:23] with him crucify him
[2:02:24] pilate said to them shall i crucify your
[2:02:26] king the chief priest answered we have
[2:02:29] no king but the pope
[2:02:34] will take the system we don't want your
[2:02:37] revealed word
[2:02:38] we don't want your seventh seal we don't
[2:02:40] want your crisis the mystery of god
[2:02:42] revealed
[2:02:43] we have no king but the system
[2:02:48] the pattern's done been set brothers and
[2:02:50] sisters that's why brother branham could
[2:02:52] come
[2:02:52] under the sixth steel in the sixth day
[2:02:55] being a man number six
[2:02:56] and he could reveal this scripture right
[2:02:58] here
[2:03:01] behold your king away with him
[2:03:04] crucify him so brother could come back
[2:03:06] and preach i indict this generation
[2:03:09] for what the second crucifixion of jesus
[2:03:12] christ
[2:03:13] why the king had been presented and they
[2:03:15] wanted the system
[2:03:17] what was caesar the system
[2:03:20] caesar was the pope at the top of the
[2:03:22] world system
[2:03:24] and today you take somebody the word of
[2:03:26] god and you say this is the king
[2:03:28] this is christ this is how a woman ought
[2:03:30] to live this is how a man ought to live
[2:03:32] this is what's godly this is what's holy
[2:03:34] this is a prophet and they say i don't
[2:03:36] want your king
[2:03:39] away with your king away with the man
[2:03:43] and every day they're crucifying afresh
[2:03:46] the lord of glory
[2:03:47] and they've already been indicted for it
[2:03:49] and now what is happening is the
[2:03:51] scriptural pattern is repeating in your
[2:03:53] life
[2:03:54] you say what's happening to me i just
[2:03:56] told them about the word and now they're
[2:03:58] rejecting and they're angry
[2:03:59] and it almost would kill it
[2:04:02] they almost would kill me what's
[2:04:04] happening the word is directing your
[2:04:06] life
[2:04:07] the word is directing their life the
[2:04:10] hatred for the word is already in the
[2:04:12] word
[2:04:14] everything is laying in the scriptures
[2:04:17] and everything that's happening
[2:04:19] every moment of the day is the
[2:04:20] scriptures being fleshed out
[2:04:23] on the good and the evil the antichrist
[2:04:25] system and the crisis
[2:04:26] what is it it's all ordained it is all
[2:04:29] written and it is all moving in step
[2:04:32] with this word right here
[2:04:36] i think it's time to lay down all other
[2:04:38] books
[2:04:41] your financial planning book is not
[2:04:43] going to get you anywhere
[2:04:45] because there's going to be a worldwide
[2:04:47] taxation
[2:04:49] what are you saving up money for the
[2:04:51] beast for
[2:04:55] this is my financial plan
[2:04:58] i'll show you financial planning in the
[2:05:00] bible
[2:05:02] abraham did the most unreasonable thing
[2:05:04] you could do for your future
[2:05:06] financial welfare he left his father's
[2:05:08] home his father's business
[2:05:10] he left his home he left everything that
[2:05:12] he acquired him and his wife
[2:05:14] they went out to a strange land to be a
[2:05:16] stranger in a strange land
[2:05:18] what if i come to you and say leave your
[2:05:20] occupation leave your work leave your
[2:05:21] father leave
[2:05:22] everything you know and go be a stranger
[2:05:24] in a strange land
[2:05:26] he was destined for poverty but several
[2:05:30] years later you find him with enough
[2:05:31] wealth
[2:05:32] he has enough servants born in his house
[2:05:34] that he can amass an army that can go
[2:05:36] defeat the kings
[2:05:37] that just defeated sodom and gomorrah
[2:05:40] that's
[2:05:40] economic planning you want to plan for
[2:05:44] the future
[2:05:44] you give god your every single moment
[2:05:47] and you let the lord
[2:05:48] direct your every single step and your
[2:05:50] future will be secure
[2:05:54] hallelujah it's in the word
[2:05:57] live the word you want to see
[2:06:00] there's all kinds of financial planning
[2:06:02] in the bible
[2:06:03] isaac planted during a famine
[2:06:10] when everybody else lost faith didn't
[2:06:13] believe it would work
[2:06:15] there's no water how am i going to water
[2:06:17] this seed
[2:06:18] just stick it in the ground you know god
[2:06:21] will take care of it
[2:06:23] and in the famine he produced a harvest
[2:06:26] and when everybody else was hungry
[2:06:27] he had grain what am i saying
[2:06:31] it's all the word it's time for the word
[2:06:35] or nothing
[2:06:38] not men's books of wisdom not
[2:06:41] man's best ideas what the not what the
[2:06:44] news outlet is telling you
[2:06:46] not what the experts of the day say
[2:06:50] because the experts of today will be the
[2:06:52] fools of tomorrow
[2:06:54] because the experts of 1970 look
[2:06:57] ridiculous
[2:06:58] today
[2:07:02] experts predict and later good job
[2:07:06] you got it wrong 100 percent of the time
[2:07:12] with human reasoning
[2:07:15] the sixth day the seventh is revealed
[2:07:17] and the seventh seal
[2:07:18] is not a thing it's a person
[2:07:21] and this is the record of the seventh
[2:07:23] seal this is the story of my life
[2:07:26] i'm an eternal being this is the eternal
[2:07:28] word this is the same thing that i am
[2:07:33] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[2:07:37] every word that proceedeth out of the
[2:07:40] mouth of god
[2:07:42] what's this every word
[2:07:45] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[2:07:48] this all is recorded and has come out of
[2:07:51] the mouth of god
[2:07:53] and we're not to live by reasoning we're
[2:07:55] not to live by education
[2:07:57] we're to live by the word
[2:08:00] faith civilization lives by
[2:08:04] it is written
[2:08:08] jesus winds up in the desert all alone
[2:08:11] led there by the holy ghost and he comes
[2:08:12] under attack by satan himself
[2:08:16] he's defenseless he's weaponless he has
[2:08:18] no goods
[2:08:19] he has nothing just in the wilderness 40
[2:08:22] days
[2:08:23] when his body's in a weakened condition
[2:08:25] after fasting 40 days
[2:08:27] being weak in body no doubt the human
[2:08:29] part of the mind is troubled
[2:08:31] things are not working out right now the
[2:08:33] devil comes to him to try him in a
[2:08:35] weakened condition
[2:08:39] and the devil tries his first attack and
[2:08:42] he says
[2:08:42] it is written he tries his second attack
[2:08:47] he says it is written now he comes for
[2:08:49] the third attack
[2:08:51] and on his third attack jesus surely
[2:08:53] he's going to pull out a secret weapon
[2:08:55] he's going to do a judo chop something
[2:09:00] he gets to the third test and he says
[2:09:03] it is written what has he done
[2:09:06] he's left the example for us
[2:09:09] what was he the seventh seal on display
[2:09:12] when was he christ
[2:09:14] what are we the seven sea on display
[2:09:17] what are we christ and we are supposed
[2:09:19] to live
[2:09:20] the same way he lived we're supposed to
[2:09:23] defeat the devil the same way he
[2:09:24] defeated the devil
[2:09:26] this is our life this is everything to
[2:09:30] us
[2:09:31] brother brenham didn't come to add to
[2:09:32] this or take away from it
[2:09:34] he came to point us back to it
[2:09:37] he said we have no book but the
[2:09:42] amen i say that's good advice
[2:09:46] let's all stand musicians if you'd like
[2:09:48] to come
[2:09:56] i just want to say we stand here in the
[2:10:00] sixth hour
[2:10:03] we're in the sixth day since the fall of
[2:10:06] man
[2:10:07] the six thousandth year we are the
[2:10:10] number six because man
[2:10:11] is six here we stand
[2:10:15] and i can say to you this revealed word
[2:10:19] this open book this is your king
[2:10:24] behold i have spoken about your king
[2:10:28] today now the choice is yours
[2:10:32] what will be your response will you bow
[2:10:34] down and worship the king
[2:10:36] or will you say away with him we have no
[2:10:39] king
[2:10:40] but the system you may not say those
[2:10:43] words but your actions will absolutely
[2:10:45] dictate what you do with this
[2:10:47] jesus called christ
[2:10:50] when you're presented so clearly with
[2:10:53] the word today
[2:10:54] when you see the scriptures are alive
[2:10:56] and the book is
[2:10:57] open and it's nothing more than christ
[2:11:00] the revelation of god the mystery of god
[2:11:04] revealed is christ now an open word an
[2:11:08] open book and it's presented before you
[2:11:10] behold your king
[2:11:13] now we get to decide not by the words
[2:11:15] that we speak but by the life that we
[2:11:17] live
[2:11:18] whether or not we're choosing to bow
[2:11:20] down to this king and take him as our
[2:11:22] king
[2:11:22] or whether we're going to take the
[2:11:23] system as our king
[2:11:26] and every day we get to make this choice
[2:11:28] in every choice we get to make
[2:11:30] are we going to have the king are we
[2:11:32] going to have the system
[2:11:35] and i say god forgive me forgive me
[2:11:39] i have relied on my own mind or my own
[2:11:42] reasoning
[2:11:42] i have relied on decision making
[2:11:46] god forgive me lord open my eyes to see
[2:11:50] your word
[2:11:51] like i've never seen it before let me
[2:11:54] see it as the solution to every need i
[2:11:56] have
[2:11:56] let me see it as meeting the day that i
[2:11:58] live and let it see
[2:11:59] as the directing beam that directs my
[2:12:01] life lord let me see your word for today
[2:12:05] take the scales off of my eyes god wash
[2:12:08] my eyes clean give me crystal clear
[2:12:10] vision so that i can see this word
[2:12:13] alive today everything we have need of
[2:12:17] god take it out of your word
[2:12:19] and give it to us how many agrees that's
[2:12:22] what you want
[2:12:24] and i say the first thing we have to do
[2:12:26] is say god forgive me
[2:12:29] god forgive me so many messes i've
[2:12:32] gotten is because i use my mind
[2:12:35] my memory my reasoning my affection
[2:12:38] but i don't want to use that i want to
[2:12:40] use christ's memory christ
[2:12:42] reasoning christ affection we have the
[2:12:45] mind of christ
[2:12:46] the scripture says let this mind
[2:12:50] be in you allow permit this mind to be
[2:12:54] in you that was in christ
[2:12:56] and i say lord let this mind be in me
[2:13:00] i surrender god let's just pray dear
[2:13:03] heavenly father
[2:13:04] you know our hearts lord you know we're
[2:13:07] standing here lord and
[2:13:09] just quivering lord because your
[2:13:11] revelation is so real in this hour
[2:13:14] lord this is not bible verses lord
[2:13:18] these are not slogans or cliches or
[2:13:20] sayings lord
[2:13:22] this is reality we have come to the time
[2:13:26] knowing that christ is being presented
[2:13:28] to the world
[2:13:29] lord we've come to the sixth hour
[2:13:33] we've come to the sixth day we've come
[2:13:36] under the sixth seal
[2:13:38] we're under the sixth trumpet we're
[2:13:40] standing at the moment lord
[2:13:43] when the world is choosing lord you said
[2:13:46] in your word
[2:13:48] choose you this day whom you will serve
[2:13:52] but as for me and my house we will serve
[2:13:56] the lord
[2:13:58] god i pray that you would help us to
[2:13:59] forsake everything else lord
[2:14:02] all other thinking lord all of their
[2:14:04] ideas of man
[2:14:06] man all mixed ideas of denominational
[2:14:09] systems lord
[2:14:10] let us purge that out of our minds now
[2:14:13] wash us lord
[2:14:14] wash us by the water of your word and
[2:14:16] help us lord to see the word for our
[2:14:18] condition
[2:14:19] help us to see the word for the day we
[2:14:21] live in for every obstacle give us your
[2:14:23] word
[2:14:24] lord when you were here you showed us
[2:14:25] how to defeat the devil and lord you
[2:14:27] didn't
[2:14:28] quote memorize bible verses you were the
[2:14:30] word and you just spoke the word lord
[2:14:33] you spoke what had already been written
[2:14:35] lord and that's how you defeated the
[2:14:37] devil
[2:14:38] showing us that we will defeat him today
[2:14:40] by speaking what has already been
[2:14:43] written in your word
[2:14:46] does not the word say god let that be
[2:14:49] our favorite line
[2:14:51] let that be the word is spoken most
[2:14:53] across our lips
[2:14:54] does not the word say give us a firm
[2:14:58] foundation to anchor our faith lord
[2:15:00] take us to higher heights lord draw us
[2:15:03] into your word in
[2:15:04] deeper realms we give ourselves
[2:15:06] completely to you almighty
[2:15:08] god forgive us for our failures in the
[2:15:10] past and lord open our eyes
[2:15:12] wash them with your eyes that we might
[2:15:15] see
[2:15:16] we give you our life we trust in you
[2:15:19] pray to take us lord
[2:15:21] move us lord by your word direct our
[2:15:24] every step and thought by your
[2:15:26] scriptures
[2:15:27] we ask it in jesus christ's name amen
[2:15:31] god bless you saints i just want to say
[2:15:35] i love you
[2:15:37] god is doing something
[2:15:41] god is washing away all of the old
[2:15:45] all of the ideas i tell you
[2:15:49] we have mixed denominational thinking
[2:15:51] with the message
[2:15:53] every one of us have done it who's born
[2:15:55] and raised in denomination
[2:15:57] the culture has denominational thinking
[2:16:00] and we have mixed the word we didn't do
[2:16:03] it on purpose we didn't do it because we
[2:16:05] were evil people
[2:16:06] but we did it because we used our
[2:16:08] reasoning
[2:16:10] and i say god does not want his word
[2:16:12] mixed
[2:16:13] he wants this word left pure
[2:16:17] not to try to figure it out to believe
[2:16:19] it and to watch it made manifest
[2:16:22] i'm far beyond mixing
[2:16:25] i'm so tired of a watered down gospel
[2:16:29] that's not working
[2:16:30] and it's not because the gospel doesn't
[2:16:32] work it's because we have
[2:16:33] mixed our own reasoning with the message
[2:16:37] and say well that i tried that it
[2:16:38] doesn't work there's nothing wrong with
[2:16:40] this word
[2:16:42] let me repeat that there's nothing wrong
[2:16:44] with this word
[2:16:46] everything you need of is in the word
[2:16:49] everything you can overcome with is in
[2:16:51] the word
[2:16:52] every weapon every tool every building
[2:16:55] stone is in this word
[2:16:58] don't even hint that it doesn't work the
[2:17:01] problem
[2:17:02] is here and we need to take this word
[2:17:06] from a heart of faith and speak in lips
[2:17:09] of faith
[2:17:10] and watch deity move the situation
[2:17:16] we've got to come back to the word and
[2:17:18] the word
[2:17:19] only not our interpretation
[2:17:24] what did the messenger tell us say what
[2:17:27] the tapes say
[2:17:30] but it doesn't seem to make sense if i
[2:17:32] would just turn his words from here to
[2:17:34] here it'd make more sense
[2:17:35] say what the tapes say
[2:17:39] if it doesn't seem to add up the problem
[2:17:41] is not with the prophet
[2:17:44] the problem is not with the message the
[2:17:46] problem is with this
[2:17:48] and we need to say god i want more of
[2:17:50] the mind of christ
[2:17:52] i want more of the proper understanding
[2:17:54] give me more of this book
[2:17:56] oh i'm telling you when we start
[2:17:58] preaching like this is saying why would
[2:18:00] i read
[2:18:00] anything but my bible why would i get
[2:18:04] caught up
[2:18:05] in all this stuff that's out there on
[2:18:08] these shelves i want to have a better
[2:18:10] marriage
[2:18:11] so i'll go to the marriage section in
[2:18:12] the bookstore
[2:18:14] i'm so glad they closed down our
[2:18:15] bookstore
[2:18:18] you know how many people in christian
[2:18:20] churches
[2:18:21] are reading all of them books on that
[2:18:22] bookstore and having horrible marriages
[2:18:26] it hasn't solved one of their problems
[2:18:28] and if it has solved the problem it's
[2:18:29] because they're using reasoning
[2:18:31] and they have a strong willpower and
[2:18:33] they've got a formula and it brings a
[2:18:34] measure of success
[2:18:36] i don't want that kind of success this
[2:18:39] we've already been given everything
[2:18:43] forget all of that stuff we don't need a
[2:18:45] book about raising children a book about
[2:18:48] parenting a book about all this stuff we
[2:18:50] just need the word
[2:18:52] every book should talk about the word
[2:18:54] everything should be pointing to the
[2:18:56] scriptures
[2:18:58] we've got everything we need
[2:19:02] quit looking for solutions to our
[2:19:04] problems
[2:19:06] outside of the revealed word
[2:19:09] why would god give us a bible that's
[2:19:12] perfect and eternal
[2:19:14] and say okay since you won't get it or
[2:19:17] understand it or make it work
[2:19:18] you've got to mix it with reasoning and
[2:19:20] spit out
[2:19:22] please this works
[2:19:25] if it's not working in your life get on
[2:19:27] your knees and repent
[2:19:29] say lord there's something wrong with me
[2:19:30] because your words not failed
[2:19:32] give me the mind of christ give me the
[2:19:34] proper understanding
[2:19:35] let me see your word and let me put it
[2:19:37] in application and watch demons run away
[2:19:40] from my life
[2:19:42] watch overcoming begin to take place why
[2:19:44] all i'm doing is what jesus did
[2:19:47] i'm just talking like him all i'm doing
[2:19:49] is what i saw the prophet do
[2:19:51] take the word and apply it take the word
[2:19:53] and apply it take the word and apply it
[2:19:56] and it will work hallelujah
[2:20:00] let's sing something brother randy you

[2:22:40] evening and then we'll go right in
[2:22:42] to communion it's going to say
[2:22:46] god's called us not to a church life
[2:22:50] he's called us to a spirit life
[2:22:53] to a life of faith to a life that will
[2:22:56] match
[2:22:57] the original faith of the original
[2:22:59] pentecostal fathers
[2:23:02] that's the life that he's called us to
[2:23:04] that's the life that i want to live
[2:23:07] no more playing games with his word no
[2:23:10] more
[2:23:10] no more playing around with the things
[2:23:12] that he's told us
[2:23:14] it's time to be fully committed fully in
[2:23:17] full revelation of the word i also want

[2:23:46] prison they were having a prayer
[2:23:49] meeting brother branham told us and all
[2:23:52] of a sudden
[2:23:53] an angel comes and rescues peter and the
[2:23:55] doors open and leads him out
[2:23:57] and it's so supernatural and he comes
[2:24:00] and he knocks on the very door where
[2:24:01] they're having the prayer meeting
[2:24:05] that's the way you should pray you
