========================================

man wants to put his effort towards something but every time man puts his effort towards something he ruins it amen and it's god it doesn't want us to put our effort towards something he wants us to surrender to something and it was his will now don't don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have any effort we do the word of god we sacrifice we give up we we obey we do what he called us to do but at the end of the day what can you do amen what what work are you able to work what thing what can you do what power do you have what will your little hands and your little body what will it do they meant nothing but surrender to the will of god it's the will of god that'll bring the victory remember jesus is our example he goes to win the battle he goes to bring victory he goes to release us from bondage he goes to to break the power of the enemy by hybridization he goes to shed his precious blood amen as a perfect slain lamb to free us from the curse and there's nothing he can do there's nothing he can add to it there's no effort he can put into it he just has to completely surrender and let god do what god already ordained that god would do he wouldn't even speak at his trial you think of the wisdom of solomon but he said a greater than solomon is here the wisest of the wisest was standing there on trial amen and the trial was a dog and pony show and it was an absolute ridiculous trial and do you think that jesus with a few phrases couldn't have unraveled the whole thing he couldn't have made pilate ashamed of himself he couldn't have made canvases in the high priest tucked their tails and those who were speaking against him run away and hide with just a few phrases he could have discerned the whole thing he had more wisdom than solomon had amen a greater than solomon was standing on trial amen and it wasn't his wisdom that was going to win the day it wasn't words it wasn't discernment it wasn't anything that was going to win the victory he had to close his mouth and completely surrender and let god do it amen this was god's victory man this was god's doing amen but god couldn't do it without a human being god has so set his plan that he doesn't do anything without you and i he needs a man to work through amen but he didn't need this man to do anything he needed this man to say thy will be done not mine [Music] that's the kind of man he needed for the greatest victory amen for the for the destruction of satan for the overcoming amen of the fall he needed a man that wouldn't put his own effort into it amen when he wouldn't use his own mind that wouldn't even use his gifts for the greatest victory he needed a man that will stand and be quiet and surrender and let god have his way
