TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and all around the bride amen god is manifesting his word but life is just going on but it won't always just go on like that it'll come to an abrupt stop judgment is here judgment is upon the earth and god has provided a place and that place is in christ jesus it's the only ark of safety and there's a bride here who is working and laboring in that word in that ark of safety christ the revealed word of the hour and she's laboring in it she's giving it out she's manifesting she's living it amen so that others can see this is the ark come into it it's the message of the hour it's christ our lord it's your bridegroom it's your husband the revealed word and we're laboring in it how are we preaching are we all preachers of righteousness how are we preaching we're preaching by building the ark noah was preaching by taking the lumber making boards nailing them pitching them like the lord told him what was he doing he was preaching the gospel by living the manifestation of the word and when god through a prophetic gift has come and told us what what the bible says about our conduct our dress our attitude our action our faith our doctrine amen when we take all of that and we materialize it through a daily life it's the same thing as noah nailing another board on the wall when we refuse to go along with everybody at work that is cheating the company out of money but we say that's not honest amen that wouldn't be pleasing to my lord what are you doing you're nailing another board on the ark when a woman refuses to take the fashions of the day amen even if it causes her to be looked at or scoring but she stays with the revealed word of the hour on how she dresses and how she acts when she refuses to cut her hair when she refuses to put on makeup amen what is she doing she's nailing another board on the ark when a man will live selfless for his family and he'll bring up his children in the fear and admonition of the lord what's he doing he's nailing another border on the ark when a woman will faithfully reverence her husband and serve him as unto the lord what's she doing she's nailing another board on the ark so that this world will be without excuse just as the world in that day was without excuse because there was a man there who told him the truth and he manifest his faith in that truth before them and there's a people on the earth today that not just believes the word but they take the word and they manifest that word to everybody around them and their conduct their attitude their temperament their speech their dress amen in every way in every facet of life they bring that body they bring it subject to the word and when they bring it subject to the word what are they doing they're being a preacher of righteousness because this message of this hour is the ark of safety
