[0:00] now on easter morning there was another
[0:02] light struck the earth
[0:03] when the holy spirit was given and it's
[0:05] given to bring life to those seeds that
[0:06] god by his foreknowledge
[0:08] knew that would be here on the earth as
[0:10] he knew the first natural seed he knows
[0:12] where the spiritual seed is
[0:14] your body was laying here right then on
[0:16] the earth when god
[0:18] first brought the earth into existence
[0:20] my goodness
[0:21] if god laid the elements for your body
[0:24] knowing that
[0:25] down the road he would need these
[0:27] elements to make your body
[0:28] when something begins to happen to your
[0:30] body why don't we turn to the one who
[0:32] laid the elements here before the
[0:34] foundation of the world
[0:35] and say god i need help with this body
[0:38] you lay the elements out here like he
[0:40] says like a great contractor he lays it
[0:42] all out
[0:42] he knows he's going to be building in
[0:44] each stage that he's going to build
[0:45] until he gets to completion and he lays
[0:47] all his material out
[0:48] and the material for your flesh body was
[0:50] laid here when he first formed the world
[0:53] and if you're having problems with your
[0:55] flesh body with the material that was
[0:57] laid here turned to the one who laid it
[0:59] here
[0:59] and had a plan for it and still has a
[1:02] plan today
[1:03] and say god this is the situation but i
[1:05] know you laid these elements on this
[1:07] earth to form this body
[1:08] to manifest your glory in this day and
[1:10] i'm asking you to do your work in me
[1:12] today
[1:15] see the devil tries he's trying to make
[1:17] us afraid because when we're afraid
[1:19] amen we begin to get nervous and we turn
[1:21] our eyes from the promise and we begin
[1:22] to doubt we begin to question
[1:24] amen and that's not how god fulfills his
[1:26] word he fulfills his word
[1:28] by giving us a faith to believe his word
[1:30] because the word of god operates by
[1:31] faith
[1:33] so the devil is trying distractions and
[1:35] fear tactics and anxiety
[1:37] and i say turn back to the one who knew
[1:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:42] and said god you knew i would be here
[1:44] you knew i would have a need you
[1:46] provided a lamb slain from before the
[1:48] foundation of the world to meet this
[1:49] need and i'm trusting in you to meet the
[1:52] need
[1:52] and then forget about it
