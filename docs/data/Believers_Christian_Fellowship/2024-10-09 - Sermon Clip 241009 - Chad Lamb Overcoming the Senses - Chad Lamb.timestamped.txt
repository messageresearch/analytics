[0:00] it didn't have the feel it didn't have
[0:02] the click it didn't seem to hit and I'll
[0:05] go home in Despair and I'll go home but
[0:08] I know the word was
[0:09] true it wasn't we were preaching false
[0:11] it was the message we read the quotes we
[0:13] read the script we knew it was the truth
[0:15] but somehow for me it just felt flat
[0:18] inevitably those are the service I get
[0:20] the most text messages where somebody
[0:22] said that was exactly for me that was
[0:24] the conversation we had on the way to
[0:26] church that was what I talked to my
[0:27] coworker about and I said oh God I'm
[0:29] sorry sorry God's trying to wean me off
[0:31] of feelings it doesn't matter how I feel
[0:34] while I preach if I don't deliver the
[0:36] word it doesn't do anything amen but if
[0:39] we can deliver the word and if I feel
[0:41] good praise God if I don't feel good
[0:42] praise God as long as the word is being
[0:45] preached it'll affect the lives of God's
[0:47] children cuz the word Works anywhere
[0:51] anytime under any condition and it never
[0:55] fails so if everybody's standing on
[0:57] their feet and waving their arms it'll
[0:59] work if it's the word if they're
[1:00] standing on the feet and waving their
[1:02] arms if it's some intellectual talk if
[1:04] it's some psychology some feel-good
[1:06] something it's not going to do anything
[1:08] but if everybody's sitting in their
[1:09] seats writing down notes Whispering an
[1:11] amen and if it's the word they'll go
[1:13] home delivered if they believe that
[1:16] word amen we got to wean ourselves off
[1:19] of feelings I love the feelings let's
[1:21] have them every service but if we don't
[1:23] have them don't call it a failure if
[1:24] it's the preaching of the word it can't
[1:26] fail the word Can't Fail amen amen so we
[1:31] got to we got to get weaned off of these
[1:34] feelings where one service that was a
[1:37] good
[1:38] service what was good about it it just
[1:40] had that that
[1:45] feeling that service wasn't any good why
[1:47] wasn't it good I don't know the things
[1:50] he were saying just kind of stepped on
[1:52] my toes and I left not feeling
[1:58] good the question and how you felt the
[2:00] question is was it the
[2:02] word whether you felt condemned attacked
[2:04] convicted whether you felt exalted
[2:07] whether you felt lifted up whether you
[2:08] felt whatever you felt it doesn't matter
[2:11] what you felt the question is was it the
[2:14] word we got to get weaned off of
[2:16] feelings and get back to the word it's
[2:18] the word it's the word it's the word
[2:20] what was brother brandham emphasizing
[2:21] over and over what was the third pull it
[2:24] was the opening of the word I mean what
[2:25] was the climax of his mystery it was the
[2:27] revealing of the word it's all the word
[2:29] friends what did he how did Christ come
[2:31] to us in this age he came as the
[2:33] revealed word right how did he Unite
[2:35] with his bride what was the headship the
[2:37] headship was the headship of the word
[2:38] that had come back it's the word that
[2:40] we're looking for not feelings feelings
[2:43] will come feelings will go as long as
[2:45] we're in the flesh feelings will be all
[2:46] over the place but the word will never
[2:50] change God give me the strength to say
[2:53] Amen to the word when everything in me
[2:55] feels like crawling in a hole and dying
[2:57] I want to say Amen the word still the
[2:59] truth yes
