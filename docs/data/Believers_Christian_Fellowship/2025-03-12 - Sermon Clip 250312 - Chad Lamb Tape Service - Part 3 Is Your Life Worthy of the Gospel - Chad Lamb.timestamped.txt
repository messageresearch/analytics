[0:00] and I've enjoyed listening to another
[0:03] tape and have another tape service with
[0:04] you it's always a blessing every year I
[0:06] said we're going to do this more than
[0:07] once but you know how it goes we flip
[0:10] months on the calendar like like we flip
[0:12] weeks you know but I thank God that we
[0:14] had this time together and I enjoyed it
[0:16] and if there's anything that this can do
[0:18] the the the purpose behind all of this
[0:20] is to enjoy this together and learn how
[0:23] to dig into the word to to eat from the
[0:25] word not to just listen and read
[0:27] casually but to to take the meat for our
[0:29] day to give us spiritual strength and if
[0:31] I can do anything if God gives me any
[0:34] influence or ability over you all it
[0:36] would be to instill into you a hunger
[0:37] and a desire to read the message for
[0:39] yourselves every child and young person
[0:42] of every age you're only going to be as
[0:44] strong as the amount of good nutritious
[0:46] food you eat and we spend so much time
[0:50] in this world bombarded by other things
[0:52] that we have to partake of and we have
[0:54] to as we mingle with the world there's
[0:56] so many things that are coming in that
[0:57] is not nutritious food that will not
[1:00] give us spiritual strength to fly amen
[1:04] we we've got to gain strength from the
[1:06] word we've got to read the Bibles
[1:07] ourselves we got to read the message
[1:09] ourselves we got to ask God to give us
[1:11] open eyes to see and to hear open our
[1:14] ears and open our eyes that we can feed
[1:16] on the word
[1:17] ourselves so I hope you love the word
[1:20] and I hope you feed on the word daily to
[1:23] have spiritual strength this last leg of
[1:27] the journey is going to require all the
[1:29] vitamins of the whole Bible That's why
[1:30] God took the took the veil off the Bible
[1:32] and gave us the full word because this
[1:35] last leg of the journey to fly clear on
[1:37] out of this Dimension is going to
[1:38] require all the spiritual vitamins
[1:40] that's available that's why we have a
[1:43] four full seven course menu brother bam
[1:47] said for this end time take advantage of
[1:50] it I I encourage you God bless you
