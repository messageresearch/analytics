[14:12] amen
[14:14] she was sweet she just stared at me the
[14:16] whole time
[14:17] I don't know if she was frightened or
[14:19] mesmerized or what she did good
[14:22] it's uh while we're standing let's look
[14:24] into our Bibles in The Book of Leviticus
[14:26] and we'll begin there
[14:27] I want to let you know that brother
[14:29] Emmanuel sebasa was preaching for
[14:31] brother Burley Williams this morning so
[14:33] we want to pray for him and that wasn't
[14:35] really intended to be that way he was
[14:37] just going down to visit a friend that
[14:39] attends there and brother Burley got
[14:41] asked to take services and he heard
[14:43] through the grapevine that brother
[14:44] Emmanuel was coming so he tapped him
[14:46] last minute so brother Manuel thought he
[14:48] was going to visit friends and now he's
[14:50] preaching amen so we want to remember
[14:52] him this morning and also that they have
[14:54] traveling mercies coming home
[14:56] I just want to say I enjoyed the trip
[14:58] report Wednesday it was really nice to
[15:01] see what the Lord is doing and it was
[15:02] great to be on that trip amen and I
[15:05] preached eight services in just eight
[15:08] days and that's more than a month's
[15:10] worth of services and so I was really
[15:13] thankful Caleb or Kyle agreed to take
[15:15] the service because it gave me a little
[15:17] break and so I know he was tired too he
[15:19] was as tired as I was but I appreciate
[15:21] him stepping and doing that it was
[15:23] really nice it was wonderful and he was
[15:25] telling you at that service kind of how
[15:27] that came about some of the thoughts
[15:29] that he shared there was the capping off
[15:31] of a sermon that we had preached
[15:33] together I preached and he was supposed
[15:34] to preach the beginning but he ended up
[15:36] coming at the end and so I just felt in
[15:39] my heart to preach that sermon this
[15:41] morning so which is the sermon I
[15:43] preached last Sunday brother Danny Del
[15:45] Mundo's anniversary meetings so Brother
[15:47] Kyle you did get to set it off this time
[15:49] amen we went in the right order he went
[15:51] first and now I'll come so now we got it
[15:53] we got it arranged correctly
[15:55] amen so this morning I'd like to preach
[15:57] on the wave Chief is our example
[16:00] and let's begin in Leviticus 23 verse 9.
[16:09] Leviticus 23 and verse 9 and the Lord
[16:13] spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[16:15] children of Israel and saying to them
[16:17] when you become into the land which I
[16:19] give unto you and shall reap the Harvest
[16:21] thereof then you shall bring a Sheaf of
[16:23] the firstfruits of your Harvest unto the
[16:25] priest and he shall wave the Sheaf
[16:28] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[16:31] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[16:34] priest shall wave it may God bless you
[16:36] as you take your seats
[16:39] amen I want to say welcome to Sister
[16:42] Paula Taylor God bless you it's good to
[16:44] have you in service with us it's been a
[16:46] while since we've seen you so it's good
[16:48] to have you here any other visitors
[16:49] you're more than welcome and say God
[16:51] bless you as well
[16:52] amen when we look at this subject we
[16:54] have talked about the wave Chief before
[16:57] but this is a thought that dropped into
[16:58] my heart several weeks before I left for
[17:00] the Philippines and I started meditating
[17:03] on it and working on it but so for the
[17:05] title is the wave Chief is our example
[17:07] and I want to read a couple quotes out
[17:09] of it is the rising of the sun to set
[17:11] the basis for the service this morning
[17:14] brother Manningham is referring to the
[17:16] wave Chief offering here that we just
[17:18] read out of Leviticus it was an order
[17:20] that was given to Moses to give to the
[17:24] children of Israel that when they come
[17:26] into their land amen and they begin to
[17:28] before they harvest their fruits they're
[17:31] supposed to take the first part of the
[17:33] Harvest the first part that comes the
[17:35] maturity and they're supposed to cut a
[17:37] Sheaf off of that and take it to the
[17:39] priests and the priest is to wave it
[17:40] before the Lord and this is very
[17:43] symbolic because it's symbolizing a
[17:45] thankfulness to the Lord amen for
[17:47] bringing another Harvest but they're
[17:49] also taking the first part of the field
[17:52] that came to harvest maturity amen and
[17:55] they're waving it it's also symbolizing
[17:57] that they're trusting God the same God
[17:59] who brought this to maturity will bring
[18:01] the whole field to maturity
[18:03] so it's it's a Thanksgiving but it's
[18:05] also a testimony amen it's a sign that
[18:08] God is going to continue the work and
[18:10] that they're going to have another
[18:11] Harvest and so this was instituted by
[18:14] God given to Moses Moses give it to the
[18:17] Levites and it was an order that was
[18:18] kept and brother Branham picks up on
[18:20] this and the message it is the rising of
[18:22] the sun he says notice it was the first
[18:25] corn of God's wheat that had been raised
[18:27] from the dead God's first corn of wheat
[18:29] now he's speaking of Jesus Christ so
[18:31] brother Brahm is taking it to spiritual
[18:32] times now the first Corner Wheat by
[18:35] God's quickening power God had quickened
[18:37] his life raised him up from the dead and
[18:39] he was the first fruits of those that
[18:41] slept the first fruit he was the Sheaf
[18:44] that's why they had to wave the Sheaf or
[18:47] it was the first one that come to
[18:49] maturity it was waived as a memorial of
[18:52] Thanksgiving to God believing that the
[18:54] rest of them would come it was a sign so
[18:57] now the wave Chief becomes a sign amen
[18:59] it's a sign that the rest of the field
[19:02] is going to finish the maturing process
[19:04] and come to full maturity in the Harvest
[19:08] and he goes on and says and today
[19:09] because he was the first Son of God to
[19:11] come to full maturity to be in God he
[19:14] was plucked up from the earth and waved
[19:16] over the people oh what a glorious
[19:18] Lesson by the quickening power the first
[19:20] one although he had been typed and many
[19:23] times as we see later that he was typed
[19:26] but this was really the first fruits of
[19:28] them that slept he was waived over the
[19:31] promised seed that had promise of life
[19:33] he was waived at the day of Pentecost
[19:36] when there came a sound from heaven like
[19:38] a a mighty rushing wind and was waved
[19:41] over the people the Pentecostal people
[19:42] that was up at Pentecost waiting for the
[19:45] blessing to come and to be waived again
[19:48] we realize in the last day so brother
[19:50] bam showing us there was a spiritual
[19:52] waving of the sheath the first the first
[19:55] one to come to full Harvest maturity was
[19:57] Jesus Christ and he resurrected out of
[19:59] the dead and was waved back over the
[20:01] congregation on the day of Pentecost
[20:03] amen and and but he says it didn't stop
[20:05] there there's to be another waving of
[20:07] the Sheep in the last day
[20:10] amen he goes now I want to read that
[20:12] again to be waived again we realize in
[20:14] the last day according to Luke 17 30 in
[20:17] the Sunday again and the day that the
[20:20] son of man will be revealed or waived
[20:23] again over the people so the son of man
[20:26] is to be waived over the people again
[20:28] amen not just there on the day of
[20:30] Pentecost but in the last day he's to be
[20:33] waived over the congregation once more
[20:36] how many beliefs were in the last day
[20:38] how many believe he's been waived over
[20:40] the congregation amen so so oh let's
[20:44] just read this next quote and then we'll
[20:46] get into some things
[20:48] further down in the same message he says
[20:50] as Christ was the first one to raise
[20:52] from all the prophets and so forth
[20:54] although typed in many places he was the
[20:56] first fruits of those that slept in the
[20:59] bride coming of Christ so now we're
[21:02] looking at our day amen in the last day
[21:04] and the bride coming of Christ coming
[21:07] out of the church they'll have to be a
[21:09] Sheaf waved again in the last days oh my
[21:12] waving of the sheep what was the Sheaf
[21:14] the first one that come to mature the
[21:17] first one that proved it was a wheat
[21:19] that proved it was a Sheaf Hallelujah
[21:22] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about
[21:23] it was waived over the people and the
[21:26] first time there will come forth for the
[21:28] bride age so now he keeps pointing he
[21:31] keeps placing us
[21:32] the last day the day the son of man will
[21:35] be revealed and the bride age and the
[21:37] bride coming of Christ he's tying all of
[21:39] this together and showing us when this
[21:41] Chief will be waived amen now for the
[21:44] first time there will come forth for the
[21:45] bride age for a resurrection out of dark
[21:48] denominationalism so what is the bride
[21:50] age it's a resurrection out of dark
[21:52] denominationalism
[21:54] will be a message that the full maturity
[21:57] of the word has turned back again in its
[22:00] full power and being waived over the
[22:02] People by the same signs and wonders
[22:04] that he did back there because I live
[22:07] you live also speaking to his wife
[22:09] because I live you live also what a
[22:13] resurrection that was and what a
[22:15] resurrection this is to be quickened
[22:18] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[22:20] Jesus by God's quickening power amen so
[22:23] we're living in the resurrection
[22:25] we're living in the resurrection out of
[22:27] dark denominationalism amen what
[22:29] resurrection that was but what a
[22:31] resurrection this is the first
[22:33] resurrection was the resurrection of
[22:34] Jesus Christ and now he came back Amen
[22:37] to be waived over the people in the day
[22:39] of Pentecost amen but what a
[22:41] resurrection that was but what a
[22:43] resurrection this is
[22:46] praise be to God
[22:49] amen all right the last sentence in this
[22:52] quote he was waved to them the word
[22:55] which he was was way back to them on the
[22:58] day of Pentecost the word made manifest
[23:02] now and as I say it's to be waived again
[23:04] in the last day
[23:07] so it's important to know what is being
[23:09] waived
[23:10] because what is being waived is the word
[23:12] made manifest
[23:14] so what I'd like to just make a a make a
[23:18] few statements to put all of our lining
[23:20] in the right spot amen what was waived
[23:23] was was not a person what was waived was
[23:25] the word
[23:27] and in our day what was waived was not a
[23:29] person what was waived was the word
[23:32] okay so it was the word the word made
[23:35] manifest that was waived and that was an
[23:38] indication amen of the Harvest time
[23:41] because the beginning of the Harvest
[23:43] time would be the cutting of the sheath
[23:45] and the waving before the Lord it notes
[23:48] that we're now in the harvest season
[23:50] amen we're now in Harvest time so we
[23:53] know that we're now in the harvest
[23:54] season we're now in Harvard the Harvest
[23:56] Time which is the last day which is the
[23:59] bright age which is the bride coming of
[24:01] Christ which will require another waving
[24:03] of the Sheaf to kick off the harvest
[24:06] season
[24:09] glory amen
[24:13] so I want to I want to look at this uh
[24:16] waving of the Sheaf and the word amen
[24:19] now when the chief was waived
[24:22] they would go to the field usually on
[24:25] the edge of the field where it got the
[24:27] most sunlight would would ripen the
[24:29] first amen not in the Middle where it's
[24:32] more shaded but over in the edge
[24:33] somewhere they would go and cut the
[24:36] sheath and they would cut a handful of
[24:38] stalks down had the wheat in and they
[24:40] would take all of that back and give it
[24:42] to the priest and the priest would take
[24:43] it before the Lord and wave it before
[24:45] the Lord
[24:46] now you realize that the purpose of
[24:49] waving the Sheaf was showing that the
[24:52] seed is mature
[24:55] it's a sign of maturity in the Harvest
[24:59] all right but more than just the seed
[25:03] was weighed because you have stock and
[25:05] you have shock and you have seed all
[25:07] being waved together
[25:09] you got that they didn't just thresh out
[25:11] the seeds first and just have a handful
[25:13] of no they had the whole shock that they
[25:16] were waving and in that shock the reason
[25:18] they were waving it was because the seed
[25:20] was mature there
[25:22] the machines he was already Harvest
[25:24] mature so they they plucked it up and
[25:27] they waved it all before the Lord and
[25:28] before the congregation and it was a
[25:31] sign that everything else would come to
[25:32] maturity but what was waived was more
[25:35] than just the seed it also had stalk and
[25:38] it also had shock but it also had the
[25:40] seed but the purpose of the waving was
[25:42] the seed
[25:44] so we're all together we're all on the
[25:46] same page I hope
[25:48] brother bam says in Christ is the
[25:51] mystery of God revealed it says now did
[25:53] he what happened in the pre-figure now
[25:55] he opened Adam's side and took part of
[25:57] his flesh which was Adam to make Eve
[26:00] the bride has to be the word
[26:04] now remember what was waived the word
[26:07] what does the bride need to be he must
[26:09] be the word
[26:12] for she must she has to be the word for
[26:14] he is the word she cannot stand on
[26:17] Creeds she cannot stand on
[26:18] denominationalism she cannot stand on
[26:21] good behavior she has to stand alone on
[26:24] the word because she is part of it she
[26:26] was taken from Christ see
[26:29] Christ is the word made manifest
[26:31] she was taken from Christ she must also
[26:34] be the word so she is the word at the
[26:37] end time there's a bride coming of
[26:38] Christ there's a bride age amen so
[26:40] that's the day and age of the Harvest
[26:43] Time amen and there has to be a Sheaf
[26:45] taken from that Harvest amen and waved
[26:48] so there has to be part of the Bride
[26:51] word that's come to maturity
[26:54] amen
[26:55] so we know that there's prophecy laying
[26:58] in the Bible amen of a restoration of of
[27:01] a bride a restoration of what's fallen
[27:03] and brother bam tells us in the
[27:04] Masterpiece we know in the Masterpiece
[27:06] what fell the Masterpiece family fell
[27:09] because God first created a son but the
[27:12] son when the sun was created which was
[27:15] Adam and Adam was put on Earth to have
[27:17] dominion over the Earth God said it is
[27:19] not good that man should dwell alone he
[27:21] was alone amen but within him was his
[27:24] wife
[27:25] we all know this we've rehearsed this so
[27:27] many times amen so God had to extract
[27:30] his wife from him split the feminist
[27:32] Spirit pull a rib out and make the woman
[27:34] and join the two back together that was
[27:36] his Masterpiece that was the Masterpiece
[27:38] family but Satan came in through
[27:41] deception and ruined the Masterpiece so
[27:43] God went back to work to restore the
[27:45] Masterpiece the first part of the
[27:47] restoration was when he restored the
[27:49] last Adam we don't need another atom
[27:51] we've had the last Adam or the second
[27:53] Adam which is Jesus Christ the son has
[27:55] been restored
[27:57] but in that sun was a bride amen was a
[28:00] wife amen so he struck a little blow off
[28:02] to his left side at Calvary and Out Come
[28:05] the ingredients or the material for a
[28:07] wife come the spirit and the word amen
[28:09] and he began to form now amen you begin
[28:12] to form now starting at Pentecost begin
[28:15] to form the wife amen what's he doing
[28:17] he's rebuilding what's Fallen this is
[28:19] all a prophecy showing what God is doing
[28:22] restoring back what had fallen at the
[28:24] beginning
[28:26] that's why when we get to the Book of
[28:27] Revelation we start to see prophecy
[28:29] about the bride
[28:34] show you the bride the Lamb's wife and
[28:36] we have all of these things in the Book
[28:37] of Revelation at the end because it's
[28:39] the restoration of the bride at the end
[28:41] of the book bringing her back in Union
[28:43] with Christ and restoring back and
[28:46] eating condition upon the Earth for a
[28:48] thousand year honeymoon
[28:50] so the book is a book of redemption
[28:53] the whole Bible this whole Bible is
[28:55] about a book of redemption
[28:58] what's being redeemed what was lost in
[29:00] the beginning what was in the beginning
[29:02] God created Eden in his in his pleasure
[29:05] in his Eden he had a garden in the
[29:06] garden he had a son and his son's wife
[29:08] and he gave him rulership over all of
[29:10] creation and then that fell and the rest
[29:12] of the book is redemption bringing it
[29:15] back to that place
[29:17] so this is a book of redemption
[29:21] amen that makes it also The Book of Life
[29:25] which also makes it a marriage
[29:26] certificate
[29:28] because it's all about marriage amen
[29:31] so now the we know at the end what must
[29:34] be waived is the word
[29:37] but what portion of the word amen
[29:41] and the message things that are to be
[29:43] the problem says now if we are those
[29:45] attributes of God we cannot live by
[29:47] Creeds we cannot live by the
[29:49] denominationalism we must live by the
[29:52] word
[29:52] because the brightest part of the
[29:54] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[29:56] husband therefore we must be that word
[29:59] bride and what is the word bride the
[30:02] manifestation of this hour so what is
[30:05] the word bride she is part of the word
[30:07] and she is the word manifested for this
[30:11] hour not a previous hour for Harvest
[30:13] Time so what's Harvest time it's bride
[30:16] time
[30:17] it's the bride age bride time she is
[30:20] what is the word bride the manifestation
[30:21] of this hour the bride not a Crete or
[30:24] denomination but a living Oracle of God
[30:26] a living attribute of God displaying to
[30:29] the world the attributes of God in the
[30:31] formation of the Bride that's to be
[30:33] expressed in this hour that we're not
[30:36] living
[30:38] all right we have no argument with that
[30:40] right
[30:41] so now we know
[30:43] what the Harvest Time denotes and and
[30:46] what's coming to maturity what part of
[30:48] the word is coming to maturity amen
[30:51] because it has to be the bride part
[30:53] coming to maturity because for the
[30:56] church ages you know the the church was
[30:58] birthed at Pentecost amen when that
[31:00] first wave Chief was waived over and it
[31:02] was birthed at Pentecost and it was
[31:04] supposed to grow all the way into
[31:06] Perfection and be United with Christ but
[31:08] the Roman the Roman caterpillar come in
[31:10] the bug the insect and it started to eat
[31:13] it down and the church ages shows a
[31:15] church that's now falling from its
[31:17] position amen and being restored back
[31:19] amen there's over 2 000 years amen God
[31:22] is fashioning his bride and restoring a
[31:25] bride amen but there has to come a time
[31:27] where it's no longer church and no
[31:29] longer Church age but the whole intent
[31:31] and purpose now has to come into
[31:32] manifestation not to have another church
[31:35] or another church age but to have a
[31:38] bride Amen to restore back what the
[31:41] original intent was
[31:43] so now he's growing it back through the
[31:46] reformers through the reform raids and
[31:47] the mayonnaise he's bringing it back
[31:48] through Luther Wesley Pentecost through
[31:51] justification sanctification baptism the
[31:53] Holy Ghost and he's bringing a bride
[31:55] back and he says in 1962 now she's
[31:57] standing on her feet amen
[32:01] so that is the word
[32:04] that is being restored that is the word
[32:07] that is coming into manifestation in the
[32:09] Harvest Time
[32:11] every other word's already manifest
[32:14] the manifestation of Jesus Christ of the
[32:19] restored Adam the last Adam is already
[32:21] been manifest
[32:23] the church ages have already been
[32:25] manifest
[32:26] but what's to be manifest now for the
[32:28] Gentiles is not a church but a bride
[32:33] so
[32:34] in the Harvest Time
[32:37] now we know the season now we know the
[32:39] word that's to be restored to the
[32:40] Gentiles
[32:42] so in the in the Harvest time now God
[32:45] will have another wave chief
[32:48] at the end time
[32:50] and in that wave sheath once again he'll
[32:53] pluck up a part of the of the field that
[32:58] has come to harvest maturity and to
[33:00] begin to wave it and when he begins to
[33:03] wave this wave Chief over the people
[33:04] again what's being waived is the word
[33:09] all right what's being waived is the
[33:12] word because the word has come back amen
[33:15] that it's gone through the process of
[33:17] growth it's women to the ground and died
[33:20] and it come forth has sprung forth It's
[33:22] went through uh blade went through
[33:24] tassel went through shock went through
[33:26] seeing now it's come back to seed and
[33:29] now that it comes back to seed now
[33:31] there's a waving of Thanksgiving but
[33:33] also a sign now there has to be a sign
[33:35] saying we're in the harvest season there
[33:38] is one part that has come to maturity
[33:40] proving that the rest is going to come
[33:43] to maturity
[33:46] that's why sometimes we say we've seen
[33:49] the wave Chief and and William Branham
[33:51] and that is absolutely the truth but it
[33:53] wasn't the man it was the word
[33:57] because he was the Forerunner of the
[33:59] second coming but he was also part of
[34:01] the Bride
[34:03] he was also a member of the Bride he
[34:05] himself had also come out of dark
[34:07] denominationalism he has also
[34:09] experienced a resurrection out of manage
[34:11] coming into the eagle age coming into
[34:13] the Harvest Time amen and we see a Son
[34:16] of God come into an adoption position
[34:18] like brother Branham did and he's
[34:21] showing full maturity in the bride in
[34:24] that vessel and it was plucked up and
[34:26] waved over the people not the man he was
[34:30] the stalk and he was the shock but
[34:32] inside of him was the word
[34:34] yeah
[34:35] and that was Christ working through that
[34:37] man amen demonstrating what amen an
[34:42] adopted son of God looks like at the end
[34:44] time what a member of the Bride looks
[34:46] like when it comes to maturity
[34:49] but when it was waived remember it was
[34:52] stuck and shock
[34:55] and Seed
[35:00] praise God
[35:02] so many things that I want to say
[35:06] so many things so I don't want to get
[35:08] confused because you can say brother Ben
[35:10] was the wave sheet and that in one part
[35:12] is correct and one part it's not correct
[35:15] because it has to be the word that was
[35:16] waived
[35:18] so it was the word in him that was
[35:19] weighed before the Lord for our
[35:21] acceptance amen and it was waived as a
[35:23] sign of Thanksgiving end a sign it was
[35:26] the word that had come to maturity amen
[35:28] but that word was still housed in a part
[35:31] of the Dead grain the part of the the
[35:33] thing that was holding it up
[35:35] makes sense okay
[35:37] that's so important that's the part that
[35:40] I really want to focus on
[35:43] amen because we know that now in the
[35:46] wave Chief which we've we believe we've
[35:48] seen the wave Chief in our day amen the
[35:50] same son of man was waved again
[35:53] it wasn't brother random wasn't the son
[35:55] of man he was a son of man revealing the
[35:57] son of man so where was the son of man
[35:59] he was being revealed in a son of man
[36:01] amen and that a son of man was being
[36:04] waved over because the son of man had
[36:06] come to maturity in a son of man
[36:09] amen
[36:10] and so now we saw it I mean we saw it
[36:13] clearly on display without mistake amen
[36:15] so Vindicated and so proven by God so
[36:18] now we've seen that so what does that
[36:20] mean what is that what does that
[36:22] actually mean it means thank God it's
[36:26] Harvest Time thank God whatever happened
[36:29] to that first part is happening to the
[36:32] rest of us
[36:34] the every other part of the Bride field
[36:37] that's laying there this wheat plant
[36:39] this field that's got to come to harvest
[36:41] maturity at the end time whatever
[36:43] happened to that first part is the same
[36:46] thing that's happening to us that was a
[36:48] sign that the whole field is coming to
[36:50] harvest maturity not maybe not hope so
[36:54] but it's a sign that whatever brought
[36:57] this to maturity is going to bring the
[36:59] rest of it to maturity
[37:02] it's it's a Thanksgiving amen and so now
[37:05] when we see that Ministry when we see
[37:07] that life when we see that level of
[37:09] consecration that level of obedience
[37:11] that that manifestation uh of the word
[37:15] and the gifts of the Spirit and the the
[37:17] life of the spirit amen operating in
[37:20] that man it's not so that we can stand
[37:22] there and say oh what a man that was I
[37:24] mean that's our that's our reaction we
[37:26] appreciate and value what that was but
[37:28] if we just fixate on what was being
[37:30] waived we missed the whole point of it
[37:33] being waived
[37:35] because the whole point of the waving
[37:37] was that I can have absolute confidence
[37:40] in God that if God could take that part
[37:43] to maturity he can take me to maturity
[37:46] amen and he's already working the
[37:48] process because this is Harvest Time
[37:51] [Music]
[37:52] this is the the whole point of the sign
[37:56] that's been waived at the end time and
[37:58] the Messianic sign that's been shown in
[38:00] the Life of Christ on display through
[38:02] human flesh the whole point of that was
[38:05] not so that we can memorialize that and
[38:07] remember what was done so but that would
[38:10] give us Faith to recognize that all I
[38:12] need to do is lay in the presence of
[38:15] this Jesus Christ that has returned to
[38:17] his church and it'll bring me to the
[38:19] same Harvest maturity I'm on that same
[38:22] road I'm to that same destination that
[38:25] is my goal
[38:27] not not something I idolize but
[38:30] something I'm pointed to something that
[38:32] I'm that's showing me the way to walk in
[38:34] the direction I'm walking and the goal
[38:36] the place that I am coming to
[38:39] is that maturity
[38:42] how do you know there's already been a
[38:44] Thanksgiving wave
[38:46] and it's already been a sign
[38:49] believing that the rest of them is going
[38:51] to come
[38:53] and I believe I'm one of the rest of
[38:55] them
[38:56] do you you can say oh brother Chad I'm
[38:59] still in the milk phase you know my
[39:01] seed's still juicy and tender and needs
[39:03] baked out hey well praise God it'll get
[39:05] baked out
[39:07] we don't have to hope we don't have to
[39:09] wonder what they were in God has so
[39:11] shown the sign that there's no question
[39:13] in what day we're in we're no question
[39:15] in what hour and we're no questioning
[39:17] what was weighed before us amen it
[39:19] should not allow another question in our
[39:22] heart amen if we by faith recognize who
[39:25] we are then we recognize what road we're
[39:27] on and what's happening in our lives
[39:30] God is bringing us to that same level of
[39:33] maturity
[39:35] when I say that
[39:37] I don't I don't mean to say that we are
[39:41] all going to operate in the office of a
[39:42] prophet
[39:43] I don't mean we'll hold the same office
[39:46] I don't even mean that we're going to
[39:48] manifest all the same manifestations
[39:52] but we're coming to that same maturity
[39:57] and you know more than a gift I want
[40:00] that maturity
[40:02] I want that character I want that life
[40:04] more than a gift more than a sign and a
[40:07] Wonder more than anything else I want
[40:09] that character
[40:12] because a sign of Wonder a gift a
[40:15] manifestation amen can lead you and
[40:17] others astray but that character will
[40:19] never get off
[40:21] that life will never leave Christ amen
[40:24] but a gift can
[40:28] brother bam says in the message
[40:30] spiritual food and due season says now
[40:32] do you see where I'm trying to get to
[40:35] I spoke with you pretty plain this
[40:36] morning don't you see the authority of
[40:38] the Living God in the Living Church the
[40:41] bride
[40:42] where do you see it it was in his
[40:44] ministry he's saying don't you see it
[40:46] but he's trying to show you what you're
[40:48] looking at
[40:49] do you see the authority of the Living
[40:51] God in the Living Church the bride the
[40:54] sicker healed the dead are raised the
[40:56] cripples walk the blind seed the gospel
[40:58] Goes Forth in its power for the message
[41:00] and the messenger are the same
[41:06] what was his message
[41:08] his message is that Christ is returning
[41:11] to the church
[41:13] he's forerunning the second coming of
[41:15] Christ and Christ is coming to unite
[41:17] with the bride amen so now his message
[41:20] is declaring amen that Christ is here
[41:24] and so the message and the messenger are
[41:27] the same so he becomes the example of
[41:30] his message
[41:32] and his message in the end time is
[41:34] showing the bride coming of Christ the
[41:36] bride Christ returning and uniting the
[41:39] headship coming together with the body
[41:41] to become one unit and now he the
[41:44] message and the messenger are the same
[41:45] he becomes a display of his very message
[41:51] he goes on to say the word is in the
[41:53] church in the person
[41:56] praise God
[41:59] now we've laid the foundation now I want
[42:01] to get to where I want to get to
[42:04] says now in the anointing ones at the
[42:06] end time he says now I want you to know
[42:08] this is sure and you that listen to this
[42:09] tape you might have thought today that I
[42:11] was trying to say that about myself
[42:14] being that I was packing this message
[42:17] I have no more to do with it than
[42:19] nothing
[42:20] no more than just a voice in my voice
[42:23] even against my better judgment
[42:27] I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the
[42:29] will of my father that I declare to do
[42:31] and I determined to do I wasn't the one
[42:33] that appeared down on the river I was
[42:35] only standing there when he appeared I'm
[42:37] not the one that performs these things
[42:39] and foretells these things that happened
[42:40] so perfect that the perfect they are I'm
[42:43] only one that's near when he does it I
[42:46] was only a voice that he used to say it
[42:48] I wasn't what I it wasn't what I knew
[42:50] it's what I just surrendered myself to
[42:54] that he spoke through it isn't me
[42:58] I want to lay that down as a foundation
[43:00] because then when we look at where the
[43:02] wave Chief took place and what all was
[43:04] plucked up and waved and where the seed
[43:06] come to harvest maturity I mean when we
[43:08] look all at all of that amen
[43:11] it's very easy to start putting Merit on
[43:14] a person
[43:16] and and I don't think there's anything
[43:18] wrong with showing appreciation for a
[43:20] person
[43:21] even the person that's carrying a gift I
[43:23] and I don't think it's wrong to
[43:25] appreciate brother Branham I don't think
[43:26] that's wrong at all
[43:28] I don't think it's wrong to love him to
[43:30] appreciate him to Value the sacrifices
[43:32] he made but brother Brandon is very
[43:34] clear in letting you know that it wasn't
[43:35] him
[43:38] it wasn't him it wasn't his power it
[43:40] wasn't his intellect it was in his mind
[43:42] it was in his spiritual uh understanding
[43:45] it wasn't his scriptural knowledge it
[43:47] wasn't him it was God working through
[43:50] him
[43:51] then he goes on to say it's not because
[43:53] it wasn't what I knew it's what I just
[43:56] surrendered myself to
[43:58] now remember I titled this the wave
[44:00] Chief is our example
[44:02] so now the wave Chief becomes our
[44:04] example now now if I'm coming to that
[44:07] Harvest maturity I want to see what
[44:10] brought him to harvest maturity and what
[44:13] it looked like when he came to that
[44:14] maturity
[44:16] and when he come to that maturity I mean
[44:19] he wasn't one bit puffed up proud
[44:22] arrogant he wasn't any of that he had he
[44:24] had no no confidence in his flesh no
[44:26] confidence in himself all of his
[44:28] confidence was in God he knew who was
[44:31] doing the work and he knew he was just
[44:32] there when he was doing those things I
[44:34] was just standing there when he did it
[44:36] I Didn't Do It Christ did it I'm just a
[44:39] voice that he used amen he said even
[44:42] against my better judgment he said it
[44:44] wasn't what I determined to do not even
[44:46] what he wanted to do he had a different
[44:48] desire for his life amen but God had a
[44:50] desire and a purpose for his life and
[44:52] when he surrendered to that God did the
[44:55] work through a surrendered vessel
[44:57] and we saw it as the very life of Jesus
[45:00] Christ on display
[45:02] we saw it as some of the most
[45:04] Supernatural happenings that have that
[45:06] have ever been recorded in humanity
[45:10] we saw it as some of the most amazing
[45:12] things we've ever heard and seen the
[45:13] most amazing testimonies the most
[45:15] amazing the discernment the most amazing
[45:18] things that we have ever seen or been
[45:20] recorded amen we see that amen but
[45:22] brother Brahms really wants us to know
[45:24] that when you see that although although
[45:27] the seed is still in this old dry Sheaf
[45:30] it's not the stalk anymore that's worth
[45:33] anything it's not the shuck anymore
[45:35] that's worth anything it's the seed
[45:37] that's on the inside that's what we're
[45:39] focusing on that's what this is all
[45:41] about
[45:46] so now
[45:47] if we could think this is this is just
[45:50] brother Chad now if you'll just allow me
[45:52] just to think of this in a little
[45:54] different way for a minute if we think
[45:56] of that sheep if we think of that wave
[45:58] sheep at the end time we think there's
[46:01] an old dry stalk there and the leaves
[46:02] have already fallen off or collapsed
[46:04] they're all dry there's a shuck there
[46:06] that's still somewhat holding the seed
[46:08] when they wave it it's all right there
[46:10] and if we could just take that as an
[46:13] example of the human being
[46:16] that the stalk is my flesh
[46:19] and the shock is my spirit
[46:22] but the seed is the gene of God in my
[46:24] soul
[46:27] all right
[46:29] before that before that this grain could
[46:32] come to maturity
[46:35] everything around the grain has to die
[46:39] the process of maturity to bring the
[46:43] grain to full Harvest maturity is death
[46:46] to everything that's holding it
[46:50] stalk has to Die the leaves have to drop
[46:53] off the shuck has to get dry and brittle
[46:55] everything has to die and the debtor it
[46:58] is the more Harvest ready the seed is
[47:02] until it gets to the point it's dead
[47:05] it's brittle it's fragile there's no
[47:08] more life in it all the life now has
[47:11] gone to the seed and all the life now is
[47:15] in the seed
[47:16] that's what this wave Chief is all about
[47:20] what's waived it may be more than the
[47:22] seeds being waved absolutely but you
[47:24] know everything else is pretty much
[47:26] worthless
[47:27] the only thing of value is the seed
[47:30] the only thing the only reason there's a
[47:32] waving is not because they're so you can
[47:34] see stock absolutely you can see the
[47:36] stuff you can see the shut there but the
[47:38] waving is not for the shock and the
[47:40] waving is not for the stalk the waving
[47:42] is for the seed
[47:43] that's what's important
[47:45] signifying that whatever brought this to
[47:47] harvest is going to bring the rest to
[47:49] harvest so then you look out the field
[47:50] and you see stalks and maybe different
[47:53] stages of drying out amen the leaves may
[47:55] be wilting and falling and shut maybe
[47:57] still holding tires starting to separate
[47:59] there may be some greenness still around
[48:01] it amen but you look out there and say
[48:03] when it's harvest ready all of this will
[48:06] look like this
[48:10] that's why I say the wave Chief is our
[48:12] example
[48:14] because when I get Harvest ready amen
[48:17] this is going to be dead amen my inner
[48:20] man and my my spirit man is going to be
[48:22] dead amen but the inside of the inside
[48:25] needs to come to life and become the
[48:27] dominant life in my life amen to come to
[48:30] harvest maturity
[48:31] and then we can all say it's not me it's
[48:34] not what I've done it's not anything I
[48:36] knew it's not anything I'd done but
[48:37] there's something inside of me that's
[48:40] beyond me that's been quickened to Life
[48:42] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[48:43] it's the very Life of Christ Living now
[48:46] through me
[48:47] it's not me it's the seed that somebody
[48:49] else planted in me
[48:53] amen this is how Brother Bear could say
[48:55] such things as it's not just it's not me
[48:58] I'm just a voice he used I was just
[49:02] standing near when he did all of these
[49:03] things because he had the proper
[49:05] understanding of what was happening in
[49:07] his life
[49:09] and I I think we need to have the proper
[49:12] understanding of what's happening in our
[49:13] life
[49:16] in John chapter 5 let's turn together
[49:18] and read this scripture in John chapter
[49:20] 5.
[49:22] in verse 19.
[49:29] foreign
[49:35] John chapter 5 verse 19.
[49:47] all right
[49:49] says
[49:52] then answer Jesus and said unto them
[49:54] verily verily I say unto you the son can
[49:56] do nothing of himself
[49:58] but what he seeth the father do for what
[50:00] things so ever he doeth these also do
[50:03] what the son likewise for the Father
[50:05] loveth the Son
[50:06] and showeth him all things that he
[50:08] himself doeth and he will show him
[50:09] Greater Works than these that you may
[50:11] Marvel
[50:13] so here Jesus is he's the this is the
[50:16] first corn of wheat coming into full
[50:18] maturity
[50:20] and he's saying I don't do my own will
[50:26] I only do what the father shows me
[50:29] he even told him he says it's not me but
[50:32] it's the father in me he doeth the works
[50:35] so now Jesus is speaking just like
[50:38] brother Branham speaking and anointed
[50:39] ones at the end time
[50:41] Jesus is saying it's not me it's the
[50:43] father in me the father in me he's the
[50:45] one doing the works and and I only do
[50:48] that which the father shows me so Jesus
[50:50] is standing here amen God made flesh but
[50:53] he's playing the role of a submissive
[50:55] son a perfect son and he's saying I
[50:58] don't take my own mind I don't take my
[51:00] own will I don't do it on my own accord
[51:01] I only do what the father shows me and
[51:04] the works that I do I don't do of my own
[51:06] but it's the father in me he doeth the
[51:08] works
[51:10] that's the that's the first corn of
[51:13] wheat that come to maturity
[51:15] now in the bride maturing the whole
[51:18] Harvest material there's been a sheep
[51:20] up and waved amen and when we've
[51:22] seen that God used that vessel God used
[51:24] that man and in him the word come to
[51:27] come to life before us you can see that
[51:29] he speaks the exact same way
[51:32] it's not me it's not what I thought not
[51:34] what I could do it wasn't me it was him
[51:36] amen I was just standing near when he
[51:39] did it it's not me I'm just the voice he
[51:41] used that he spoke through and then I
[51:44] mean all of these things he's saying now
[51:45] it's not what I knew it's just what I
[51:46] surrendered myself to he's speaking just
[51:49] like the first Corner weeds
[51:51] why because if the bride ever comes back
[51:53] it's got to be just like Jesus Christ
[51:56] it's got to have the same character the
[51:57] same traits the same surrender the same
[51:59] obedience the same life has to be a
[52:01] display here male version and female
[52:03] version but with the same character
[52:07] and I believe we got to see that
[52:12] in the
[52:14] message hear ye him
[52:17] speaking about adoption he starts to
[52:19] teach on adoption and we know that
[52:22] adoption is the placing of a son
[52:24] adoptions like the not our modern
[52:26] adoption where somebody doesn't have a
[52:29] child and they want to to raise another
[52:31] child and make a home form so they adopt
[52:33] somebody into their family that's not
[52:34] adoption not biblical adoption biblical
[52:37] adoption is where they have a son their
[52:40] own son their own child of their own
[52:42] loins amen but they want to bring them
[52:45] up right so that they can take the
[52:47] inheritance and become heir of the
[52:50] family business or the Family Farm amen
[52:52] so brother Ben says they put him under
[52:53] the instruction of tutors amen and the
[52:56] tutor will begin to raise the Sun and
[52:58] when the sun comes to maturity and he's
[53:00] able to conduct business like the father
[53:02] is then the father adopts his son and he
[53:06] positionally places him in a position of
[53:08] authority and Power
[53:10] so it's adoption is positional placing
[53:14] that's adoption so brother bam is
[53:16] talking here about adoption
[53:19] and
[53:21] I'm going to look at this in the message
[53:23] here ye him now notice how this tutor
[53:26] would come before the father
[53:28] and if the son had did wrong the child
[53:30] was disobedient how he must have turned
[53:33] his head and said father I just hate to
[53:34] bring you this message but oh this
[53:36] disobedient child what would the father
[53:38] do Bow his head in shame he's talking
[53:40] about one son that's not listening but
[53:42] then he's going to turn it to the son
[53:44] that is listening
[53:46] and brother bear said who did God get to
[53:48] be the the Tudor he said it's the Holy
[53:50] Ghost is our tutor
[53:53] he said now now let's change the thought
[53:56] what if this tutor come before the
[53:58] father and said oh sir
[53:59] your boy is just like you
[54:04] why you know he just acts just like you
[54:07] do
[54:09] this is going to be so important hold on
[54:11] to that statement
[54:13] he loves the things that you teach he
[54:16] likes to run the farm the way you run it
[54:17] oh in a street expression he's just a
[54:20] chip off the block he's just like you
[54:22] you're a holy God he believes in being
[54:25] holy you're a great all-powerful God he
[54:27] says Amen to it you're a great God to
[54:29] work miracles he believes every word of
[54:31] it and practices the same
[54:33] oh how it must please the father yes
[54:36] that's my son sure you know what
[54:38] happened then when the child come to a
[54:41] certain age the boy if he had been a a
[54:44] bad boy and was not exactly what the
[54:45] father could trust him he never had any
[54:47] inheritance at all you rather know that
[54:49] from the scripture but if he was an
[54:51] obedient son and when he become to a
[54:53] certain age then the same son was taken
[54:55] out into a public place before the
[54:57] public and he was put up on a high place
[54:59] and there the father put a robe on him
[55:01] and he adopted his own son into his
[55:03] family and on this placing of the son
[55:06] that son's name was just as good on a
[55:08] check as his father's was because he'd
[55:11] been proven he was obedient and his name
[55:13] was good just the same as the father
[55:18] and brothers showing this adoption now
[55:20] and and how the tutor would come to the
[55:22] father and he would give the good report
[55:25] and so in order for the son to come to
[55:28] adoption he must meet a certain criteria
[55:32] and here's the criteria
[55:35] your boy is just like you
[55:40] he acts just like you do
[55:45] he loves the things that you teach
[55:48] he likes to run the farm the way you run
[55:50] it
[55:53] you're a holy God
[55:55] he believes in being holy
[55:59] see the tutor is saying he's ready for
[56:02] adoption because he's exactly like you
[56:07] not he has his own idea he's got new
[56:10] technology he wants to implement in the
[56:11] farm he's waiting for Dad to get out of
[56:13] the way so he can bring some better
[56:14] ideas
[56:18] adoption when he comes to adoption is
[56:20] not when the son thinks he's ready and
[56:23] he knows something and he's able to do
[56:25] the work that's not adoption he's ready
[56:27] for an adoption when he has no mind of
[56:29] his own no thought of his own no desire
[56:31] of his own he's ready for adoption when
[56:33] he only wants to do an act just like the
[56:35] father
[56:36] then the tutor says he's ready for
[56:38] adoption and the father says he's ready
[56:40] for adoption let's put him in adoption
[56:42] so you see it's not it's not this
[56:45] modernistic idea of we know what to do
[56:48] we've got it all figured out amen just
[56:50] turn us loose that's not that is not the
[56:53] right attitude for adoption but if we're
[56:55] going to come into adoption and this is
[56:57] adoption age
[56:58] the bride age is adoption AJ man because
[57:01] through the church it was a maturing it
[57:03] was a bringing back but the adoption
[57:05] comes in the bride age amen it's a
[57:07] placing now you're to be wife amen
[57:10] you're not to just be church anymore
[57:11] you're to be bride
[57:13] so now the whole age is an adoption age
[57:17] where the church is being positionally
[57:20] placed as a wife
[57:22] as a bride not church anymore that's why
[57:24] when brother Branham comes through the
[57:25] first seal he says I'm not going to call
[57:27] you church I'm going to call you bride
[57:29] so that you'll understand we're moving
[57:31] into an adoption age now you're being
[57:34] placed what you always were meant to be
[57:36] you've grown up through Luther Wesley
[57:38] Pinnacle there's been a restoration of
[57:41] the bright tree but now the bright tree
[57:42] has to be placed and as it's placed it's
[57:45] placed under the headship of her husband
[57:47] United in an invisible Union
[57:51] this is placing time
[57:54] so now the bride is coming to adoption
[57:57] this is the adoption age
[58:00] but what makes her ripe for adoption
[58:03] is not because she thinks she knows
[58:05] something
[58:08] because the tutor says
[58:10] she is just like you
[58:14] she only wants to do what you say
[58:17] she only wants to obey your scripture
[58:19] she she doesn't argue over every Point
[58:21] she doesn't look for a loophole
[58:24] she doesn't try to justify her actions
[58:30] you see what I'm saying
[58:33] what's happening when it comes time for
[58:36] adoption amen when it comes time from
[58:38] adoption is also a sign of maturity
[58:42] when it comes time for the grain to
[58:44] mature everything around that seed is
[58:46] dead
[58:50] this boy who's going through the
[58:52] tudorship he's got lessons to learn he's
[58:55] got things that he's got to learn and if
[58:56] he doesn't get it right he must repeat
[58:58] the lesson
[58:59] how many has been have lessons
[59:01] have you ever repeated any
[59:05] I think I'm still working on some
[59:08] and he's not going to move on until he
[59:10] gets an a you know this isn't like you
[59:13] know just pass them on so we don't have
[59:14] to deal with them let the next great
[59:15] teacher deal no this tutor is going to
[59:17] make sure we're going to learn all our
[59:18] lessons amen
[59:20] and so now he's going through the
[59:22] lessons until he stops doing it his way
[59:26] and starts following the instruction of
[59:29] the tutor
[59:30] and the tutor is the Holy Ghost and the
[59:33] Holy Ghost always operates according to
[59:35] the word
[59:38] so now we're in the tudorship until we
[59:43] finally surrender
[59:45] until we lose all of our childish
[59:48] Notions
[59:50] until we lose all of our pride and all
[59:54] of our ambition because that's not going
[59:56] to work for the inheritance
[59:58] we can't go this young man I mean he
[1:00:01] can't go he can't just listen he can't
[1:00:05] just understand calculus and accounting
[1:00:07] and finance and Seed sowing and planting
[1:00:09] because he's also got to have the
[1:00:11] character to take the inheritance not
[1:00:13] just the skills
[1:00:16] because if he takes the skills without
[1:00:18] the character he'll still ruin the farm
[1:00:21] and lose the inheritance because he's
[1:00:23] got the skills to plant and the skills
[1:00:25] to take the money to the bank and to
[1:00:27] count it but he doesn't have the
[1:00:28] character to manage the blessings that
[1:00:30] come with it and so he will bankrupt he
[1:00:33] will destroy the family farm so he's got
[1:00:36] to have more than just skills he's got
[1:00:39] to be just like the father because the
[1:00:41] father has been able to manage all of
[1:00:43] this
[1:00:46] let me ask ourselves why is life so hard
[1:00:51] because we have a wonderful inheritance
[1:00:53] that's promised to us
[1:00:57] why does it have to be this hard why do
[1:01:00] things keep happening why why is it one
[1:01:03] step forward one step back two step
[1:01:04] forward another step back why is life so
[1:01:07] hard I'll tell you why life is so hard
[1:01:09] because you're going to inherit the
[1:01:11] world the whole Creation with Christ
[1:01:13] Jesus you are in joint Heir and will sit
[1:01:15] on the throne with him that's why life
[1:01:18] is so hard
[1:01:20] now do you hate life
[1:01:22] no we love life
[1:01:25] now we say thank you God there's some
[1:01:27] things that I need to know
[1:01:31] and so now we look at
[1:01:34] oh my goodness again and hear ye him it
[1:01:38] says now then you have the word of God
[1:01:40] the authority of God and then as God
[1:01:42] shows you what to do you're led by the
[1:01:44] spirit and you do the things that's
[1:01:45] pleasing to God
[1:01:47] now Jesus was being adopted on the day
[1:01:49] of Mount Transfiguration God was
[1:01:52] adopting his own son and to his family
[1:01:53] now he took Peter James and John and he
[1:01:56] took Moses Elijah and Jesus and he
[1:01:58] brought them up to the top of the
[1:01:59] mountain
[1:02:00] and there you notice he was transfigured
[1:02:02] before them what was it put into a
[1:02:04] public place up high on a mountain can
[1:02:06] you see the similarity and then when he
[1:02:09] did what did he do he was transfigured
[1:02:11] and the Bible said that his raiment
[1:02:13] Shine Like the Sun and its strength that
[1:02:15] robe that the father in the Old
[1:02:16] Testament put on his son for the day of
[1:02:18] adoption God put his robe of immortality
[1:02:21] upon his son in the day of adoption so
[1:02:24] Brother Bear shows us that mount
[1:02:25] Transfiguration was an adoption
[1:02:28] because he was going to entrust all of
[1:02:32] Creation in the hands of Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] because he was going to place upon him
[1:02:38] the sin of the entire world and he was
[1:02:40] going to Bear the sin of the whole world
[1:02:42] to Calvary Amen to be the Lamb of God
[1:02:45] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:02:47] and redeems back purchases back
[1:02:49] everything that's lost and God was going
[1:02:51] to hand this to Jesus Christ but he
[1:02:54] first had to be tested and he had to
[1:02:56] come to adoption so that he could go to
[1:02:58] Calvary carrying the whole inheritance
[1:03:05] let's look at this in uh Matthew 17.
[1:03:08] let's look at Matthew 17 real quick
[1:03:09] we'll read this and then move on
[1:03:14] Matthew 17.
[1:03:22] in verse 1.
[1:03:25] Matthew chapter 17 verse 1. this is
[1:03:27] Mount Transfiguration
[1:03:30] and after six days Jesus taketh Peter
[1:03:32] and James and John his brother and
[1:03:34] bringeth them up into a high mountain
[1:03:36] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:03:38] in his face did shine as the sun and his
[1:03:40] raiment was white as light and behold
[1:03:43] there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[1:03:45] talking with him then answered Peter and
[1:03:48] said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us
[1:03:50] to be here if thou Wilt let us make your
[1:03:52] three Tabernacles one for thee and one
[1:03:54] for Moses and one for Elias and while he
[1:03:57] yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[1:03:59] overshadowed him and behold a voice out
[1:04:01] of the cloud which said this is my
[1:04:03] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:04:06] hear ye him
[1:04:09] this is a significant statement because
[1:04:11] it's almost a repeat of the statement
[1:04:13] that was made at the Jordan River
[1:04:16] because when Jesus came to Jordan and
[1:04:18] was baptized by John the Baptist God
[1:04:21] from Heaven repeats almost the same
[1:04:23] statement said this is my beloved Son in
[1:04:25] whom I'm well pleased
[1:04:27] but we know it's there he declared him
[1:04:30] to be a son but from that point he went
[1:04:32] straight to testing
[1:04:34] Jesus come up out of the Waters of
[1:04:36] baptism filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:38] he went straight to the Wilderness to be
[1:04:39] tempted of the devil for 40 days
[1:04:42] what was he doing he was being tested he
[1:04:44] was being tried amen and he was tested
[1:04:47] by the three great Temptations the lust
[1:04:49] of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride
[1:04:51] of life and he passed that test and then
[1:04:53] he was tested in the pharise by the
[1:04:54] Pharisees he was tested by Israeli
[1:04:56] Israelites he was tested when they
[1:04:59] wanted to make him a king he was tested
[1:05:00] in so many ways he was tested
[1:05:03] but when he come to mount
[1:05:04] Transfiguration this is his adoption
[1:05:08] and in the adoption he repeats the same
[1:05:10] phrase but he adds to it this is my son
[1:05:13] in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him
[1:05:18] now he has it all now he inherited all
[1:05:23] now he's the boss of it all
[1:05:26] who was with him Moses and Elijah
[1:05:28] representing the law and the prophets
[1:05:30] what is that that's the word of God
[1:05:31] that's the whole Old Testament and and
[1:05:33] Peter wants to build three Tabernacles
[1:05:35] one for the prophets one for the law
[1:05:37] Moses and an eyes and one for Jesus but
[1:05:40] God Cuts him off short and says no you
[1:05:42] hear him he's the Fulfillment of the law
[1:05:45] and the prophets he is everything and
[1:05:47] now he's brought him into a position of
[1:05:49] authority and power here ye him I'm
[1:05:52] putting all the word on him I'm putting
[1:05:54] all the responsibility on him and I'm
[1:05:56] putting the entire inheritance on him
[1:06:03] he had been tested
[1:06:04] his whole life was attesting
[1:06:07] tested in the wilderness tested for
[1:06:10] three and a half years in Ministry he
[1:06:11] was tested but he passed every test
[1:06:15] and God brought him into adoption
[1:06:18] and now
[1:06:19] you know that he has to go to Calvary to
[1:06:22] pay the price for the inheritance
[1:06:25] and on the way to Calvary is Gethsemane
[1:06:30] and in Gethsemane the word Gethsemane
[1:06:32] means an oil press
[1:06:35] and Gethsemane is a olive Orchard with
[1:06:39] olive trees
[1:06:41] so it's very fitting the name is very
[1:06:44] fitting
[1:06:45] that in the Grove of olive trees Jesus
[1:06:48] bows down and begins to pray
[1:06:50] and says father
[1:06:52] let this cup pass for me
[1:06:55] father let this cup pass from me
[1:06:58] but thy will not mine
[1:07:02] here you have a son
[1:07:04] is he in agony as a human being he's in
[1:07:07] agony so much so that is the the drops
[1:07:11] of sweat were dropping as great drops of
[1:07:13] blood upon the ground he was in utter
[1:07:15] Agony but he had already been proved and
[1:07:17] already been tested he could go through
[1:07:19] the oil press
[1:07:21] and he could stay true to the
[1:07:23] Commandment of the father
[1:07:25] three times he asked did this cup pass
[1:07:27] from me but in the last time he said if
[1:07:30] if this cup cannot pass from me then thy
[1:07:33] will be done
[1:07:37] this is a man who was surrendered
[1:07:40] he could be trusted
[1:07:42] not taking his own will or his own
[1:07:44] desire Brothers says he loved his
[1:07:46] disciples and didn't want to leave his
[1:07:48] disciples
[1:07:49] he knew the pain that lay ahead and he
[1:07:51] would feel all of it
[1:07:54] but yet in the olive press
[1:07:57] he would be pressed out
[1:07:59] you know when you take olives and you
[1:08:02] you press them out
[1:08:04] you have to destroy the olive
[1:08:08] to get the oil
[1:08:10] because what was important is the oil
[1:08:13] the oil is valuable the oil is important
[1:08:16] so you must destroy everything around
[1:08:18] that oil to get the oil
[1:08:21] and when you want to make wine you have
[1:08:23] to destroy the grape to get the juice to
[1:08:25] make the wine and everything that's
[1:08:27] around the wine has to be destroyed in
[1:08:30] order to produce wine because the wine
[1:08:31] is so valuable
[1:08:33] and in the in the fragrance of the Rose
[1:08:35] of Sharon to make the perfume brother
[1:08:37] bear says You must crush the rose of
[1:08:39] Sharon Amen to get the perfume and you
[1:08:41] must destroy everything that's around
[1:08:44] the perfume it must be destroyed to get
[1:08:47] the perfume out
[1:08:50] are we seeing a pattern
[1:08:53] if Christ is in me
[1:08:55] if I'm part of the word by
[1:08:57] predestination by having an eternal see
[1:08:59] Gene of God if part of God Amen is
[1:09:02] dwelling in my soul that must be
[1:09:04] expressed by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:05] what has to happen to everything around
[1:09:08] it
[1:09:10] everything around it needs to be crushed
[1:09:12] everything around it needs to be dead
[1:09:14] everything around it needs to be dried
[1:09:16] up so that what's valuable can come out
[1:09:19] so the fragrance can come out the oil
[1:09:21] can come out the wine can come out
[1:09:25] and the Harvest you see so much material
[1:09:28] there but what's important is to see
[1:09:32] in the wave sheath there's so much there
[1:09:34] the stalk and the and the shock and all
[1:09:36] but what's important is the seed
[1:09:40] and in this day this bride is an eternal
[1:09:44] seed Gene of God
[1:09:46] she is part of the word for she comes
[1:09:48] from Christ she's part of she's part of
[1:09:50] the word like her bridegroom is part of
[1:09:52] the word
[1:09:54] and the word is in her Amen in the
[1:09:57] spirit to make the word live has
[1:09:59] returned to her amen but but in order to
[1:10:02] get that life out
[1:10:04] everything around it has to die
[1:10:11] we see
[1:10:13] in my opinion
[1:10:15] we see brother Branham come to adoption
[1:10:20] we even see him lifted up
[1:10:22] into that constellation of angels
[1:10:26] taken to a high mountain and lifted up
[1:10:28] before all
[1:10:30] transfigured in a way and you remember
[1:10:31] remember the dream and standing in the
[1:10:34] Gap when when uh I believe as Roy
[1:10:36] Roberson had the dream and he he saw
[1:10:37] brother Branham leave and he went out
[1:10:39] west and when he come back he had been
[1:10:41] changed
[1:10:43] he was shining and his face was shining
[1:10:45] amen I believe brother Branham came to a
[1:10:48] place of adoption where God could trust
[1:10:49] him
[1:10:51] where God could place responsibility in
[1:10:53] his hands
[1:10:54] but how did the prophet get there
[1:10:58] what was his life like up to that point
[1:11:02] brother Ben says in the Feast of
[1:11:04] trumpets it says then one day in Sabino
[1:11:06] Canyon while God called me early in the
[1:11:08] morning up there I was up with my hands
[1:11:10] in the air praying and a sword came in
[1:11:12] my hand
[1:11:13] you know that I stood there and looked
[1:11:15] at it just as natural as my hand is now
[1:11:17] not knowing what it meant and it was
[1:11:19] left me with the voice that said this is
[1:11:21] the sword of the king and then later
[1:11:22] when the angel of the Lord revealed it
[1:11:24] it was the word in the hand
[1:11:27] the word of God was being placed in the
[1:11:31] prophet's hand
[1:11:32] because he was going to come Amen to the
[1:11:35] seals and he was going to preach the
[1:11:37] unwritten part of the Book of Revelation
[1:11:40] what John was told not to write which
[1:11:42] was what the seventh under sounded
[1:11:45] the word that had been sealed up inside
[1:11:47] the pyramid amen the pyramid had writing
[1:11:49] all around it and the prophet went all
[1:11:51] around it interpreting all the writing
[1:11:54] tying together all the Loose Ends from
[1:11:56] Seven Church ages but when he got done
[1:11:57] with that he peeled the top off and
[1:11:59] showed there's something there's a White
[1:12:01] Rock a revelation inside that light has
[1:12:03] never shined on before and nothing was
[1:12:06] written on it because there was a word a
[1:12:08] mystery a truth laying in the Bible that
[1:12:11] the light had of Revelation had never
[1:12:13] shined on in this word
[1:12:16] and it was a mystery of God that would
[1:12:18] be revealed
[1:12:19] and that word that John was told to seal
[1:12:22] up that part that had been probed at for
[1:12:25] thousands of years amen that word was
[1:12:27] being placed in his hands
[1:12:30] and day by day amen the angel of the
[1:12:33] Lord would come to him day by day when
[1:12:36] he preached the seals and give him the
[1:12:37] revelation
[1:12:39] and he would come out and bring it just
[1:12:41] as he saw it he says I saw it in a
[1:12:44] vision and I take a pen and write down
[1:12:45] what I was looking at and then I would
[1:12:48] spend the rest of the day going back
[1:12:49] over the scriptures and tying it
[1:12:50] together
[1:12:51] God by Vision amen revealed the seven
[1:12:55] Thunders to the prophet
[1:12:59] the unwritten word the word of the Lord
[1:13:01] the king's sword was being placed in his
[1:13:04] hand and every day he was the man with
[1:13:07] the correct interpretation of that word
[1:13:12] and he was the one bringing the king's
[1:13:15] sword
[1:13:16] out day by day
[1:13:20] I believe God had to trust that man
[1:13:22] before he could give him that
[1:13:24] responsibility
[1:13:25] he had to be tested he had to be proved
[1:13:27] that he would be faithful before he
[1:13:29] could do that so at the end of the seals
[1:13:32] brother Brown says now don't thank no
[1:13:35] man don't say thank you to no man
[1:13:38] he said because I didn't know those
[1:13:40] seals they were given to me day by day I
[1:13:43] was just as confused as anybody else so
[1:13:45] brother I'm saying don't thank me it
[1:13:47] wasn't me amen God gave it to me and I
[1:13:50] brought it to you
[1:13:53] so God had to trust that between the
[1:13:56] vision
[1:13:57] and the preaching that that man wouldn't
[1:14:00] twist anything
[1:14:02] changing because how would you and I
[1:14:05] know
[1:14:08] between the vision of the Seven Seals as
[1:14:11] they broke day by day and he saw it saw
[1:14:14] it break before him take a pen and write
[1:14:16] it then go to the scriptures and tie it
[1:14:18] together then come and preach it
[1:14:20] how do you and I know
[1:14:23] that between the vision and the
[1:14:26] preaching nothing changed
[1:14:30] because we believe God put the sword in
[1:14:32] his hand
[1:14:33] we have confidence in God who brought
[1:14:35] him to adoption who tested him through
[1:14:37] the tutors and proved him to be faithful
[1:14:39] with the word
[1:14:42] God had to trust that man with a greater
[1:14:45] level of responsibility
[1:14:49] praise be to God
[1:14:51] so
[1:14:54] I I believe that was brother branham's
[1:14:57] adoption
[1:14:58] I may be wrong this is my personal
[1:14:59] opinion
[1:15:00] I believe that he was lifted up
[1:15:03] he was adopted and the sword was placed
[1:15:06] in his hand and he was given the
[1:15:08] authority to bring the word the the
[1:15:11] correct interpretation of the unwritten
[1:15:14] word
[1:15:14] which had to match all the written words
[1:15:18] and it did
[1:15:21] so
[1:15:23] you think about how brother M got to the
[1:15:26] place where God would put a sword in his
[1:15:27] hand
[1:15:28] and he said it fit my hand just exactly
[1:15:32] and that was the king sword it was the
[1:15:34] word in the hand in his hand
[1:15:37] how did he get there
[1:15:39] well it started way back
[1:15:42] when he learned a whole lot of lessons
[1:15:46] remember when brother Branham early on
[1:15:49] when he come in contact in Mishawaka
[1:15:51] Indiana with the Pentecostals and and he
[1:15:54] preached there he got all the
[1:15:55] invitations to go out and remember when
[1:15:57] he got home his mother-in-law said
[1:15:59] you're not going to do that you're not
[1:16:01] going to go and you're not going to drag
[1:16:02] my daughter from Pillar To Post and in
[1:16:05] order to spare the feelings of the
[1:16:06] family and not to upset his
[1:16:07] mother-in-law he digressed he didn't
[1:16:10] take the invitations president said
[1:16:12] that's when the plagues broke out in my
[1:16:14] home if you listen to life story said my
[1:16:16] father died my brother died and then
[1:16:18] eventually his wife died his baby died
[1:16:21] he said because I didn't go when he
[1:16:23] first called amen and he said go this
[1:16:25] work could have got a lot further along
[1:16:27] amen if I'd went when he called
[1:16:29] look at the price that that man paid for
[1:16:32] his disobedience
[1:16:33] and what was he doing he was
[1:16:35] capitulating to family not to upset
[1:16:37] family God was teaching him family
[1:16:39] doesn't come first I come first
[1:16:44] and and remember now he now you know we
[1:16:48] just I'm just taking Snippets from his
[1:16:49] life you could follow his life story but
[1:16:51] remember when he's preaching and there's
[1:16:53] a young couple he says Making Love on
[1:16:55] the front row kissing and hugging on
[1:16:56] each other and making a disgrace amen
[1:16:58] and and and and what they were doing was
[1:17:01] absolutely wrong and distracting people
[1:17:03] and all that and brother Brandon was
[1:17:04] upset about what they were doing and God
[1:17:06] come to him and said they're in your
[1:17:08] hands whatever you say
[1:17:10] and now he's in a place where he can
[1:17:12] pass judgment and whatever he says to
[1:17:15] them that'll be the Judgment that'll
[1:17:16] happen amen and brother Brandon even
[1:17:18] said you know if you strike them dead
[1:17:20] they'll be dead and they were deserving
[1:17:22] of judgment because they were doing this
[1:17:24] mocking right in the face of God
[1:17:26] they deserve judgment and now he's being
[1:17:30] tested because when that he had the
[1:17:32] spirit of Elijah in him but when that
[1:17:34] Spirit of Elijah was in Elisha that that
[1:17:37] uh that Elisha got angry when he was
[1:17:39] made fun of by my kids and he called two
[1:17:42] she Bears out of the woods and killed 50
[1:17:44] kids and brother Brown said that wasn't
[1:17:45] the spirit of Christ
[1:17:48] that was Elisha's own Spirit when he got
[1:17:50] angered remember because he was in that
[1:17:52] office God honored his word and those
[1:17:54] children died
[1:17:55] but now that Spirit of Elijah now post
[1:17:59] Christ is now in another vessel and now
[1:18:03] he's put in the same place judgment's in
[1:18:05] your hand amen they're making a mockery
[1:18:07] whatever you say and brother Branham
[1:18:10] says I forgive you
[1:18:12] what did he do he took the nature of
[1:18:15] Christ
[1:18:16] not his own nature
[1:18:19] what is this testing's tutorship
[1:18:21] bringing a son to adoption
[1:18:24] remember when he went to South Africa
[1:18:26] and he got tangled up with the preachers
[1:18:28] and God told him to stay in this city
[1:18:30] and keep preaching but because they had
[1:18:32] an itinerary and he didn't have any
[1:18:34] money he didn't have a vehicle he got
[1:18:35] all tangled up and had to go with the
[1:18:37] preachers and and God finally gave him
[1:18:39] permission to go but he said you'll
[1:18:40] suffer for it
[1:18:43] he went home with an amoeba that nearly
[1:18:45] killed him he thought he was going to
[1:18:47] die nobody could cure him he couldn't
[1:18:48] get any relief till God supernaturally
[1:18:51] delivered him
[1:18:52] because God had to teach him family
[1:18:54] doesn't come first I come first
[1:18:56] preachers don't come first I come first
[1:18:59] you always obey
[1:19:01] and submit to the word of the Lord
[1:19:04] look at the training this Prophet went
[1:19:06] through
[1:19:07] all the testings the rejections the
[1:19:10] mockery the the this is this is a a man
[1:19:14] as a young boy was rejected by his
[1:19:16] community was an outcast in society amen
[1:19:19] because his father was a bootlegger and
[1:19:20] all he wanted was friends he wanted
[1:19:22] people to talk to him but they would
[1:19:23] pass him on the other side of the road
[1:19:24] when he come down the road and now in
[1:19:27] the early years of his campaign he
[1:19:29] becomes the most popular preacher in
[1:19:31] America
[1:19:33] I wonder what that did for him I wonder
[1:19:36] that helped him
[1:19:39] and now all the rejection starts to pile
[1:19:42] on
[1:19:43] do you think that wasn't hard for him
[1:19:47] what was God doing he was testing him
[1:19:50] will you stay with the word will you
[1:19:52] stay with the word will you stay with
[1:19:54] the word
[1:19:56] remember when he got his wife to tell
[1:19:58] the little white lie to the lawyer about
[1:19:59] him not being in there God corrected him
[1:20:01] God come down on him what was it testing
[1:20:03] after testing improving after proving
[1:20:06] even when he failed amen God could bring
[1:20:08] him into a quick repentance and he would
[1:20:10] make it right and the man was so honest
[1:20:12] he would stand before everybody and tell
[1:20:14] him what he did
[1:20:15] what was God God was proving there is a
[1:20:18] son here that I can trust
[1:20:22] nothing improving testing and proving
[1:20:26] then even after the seals he comes to
[1:20:29] standing in the Gap we've preached about
[1:20:30] it a bunch we won't go into detail but
[1:20:31] he wanted to run away because of the
[1:20:33] rejection because of the pressure he
[1:20:35] wanted to run off and have a little bit
[1:20:37] of relief and what he wanted wasn't
[1:20:38] sinful he didn't want to do anything
[1:20:40] sinful he wanted to get away from the
[1:20:42] people and get away from the pressure
[1:20:44] and God corrected him and when God
[1:20:46] corrected him he repented and moved
[1:20:47] right back down into the ministry that
[1:20:50] caused his rejection and pain
[1:20:53] because that's what God had for him
[1:20:57] we think we've suffered
[1:20:59] we just need to watch The Life
[1:21:02] of that Prophet that man who was trained
[1:21:06] by God in the end time and brought into
[1:21:08] a position I believe of adoption and
[1:21:12] through him the word was waived over us
[1:21:14] so we could see what an adopted son of
[1:21:16] God what a bride in the end time looks
[1:21:19] like
[1:21:23] you know what God didn't wave that
[1:21:25] on 1200 tapes in a couple videos God
[1:21:29] didn't wave that so you can say wow I
[1:21:33] wish I could be like that
[1:21:35] he waved that so you would know that's
[1:21:38] the journey you're on
[1:21:40] that's your destination not to stand
[1:21:42] before crowds and discern thoughts
[1:21:44] that's not what I'm talking about but to
[1:21:46] have that surrender to Christ to be
[1:21:49] entrusted with the word like he was
[1:21:50] entrusted with the word
[1:21:56] until
[1:21:58] God could trust him with his own word
[1:22:02] and he wouldn't handle it wrong he would
[1:22:05] handle it exactly correct
[1:22:07] and I say thank God for that
[1:22:11] brother Ben says in the message just
[1:22:13] once more Lord
[1:22:15] I love this statement
[1:22:18] said if God come to me and said I want
[1:22:19] you to go to Earth
[1:22:21] and I was up there and said go to Earth
[1:22:22] I'm I'm going to give you a hundred year
[1:22:25] space of knowledge but I want you to lot
[1:22:27] your years what years you want to take
[1:22:29] the first 25 the second 25 the third 25
[1:22:32] are the last 25.
[1:22:35] what would I say well if I'm going to
[1:22:37] put my time here to be a football player
[1:22:39] an athlete or something I better take
[1:22:41] the first 25.
[1:22:42] if I'm going to here to be a carpenter
[1:22:44] or some person like that well I better
[1:22:45] take the second 25. but if I want to
[1:22:48] take to serve the Lord I'll take the
[1:22:51] last 25 from 75 to 100 because I've had
[1:22:56] the accumulation of that much knowledge
[1:22:58] I know more about it
[1:23:01] now think about this uh this this
[1:23:03] statement we know it we've heard it
[1:23:04] before but it amazes me mother bam said
[1:23:07] if I'm allotted a period of time to
[1:23:09] serve the Lord if I'm going to serve the
[1:23:11] Lord I'll take the last 75 to 100.
[1:23:15] and he picks the weakest time in human
[1:23:18] life
[1:23:19] the physically weakest and many times
[1:23:23] the mentally weakest time in human life
[1:23:26] to serve the Lord because by then he'll
[1:23:28] finally have learned something and I
[1:23:30] wonder what it is he'll learn it's an
[1:23:32] accumulation of knowledge but what kind
[1:23:34] of knowledge the knowledge of how to
[1:23:36] serve God and stay with his word
[1:23:39] forget your thinking that's why you can
[1:23:41] pick the weakest time in life because
[1:23:43] it's not dependent on your strength your
[1:23:45] mind your understanding he's finally
[1:23:47] come to an understanding it's not my
[1:23:49] mind it's not my mental prowess it's my
[1:23:51] my great speech it's not my physical
[1:23:53] strength it's all him it's not me I was
[1:23:56] just standing by when he did it
[1:23:59] so what time would he pick the weakest
[1:24:03] when everybody else would say you're
[1:24:05] nearly finished or already finished he
[1:24:07] would say no that's when you can just
[1:24:09] get started with the kingdom of God and
[1:24:11] really do something for the Lord
[1:24:13] before that you could share in the glory
[1:24:15] before that you could take pride in what
[1:24:16] you're doing but when you get to the
[1:24:18] weakest stage of your life then all you
[1:24:20] can say is it wasn't me it was him I
[1:24:22] couldn't do anything
[1:24:23] you all know I couldn't stand here you
[1:24:25] all know I had we wheeled up here in a
[1:24:27] wheelchair I've lost some teeth I I
[1:24:28] forget even what my phone number is
[1:24:32] but that's when he felt like he could
[1:24:34] serve the Lord the best
[1:24:36] oh let us take that attitude
[1:24:39] not my strength but my weakness not my
[1:24:41] ability amen but just my surrender
[1:24:47] remember don't forget
[1:24:49] in the wave chief
[1:24:51] everything around the seed is dead
[1:24:55] everything is dead
[1:24:58] seed is alive
[1:25:02] I want to read
[1:25:04] Galatians 2 20 together
[1:25:14] Galatians 2 and 20.
[1:25:28] it says in Galatians 2 20 I am crucified
[1:25:31] with Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[1:25:34] I but Christ liveth in me and the life
[1:25:37] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:25:40] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:25:42] and gave himself for me
[1:25:46] I'm crucified
[1:25:49] it's not me
[1:25:51] it's him Living Through Me
[1:25:55] if we're going to have a manifestation
[1:25:57] of the Bride in the end time
[1:26:00] which I believe we are having
[1:26:03] it's not going to be her it's going to
[1:26:05] be him in her
[1:26:09] she's going to have to learn how to
[1:26:11] surrender to yield how to die
[1:26:15] brother Brown says in perfect strength
[1:26:17] my perfect weakness said I've often said
[1:26:19] the greatest enemy I got is William
[1:26:20] Branham
[1:26:21] he's the one that gets in God's way he's
[1:26:23] the one that gets lazy he's the one that
[1:26:25] gets to a place sometimes where he
[1:26:26] thinks he can do something about it
[1:26:29] and when he does that shoves God right
[1:26:31] out of the picture but when I can get
[1:26:33] rid of that guy when I can get to a
[1:26:35] place that he's out of the way then God
[1:26:38] can come over and do things that William
[1:26:39] Branham knows nothing about
[1:26:41] that's when God can use you that's when
[1:26:43] he can use any of you he can use anybody
[1:26:47] when we get out of the way
[1:26:51] but as long as we get ourselves in the
[1:26:52] way then we cannot
[1:26:56] I think this is why Paul says I Die
[1:26:58] daily
[1:27:01] Paul knew how to keep under his body and
[1:27:03] keep it subject lest at the end he'd be
[1:27:05] a Castaway
[1:27:06] he and I knew how to Die daily he knew
[1:27:09] how to crucify himself so that Christ
[1:27:11] can live
[1:27:15] brother Ben says in the message the
[1:27:16] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:27:18] he says but you remember when it went
[1:27:20] down and the grain begin to ripen that
[1:27:22] you find before that grain can ripen
[1:27:24] everything in that stalk has to be dead
[1:27:29] Hallelujah
[1:27:30] can't you see where we're standing life
[1:27:32] is in the grain again what is it just
[1:27:35] exactly the same grain that went in the
[1:27:37] ground the same Jesus in The Bride form
[1:27:42] same power same church same thing same
[1:27:46] word
[1:27:49] what is it same Jesus in Bride form but
[1:27:53] when that seed ripens everything in the
[1:27:55] stalk has to be dead
[1:27:57] everything from a previous age all of
[1:28:00] our own thinking all of our own
[1:28:02] understanding all of our own ability has
[1:28:05] to be dead for that to fully mature and
[1:28:07] ripen
[1:28:08] until we can recognize like brother
[1:28:11] Benham that it's not me I was only
[1:28:13] standing near when he did it
[1:28:17] this is not
[1:28:19] wishful thinking
[1:28:22] this is the promise that was promised to
[1:28:24] us when God waved that Sheaf
[1:28:27] when the ministry of the son of man was
[1:28:29] waived over the world it was a sign that
[1:28:32] this crop is coming to maturity
[1:28:35] that's why he sent the word and that's
[1:28:37] why he returned because his presence the
[1:28:39] presence of the son is bringing ripening
[1:28:42] maturity to the grain all we've got to
[1:28:44] do is stay in his presence and let the
[1:28:46] word work in us and stay surrendered to
[1:28:49] it it will accomplish exactly what he
[1:28:51] sent it to accomplish
[1:28:53] this is not wishful thinking this is not
[1:28:55] someday over in the wild blue yonder
[1:28:57] this is now this is Harvest Time this is
[1:29:00] the eighth and we I believe are the
[1:29:02] people
[1:29:03] and that sign that we saw was a sign for
[1:29:07] us to have confidence in God God if you
[1:29:09] can do it there you can do it here amen
[1:29:12] whatever you did for him you're doing
[1:29:13] for me I believe by faith I'm part of
[1:29:16] the same Harvest
[1:29:18] I'm part of the same bride I'm part of
[1:29:20] the end time bride so now I can't in
[1:29:23] myself produce anything I can't
[1:29:25] manufacture I can't manifest anything
[1:29:28] that would prove anything to anybody but
[1:29:30] what I can do is die to my thought die
[1:29:33] to my own thinking under the tutor of
[1:29:35] the Holy Ghost Say Okay teach me the
[1:29:37] lesson I want to get at this time
[1:29:38] because I want to do it exactly the way
[1:29:40] he would do it
[1:29:43] I've tried my my own way I've tried my
[1:29:45] ideas a few times
[1:29:47] I've tried to improve the process
[1:29:51] I don't know if maybe none of you have
[1:29:54] but I've tried an improved method
[1:29:59] and it fails
[1:30:02] the only one that works is the tried and
[1:30:04] true process of the father and that is
[1:30:08] surrender to the word because the word
[1:30:11] always works
[1:30:15] hey we've we have human beings have
[1:30:18] tried to alter it change it we've tried
[1:30:19] to bypass it Overlook it we tried to
[1:30:22] make excuses around it we've tried to
[1:30:24] we've tried the Greek study around it
[1:30:30] but there's only one thing that's going
[1:30:32] to work I got to do it exactly the way
[1:30:34] he does it
[1:30:35] and he always works according to his
[1:30:38] word
[1:30:39] he never works outside of his word he
[1:30:41] always works in line with his word I've
[1:30:43] got to do it exactly like the father
[1:30:44] does it
[1:30:46] so now my head is Christ now to be his
[1:30:48] bride I have to do it exactly the way my
[1:30:50] head does it I have to be in perfect
[1:30:52] submission to my headship which is Jesus
[1:30:54] Christ the word and it's been restored
[1:30:56] in this day the reason the word has come
[1:30:58] back is so that we can be a proper bride
[1:31:00] because without the word you don't know
[1:31:02] how to be a bride because a proper bride
[1:31:04] is subject to her head
[1:31:06] and when the headship was obscure she
[1:31:09] was in confusion but now the word has
[1:31:10] come back so that she can be a proper
[1:31:13] bride and the proper bride is in
[1:31:15] complete submission to her headship
[1:31:18] and as much as Christ the bridegroom was
[1:31:21] perfectly submitted to the Father the
[1:31:23] bride is perfectly submitted to the
[1:31:25] bridegroom
[1:31:26] to be the proper bride and the word has
[1:31:29] come so that we can be a manifested
[1:31:32] bride
[1:31:35] well what great thing will you do what
[1:31:37] tremendous Mighty thing will you do to
[1:31:39] prove a manifested bride I think the
[1:31:41] greatest work of all that the manifested
[1:31:43] bride will produce is she will be
[1:31:45] completely surrendered and subject to
[1:31:47] the headship of the word
[1:31:50] because that's where every other bride
[1:31:53] failed
[1:31:54] and still produced works and still
[1:31:55] produce churches and still produce
[1:31:57] groups of people
[1:31:58] but I believe the greatest sign this
[1:32:01] world will see of a bride amen will be a
[1:32:04] people who are absolutely 100 percent
[1:32:06] surrendered to the revealed word of this
[1:32:08] hour
[1:32:09] and subject to her headship which is
[1:32:12] Christ Jesus the word
[1:32:15] then what God does through that is
[1:32:17] whatever he wants to do
[1:32:19] if he wants to do Mighty works and
[1:32:21] mighty manifestations and I believe
[1:32:23] we'll see some of that my personal
[1:32:24] belief is we'll see some of that but
[1:32:26] whatever he does he'll do it because
[1:32:28] he's got a vessel in subjection
[1:32:31] so the first thing to get right is
[1:32:34] surrender to the headship of the word
[1:32:36] and then all things are possible
[1:32:39] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:32:42] praise God
[1:32:43] Matthew 16.
[1:32:45] 24.
[1:32:47] I want to read two more scriptures and
[1:32:49] close with a quote
[1:32:52] Matthew 16 24.
[1:33:02] Jesus then then said Jesus unto his
[1:33:05] disciples
[1:33:06] If any man will come after me let him
[1:33:09] deny himself
[1:33:10] and take up his cross
[1:33:13] and follow me
[1:33:15] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:33:17] lose it
[1:33:18] but whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:33:21] sake
[1:33:22] shall find it
[1:33:24] like Kyle Brother Kyle said on Wednesday
[1:33:27] the Way Up Is Down
[1:33:30] the way to have life is to lose your
[1:33:33] life
[1:33:34] the way to have Victory is the first
[1:33:36] surrender
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:40] be overcome by the word to be an
[1:33:43] overcomer
[1:33:46] you remember the quote I believe God
[1:33:47] Brother Kyle read this quote on
[1:33:49] Wednesday I believe you read the quote
[1:33:50] where he says can you nail yourself to
[1:33:52] the cross
[1:33:54] remember what Jesus says take up your
[1:33:57] cross and follow me what is a cross used
[1:34:00] for
[1:34:03] execution
[1:34:05] what do they do with the cross they nail
[1:34:07] people to it to kill them
[1:34:09] so if you're going to take up your cross
[1:34:12] and follow Jesus what are you supposed
[1:34:14] to do with that cross
[1:34:16] is it you know is it a piece of
[1:34:18] furniture is it decoration
[1:34:20] no I think it's a useful Implement in a
[1:34:22] Christian Life
[1:34:23] I think a cross is necessary to serving
[1:34:26] God properly I think we must keep
[1:34:29] ourselves on the cross
[1:34:31] crucifying ourselves to our own wants
[1:34:34] our own desires our own life our own
[1:34:37] thinking our own history our own
[1:34:39] whatever I think we have to stay
[1:34:40] crucified to that to let Christ live in
[1:34:43] US
[1:34:44] that's why Jesus said take up your cross
[1:34:48] not somebody else's this is a personal
[1:34:50] cross that you're supposed to carry
[1:34:53] take up your cross and follow me
[1:34:56] let's turn to Revelation chapter 12.
[1:34:59] this is the final scripture I want to
[1:35:01] read
[1:35:08] Revelation chapter 12.
[1:35:13] and verse 10.
[1:35:18] Revelations 12 and 10. and I heard a
[1:35:21] loud voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:35:24] salvation and strength in the Kingdom of
[1:35:26] our God and the power of His Christ for
[1:35:28] the accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[1:35:30] which accused them before our God day
[1:35:32] and night and they overcame him by the
[1:35:34] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:35:36] their testimony and they love not their
[1:35:39] lives unto the death
[1:35:42] how are we going to overcome
[1:35:44] by the blood of the Lamb by the word of
[1:35:47] Our Testimony and we will not love our
[1:35:50] own lives unto the death but we will be
[1:35:52] willing to die
[1:35:56] you say brother Chad I'm willing to die
[1:35:57] I'm not talking about dying once
[1:36:00] talking about dying daily
[1:36:02] a lot of people will die for their faith
[1:36:04] if you if we come down to a showdown and
[1:36:06] it's going to be one bullet five seconds
[1:36:08] you're done no suffering I'll die for my
[1:36:10] faith but will you die daily
[1:36:14] and when you die not by an Executioner's
[1:36:16] hand but will you die by your own hand
[1:36:19] nailing yourself to your own cross and
[1:36:22] surrendering your life and becoming dead
[1:36:24] to personal desire dead to personal one
[1:36:28] dead to personal preservation
[1:36:32] we spend so much of our lives trying to
[1:36:34] protect ourselves
[1:36:36] we try to protect our emotional realm
[1:36:37] from other people we try to protect our
[1:36:39] physical being from from hurt and harm
[1:36:41] we spend so much of our life trying to
[1:36:43] protect ourselves and Christ is asking
[1:36:45] us to surrender ourselves
[1:36:47] that doesn't mean we act foolishly you
[1:36:49] know and jump in front of trucks but I'm
[1:36:51] talking about we don't need to protect
[1:36:53] ourselves he's our protection
[1:36:56] what we need to do is surrender our life
[1:36:58] to him and let him take the
[1:37:00] responsibility he's promised to take
[1:37:03] remember the government shall be upon
[1:37:05] his shoulders he's promised to marry you
[1:37:07] and take responsibility for you we don't
[1:37:09] have to take all the responsibility for
[1:37:11] ourselves we have to surrender to him
[1:37:13] and let him carry that responsibility
[1:37:15] for us
[1:37:18] trust in him
[1:37:19] lean not to your own understanding but
[1:37:21] in all your ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:37:23] Shall direct your steps
[1:37:26] this is the age of adoption
[1:37:29] what's adoption
[1:37:31] big powerful
[1:37:32] no leading up to adoption
[1:37:35] is when the sun will do it only the way
[1:37:38] the father does it
[1:37:42] I want to come to that place
[1:37:45] where I only do what the word says to
[1:37:49] what we've been given in this hour what
[1:37:51] we've been taught through this prophetic
[1:37:53] Ministry the word that has been restored
[1:37:55] I want to only do it that way
[1:37:59] God help me to surrender my life to that
[1:38:02] way
[1:38:03] and be purged be cleaned and be prepped
[1:38:06] by that word and be used for his glory
[1:38:09] and one last quote Christ is revealed in
[1:38:12] his own word
[1:38:14] the thing that matters the thing that's
[1:38:16] the matter with the message today is
[1:38:19] those who obtain it in their heart must
[1:38:21] lay in the presence of the sun to get
[1:38:23] ripened
[1:38:24] you can pick up the message and then let
[1:38:27] the sun bake all the greenness what's
[1:38:30] greenness immaturity
[1:38:32] let the sun bake all the greenness out
[1:38:34] of you see making matured Christians
[1:38:38] what is this word what has this message
[1:38:40] been given to us as restored word what's
[1:38:42] it supposed to do what's the presence of
[1:38:44] Christ supposed to do bake all the
[1:38:46] immaturity out of us
[1:38:49] till we come into His image
[1:38:52] amen I say God bake all the greenness
[1:38:57] me
[1:38:58] he realized
[1:39:01] president wasn't telling us
[1:39:03] what works to do and what Hoops to jump
[1:39:05] through and what
[1:39:07] no he was just telling us to surrender
[1:39:10] he was just telling us to give up
[1:39:13] to give up our lives to give up our
[1:39:15] thinking to stop our struggling with the
[1:39:18] word and just surrender to it
[1:39:20] stop the debate in our mind and stop
[1:39:23] struggling with the word but just give
[1:39:26] over to the word and then let the
[1:39:28] presence of the sun bake all the
[1:39:30] greenness out you don't try to become
[1:39:33] mature
[1:39:34] you don't try to do better and try to
[1:39:38] become mature amen all that effort is
[1:39:40] human effort and it will fail but what
[1:39:42] we do is we finally surrender to this
[1:39:45] Hot August Sun that's here to bake the
[1:39:47] immaturity out and then lay in the
[1:39:49] presence and quit running around and
[1:39:51] getting in the presence of other
[1:39:52] influences
[1:39:54] and get influenced by this message
[1:39:57] not by modern Trends on unpopular
[1:40:00] whatever websites and whatever uh social
[1:40:03] medias but don't lay in that presence
[1:40:05] belay in this presence
[1:40:09] and let us stay in the presence and stay
[1:40:12] surrendered to the word until it bakes
[1:40:16] all the greenness
[1:40:18] out of us
[1:40:20] we've been given a good example in this
[1:40:22] day I want to follow that example
[1:40:25] man let's all stand
[1:40:27] musicians if you'll come brother Ben if
[1:40:30] you'll come
[1:40:35] what day is it
[1:40:37] it's Harvest Time
[1:40:40] it's the last day it's harvest time it's
[1:40:43] bride time
[1:40:44] it's bright age
[1:40:46] it's time for the manifestation of Jesus
[1:40:49] Christ in the formation of the Bride
[1:40:53] that's him
[1:40:54] through us
[1:40:56] what's it going to take it's going to
[1:40:58] take me surrendering
[1:41:00] my life
[1:41:02] and dying
[1:41:03] so that everything around that seed
[1:41:06] is dead
[1:41:08] praise God
[1:41:13] oh God help me die
[1:41:17] but I'm so glad we've been given the
[1:41:19] bright light of this word
[1:41:21] the sunlight
[1:41:23] that'll do the work
[1:41:26] I don't think brother Branham reformed
[1:41:28] himself
[1:41:30] and I don't think he got himself good
[1:41:31] enough to do all the things he was doing
[1:41:34] I think he truly just surrendered to the
[1:41:37] leadership of the Lord and God took him
[1:41:38] step by step I don't think we have to
[1:41:40] reform ourselves I think we just need to
[1:41:43] surrender to the word of the Lord and
[1:41:44] let the Lord lead us step by step
[1:41:47] hey we're going to make it
[1:41:50] how do you know I've seen the promise
[1:41:52] I've the wave chief is a promise that
[1:41:56] the whole Harvest is coming to maturity
[1:41:59] I believe I'm going to make it
[1:42:02] I'm on the road now I'm not what I ought
[1:42:06] to be
[1:42:09] not even what I want to be
[1:42:11] but praise God I'm not what I used to be
[1:42:14] can you testify the same thing and what
[1:42:17] has changed you it's this word
[1:42:20] so let's stay in the presence of the Sun
[1:42:22] and let it bake all the greenness out of
[1:42:25] us
[1:42:25] man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:42:28] dear Lord Jesus I thank you God
[1:42:31] for this word that you've given to us
[1:42:33] this promised sign that you showed in
[1:42:35] the Harvest time when you displayed
[1:42:38] yourself Lord by working through a man
[1:42:41] and God you left a sign to us that we
[1:42:44] could have confidence that whatever you
[1:42:47] did to produce that there
[1:42:49] you're going to do the same thing for
[1:42:51] the rest of us Lord
[1:42:53] I pray that you'd forgive me for my
[1:42:55] selfishness
[1:42:57] forgive me for my own wants and my own
[1:42:59] desires to interrupt so much
[1:43:02] help me God to surrender in a greater
[1:43:04] way
[1:43:06] and God As We Lay in your presence when
[1:43:08] you allow the power of your word to bake
[1:43:11] all the immaturity out of us Lord
[1:43:13] with your presence Lord just change us
[1:43:16] and mature us
[1:43:17] and grow us Lord into your own image
[1:43:20] that we could be in your own likeness
[1:43:22] Lord I Thank you for the trials of life
[1:43:25] oh God they've been hard
[1:43:28] feel beat down sometimes and I feel
[1:43:30] shame sometimes in my mistakes but oh
[1:43:33] God when I look at what you did in the
[1:43:35] prophet's life I recognized them now as
[1:43:37] part of my training
[1:43:39] they're necessary Lord and I thank you
[1:43:42] for loving me enough to giving me a good
[1:43:44] tutor
[1:43:46] help me God to learn the lessons
[1:43:49] and the surrender
[1:43:51] may I stay under your headship lord may
[1:43:54] you have your way with me
[1:43:56] Lord I love you I ask that you bless
[1:43:58] each one of us may we leave your
[1:44:00] encouraged Lord
[1:44:02] that what you've already displayed is a
[1:44:04] promise what you already showed is a
[1:44:07] final result and you've given us all the
[1:44:10] ingredients and everything that's needed
[1:44:11] to come to that same place
[1:44:14] here it's in our hands help us to Avail
[1:44:17] ourselves of it Lord
[1:44:19] we love you we ask that you would take
[1:44:21] us Lord into your hands mold us into
[1:44:25] your very likeness and use us For Your
[1:44:27] Glory may you get all the glory and all
[1:44:29] the credit for it Lord may you have
[1:44:31] preeminence in this hour in each one of
[1:44:34] our vessels for we're surrendering
[1:44:36] ourselves afresh to you and Jesus
[1:44:39] Christ's name we pray
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:45] how many believes it's time for a
[1:44:46] manifestation of the Bride
[1:44:49] that's wonderful
[1:44:51] I believe that too
[1:44:53] but we can no longer believe it
[1:44:55] collectively we must now accept it
[1:44:58] individually
[1:45:01] we I agree we've believed it
[1:45:03] collectively how many believe it's
[1:45:05] bright time it's bright time you can get
[1:45:06] the whole church to shout how many
[1:45:08] believes is the adoption age when it's
[1:45:10] going to be Christ on display in the
[1:45:11] form of a bride absolutely but when we
[1:45:13] talk about that we're thinking
[1:45:15] collectively collectively collectively
[1:45:17] but you know what this is the age of
[1:45:19] individual individual individual
[1:45:22] all those statements now must be true
[1:45:25] about me
[1:45:27] it's time for me to surrender so that he
[1:45:30] can display himself through me
[1:45:33] it's so easy to think collectively and
[1:45:36] be confident collectively but we have to
[1:45:38] be just as confident individually that
[1:45:41] he will have his way with me by the
[1:45:44] Revelation he's placed in my heart that
[1:45:46] God is going to get me to that place
[1:45:49] if I can just stay connected to him
[1:45:53] what do I have to do just lay in the
[1:45:55] presence of the Sun
[1:45:57] and let him bake all the greenness
[1:45:59] amen God bless you better man that's
