happy that the bride is coming and has come face to face with him it's a personal affair it's a love affair amen he's happy to be here this morning i'm happy to be here is anyone happy praise the lord it's good to be happy happy in the lord because we're not looking at things seen we have all kinds of things to see but our focus isn't on things seen our focus is on the real the eternal things that are not seen but are more real than what's seen i'm sorry i'm just a little emotional this morning the lord's just moving over me and i just am released i'm thankful i told brother chad i got so much here i don't know how to put it together but he assured me and i know he's here and i'm thankful that he's here because you're here and i'm here because he's here amen hallelujah it has been 10 years since we lived here it doesn't seem like it the little assembly i want to bring greetings from grace tabernacle in nampa idaho some of you'd say well where's idaho further west than missouri and i just i'm real happy to be out there god sent us there to help a little assembly that was struggling and not that i was anything but i just added my lick of fire with theirs that was to burn and god has been opening his word i believe in the opened word we have a third full ministry that's drawing us into a body change it's a pull and it's a great pull and it's getting stronger all the time and i'm thankful for that open word in me in you in the bride amen and so we're just happy to be here i just bring greetings from our pastor brother paul haylett and the assembly there they bring and send greetings and also from my mother and father brother bob sister joanne dean heart and from tim and miriam so they all send their greetings so if i don't get around to you individually to give my greetings you'll know they've been you've been greeted amen and so i just send that and we're just thankful to to be here and and to just share share the love that i have and you have for our precious lord and you know the bible said we submit ourselves one to another that's because i have a measure and you have a measure of him and the body is one unit one person and so we are thankful to be assembled with that one person here in our midst and so thankful to for the word of god let's while you're standing turn with me in your bibles to hebrews 10. before i read that i have several scriptures several things the prophet said i don't plan to get to all of it but i may just quote it out instead of reading it i'm not usually one that uses overhead so i'm i'm not used to that once in a blue moon i might use that but but i just uh i'm more used to just the kind of the old way you know i'm getting older and sometimes you don't don't hear quite what you want to hear i mean with these ears and see but i'm just pressing on the upward way amen and so we're thankful and while you're you've turned to that hebrews 10 i want to title this this morning and it's a short title but i could make it a long one but it's a short one and it's this come away my love come away my love the time is now to come away our messages come away my love come up higher walk into a dimension you've never walked before amen the prophet said i think that's on the message rising of the sun he said we are or i don't know maybe that wasn't it but he said we are speaking or rapturing up to others we are the bride speaking a rapturing up to others to come into a higher realm than they've ever lived before and so this morning along with this come away my love i want you to know this of course we haven't come here to play church we've come here to meet him you didn't come here to meet me you've come here to meet him and i'm expecting and i'm expecting you to meet him even in greater measure than you've ever met him before and god is calling and i'm talking about right here this morning because we know that under our messenger this bride has become the final voice it's not another voice it's his voice god is calling for your complete perfect submission god is calling for your that's individual talking to you as individuals individual members of himself because your purpose here was to be the revelation of himself it's not another person you're not another person you are himself made manifest and so and that doesn't come through just that doesn't that's not an intellectual thing that comes by the revealing of the word through the word by the hearing of the word and god is calling for your complete perfect submission say is there a is there a possibility of having perfect submission yes sir just as much as the possibility of you walking in perfect faith there is a perfect faith there is a perfect submission amen and and we're calling and knowing in this hour we will get into this and my my meaning for this is not only to call for submission but to show you why you need to submit and show you the hour and the time you're living in to cause you and to say why not why aren't you submitting god is wanting submission complete yielding obedience submission to him and you can't do that in your own intellectual thinking you can't do that in your own intellectual your own carnal self that's why you've got to feed on the open book it's an open book brother sister and it's it's claiming you claiming me in the mystery of that and the mystery of that is the mystery of himself the full mystery of himself revelation 10 7 said the mystery of god would be finished in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god would be finished the mystery of god standing here this morning revealed he's calling you to a higher walk he's calling you to come away and submit yourself and rely completely upon him you know that man was made at the beginning to rely completely upon god completely well we're heading right back as it was in the beginning we have to we're being fully restored back to the way of what adam lost we now through the word are obtaining and receiving amen all right so i want to read something out of the church age book and i have several things here the church age book is page 16. he said that the actual revelation this book this revelation is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we'll fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people i believe that special class is here this morning that special class that one that's particular to himself that's his wife that's his bride and it can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse so that is good or quote with quote but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open lay ourselves open and become yielded lay ourselves open become yielded to the spirit to hear and know then on on and page 143 of this of the this is i'm speaking out of the i say the regular church age book there is another one that i don't know if you're aware brother george had made up okay and it's got different page numbers same wording but just different page different font okay but on page 143 he told us the evidence of what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost what would what was that we would have the teacher come and teach us all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the holy s if the spirit wasn't inside of you you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as a carnal man put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and the spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them that and they were the group that heard the messenger they were the special class of people that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it turn with me as i said in hebrews verse our chapter 10 verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he sayeth sacrifice and offering thou woodest not but a body has thou prepared me in song of solomon a body has thou prepared me i'm in that body triumphant amen verse 8 chapter 2 verse 8 song of solomon the voice of my beloved behold he cometh i wonder if that's real to you today behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills but i want to put emphasis on that verse the voice of my beloved behold he cometh verse 10 my beloved spake and said unto me individual to me not another it was to her rise up my love my fair one and come away rise up my fair one i rise up my love notice how he's identifying her in the same love my love who is she she's his love amen he is love who is she she is love amen rise up my love she's his love manifested rise up my love my fair one and come away then we'll then for lo the winter is past notice i want you to notice the time the time elohim spoke to abraham and sarah and said i'm going to visit i'm going to keep my promise and visit you this is genesis 18. in the time of life i will return in the time of life is that right all right then he said for lo the winter is past this verse 11 the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle at turtledove is heard in our land it's springtime it's seed time it's bride time the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love the other scripture in isaiah 60 said arise my arise shine for thy light has come all right arise my love my fair one and come away oh my dove thou art in the cleft of the rock the cleft is an opening of the rock the opening or the s the opening of the revelation rock is revelation the opening of the rock the cleft of the rock oh my dove thou art in the cleft of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely amen you may be seated i won't keep you standing anymore turn me to ephesians 5. i've got this lay these things out ephesians chapter 5. verse 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord notice as unto the lord paul is showing here a natural type and we'll get to it here he's pointing to christ and his bride he said wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord let me before i go any further let me just give you the the definition here of submission and submit submission is the action or fact of accepting or yielding to a superior force or to the will or authority of another person to submit is to yield resign or surrender to the power will or authority of another as we just read wives submit yourselves to your own husbands to be subject to acquise in the authority of another to thy husband's will to be submissive to yield without murmuring amen to yield without murmuring what's the scripture say for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure and this says without murmuring and let me just i just had that come let me just back off i just don't have to turn to it here let me just turn over here just a moment to philippians and read that as it would be would be read here for it is god which worketh in you this is 2 13 which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmurings and disputings you may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labored in vain amen verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything i want you to catch the spiritual context in this husbands love your wives even as christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies who is christ's body you are christ's body so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies that for no man ever yet hated his own flesh now this will come in more view as we go a little further here for we for no man ever yet hated his own flesh even as the lord the even as the lord the church even as the lord the church the lord doesn't hate his own flesh the lord doesn't hate his own body even as the lord the church all right for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones we are members of what his body right of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave father mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church amen in john 11. let me just read one more here and before we move on john 11 first john i'm sorry i know it's saint john 11. jesus is at the grave of lazarus and martha meets him and said if thou had been here my brother would not have died but i know that even now whatsoever you shall ask god god will giveth thee that's the 22nd verse 23rd jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again martha said unto him i know that he shall rise in the resurrection last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection i am the resurrection i am the life he that believeth in me he that believeth in me when were you believing in him you didn't all of a sudden become a believer in him you always were in him i'm coming in the more of these things and i said i'll read a lot of quotes now you forgive me if that is too much for you but i i just got to follow what the lord wants me to bring here and you just look beyond the man and let god speak to you through it amen and so we know that he's the he just said i am the resurrection and the life how many believe that he said i am the resurrection of the life well who's the bride she's the same life and she is the resurrection because it was the resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is is that right all right so he says he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe it sounds this you remember what the prophet said because i live you live also then we say again that what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to see that christ unveiled in you raised you have raised you did raise with him and now a manifested son and daughter of god risen in this day by the word a resurrection because he come to you personally amen you say yes he did he came to me he came to me through a prophet he came to me yes and he comes to you through his bride he comes to you through his body life comes through the body what life eternal life what's the greater works to impart life is that right what is the greater works we are here to bring the great with the revelation of what we are and that we can do the greater works now watch this same thing played out right here he said and whosoever liveth and believeth in me in me shall never die now that ought to be enough right there enough we've read right there to cause you to surrender completely to him is that right what i'm bringing here is a lot of things you say what's i got to do is submission everything because when you see your day and your hour and your position and yourself manifested in that day and hour that being the mystery revealed that's enough to submit yourself to him and we should bring a complete submission you say oh i've got this outside well this isn't you this isn't what you contact god with right here what you contact god with is through his faith he's imparted his faith in you what is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith is that right our faith who is what god's own faith whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our revelation of himself in us being who we are amen see the veil's been opened if the book hadn't been opened you are the full complete revelation of jesus christ yourself he's not complete without you the book has been opened to reveal himself completely amen the full revelation of jesus christ is the bride hallelujah amen amen all right that's a powerful statement brother david it is but it's the word for the season all right so we and whatsoever whosoever believeth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this he said she saith them yay lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister openly secretly didn't call her openly not everybody knew it she went to her personally and spoke to her what was speaking same voice that said come rise come away all right here is the voice here speaking coin going to mary her sister secretly saying the master is come hello the master is come and calleth for thee i pray that you can see that personally this morning the master has come and is calling for thee amen not calling for everybody he's calling for you he's not calling for the public he's calling you out of the public he's not calling to a denominational spirit church he's calling you out of it he's not calling he's calling you into his own self into his presence into the reality of your position and to see yourself positionally placed in him all right so he called her she went away and she called her to master his calling for thee and as soon as she heard that she rose quickly and came unto him she submitted to that word is that right she she surrendered this who's calling me my i i will come immediately she rose up and went to him hallelujah hallelujah all right the bible said in psalm 68 33 he does send out his voice in that a mighty voice amen all right so so this and this submission then your submission submissive to him is by love it's not a make-believe submission well i'll just i'll pro i'll just i don't really mean to but i'll just be i'll do it anyway no no no it's not that kind of submission we're not talking about that submission we're talking about a submission by love this is this isn't by love you loved him he loved you he loved you he first loved you amen that's why you love him and love will call will bring trust trust is submission what is this word it's a pure word his word is pure word it's a perfect word the bible said in psalms 18 his way is perfect is that right and write down two verses and he said and he has made your way perfect why is your way perfect because you're in him if his way is perfect your way can't be anything but perfect what are you going to do submit to that word well i can't figure it out i feel this and i feel that i reason this and i see this that doesn't have a thing to do with it what's the word say you take the word take him at his word the word will have to do what he said he would do it's submission amen he's calling for submission a greater submission all right so now when you obtain this message now the marriage is come how many say amen revelation 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage is come let me just read something to you the prophet said over here in the message proving his word this has been read many many times by many many preachers and it's nothing new but it's new but to me every time you read something god's always right there in it and it's brand new all right because it's an eternal word i believe that the the ministry the message of this hour is an eternal word message amen because it's the word of god it's the correct interpretation of the word of god for this season we don't have a right to add to that and take away from it if you add to what he said and take away from it you aren't submitted you are surrendered to your reasoning you're surrendered to your feelings you're not you're submissive to that you're bowing to that frankly that's idolatry a spirit of it i'm not calling you idolaters but the spirit of it anything that comes between you and god which is the word that you would bow to over the word as an idolatrous spirit amen a lot could be said on that but anyway all right we see the voice of our beloved is the voice of our head amen where does that voice manifest itself through the body all right so let us go a little further here in the message there on proving is proving his word paragraph 235 236 is it okay if i just take my liberty and read a little bit i know i know that uh you know it's just the lord has his way he knows exactly what you need individually like i said i i have these things here and probably they're about 10 sermons in one but that's the way it is all right now we say he's raised from the dead i didn't say it the word said it amen they said he raised from the dead he said he says he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last days that the same son of man will be made manifest same son of man all right now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there in genesis 18. that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts of sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus the man are you with me okay the man jesus that was not jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh amen all right it was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty showing jesus said as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed revealed as unveiled all right not no more as a church see he turned the corner it's not no more as a church not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called the bride is called see in that day the son in that day the son of man will be revealed what he said what to join the church to the head amen now the prophet said we must lay in the presence of this son those that he said the thing what's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts now this is spoken way back in 65 i believe we're up on the line here way up here i believe i believe that with all my heart there's been many laying in the presence of the sun are you with me it's not talking about infancy so much anymore we're coming into maturity [Music] and what is that maturity himself all right so see said now he said those that obtain that message in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened so who's the message what's the message and what's ripening amen are you with me remember the ministry of the bride is the same ministry of the groom not another ministry it's the same ministry all right so he said he said we've got to lay in the presence that you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured christians this is the end amen this is the end the wheat has come back to the wheat again the word has come back to the full word again the revelation has come back the son of man to the son of man again only in bride form what stumbles the people is the form he comes in it's not another person it's the same person hallelujah if the bride would be another person she wouldn't be his wife she wouldn't be bride because this bride i'm coming into it and back in the church aces again showing where you were before the foundation of the world that ought to be enough to surrender that ought to be enough to submit yourself after we get through here i trust that god will show you what it means to submit yourself to the promised word for the season that you see your hour in your time and the and the time that he promised it would be here it's not publicly known everywhere it's known to his people his bride they're the only ones that could receive it i don't say who's this bride this is bright it isn't bride i'm just glad the revelation of us in my soul but i am united with the people that know he's the same today as he was yesterday not another person she's not another person she is him in another form because it was always in him to be bride hallelujah all right so so you see we're we just this is the end the wheat's back to wheat the seeds back to the seed whatever started in the beginning has come back to itself again the shucks dried up life's moved out of the shock it's back to himself again back to this ministry of himself back to the full revelation of himself [Applause] in another form what for for a rapture for a body change hallelujah and you've got to have that change or you'll never be changed you've got to turn the corner you've got to be changed yourself it's an inside of the inside bringing the outside under obedience in fact it'll get so full on the outside you'll change hallelujah that's what's happening that's what's taking place that's why the bride just can't get enough of this word because it's who she is it's her life it's her substance it's it's everything to her specials here i appreciate the specials brother tommy's singing that that's everything i need is him that's right all right so he he says it back to wheat the wheat has come back to the grain the shucks pulled away from it the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened amen and it is ripening no question now we get back to this again improving his word the same son of man will be manifest now remember okay let me back up here i'm a little back behind myself okay not no more as church not no more the bride is called see in the day and that day the son of man will be revealed what day what day is he talking about john 14 20 said in that day you shall know let's turn over there just it's just a couple scriptures over from where i was here let's just go a minute 14 20. i'm going to read this right now but as i told the lord i don't know how to put this together let's put it he is he is doing it i know that and at that day at that day brother brahm said what day he said that's this day he said if that day you shall know not imagine not hope so it's a knowing it's substance it's reality faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you have it it's actual substance it's in you it's not something you imagine it's something you have and it brings a complete submission and rest because it's what you know no matter what anyone else says or thinks about it you know because you see the word itself is manifest to you it's become real to you it's something you know amen and it's the evidence revelation we know that faith is revelation faith is a revelation of the will of god all right if that day you'll know that i am in my father and ye in me now i'll come back to this we're going to come back to this he said and ye and me i and my father ye and me if you want to know who you are this message is telling it's a scripture right here is that right it's exactly what it's saying ye and me i and my father ye and me if you're in him and he's in his father then who are you ye and me i in you ye and me the bible said he is our habitation he is my dwelling place he is my temple christ is my temple amen all right ye and me i in you where's his temple where's his dwelling place where's his body it's you hallelujah he said how could he do that he sanctified a church that he himself could come and dwell in is that right amen he himself he comes to do what quicken that seed pour himself into you baptize you with the holy spirit baptizes that word baptizes that seed a true spiritual birth of the word amen amen and if and if he's the birth of the word there's no other place of worship but where he put his name and upon this rock i'll build my church upon this revelation of who i am then the new birth is a revelation of jesus christ in you then who are you you are that birth that's right you are that birth word amen amen amen why not submit amen and i'd say that to the bride knowing she will she has to but it's her will to do it she makes the choice because he made the choice you make the right choice because he made the right choice amen see i have a choice you do right amen but you'll never come to deny that word because you always was that word when he expressed himself he expressed you when you come face to face with him you come face to face with yourself all right so in that day you'll know that i'm in my father my you and me and i in you it's the same thing over in saint john 15 7. he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done brother branham in perfect faith said quote of this scripture he said if you abide in me and my words in you then you know who you are all right he said here the bridegroom will come right down the bride the the son of man will be revealed what for to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down amen uniting it's a union coming down union uniting with the body who is this our lord up there quickening power then let you see his coming what for he's in union with a bride amen satan hates this kind of preaching he fights this because he can't stand against the word when you know who you are there's no way he can take you out of that when your habitation is christ he can't reach his hand in and take you out you're sealed in he can't touch you he can't touch you the spirit of god that's in you did you get that who's the real you the spirit of god that's in you your enemy is dead you reckon him dead every day he's defeated you're fighting a defeated enemy but you're fighting to prove the word amen this eve won't fall like that eve did this this woman here won't fall this wife won't fall like she did is that right why she's predestinated not to she's for ordained not to she can't she never will but he's proving to satan that this word that he said and spoken is being manifested and therefore you have the answer to his devil's question it's not me that liveth that's christ in me not david him i in him he and me all right i kind of got ahead of myself a little bit there all right so what's he doing to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this the bridegroom call will come right through what this message this unveiling of himself that bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman do you see what i mean it's the son of man jesus christ will come right we'll come down in human flesh among us and we'll make his word so real that will unite the church and him as one so the head and the body are becoming one unit the head and the body are united together they're no longer twain they're one amen i got quotes on this you want me to read it but you know what he said that christ the mystery of god revealed they are becoming one amen we know that she's not another person she's the she's him the headship and the body he said what is it not them people the headship and the body has become one unit it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer twain they're one why marriage has come they're one god in his church is one he didn't point punches with that he wasn't just saying things to be saying it god and his church is one christ in you god's great revelation christ in you god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name pregnation hallelujah are you with me all right there's a union that's taken place is taking place amen and you have the token to prove it get into that a little bit here all right now you see jesus christ the son of man will come right down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real it will unite the church and him as one the bride he said he corrected it unite the church and he said the bride and they'll go home to the wedding supper because the marriage of the lamb is cuz cause the marriage of the lamb has come amen where are we heading to the marriage the wedding the marriage supper amen we on yet we are feasting we are in a feast what is it the unveiling of himself it's a seven course meal it's a revealing of himself amen amen that was only reserved for his people his bride amen amen she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already so you see then she's already she's been already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the rat when the word here unites with the person and they too become one then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen amen what is she she's himself she's his character she's his life she's himself manifested here in this hour holding forth the word of god his word this is my husband's word i have to wonder about the word it'll it'll do exactly what he said he would do amen you have an absolute a perfect absolute you just take him at his word settle in your in your mind it's finished settle in your heart it's done and go on amen all right now i want to go over here to to isaiah 22 22 and lay these things in then come over to another spot here now the bible said that this this unveiling well let's go to luke 17 just a moment before we go to that spot luke 17. these are very familiar scriptures but no matter and i'm thankful they are familiar verse 20 and when he was demanded interesting of the pharisees when the kingdom of god would should come he answered in them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation and you look that observation of course that's an outward show this revelation is not known to the public if because he doesn't marry the public he marries a bride out of the public come away all right see he's right he come when he come riding into the city of jerusalem riding into the city you know that's what the city is he come riding at the city there were those that were hated him most of them brother brahm said hated him challenged him and there was those that didn't know what to do the middle and then there was those that loved him looked for him knew him they saw him they know exactly who was coming in they saw him ride in that right i wonder if we've seen him right in amen all right so he saw him right in and they and they said well but she knew the bride knew who it was we'll we'll get back to that i'll just stop right there with that luke 17 again the kingdom of god cometh not with observation of course you say observation everybody knew it but not everybody didn't know it everybody knew there was a man come riding in but they didn't know who it was everybody saw the everybody almost everybody saw the picture of the cloud ring but they didn't know who it was amen is that right they didn't know what it meant or what it stood for you see it's not a public show all right now he said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say low here or lo there like say we spend a lot of time on these words for behold the kingdom of god the word made spirit the word made power the word unveiled in you is within you you are the kingdom of god you are his eternal possession okay we'll come back to that i want you to go with me isaiah 22 22. this is a a verse that brother branham took i think it was submergent church age reading that there went back to in isaiah and brings it up and i want to bring that out this morning under this message and it says and the key of the house of david now when i gave this title as i said the time come away my love it's and it's at an appointed time this marriage this appointed time this union as it referred back to genesis 18. and i want to also put this subject in as we turn into this the key to his house the key to his house the key also to your house now i saw that sounds strange but we'll understand that in just a minute this submission that god's calling for is a complete submission it's also subjection and separation a submission to his word is separating to him alone it's a separation to his word alone no matter what other things come whether it's feelings whether it's people's ideas people's thoughts you're separated to him alone he's the word that's your husband all right now and i and the key watch and the key of the house of david of course david was a king he was a king over the house he was and i will i lay the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut i just love that he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open i want to go back to what the prophet spoke of this in the church ages what he said of this and you'll find it if you're wanting the page number you'll find this on 295 296. now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open the spirit uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at that time is mere shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the lamp stands it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage but what does this key signify the answer lays in the position of the key it is not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that key for he alone opens and shuts and no man has that right but jesus himself isn't that right he says but where is the key it is on his shoulder but what does shoulder have to do with it isaiah 9 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder but what does in the government the government shall be upon his shoulder what does this mean the answer is this listen carefully the answer is this this the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east you see our wedding ceremony is a little backwards i won't go into all that detail i think you've probably heard that spoken here and what it is in the east but it comes from the wedding ceremony of the east i just love the way the prophet brings things back and brings a restoration forth okay it comes from the east when the bride has been committed to the groom amen when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil remember my subject here she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders what's that signifying it's signifying that not only is she under his dominion amen all right under his dominion she has transferred her rights to him all right she's transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also but also he bears i guess carly can stand still with this but also he bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of david that's the key that's the key to submission amen that's the key when you recognize who your husband is when you realize your vow when you realize you're united with him what's the key you've laid your veil you've laid everything you are you're right you're transferred everything to him amen god's just bringing us in remembrance of these things these things have been before us and with us many years those have been some of them are new here but we're bringing it to you has to be brought because it's making bringing a bride to that place to that position where she's called to be she's a sovereign herself under headship is that right she didn't come by herself he chose her you didn't choose him he chose you hallelujah all right and now you're committed you've given yourself over and you lay your veil you've transferred every right you've transferred yourself you've transferred your life you've transferred your it's not a boyfriend girlfriend relationship here brother sister it's a marriage it's not a boyfriend girlfriend relationship here it's not he goes home with you he has the finances under control he has your life under control he has your property everything is his and you're his i don't know how much better you'd want it you're his all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose trust in him with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding don't lean to this other man when you do that you're flirting with satan is that right don't yield that way don't you what's the whole what's the whole thing of the walk of a believer the path of the justice of shining light what's it all coming to a complete total perfect submission amen what's it all about god's sake look your whole the whole your whole life is under my control your whole life i already knew it i already knew about it i already had it under control i brought you here i've established you here you didn't come on your own i brought you to it he carried us on eagle's wings and brought us to where himself and when eve found adam she found [Music] herself hallelujah amen is that right her name wasn't even eve it was adam and now the restoring back is not your name isn't another name it isn't as it missed pentecost it isn't mrs message it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever of course he is the ministry he is the message but what i said there was just not some a title a message believer it's a life it's a living word this message has become you and you are the message amen amen that's why that's why satan doesn't like this revelation because he can't do a thing he can't defeat it it's already defeated him amen you're a winner no place in the bible said you're a loser you've already won you've already been caught up into his presence you're changed and you're walking day by day in his presence well i don't feel like it quit looking to your feeling look it to the word look at to the red god reveal this to me lord open it up and within me open it up to me and you'll be a strange you'll be strange but strange to who not strange to him not strange to other believers this is the fellowship we have in one ship we're in one ship we're in one body no wonder we're able to submit ourselves one to another amen hallelujah all right now so no other man no other power any other right has any right responsibility that beloved is the key of david god being sovereign he foreknew by divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own you did not come on your own he died for her he washed her in his blown blood he paid the price for her amen she he paid the price for her she belongs to him praise be to god do you belong to him in fact he said you're his eternal possession then what does that make you eternal you you well bless god you i'm talking about you the real you the birth word the revelation of jesus christ you he that's joined to the lord as one spirit you amen is that right you are that you are caught up you are caught up in you are walking in his presence you are living in his presence his presence is in you you are in him amen submitted surrendered hallelujah not so hard to submit then is it why you realize where you are and who you are and what he's already done what he's already proven his word has been time tested been time tested material and has bride been time tested material why she's the word he's the word she's the word in fact she's the word living she's the word living and in action what's the action surrender submission yielding to his will amen amen what's that do when you do that it gives you the key you've just given him the key we're coming to something here aren't we you've given him i want to point this out in the scripture you may never seen it that way and i and i'm not up here to make accolades i'm not up here to say whether you like it or don't like it i've got to preach what's on my heart and what's on my heart is the word for the season amen here he is his coming is a mystery under the seventh seal but it's not it's not unknown to his bride because it was only for his bride amen he opens it to his bride is that right why why well i all right she belongs to him and to him alone she is holy committed to him and he i love this just let this soak way down and he accepts the obligation and he accepts the obligation wonderful glorious well chad and i were fellowshipping the day and just kept saying listen lord this word is glorious i can't get enough of it that's the truth i can't either what is it it's a love affair he's pouring himself into her page 27 perfect faith he's pouring himself into her and they are becoming one anointed by the same spirit same power same spirit anointing her as the messiah of the age he said show me a church that's submitted completely surrendered to to the lord jesus and walking in that shackling glory that has thus saith the lord i'll show you messiah upon the earth he said that who do you say this is i'll show you messiah i'll show you a messiah here's one here's another here's what is it it's messiah it's the anointed word for the season you are the message of the season and no wonder you see his coming no wonder his coming is in another form it has to be to fulfill the scripture in order to come back to eden he had to come and pour himself into you it would be himself in another form it would be himself in bride form that's the scripture and then the next thing is is this third coming which is going right back into the earth again in the millennium is that right well you say what's the what's the finality of this the finality of this is you're meeting him in the air amen but you've already done met him in the air that's why you can meet him in the air if you haven't met him now you never meet him there because you have to bear his life you have to bear himself you have to bring forth it comes through you that meeting amen hallelujah if you just catch what was said right there amen that's why it means everything his picture was taken why brother braham said that's jesus christ go back and say who do you say this is he said who do you say this is it's jesus christ friends he said who is that up there who is that riding into into his into his house who's that riding into his temple who's that coming we know who it is we see our lord up there and quickening power lets us see i don't know about the others but lets me see let you see his coming my brother sister we could just go on and on and on in that one thought do you see why i'm saying we bring these things out to see that you can and you have the ability to hear you have the ability to receive the evidence of the holy ghost is that the word is revealed in you the season the time you have the ear to receive it you have an ear to hear it not ear here i point here but it's here many of you receive it here it doesn't go any further but you receive it here in order to do that you had to be that predestinated seed because we're back to seed time seed time and bride time speaks of lifetime union time marriage time the bringing forth time what's it going gonna go back to death again no not this time it's not the cycle the cycle of death's been broken it's not raising up in a in a restoration and go back to the seed again and let it go back to the seed again it's going right back into the millennium right back to eden is the way it's going because we're in the second fold of that revelation of the seventh seal [Music] praise the lord the seventh seal is not a mysterious thing it is a mysterious thing but it's not to you and i the bride amen because it's him amen it's him unveiled the completeness of his of his revelation is you it's him in you it's him as you it's him in brideform eve was adam i say eve it wasn't even her name eve casey was a mother of all living and she hadn't come to that yet so her name was adam mrs adam mrs adam was the revealed mystery of adam amen i kind of like that myself even mrs adam that's good brother chad mrs adam it's the revelation the revealed hidden mystery it was always an atom now i'm coming into another aspect let's stop just a moment and go back here and make sure we got the rest of this getting so excited i lost my place here here we are she's wholly committed he sets the obligation he is her head for christ is the head of his church his body amen abraham called him lord and the bride is happy that he is her lord he speaks and she obeys what is obedience submission you have to submit to obey amen amen amen amen it's a love affair it's a love it's it's it's a joy it's a happy joy to submit we have a perfect pure word an eternal word brother sister this isn't something that's been added to and taken from this is a perfect word amen do you believe the message is a perfect message certainly it is it's a perfect word it's bringing us right here right exactly back to a perfection absolute perfection what is th that word is perfect it's the original truth now some you have the original truth to surrender to an eternal word let's stop and think an eternal word what about this what about what about it you have an eternal word well but my feeling will live what what about about your feelings you don't contact god with your feelings you don't have your your at your confidence doesn't lay in your feelings or your reasoning or your thoughts or your thinking or your or your i mean it's okay if it agrees with the word but if it doesn't agree with the word the words your headship where are you bride rise rise come rise my love and come away rise up what a resurrection this is rise and shine amen your way is clear your future's clear oh brother david i'm going through i didn't say you wouldn't go through this you're going to have struggles you're going to have testing of trial but it's just to prove the word it's a love affair and of course that is misunderstood love amen but it's true love you go through tiles and testings and struggles that mean you have struggles they didn't know what it was when jesus said let us go to the other side i didn't know he'd meet the wind in the middle of it but he was there he's right here he's right there he's right in you he's in the ship amen oh you just get fearful over the waves and everything and all this and no no reason to be fearful he said we're going to the other side is that right and he got the evidence of it in the ship it's not some idea it's a substance hallelujah amen i'm just getting to feel like i can preach now all right now now he's he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight she's he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight just let her hear the voice of god let her hear the voice today let her hear the voice the voice of speaking come away my love arise my love and come away submit yourself to the word to me all he is you are and all you are he is how may know he said that how may know that's the truth all he is you are and all he you are he is hallelujah well it's easy to submit all right and yet it's hard to submit why because you've got an outward another another nature here that's warring against that submission but which is greater greater is he outwardly no greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world is that right then what are we judging what are we living our life by our focus what are we focused on amen all right now just remember this bride is himself revealed amen can i have just a few more minutes here okay i want to just keep going just as far as i can feel led to go here all right so he says and she loves it is her delight to obey the word he sets the members of his body he endows them with his their ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal he cares for her and guides her she is his sole property and he has no other one but her you know what let me tell you a little secret god has a wife are you one of them how do you know what's identifying that you do the token what's the token identifies that you have come through the blood that the veil has been broken and you see him face to face amen if i when i see the blood i will pass over you amen all right that token is the requirement of the hour god requires it the only thing he'll recognize is that you've come in union with him when you know you've come in union with him you you had to go into him to come in union you had to lay in his presence he was pouring himself out of himself into you they are becoming one amen all right now let's just see here talking about under that submission i'd like you to go to first corinthians 7 4. and before i go that much further there i want to read something and let's let's go to first corinthians six it's and then go right into seven first corinthians six and just before that let me read something brother branham on questions and answers 1964. the question is i can't give over completely to jesus have i an evil spirit he said let me spend the rest of the time on that you can't surrender to jesus i don't know if it's man or woman i couldn't tell what it is god knows that you can't surrender to jesus why what's the matter if you're a woman don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife surrender all you are a little lady when you're married virtuous fought all your life to stay virtuous but one day you found a man that you loved you were his completely the things that you fought against all your life and tried to live clean and clear and virtuous now you surrender every bit of it to one man is that right but you you put yourself completely in his hands you are his all that you have stood for in decency and moral and everything like that now you turn over to a man because you surrender yourself to the man can't you do the same thing to jesus christ just surrender yourself that way all that i am all my mind all my thoughts certainly i don't think you're possessed of an evil spirit i think that evil spirit anoints you with them kind of thoughts trying to make you think you cannot surrender yourself to god but let me show you something why would you want to surrender to him because there's something out there calling you to surrender so she had the desires or he or she had the desire it's not just the enemy trying to anoint you thinking you can't you wouldn't have the desire to do it that's it i hope that helps somebody all right trying to make you so you can't survive because there's something in your calling to surrender it's a very good sign that you ought to surrender yourself amen now in a message and i don't remember the name of the message but listen to this statement what a beautiful thing this is the prophet speaking what a beautiful thing it is to just lay your life in his hands and say here am i lord here am i lord just use me now lead me and guide me and direct me in the way that would be pleasing unto thee and then don't murmur no matter what the path is stay with it anyhow i like that you've committed you believe what you've done you let go you know god answers god moves in radical ways to our thinking man's thinking he moves in unusual ways ways that don't seem reasonable to our thinking but his way is perfect amen and when and when you surrender yourself like that and give himself wholly over to him then he answers many times in an unexpected place in an unexpected way in an unexpected time but he answers he'll always do it he has to keep his word see your word is your absolute amen all right so don't murmur no matter what the path is you stay with it anyhow and god will work it out all right the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord all right now let me go back over here to first corinthians 6 13 meets for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but the but the lord are you with me i'm making little points here because i'm going to come to a point in chapter 7. now the body is not for fornication but who's it for the lord and the lord for the body i had something over here too that i wanted to bring in here let me see yeah her body this is brother brown speaking in the message invisible union her body her body which is for the lord are you with me her body you know brother brahm speaking that message went natural but he's bringing in spiritual all the time all right so her body is given to her as or other words we could say his body are you still with me okay okay so i'm taking of your body too all right we find that her body is the betting grounds remember he said it's not a public show it's an inside the the the kingdom of god is within you brother branham said that he beds himself in you amen he's bedded him he bedded he bedded himself in you okay i could get that for you but i'll just i know where that is he said let me just find that because somebody might be saying that what where do you find that he said let me just see if i can't find that real quick he bedded himself okay i'm sorry just a moment um well did me just read where i was now her body is given to her a sacred trust from god the reason it's so sacred is to bring forth life into the earth her body is the betting ground of life therefore that's the reason she is given this sacred trust are you with me bride notice now we find that her body his body is the betting grounds and therefore it is a sacred trust not to defile that now i'm speaking now bringing that to an illustration to show you where the church stands amen what he said it went from luther through wesley into pentecost now into the capstone that's what followed the capstone and the church and the word become the same same thing exactly perfectly amen brother braham said when perfect word unites with perfect word said perfect word with perfect word i've got all these things and it's just i just i just don't have time to get him on but it's all perfect word now notice it's a betting ground your body is given to him amen for a betting ground of his life he beds in that amen he beds in that body well i just can't find that i'd i'll probably run across it all right now now in in going on in our reading know you not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of a harlot god forbid know you not that that which is joined unto a harlot is one body the two saith he shall be one flesh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit amen now let's go on down here to verse 19. what know you not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you what is your body it's his it's his dwelling place know you not that your body is the temple and where does god dwell he dwells in his word is not your body the temple of the holy ghost which is in you and you have of god and you are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit in your body and in your spirit which are gods amen all right we see the headship in the body has become one unit as god manifested in his people that's the reason husband and wife is no longer twain all right now amen now verse chapter 7 verse 3 let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence that word benevolence let me get that here that word benevolence means do respect do kindness giving what is due well intentioned giving what is due well-intentioned kindly respect and it says render let the husband render render means to submit let the husband submit let the husband let the husband render submit give in give in return amen so let the husband or let the menace both husband and wife here let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence and likewise also the wife render unto the husband do benevolence now you say well this is speaking of a husband and wife yes it is but let's go beyond that a minute let's go beyond it into the spiritual side of this amen you know every every scripture brother brahm said has a compound meaning nearly he said every scripture has a compound meaning and a compound revelation and so he said so the wife now verse seven the wife hath not power that word power is authority or authority over the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband amen the power the wife has not authority over her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body unless the wife gives it to him i said that for a reason he said unless the wife he has not power of his own body but the wife unless the wife submits to him how can he have authority over his body amen are you with me how can he have authority over his body she he has no power over his now his body who is his body amen and who is her body who is her body where she dwells where she's where she's dwelling where this is naturally say well that's natural but i'm going to the spiritual now brother brown said if you see you if i've watched another room and i'm in this room and you say me and my husband me and my wife my husband and i or my wife and i are one but brother branham said but christ and his church are one but he said it's not that kind of one are you with me you don't you see me but you don't see my wife but the jesus said when you see me you see my wife or when you see when you see my wife you see me because she's him she's both dynamics and mechanics she's him she's the word living she's him and he's her if you say she is him then he must be her amen are you with me so we look at this scripture here and i may just close on this rest of this i have so much i just gotta but look at here the wife has not authority of her own body her own body is his body is that right and the husband has no authority over his body amen except the wife gives it to her so the wife has to give her him authority so what is it she gives him the key to his house are you with me and he in turn by that submission gives her the key to her house and if you have the key to your house and you know who your house is then you have the benefit of everything he is are you with me all right did so so so defraud don't don't cheat one another see unless it's consent for a time there is a time you give your time what has been through these seven ages time of laying in the presence coming up through luther coming up through wesley coming up through pentecost but there come a time there come a time when there would be a union made there come a time when the marriage had to come this is seed time this is bride time this is marriage time they become one you lay your veil upon his shoulders there's never been a day like this day brother bam said there's never been a day like this he said christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing do you see where we're at look at here now let me go back here and pick up something he said there also he said you see where we're at he said and another message i got to got two messages here i have to go going back and forth on but watch watch here now he said he said there's a seed time there's something coming here he said in matthew 25 and brother branham brother branham speaking of the foolish virgin uh he said here he said he said what are these what are these chur what are these what is this shock what is this denominational thing trying to do out here well they say we need speakers with tongues we need divine healers we and brother brown said they're calling for a uh they're calling for a revival they're calling for revival they're calling for a prophet and they have not recognized he said the awakening of the bride they're they're calling for a great awakening they're calling for a great thing to come and they've not missed what's that they've missed what's come could it be they're missing what's come because he doesn't come publicly amen are you with me that's the that's the unwritten word but it's no longer unwritten to us because we found words written it's no longer unwritten to us that unwritten word of revelation 10 and that mystery of that book that john was forbidden to write why he said but the day's the voice of the seventh angel that mystery would be revealed and it couldn't come until the seventh the one that had the seventh seal step forth are you with me till that mighty angel which manifests unveiled himself in a prophet amen and spoke to his bride very directly very profoundly and said come away this is your resurrection this is your time this is your season marriage has come amen i've come to take you home and we're proceeding in that right now we're not marching downward we're marching upward right and step with the word for the season if you have a word out of season then it's out of season then the blood isn't applied correctly amen but when you have a word in season then the word comes in its season and europe because you're promised to be in this season and you're a spoken word bride and a spoken word seed you were promised to be here did you know that you know that this day this scripture is fulfilled do you realize that you're the promised word that's been promised to come here that he would meet with you and unite with you and it would be one person amen amen your headship is within you the the rock has been revealed amen it's a rock beneath the rock unveiled in you personally you hold that revelation amen and you're bringing forth the christ the mystery revealed all right now on page number page our paragraph 151 now but in this day we've had organization denomination we see where they are the nations are we see the day the promise is fulfilled let me get back this quote said what are these people trying to do get oil in their lamp talk about the foolish virgin trying to keep brother branham brought it right down to this day the cry went forth behold the bridegroom come they all rose up but then it come a turning of the corner and he came are you with me because when they started to cry we don't have oil we want some of your oil his brother said don't you realize that's when he comes are you with me now all right he said now he said here he said now but in this day there's become a super he said oh let me get back i'm trying to go ahead of myself here let me back up get oil in their lamp he said don't you realize that's an end time seed sign that's the seed sign don't you realize that this end that the the five stars have lined up showing an infant bride coming forth prior just prior to that seal's open amen and he said an infant bride is coming up coming forth this little bride brother sister down here today is not in their infancy amen i'm not saying that to separate anybody you may you may have just given your heart to the lord but you're growing amen you're coming up you're going forward you're moving forward amen you're walking just keep walking keep walking in the light god will take care of the rest of it just keep walking in the light all right so you see he said now there's to come but now i keep wanting to go back there that's the end time seed sign he said amen and while she was trying to do that get oil the bridegroom come and the bride went in this is what's been taking place and she foolish virgin without oil nothing to nothing to quicken takes it takes the dynamics upon the mechanics oh she had the word i'm talking about the word now watch what i'm saying she had but she lacked revelation she lacked the holy spirit she lacked oil i say she had the word intellectually amen are you with me all right she she come up under that she come up why sure i believe a prophet sure i believe his message but never had a revelation of it all right she was trying to get the revelation trying to search trying to get it trying to buy oil all right now but watch he said there come a so he said now she was locked out oh he said brother brown said oh what a wonderful day we're living in what a wonderful day we're living in he said you say you call that a wonderful day yeah it's a wonderful day we're living in he says now the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley through the baptism of the holy ghost the pentecostals and go right on in into the perfection of the son of man capstone okay perfection the son of man when the husband and wife will be the same self person god will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one he says now you see where we're at now you see where we're at all right now let me go back here the day this scripture is fulfilled that's a powerful little message i love that message he says now but in this day now he said in this day there is to come a super royal seed of abraham that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son as i spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raise up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son she's to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise given to her amen amen amen and we can go through those promises and scriptures which we do amen but who do you say this is it's our lord up there but it's our lord in here amen who's he united what's he come to do unite invisible union all right so getting back to that you see that that seventh chapter there of or verse four and so there come an appointed time there come a time there come a time there was for a time with prayer and and fasting but there come a time when the bridegroom come in the midst how can the how can the children fast when the bridegroom's here are you with me you see what i'm trying to get across here now see see so he said and that's okay that's physical that's you should be in the word there's a time i'm not i'm not i'm not denouncing any of that at all what brother paul was saying here but just like romans 7 brother branham said when he preached invisible union now this speaks you'd think of of of a marriage in divorce but he said it's deeper than that right this is deeper than this there's some because paul even said i speak concerning christ in the church in ephesians 5. there was a deeper subject there was a deeper reality was showing us here see in that scripture amen i show you a great mystery we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and the word today is becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming the word that's why when christ is in you it makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing now we see the promise being fulfilled now we see the promise being fulfilled christ the true headship going in coming in coming in going in coming in hello do you see the promise being fulfilled this day this day i'm fulfilling scripture this day this scripture is being fulfilled now we see the promise brother branham was making it very clear this promise is being fulfilled there has to be a promised word there must be a bride there must be one there must be those two must come together see they've got to be one you see her you see him you see him you see her what is it what is what is that from submission when you submit to him he gives you the key to to to his house to your house your house your house everything he has in your house in everything you have in your house because he's your house you see no cut no plague can come now you're dwelling because he's the dwelling you're in him you're in him go back to psalm 91 see if if it's not he's not our habitation he is our habitation is that right we we dwell in him he and us now you know who you are now you see the day in your hour you're living here now you see the resurrection message now you hear the voice of the resurrection arise my love come away let's stand i'm going to stop right there i can a lot more weak go on and i probably miss things and i'll probably get home and look at oh i wish i said that i wish i'd have said that can i just take one little matter while you're standing just to change there's one place i have to come to and that's page 149 onward for about three pages i thought you were done brother david i was until god reminded me all right that's the truth remember i was going to go back to pick up your pen and write but just keep this in mind he now works in and through his bride he now works in and through his pride and she knows that amen and when she knows that she submits to him amen all right he now works in and through his bride for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride the work that he's left for this specific time amen the bride can only do his will she does nothing else you can't make them do otherwise they have saith the lord or keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works now a lot could be said the secret is the words in the bride amen amen oh my amen and the harmony that's to exist amen that's another sermon still the same one but another one i'd say we could make a lot of parts out of this all right but there is one place i want to get to and that's that's uh page 149 and on a little bit there let me listen carefully and i don't know why god kept this to the last because i had it at the first but as we quoted before st john is it okay if i just go a little bit might just be seated again we'll keep you standing you see that's unusual for a preacher to do that no it really isn't most of them would just keep you standing but listen i want you to catch this let me just end with these things and this ought to solidify it right here what's submission how to submit what to do you have not chosen me but i've chosen you now brother i'm going to steal your thunder a little bit because we were talking about this and i i just had to bring this in so we're just gonna have to okay now it's a quote brother brother chad probably knows where i'm going with this the purpose of god according to election romans 9 11 said it it says the purpose of god according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose i just love this the heart purpose the eternal purpose you were brought here on the earth under an eternal purpose did you know that you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you think the devil's going to come and take you out of him now you were chosen in him amen and it and he's purposed your walk and your calling and your positioning in the body he purposed it but the heart purpose i don't want to get to preach on this let me just read okay you're still pulling the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god i just could take his focus on that statement was to take a bride here's the read here's what it was was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and that purpose was in himself being eternal being eternal himself being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world now watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of stardust before god was god god is an object of war adoration and no one was there to worship him so he so he was at that time only potentially god you'll have to excuse me my when i preach my nose runs i hope that's not turn the mic down brother okay he did good all right now turn it up okay now watch carefully see he was at that time before god was god god is an object of adoration worship and be and and and before that he and he was at that time only potentially god he was known only as eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of god notice what it's the thoughts of this bride existing in his thoughts was in the mind of god and those thoughts of god thoughts of god now god has thoughts he's all kind he knows all things but he has thoughts of himself eternal thoughts all right okay and so and what god and what about those thoughts of god they are eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of god now he identifies what he's talking about here the eternal thoughts of god let me ask you are the thoughts of god eternal he said if you can see this you will see many things god is unchangeable in both essence and behavior oh my and he's going to have a bride of his own character she's going to be him we have studied that and when you wonder why you go through testings and trials he's bringing out his character we have studied that and proven that already god is infinite in his ability so therefore god he is as god must be omniscient he's omniscient he is now learning he is not now learning nor has taken counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge he can add to it he if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but not that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought amen he never had a new thought about you all right but about he's never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and now and knows the end from the beginning because he's god thus the thoughts of god are eternal they are real they are not simply a man with blueprint that he is he is not simply a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of god now i'm going to skip down here now it says he hath though he had chosen us in him remember the heart purpose the very heart purpose of god was to have a bride that was already existing in his thoughts of himself so those thoughts of the bride are eternal all right now it says he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that means that we were right with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world that gives that that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that but let us go on these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of god now notice what he said the elect were the eternal thoughts of god not only were they the eternal thoughts of god which were you'd realize you're the eternal thoughts of god so god can't be complete without those thoughts being manifested made made substance made tangible all right these elect were not only the eternal thoughts of god which would be expressed in flesh which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season here we are but these same elect are called by another name what is it he said therefore it is of faith that it be by grace that the end of the promise might be made sure to all the seed not only to that which is of the law but that which is of faith of abraham all right amen now and if you be in christ you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise amen now i mean just skipping forward here save time these who are of the royal seed are the elect of god the predestinated fore known of god and we're in the mind of god and in his thoughts in very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed amen it became expressed a spoken thought what was the message to do it was expression speaking you into existence all right okay thus the true bride was in the mind of god eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word original seed remember thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride and though she is feminine designation she's called the body of christ she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and now manifesting god in a many-membered body where once god was manifested in one member even the lord jesus christ amen amen we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn amen amen oh so much more let's stand amen god bless you thank you for being here thank you for hearing amen if the musicians would come i think they're already come all right praise the lord i hope some way this has helped inspire you god is calling for your complete submission a perfect submission and why not there's no reason why not amen you see what he is you see the day you see the hour you see where you're at and he's present he's here he's come and coming amen are you with me amen well praise the lord amen i'm not i've i'm almost got used to being people with masks on our church we don't need masks sorry but it's not mandated in idaho and so we we've been pretty free that way but i guess wednesday you'll be able to come in here without them but i heard your hallelujahs there you go amen praise the lord do you love him i just have a few songs let me just look back here and see i got a couple that we could sing and i didn't finish this message you can't finish it i just gave as much as what i felt the lord to give me so god bless you trust we can meet we'll meet again trust we can meet again on this side as the lord leads i have a song here i want god's way to be my way you know that song i want god's way you want god's way then just surrender because he has the way he's given you the key you place your key on his shoulders you place the key to his house you've given him authority [Music] and now he gives you the key amen to your house and what a fountain to drink from what a joy to partake of amen what a fellowship what a oneness what a great peace whose mind has stayed on the lord you'll give them perfect peace aren't you with are you happy god bless you thank you brother chad for allowing me to minister i was nervous but i'm glad god had his way amen that's what he always does what might seem

though the road be steep and rough if he then he is [Music] he promised that i want god's way to be my way every day again i want god's way to be my way [Music] that a child of god should [Music] is

praising my savior all the day long this is my story [Music] this is my song [Music] raising my say [Music] before we sing the next verse let me leave you with this this scripture second corinthians chapter 3 verse 15 verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn speaking of the heart to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit i think [Music] thank you lord where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face unveiled open face we see our face we see his face an open face but we all with open face see the perfect is come brother sister we're not hid we're not looking through a veil we're not looking through a glass darkly we see as he sees us we all with open face beholding is in a glass that's like a mirror the mirror the glory we're beholding the glory of the lord our change what are we beholding who we are beholding is in the glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory revelation from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not amen amen and then it goes on to say if our gospel hit us into them to the lost we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts this god the same one to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face or in the person of jesus christ we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us god bless you let's go ahead and continue singing that song [Applause] [Music] [Applause] visions [Music] from [Music] whispers of love [Music] this is my story this is my song [Music] praising my savior [Music] this is my story this is my song praising my savior all the day long hallelujah how many want to submit everything you have i want more than ever just to submit to him i was so edified by the word this morning and when he said sit back down i said amen i don't ever get to sit and feed you know i didn't ever want it to end i was on the on a happy side for me today and i just appreciated the word and what it did inside of me and how it's awakening us layer by layer word by word it's waking us and i was thinking there's so many thoughts that i had while i was preaching and so many things were tying together i love it when the preacher he's not just filling time so he can close the service but he can't find the stopping point there's so much because everything ties together when you see that there is one mystery of god all the mysteries are telling the one mystery and the mystery of god revealed and when you see the whole mystery of god revealed you see the unveiling of god where do you start and where do you stop it's all the same story he said there's many parts of this it's just the same sermon you change the title you go to different places in the scripture different parts of the message but it's all the same sermon friends it's the it's the hour that we live in but he said god's purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing and that bride he was going to choose was going to have his very character that's why he placed his life inside of her and when when god came in the form of his son jesus christ he displayed the character of the father was displayed in the sun and the son displayed the character in perfect submission he only did what the father showed him he only operated according to the word and so when his bride manifests what kind of character will she have she will only do what her husband shows her and what her husband shows her is the revealing of the word so it's just the same story the same life in another form a continuation of the same unfolding of the mystery of god and he and now he and she in this message submission when he was talking about submission it's amazing it began to strike me in my seat that that satan had victory we've talked about as many times but satan came in by deception by getting the woman to leave her headship he got victory in god's eden so god is now going to come and through the woman have victory in satan's eden and the devil got victory by a woman who who failed in submission and took her own thinking contrary to the headship of the word but now he's going to reverse it and reverse everything that was done wrong there by having a woman who would come in perfect submission to headship and never take her thinking over the word it's the same story flipped on its head now in satan's eden and that's how he's going to have victory through the woman it's him through her and now she's going to display the same character and it's going to be perfect submission to the full revelation of the full word and she will no longer take any man's idea or her own idea or emotions or thoughts or traditions or histories or a church or anybody else she's just going to take the word and the word only and it's going to reverse the whole thing that was upset in the beginning we're going to come back to a millennium come back to an eden i thought it's amazing how satan got the victory in godzilla and god's going to get the victory in satan's eden but which age is he's going to do this in he's going to do it in the laodicean church age and the laodicean church ages people's rights and in the time of people's rights he's going to have a people who will give up all the rights to the headship of the word oh god is so perfect he loves the contrast and he loves to show himself in the contrast and under the time of people's rights it's actually a display also of god's choice to put himself in partnership with man by free moral agency and what is free moral agency your right to choose is that right and god has subjected himself to this law of free moral agency and so when you begin to look at people's rights and god giving people a right then you realize it's my right to surrender my rights to him and nobody can take my right away from me it is my god-given right under free moral agency it is my right in the face of a laodicean church age that says people write it is my right my privilege my joy my pleasure to give all of my headship to him and nobody can take that right away from me people have tried to pressure people to submission they've tried to force submission and this is not an issue of for submission this is a free will offering i want him to have me and i want to give all of myself to him the now in the face of people's rights it's my right it's my choice to exercise my free or moral agency that god gave me and it's my right to lay down my rights and to lay my veil on his shoulders and choose him as my head and nobody's going to take that from me i do it willingly i do it with joy i do it with rejoicing there was something that brother david said that struck me so hard when he's saying it he said yielding to the outer man yielding to the outer man because this is the old husband that's supposed to be dead yielding to the outer man is flirting with the devil wrecking you there therefore yourselves dead let the dead stay dead that you can have life the outer man is everything you see taste feel smell and hear your memory reasoning conscience and affections let us all die and let's not flirt with that outer man but let's stay unified with the headship of the word which is in the inner man and continually submit to him i love the way brother david preached he didn't preach a for submission he didn't preach submission in the way that if you don't submit you're going to hell if you don't submit you're not bride what he preached is why not what do you have to lose you have everything to gain nothing to lose why not submit and in the face of the picture that the brother painted this morning there's nothing in me that's resisting there's nothing in me that wants to resist there's nothing in my soul that wants to hold back i want him to have all of me i want him to have more of me than he's ever had i want the outer man deader than it's ever been and i want the inside man to be united with christ more than it's ever been it's our heart's desire it's what's already in us he already placed inside craving he already praised the faith on the inside and the word is coming and peeling away all the false so that the true can come bubbling up and say that's what i've always wanted is that kind of relationship with him oh i appreciate the word how many of you will be praying for brother david he'll be here i think for another week or so and then be traveling home and just pray for him i enjoyed what the lord laid on his heart let's just bow our heads and pray and thank the lord oh lord jesus i thank you i thank you god for the word that you've brought in the picture that you've painted the invitation that you've given to us lord because you've never wanted force lord you've never won in forced relationship you're not a barbarian or a beast lord that would take a woman and just grab her by force and force her lord to be a wife but you were looking for a wife that would reflect your character and your character with submission yielding to the will of the father and you're looking for a bride that will have that same character where you can just present yourself and give her the option you're looking for that one that'll say i want you i want you to have all of me i don't want anything else or anything in the past or anything that i thought i i lay it all aside and i just want you that's the bride you're looking for that was the bride of your own choosing that was your thought from before the foundation of the world and now it's being expressed in your bride upon this earth let it be expressed in me oh god as i yield to you lord as i surrender my thinking my dreams my ambitions my wants lord all my ideas lord as i all my affections and emotions if i surrender it to you the living word the revealed word i pray god that you would come and wash me with the washing of the water of your word to wash away all the filth of the prostitute spirits that we might be a clean virgin pure bride united to you god it is our right to exercise our right of free moral agency and i want to say lord in your presence that i choose to surrender my rights to you god forgive me for flirting with the outside man of reasoning and emotion affections and memory forgive me for being fearful because of what my eyes see or my ears here lord forgive me as i repent of that i pray to wash it from me lord cleanse me by your blood and wash me by your word take me lord and to yourself as i give you myself have your way with us lord we want to unite with you in a greater way than ever before open our eyes lord that we might see we ask lord a special blessing on our brother david and his family as they travel visit minister use him and blessing encourage him lord for he's encouraged us god continue to keep us in this path of righteousness for your name's sake we give you preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray amen in the song here i am lord here i am lord here i am [Applause] [Music] r lord here i [Music] am [Music] [Applause] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] i give all myself to the lord here i [Applause] [Music] am lord here i am [Music] you know he said arise come away why did he say arise because she was sleeping and in the laboratory and church ages they were all sleeping so he had to start with a resurrection arise and then a coming away and for us he had to raise us out of dead denominationalism and bring us into a rapture and so now we've resurrected and now we're being raptured as we walk with him in the rapture arise and come away oh what a day we live in this is the day of the arising and the coming away let's sing this song together [Music] come away [Music] my [Music] there's a table to rest and linen a banquet is prepared a host of angels gather for the celebration there [Music] [Music] begins to say [Music] come away my [Music] but i could give to you my name eternity awaits us come away [Music] i loved you from creation long before you that came with me all the way to calvary and though it wasn't over when they laid me in the tune i proved my love would never die i rose again for you [Music] come away [Music] my love come away my love [Music] i have waited for this day when i can give to you my name eternity awaits us
