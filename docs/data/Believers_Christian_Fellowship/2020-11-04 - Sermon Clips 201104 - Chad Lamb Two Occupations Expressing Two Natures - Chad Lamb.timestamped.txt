[0:00] and abel now is attracted to the sheep
[0:03] amen and you see that god had made
[0:05] garments for his children
[0:06] but you think about the boys as they
[0:08] come out amen they become
[0:10] infants and and now amen we know that
[0:13] clothing had originated and they start
[0:15] to wear clothes and and they start to
[0:16] grow up
[0:17] and now you wonder uh cane
[0:20] what what would adam and eve have made
[0:23] their garments out of
[0:26] they already tried the vegetation and
[0:28] that was curved that didn't work
[0:31] so so this is just brother chad but i
[0:34] would think that they would repeat what
[0:35] god did
[0:36] [Applause]
[0:38] and adam knew what the covering was and
[0:41] he would cover his boys
[0:44] one was his one was just living in the
[0:47] house
[0:49] and so abel abel year after year
[0:52] he was experiencing this covering
[0:55] amen and mom and dad have to be covered
[0:58] and all of a sudden it's important that
[0:59] we're covered
[1:00] and it's necessary that a lamb is
[1:02] covering us and
[1:04] and all of a sudden abel i mean there's
[1:06] something attractive in this to abel
[1:08] and abel's attracted to the sheep he's
[1:11] not attracted to the cursed ground
[1:13] he's not looking to build a bigger
[1:14] kingdom he's not looking to gain or
[1:16] possess
[1:17] he's not all he's doing is taking care
[1:20] of what god has provided for his
[1:22] covering
[1:22] he may not understand it all yet but
[1:24] he's experiencing it
[1:26] he's covered in it it's covering for him
[1:28] amen is his dad
[1:30] sees that it's important that you're
[1:31] covered in this lamb and now he's going
[1:33] to take care of the thing that's
[1:35] covering him
[1:37] the thing he's interested is the thing
[1:38] that's covering him because we're
[1:40] clothed in the word amen
[1:42] the spotless word and the righteous word
[1:44] of god and now the able
[1:46] nature amen is a shepherd nature who's
[1:49] caring for the very
[1:50] thing that's covering him
[1:54] the the the thing that covers him was
[1:56] the lamb so now he's going to take care
[1:58] of the lamb
[2:00] because the thing that covers us and
[2:01] washes us and purifies us
[2:03] and removes sin from us is the blood of
[2:05] the lamb it's the lamb it's the life of
[2:08] the lamb it's the word of the lamb
[2:09] the lamb is the word and now
[2:12] we become shepherds of the word
[2:16] we love the word amen not the cursed
[2:18] world not the cursed earth but we love
[2:21] this thing that's covering us
[2:23] we love this thing that is a substitute
[2:25] for me the thing that covered for me
[2:27] paid my price covered my sin is the
[2:29] thing that i'm going to give
[2:30] all my life to and i'm not going to
[2:32] change it manipulate it
[2:34] force it all i'm going to do is care for
[2:36] it
