[0:00] I have a home prepared where the saints
[0:04] abide
[0:06] just over in the glory land.
[0:11] And I long to be by my savior side. Just
[0:17] over in the glory land.
[0:21] Just over
[0:24] in the glory land. I'll join the happy
[0:30] angel band. Just over in the glory land.
[0:37] Just over
[0:39] in the glory land.
[0:43] There with the mighty host. I'll stand
[0:48] just over in the glory land.
[0:52] Well, I'm on my way to those mansions
[0:57] fair. Just over in the glory land
[1:03] there to sing God's praise and his glory
[1:07] share
[1:09] over in the glory.
[1:11] Verse three. And what a joyful song that
[1:16] my Lord I'll sing. Just over in the
[1:20] glory land.
[1:23] And with kindred save there forever be
[1:29] over in the glory. Verse four. And with
[1:34] the blood washed strong I will shout and
[1:38] sing. Just over in the glory land
[1:44] that in us to Christ the Lord and King.
[1:49] Just over in the glory land.
[1:54] Just over
[1:56] in the glory land. I'll join
[2:01] the happy angel man. Just over in the
[2:06] glory land.
[2:09] just over
[2:12] in the glory. Then there
[2:17] mighty host I'll sing just over in the
[2:21] glory.
[2:25] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[2:29] passing through. My treasures are laid
[2:32] up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels
[2:37] beckon me from heaven's open door. And I
[2:42] can't feel at home in this world
[2:45] anymore.
[2:47] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:51] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[2:55] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[2:59] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[3:03] feel at home in this world anymore.
[3:08] And they're all expecting me. And that's
[3:12] one thing I know. I fixed it up with
[3:15] Jesus many years ago. I know he'll see
[3:20] me through. Though I am weak and poor
[3:24] and I can't feel at home in this world
[3:28] anymore.
[3:30] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[3:33] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[3:38] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[3:42] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[3:46] feel at home in this world anymore.
[3:50] Just over in glory land we'll live
[3:53] eternally.
[3:55] The saints on every hand are shouting
[3:58] victory.
[4:00] The songs of sweetest praise drip back
[4:03] from heaven shore. And I can't feel at
[4:07] home in this world anymore.
[4:11] And oh Lord, you know I have no friend
[4:15] like you. If heaven's not my home, then
[4:19] Lord, what would I do? The angels beckon
[4:23] me from heaven's open door. And I can't
[4:28] feel at home in this world anymore.
[4:32] And oh Lord, you know I have no friend
[4:35] like you. If heaven's not my home, then
[4:40] Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon
[4:43] me from heaven's open door. And I can't
[4:48] feel at home in this world anymore. And
[4:52] I can't feel at home in this world
[4:56] anymore.

[5:08] by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[5:13] And I'm waiting for this outward to be
[5:17] changed and taken off of this earth. Oh,
[5:21] this power now is moving.
[5:26] It's deep inside of me.

[10:37] Solomon
[10:38] concluded
[10:40] all was vanity.
[10:46] Now my heart believes that it is true.
[10:55] It took me all this time to find
[11:00] reality.

[11:15] All that really counts,

[24:36] Amen. Let's bow our heads together this
[24:39] morning.
[24:41] Oh God, how we marvel at your love for
[24:43] us, Lord.
[24:45] Oh, as the song we just sang sings,
[24:47] Lord, even when we've strayed away, even
[24:51] when we were lost and blind and our
[24:53] minds were clouded and we were enemies
[24:56] in our minds, you come and found us,
[24:59] Lord. You found us like you found the
[25:02] woman at the well in Samaria. Lord, you
[25:05] had needs to go by, Lord. And for each
[25:07] one of us, there was a time you had
[25:09] needs to come by our way because you
[25:12] knew us from before the foundation of
[25:13] the world. You predestined. You loved us
[25:16] from before. And that love is never
[25:18] ending. Lord, it can never fade. It can
[25:21] never fail.
[25:23] God, even now, Lord, when we make our
[25:25] mistakes and when we fail you, you've
[25:27] never failed us. Well, we love you so
[25:30] much and we're so grateful that you've
[25:33] gathered us together again for the
[25:35] privilege of being here, Lord, with the
[25:38] saints, Lord, with your children like
[25:40] precious faith as we can come together
[25:42] to sing your praises. It's a joy. It's a
[25:45] thrill to our hearts to the privilege to
[25:47] lift our voice cuz rocks will not cry
[25:50] out in my place, Lord. But let me do the
[25:52] praising. Let me do the worshiping. Let
[25:54] me declare your glory, Lord. never want
[25:57] to rock the substitute what I have the
[25:59] privilege of doing today. Speak of your
[26:02] greatness. And God, as we come to the
[26:06] portion of this service where we look
[26:07] into your word, Lord, we can't do it
[26:09] without you, Lord. We've got to have the
[26:12] eyes sav. We have to have eyes to see
[26:13] and ears to hear and a heart to
[26:15] perceive. Lord, if you give us the
[26:18] spirit of knowledge and wisdom and
[26:20] revelation, Lord, and open to our
[26:22] understanding, to understand the
[26:24] scriptures, to see them, Lord, to have
[26:27] them revealed to us. Lord, we pray that
[26:30] you would open our ears and open our
[26:32] hearts. And Lord, that I pray you'd open
[26:33] my mouth and you would speak your
[26:35] eternal words through these lips of clay
[26:38] for we are utterly dependent upon you.
[26:41] Lord, be praised and be blessed in all
[26:43] that we say and do as you take your
[26:45] preeminence among us. We ask it in Jesus
[26:48] Christ's name. Amen.
[26:51] Amen. Isn't he good?
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[26:55] seats. Thank you, musicians. I've got a
[26:57] couple of announcements I'd like to make
[26:59] right off and I always enjoy making.
[27:01] There's certain kind of announcements I
[27:02] really like making and some of you know
[27:04] some of my favorites. So, we got two of
[27:06] my favorites today. So, the first one is
[27:08] a baby announcement. As you most of you
[27:10] know, early Thursday morning, Brother
[27:12] Riley and Sister Abigail Sanders
[27:14] welcomed their little baby Mildred Rose
[27:17] Sanders came into the world and her name
[27:19] is Little Millie. Amen. I think that's a
[27:21] super cute name. They're going to call
[27:22] her Millie. So, we just want to thank
[27:24] God for a safe delivery
[27:27] of this baby.
[27:30] And I know the nurseries are full and
[27:32] Sunday school classes are filling up,
[27:34] but that's a good problem to have.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a good problem to have.
[27:39] Amen. So, thank God for them and we're
[27:41] happy for them and they're doing really
[27:43] well. And I also have an engagement to
[27:45] announce. That's another one of my
[27:47] favorite announcements. And so, uh, if
[27:50] we could bring up the picture there,
[27:52] Sister Mida Bondo is engaged to be
[27:54] married to a to a brother in the Congo,
[27:56] Brother Colombo. So, we're very very
[27:58] happy for Sister Me and the Bondo
[28:00] family. Want to congratulate him. Amen.
[28:06] Amen. They haven't set the date of the
[28:08] wedding yet, but they've uh they're
[28:10] they're official. Amen. And uh she's got
[28:13] to finish some of her documentation here
[28:14] for permanent residency. So, but she's
[28:17] going to go to Congo to be married and
[28:19] to live there, but she wants to get her
[28:20] documentation done here. So, it's easy
[28:22] to come back and forth, and they have
[28:24] options in the future. So, just pray
[28:26] that all of that goes smooth for them
[28:28] because I'm sure they don't want to wait
[28:29] forever to get married now that they're
[28:31] engaged. So, we'll just pray for them.
[28:33] Amen. I also want to remind you of the
[28:36] um uh the Labor Day picnic tomorrow at
[28:39] brother Benjamin and Sister Manda
[28:41] Seabolt. So, we appreciate them always
[28:43] being so gracious to uh lend us their
[28:45] property, invite everybody over, and so
[28:47] we look forward to seeing you all there.
[28:49] And and I thank God for the weather.
[28:51] Amen. It's looking really, really
[28:52] spectacular. Amen. Also wanted to let
[28:55] you know and remind you, you heard it in
[28:57] the prayer request, but our brother
[28:59] Wesley will be getting married next
[29:00] weekend. So we're very very happy for
[29:02] him, for sister Anne. Their wedding will
[29:04] be in Connecticut. So my wife and I will
[29:06] be traveling out there to be part of
[29:08] that to enjoy that time with them. And
[29:10] so there won't be any afternoon
[29:12] communion service next Sunday even
[29:14] though it's the first service of the
[29:15] month. And also brother Danny Delmundo
[29:18] from the Philippines will be here
[29:19] preaching. So just keep him in prayer
[29:21] and we look forward to that. It's
[29:22] bittersweet for me because I will miss
[29:24] him entirely. He comes and I miss him on
[29:27] the coming and I miss him on the going.
[29:29] So, that's a little bittersweet, but I'm
[29:31] glad he'll be here to minister. Amen.
[29:34] God bless you. Let's stand together and
[29:36] take our Bibles. As you stand, I just
[29:38] want to welcome a few visitors. First, I
[29:41] want to make an official welcome to the
[29:43] Fielding family that's moved here from
[29:45] Arizona. Amen. They're all together. We
[29:47] just want to greet you and say, "God
[29:48] bless you."
[29:50] We
[29:52] got to meet Sister Jacqueline a few
[29:54] weeks ago. She came with the four
[29:55] younger children, but Matthew had to
[29:57] stay back and finish things. and he came
[29:59] while I was gone and and then he they
[30:02] weren't able to make it Wednesday when I
[30:04] was here. So now we're all here
[30:05] together. So this is official welcome.
[30:07] So God bless you. I want you to feel
[30:09] very welcomed and at home. Also, Brother
[30:11] Randy and Sister Anna Lungsford are
[30:13] visiting with us again. So God bless
[30:14] you. It's always good to have you. And
[30:17] um and also I saw Rebecca Holapo has her
[30:19] sister and her family here. So God bless
[30:21] you. It's good to have you here from
[30:22] Edmonton. So we got a lot of visitors.
[30:24] Amen. And uh we got a special visitors
[30:27] from Missouri. Uh brother Brandon and
[30:30] Sister Charity Wood come from Missouri.

[30:34] heard the message and they've been
[30:35] streaming. They want to come and visit
[30:36] us. So it's good to have you. God bless
[30:38] you and you're very welcome. And any
[30:40] other visitors, if you're here, we just
[30:42] want you to feel very welcome at home.
[30:44] And we thank God for the opportunity to
[30:45] worship together. Amen. It's a precious
[30:48] privilege for all of us. Amen. And while
[30:51] we're standing, if you could turn your
[30:52] Bibles to Genesis chapter 1. This is the
[30:55] scripture we've been opening with for
[30:57] the last uh this will be the fifth
[30:59] service as we take the same topic, a
[31:02] message from the Holy Spirit from the
[31:04] pick up your pen and write portion of
[31:06] the message. And so we're going to start
[31:07] here at the same scripture, Genesis
[31:10] 1 verse 11. Genesis 1 11.
[31:17] And God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[31:19] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[31:21] fruit tree yielding fruit after its
[31:24] kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
[31:26] earth." And it was so. And the earth
[31:28] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[31:30] seed after its kind. And the tree
[31:32] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[31:34] after his kind. And God saw that it was
[31:37] good. And the evening and the morning
[31:39] were the third day. May God bless you as
[31:42] you're seated. Uh, I keep repeating
[31:45] myself, but and I do it intentionally,
[31:48] but it it's just so good to keep this
[31:50] message in context as brother Bam's
[31:53] coming to spoken word is the original
[31:54] seed. This is his opening scripture
[31:56] because he's going to show us the
[31:57] principle that the spoken word is the
[32:00] original seed
[32:01] &gt;&gt; and it's it's quite a principle in the
[32:03] scripture. So, we're going to look at
[32:04] that just for a minute as we move on. I
[32:06] I have intentions of finishing this uh
[32:09] to the end today and and I say the word
[32:12] intentions.
[32:15] So some of it Hey, listen. Some of it
[32:17] depends on you,
[32:19] &gt;&gt; you know. So don't I can't be blamed for
[32:21] all of it. Amen. We share in this
[32:23] together, but if you'll just keep
[32:25] pulling and we just want God to have his
[32:26] way and tell us what he wants to tell
[32:28] us. Amen. We're going through, we're not
[32:30] breaking down every word. We're not
[32:31] playing out everything, but as we feel
[32:32] inspired to highlight something, to draw
[32:34] on it, we're just going that way, going
[32:36] through it slowly. And I've been
[32:37] thoroughly enjoying it myself has been
[32:40] something that's been very special for
[32:41] me. Uh, and I hope it is for you as
[32:44] well. But let's just let's just work
[32:46] together. Amen. To rightly divide the
[32:48] word of God. It takes teamwork here. You
[32:50] pull, I'll surrender, and we'll let God
[32:53] speak. Amen. Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Um, as we take a look at this, uh, quote
[32:58] now, he says, "Remember, every spoken
[33:00] word of God is the original seed." So,
[33:03] the original seed is when God's thought,
[33:07] amen, becomes word. When he expresses
[33:09] his thought, now that's the original
[33:11] seed. And that thought has to fully
[33:14] materialize. Amen. And, and if it's not
[33:17] hybrid, it will always stay with the
[33:19] original thought. Amen. So now remember,
[33:22] every spoken word of God is the original
[33:23] seed. God planted everything in the
[33:25] earth by his word. And as long as you
[33:27] stay with the original seed, it will
[33:29] breed itself right back and reproduce
[33:31] itself again. Hybrid it, it dies. So
[33:34] brother Bam is laying this principle
[33:36] down and spoken words, the original seed
[33:37] to try to show us we've got to come back
[33:39] to the original word of God. And the
[33:41] original word of God will always produce
[33:43] the same thing. Amen. It'll always
[33:46] produce the life of God because the word
[33:48] is God. It's his thought expressed. So
[33:51] it every word, Amen, is a thought
[33:55] expressed. And that's why brother Bram
[33:57] said, "And the word is God."
[33:59] Because God, God is the collection of
[34:01] his thoughts he had about himself. God
[34:03] is his thoughts. Amen. What he thought,
[34:05] what he's thinking on. Amen. Before uh
[34:08] he had form that we understand, he was
[34:10] the invisible God before space and time
[34:12] and matter. Before all of that, he was
[34:14] he was brother V. He was alone with his
[34:16] thoughts. He was the consummation of his
[34:18] thoughts. He was the collection of his
[34:19] thoughts. And now whenever those
[34:21] thoughts become a word, that's him.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the word and the word is
[34:26] him. Amen. And God has been trying to
[34:29] express what's been in his mind and he's
[34:31] expressed through word and the word
[34:33] comes into manifestation and it's
[34:34] expressing God.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can't hybrid it.
[34:39] Because if you hybrid it, then it begins
[34:41] to die. It's got to stay original to
[34:43] that thought that he had. That's why I
[34:45] thank God that the spoken word is the
[34:46] original seed and God through a pro
[34:48] prophetic ministry has brought back the
[34:50] original word so that we can have life.
[34:52] Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; He says here again, all of God's sons
[34:57] must be the same. Yes, sir. To be born
[34:59] of the word and spirit brings us back to
[35:02] the spoken word again like in John 3.
[35:05] See, to be born of the water and the
[35:08] spirit, what does it do? Then it brings
[35:10] you right back again to the place of
[35:12] where you should have been at the
[35:14] beginning. He's talking about the fall
[35:15] in the Garden of Eden because God's
[35:17] original intention was for him to bring
[35:20] forth himself in a family attributes in
[35:23] flesh upon the earth fellowshipping
[35:25] together on his creation. That was his
[35:27] original thought. That was his original
[35:29] plan. That's what he wanted to
[35:31] accomplish. And sin disrupted that. And
[35:33] there was a a perversion, a hybriding,
[35:35] and began to bring death. But the cycle
[35:37] of redemption is to redeem back to that
[35:39] thought.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Back to that purpose. And that's what
[35:42] God's been doing through the entire
[35:44] Bible. That's why the whole Bible is a
[35:46] book of redemption. It's a story. God
[35:48] shows you the masterpiece from the
[35:50] beginning. This is the masterpiece of
[35:51] the thought of the artist. What he
[35:53] envisioned in his mind. What he wanted
[35:54] to reproduce and he reproduced it and he
[35:57] placed it in the Garden of Eden. And
[35:58] then an enemy came in and marred the
[36:00] masterpiece and it fell over. But he
[36:02] didn't leave it there in ruin. He
[36:04] started working again. It took 6,000
[36:06] years to get to the masterpiece. Now
[36:08] he's been working 6,000 years to bring
[36:10] back his original thought, his original
[36:12] word with the original intention is to
[36:15] what? To God to reproduce himself as a
[36:18] family in flesh upon this earth.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why we had to be restored to
[36:25] the word to come back to that purpose.
[36:27] Amen. Amen.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; If we would have been born in the
[36:30] beginning correctly, we would have been
[36:32] an attribute of God now expressed upon
[36:34] the earth. God expressing himself as his
[36:36] family in perfection. Amen. But it was
[36:40] marred. But now to be born of the water
[36:42] and the spirit, what does it do then? It
[36:45] brings you right back again into the
[36:47] place where you should have been at the
[36:48] beginning. Amen. It brings you, what's
[36:50] he say? See, that's the reason of
[36:52] Christ's death. It brings us right back
[36:54] again to where? Sons of God. What what
[36:57] does he want us to be? Sons of God. What
[36:59] would we have been been if we would have
[37:01] been born correctly? Sons of God. What
[37:03] happens now through the spiritual new
[37:05] birth? That's why we must be born again
[37:07] because we were born wrong in the flesh.
[37:09] We have to be born again. And born again
[37:10] to what? Back to sons of God. Amen.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; If Eve would have brought forth that
[37:17] child, she would have finally done it.
[37:19] Did not God tell her multiply and
[37:21] replenish the earth? He says, "What
[37:24] happened? Eve hybrid it bred it what it
[37:26] did then what did it do turn to death
[37:29] just keep dying dying now this one come
[37:31] and that out now here stays the word
[37:34] just the same here's the word laying
[37:36] here just the same now what happened
[37:39] here is the word now the word that God
[37:41] spoke to multiply and replenish the
[37:43] earth it couldn't find a place to land
[37:46] finally this word caught into the womb
[37:48] of a virgin
[37:50] &gt;&gt; oh this is so good friends he's he's
[37:52] want what does he wanted to bring forth
[37:54] son. Adam was a son of God and he was
[37:56] supposed to reproduce himself to
[37:58] reproduce another son of God. Amen. A
[38:00] Christ upon the earth. Amen. But that
[38:03] got marred. And so God said, "Multiply
[38:05] and replenish." And now they went about
[38:06] it the wrong way by reasoning and
[38:08] hybrid. And now it could no longer
[38:10] reproduce the original thought and the
[38:12] original form. So that word, Mother Beam
[38:15] said, that word that God spoke, it's got
[38:18] to find a resting place cuz that word
[38:20] can't die. Amen. So that resting place
[38:22] was in the womb of a virgin. And now in
[38:25] the womb of the virgin, that prophecy,
[38:27] that word, that spoken word of God,
[38:28] that's the original seed. Amen. Took
[38:31] root in that womb and reproduced what?
[38:33] The word.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; What's the word? The thought of God
[38:38] expressed. What was his thought? Amen.
[38:40] To become flesh upon the earth. And he
[38:42] did that in Jesus Christ. That's why
[38:44] brother Benham said, "When I see when I
[38:46] see this, I see denominations and all
[38:48] things just fading away and everything
[38:50] fades away. There's only that one thing
[38:52] and that's Jesus Christ. He's the only
[38:54] thing. What is Jesus Christ? He is the
[38:56] fullness of God. His full thought and
[38:58] desire now manifest upon the earth. And
[39:01] what is that? It's God wants to be flesh
[39:05] upon the earth to fellowship with his
[39:07] children.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; That's why everything fades away and
[39:10] everything wraps up in that one person,
[39:12] Jesus Christ, which is amen. The spoken
[39:16] word materialized, the thought of God
[39:18] made manifest. God reproduced upon the
[39:21] earth.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[39:24] &gt;&gt; amen. And and Adam was supposed to do
[39:27] that, but it failed. But that word can't
[39:30] fail. It can never stop. It's got to
[39:32] keep circling the earth, waiting to come
[39:34] to manifestation. And it came to
[39:36] manifestation in perfect time when that
[39:38] word dropped into the womb of a virgin.
[39:41] And now because of his death, burial,
[39:44] and resurrection, and the shedding of
[39:45] his blood, and the price of redemption,
[39:47] his spirit is available to bring us
[39:49] spiritual new birth. Amen. Now, we don't
[39:52] have to to succumb to the hybrid
[39:55] condition anymore. But he's providing
[39:57] his own spirit to give us power to
[39:59] manifest his word in every day and age
[40:02] that we're living in by the spirit that
[40:04] he poured out. Because that spirit could
[40:06] come upon man, that spirit could anoint
[40:08] man. But until he had a sanctifying
[40:10] power of his blood to separate us from
[40:12] sin, that spirit could not live in man.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; But now he's brought back the spoken
[40:19] word
[40:20] &gt;&gt; to bring back sons and daughters of God,
[40:22] moving us all the way back in redemption
[40:24] to the place where we come back to a
[40:27] perfect body. No more hybridization to a
[40:29] restored earth.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad for this message.
[40:35] He says when God give a commission which
[40:38] cannot perish. He's talking about
[40:40] multiply and replenish. When God give a
[40:43] commission which cannot perish. God's
[40:45] word is eternal. It cannot fail. When he
[40:47] said multiply and replenish earth, that
[40:49] was God's eternal purpose to carry that
[40:51] out. You cannot die
[40:54] &gt;&gt; because the original word is life. Amen.
[40:56] But when you hybrid it, it brings death
[40:58] because it's his word. You have to live.
[41:00] If that child had been brought forth,
[41:02] right, there would have been no death.
[41:04] But she couldn't wait.
[41:07] So the whole lesson for us is to stay
[41:11] with the original word
[41:13] &gt;&gt; to wait and let him produce. Don't
[41:15] hybrid. Don't add reasoning. Don't
[41:17] change anything. This what brother's
[41:18] trying to show us that he's brought back
[41:20] the word, the original, the foundation
[41:23] of the church back to the teaching of
[41:24] the apostles and prophets, back to
[41:26] hearts turned back to the uh uh to the
[41:29] fathers, the apostolic fathers. And he's
[41:32] telling us to stay with this word
[41:34] because this word cannot bring death. It
[41:37] can only bring life. But if you
[41:38] hybridize it, which is what
[41:40] denominationalism did, he said it will
[41:42] only bring death and can't reproduce
[41:44] itself again.
[41:46] So that word, that commission has to
[41:50] find a resting place to reproduce the
[41:53] sons and daughters of God on earth
[41:55] again. And I want my soul to be that
[41:57] resting place. Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, thanks be to God Almighty. If you
[42:03] take your little booklet that we've been
[42:05] looking through, if you didn't get a
[42:07] booklet, there's some by the back door.
[42:08] The deacons have them. There's some in
[42:10] the forer as well. You can run and grab
[42:12] one or wave your hand. They'll bring it
[42:14] to you or whatever. We'll we'll we'll
[42:17] serve you.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; We'll bring it to you. But let's go to
[42:20] the page one
[42:23] and read right from the beginning here.
[42:27] says, "One night as I was seeking the
[42:30] Lord, the Holy Spirit told me to pick up
[42:32] my pen and write. As I grasped the pen
[42:35] to write, his spirit gave me a message
[42:37] for the church. I want to bring it to
[42:39] you. It has to do with the word and the
[42:40] bride."
[42:42] Here is what I'm trying to say to you.
[42:44] The law of reproduction is that each
[42:46] species brings forth after its own kind,
[42:49] even according to Genesis 1:11.
[42:52] It's such a simple thought, but the
[42:55] original word will bring forth the word.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; We come back to the original doctrine,
[43:02] the original teaching, the original
[43:04] thought of God, the original word, it'll
[43:06] reproduce the word. It can't produce
[43:08] anything else. But if you hybrid that
[43:10] word and keep sewing a hybrid seed, it
[43:12] will only reproduce what it is, is a
[43:14] hybrid seed. It can never come back to
[43:17] pure life. And so the by God's grace,
[43:19] he's brought us back to the original
[43:21] word. And that original word, Amen, will
[43:24] only bring forth after its kind. So what
[43:28] do I what what do I want to do? I want
[43:30] to stay with nothing but the original
[43:32] word that was delivered through a
[43:33] prophetic office in the end time, the
[43:35] restoration of truth. That's all I want
[43:37] because that's what produces life.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get smarter. I don't
[43:41] want to figure it out. I don't want to
[43:42] sort it. I just want to receive it. I
[43:44] want to believe it. I want to manifest.
[43:46] I want to surrender to it and I want him
[43:48] to do what he promised he would do with
[43:49] that original word in me.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now let's jump from here over
[43:55] to where we are now on page seven.
[43:59] We'll go from where we've been studying
[44:01] and continue on.
[44:07] And there's several points we're going
[44:08] to get and highlight several different
[44:10] things. So, it's not going to be all one
[44:12] subject, but we'll just go uh as as we
[44:15] can.
[44:17] Um,
[44:20] let me
[44:22] jump over here. Okay, we'll get to this
[44:25] in a second, but let's read at the
[44:27] bottom of page 7, paragraph 175-1.
[44:32] The strange behavior of Moses, Elijah,
[44:34] and John withdrawing from the people
[44:36] into seclusion left many confused. They
[44:39] did not realize that it was because
[44:41] their message had been rejected. But the
[44:43] seed had been swn. The planting was
[44:45] over. Judgment was next. They had served
[44:47] their purpose as a sign to the people.
[44:50] So judgment was next. Now let's go to
[44:53] the top of page 8. He says, "I believe
[44:56] according to Revelation 13:16 that the
[44:58] bride will have to stop preaching for
[45:01] the beast is demanding the mark in the
[45:03] hand or the forehead if permission to
[45:05] preach be granted. denominations will
[45:08] take the mark or be forced to quit
[45:09] preaching. Then the lamb will come for
[45:12] his bride and judge the great harlot. So
[45:15] I want to go, let's turn together to
[45:16] Revelation 13. And I want to give some
[45:18] background to this because this is just
[45:21] a quick statement that says that I
[45:24] believe
[45:25] that the bride will uh have to stop
[45:29] preaching because of the beast. So I
[45:32] want to look at this again and
[45:33] understand the context of this and where
[45:35] this is coming from. So let's look at
[45:37] Revelations 13 verse 1.
[45:42] And I stood upon the sand of the sea and
[45:44] saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[45:46] having seven heads and 10 horns and upon
[45:49] his horns upon his horns 10 crowns and
[45:52] upon his heads the name name of
[45:54] blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was
[45:57] like unto a leopard, and his feet were
[45:59] as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as
[46:01] the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave
[46:04] him his power, and his seat, and great
[46:06] authority. Amen. Brother teaches us all
[46:08] these things and break it down. We're
[46:10] not going to go in great detail today,
[46:11] but he shows us that this is the old
[46:14] Babylonian system that is a that is the
[46:16] gentile world powers now all rolled up
[46:19] into Romanism and and has moved from
[46:22] pagan Rome to papal Rome and become a
[46:24] church with political and spiritual
[46:26] influence united together. And he's
[46:28] showing us the dragon which is Satan
[46:29] himself has given an anointing and a
[46:31] seat to this beast. This this beast is a
[46:34] power and it's a power of politics
[46:36] united with religion.
[46:39] And and so he's showing the compilation
[46:41] of the animals is these uh is these uh
[46:44] four gentile world powers starting from
[46:46] Babylon to the Mes and the Persians to
[46:48] the Greeks and finally to the Rome and
[46:50] Rome and the feet of the image. Remember
[46:51] the image of Daniel. It went out into
[46:53] the toes. That was the end. That was the
[46:56] last world power, the gentile world
[46:57] power that would dominate the world
[46:59] until the stone was cut out of the
[47:00] mountain without hands and struck in the
[47:02] feet and destroyed the whole system.
[47:04] Right? So now they're showing us that
[47:06] this beast is a compilation of all of it
[47:08] before. The leopard, the bear, the lion,
[47:10] all rolled into one because what was
[47:12] Babylon moved into meat in Persia, moved
[47:14] into Greece, moved into Rome, and all of
[47:16] it collected together in the Roman
[47:18] Catholic Church.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now and I saw one of his
[47:22] heads as it were wounded to death, and
[47:24] his deadly wound was healed, and all the
[47:27] world wondered after the beast." This is
[47:29] when Rome was falling. It was
[47:30] collapsing. It was it was doomed. Amen.
[47:33] But the cath the Catholic Church had
[47:35] risen to power and now and risen to
[47:37] power and wealth. And when pagan Rome
[47:39] was falling, Amen. the the pope bought
[47:42] out the enemy who was coming to attack
[47:44] them and brought peace and saved Rome.
[47:46] And by doing so, they became the power
[47:48] over Rome. And that whole system moved
[47:51] into the Catholic Church. And that's why
[47:53] it went from the Roman Empire to the
[47:55] Holy Roman Empire because now it was a
[47:58] church in politics united and the king
[48:00] or emperor of the whole empire was the
[48:02] pope.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; So that this is all history. This is all
[48:06] world history. And it's showing all of
[48:08] this that deadly wound was healed.
[48:12] And they worshiped the dragon and gave
[48:14] power unto the beast. And they worshiped
[48:15] the beast saying, "Who is like unto the
[48:17] beast who is able to make war with him?"
[48:19] And there was given unto him a mouth
[48:21] speaking great things and blasphemies
[48:23] and power was given unto him to continue
[48:25] 40 and two months. That's three and a
[48:27] half years. That'll be the tribulation
[48:29] period. And he opened his mouth and
[48:31] blasphemy against God to blasphe his
[48:33] name and his tabernacle and them that
[48:35] dwell in heaven. And it was given unto
[48:38] him to make war with the saints and to
[48:39] overcome them. And power was given him
[48:41] over all kindreds and tongues and
[48:44] nations. and all that dwell upon the
[48:46] earth shall worship him whose names are
[48:49] not written in the book of life of the
[48:50] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[48:53] world. So that is the that is the the
[48:56] beast system. That's the original uh uh
[48:59] uh beast system there. The gentile world
[49:01] powers blended into a religious power
[49:04] and and unified.
[49:06] But now we're going to get to another
[49:08] beast. So I want to look at these beasts
[49:10] in the book of uh uh Revelation 13. Now
[49:13] let's go to verse 11.
[49:15] And I beheld another beast coming up out
[49:18] of the earth. And he had two horns like
[49:21] a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he
[49:23] exercised all the power of the first
[49:25] beast before him, and causes the earth,
[49:27] and them which dwell therein to worship
[49:29] the first beast, whose deadly wound was
[49:31] healed. And he does great wonders, so
[49:34] that he maketh fire come down from
[49:35] heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
[49:38] and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[49:40] earth by the means of these miracles,
[49:42] which he had power to do in the sight of
[49:44] the beast, saying to them that dwell on
[49:46] the earth, that they should make an
[49:47] image to the beast, which had the wound
[49:49] by the sword, and did live. And he gave
[49:52] power and he had power to give life unto
[49:54] the image of the beast that the image of
[49:56] the beast should both speak and cause
[49:58] that as many as would not worship the
[50:00] image of the beast should be killed. So
[50:03] brother Ram comes now he's explaining
[50:05] all of this and he comes to this portion
[50:07] of scripture and if I could I'll take a
[50:09] quote here out of the mark of the beast.
[50:12] He says uh and this is from 1954 said I
[50:17] beheld another beast coming up out of
[50:18] the earth not out of water because that
[50:21] first beast rose up out of the populated
[50:23] part of the earth but this beast is
[50:25] America and it's coming out of the land
[50:26] where very few people were say it's
[50:29] coming out of the earth then the
[50:30] thickness and multitudes of people is
[50:32] water then this is where there was no
[50:34] people the United States and he had two
[50:37] horns like a lamb remember Bible says
[50:39] like a lamb and brother says two horns
[50:41] like a lamb not a lamb What is it? It's
[50:43] our American buffalo.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Which which President Obama designated
[50:49] as a national symbol now
[50:51] &gt;&gt; just a few years ago. The buffalo. Amen.
[50:54] And so uh see sure there he is two horns
[50:57] like a lamb. But then what did he do? He
[51:00] had freedom of religion. First he acted
[51:02] like a lamb. He spoke like a lamb. But
[51:05] remember he never did become an old ram.
[51:07] He was a lamb. The country is only 150
[51:10] years old. You know just a lamb. And
[51:11] then he spake like a dragon, and he
[51:13] exercised all the power the first beast
[51:15] had before him, the red dragon, and
[51:17] caused all that was on the earth that
[51:19] dwelleth upon the earth, to worship the
[51:21] beast whose deadly wound was healed.
[51:23] Look, and he does great wonders so to
[51:26] make him a fire come down out of heaven.
[51:29] Brother says, the atomic bomb and
[51:31] hydrogen, smart, intelligent nation and
[51:34] so forth, deceiving the nations by these
[51:36] things.
[51:38] This is important because uh that that
[51:41] Roman system began to diminish in its
[51:43] political power but it never diminishes
[51:46] a religion. It was always working behind
[51:48] the scenes. Now America comes up as
[51:50] freedom of a religion trying to get away
[51:52] from the control of organized religion.
[51:54] Amen. But we saw through the things that
[51:56] we've been studying through the election
[51:58] of a of a Catholic uh h a Catholic
[52:01] president how that Catholic system
[52:03] wormed its way back in. Brother said
[52:05] wait till it gets wormed in the cabinet
[52:06] and all of that. And it's here, friends.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And the members of Congress, the the the
[52:12] the majority of the members of the uh uh
[52:14] US Supreme Court, all Catholic,
[52:16] Catholic, Catholic, our vice president,
[52:18] Catholic. It's a it's it's all wormed
[52:20] its way into the government. It's done
[52:21] exactly what he said done. And it
[52:23] started off like a lamb and innocence
[52:25] and spoke like a dragon said like a
[52:27] lamb. But it was just a an American
[52:29] buffalo. That's the image that Brother
[52:30] Bam tied it to. Amen. But then it had
[52:33] freedom of religion, but he said that
[52:34] thing had two horns. One was
[52:36] ecclesiastical and one was political.
[52:38] And and it's starting to unite the two.
[52:41] And we're watching it happen in politics
[52:43] right now. Anding uniting the religion
[52:45] and the political world together, which
[52:47] is exactly what the first beast did.
[52:49] Tied politics and religion together to
[52:52] rule.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what America is doing. And
[52:55] brother Bam said, doing it through the
[52:56] World Council of Churches, trying to
[52:58] bring a system that unites everybody and
[53:00] brings it together. And it'll eventually
[53:02] be headed up by the pope. Though they
[53:03] never intended it to be that way. That's
[53:05] what the prophet told us. And what power
[53:07] is bringing this to pass? It's this new
[53:10] beast that's come up out of the earth.
[53:11] It's America. And America rose to
[53:14] prominence in World War II. Amen. And
[53:16] America did miracles inside of all the
[53:18] people and deceive the nation. And what
[53:20] was the miracles? They brought fire down
[53:22] from heaven upon the earth in the sight
[53:24] of all men.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; That was the miracle. And brother Bam
[53:28] said, "That's the atomic bomb,
[53:29] hydrogen."
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And so I started looking at that because
[53:33] it's so interesting. It ties in, listen,
[53:35] it ties in with the bride not being able
[53:37] to preach because they're going to move
[53:39] into this political religious
[53:41] unification. Amen. And if you don't
[53:43] unify with it, if you don't come into
[53:45] terms with it, like we won't come into
[53:48] terms with any system, amen, anything
[53:50] that degrades the word of God one iota
[53:52] and forces us, amen, to let down the bar
[53:54] on one word, we won't be able to be part
[53:56] of that system because how can two walk
[53:58] together unless they be agreed? But
[54:00] immediately you're going to be shut on
[54:02] the outside and you won't be able to
[54:03] preach. And brother Bam said, "Amen.
[54:04] They'll lock the doors to the church."
[54:06] And he has so many things that he says
[54:08] about that.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; But I started looking at this America
[54:11] and her place and her role in prophecy.
[54:14] And now in World War II and and uh once
[54:18] again about two years ago, I think it
[54:21] was, I was at the Air Force Museum. I
[54:24] mean, there's revelations all over the
[54:26] Air Force Museum. Friends,
[54:27] &gt;&gt; you should go.
[54:30] In fact, every museum I go to, all I can
[54:32] see is the message.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Almost all the modern world events that
[54:37] have major significance, two world wars,
[54:39] um the the the the mass production of
[54:41] the automobile, the plane, the
[54:43] spacecraft, launching a man into orbit,
[54:45] it all happened in the lifetime of a
[54:46] prophet so he could preach the message
[54:48] countdown and show us that we've went
[54:50] from horse and buggy to automobile. And
[54:52] in his lifetime, he remembers the horse
[54:54] and buggy, the automobile, the plane,
[54:56] and then the spaceship launching a man
[54:57] breaking gravitational hold and bringing
[54:59] him outside the hold of the world. Amen.
[55:01] All of that happened in the lifetime of
[55:03] one human being in 56 years. Look at how
[55:06] remarkable that is.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; So every museum to me is the message.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; I don't just go in there and say, "Well,
[55:14] this happened, this is what the prophet
[55:16] talked about. This is what he said. This
[55:17] is prophecy. This is this is Revelation
[55:20] 13.
[55:21] So it becomes so much fun.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And so I was at the Air Force Museum and
[55:29] they've got an airplane. I think it's a
[55:31] B29 bomber. I may get the numbers wrong.
[55:33] Forgive me for you aircraft fanatics.
[55:39] I get the nomenclature all twisted. But
[55:40] a big bomber. It's called Boxcar. Boxcar
[55:44] is the plane that dropped the second
[55:45] atomic bomb dropped on a Nagasaki. There
[55:48] was another plane that dropped the first
[55:50] one on Hiroshima.
[55:52] And the dropping of those two bombs are
[55:54] what ended the war. And it was the first
[55:56] time nuclear weapons were used in
[55:58] warfare. But I'll put a disclaimer, the
[56:00] first time in modern history.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Brandham said it was an
[56:05] atomic bomb that knocked the earth off
[56:06] its asses and caused the flood in the
[56:08] beginning.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; There was an atomic power way back
[56:10] there.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; So they say the first time ever. I say
[56:13] the first time in modern history.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. first time that they know of.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Y
[56:19] &gt;&gt; So, so I looked at this. Let's look at
[56:22] this scripture together.
[56:25] Verse 13.
[56:28] Brother Bam said, uh, America is the
[56:30] number 13. It started with 13 colonies,
[56:34] 13 states, 13 stripes. The number 13. It
[56:37] shows up in Revelation chapter 13. Now
[56:39] look at chapter 13:13.
[56:43] and he does great wonders so that he
[56:45] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[56:47] earth in the sight of men.
[56:50] This is what astonished me when I was in
[56:52] that uh museum
[56:54] is
[56:56] that I was reading on the bomb and
[56:58] reading on the bombings
[57:00] and I had always just assumed I don't
[57:03] know where I got the assumption but it
[57:05] was through ignorance but assumed that
[57:07] the atomic bomb fell out of the plane
[57:10] and came all the way to the ground and
[57:12] when it struck the ground it detonated
[57:13] and exploded. But while I'm standing
[57:16] there looking in that plaque, all of a
[57:18] sudden it said that that bomb fell for
[57:21] 40ome seconds and when it got to
[57:24] approximately 2,000 ft off the ground,
[57:27] it detonated and exploded.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; What that was so significant for me is
[57:33] he will cause fire to fall down from
[57:35] heaven
[57:37] &gt;&gt; to the earth. And that is exactly what
[57:40] that atomic bomb did when America
[57:42] dropped it. They they caused literally
[57:45] they caused fire to fall from the heaven
[57:47] 2,000 ft in the air. It detonated,
[57:49] exploded. It created the heat, the same
[57:51] heat 1,800,000 degree Fahrenheit that
[57:54] you find in the core of the sun. Man
[57:56] made his own miniature sun.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Think about this. Man is always trying
[58:00] to do what God's doing because God made
[58:02] the sun through nuclear fusion. And they
[58:04] made through nuclear fusion another sun.
[58:06] Amen. And it was blinding light.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; You mean man uses a blinding light to
[58:12] destroy? Absolutely. It starts with a
[58:14] blinding light with the intensity of the
[58:16] sun and then the heat rays, the fire
[58:19] falls down from there upon the earth.
[58:20] When those heat rays hit the earth in
[58:23] the epicenter, the core where it fell,
[58:24] it was 7,232
[58:27] degrees.
[58:29] This this beast out of the earth
[58:31] literally made fire come down from
[58:34] heaven upon the earth exactly the way
[58:36] the Bible said it would.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; And we had a prophet in our day to say
[58:40] this is that.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when you go to learn more
[58:43] about that, the more you learn about
[58:44] that, the more you realize this is that
[58:47] &gt;&gt; and that is this. And the prophet was
[58:49] exactly right and knew exactly what he
[58:50] was looking at and it matched the Bible
[58:52] word for word and perfection.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And because he did that in the sight of
[58:56] all, he deceived the whole world. This
[58:58] is when America rose to prominence and
[59:01] world power. Before that, they were not.
[59:03] the European nations were. But America
[59:05] rose to power because of their influence
[59:07] in World War II and because they they
[59:10] were able to have such technology,
[59:12] technological advances and defeat the
[59:13] enemy. And they ended the war with the
[59:15] with nuclear bombs.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; And it immediately catapulted America to
[59:20] the world power, to the supreme world
[59:22] power. It even changed the money system.
[59:24] Now, now gold the the the standard was
[59:28] going to be the US dollar. Everything
[59:29] changed. The whole system now revolved
[59:31] around the United States because of the
[59:33] miracles they could do in the sight of
[59:35] all men.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Exactly what God said thousands of years
[59:40] before.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God. We have a sure word of
[59:44] prophecy.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; So, I remembered reading that when I got
[59:48] to this part, I started uh I just say
[59:51] that's not all, friends.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; So, I just look at it because these
[59:56] things fascinate me.
[59:58] You know how brother Bam said, "God
[1:00:00] makes man testify."
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He makes man testify of it.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; The the serpent on the pole and every
[1:00:06] ambulance, he makes him testify of
[1:00:09] divine healing.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; So, I started researching this to make
[1:00:13] sure I had my figures right, that it was
[1:00:15] in the air and fire come down and all
[1:00:16] the things that happened.
[1:00:19] And while I was uh I was watching a
[1:00:21] science clip on that and and they
[1:00:24] started talking about when they were
[1:00:25] developing the bomb and there was a
[1:00:28] scientist a nuclear physicist by the
[1:00:30] name of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Iimer
[1:00:33] was the head of the program to develop
[1:00:34] the nuclear bomb and they wanted to
[1:00:37] detonate one to see if it would work.
[1:00:39] They were building it. They had the
[1:00:40] concept, but many scientists were afraid
[1:00:43] to detonate a nuclear bomb because they
[1:00:45] were afraid that it would start a chain
[1:00:47] reaction in the atmosphere and explode
[1:00:48] the entire atmosphere.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God, that's going to happen
[1:00:52] someday.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; They're not far from the truth.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; They were afraid. And so they kept doing
[1:01:00] calculations and they finally the the
[1:01:02] way the science video said, they said
[1:01:04] they found by calculations it was highly
[1:01:07] unlikely that would happen.
[1:01:11] To me, that's not 100%. You know, that's
[1:01:13] highly unlikely. And they decided to go
[1:01:15] ahead and try it. Can you imagine? I
[1:01:19] There's about a 95% chance that won't
[1:01:21] happen. We won't destroy the entire
[1:01:23] planet and kill everybody on it. You
[1:01:24] want to go for it? Yeah. 95% is pretty
[1:01:27] good,
[1:01:28] man. Is ridiculous, friends. So,
[1:01:31] anyways, they decide to go ahead with
[1:01:33] it. So, they're going to they're going
[1:01:35] to have this secret. They have a secret
[1:01:36] test. They're going to they're going to
[1:01:38] uh detonate a nuclear bomb, an atomic
[1:01:41] bomb for the first time. I think it was
[1:01:42] a plutonium bomb.
[1:01:45] And so Oenheimimer
[1:01:47] names came this explosion, this test,
[1:01:50] because they had code names for
[1:01:51] everything.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know what the code name for this
[1:01:57] first time man in modern history is
[1:02:00] going to explode a nuclear bomb?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Trinity.
[1:02:05] He cames it Trinity.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; It was the Trinity test. And you can
[1:02:11] still go to New Mexico. There's two
[1:02:13] times a year that you can get on the
[1:02:14] site where they detonated in April and
[1:02:16] October. And it's called the Trinity
[1:02:18] site.
[1:02:20] And it was the Trinity test. And it's
[1:02:21] code name Trinity. And man was now going
[1:02:25] to unleash the most powerful destructive
[1:02:28] force that man has come up with in
[1:02:30] modern times. The most destructive force
[1:02:32] that he can come up with with modern
[1:02:34] science, with his reasoning, with his
[1:02:36] intelligence, with his science. The most
[1:02:37] destructive thing was this nuclear bomb.
[1:02:39] And he named it Trinity because Trinity
[1:02:41] was the most destructive doctrine that
[1:02:43] man came up with with his reasoning.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; God makes them testify of it. And then
[1:02:49] that Trinity doctrine becomes the litmus
[1:02:51] test whether you're a Christian or not.
[1:02:52] Because if you want to re believe the
[1:02:54] true doctrine of the Godhead, now you're
[1:02:56] not a Christian. You believe something
[1:02:57] false because it's widely accepted. We
[1:02:59] all believe Trinity. What do you think
[1:03:01] is going to be one of the bases for this
[1:03:02] world system? Listen, if you're a
[1:03:04] Christian church, these are the
[1:03:05] fundamental beliefs. But I don't believe
[1:03:07] in a in a trinity. I believe in a
[1:03:09] trinity of offices, not a trinity of
[1:03:11] persons. I believe in one God and the
[1:03:12] Godhead. And that God desired to be a
[1:03:14] family. And what's so insidious and
[1:03:16] destructive about the trinity doctrine
[1:03:18] is it changes the very nature of God.
[1:03:20] And you change the very nature of God,
[1:03:22] you change the very plan of God. Because
[1:03:24] God's plan was for one God, one Godhead
[1:03:26] to become a family. And if you split him
[1:03:29] up into three people and you lock it in
[1:03:30] there, then you've cut me out of the
[1:03:32] program and you've cut you out of the
[1:03:34] program and all the sons of God are cut
[1:03:36] out of the program. And that's an
[1:03:37] insidious, destructive force that has
[1:03:40] hit the spiritual world.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; My goodness, if God is not perfect,
[1:03:47] friends,
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; this message is perfect. And brother Bam
[1:03:50] knew exactly what he was talking about
[1:03:52] and he points to that. And the deeper
[1:03:54] you go, the more astounding it gets and
[1:03:56] the more amazing it gets. And what what
[1:03:58] possessed that man oppenheimer? Amen. To
[1:04:01] call to call that test trinity.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; My God's forcing him to declare with his
[1:04:07] own mouth
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; the destructive force of man spiritually
[1:04:10] and naturally.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And this is what brought America to
[1:04:14] prominence. And American prominence is
[1:04:16] going to tie the whole world back to the
[1:04:18] original worship of the B system, the
[1:04:20] Roman system. bringing back the Roman
[1:04:22] system with a unification of religion
[1:04:25] and politics.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And then they become the world policing
[1:04:29] force and the great power of the world
[1:04:31] so that they can force anybody who will
[1:04:33] not go along with this will now suffer
[1:04:35] the consequences and the wrath of the
[1:04:37] great powerful
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; beast that was like a lamb.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; My friends,
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; don't you love serving God?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he knew all of this from all
[1:04:50] the way back and he let everything
[1:04:52] happen according to his perfect plan and
[1:04:54] it had to happen while a prophet was
[1:04:55] here and a prophet had to declare it and
[1:04:57] see it and all of these things have to
[1:04:58] testify themselves. Amen. What am I
[1:05:01] worried about in my dayto-day life? He's
[1:05:02] watched over everything and everything's
[1:05:04] perfect and it'll all work out perfect
[1:05:06] and he's allowed everything to come to
[1:05:08] the way it's coming. And if if the bride
[1:05:11] is forced to stop preaching, then praise
[1:05:13] God, it's already prophesied. Then God
[1:05:15] will allow all circumstance to come
[1:05:17] together to bring that result because
[1:05:19] that's prophecy.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; They have give a boycott. They have to
[1:05:25] buy or sell. Let's let's continue
[1:05:26] reading. Let's look here at verse 16.
[1:05:31] And he causes all both small and great,
[1:05:33] rich and poor, free and bond to receive
[1:05:35] a mark in their right hand or in their
[1:05:37] foreheads. and that no man might by or
[1:05:40] sell save he that hath the mark or the
[1:05:42] name of the beast or the number of his
[1:05:44] name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath
[1:05:46] understanding count the number of the
[1:05:48] beast for it is the number of a man and
[1:05:50] his number 6003 score and six. Amen. And
[1:05:53] brother Bam takes that number and
[1:05:54] attaches it to the Roman numerals that's
[1:05:56] in the title of the pope vicarious fili
[1:05:58] day. Amen. And he becomes a vicer of
[1:06:02] Christ in the place of Christ sitting in
[1:06:03] the seat of God. all the prophecies that
[1:06:05] say that at some point Satan will be
[1:06:08] incarnate in this man and he'll become
[1:06:09] the beast.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; All these things will happen. Brother's
[1:06:14] telling us right here and pick up your
[1:06:16] pen and write anointed of the spirit. I
[1:06:18] believe according to Revelation 13:16
[1:06:20] that the bride will have to stop
[1:06:22] preaching for the beast is demanding the
[1:06:24] mark in the hand or forehead if
[1:06:26] permission to preach be granted.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; He said it's going to happen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; So if it happens, praise God. Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; I
[1:06:37] uh let's go with me to Ephesians. Yeah,
[1:06:40] this is my next slide. Let's go to
[1:06:42] Ephesians chapter 4. I just want to sew
[1:06:45] this in while we're here.
[1:06:48] Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:06:56] When Jesus ascended on high, he gave
[1:06:58] gifts unto men. And we pick it up in
[1:07:00] Ephesians 4:11. It says, "And he gave
[1:07:02] some apostles and some prophets and some
[1:07:05] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:07:07] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:07:09] saints for the work of the ministry, for
[1:07:12] the edifying of the body of Christ, till
[1:07:14] we all come in the unity of the faith
[1:07:16] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[1:07:18] and to a perfect man, stature of a
[1:07:20] perfect man, unto the measure of the
[1:07:23] stature of the fullness of Christ, that
[1:07:25] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:07:26] to and fro and carried about with every
[1:07:29] wind of doctrine by the slight of men
[1:07:31] and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie
[1:07:33] and wait to deceive. But speaking the
[1:07:35] truth in love, may grow up unto him in
[1:07:37] all things which is the head, even
[1:07:38] Christ, from whom the whole body fitly
[1:07:40] joined together, and compacted by that
[1:07:42] which every joint supplieth according to
[1:07:44] the effectual working and the measure of
[1:07:46] every part, making increase of the body
[1:07:49] and to the edifying of itself in love.
[1:07:52] So what is the point of preaching?
[1:07:57] because the bride will be forced to stop
[1:07:59] preaching
[1:08:00] because she won't take the mark. And
[1:08:02] when brother Benham comes to the mark of
[1:08:04] the beast, I'll just read it here. He
[1:08:06] says, "Now remember, I think this is
[1:08:09] right." Yeah. Imperial pagan Rome that
[1:08:12] fell by the sword. But she was healed of
[1:08:15] her death stroke when she joined to the
[1:08:16] nominal Christian church of Rome and
[1:08:18] incorporated paganism and Christianity
[1:08:20] and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire
[1:08:23] which was to endure until Jesus came and
[1:08:25] destroyed her. But Rome is not going it
[1:08:27] alone. Her daughters are right there
[1:08:29] with her. And she will take over
[1:08:30] absolute authority by the World Council
[1:08:32] of Churches. This may seem far-fetched,
[1:08:35] but to some, but actually is very plain
[1:08:36] for all to see. Because right now, the
[1:08:39] churches are controlling politics and at
[1:08:41] the opportune time will manifest exactly
[1:08:43] how great is that control. This
[1:08:45] ecumenical move will end up with Rome at
[1:08:48] the head even though the people did not
[1:08:49] envision it that way. This is because in
[1:08:52] Revelation 17:3-6 it states that the
[1:08:54] mystery Babylon is seated on the
[1:08:56] beast. She is controlling the last or
[1:08:58] fourth empire. This Roman church is
[1:09:01] doing that with the world church systems
[1:09:04] under her. Rome will be controlling and
[1:09:07] this image church system will be
[1:09:09] obedient to Rome because Rome controls
[1:09:11] the gold of the world. Thus all the
[1:09:13] people have to belong to the world
[1:09:14] church system or be at the mercy of the
[1:09:17] elements for they cannot buy or sell
[1:09:19] without the mark of the beast in the
[1:09:20] hand or the head. This mark in the head
[1:09:22] means that they will have to take the
[1:09:24] doctrine of the world church systems
[1:09:26] which is trinitarianism etc. Yeah.
[1:09:30] Trinity the destructive force and the
[1:09:33] mark in the hand which means to do the
[1:09:34] will of the church. So so unless you
[1:09:38] receive the mark in the hand or the mark
[1:09:40] in the head you cannot buy and sell.
[1:09:41] There's a boycott. There's a shutting
[1:09:43] down. They're no longer allowed to
[1:09:45] participate. But brother Bam says the
[1:09:47] mark in the head means they have taken
[1:09:49] the doctrine. I'm going to highlight it
[1:09:51] for you because I can do that now.
[1:09:55] The mark in the head means to take the
[1:09:56] doctrine of the world church systems
[1:09:58] with the trinity etc. So that's the mark
[1:10:01] in the head to agree with to accept to
[1:10:03] go along with the teaching and the mark
[1:10:07] in the hand which means to do the will
[1:10:10] of the church. Yeah,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; you obey, you submit, you pay in, you
[1:10:14] you you agree with, you collaborate with
[1:10:17] th with this great power, the church
[1:10:19] system will persecute the true bride.
[1:10:21] This image will try to keep the bride
[1:10:23] from preaching and teaching etc. Her
[1:10:25] ministers will be forbidden to give
[1:10:26] comfort and truth to the people who need
[1:10:28] it. But before the antichrist in person
[1:10:30] takes over his complete world system of
[1:10:32] churches, the true church will be taken
[1:10:34] away from this world to be with the
[1:10:36] Lord. God will catch away his bride for
[1:10:38] the great marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now this this bride who's had
[1:10:44] her eyes open, who's been illuminated by
[1:10:45] the truth. She knows the death of the s
[1:10:47] uh of the system. She knows the death of
[1:10:49] reasoning on the word. She knows the
[1:10:51] death of perverting and hybriding the
[1:10:53] word and not staying with the original
[1:10:54] spoken word. She'll never go into this
[1:10:57] system. And if she doesn't go into this
[1:10:58] system, they will prevent her from
[1:11:00] preaching and teaching. They will shut
[1:11:01] her down, lock the churches, do all the
[1:11:03] things brother Benham said. But I say,
[1:11:05] praise God. What's the purpose of
[1:11:07] preaching? We go back to Ephesians. And
[1:11:09] when we go back to Ephesians chapter 4,
[1:11:11] the purpose of preaching is for the
[1:11:13] perfecting of the saints,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the
[1:11:17] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[1:11:19] all come into the unity of faith and of
[1:11:21] the knowledge of the son of God and to a
[1:11:23] perfect man and to the measure of the
[1:11:25] stature of the till we all come into the
[1:11:27] full stature of a perfect man
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; and reflect Christ. That we henceforth
[1:11:32] be no more children tossed to and fro.
[1:11:33] So that we no more are misled by false
[1:11:36] teaching. Carried about with every wind
[1:11:38] of doctrine, by the slight of men,
[1:11:39] cunning crabies whereby they lie and
[1:11:40] wait to deceive. And speaking the truth
[1:11:42] of love, we grow up into all things and
[1:11:44] to him which is the head. And then the
[1:11:46] whole body is contributing equally their
[1:11:49] portion to the edification of the whole
[1:11:51] body. That's the point of preaching. The
[1:11:53] point of preaching is for our
[1:11:54] perfection, which is full maturity, to
[1:11:56] come into the stature of the fullness of
[1:11:57] of Christ. Amen. To to reflect the life
[1:12:00] of Christ, to grow into the head in all
[1:12:02] things. Amen. to be a joint that
[1:12:04] supplies. And so when God shuts the
[1:12:06] doors on the church and stops the
[1:12:08] preaching, it means the preaching has
[1:12:09] met its objective. The bride is now
[1:12:12] mature.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Don't cry when they lock the doors. When
[1:12:15] they stop the preaching, I will be in
[1:12:17] retirement. Amen. I'll no longer be
[1:12:19] preaching the gospel because the
[1:12:21] preaching will have accomplished its
[1:12:22] objective. The bride is now ready to
[1:12:25] make her final stand where every member
[1:12:27] has the word. Every member's grown into
[1:12:30] the character of Christ. And she won't
[1:12:31] back down. She's predestinated not to.
[1:12:34] Every mother, every child, every boy and
[1:12:36] girl, older person, elderly, widow,
[1:12:38] married, they're going to make that
[1:12:40] stand and say, "I won't compromise on
[1:12:42] the word for nothing." And they won't
[1:12:44] need a preacher to hold their hand to do
[1:12:45] it because they've grown into the
[1:12:47] stature of the fullness of Christ, the
[1:12:49] full reflection of the word on this
[1:12:51] earth in bride form.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to the day they stop
[1:12:56] the preaching.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's why we're preaching. We're not
[1:13:00] we're not disturbed by that idea. We're
[1:13:02] blessed by that idea because God's not
[1:13:05] going to let us stop until it's
[1:13:06] accomplished a purpose. When it's
[1:13:08] accomplishes a purpose, God will let us
[1:13:10] stop because now he wants to show
[1:13:12] himself in her.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That's why we come Sunday and Wednesday.
[1:13:20] That's why we're here to grow into this
[1:13:22] so that God can allow that system to bar
[1:13:25] the doors and shut the preacher's mouth
[1:13:27] and stop it because now he's saying you
[1:13:29] don't need that anymore. You've come to
[1:13:31] the place I wanted to get you. Amen.
[1:13:33] Because brother Brandham said at that
[1:13:34] end time he's going to take that little
[1:13:36] bride, lift her up here and say this was
[1:13:38] her and then away he goes with her.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to try to interpret that
[1:13:42] and tell you I know exactly what it
[1:13:44] means. But it shows to me it's a
[1:13:45] two-stage process. He's going to lift
[1:13:47] her up and show her off to the world.
[1:13:49] this is her and then he goes away with
[1:13:51] it.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; If you can't come to church, you just
[1:13:57] got to realize you are the church. You
[1:13:59] are Christ. The word is in you. You
[1:14:01] don't need to go hear the word. You've
[1:14:02] become the word.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; In fullness. It's come to its pinnacle.
[1:14:07] It's come to the peak. It's come to the
[1:14:09] point of the message.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything Brother Brandon
[1:14:12] preached, everything we keep rehearsing,
[1:14:14] everything we're coming here for is for
[1:14:16] this glorious purpose that this bride
[1:14:19] will be him standing upon the earth. The
[1:14:22] fullness of that word made flesh again
[1:14:24] on this earth just like it was 2,000
[1:14:27] years ago. Now it's not in a singular
[1:14:28] body. Now it's in a many membered bride
[1:14:31] body, but it's the same life with the
[1:14:32] same manifestation with the same
[1:14:34] obedience to the father.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:39] Don't ever read those quotes again and
[1:14:41] shake. Don't ever read those quotes
[1:14:43] again and mourn. Don't ever read those
[1:14:45] quotes again because that's going to be
[1:14:47] our graduation day.
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Praise be unto God.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And to me, this answers the question
[1:14:56] because so many people struggle with if
[1:14:59] the Lord has come,
[1:15:01] if Christ is here, why do we still have
[1:15:04] a five-fold ministry? The perfect word
[1:15:06] has been delivered. And so maybe I
[1:15:09] should just listen to the tapes and
[1:15:11] maybe I shouldn't live a fifthful
[1:15:13] ministry because they're men. They make
[1:15:14] mistakes and and that's absolutely 100%
[1:15:17] the truth and they'll all get it wrong
[1:15:19] which is absolutely 100% the truth. But
[1:15:22] that's how God builds our faith.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] But for me, some people have stopped
[1:15:33] taking communion because Paul says, "We
[1:15:36] do this and show his death till he has
[1:15:37] come."
[1:15:39] And we know the Lord has come.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; But we also know the Lord is coming.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He's got to come and establish his
[1:15:49] throne upon the earth during the
[1:15:50] millennium.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; And the question is, who what right do
[1:15:53] we have to do to determine which coming
[1:15:55] he was referring to? Right.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; The last message brother Brandham
[1:15:59] preached in was communion message. One
[1:16:01] of the last things he did in church was
[1:16:02] take communion with the saints before
[1:16:04] his death.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; What right do we have to know more than
[1:16:08] the prophet or figure out more than him?
[1:16:10] He was there telling people to preach.
[1:16:12] He was telling them come to church. Come
[1:16:14] and listen to brother Perry. That was
[1:16:15] some of the last things he was telling.
[1:16:17] We have a great church now to come
[1:16:18] together and bring our children. When
[1:16:20] did we get so smart that we could
[1:16:21] outsmart God and outsmart God's prophet
[1:16:24] and say, "Well, he didn't really mean
[1:16:25] that. I'm supposed to catch the secret
[1:16:26] revelation. I don't need fivefold
[1:16:27] ministry and I don't need to take
[1:16:29] communion. No, friends. When God is done
[1:16:31] with that, he'll be done with that. God
[1:16:34] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:16:36] pass.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And he'll do it by this system shutting
[1:16:40] down the preaching and teaching and the
[1:16:42] churches.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Until then, let's do what the prophet
[1:16:45] told us to do. Let's do what the Bible
[1:16:46] tells us to do. Let's proclaim it. Let's
[1:16:48] preach it. Let's gather together. Let's
[1:16:50] assemble together and not forsake the
[1:16:52] assembling together of ourselves. Let's
[1:16:54] stay with every word and we're going to
[1:16:56] keep doing every word because I'm not
[1:16:57] going to use my reasoning and my
[1:16:59] deduction and my interpretation of the
[1:17:01] message to decide no, we don't no longer
[1:17:03] need this, we don't no longer need that.
[1:17:04] I'm going to keep doing what the word
[1:17:06] says until he bars the doors, till he
[1:17:09] shuts it down. And when he stops it and
[1:17:11] I'm arrested and I'm sitting in prison
[1:17:13] and you all are scattered everywhere,
[1:17:15] I'll say, "Praise God, he accomplished
[1:17:17] his goal.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; The sermons were worth something. They
[1:17:20] meant it. the sacrifices, all the work
[1:17:23] to have a church, all the labor that
[1:17:24] goes into keeping a building and coming
[1:17:26] together and having an audio system and
[1:17:28] preaching an internet, it finally
[1:17:30] accomplished what it was supposed to
[1:17:31] accomplish.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; If you hear of me winding up in prison
[1:17:34] because I won't stop.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Don't mourn for me. I'll be the happiest
[1:17:40] man on the earth because all that I gave
[1:17:42] my life for meant something at that
[1:17:44] point.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; What Brother Bam gave his life for was
[1:17:48] accomplished.
[1:17:50] Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. What looks like the
[1:17:53] worst of times is always the best of
[1:17:55] times.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a test of whether we
[1:18:00] believe the prophecy or not.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And I said, "God, help me to believe
[1:18:06] this prophecy."
[1:18:08] Oh, friends, it just seems like you want
[1:18:10] to preach everything. Just keep going.
[1:18:13] Keep going.
[1:18:15] Everything's become so alive. Do you
[1:18:17] feel that?
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:19] Every word the prophet said, every
[1:18:21] prophecy, every message, it's becoming
[1:18:22] so alive, so tangible, so real, such a
[1:18:26] force inside of me that wants to be
[1:18:27] expressed. And I don't even know how. I
[1:18:29] don't even know what. I don't even know
[1:18:30] how. I don't even know how to verbalize
[1:18:32] what's going on. I don't even know how
[1:18:34] to put it in action. But some little
[1:18:36] spring way down the inside is pushing
[1:18:38] me. Amen. It's bubbling up of its own
[1:18:40] accord.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I thank God for it.
[1:18:45] Amen. Let's see if we can read a little
[1:18:47] further. Let's go back to our little
[1:18:49] booklet here on page 8.
[1:18:52] Amen.
[1:18:56] Says paragraph 153-3.
[1:19:00] Now remember that Moses was born for a
[1:19:02] certain work.
[1:19:04] But he could not do that work until he'd
[1:19:06] received the gifts which would enable
[1:19:08] him to do the work. He had to go out in
[1:19:10] the desert and wait there. God had an
[1:19:12] appointed time. There was to be a
[1:19:14] certain pharaoh on the throne and the
[1:19:17] people had to be crying for bread of
[1:19:18] life before God could send him back.
[1:19:20] This is true for our day. Before brother
[1:19:22] Brandham could move into the latter
[1:19:24] reign ministry, the third pull, the
[1:19:25] opening of the seals, there had to be a
[1:19:27] certain pharaoh on the throne.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Had to come to that sign of a Catholic
[1:19:32] uh uh president and and and brother
[1:19:35] Brandham, you know, brother Brandham is
[1:19:36] so gracious and so human
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; that he never speaks bad of John F.
[1:19:41] Kenny because it has nothing to do with
[1:19:42] John F. Kennedy.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't know him. He's a good
[1:19:46] man. He'll probably make a good
[1:19:48] president and probably do a good job."
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam had no beef against the man.
[1:19:52] It wasn't the man. Nothing wrong with
[1:19:53] the man. Brother Bam thought he was a
[1:19:55] good man. It was the system that Jezebel
[1:19:57] system he was attached to.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam saw his symbolism. Even
[1:20:02] after JFK was assassinated, Brother Bam
[1:20:04] said the kindest things. Yeah.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; had the congregation stand and pray
[1:20:09] prayed for him and pray for his wife and
[1:20:11] said, "No matter if I disagree with a
[1:20:13] man or not, nobody deserves to be gunned
[1:20:14] down like that." And the poor wife and
[1:20:16] those poor little children. He was a
[1:20:18] human being with compassion and love. It
[1:20:20] wasn't the person. He was looking at the
[1:20:22] spiritual application.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And so there had to be a certain pharaoh
[1:20:28] on the throne before. That's why brother
[1:20:29] Bam is preaching this message, spoken
[1:20:31] words seed. That's why he's struggling
[1:20:33] with what to come next because he's in
[1:20:35] the holding pattern. He has brought
[1:20:37] back, amen, the original faith of the
[1:20:38] original fathers. Amen. He's tied
[1:20:40] together the loose ends and brought us
[1:20:42] back to the foundational teachings of
[1:20:44] the apostles. And now they need to go
[1:20:47] into the next step, but he can't go. And
[1:20:49] he's in this holding period and the
[1:20:50] revival's dying back and he doesn't know
[1:20:52] what's going to happen next. And
[1:20:54] meetings are getting cancelled and he's
[1:20:55] not getting the calls he used to get.
[1:20:57] And even later on, God will tell him not
[1:20:59] to travel overseas and and to stay home
[1:21:01] and and store up the food to make the
[1:21:03] tapes. And all of this is happening and
[1:21:05] he's struggling with this and and and
[1:21:07] now all of a sudden the spirit of the
[1:21:09] Lord is telling him, "Listen, hey, hey,
[1:21:12] Moses had to wait for a certain
[1:21:13] Pharaoh." Amen. John the Baptist had to
[1:21:16] wait for a certain time. Amen. And
[1:21:17] you're waiting for a certain Pharaoh to
[1:21:20] rise on the throne and the appointed
[1:21:22] time you'll come forth. Lord,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; then let's keep going.
[1:21:28] But what do we have in this our day?
[1:21:31] Multitudes are working signs until we
[1:21:33] have a generation of sign seekers that
[1:21:35] know little or nothing about the word or
[1:21:38] a true move of the spirit of God. I I
[1:21:41] want to talk about this just for a
[1:21:42] minute. Brother Benam is here. He's in
[1:21:45] the the the the uh the hangover of the
[1:21:48] of the Pentecostal revival and the
[1:21:51] beginning of the charismatic movement is
[1:21:52] all taking place around him. And he's
[1:21:55] beginning to see that what started off
[1:21:56] true was now moving. And it was moving
[1:21:59] after signs, but not moving after the
[1:22:01] word. And remember, this message comes,
[1:22:03] this message from the spirit of of the
[1:22:05] Lord comes at a time he's preaching
[1:22:08] spoken word is the original seed. So,
[1:22:10] it's all about getting back to the
[1:22:12] original seed.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The original word. And so now in this by
[1:22:16] the anointing of the spirit he's writing
[1:22:19] uh they know little or they're sign
[1:22:21] seekers that know little or nothing
[1:22:23] about the word or a true move of the
[1:22:26] spirit of God. If they see blood, oil,
[1:22:29] fire, they are happy. It matters not
[1:22:30] what the what the it matters not what is
[1:22:33] in the word. They will support any sign
[1:22:36] even unscriptural ones.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; But God has warned us about that. He
[1:22:42] said in in Matthew 24 that in the last
[1:22:44] days the two spirits would be so close
[1:22:46] together that only the very elect would
[1:22:48] tell them apart for they alone would not
[1:22:51] be deceived.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Can you underline that?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; They alone would not be deceived.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Everyone else will be deceived but the
[1:23:01] predestinated the elect bride of Christ
[1:23:04] will not be deceived
[1:23:06] because he promised you wouldn't.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] in Deuteronomy, brother uh uh Moses here
[1:23:13] is is talking to Israel and he's giving
[1:23:15] them the word of the Lord. He's talking
[1:23:18] about prophets and signs and if it comes
[1:23:20] to pass, listen to him. But in
[1:23:21] Deuteronomy 13, he says this, "If there
[1:23:24] arise among you a prophet or a dreamer
[1:23:26] of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a
[1:23:28] wonder, and the sign or the wonder come
[1:23:31] to pass,
[1:23:33] where whereof he spoken to thee, saying,
[1:23:35] Let us go after other gods, which thou
[1:23:38] hast not known, and let us serve them.
[1:23:40] Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of
[1:23:43] that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams.
[1:23:45] For the Lord your God proveth you to
[1:23:47] know whether you love the Lord your God
[1:23:49] with all your heart and with all your
[1:23:51] soul.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; All the way back in the book of
[1:23:54] Deuteronomy, all the way back in the
[1:23:56] Exodus, Moses was warning them about
[1:23:58] this. Amen. If a prophet or a dreamer
[1:24:00] comes to comes to you with a sign or a
[1:24:02] wonder and what he says comes to pass.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Now you understand that's the
[1:24:07] vindication of a prophet. Right.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; But he leads you to another god, to
[1:24:13] another teaching, to
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; We bring that home today.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; If he leads you to another word,
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; y
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; another truth. Well, it says unto other
[1:24:25] gods,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; what is the word?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; It's God.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; It's God expressed. It's the thought of
[1:24:33] God, which is God expressed to us. The
[1:24:35] word is God. Brother said, "God is the
[1:24:38] word." And if somebody else will
[1:24:39] compromise, hybrid, change that word and
[1:24:42] alter that word and bring another word,
[1:24:43] they've brought another God.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the fallacy of
[1:24:47] denominationalism. And that's that's
[1:24:49] what it's produced. But they have signs
[1:24:51] and wonders, friends. It's not a problem
[1:24:52] of working miracles. I grew up in a
[1:24:54] Pentecostal atmosphere. I saw miracles.
[1:24:56] I saw healings. I saw tongues and
[1:24:58] interpretation. I saw things that were
[1:25:00] true and things that were real and
[1:25:01] things that were genuine and things that
[1:25:03] happened. Amen. But if it leads you into
[1:25:05] it leads you away from God to another
[1:25:07] God which is a false understanding of
[1:25:09] the word. He says then don't you follow
[1:25:11] it and don't you go after it because the
[1:25:13] most important thing is the spoken word
[1:25:16] is the original seed. And if you stick
[1:25:18] with the original seed it'll always
[1:25:20] reproduce itself.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Don't hybrid it. And so brother's
[1:25:26] warning the church don't be signers.
[1:25:29] Don't don't go that direction. Don't be
[1:25:31] caught up in that. Watch the word. Watch
[1:25:33] the word. Watch the word. That's why God
[1:25:36] sent a prophet to bring us back to the
[1:25:37] word. He sent a word prophet to restore
[1:25:40] what? The word. With that came signs and
[1:25:42] wonders and miracles, all the
[1:25:43] vindications that had to be there. But
[1:25:45] the purpose of his ministry was to bring
[1:25:47] us back to the word to bring the people
[1:25:49] back in contact with their God.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And he's trying to tell the people,
[1:25:57] don't go that way.
[1:25:59] Matthew 24:24 says, "For there shall
[1:26:02] arise false Christ." This is where,
[1:26:04] brother, the scripture, false anointed
[1:26:05] ones.
[1:26:07] False Christs plural, not Jesus Christ,
[1:26:10] but anointed ones saying, "I'm anointed
[1:26:12] of the Lord." Amen. And brother
[1:26:14] Brandman, false anointed ones teaches us
[1:26:16] they have healings.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; They have faith.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; They have all of these things. But what
[1:26:22] they don't have is the spo the original
[1:26:25] spoken word.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; For there shall rise false Christ and
[1:26:29] false prophets and shall show great
[1:26:32] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:26:34] were possible they should deceive the
[1:26:36] very elect. So what was going to deceive
[1:26:38] the very elect? Showing signs great
[1:26:41] signs and wonders.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say they'd all be false.
[1:26:45] Don't believe them. They're just
[1:26:46] pretending. No, he said they shall show.
[1:26:49] They shall definite affirmative in the
[1:26:52] future. Shall show. That's a hard to
[1:26:55] say. Shall show. Say that five times
[1:26:57] fast. Shall show great signs and wonders
[1:27:02] in so much that if it were possible,
[1:27:04] they should deceive the very elect.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; You know what I love about this?
[1:27:10] The statement between the commas.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; What is the statement between the
[1:27:17] commas? If it were possible,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad it's impossible. Amen.
[1:27:24] because of God's predestinated plan and
[1:27:26] his will for my life. It's possible for
[1:27:28] me to be deceived as a human being. Very
[1:27:30] possible. I'm gullible. I fall for
[1:27:32] stuff. I believe people. If they just
[1:27:34] look at me and say, "I'm telling you the
[1:27:35] truth." I say, "Okay, I believe you. Why
[1:27:37] would you lie to me?"
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to election and
[1:27:41] predestination, it is impossible for
[1:27:43] this elect to be deceived.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; But there will be great signs and
[1:27:48] wonders. So, we don't chase the signs
[1:27:50] and wonders. We chase after the word.
[1:27:52] Right.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; That's what he's teaching us here.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And and this message said, "The Bible
[1:27:59] said in Matthew 24 that I would come to
[1:28:01] pass in the last days till it would
[1:28:04] deceive the very elect if possible." I
[1:28:06] heard Billy Graham say the other day in
[1:28:08] a message, he said, "The elected is
[1:28:10] already deceived." Brother says, "No,
[1:28:13] no, the elected ain't going to be
[1:28:15] deceived. No, no, they won't be. No,
[1:28:18] church members will, but not the
[1:28:20] elected. They was chosen from the
[1:28:22] foundation of the world. They cannot be
[1:28:23] deceived. It's impossible. Said Hebrews
[1:28:26] 6. They will not be deceived.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We don't have to be afraid.
[1:28:31] Listen, friends, don't be afraid.
[1:28:33] There's so many times that we're afraid
[1:28:35] to be deceived. So, we're afraid to hear
[1:28:37] something different. We're afraid to
[1:28:39] listen to what's being preached from
[1:28:41] somebody else. Listen, we don't have to
[1:28:42] be afraid of being deceived. What we
[1:28:44] need to do is study the genuine dollar
[1:28:46] bill until we know what the prophet
[1:28:48] said, till we understand the tone, the
[1:28:51] nature, the character of the prophet
[1:28:52] coming through those messages. And
[1:28:54] listen, I tell you, you you feed on that
[1:28:57] true dollar bill. And you listen not
[1:28:59] just to the words that's being said, but
[1:29:01] listen to the way he's saying it, the
[1:29:03] character behind it, the life and the
[1:29:05] humility and all the things that go with
[1:29:07] it, and the love that is preached with,
[1:29:09] the obedience to the father. And listen
[1:29:11] to me. That becomes the test of true
[1:29:13] ministry. Amen. Not just the words, but
[1:29:16] the character behind the words.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; The presentation with the life.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; So study the true dollar bill. And don't
[1:29:23] be afraid of being deceived. If you're a
[1:29:25] child of God, you cannot be deceived.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It's prophesied. It's it's it's
[1:29:31] predestinated. It's the will and plan of
[1:29:34] God. He brought his word and he brought
[1:29:35] his spirit in full measure to make sure
[1:29:37] you're not deceived. And it it doesn't
[1:29:39] mean that you won't ever misunderstand
[1:29:41] anything. It doesn't mean you won't take
[1:29:42] a detour. It doesn't mean you won't get
[1:29:44] derailed for a period of time. But
[1:29:46] you're not going to stay there as the
[1:29:48] predestinated seg of God. God will bring
[1:29:50] the word your way. And he will use the
[1:29:53] word to break the stronghold of
[1:29:55] misunderstanding, wrong doctrine, false
[1:29:57] teaching.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Because we can't be deceived.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; So we don't have to be afraid of the
[1:30:05] message.
[1:30:07] We don't have to be afraid of the deeper
[1:30:08] things. We don't have to be afraid.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to pretend like we
[1:30:12] understand things we don't understand
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; because it's not about understanding.
[1:30:17] It's about receiving. It's about living.
[1:30:19] It's about allowing God to bring
[1:30:21] revelation.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; So, we don't have to be afraid of the
[1:30:23] message. Just relax. Enjoy the word.
[1:30:26] Feed on the word and let the word
[1:30:28] reproduce itself in us.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose his bride. He
[1:30:33] can't lose himself.
[1:30:35] And Christ is the mystery of God
[1:30:37] revealed. He says, "And Satan said, you
[1:30:39] know, but she turned around and listened
[1:30:41] to him." But the eve in the last day is
[1:30:44] not going to do it because she's
[1:30:46] predestinated not to do it. Yes, sir.
[1:30:48] God's going to do it. He knows. He'll
[1:30:50] have it. He said uh uh a church would be
[1:30:53] there without spot or wrinkle. She is
[1:30:55] going to stand there in the splendor of
[1:30:57] him, his word made manifest. I want to
[1:31:01] ask you a question.
[1:31:03] What is the splendor of him?
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; His word made manifest.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; That's his objective in this day. That's
[1:31:12] what he's talking about. What was Jesus?
[1:31:15] He was the word made manifest.
[1:31:18] What is his bride going to be? The word
[1:31:20] made manifest.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Let's continue reading just a little bit
[1:31:24] longer.
[1:31:26] Paragraph 175-5. How can you tell the
[1:31:29] spirits apart? Just give them the word
[1:31:31] test.
[1:31:32] If it's not what the prophet taught,
[1:31:34] leave it alone. It's not in our Bibles.
[1:31:36] If it's not the scripture, if it's not
[1:31:38] been taught by the prophet, leave it
[1:31:39] alone. If they don't speak that word,
[1:31:42] they are of the evil one. As the evil
[1:31:44] one deceived the first two brides, he
[1:31:46] will try to deceive the bride of this
[1:31:48] last day by trying to get her to
[1:31:50] hybridize herself with creeds as
[1:31:53] something other than what God delivered
[1:31:55] to us through the prophet.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Right? or just plainly turning from the
[1:32:02] word to any sign that suits her.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So not putting by deceiving her by not
[1:32:08] putting the emphasis on the restored
[1:32:10] word but putting it on signs.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; And the absence of restored word,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; turning her attention. But listen, but
[1:32:19] God never placed signs ahead of the
[1:32:22] word.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Signs follow the word. If we want signs
[1:32:27] and wonders, let's dig into this word.
[1:32:30] Let's receive the word and let's believe
[1:32:31] the word he gave us because the word
[1:32:34] promises signs and wonders. It promises
[1:32:36] healing. It promises deliverance. It
[1:32:38] promises laying on of hands. It promises
[1:32:41] the gifts of the spirit. It's all part
[1:32:42] of the word. So get the word. Brother
[1:32:45] Brandham said, "When when I go to buy my
[1:32:47] shoes, I don't just buy the tongue. I
[1:32:49] buy the whole shoe and I get the tongue
[1:32:51] with it." And he's talking about the
[1:32:52] gifts. What I want is the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:54] What I want is God. What I want is him.
[1:32:56] And when I unite with him, everything
[1:32:58] that he is is included.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And he can manifest any of it anytime he
[1:33:03] wants. But he needs a heart that
[1:33:05] believes it and is expecting it and
[1:33:06] looking for it.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But not getting chasing signs,
[1:33:11] chasing the word, and believing that
[1:33:13] this word, God, I have followed your
[1:33:15] word, and your word says, and I expect
[1:33:16] you to do what your word says because
[1:33:18] I'm holding on to the original spoken
[1:33:20] word, which has to reproduce itself. And
[1:33:23] if your word says by your stripes I am
[1:33:25] healed. That word has to reproduce
[1:33:27] itself. It's not hybrid in my heart. I'm
[1:33:29] believing the original spoken word.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Go to the word and the signs will
[1:33:34] follow.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Believe it on the basis of the word.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] Praise God. Signs follow the word. As
[1:33:45] when Elijah told the woman to bake a
[1:33:46] cake for him first, according to the
[1:33:48] word of the Lord, when she did as the
[1:33:50] word said, the proper sign came.
[1:33:53] Come to the word first.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; This is what he's teaching us in the day
[1:33:58] of Pentecostalism, in the day of the
[1:34:00] beginning of the charismatic move, signs
[1:34:01] and wonders, and all the things that
[1:34:02] were going around. All the fanaticism
[1:34:04] that spoke up, sprung up after his
[1:34:06] ministry, he's crying out to it. Come
[1:34:09] back to the word. It's all in the word.
[1:34:12] Everything you desire is in the word.
[1:34:19] Come to the word first and then watch
[1:34:22] the miracles.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; The miracle, the seed word is energized
[1:34:27] by the spirit.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's look at this story in
[1:34:33] first kings 17. The story of Elijah
[1:34:37] and the widow woman.
[1:34:43] First Kings chapter 17.
[1:34:53] Remember friends, we're coming in an
[1:34:56] Elijah ministry
[1:35:02] and
[1:35:04] God
[1:35:06] has ordained this woman to sustain him
[1:35:09] in the time of famine.
[1:35:12] So now he comes to her in chapter 17:8.
[1:35:17] And the word of the Lord came to him
[1:35:19] saying, "Arise, get thee into Zerapath,
[1:35:22] which belongth to Zidon, and dwell
[1:35:23] there. Behold, I have commanded a widow
[1:35:25] woman there to sustain thee." Hey, guess
[1:35:28] what? The widow woman didn't get the
[1:35:30] message.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; The carrier never showed up because this
[1:35:35] plan was in the mind of God and it was
[1:35:37] going to manifest that. She didn't know.
[1:35:40] She didn't know that she was commanded
[1:35:43] to be the widow woman that sustained
[1:35:45] him. But she was the widow woman that
[1:35:47] was commanded to sustain him. So what
[1:35:49] was she going to do? Sustain him.
[1:35:50] Because she was commanded to do so even
[1:35:52] though she didn't get a memo.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; This is how God works, friends. He's
[1:35:58] already ordered our life. He's already
[1:35:59] commanded us to do things. And it will
[1:36:01] happen. Even if you don't have the memo,
[1:36:03] it's going to happen. Just trust that
[1:36:05] God's commanded your life and he's
[1:36:07] commanded a purpose in your life.
[1:36:10] I've commanded a widow woman there to
[1:36:11] sustain thee. So he arose and he went to
[1:36:15] Zerapath. And when he came to the gate
[1:36:17] of the city, behold, the widow woman was
[1:36:19] there gathering of sticks. And he called
[1:36:22] her and he said, "Fetch me, I pray thee,
[1:36:24] a little water in a vessel that I may
[1:36:26] drink." And as she was going to fetch
[1:36:28] it, he called her and said, "Bring me, I
[1:36:30] pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy
[1:36:33] hand." And she said, "As the Lord thy
[1:36:35] God liveth, I have not a cake, but a
[1:36:37] handful of meal in a barrel and a little
[1:36:40] oil and a cruise. Behold, I'm gathering
[1:36:43] two sticks that I may go in and dress it
[1:36:45] for me and my son, that we may eat it
[1:36:48] and die." Listen, this is the condition
[1:36:50] of the church when Elijah's on the
[1:36:52] scene.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; The denominational system has devoured
[1:36:57] the word.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Because the meal is a type of Christ,
[1:37:00] the meal offering. She's down to the
[1:37:03] last little bit of truth,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And I've only got a drop of oil. I just
[1:37:10] got a little bit of the spirit of God
[1:37:12] and a little bit of the word because
[1:37:13] these two go hand in hand.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; And she goes, "I'm going to bake that
[1:37:18] cake and die."
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; But she wasn't going to die because God
[1:37:24] had sent Elijah her way. Yeah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And and and
[1:37:30] so she says, "I I am gathering two
[1:37:33] sticks." Brother Beam said those two
[1:37:35] sticks made the cross over the fire. She
[1:37:37] had just all she had was the cross and a
[1:37:40] little bit of meal and a little bit of
[1:37:41] oil and it was the last bit she had to
[1:37:43] sustain her spiritual life.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Then Elijah shows up in the time of
[1:37:49] drought.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "And Elijah said unto
[1:37:56] her, Fear not. Go and do as as thou has
[1:38:00] said, but make me thereof a little cake
[1:38:03] first,
[1:38:05] and bring it unto me, and then after
[1:38:07] make for thee and for thy son." The
[1:38:10] audacity of this man. Listen, if we knew
[1:38:13] if we knew a fellow like this, we would
[1:38:15] call him all kinds of names.
[1:38:17] You you a man in full strength go to a
[1:38:20] widow woman with a little boy and she's
[1:38:22] got the last bed and she's going to give
[1:38:23] it to them and die their last morsel and
[1:38:25] you said no listen you just give that to
[1:38:27] me first. What kind of human being are
[1:38:30] you? He's a human being. He knows that
[1:38:32] God is in him. Amen. He is the
[1:38:34] manifested word for that hour because
[1:38:36] brother Brandham said the prophet
[1:38:37] becomes the word to the age. And Elijah
[1:38:40] was the manifestation of the word for
[1:38:41] that age. And he was coming to bring her
[1:38:43] something more than her last drop of
[1:38:45] meal. He was going to bring her more
[1:38:47] than their last drop of oil. He was
[1:38:48] going to bring her in abundance. But she
[1:38:51] had to be willing to give all unto this
[1:38:53] ministry and sacrifice everything to
[1:38:55] him. And when she sacrificed, it wasn't
[1:38:58] Elijah. Brother Bam said it was Christ
[1:38:59] in Elijah. And when she sacrificed to
[1:39:02] the living word for her day and gave her
[1:39:04] last bit of understanding, her last bit
[1:39:05] of spiritual life, everything. And she
[1:39:07] handed it over to this end time
[1:39:10] ministry. Amen. To this word made flesh.
[1:39:12] He made a promise. And the promise comes
[1:39:14] here in verse 14. He said, "For thus
[1:39:18] saith the Lord God of Israel, the barrel
[1:39:21] of meal shall not waste, neither shall
[1:39:23] the cruise of oil fail until until the
[1:39:25] day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the
[1:39:27] earth." And she went and did according
[1:39:30] to the saying of Elijah. And she and he
[1:39:33] in her house did eat many days, and the
[1:39:35] barrel of meal wasted not. Neither did
[1:39:37] the cruise of oil fail according to the
[1:39:39] word of the Lord which he spake by
[1:39:42] Elijah. That wasn't Elijah's word. That
[1:39:45] was God's word because God was working
[1:39:47] through Elijah. And God was saying
[1:39:49] through Elijah, "Give me your last. Give
[1:39:52] me all you've got. Give me everything.
[1:39:54] And if you give it to me, I'll give you
[1:39:57] everything you need to sustain you all
[1:39:59] the way through. Right.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we come to the message, we
[1:40:04] have a little bit of truth. When we're
[1:40:05] afraid to lose our little bit of truth,
[1:40:07] I know that Jesus Christ, son of God, I
[1:40:09] was raised this way. I've got just a
[1:40:11] little bit of life and a little bit of
[1:40:12] this. Amen. But God's saying, don't hold
[1:40:15] on to that and die. Don't just eat that
[1:40:17] meager. Amen. But give it over to the
[1:40:19] manifested word for your hour, and your
[1:40:21] cruise will not go empty, and your
[1:40:23] barrel shall not run dry. You're going
[1:40:25] to have word upon word upon word. And
[1:40:28] listen, it doesn't mean that she went
[1:40:30] over and she saw the the meal barrel
[1:40:31] overflowing and spilling into the floor.
[1:40:33] It may have been as low as it ever was,
[1:40:35] but under the Elijah anointing, when
[1:40:37] Elijah was in her house, when Elijah was
[1:40:40] in her house, every time she dipped in,
[1:40:43] there was something to eat. Amen. Every
[1:40:45] time she needed it, there was some oil
[1:40:47] on the word to bring it to pass and give
[1:40:49] her the spiritual nutrition to face the
[1:40:51] day. Every day Elijah was with her, she
[1:40:55] had something to eat. Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we come back. Listen, I
[1:41:00] I've come this Sunday. I woke up. I've
[1:41:02] woken up many a Monday morning things
[1:41:04] that Lord Jesus, I I preached everything
[1:41:06] that's in my heart. I have nothing else
[1:41:08] left.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; We're going to go Wednesday and play a
[1:41:13] tape, read a book, do something. I'm
[1:41:15] done. But friends, every day there's
[1:41:18] meal in the barrel. There's oil in the
[1:41:20] cruise because because this Elijah
[1:41:22] ministry is in the house. Amen.
[1:41:26] Yes.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Don't go after signs. Go after the word.
[1:41:31] Amen. Give the word. Give up everything.
[1:41:34] And all you get what you get is word and
[1:41:36] spirit. Word and spirit. Word and spirit
[1:41:38] to sustain a spiritual life. Amen. When
[1:41:40] the rest of the world has fallen into
[1:41:42] drought, we're eating just fine. Amen.
[1:41:44] When the rest of the spiritual world's
[1:41:46] gone into apostasy, a complete blackout,
[1:41:48] utter starvation spiritually and
[1:41:50] weakening, we're eating just fine. Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Every day there's meal in the barrel.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Seek the word first. Seek the word for
[1:42:00] your age first and all these things
[1:42:02] shall be added unto me.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; It's the lesson we're trying to get
[1:42:07] here.
[1:42:09] Brother Bam goes on. We'll continue on
[1:42:11] in page nine.
[1:42:15] Says, "How can any messenger sent from
[1:42:18] God believe only a part of the word and
[1:42:20] deny some of it? The true prophet of God
[1:42:23] in this last day will proclaim the whole
[1:42:25] word. Denominations will hate him. Why
[1:42:28] will they hate him? Because the true
[1:42:31] word always exposes the lie.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; They will hate him not because he's mean
[1:42:37] to them. And they'll hate him not
[1:42:39] because he's a bad person. They'll hate
[1:42:41] him because he tears down their
[1:42:43] structure,
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; their false structure. His words may be
[1:42:48] as harsh as John the Baptist who called
[1:42:50] him vipers, but the predestinated will
[1:42:53] hear and be ready for the rapture. You
[1:42:56] might want to circle that word will.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; There's no hope so attached to that. The
[1:43:01] predestinated will hear and be ready for
[1:43:05] the rapture. You ain't going to miss it.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "The royal seed of
[1:43:10] Abraham with like faith as Abraham will
[1:43:12] hold to the word with him for they are
[1:43:14] predestinated together."
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, that widow woman was
[1:43:20] predestinated with Elijah.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; And this bride in the end time is
[1:43:25] predestinated with Amen. the Elijah
[1:43:27] ministry in the end time. She's
[1:43:29] predestinated with this message.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And she will hold on to it because she's
[1:43:33] predestinated with him. It wasn't just
[1:43:35] Brother Brandon that came predestinated.
[1:43:37] You came predestinated to believe it.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; He came predestinated to believe it and
[1:43:41] preach it. You came predestinated to
[1:43:42] believe it and live it.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:49] It says now the predestin the royal seed
[1:43:52] of Abraham. I'm going back and reading
[1:43:53] the sentence again with like faith is
[1:43:56] Abraham's.
[1:43:58] So the the royal seed of Abraham, the
[1:44:01] royal seed of Abraham is the faith seed
[1:44:02] of Abraham, which is the Christ seed,
[1:44:04] which is the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:44:05] because she can live by faith in the
[1:44:07] word. And Abraham proved who he was by
[1:44:10] being able to receive the word for his
[1:44:12] day.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; And the bride is the royal seed of
[1:44:15] Abraham because she'll receive the word
[1:44:18] for her day.
[1:44:20] And he says of Abraham's faith in
[1:44:22] Romans, therefore it is of faith that it
[1:44:25] might be by grace to the end the promise
[1:44:27] might be shured to all the seed. Not to
[1:44:30] that which only is of the law, but to
[1:44:31] that also which is of the faith of
[1:44:33] Abraham, who's the father of us all. As
[1:44:35] it is written, I have made thee a father
[1:44:37] of many nations.
[1:44:39] You know, I love this. I've been through
[1:44:42] the scripture with you all many times,
[1:44:43] but if you'll just bear with me, I can't
[1:44:45] stop. I can't help but comment. Yeah,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; he made it. Therefore, it is a faith
[1:44:50] that it might be by grace to the end the
[1:44:52] promise might be sure to all the seed.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Not to just those that are law, but that
[1:44:56] also which is the faith of Abraham,
[1:44:58] which is the father of us all.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; If Abraham's my father, then I'm part of
[1:45:03] the Abrahamic covenant, which is a
[1:45:05] covenant of grace, unconditional grace.
[1:45:08] I will do. Not what you do, I will.
[1:45:10] Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; And what what makes me a part of this
[1:45:13] covenant of grace is he made it by
[1:45:16] faith. So that the only evidence I need
[1:45:20] and the only action I need to be a
[1:45:22] partaker of this covenant is the faith
[1:45:25] to believe the word for my day.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; In this whole thing, uh Paul, he's
[1:45:32] contrasting works and law, the works of
[1:45:35] the law with faith and grace. And he's
[1:45:38] trying to show that it's not by the
[1:45:39] works because if it was by works then
[1:45:41] God would be in debt. But God's not in
[1:45:42] debt to no money. It's a free gift of of
[1:45:45] grace. God doesn't owe us because we did
[1:45:47] good works. And so now he comes down to
[1:45:49] this that he made it by faith that it
[1:45:50] might be by grace to the to to the end.
[1:45:52] The promise might be sure that the
[1:45:54] reason this thrills my soul, friends, is
[1:45:56] because I do not have the capacity to
[1:45:59] always get it right.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I get it wrong. I fail. I make mistakes.
[1:46:03] I disappoint myself. I disappoint the
[1:46:05] Lord. I repent. I'm ashamed of things
[1:46:07] that I do. Amen. And if it were based on
[1:46:10] my conduct and my ability to have good
[1:46:12] conduct all the time, I would never have
[1:46:14] to faith to believe I'm part of the
[1:46:16] royal scene. But God didn't make it part
[1:46:18] of my conduct. He made it part of faith.
[1:46:20] And one thing that I can do, there's one
[1:46:22] thing that I do involuntarily I do when
[1:46:25] I can't help it. And that's believe this
[1:46:27] message.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it because I try to. I
[1:46:29] don't believe it cuz I strain to. I
[1:46:31] believe it because something inside of
[1:46:32] me jumps to its feet and begins to shout
[1:46:34] when I hear this message preached. in
[1:46:36] its fullness, in its power, and in his
[1:46:38] word. There's one thing that I can do. I
[1:46:40] can believe this message. I can believe
[1:46:42] what the prophet preached. There's
[1:46:43] nothing he preaches that bothers me.
[1:46:45] Amen. Things that I don't understand,
[1:46:47] they don't bother me. I can receive this
[1:46:49] word. And if I can receive this word,
[1:46:51] I've got token evidence that I'm part of
[1:46:53] the royal seed of Abraham because I've
[1:46:55] got the faith of Abraham.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; And that not of ourselves.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; It is the gift of God.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; What a joy it is. That's one thing I can
[1:47:06] do. I I can't live the best life. I
[1:47:08] can't perform the miracles. I can't show
[1:47:10] all the signs and wonders. I can't have
[1:47:12] all the gifts. But I can believe.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; By the impartation of a gift of grace.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Then he says in verse 17, "As it is
[1:47:21] written, I have made thee a father of
[1:47:22] many nations. before him who he had
[1:47:24] believed, even God, who quickenth the
[1:47:26] dead, and calleth those things which be
[1:47:28] not as though they were. Who against
[1:47:30] hope believed in hope, that he might
[1:47:32] become the father of many nations,
[1:47:34] according to that which was spoken, so
[1:47:36] shall thy seed be. And being not weak in
[1:47:38] faith, he considered not his own body
[1:47:40] now dead.
[1:47:42] He was too old to produce the promise. Y
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; being not weak in faith, he was weak in
[1:47:52] flesh,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; not weak in faith.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; This is how Abraham held on to the
[1:47:57] promise. This is how the royal seed
[1:47:59] holds on to the promise.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Being not weak in faith, he considered
[1:48:04] not his own body now dead when he was
[1:48:06] about 100 years old. Neither the
[1:48:08] deadness of Sarah's womb.
[1:48:11] He staggered not at the promise of God
[1:48:13] through unbelief, but was strong in
[1:48:15] faith, giving glory to God, and being
[1:48:17] fully persuaded that what he had
[1:48:19] promised, he was also he was able also
[1:48:24] to perform.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; That's what brother said. The royal seed
[1:48:27] of Abraham with like faith is Abraham's.
[1:48:30] This is the kind of faith the royal seed
[1:48:32] will have.
[1:48:34] If it takes 25 years, if it takes 50
[1:48:36] years, if it takes 150 years, we're not
[1:48:38] going to stagger at the promise of God.
[1:48:40] Though we become inable and incapable,
[1:48:42] and there's no seeming way reasonably
[1:48:45] that we can perform what the prophet
[1:48:46] said we would perform, it does not
[1:48:48] matter because I believe him faithful
[1:48:50] who made the promise.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Not me who's going to work it through,
[1:48:54] but he who made it is the one that I
[1:48:56] have faith in. Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; So he staggered not at the promise of
[1:48:59] God through unbelief but was strong in
[1:49:01] faith giving glory to God. This is how
[1:49:05] the bride moves.
[1:49:08] Let's continue on.
[1:49:10] Is everybody okay?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; We try to wrap up. The last day
[1:49:15] messenger will appear in God's appointed
[1:49:17] time.
[1:49:19] He did.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; This is history.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] The last day messenger will appear in
[1:49:27] God's appointed time. It is the end time
[1:49:29] now as all know for Israel is in the
[1:49:32] homeland. Any time now he will come
[1:49:34] according to Malachi. When we see him he
[1:49:38] will be dedicated to the word was he?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; He will be indicated
[1:49:45] pointed out in the word revelation 10:7
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; and we know Revelation 10:7. But in the
[1:49:50] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:49:51] this is indicating his ministry. When he
[1:49:55] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:49:57] should be finished, as he hath declared
[1:49:59] to his servants, the prophets.
[1:50:03] And God will vindicate his ministry.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Did he?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; So, was he dedicated to the word?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Was he indicated or pointed out in the
[1:50:17] word?
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And did God vindicate his ministry?
[1:50:22] This day this word is fulfilled. This
[1:50:25] prophecy
[1:50:27] he will preach the truth as did Elijah
[1:50:29] and be ready for the Mount Zion
[1:50:32] showdown.
[1:50:33] He says in the message I have heard but
[1:50:36] now I see. And when the true genuine
[1:50:37] vindication of the scriptures of this
[1:50:40] last day message and you see the
[1:50:41] presence of Jesus Christ that you had
[1:50:43] heard what he had done in his life and
[1:50:46] you hear the scriptures say he's the
[1:50:47] same yesterday, today and forever. And
[1:50:49] just before the Sodom condition is fired
[1:50:51] over with the wrath of God, see Jesus
[1:50:54] return amongst his people, formed in
[1:50:56] human flesh,
[1:50:58] who's he referring to
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; and do the same thing he done. My, it
[1:51:06] ought to strike our souls to glory. It
[1:51:08] ought to do something to us.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben refers to his ministry. He
[1:51:13] starts referring to the plains of memory
[1:51:14] when God came in human flesh and a
[1:51:17] tabernacle of flesh and with his back
[1:51:18] turned descent began to discern Sarah's
[1:51:20] heart and began to tell her what was
[1:51:22] wrong when he came at the time to
[1:51:24] confirm the promise to Abraham. And
[1:51:25] brother Bram starts showing that as a
[1:51:27] sign he even physically demonstrates on
[1:51:29] the platform by turning us back to
[1:51:31] people and doing the exact same thing so
[1:51:33] that we would see this Jesus Christ the
[1:51:35] same yesterday, today, forever. The sign
[1:51:37] of the Messiah on earth again. What is
[1:51:39] it? It's God vindicating his voice,
[1:51:42] vindicating his word. Now the spoken
[1:51:44] word is the original seed. Come back to
[1:51:46] the original so that it can reproduce
[1:51:48] itself.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Reproduce itself where? Reproduce itself
[1:51:52] in us.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, God wasn't wasting all
[1:51:58] that time vindicating Brother Ben to
[1:52:00] say, "Brother Bam's a mighty man. He's
[1:52:01] the greatest thing on earth and it's all
[1:52:03] in him." He vindicated him so that we
[1:52:05] would listen to him. So that when we
[1:52:06] listen to him that we would open our
[1:52:08] hearts to receive the true word. And
[1:52:09] when we receive the true word, the true
[1:52:11] word would come and be anointed by the
[1:52:13] spirit to manifest itself so that we
[1:52:15] would become the very pre the
[1:52:17] manifestation of the preaching of the
[1:52:19] message is Christ in bride form. Amen.
[1:52:23] God didn't vindicate him for him. God
[1:52:25] vindicating for you so that you would
[1:52:27] open the ears of your heart to listen to
[1:52:29] this message and receive it so that this
[1:52:31] message which is Christ can come into
[1:52:34] you and manifest itself again on the
[1:52:36] earth.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed so
[1:52:39] it can bring back the original life.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; What is the attraction on the mountain?
[1:52:45] I heard a voice said he's talking about
[1:52:47] being a Sabinu Canyon when the sword
[1:52:49] come into his hand. He said that's the
[1:52:50] king's sword. I said a king knights a
[1:52:52] man with a sword. He the voice came back
[1:52:55] said not a king's sword but the king's
[1:52:58] sword and the word of the Lord said fear
[1:53:01] not it's only the third pull it's the
[1:53:05] vindication of your ministry what was
[1:53:08] the vindication of his ministry mean the
[1:53:10] vindication of the ministry was God put
[1:53:12] the word in his hand because he's the
[1:53:14] last prophet to the Gentiles to restore
[1:53:16] the full measure and full interpretation
[1:53:19] and revelation of the word that's the
[1:53:21] vindication of his ministry Listen, it
[1:53:23] wasn't all the healings and signs and
[1:53:25] wonders. Those were a vindication to
[1:53:27] vindicate him a prophet. But what
[1:53:28] vindicated him as the seventh angel is
[1:53:31] when he put the word in his hand and
[1:53:33] used him to deliver the word.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; What word? The unwritten word. The
[1:53:38] interpretation of the thunders, the
[1:53:40] white rock within the rock, the mystery
[1:53:42] of God now being revealed. That's the
[1:53:44] vindication of his ministry.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; And he held fast to it.
[1:53:51] He says in the rising of the sun. Well,
[1:53:53] if you turn the picture like this, we
[1:53:56] know the cloud picture. We seen the
[1:53:57] cloud picture.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; You turn the picture like this and look,
[1:54:00] you can probably see it from the
[1:54:01] audience. It's Christ.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; See his eyes? Look here. Just as perfect
[1:54:06] as it could be wearing the white wig of
[1:54:08] supreme deity and judge of all heavens
[1:54:10] and earth. Can you see his eyes, nose,
[1:54:12] mouth? Just turn the picture from this
[1:54:14] the way they had it. This way they had
[1:54:16] it in pyramid form. the way it's
[1:54:18] supposed to be
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; to the right.
[1:54:22] Can you see it? He is supreme judge.
[1:54:25] There is none other but him. And that is
[1:54:28] a perfect identification again a
[1:54:31] vindication that this message is the
[1:54:34] truth.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; This is the truth. It is true in making
[1:54:39] him not a third person but the only
[1:54:41] person.
[1:54:44] That cloud, brother couldn't put that
[1:54:47] cloud there.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; No man could put that cloud there.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; God put it there.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; And everybody in the world was looking
[1:54:56] at it wrong until God came to a prophet
[1:54:57] and said, "Look at it right."
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Turned it to the right. And there he saw
[1:55:01] the face of Christ. It was the headship
[1:55:03] of the word returning to unite with the
[1:55:05] body to bring the invisible union to
[1:55:07] what? To impregnate a people on this
[1:55:09] earth with the original word. So that
[1:55:11] original word would reproduce himself in
[1:55:13] what? To reproduce Jesus Christ, the
[1:55:16] fullness of the word on earth again.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Where? In you and me, friends.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; It's been the whole point of the whole
[1:55:24] message.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; And God vindicated it. He proved it and
[1:55:28] he backed it up.
[1:55:32] Let's continue on.
[1:55:35] says in paragraph 176-3, "Many will
[1:55:38] understand him because they have been
[1:55:39] taught scripture in a certain way which
[1:55:42] they consider truth." Not that they're
[1:55:44] taught it true, but it's been considered
[1:55:47] truth
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; because trinity is considered truth.
[1:55:50] Baptism and title is considered truth.
[1:55:52] All that's considered truth.
[1:55:54] When he comes against that, they will
[1:55:57] not believe. So the question is what's
[1:55:59] that?
[1:56:00] this when he comes against that the
[1:56:04] teaching of scripture a certain way that
[1:56:06] they consider truth
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; right
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; the doctrines of the denominations when
[1:56:11] he comes against that they will not
[1:56:13] believe even some true ministers will
[1:56:16] misunderstand the messenger because so
[1:56:18] much has been called God's truth by
[1:56:20] deceivers
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; amen let's go to our last paragraph now
[1:56:26] 176-4 on page 10 but this prophet will
[1:56:30] come. And as the forerunner to the first
[1:56:33] come crying, behold the lamb of God that
[1:56:35] taketh away the sin of the world, even
[1:56:38] so will he not will he no doubt cry out,
[1:56:41] "Behold the lamb of God coming in
[1:56:44] glory." He will do this. For even as
[1:56:47] John was the messenger of truth to the
[1:56:49] elect, so is this one the last messenger
[1:56:52] to the elect and word born bride. This
[1:56:56] is how brother Brandham uh words this.
[1:56:58] I've got the words up here on the
[1:57:00] overhead. This last paragraph, I brought
[1:57:01] it up.
[1:57:03] He says, "But he says, "But this prophet
[1:57:06] will come." He's referring to his own
[1:57:08] ministry, the Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7
[1:57:10] ministry.
[1:57:12] And as the first forerunner, John the
[1:57:13] Baptist cried, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:57:15] to take away the sin of the world." He's
[1:57:17] not going to repeat that statement
[1:57:19] because that's already happened.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; But he's yet forerunning.
[1:57:24] His message is forerunning a second
[1:57:26] coming.
[1:57:28] But he will no doubt cry out, "Behold
[1:57:30] the lamb of God." Sorry,
[1:57:34] I don't like putting a line through
[1:57:35] that. That hurts my feelings.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God coming in glory.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; that's his cry. Behold the lamb of God
[1:57:45] coming in glory.
[1:57:48] It's interesting that brother Brandham
[1:57:53] Well, I I'm going to look at two
[1:57:55] different statements. when he preaches
[1:57:57] this in spoken word the original se when
[1:57:59] he first talks about pick up your pen
[1:58:00] and write in the message from the Holy
[1:58:02] Spirit he words this differently and
[1:58:04] we're going to go look at how he worded
[1:58:05] it there versus how he worded it here
[1:58:08] but in between I want to go to this
[1:58:10] scripture in the breach so we're all
[1:58:12] tied together said at the sounding of
[1:58:14] the seven church age the last church age
[1:58:17] all the loose ends that through these
[1:58:18] church ages have been probed at will be
[1:58:21] wound up together and when the seals are
[1:58:23] broke and the mystery is revealed down
[1:58:25] comes is the angel, the messenger Christ
[1:58:30] who comes at the opening of the seals.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Christ sending his foot upon the land
[1:58:35] and upon the sea with a rainbow over his
[1:58:37] head. Now remember this seventh angel is
[1:58:40] on earth at the time of this coming.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; So our Elijah is on earth at the time of
[1:58:45] this coming when Christ returns to his
[1:58:47] bride.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; And he said that he will be crying out
[1:58:51] behold the lamb of God coming in glory.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:56] Amen.
[1:58:57] I don't remember and you might remember
[1:58:59] but I don't remember any specific time
[1:59:01] brother Brandham was in the pullpit
[1:59:03] preaching and under inspiration cried
[1:59:05] out behold the lamb of God coming in
[1:59:08] glory. So saying he'll say that doesn't
[1:59:11] mean he's going to shout that phrase one
[1:59:13] time like John the Baptist did on the
[1:59:15] banks of Jordan. But he is certainly
[1:59:18] going to be shouting out and declaring
[1:59:20] the lamb of God coming in glory.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he's coming at the time
[1:59:26] the seventh angel is on earth. So, he's
[1:59:28] going to be making this declaration in
[1:59:30] his ministry.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; We're on the same page.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; And if you find something different than
[1:59:35] that, let me know. But I I don't know of
[1:59:37] it. And so, this is spoken words, the
[1:59:40] original seed. This is where brother
[1:59:41] Benham talks about for the first time
[1:59:44] this experience of pick up your pen and
[1:59:46] write. And this is the last paragraph
[1:59:48] what we just read out of the Peramian
[1:59:49] church age church age book. This is the
[1:59:51] way he says it. And the end time
[1:59:53] prophecies will repeat. I believe as the
[1:59:56] first forerunner came with the from the
[1:59:58] wilderness and cried, "Behold the lamb
[2:00:00] of God." The second forerunner will
[2:00:02] probably do the same by pointing the
[2:00:04] people to a word bride.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Doing the same thing as saying, "Behold
[2:00:14] the lamb of God that
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; so crying out, this is him.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; This is his coming. Here he is. He'll
[2:00:23] probably do the same thing by pointing
[2:00:25] the people to a word born bride because
[2:00:28] that's the coming.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's where he came to. He came to the
[2:00:32] word born bride as the headship to the
[2:00:35] body and invisible union to unite
[2:00:37] together. It's the bride coming of
[2:00:39] Christ.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Then he said the bride of Christ will be
[2:00:44] pointed to the skies at the peering of
[2:00:47] Jesus screaming behold the lamb of God
[2:00:49] will come forth from his lips. God, help
[2:00:51] us to be ready for this near event. My
[2:00:53] goodness. A Amen. He He did that in the
[2:00:56] last quote we read where he took the
[2:00:58] picture and turned it and see that's our
[2:00:59] L. He said that's our Lord up there.
[2:01:01] That's Christ coming. Amen. She's been
[2:01:04] pointed to the skies as he's saying it's
[2:01:06] him. It's the supreme judge. It's the
[2:01:08] Lord of all heavens and earth. Amen.
[2:01:10] He's come to unite with his bride. Amen.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; So,
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; this is this is just what I want to say
[2:01:19] to you as we go off the air this
[2:01:22] morning.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham words this two
[2:01:28] different ways.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; But the question is, does he mean two
[2:01:33] different things?
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I don't think so.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I don't think so. Here he says he'll say
[2:01:42] he'll no doubt cry behold the lamb of
[2:01:44] God coming in glory
[2:01:47] and in spoken word he says the second
[2:01:50] forerunner will probably do the same by
[2:01:51] pointing the people to a wordorn bride
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; crying out this is him
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; how's he doing it by pointing the people
[2:02:00] to a wordborn bride because as she
[2:02:03] receives the word she becomes the word
[2:02:05] and she will be so much like him she
[2:02:08] will be him.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 11:7,
[2:02:16] "For a man indeed ought not to cover his
[2:02:18] head, for as much as he is the image and
[2:02:19] glory of God." That's Jesus Christ. But
[2:02:23] the woman is the glory of the man.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Behold, he cometh in glory.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; What is his glory? The fact that he
[2:02:32] could redeem a fallen woman. The fact
[2:02:33] that his blood was enough. The fact that
[2:02:35] he could bring back the word. The fact
[2:02:37] that he could restore what Satan had
[2:02:39] ruined, that he could bring back the
[2:02:40] masterpiece. That's his glory, friends.
[2:02:42] And that makes you his glory. Not
[2:02:44] because you have glory. But it's his
[2:02:46] glory to redeem you. It's his glory to
[2:02:49] take a fallen creature lost in the
[2:02:51] depths of darkness at the end of seven
[2:02:53] church ages that separated us from the
[2:02:55] truth of God and to restore it all back.
[2:02:57] Amen. With signs and wonders and power
[2:02:59] and manifestation and vindication. That
[2:03:02] is his glory, not our glory. And when
[2:03:04] his glory rest upon us, it becomes his
[2:03:07] glory. And then did this this final
[2:03:10] messenger will say, "Behold the lamb
[2:03:12] coming in glory." But then he says the
[2:03:14] spoken word's original seed, he'll do
[2:03:16] this by pointing to a word born bride
[2:03:19] because she's reflecting the glory of
[2:03:21] the Lord.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz she can't do it herself. She can't
[2:03:25] do it with her power. She's powerless to
[2:03:28] do it. But he's done it himself in this
[2:03:30] generation. He came himself. We couldn't
[2:03:33] make him come. We couldn't force him to
[2:03:35] come. But he did. The fullness of the
[2:03:37] Holy Ghost back in the church, the full
[2:03:39] word with the full life to manifest the
[2:03:41] word is here
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; to show his glory.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; That's why a woman needs to stay under
[2:03:50] headship
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; because she's the glory of the man.
[2:03:54] That's why she's not to cut her hair
[2:03:56] because her hair is a symbol of
[2:03:57] authority. She's under the authority of
[2:03:59] her husband. That's why this bride is
[2:04:01] not to trim the word. She's not to
[2:04:03] separate her power. She's to stay under
[2:04:05] headship. Because when she stays under
[2:04:07] headship, her goal is to be the glory of
[2:04:09] the man. And that man is the man Christ
[2:04:11] Jesus who is the man.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Not a man. The man.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; That's what Pilate said when he looked
[2:04:18] at him standing there. Amen. Beaten and
[2:04:20] abused and standing there absorbing the
[2:04:23] sins of the whole world and the wrath of
[2:04:24] God upon him. Amen. To take it. And he
[2:04:26] looked at him and he didn't say, "Behold
[2:04:28] this man." or look at this man. He said,
[2:04:30] "Behold the man." Because there was only
[2:04:32] one man that could take back what man
[2:04:34] lost. There was only one man that could
[2:04:36] redeem man. There was only one that
[2:04:38] could fit the kinsman redeemer. And he
[2:04:41] and Pilate, the authority in that region
[2:04:43] in that day, stands up and he declares
[2:04:45] to them all because God makes him
[2:04:47] declare the truth. And he looks at him
[2:04:49] and says, "Behold the man." Amen.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; And now the woman which is a type of the
[2:04:56] church, the bride is the glory
[2:05:00] of the man.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[2:05:06] Notice the vindicated word in his body
[2:05:10] is his very victory and the reason of
[2:05:15] his death.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; let's read that. The vindicated word in
[2:05:21] his body is his his very victory.
[2:05:26] What was God trying to do? What was
[2:05:28] Jesus Christ trying to do? He was trying
[2:05:30] to get you back to sons and daughters of
[2:05:32] God so he can reunite you with you. So
[2:05:34] he could go back to the original purpose
[2:05:36] and the original thought of God's mind
[2:05:38] because God wants to be manifest in
[2:05:40] flesh as a family of sons and daughters
[2:05:42] of God and fellowship together. And it
[2:05:44] took a redemption to bring us back. But
[2:05:46] at the end of this redemption cycle,
[2:05:48] he's going to show it in his glory, his
[2:05:50] power. There's going to be a spotless,
[2:05:52] virtuous bride that's standing upon the
[2:05:54] word with no more deception, no more
[2:05:56] deceiving because he's here to carry her
[2:05:58] through.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; See the death, not in the spirit. When
[2:06:03] he died, he only died in the flesh. His
[2:06:06] spirit went to hell and preached to
[2:06:07] souls in prison. That's right. His flesh
[2:06:09] only died when he raised it up again and
[2:06:12] quickened it. Quicken means made alive.
[2:06:14] his flesh,
[2:06:16] which is his body.
[2:06:19] Catch this. He's switching now. He's not
[2:06:22] going to talk about the body that was
[2:06:25] nailed to the cross anymore.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Now he's talking about his body that's
[2:06:28] on earth now.
[2:06:31] His flesh, which is his body.
[2:06:34] And that's the word.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; What was Jesus Christ? The word made
[2:06:42] flesh. Amen.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; His body, and that's the word, has been
[2:06:50] laying dead for years,
[2:06:53] but it gradually began to come in the
[2:06:56] reformation. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are we
[2:07:01] talking about? His body, which is the
[2:07:05] word,
[2:07:07] has been dead for years,
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; but it's gradually beginning to come.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; And
[2:07:16] begin to come in the reformation.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; And now she
[2:07:25] is standing upon her feet.
[2:07:30] his body.
[2:07:34] She
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; can you read it any other way, friends?
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. His flesh, which is his body and
[2:07:44] that's the word. It's been laying dead.
[2:07:47] What? His body. But gradually begin to
[2:07:49] come to reformation. What? His body,
[2:07:51] which is the word. And now she is
[2:07:54] standing on her feet.
[2:08:00] Amen.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's friends, that's his glory
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; and his victory and the purpose of his
[2:08:05] death.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish I had time to go back
[2:08:09] into Ezekiel. What? Now, where does he
[2:08:12] want to go? He does all this and now he
[2:08:13] wants to go to Ezekiel and pull out them
[2:08:16] dry bones and show you. He said, "Can
[2:08:17] these bones live again?" He said,
[2:08:19] "Prophesy." Said, "How can prophecy
[2:08:21] come?" Only through the prophet.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; It's the word of the Lord. Hear ye dry
[2:08:26] bones. The word of the Lord and Senu's
[2:08:29] skin came upon them and they stood up a
[2:08:30] mighty army and began to march toward
[2:08:32] Zion. Glory to God. Listen. Glory to
[2:08:36] God. Oh, praise God. That's him. That's
[2:08:40] him. The victory.
[2:08:43] What's him? Can these dry bones live?
[2:08:45] What dry bones? It's the army of the
[2:08:48] Lord. It's the church that went down
[2:08:50] through four stages of the insect that
[2:08:52] ate it down to nothing but began to come
[2:08:55] back through three stages. Sin you
[2:08:57] listen he brother Bam breaks this all
[2:08:59] down in the message he comes back in
[2:09:01] these dry just sin you came bone came to
[2:09:03] bone sin you came skin come came upon it
[2:09:05] and it's standing back a mighty army and
[2:09:08] he says then he calls for the wind to
[2:09:10] come which is what is the wind is the
[2:09:12] original life the breath of God the Holy
[2:09:15] Ghost amen in the latter rain and the
[2:09:18] and the third pull amen the Holy Ghost
[2:09:20] came back into this body his body his
[2:09:23] bride body to bring him back to life And
[2:09:26] then what does he say? Then she's
[2:09:28] marching on to Zion. Oh, praise God.
[2:09:31] What is Zion? It's the bride. What
[2:09:33] happened somewhere along the line? This
[2:09:36] But this this army never made it all the
[2:09:39] way to Zion to the marriage of the lamb.
[2:09:42] But praise God, there's going to be a
[2:09:43] restoration. Not a new army, but a
[2:09:46] restoration of the original army, which
[2:09:48] was the church that came out of
[2:09:49] Pentecost.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And he's going to bring it back. He
[2:09:52] says, "Prophesy." How are you going to
[2:09:54] prophesy? only through a prophet. It's
[2:09:57] only a prophet that can bring this body
[2:10:00] of the bride back to life. The army of
[2:10:03] the Lord. And what's this army going to
[2:10:04] do when it comes to life? Finish the
[2:10:07] journey. The first age didn't finish.
[2:10:09] She's going all the way to Zion. She's
[2:10:11] going to enter into Bula land. She's
[2:10:13] going to be married to the lamb.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about,
[2:10:19] friends.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; That's what this ministry is about.
[2:10:21] That's what the vindication is about.
[2:10:23] That's why you're here. And that's why
[2:10:25] your soul is jumping and a shouting and
[2:10:27] a stirring because this is you. This
[2:10:29] isn't a doctrine. This is you. This
[2:10:31] isn't a teaching. This is you. This is
[2:10:33] the purpose you were born for. This is
[2:10:35] the attribute that's inside of you that
[2:10:37] was back in God's mind when he was alone
[2:10:39] with his attributes thinking of himself
[2:10:41] becoming flesh. That's what's inside of
[2:10:43] you. Can't contain itself anymore
[2:10:45] because it's him coming to the
[2:10:47] manifestation of this prophecy.
[2:10:51] And he's coming in his glory. He's
[2:10:54] taking what was defiled, what was
[2:10:56] broken, what was cast down, and what was
[2:10:58] utterly useless, and by his blood, and
[2:11:01] by his spirit, and by his work, he's
[2:11:03] restoring the masterpiece again. And it
[2:11:06] glorifies him,
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; not her.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Him,
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; because the woman is the glory of the
[2:11:14] man.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; That's why we've got to be under hesit.
[2:11:18] That's why we don't take denomination.
[2:11:19] That's why we don't seek sign. That's
[2:11:21] why the only thing for us is the
[2:11:22] original word. Amen.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; To be pregnant by the word, to manifest
[2:11:26] the word, to become the word.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; That's the whole point.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Skin came upon them. They stood up a
[2:11:34] mighty army and begin to march towards
[2:11:36] Zion. Glory to God. That's him.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; She will be
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; him. Amen.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; His victory, his glory.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; The evidence of his power.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Let's look at this scripture. Isaiah 60.
[2:12:00] Arise,
[2:12:02] shine, for thy light has come.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham preaches this scripture
[2:12:09] in shalom. Good morning. It is the
[2:12:12] rising of the sun.
[2:12:14] Arise, shine, for thy light has come,
[2:12:17] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:12:20] thee.
[2:12:22] For behold, the darkness shall cover the
[2:12:24] earth and gross darkness the people, but
[2:12:27] the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his
[2:12:30] glory,
[2:12:32] his glory,
[2:12:35] his glory
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; shall be seen upon thee.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the prophet would point
[2:12:41] to a wordborn bride because the word did
[2:12:44] the purging. The word did the cleaning.
[2:12:46] The word did the restoring. And she's
[2:12:48] become the word.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; He's the word. She's the word. She's
[2:12:54] reflecting him.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God, friends.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; I would rather have this than anything
[2:13:04] this man in our world can afford. Amen.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; I'd rather have this truth bubbling over
[2:13:09] in my soul. I'd rather have it than any
[2:13:12] pleasure you can give me. Any any any
[2:13:14] position, any any comforts, any ease.
[2:13:17] I'd rather have this than have anything
[2:13:19] because this is more than life to me.
[2:13:21] This is an attachment that goes beyond
[2:13:23] any other attachment that I have in this
[2:13:25] planet. This is something that goes back
[2:13:26] into the eternities that I hold with me.
[2:13:29] Amen. It's a token evidence to me. It
[2:13:31] may not be to you, but it is to me. And
[2:13:32] it's alive inside of me, and it's real
[2:13:34] inside of me. And it's power inside of
[2:13:36] me.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; This revelation is what one makes me
[2:13:40] love him. This this revelation that
[2:13:42] makes me serve him. It's this revelation
[2:13:43] that keeps me repenting and coming back
[2:13:45] again and again and again because it's
[2:13:47] not about me. It's about him. It's not
[2:13:49] what I can do. It's what he can do. It's
[2:13:50] about him wanting to use me to fulfill
[2:13:53] his purpose and show his glory.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; May I keep my hair uncut.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; No trimming the word. No, no touching
[2:14:05] it. May I leave it uncut
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; under headship with a sign of power, his
[2:14:11] power, his authority, his word. And that
[2:14:13] sign be upon me as I humbly submit to
[2:14:15] him. What was Jesus Christ? He was the
[2:14:18] perfect son. God had tried out sons
[2:14:21] before. He had Adam, he failed. He had
[2:14:22] Noah, he failed. He had Moses, he
[2:14:24] failed. He had David, he failed. He had
[2:14:25] Solomon, he failed. They were all sons
[2:14:27] of God, and they all failed. But here
[2:14:28] come one that didn't fail because he was
[2:14:31] the perfect lamb of God. He was God made
[2:14:33] flesh and God came down and became his
[2:14:35] own son so that he could be a son that
[2:14:37] wouldn't fail.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; But to restore the masterpiece, he can't
[2:14:42] leave him alone because it's not good
[2:14:44] that man shall be alone. He's got to
[2:14:45] make a help me for him. So, amen. As the
[2:14:47] as the church came, as they pierced his
[2:14:49] side, out came the ingredients for the
[2:14:51] church. And she was to be a help me. But
[2:14:53] as she moved through the journey, she
[2:14:54] began to fall away and she began to trim
[2:14:56] her hair. She began to come out from
[2:14:58] under headship and she could no longer
[2:14:59] be his glory.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. She came a dishonorable woman,
[2:15:04] but he's going to have a bride without
[2:15:07] spot or wrinkle. He's going to come back
[2:15:09] because he said he would because it's
[2:15:11] it's his name on the line. It's his
[2:15:14] credibility. It's his promise. It's his
[2:15:16] word. It's him. He's got to do it cuz he
[2:15:19] said he would do it. And he will do it,
[2:15:21] friends. He's going to have a bride
[2:15:22] without spot or wrinkle. And he's going
[2:15:23] to bring her to that position by the
[2:15:25] restoration of the original spoken word.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Because it's the original seed. And when
[2:15:31] the original word comes back into a a a
[2:15:34] predestinated womb, a virgin womb that's
[2:15:36] been purified by the word, what will
[2:15:38] that do? It'll reproduce Christ again,
[2:15:40] the anointed word for our day.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; And it'll be his glory, his power, his
[2:15:47] life, his work made manifest in her.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; I'll say again, if they lock the doors
[2:15:54] and they prevent us from preaching,
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; then friends, we're there.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] That's the whole point of what are we
[2:16:03] preaching for to have church?
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; No. To manifest this life.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; What are you coming together to create a
[2:16:09] program? No.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; To become this word
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; is the point of everything we do and all
[2:16:16] of our efforts and all of our comingings
[2:16:18] and all of our goings and everything
[2:16:20] we're trying to accomplish is to
[2:16:23] surrender to this word and give him
[2:16:25] preeminence so that he can finish the
[2:16:27] work.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. so that his glory can be seen upon
[2:16:31] us.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, it makes me want to surrender. It
[2:16:35] makes me want to submit. It makes me
[2:16:37] want to lose my life. It makes me want
[2:16:40] to give to my husband because there's
[2:16:42] going to be Listen, just like there was
[2:16:44] many sons, there was many brides.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; And they all failed.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Eve failed,
[2:16:51] Sarah failed, first church failed, every
[2:16:55] Rebecca failed. day off. Every bride
[2:16:57] type failed, but he's going to have one
[2:17:00] that's not fail going to fall because
[2:17:01] she's predestinated not to.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; And what's going to keep her from
[2:17:05] falling? Good deeds, good works, getting
[2:17:07] being nice always. No, she's going to
[2:17:09] stay with the word and only the word and
[2:17:11] nothing but the word. And she's going to
[2:17:12] stick with the original seed.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; So she can produce the original life.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, God be praised.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. the musicians,
[2:17:24] if you'll come.
[2:17:26] I just got to stop.
[2:17:29] Oh, isn't he so wonderful, friends?
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; What a message from the Holy Spirit to
[2:17:35] the church.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; What what a glorious thing God has done
[2:17:41] this day. This prophecy is fulfilled in
[2:17:44] your eyes.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; And now he's fulfilling the rest of it,
[2:17:48] friends.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; He's fulfilling the rest of it. And
[2:17:51] what's the rest of it?
[2:17:54] Arise, shine, thy light has come.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; May the glory of the Lord be seen upon
[2:18:02] thee.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; I got one more scripture. I wasn't going
[2:18:06] to go here, but can I read one more?
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 30 26. Moreover, the light of the
[2:18:14] moon. Do you know that's the reflective
[2:18:16] light of Christ? That's the type of the
[2:18:17] church.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moreover, the light of the moon
[2:18:20] shall be as the light of the sun. That
[2:18:23] means she's going to give a perfect
[2:18:24] reflection of him.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; There's going to come a time the light
[2:18:28] of the moon shall be of the sun and the
[2:18:30] light of the sun shall be sevenfold as
[2:18:32] the light of seven church ages
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; fullness, truth,
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; finishing of the masterpiece.
[2:18:42] In the day that the Lord bindeth up the
[2:18:44] breach of his people and health the
[2:18:46] stroke of their wound.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; What is our wound? Hybridization. What
[2:18:51] is the stroke? The the fall in the
[2:18:53] garden. And this is the day he's going
[2:18:55] to bind it up. And in that day, the moon
[2:18:58] is going to reflect the same light as
[2:19:00] the sun, but the sun is going to be
[2:19:01] shining a sevenfold light. The full
[2:19:04] seven seals, the truth and mystery of
[2:19:05] God, all revealed and brought back to
[2:19:07] full illumination. And now reflected in
[2:19:10] the moon. Amen.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, may his glory be seen in us,
[2:19:17] friends,
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; as we surrendered to him. Let's just bow
[2:19:20] our heads together.
[2:19:22] Oh, heavenly father, we thank you, Lord
[2:19:24] Jesus, for your goodness, for your
[2:19:26] mercy, Lord. God, we don't even know
[2:19:29] what to say. We don't even know how to
[2:19:30] say thanks. It's beyond thanks. It's
[2:19:32] beyond the language. It's beyond words.
[2:19:34] It's beyond anything we can do. We can
[2:19:36] weep for hours, Lord. We We can say
[2:19:38] thank you a thousand times. It wouldn't
[2:19:40] even touch the gratitude that's in our
[2:19:42] soul.
[2:19:43] God, what can we do, Lord, to touch the
[2:19:46] the enthusiasm, the excitement, the
[2:19:48] gratitude, the humility, the the what a
[2:19:51] the overwhelming feeling of awe that we
[2:19:53] have, Lord, at looking into your word.
[2:19:56] There's no words that can do it, but oh
[2:19:58] God, just take us. Take our lives more
[2:20:01] than our words. Take our hearts. Take
[2:20:03] our souls. Take our lives.
[2:20:06] God, let your glory be seen upon us.
[2:20:10] God, help me, Lord Jesus, to surrender
[2:20:13] more than I've ever surrendered before.
[2:20:16] Help me to lay down my life, Lord. Help
[2:20:18] me to surrender to you and let you do
[2:20:20] your work in me.
[2:20:23] God, give us the courage, the wisdom,
[2:20:26] the anointing by your Holy Spirit to
[2:20:29] stay with your original spoken word
[2:20:32] because that original spoken word will
[2:20:34] reproduce itself.
[2:20:37] Help us not to be chasers of men and
[2:20:40] chasers of programs, chasers of
[2:20:42] churches, chasers of signs,
[2:20:45] but help us to be seekers of your word,
[2:20:48] chasers after you, after your word, your
[2:20:52] truth. May that become our all and all.
[2:20:55] May we be willing to give everything up
[2:20:56] for that.
[2:20:59] God, sustain us by your word. Grow us by
[2:21:01] your word. Perfect us, Lord, by your
[2:21:03] word. And may you take the preeminence
[2:21:06] in us for that's your great goal for
[2:21:08] this hour is to have a people that you
[2:21:10] have preeminence in. Lord, we just want
[2:21:13] to surrender fresh to you all over
[2:21:15] again. And not just surrender, Lord. I
[2:21:18] want to repent.
[2:21:20] I repent for allowing this world to
[2:21:22] entice me, to distract me, to tantalize
[2:21:26] me, to frustrate me, to discourage me.
[2:21:30] God, help me to get my eyes off the
[2:21:32] world and back on your word.
[2:21:35] Help me, Lord, to continually to focus
[2:21:37] my attention on my headship, my husband,
[2:21:40] the revealed word, my bridegroom.
[2:21:43] For there I have joy. There I have
[2:21:45] peace. There I have contentment. There I
[2:21:47] have rest.
[2:21:49] God, there I find my purpose.
[2:21:52] God, I pray you'd help me to continually
[2:21:56] stay devoted to you, Lord. Stay centered
[2:21:59] on your word, to be feeding on it
[2:22:01] constantly, to be surrendering to it and
[2:22:03] giving you room to work. Not just me,
[2:22:06] but everyone in the sound of my voice.
[2:22:07] May you do the same for them. They have
[2:22:09] the same desire I have. God, forgive us
[2:22:12] for wasting time. Forgive us for wasting
[2:22:15] the precious days and months and years
[2:22:17] you give us. For God, we know what your
[2:22:20] purpose is and what you're trying to do.
[2:22:23] And as you commanded a widow woman to
[2:22:25] sustain Elijah, you've commanded us to
[2:22:27] manifest this word.
[2:22:29] God, just every encounter we have, every
[2:22:33] opportunity,
[2:22:34] may you just work in us. Even if we
[2:22:37] don't understand what's happening at the
[2:22:39] time, may we just surrender and allow
[2:22:41] you to work your great plan in our
[2:22:43] lives. And may your word become
[2:22:46] everything to us. We love you. We commit
[2:22:50] ourselves. We commit our life. We commit
[2:22:52] the service. We commit the people all
[2:22:54] into your hand. And we have joy and
[2:22:57] faith and trust that this little bride
[2:23:01] won't be deceived. She won't be derailed
[2:23:04] because you predestinated for it not to
[2:23:06] happen. You will have it, Lord. And our
[2:23:09] faith is there. And God, may we yield to
[2:23:12] that and surrender to that. We love you.
[2:23:15] We thank you. Keep your people. Watch
[2:23:16] over them. Protect them. Bless them. And
[2:23:19] help us all grow in this revelation. We
[2:23:22] ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:23:26] Amen. God bless you. God's attributes
[2:23:30] were manifested to his bride in this
[2:23:34] last age. We have caught the revelation
[2:23:38] by the last prophets's message. And we
[2:23:41] know who we are and what we're raised up
[2:23:46] for. Praise the Lord.

[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:36] Well, it's burning now within my heart.

[2:28:48] Amen. Sister Anna came forward and said
[2:28:51] that God has given her a testimony and a
[2:28:53] song and she just has it burning on her
[2:28:56] heart to sing that song. So, we're going
[2:28:57] to give her this
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. blue microphone. Whoever's up
[2:29:00] there, we're going to give her the
[2:29:02] microphone and let her sing that song.
[2:29:04] So, God bless you. You can be seated for
[2:29:05] just a moment. She's gonna stand right
[2:29:07] here and sing it.
[2:29:10] God bless you, sister.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; I Everybody could have stayed standed,
[2:29:17] but or standing, but I just
[2:29:20] I don't really even know what to say
[2:29:22] after service like this. It's It's like
[2:29:24] being in heavenly places walking through
[2:29:26] Bible times again. And I wish we could
[2:29:29] just understand more clearly what we're
[2:29:31] actually a part of, but it's happening.
[2:29:35] And and it's been a year since we've
[2:29:38] been able to be here. And we stream
[2:29:39] every service. And you you've been such
[2:29:42] a strength to us. It's it's been a
[2:29:44] lifeline. And the word just keeps
[2:29:47] pulling us through everything. We've had
[2:29:48] some personal tragedy this past year. We
[2:29:50] lost a son. We lost my husband lost his
[2:29:54] father. And Satan's
[2:29:56] been hitting us pretty hard mentally.
[2:29:59] You know, you he shakes you to your very
[2:30:01] core. And
[2:30:04] when you're there, all you can say is,
[2:30:06] "Lord, I know I believe. And Lord,
[2:30:10] though you slay me, still I'll trust
[2:30:12] you." And over and over through this
[2:30:14] past year is confusions come and doubts
[2:30:16] come. And this feels like you're walking
[2:30:17] a razor's edge all the time. And the
[2:30:21] term that just keeps coming back to me
[2:30:22] through the ministry, through brother
[2:30:24] Brandham, through song is just this,
[2:30:27] stay with my word. Stay with my word.
[2:30:30] And he gave me a little song that's just
[2:30:32] encouraged me. You know, you go through
[2:30:33] mental battles and when you start
[2:30:34] singing the word, the devil has to
[2:30:37] leave. So, I just want to It's real
[2:30:40] short. I don't know if there will be
[2:30:42] other verses later, but this is I hope
[2:30:44] it can encourage someone.
[2:30:49] Stay with my word, child.
[2:30:54] Stay with my word.
[2:30:57] Stay with that certain sound
[2:31:02] that you have heard.
[2:31:06] Don't look to the right or left. Keep
[2:31:10] your mind stayed on me.
[2:31:15] I'll lead you all the way
[2:31:20] back to eternity.
[2:31:22] [Music]
[2:31:24] Be separate unto me.
[2:31:28] Touch not the unclean thing.
[2:31:32] I provided all you need.
[2:31:37] In me you are complete.
[2:31:41] I'll take you by the hand
[2:31:45] and lead you from this land.
[2:31:50] Just keep your eyes on me and stay with
[2:31:55] my word.
[2:31:58] Stay with my word, child.
[2:32:02] Stay with my word.
[2:32:05] Stay with a certain sound
[2:32:10] that you have heard.
[2:32:13] Don't look to the right or left. Keep
[2:32:17] your mind stayed on me.
[2:32:21] And I'll lead you all the way
[2:32:26] back to eternity.
[2:32:31] God bless you.
[2:32:42] Amen. Maybe one of our song leaders can
[2:32:44] make that a congregational
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand again.
[2:32:49] Thank you, Sister Anna. That was
[2:32:51] wonderful. What a capping to the word.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; Let's just stay with it
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; and trust him.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Doesn't have to be complicated. It can
[2:33:00] be simple. Yeah,
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; just stay in submission to the headship
[2:33:03] of the word. Feed on it. Just love him.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Why does this have to
[2:33:10] come in this day? So that the bride will
[2:33:14] know her bridegroom, the revealed word."
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; So what is the word? It's Christ. What
[2:33:20] is the revealed word? It's our
[2:33:21] bridegroom.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Just love him and make love to him and
[2:33:24] spend time with him and submit to him
[2:33:27] and everything will come out just fine.
[2:33:30] And let's pray a prayer of thanksgiving.
[2:33:32] I think again. Lord Jesus, we're so
[2:33:34] thankful, God, for the word, for the
[2:33:36] gift of song,
[2:33:38] God, for the capping off with the
[2:33:40] testimony in the word that Lord, no
[2:33:42] matter what happens, we still live a
[2:33:44] life, Lord, that sometimes is confusing
[2:33:47] and we don't always understand what's
[2:33:49] taking place in our life.
[2:33:52] But God, you have a purpose. You have a
[2:33:54] plan. You've revealed it to us and we
[2:33:56] know it's true. And so God, we're just
[2:33:59] going to believe and stay with you and
[2:34:01] love you and put you first. We're going
[2:34:04] to make you our all and all and
[2:34:07] surrender our all to you.
[2:34:10] Lord, we thank you for what you've done
[2:34:11] for us today. May it have impact in our
[2:34:14] souls. May the word bear fruit and the
[2:34:17] gifts of song. May, Lord, may it bring
[2:34:19] changes in us that reflect your very
[2:34:22] purpose in this hour. God, that's our
[2:34:25] desire. We love you. you bless your
[2:34:26] people as we go. Thank you for this
[2:34:29] time. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:34:33] Amen. God bless you. Thanks, brother.
