TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god said let there be light and there was light and it come to pass but you remember before earth and all this come into existence it was all in god's mind but now it's just being played out and it being manifested amen so satan had thoughts also in his mind what he wants to do amen satan thought did not start here on earth satan thought started when he was in heaven is that right and that's what we actually just read satan telling what i'm going to do but what's so interesting when when you look at the scripture and you go to the message satan's eden the prophet said god eaten was established in righteousness satan eden is established in sin because satan is sin god is righteous and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and satan establishment is in sin and religious sin i like how he just added it in in sin religious sin he said now notice how he deceived his deception as he said he would then he said he promised to do this then he refers to isaiah so what satan was saying in isaiah i'm going to be like the mohawk satan was making a promise otherwise i promise you this is what i'm gonna do god got promises and the devil got promises but the only difference is is god promises this to bless you satan promises to bless himself that's the only difference can we say amen even when you look in the scripture satan say i will be like the most high i will ascend it to heaven i will exalt my throne i will sit upon the mountain all of those are satan's eyes but then when you go to the book of ezekiel god got eyes god said i will take away your stony heart i will give you a new spirit god said i will do this i will call you from the nation but the only difference satan eyes is for himself but god eyes is for you god said i'm gonna do this for you i'm gonna take care of you i'm gonna change you but satan said all of my eyes is for me
