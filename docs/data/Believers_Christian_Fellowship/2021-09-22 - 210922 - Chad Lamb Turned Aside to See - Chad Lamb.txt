we are to you lord it's such a privilege to sing back praises to your name god thank you for that privilege now as we come lord to read your word we just ask god that you would take control that you would speak through these lips of clay that all that would be said would be truth and everything we would share lord would be your words lord that you would break the bread of life and that you would feed your sheep may we give you preeminence and make way for you to move freely lord in every heart and every life changes lord by the word lift us up lord by your word open our eyes lord by your word and equip us by your word that we might be all that you've called us to be in this day for we love you lord we give you first place in jesus christ's name amen while you're standing let's look at the bible in the book of acts i want to read one scripture acts chapter 7. chapter 7 and i just want to read one verse i would like to read verse 30 together before you're seated acts chapter 7 verse 30. and when 40 years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai an angel of the lord and the flame of fire in a bush you could have your seats amen amen i got uh a little bit of a different service for me and this is uh god leads in strange ways god is god and he can do what he wants amen and we found that he's not always predictable and we can't make him do what we want him to do but god has led me in a way that's uncomfortable for me because he's given me a little thought like one scripture and one quote and he's saying go have fun with that and that's not my nature i like i like it all like i like all the nuts and the bolts and the tiny details and i like it i like it fixed and i like it firm and i like it solid and i like it sure and i feel like he's asking me to step out of the boat and walk on the water by inspiration i'm saying god you've got to help me you've got to make that water solid amen so just pray for me and i just want to give you a little update here in a little testimony mom's surgery went really well so we appreciate you praying for her she's recovering really nicely and some of the sisters here made her food and took it down on sunday and she appreciated that so much it meant a lot to her so we're thankful for that i also want to update you on the service we had last sunday with the yoder family we had a wonderful service it was very nice in their home in the first really the first church service since they were set free and broke out of their denomination and it was just such a sweet atmosphere it was such a blessing to be there with them and god really blessed it and so we've talked to them and we've decided that they would like to have regular services in their home at least for now for a while so the third sunday of every month we're going to have an evening service lord willing over at third place at 5 p.m and like we said before they said everyone's welcome you're all welcome just not at the same time so we've we went over and found out kind of what our capacity is and so uh ev anybody who would like to go they would really love for more to come from the church and they really want to see you and want you to be there and participate and so we're going to accommodate that so if you would like to go and you'd like to be included there's a sign up sheet up the welcome desk if you just write your name how many people would want to come with you when you do come and your phone number brother steve golden is going to help me organize that and make sure that we don't overrun the place and everybody knows when we have room and we have capacity and we'd love to have you there so it's going to be the third sunday of every month lord willing at 5 p.m and then any fifth sunday so there's four months out of the year to have a fifth sunday any fifth sunday we're going to have an evening service over there we're also going to have communion and feet washing so you're welcome to that as well so just get your name on the list talk to brother steve if you'd like to come and we kind of just have to do it with what we have room for first na first come first serve basis and we'll just work our way through the list so we'd love to have your support and they would love to see you so if you could just get on the sign up sheet and we'll stay organized for that we appreciate it and keep praying for them there's a lot happening they had some visitors there that they had been witnessing to that were there levi's brother was there and we were preaching you know we were preaching on samson and samson's lock's growing back and the word coming back at the end of the church ages and i looked over at levi's brother and levi's brothers just he's grinning from ear to ear just hearing the word and i thought praise god you know to react that way not suspicious not stern but hearing the word and enjoying it amen and it feeding into a soul so i it was real blessing and you know we had a chance to pray for the few of those who were sick while they were there and so we're just expecting god to do something for them amen so keep praying for that also this weekend we'll be heading to oregon my family and i for the camp meetings for brother rich cobb so please be in prayer for those meetings and for us traveling this is a really busy time i was i was thinking back when brother rich called me and we make these plans it seemed like such a good idea at the time you know we had nothing planned for this period of time we had a good block set aside then all of a sudden everything piled in mom's surgery levi and his family getting shunned needing services there brother john matthews passing away his funeral and now i'm staggering on my feet thinking what i was thinking what have i done what have i committed to but you know i had to go back to the way i felt at the time that god i felt comfortable with accepting the imitation i felt like it was the leading of the lord so i just want to share with you a testimony i was feeling overwhelmed by this and i don't like being busy and i don't like being away from the church and i don't like having a lot of other ministers minister uh on a uh and you know not be here not preaching not being my post of duty and so i was i was thinking about all that and i got a phone call monday morning and it was from brother abraham myra and brother abraham had been contacted by a sister in california who's originally from africa somewhere and she had heard his testimony and in this testimony he was describing a certain sort of demonic oppression that they fight with over in africa and she had fought with that all of her life and and she didn't know what it was and didn't know the name of it and didn't know and brother abraham was talking about praying for people and them getting delivered of that and so she she has i believe some sort of pentecostal background she doesn't know about the message she just heard it through brother abraham's testimony so somehow she got his number i don't even know how she got his number but she got his email and got contact and they contacted one another and brother abraham talked to her and he told her he said he told her about the message he told her some more of his testimony and he said i've never been able to see i've never seen anybody get delivered from this oppression until they've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and prayed for and she says i want to be baptized in jesus name so he called me and asked he says you know can you baptize her i said sure she's in california and she was willing to come she was willing to come here and all of a sudden i realized this weekend i'm going to oregon and i called her up and she says yes i can come to oregon and so she plans on being at the meetings i just she just called me before she's coming around back she's planning on being there and and i called her yesterday and talked to her and i spoke to her about 30 minutes about brother benjamin's ministry the prophecy of the end time the restoration of the word coming back to the church and she loved it she says i've always wondered why the church doesn't have any more power in it anymore like it used to and i've always looked for a bible study where i can study the bible because i read and read and i don't seem to get anything out of it and i said i've got a book for you and i'm going to bring it to you i was going to mail it to her but i'll see her faster than the mail will work i'm going to take her the seven church ages and she's hungry for the word and the more i told her about the message the more she said praise god praise god praise god so god is good and i am greatly encouraged i needed that little boost of encouragement to be able to go on and do what i believe the lord's leading me to do so if you could be praying for us we need some strength we'd appreciate it and also the brothers who are going to step in and help here i really appreciate them and i appreciate you standing behind them brother ben's going to preach for us on sunday and then brother kyle is going to preach again on wednesday so just hold those brothers up in prayer they're a great help to me and i appreciate that and just stand behind them we pray that god will keep feeding the sheep and when i get back i am not going to plan anything for a long long time and so we can just have church together and enjoy one another and maybe rest a little bit anyhow i want to look back at this scripture if you can look at this with me and then we're going to turn to exodus like i said this was a little bit this was an inspiration that came and i couldn't get away from it and we'll just see how it goes i just got some things on my heart i want to share and and here in verse 30 it talks about and 40 years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai an angel of the lord in a flame of fire and a bush so there was a certain period of time and when that time had expired now god when he was going to call moses and send moses back to finish his commission to fulfill what he was born for the purpose that he was born for god sent an angel to the lord then appeared in the form of an angel order a pillar of fire in the bush that was burning to send moses back and i want to read that in exodus chapter 3 if we could all turn there together exodus chapter 3 exodus chapter 3 and verse 1 [Music] now moses kept the flock of drethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned see so many times we we get accustomed to bible stories and and we read things and we just read them and read them and read them but but there's always sometimes the thought just strikes you when it strikes you you read it like you've never read it before and you think why did god do it this way like why didn't god just come why didn't the angel appear as a man and talk to him why in a burning bush and and so i just want to read and i want to follow this thought as we go but just think about that he saw a great sight the bush is not burned and so moses said i will now turn aside i'm sorry verse 3 i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned and brother branham tells us and we're going to read a quote here that moses was raised in all this scientific understanding and knowledge and so it that bush got his attention because it was burning but it was not consumed and he had some scientific background and understanding being educated in egypt and it caught his attention and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw nigh he said draw not not nigh hither put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where i'll now stand this is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry by reason of their tax masters for i know their sorrows and i am come down i want you to catch that i am come down god was not saying i'm coming i will come i've come before he said i've come down and you know so many times when god comes down amen we're looking for a certain something amen and moses didn't know he was supposed to be looking for a burning bush but he saw this bush burning and it attracted his attention and when he got near to the attraction the attraction began to speak to him and when the attraction began to speak to him it began to declare amen the attraction began to declare who was really in the attraction it was god he said i am god i am the god of thy fathers i am the god of abraham isaac and jacob and he's beginning to reveal to him i am the god of those saints that are still alive amen they're not dead i'm god of the living not the dead jesus brings that up but i'm the god of everyone that i made the promise to i am your god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob so he begins to declare who he is and he says and then he starts to talk about the promise and he starts to talk about the condition of his people amen in the promise that he's made them and he says i come for verse 8 again and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and large into a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites and now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come up unto me and i've also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt so catch this now the attraction amen on the mount goddess attention but the attraction brought him to a certain place and god began to speak to him out of the attraction and begin to declare himself and moses's commission and that god has now come down and that now god was going to send moses amen so god was coming down to deliver the children of israel but when the children of israel saw the deliverance come they didn't see god they saw moses because god says i've come down now you go amen and what was that god was coming down to deliver but he was going to use a man to do the delivering and so now when god come down he was commissioning the right man to go amen and bring the children out it wasn't moses doing the work it was god doing the work amen moses was the vessel that he was using and i was listening to a message the third exodus and this is where this thought came brother branham in the third exodus he starts to read the same scripture passage we just read and when he gets to the fourth verse let's read that together he says something interesting he said and when the lord saw that he turned aside to sea and brother man stops he says i want to lay emphasis on that i want to lay emphasis on that so let's read it again and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see and he says i want to lay emphasis on that so i kept waiting for him to lay emphasis on that and i kept waiting and i kept waiting and he never came back to it he just wanted to emphasize that statement and as i meditated on it god kept drawing my attention to it and god kept emphasizing that statement to me amen because god had set an attraction on the mountain amen and god was watching to see what moses would do about the attraction and it says when when the lord when when the lord saw that he turned aside to sea god called unto him out of the midst of the bush so god was watching what moses would do with this attraction amen he set an attraction moses was attracted to the attraction and when the lord saw that he that he turned to side to see then he began to speak to him and this is where god began to really really begin to deal with me on this because there's been an attraction in our day there's been a sign on the mountain amen and and and what kind of attraction is it and who's it supposed to attract in the voice of the sign he says now notice when this unusual thing never had happened in the world as we know of it was just the time of the exodus the exodus was at hand and when the exodus means being taken out brought out and now we find out that usually just as those joint crossroads of an exodus then the unusual begins to happen listen that's true for god's great plan for his children but that's true in our lives too whenever we come to a crossroads unusual things begin to happen we got to pay attention to those unusual things i i just want to stop and inject this this is not really what i intended to go into but but you know whenever we get into crossroads there's always transitions and crossroads in our lives amen but god is always so good to do something amen supernatural in some way bring an attraction and speak to us out of the attraction amen and we've got to be careful that we're not so stuck in a right and we're not so blind to what god's doing that we don't open our eyes and see that god is trying to attract our attention so he can speak to us unusual things happen unusual things are said unusual circumstances work around us amen and we we've got to be aware you know and moses could have been so uh you know moses could have been so frustrated with what the condition of his life he could have been upset because he had a hot tempered wife and there might have been an exchange that wasn't so pleasant that morning and he's out tending the the flock and he he's hurting the flock and and maybe he's got one that's just not not listening maybe he's got one that's just not cooperating and he's so frustrated his head's down and he's in the molly grumps and he could look up on the mountain i don't know if he looked this way or that way i don't know which way he looked but he looked and he saw a fire and he could just see the fire and drop his head and say my life stinks and i don't know why it's what we all do it's what we all do god is so good to put an attraction amen and do something to get our attention amen but we've got to break out of our rat and we've got to get our heads you know out of the my life is horrible everything's going wrong maybe god's got you in a transition time amen maybe you're coming to a crossroads and if you come to that place look around because he's got a way of drawing your attention amen he's got a way of doing something out of the normal and an unusual way that he can talk to you out of that way so this is what god does for his whole nation amen that's what he does for us individually as well at least that's been my experience many times so he says the unusual begins to happen i believe we're there again i believe we're there at the exodus of the bride to go meet the bridegroom i believe the exodus is at hand and this exit is to be brought from egypt back to their homeland where they were promised to come was just at hand and god had to re-educate his man remember moses was educated for 40 years getting all of his doctor's degrees and everything and it taken god just another 40 years to take out of him what education had been put in him 40 years in the wilderness what taken it out taken take in out it was to put it in then then and all this great thing was out of him god appeared to him in a form of a burning bush now i'll show you that it was out of him all that teaching he had learned was now worked out of him now if not now moses being a scientist he would have went to take some of those leaves off a tree and take them down to the lavatory and have them examine to see what kind of chemical it was sprayed with that the tree wouldn't burn and not burn up sea because now the egyptians were smart scientific people more smarter in science than we are today proves that they could embalm a body that still looks natural today we can't do that build a pyramid we can't do that the things that they they had were far beyond our science today and so moses was trained in all the wisdom so that made him a scientist so you see when he come to the presence of this bush he knowed the bush had what he lacked he wasn't going there to try to discover the secrets in the bush he wasn't there to try to explain amen how it could burn and not be he was mesmerized by it caught his attention god knew how to get his attention but when he got there and that voice spoke to him he realized that this bush has what i lack if we could only do that today if we could only know that the phenomenon of god has got what we lack in our denomination i want to read that again so we catch it he knowed the bush had what he lacked if we could only do that today if we could only know the phenomena of god has got what we lack in our denominations what our education system lack god has got it in the phenomena of the presence of christ that's what we need the phenomena of this day has what the denomination lacks just like that burning bush had what moses lacks moses didn't go to use his intellect to figure it out i mean god knew how to attract him but when he got there there was something else taking place amen god was now a man going to unravel the mystery of moses's life because moses was born a proper child his mother became his nurse the prophet of god tells us she began to tell him amen the stories and the prophecies and the promise to abraham and tell him that he was born to be this deliverer and he had heard it from his mom and he believed it amen and he went to go act upon it when he went to go act upon it he failed he killed one egyptian and was rejected by his brethren and so he goes in that rejection amen and he runs into the wilderness and he's there 40 years tending his father-in-law sheep away from the commission moving in the opposite direction of what he thought his life's purpose was of what he thought he was supposed to be doing but in the in a moment god caught his attention in an attraction on the mountain and in the attraction on the mountain when he drew near god was watching for him to draw near and when he drew near god began to speak to him and when god spoke to him he unraveled this whole mystery amen moses thought he had missed something moses thought he had he had walked away and now god was going to get somebody else to deliver the people or maybe i misunderstood or it wasn't for me or i had the wrong idea you can only imagine what moses had thought for 40 years you can only imagine in his backs and condition on the backside of the desert amen but god was training him and working certain things out of him so god could use him and in a moment in the phenomena of god amen at the presence of the burning bush the attraction on the mountain that attracted him when that attraction began to speak to him the spoken the the presence of god speaking to him through that attraction began to unravel the mystery amen and tell him he was who his mom told him he was the promise is sure and i have come down to deliver my people because it was never supposed to be you moses it was supposed to be me in you you never were supposed to do it by yourself you were never supposed to accomplish the calling and the purpose you weren't the one it was my promise amen you were just a tool that i was going to use and you got discouraged because you thought it was you that had to do it you didn't realize amen you were supposed to be the tool amen so in the presence of the phenomenon and the presence of the attraction on the mountain the voice that began to speak back begin to set everything in order according to the promise you are the chosen vessel i am the god of your father abraham isaac and jacob i have heard the cry of my people i am taking them to the land i promise i have come down and now you go praise god we know moses had been so thoroughly whipped out that he began to argue with god he had been so thoroughly god had done such a good job of scrubbing all of moses out of moses that moses now says i can't talk and he says well i'll give you abraham say well they won't listen to me or i'll give you two signs and and god was working with moses to get him back into the commission and giving him signs and giving him uh his brother to speak on his behalf he had been so whipped out he thought he couldn't do it but but the burning bush had what he was lacking amen he says again in the voice of the sign now notice he is going to speak by his promised words something that he said he is going to do notice i have heard and i remember my promise i heard their cries in egypt i remember what i promised abraham see what he's going to do the attraction he attracted his attention now he has got his word so he attracted his attention so he could give him his word he's going to give it to the prophet moses because that was and ever is his way of speaking now i want to read a quote now out of what is the attraction on the mountain because there was an attraction on that mountain in that day but there's been an attraction on the mountain mount sunset in our day and i just want to read about that in this quote for just a minute it's a lengthy quote but just just pay close attention brothers and i started up the mountain running as hard as i could on the other side all of a sudden i thought somebody shot me i never heard such a blast it shook the whole country and when it did standing before me with seven angels in a cluster i met brother fred and them a little after said what was it i said that was it what are you going to do return home for thus saith the lord the seven mysteries that's been hid in the bible all these years these denominations and everything god is going to open up those seven mysteries to us in the seven seals there was that circle coming up from the earth like a mist forming when it did it went plum up into the mountain begin to circle on westward from the way it comes science founded after a while 30 miles high 25 miles across just exactly in the circle of the pyramid and the other day standing there turned the picture to the right and there is jesus as he was in the seven church ages so he's got this picture and it's the capstone and at the time that this happens when brother branham has this uh when he has this experience on sunset mountain brother branham doesn't know somebody took a picture of it he doesn't know anybody else had a picture or or saw it he knows what he saw and what cesar and what he was caught up into was a confirmation of a vision that he had and in that in that attraction on the mountain when he was caught into it amen to begin to speak to him and send him back into his commission to go back east to preach the seven seals he was doing the same thing for him it did for moses it was beginning to tell him that now is the time for the opening of the seals and you're the one that i'm going to use to do it go back east and later he's looking at the pictures he's later in may you know the publication of life magazine comes out and sometime after that brother benham has shown the picture and and then he's looking at this picture and and in the picture the voice speaks to him and says turn it right and he thinks i'm looking at it right so no turn it to the right so he thought he said i thought maybe he meant to the right and he turned it to the right and he said there it was and in the within the white wig of the angel's wings was hoffman's head of christ it was jesus christ and that's him and that's what he's referring to here he says there turn the picture to the right and there is jesus as he was in the seven church ages the white wig on showing supreme deity he's alpha and omega he's the first and the last he's the supreme judge of all eternity standing there confirm the message of this hour and there shall be light about the evening time what is it all about what was it i went westward upon the same mountain passing up with banks woods there said throw up a rock say to mr woods thus saith the lord you'll see the glory of god the very next day standing there a whirlwind came down and blasted the mountains out rocks cut the top of the trees off about three or four feet above my head and made three big blasts and the brothers come running over there was about 15 men standing there preachers and everything else what was it he said what was it i said judgment striking the west coast about two days after that the earthquake almost sunk alaska what is this light up on sunset mountain you know brother branham called that cloud a light called it a light call it the pillar of fire he called it the cloud he said what what is this what is this light what is the strange thing that happened up there let me find my spot yeah what is this light up on sunset mountain in the coronado forest of arizona what is this strange thing that happened up there that the people has been driving east from west picking up the rocks that laid around where it struck and every one of them every rock has three corners on it that tore it off the three or one they're laying on desks on paperweights across the nation what is this strange thing upon sunset mountain in the coronado forest junior jackson listening in you remember the dream he had that i interpreted going towards the setting of the sun this happened on sunset mountain it's the evening time sunset time the sunset message through a setting of history a setting of prophecy rather being fulfilled and it shall be light at the evening time upon sunset mountain in the coronado forest 40 miles north of tucson get on the map and see if it's sunset peaked there that's exactly where it happened i never knew known until the other day everything that shall that shall never die it's constantly unrolling itself from the very thing happening to the picture being jesus standing looking at us and now exactly on sunset mountain and the sunset light the evening light has come god vindicating himself what is it it's a fact that god in christ are one the white how many seen it the white wig upon him as we talked in revelation 1 see the supreme deity supreme authority no other voice no other god no other nothing in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily the angels themselves was his wig amen what's happened upon mount sunset god confirming his word what happened upon mount sinai in the burning bush god confirming his word what happened in sunset mountain god confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's god fulfilling his promised word again of revelation 10 1-7 what was that all about revelations 10 1-7 that's what it was all about the cloud the light the cloud on sunset mountain being caught up in a constellation of angels told to come back east for the preaching of the seven says what's it all about it's the fulfillment of the word it's a confirmation of the word revelation 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished the hidden mystery of revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last church age fulfills exactly in this age saint luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed what is the attraction on the mountain god fulfilling his word if we could have the powerpoint brother franco if you don't mind bringing that up for me i just want to go through a couple quotes i didn't do a very good job brother franco helped me get a few slides together i didn't do a very good job of filling them out but i just want to share a couple things out of the third exodus it says now look how simple he does it i have come down i heard the cry remember my promise i've come down to do it i'm sending you on mount sinai in the attraction on the mountain it was god declaring that i've come down to fulfill the word i've come down to keep my promise but i'm sending you you do it i'm going to be with you certainly i'll be with you and my never failing presence will be with you wherever you go don't be afraid see i'm coming down to deliver i'm sure the spiritual mind catches that brother branham's running a parallel and he's expecting the spiritual mind to catch that and the message the absolutely said when moses met this burning bush you know and that burning bush claim proved to be god that's that light that pillar of fire that proved to be god and i believe that god come in moses because watch him in his creative power moses shine then with the fire so brother branham is saying that that that sign that took place on mount sinai that burning bush that caught moses attention god come down in a certain way and he had a certain kind of an attraction and that attraction was for that day and that attraction was for a specific purpose and it was for a specific purpose and god knew how to attract his attention and in the attraction when when moses was drawn to that the attraction began to speak to him this catches the attraction began to speak and when he began to speak it began to speak to prophecy for his day the fulfillment of the word for his day and it was a declaration the traction and the voice behind the attraction was a declaration that god had come to fulfill his word and now he had a vessel here at the attraction that he was going to use to go fulfill it in i'm come down to deliver them you go and it was god coming in moses it was god coming through and working through a vessel amen so that when god come down to deliver the children they couldn't see they didn't even see what moses saw they they just had to believe moses and god gave him signs so they would believe him but they didn't see what moses saw they had to take his testimony of it they didn't see the attraction they could only see the signs that followed and the word that he was bringing the vindication amen but but they had to trust that this is what god told him and that god was come down and he was sent and god was there to deliver them but they couldn't see another being they couldn't see another physical form they had to take the one that had been at the attraction and they had to take the one that had heard the voice and the one that heard the word and come down and he had to say now listen he sent me down to tell you that he's here he sent me here to tell you that he has come down to deliver you and you're saying how has he come down show me how he's coming where is he at and he's saying i've got these signs i don't want to look at you moses i want to see god but he says but he told me i'll show you these signs and by these signs you'll know that i'm his representative and they're saying what are you trying to say i'm trying to say that god is here i'm trying to say that god has come down in this day to fulfill his promise and he attracted me in an attraction on the mountain and that attraction spoke to me and told me now is the time for the prophecy i thought it was earlier i made a mistake and i thought i wasn't even qualified anymore the one but that attraction told me that now's the time he's the one he's come down and he's coming through me he sent me to represent this deliverance they had to believe moses moses was carrying the message moses had the vindication moses had been at the attraction on the mountain moses had heard the voice moses received the word and moses was now giving it out in our day there's been an attraction on the mountain brother venom saw the constellation of seven angels coming as a as a constellation in a pyramid form he was caught up into this constellation and i'm going to skip ahead here i want to read two passages of scripture and i want to get back to this revelations 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour see there was a prophecy in the old testament that your children to abraham your children shall show jordan in a strange land for 400 years but i'll bring them out with a mighty hand and i'll bring him back to this land of promise that word was there amen but that word was waiting for an attraction on the mountain to put it in the in the action to attract the prophet and get the prophet into action it was waiting for god's time when it was god's time he brought an attraction on the mountain but there's been another prophecy that has been laying in the bible waiting for an attraction on the mountain to put it in the action and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour but what's that got to do with the cloud it's got everything to do with that cloud revelation 10 1-4 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire brother bam said it's none other but christ it could be the angel of the covenant christ and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not so what the seven thunders uttered was sealed up so what the seven thunders uttered became silent so the silence on the seventh seal and the silence of the seven thunders in revelation 10 go go together brother bennett said they're connected they're the same thing and what are you what are we waiting for for the thunders watch the pattern in the pattern christ comes down clothed with the clown when he comes down and sets his foot on one foot on the sea and one foot on the land then he cries with the loud roars when a lion roars and seven thunders utter their voice so to get the seven thunders to utter their voice amen this mighty angel has to come down with a book that's already open in his hand you come down with an open book and seven thunders utter their voices what does that have to do with the cloud it has everything in the world to do with that cloud amen here's a quote out of it is the rising of the sun he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of the seals then revealing christ and the very seven angels which represent the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming there's a reason that i'm reading all this and i pray that god will just help me share it so it doesn't look like a bunch of fragmented things but but may god bring it all together for us he says here the opening of the seals is revealing christ and the very seven angels that's in that cloud amen they represent the seven church ages all completed so when you see that cloud it's the completion of the seven church ages those seven angels represent the seven churches completed because when the seven church ages are completed now he's come down to unite with his bride at the completion of the seven church ages so when you see that cloud you recognize where we are in time we've come to the completion of the seven church ages and that means that brings us to the end of time and at the end of time there's an end of time seal and the end of time seal is the seventh seal and at the opening of the seventh seal it marks that we're at the end of time at the completion of the seven church ages which is represented in seven angels amend their wings making making a wig at first brother brennam saw a capstone at first he saw seven angels at first he saw the constellation but after a while he was told to take the capstone the capping off the finishing of the pyramid the all seven church ages complete and down you're being capped off by the word of god by the revelation amen that's been hid in this bible by the revelation that's been silent all these years and he he knew it was the angels amen he knew it was the completion of the seventh church he knew it was the capstone and the capping off but what he realized when he was told to turn it to the right when he so to turn it to the right he realized it was christ amen it was jesus christ coming to unite with his bride it was the headship coming to the body amen for the marriage in the seventh seal he says another thing i want you to notice what taken place and if you're listening to the tape of what time is it sir you will notice that one angel was very notable to me the rest of them just seemed ordinarily brother kyle went into this on sunday but this angel was a noted angel he was to my left in the constellation in the form of a pyramid and you remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious white rock was not written on now he's referring back to junior jackson's dream and junior jackson had a dream that was this great hillside and brother ben calls it a pyramid amen and their water had washed off the soil and the grass and there was there was strange engravings like hieroglyphs around it and brother ben was walking around interpreting the words on the outside of the stone to the people and when he got done interpreting all that word amen he reached up and grabbed a sharp object like a crowbar or maybe like the king's sword like like like brother kyle was saying a sharp object anyways let's just say it that way and he pried the top of that off and underneath was white rock and he said the sun's never shown on this amen this is unwritten word something in the bible that has not been revealed what in the bible has not been revealed what in the bible was not written amen that silence amen when the seventh seal opened there was silence nothing was written then when the seven thunders uttered their voices nothing was written it's there it's in the bible we know it's there but nothing's been written so brother branham now when he's talking about services it's the time the constellation the form of the pyramid he goes right back to junior jackson's dream and he says and you remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious white rock was not written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves follow this the angels took me into the pyramid of themselves the mysteries of god known only to them and now they with the messengers that come to interpret and they with the messengers that come to interpret that pyramid or that message of the secret of these seven seals which lays with inside the pyramid brother said inside that pyramid is a mystery and these seven angels i just want to read it correctly these seven angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the mysteries of god known only to them and now they with the messages that came to interpret the pyramid or the message of the secret of those seven seals which lays with inside the pyramid god brother brahm is drawing our attention to the fact that the mystery that laid in the bible this seven thunder mystery this silence in the seventh seal this part that you know is part of the word you know it's in the bible it's in there but nothing's written in it nothing's written about it amen but these angels caught me into the pyramid of themselves the mysteries that are only known to them so brother branham gets caught into the constellation i think this is important and this is oh god help me i just want to spend some time on this he was caught into this pyramid in the pyramid is the mystery the unwritten word the mystery and so now the mysteries in the pyramid i want you to catch that where's the mystery in the pyramid amen and this pyramid is made up by the seven messengers they have this mystery all to themselves now and brother branham is caught up into the pyramid what's in the pyramid the mystery where's brother branham in the pyramid what's in the pyramid the mystery where's brother branham in the pyramid so brother branham he gets caught up and told to go back east and now when he walks back he's the mystery that's come out of the pyramid i want you to catch that when moses goes into the mountain and gets the commission now he's the mystery amen with him is the deliverance with him is the the the knowledge that god has come down to deliver his people with him has come the timing of deliverance amen and the method for deliverance he is now the mystery part of that prophecy is now with moses because moses was at the burning bush he was attracted to the attraction the attraction spoke to him and gave him the word and now he comes down and he's the mystery of that prophecy and now brother ram gets caught up into the the the constellation and he's told to go back for the preaching of the seven seals and now he's walking from this attraction amen and now he he is the mystery and i i wish that i could do a better job of intellectually explaining that but god is not going to let me do that it's got to be caught by revelation i'm saying what i'm saying by the inspiration of god knowing good well that i cannot piece this together any simpler than i'm doing it now but it's absolutely the truth there was a mystery in that prophet after he got caught up in the constellations and it was the mystery of the of the seventh seal amen and that seventh seal the timing of the of the fulfillment of the prophecy when it was going to come how it was going to come how god was going to speak those seven thunders it was now in this mystery man that had come from the attraction on the mountain and he got caught up and what was he caught up into he was caught up into the pyramid of the seven angels he was caught up into the location of the mystery and the location of the mystery was in that pyramid of the seven angels and they represented the seven church ages complete because through the seven church ages there'd been a mystery forming nobody understood that mystery that was forming but it was forming through the seven church ages as those seven church age messengers came each angel came and it sees in its time to reveal part of that mystery and now it was all completed and it was time for the revelation to be made known and the seven angels come down and make the pyramids showing that it's now completion and he's got caught up into the mysterious part where nothing's written he's caught into that and he's brought back out as the mystery but then later he finds out there's a picture taken and he sees the picture then he's told to turn the picture to the right and he finds out where he's been he thought he was in the pyramid the capstone he thought he was in the mystery that was contained in the seven angels but then he realized he was in the mind of christ amen he had been caught up into the very headship amen the word himself had caught him up and he had been in the mind of god and now he was coming out with the mystery of the secret of the back part of god's mind amen these aren't just pictures friends this is a living reality in our lives he became the mystery because now amen he could say at the preaching of the seven thunders which was the preaching of the seven i seals you understand that when he come to preach he said seven thunders thundering out right in a row one two three four five six seven like spelling something out amen one blast the blast that was on mount sunset amen then seven thunders amen one blast when the seals open when the first seal there was a loud blast amen like a thunder and the first beast said come and see then after that all seals open now there's been another great blast on sunset mountain so then there's got to be seven somethings open up and it's the revelation of the seven thunders the preaching of the seven thunders which is the revelation of the seven seals the interpretation of the symbols the opening of the seven seals these aren't just pictures it's not just something to hang on the wall because believers hang it on their wall there's something to it brother rem wasn't told to turn it to the right so that he had a novelty that he could give away and people could see and that we could pass it on the card no it was identifying what those seven angels represented where the mystery was i mean the mystery had been in the back part of god's mind all this time and he got caught up into the headship christ and he came out to bring the revelation and these angels would come one one after another one night after another and bring him the revelation and he would bring the revelation out amen he didn't have he himself didn't have the revelation he was the vessel that god was going to use because only the lamb can break the seals amen the prophet can't break the seals only the lamb can so he's got to come down amen just like god had to come down moses couldn't deliver moses tried to deliver but he could not deliver it was going to come at a time when god would attract him on the mountain and tell him i have come down now to fulfill the word in this revelation of the seventh seal amen this preaching of the seven thunders was not going to take place until it was time for christ to come down that's why he was told to turn the picture to the right so we knew who was here so we know whose mind this was this wasn't the mind of brother branham amen it was the mind of christ amen it was the time for the revelation to come forth and now he would go into the little room day after day because in the in the in the revelation of the third pool when he was taken into the cathedral amen and he was told there's a little room he said i'll meet you in there and he said it'll be your third pool and you won't tell it to nobody it'll be a total secret so i think it's funny that brother branham every day to get the interpretation amen of the next seal he had to go into a little room and in the little room he would meet him there and give him the interpretation he would come out and give it and then he would say now i don't know what's tomorrow night it wasn't him it was christ god had come down to fulfill the promise in our day he said i've come down now i send you i didn't hear him say that i did those angels says go back east for the interpretation of the seven seals what was that he was told to go back i've come down now you go and say what i tell you to say see brother banner says something in souls that are in prison now and i i don't understand it i'm not going to try to explain it in a way that i understand i don't understand it all but he makes this statement that i'm beginning to understand he says he says now at this time noah was in the ark the bride has sealed him with christ the last member has been redeemed the sixth seal has produced itself the seventh seal brings him back to earth the lamb come and took the book out of the right hand of him and sat down and claimed what he owned what he had redeemed that's right it's always been that third pool there's still many things that i can't intellectually explain i can't put it in nice pieces but the seventh seal brings him back to earth and the seventh seal brings him back to earth to claim his bride and to take her in the rapture to unite with her the seventh seal brings him to earth as joseph revealing himself to his brother in 144 thousand and the seventh seal brings him to earth as the son of david in the millennium is that true so the seventh seal brings him to earth the problem is we're we want to wait until the millennium and say he's come but the seventh seal brings him to earth and he comes together to get his bride then he comes to reveal himself to his brethren and then he comes amen to set up his kingdom as the son of david what is that the seventh seal brings him to earth the seventh seal is the end of time seal when everything comes to the end the seventh seal opens and it marks the end amen but brother branham said it's like a roman candle going off he says the end of one thing then that goes out and five more things come out of that then another rocket shoots in five more things it's not the end like now's the end everything's burned off and now the millennium sets in it's the end of the denominational church ages that's ended then it becomes the end of gentile world domination that's coming to an end then it's the end of this and then the end of that and the end of this all the way until the end of the pollution on the earth and it's burnt over with volcanics and atomic fire and he comes and re-establishes his kingdom on the earth for a millennial reign it's ending ending ending and he says it even ends time so time doesn't end until after the millennium because it's a thousand years so the seventh seal is not this moment in time but the seventh seal brings him to earth just like the prophecy of deliverance out of egypt brought god down but when god came down to deliver he sent a prophet and the people were confused moses why did you bring us out here to die moses didn't do anything god brought them out there [Applause] moses why nah now moses you got us in trouble now they've increased our our quota of bricks and they're not providing strong it's gotten hard moses didn't do anything they're so confused about who's present to deliver them they think it's moses it's not moses it's not brother branham amen he's the mystery the mystery is in him but the mystery is the coming of the lord christ came down with an open book and after christ came with an open book seven thunders uttered their voices and we heard them one night second night third night fourth night fifth night amen what was it it was the seven thunder sounding out what's that it shows the seven seals now open when you when you hear those thunders being preached in the seal series it shows that now the seventh seal is open the seventh seal brings him to earth and the seven seals the end of time seal marking end of time has begun and now this will wrap up and then this will wrap up and then this will wrap up and then this will wrap up and people are still waiting for the seventh seal to open and i'm telling you the seven seals been open amen things are wrapping up everything is finishing this is the finish of everything what you're watching on your news is the finishing of everything under the seventh seal we're not waiting for it to start but it started friends it started at the preaching of the thunders i showed the opening of the seal sometimes i just don't know how to preach it like it's so it's so simple with revelation it's so complicated with information i don't know how else to say it it's so simple with revelation you just see it but when you take the information it becomes complicated i hope that doesn't stumble you but it's done that way on purpose the seventh seal brings him back to earth god said in exodus i've come down when god come to deliver the children of israel they didn't see him they saw his representative brother branham says in the message the trial to the jews he was the son of david to the creeks he was the lord the greeks he was the lord to us he's the lord to the gentiles and now in the last days he will return back again a son of man because malachi promised that there would be a prophet rise up in the last days that would return the hearts of the people back away from the organizations back to the original word the faith of the father was the original pentecost and when he did it saint john 14 12 the works that he did would be done also revelation 10 promised a whole mystery how are you going to reveal the mystery see what luther left off see what wesley left off see what pentecost left off and reveal the secrets of a heart to make the same god through every age which is nothing but god's word being made manifest back to the son of man again we don't look for nail scars we look for the word made manifest i don't know what they were looking for in israel but they were confused by what they saw they didn't quite understand their murmurings their complainings their reactions to moses proved that they didn't understand what they were seeing because moses now was holding the mystery of the fulfillment of the word for that hour he had been to the attraction on the mountain he had heard the voice of god he knew the commission in the hour and the time he knew who he was and he began to move forward with that understanding but this is where i'm not so normal now i begin to meditate and i begin to think moses his the phenomena that caught his attention was for him only nobody else saw it is that true he was the only one who saw it it was only for him and so many things took place to prophets and to individuals and the phenomena was to them only and they were the only ones who'd seen it others could see the effect of it but they couldn't see it because there was no mechanical eye of a camera to take the picture of the phenomenon that day but brother branham said in this day he says science took the picture not us they saw it not us and i i started to ask myself the question why in this day is there a picture that every one of us can hold up and turn to the right and look at the capstone and see seven angels and they're making up a wig of christ and turn it how come you can hold a picture like this and do like this and say ah i think i see this and look at that and those look like wings and you see moses's attraction was from moses i think brother brown's attraction was for more than just brother branham well you know i mean just science evolved and technology come on and now we have cameras and it's just it's just happenstance that we got a picture of it no it's absolutely perfect in the will of god that now this phenomenon this attraction on the mountain is not something that takes place privately on the backside of the desert nobody else can see it but now not only did somebody take pictures they took hundreds of pictures and not only did a few people notice that everybody noticed it it created quite a stir there was articles in the paper about it now there was a scientist who studied atmospheric meteorology and he stands outside and looks at it and he puts an ad in the paper calling for pictures to come together so he can analyze this and he begins to describe it and it makes such a roar it's so unusual that life magazine not vanity fair because this isn't vanity not time because this is eternity amen it's life magazine friends life magazine god is not dull amen god is not weak god is not hoping something works out and somebody gets it right but this is in life magazine because this is life coming down this is this is the giver of life this is eternal life breaking forth this is the opening of the seventh seal the end of time seal to bring us into a rapture to bring us back to the right kind of life and this doesn't happen amen so and and just somebody says well this is what i saw we have to hear it and repeat it and read it read it in the book god gave it to you and put it in your hand and he showed you an attraction on the mountain and i think god is sitting here watching to see what you do with the attraction on the mountain this is a different day amen this isn't this isn't just for that one man that one man when he got caught into that constellation he represented the entire church [Applause] the prophet of god was representing you and i amen he was getting caught up in a rapture he was meeting the lord in the air i hope you can see that because who was up there he said it's our lord up there he turned to the right said it's our lord up there where did he go he went up there where did he go he met him in the air and brother brennan said all the way back in 1961 when he was preaching revelation chapter four he was referring to john in chapter four getting caught up and he said in the vision one man can represent the entire church and there even a man in this time get caught up in this constellation and come out as the mystery that was in that constellation the seventh seal and god wasn't going to do like he did in moses day this time now we know christ come down because he's the only one who could open the seals he's the one with the book in his hand he's the only one that can give the revelation and seven thunders uttered their voices because the seven thunders sealed and the silence and the seventh seal are connected together brother and i said they're the same thing so when brother brennan began to preach those thunders night after night what he was doing he was revealing the silence under the seventh seal showing that this is the time for the opening of the seventh seal and then god puts this attraction on this board and on the paper you can have in a poster on the wall and a picture that you can hang and you can see that attraction you can look up there and you can say oh i wish the kids would listen to me and i wish i had a better job and i wish these goats weren't so hard to chase around this back side of the desert god put the attraction there for a reason he sent it around the world he's printed it on all kinds of forms he's got it in front of our face all the time what is it he set the attraction up just like he did to moses in that day he got something to attract his attention and he was watching is that what the bible tells us he was watching because the scripture says when he saw that moses drew near he spoke to him he was watching for moses to draw near i mean this is a the language in itself is amazing the way it's worded is for a purpose he he set the bush i mean the angel is there the pillar of fire is burning the bush amen and moses is going it's going to attract his attention and he's just going about his daily business he's just doing what he's always done he's got all the same problems he had the day before he may have got a new problem that morning who knows what he's going through who knows what he's thinking but in the day when he didn't expect it at a time when he wasn't looking for it amen there was a pillar of fire there that was going to reveal that the lord had come down and was going to fulfill this promise that he had a question about and god was watching and when the lord saw that he drew near to the bush he spoke to him he began to reveal to him the day in its message he began to reveal to him the purpose of the sign he began to reveal to him what his purpose was in all of this and you and i go through life doing what we do before we come to the message we did what we did we we lived what we lived we do what we do but god had an attraction on the mountain that wasn't just going to be seen by one man that was going to be seen by the whole world and god was watching to see who would draw near the attraction who would draw near to this attraction and when god watched to see who would draw near when he saw you and i draw near to the attraction he began to speak out of the attraction and he began to tell us the day the hour that we live in the message of the hour who's here who's come down to deliver who's fulfilling the word and what our purpose is because once you come in contact with the attraction and find out who's here and what the hour is and what seal is being broke amen you become the mystery in the seal you become the mystery in the pyramid you've been caught up into the mind of christ by revelation brother branham represented it but you and i have to go there each one to be caught up to meet him in the revelation of what this sign represents and when we draw near because of the attraction amen god speaks out of the attraction i wonder what he says this is just brother chad this is just me but to me he says i have come down to fulfill my word in this hour and i'm sending you into the world to represent that this seal is open that i'm alive i'm back in the church again and it's time for me to reveal the further part of my mystery the part that wasn't it wasn't easily uh seen amen the part that was mysterious through seven church ages that i had a bride amen that there was a female part of me to come into expression there was an attraction were you attracted by the attraction are you attracted by the attraction or do you see and say that's a cloud do you see it say well some people doubt it some people say this some people say that who cares what anybody says i don't care what anybody says about that cloud makes no difference to me what anybody in the world says about that cloud because i've drawn near to the attraction it attracted me and god spoke out of the attraction and told me what day it is what part of the word is being fulfilled and what my part is in that i may have had all kinds of doubts in the past about who i am amen and again god used me and if i failed him too much and if i if i'd been back on the backside of the desert separated from the economy of god so long that he now can't use me you think moses never had a thought like that you've had thoughts like that we've all had thoughts like that but oh my oh my he has an attraction on the mountain and he can speak out of the attraction today there's a reason it was in life magazine there's a reason it's been published over and over it's a reason it's still distributed all over the place it's to attract his end-time bride god allowed that man to represent us getting caught up into the constellation of angels which we found out was the headship of christ which we found out was the mystery that laid in the bible which christ is the mystery of god revealed he turned it to the right and realized who this is that's bringing this revelation who this is that's come down in this hour who this where brother branham was and i was represented there i was represented in that catching up i was represented in that sign and now spiritually when i come in contact with this sign again i'm caught up brother chad you got caught up into the constellation of angels listen turn the picture to the right turn it to the right i want to ask you have you united with christ in this hour have you connected with the headship if you have connected with the headship you got caught up into that constellation because that's the headship of christ you've entered into the mind of christ at the revealing of the word when god revealed it personally to you you went into that cloud your feet may not have left the ground you may not have a picture of you on the inside of it but if you've been connected to christ in this hour if the headship has come to you if you've entered into an invisible you with christ you've been in that cloud you've been connected to him all of these things are abstract all of these things are intangible all these things i can't help that i can't help it that we can't make it uh a creed that we repeat we can't make it a lesson that we learn we can't make it a church that we attend we can't make it a statement that we say we can't make it anything other than it is it's the revelation of the hour it's the coming of the lord it's the opening of the seventh seal it's the uniting of the bride in christ amen and it takes place spiritually but because it's spiritually it doesn't mean it's not real doesn't mean it's not physical doesn't mean it's not literal we get so stuck carnal we're so carnal that we have to touch we've got to touch something like this this is real i'm telling you this is not real but what is spiritual is more real than this your life is called a vapor just a mist this world is not what's tangible the other side is more real than this but we get so carnal and so earthy that we've got to see nail scars we've got to see a physical form we've got to be like the children were in egypt when god come down to deliver them they wouldn't even receive their deliverance so carnal so carnal it's got to be physical it's got to be understandable it's got to you know one thing has to go first and the next thing comes next and then we add this and it doesn't work logically [Applause] revelation doesn't work logically the mind of man i hope i'm not scaring you i can't i can't help but preach what god has given me to preach i can't help but share it the way it's real in my heart amen it's not it's not a it's not a graph it's not a chart it's not all the pieces of information put together so tight that everybody can see it no it's coming in contact with the attraction on the amount and let the attraction speak to you what's the attraction is it a cloud is it a picture is it a message novelty is it a witnessing card to me to me it's the attraction on the mountain it's the recognition of my day and its message it's the recognition of the time of the end time seal to come open the reality i don't know how else to say it it's more real than anything we've ever touched tasted felt stood upon it's this message is not a bunch of words this message is not tapes this message is christ it was him coming to open the seals it was him coming to reveal the mystery that was laying in the bible it was him amen that was giving those seven thunders he was just using a vessel but just as sure today it's him in the revelation of the seventh seal it's him amen christ in bright form it's him just as real as he ever was he's here but he's working in vessels again he's working in vessels who've got caught up into the reality of the revelation who've been caught up into the headship to the mind of christ and been got up into the constellation of the angels into the pyramid that contains the mysteries within themselves and they've come back out and now the mystery is in them now they're part of the mystery see elijah was given a commission and elijah goes to fulfill that commission but elijah doesn't finish the commission elisha finishes the commission and we live in this day where god amen took the prophet off the scene because the elisha the bride has got to finish this commission she has got to finish this revelation of the mystery she has to live this revelation of the mystery she has to be him it has to be him revealed in her it's got to be more it's got to be more than a picture it's got to be more well i've seen that all my life well you're more blessed than generations and generations that have been upon this earth let's not go through life so busy in our minds and so preoccupied with life that we walk by the sign and say yeah i know what that is that was so tied up and so busy and so worn out and you're like yeah i they preach on that all the time i know what that is oh it's got to be more than that friends it's got to be not a picture in your wallet not a picture on your wall but it's got to be something that that has happened to you an attraction that has attracted you and you've been caught up in it and god has spoke to you and revealed to you the hour that we live in and now you're the walking part of this mystery you've been there you've been united with that headship now i'm here on this earth not like i was before because brother bam said after the opening of the seals he goes i can never think the same again the bible has become a new book to me once you've come in contact with the headship of christ in the revelation of the hour amen you can never think the same again just as different let the attraction be an attraction if god sets before his attraction let's draw near to the attraction and when he sees us drawing near to the attraction may he speak to us out of the attraction let's all stand brother ben if you and the musicians could come oh i just want to say i love you i love you i wish i wish that i could take it from in here and stick it right inside but god chose to use the foolishness of preaching because he's got a powerful mechanism called revelation and god is only going to allow it by the powerful force of revelation and he's not going to let man ruin this thing he's not going to let man man handle it he's going to let us preach it in weakness with limited language with the best we can but still with many holes in many gaps because he's got a mechanism called revelation and he can bring the reality of it to us let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you god i thank you that there was a time that you attracted me lord and you knew how to attract me because you put something inside of me that would be attracted to this manifestation you pre-arranged it you pre-programmed me but oh god how thankful i am that when i saw the cloud lord i wasn't like millions of others who said that's a cloud or that's an unusual cloud but god as i began to draw near to the cloud you spoke to me out of this revelation you told me who i am and who you are told me that you're here to fulfill your word god it means more to me than life i pray that you'd bring this revelation to your bride lord god i i've done all that i know to do the best that i could do and it wasn't man's efforts are always feeble lord i know that but god this is how you've led me this is what i've done according to what you've led me to do and i'm praying that you would do the part that no human being can do i pray that you would unlock revelation in the hearts and lives of your people lord those that have come close to the attraction today the attraction on the mountain now lord they've seen it they've come face to face let them not walk by it lord let them not move away and say it's too complicated i don't understand but let them draw near lord and as they draw near i pray you'd speak to them out of the attraction reveal to them who they are the hour that they live the word is to be manifest that you're here to bring it to pass we love you god and we ask you would just help us more i pray that you bless this assembly lord while i'm gone bless me lord and my family as we travel to oregon i pray you would anoint me for the services there that your people would be blessed there i pray that you'd bless the services here lord that your sheep will be fed lord god that you would help us to grow and be what you've called us to be in this hour lord according to your will may you bring us back lord for a great union a reunion and that we might share testimonies and fellowship together god i commit this congregation to your hands i commit myself into your hands i thank you for what you've done in this hour i thank you for the revelation in my life i pray that you'd help it to grow lord i want to know you more i want to know you better lord i want to walk closer to you than ever before i want to see you more clearly than i ever have i pray that
