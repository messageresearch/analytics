[4:47] [Music]
[4:50] so good to be here with you this evening
[4:52] let's take our bibles while we're
[4:54] standing together and we'll go right to
[4:56] the word
[5:00] amen we're going to take our bibles and
[5:02] turn to genesis chapter 2.
[5:05] we'll start there we're going to
[5:06] continue on with religion versus
[5:08] relationship
[5:09] this is part 10 i believe and
[5:12] i'd like to minister on free will not
[5:15] self-will
[5:17] it's an evident self-evident title free
[5:20] will
[5:21] not self-will amen those are two very
[5:24] different things
[5:26] genesis chapter 2 let's begin at verse
[5:28] 16.
[5:31] and the lord god commanded man saying of
[5:33] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[5:34] freely eat
[5:36] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[5:38] and evil thou shall not eat of it
[5:40] for in the day that you eatest thereof
[5:42] thou shalt surely die
[5:45] now in an initial reading of this you
[5:48] can look at this
[5:49] and it almost looks as if god is
[5:51] attaching a punishment to a breaking of
[5:54] the commandment
[5:55] but i don't know that that is exactly
[5:58] the way that we should read this
[5:59] i believe it was a warning from god
[6:01] because god knew the consequences of
[6:03] eating that tree
[6:05] it wasn't that god wanted to give a
[6:06] commandment so that he could give a
[6:08] punishment
[6:10] if god gave a commandment because he
[6:12] knew if they partook of that tree
[6:14] what would go they would die they would
[6:17] die spiritually and they would begin to
[6:18] die
[6:19] physically so he was warning his son
[6:22] against the tree
[6:23] he was not setting something up so that
[6:25] he could bring punishment
[6:28] because the commandments of god are not
[6:30] just so that he can bring punishment
[6:32] because he delights in punishment
[6:33] but it's a warning amen stay away from
[6:35] this this is not right this is not good
[6:38] so let's read that again in verse 16 in
[6:40] the lord god commanded the man saying of
[6:43] every tree of
[6:43] the garden thou mayest freely eat but of
[6:46] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[6:47] evil thou
[6:48] shall not eat of it for in the day that
[6:50] thou eateth thereof thou
[6:51] shalt surely die amen let's turn over to
[6:55] chapter 3
[6:56] verse 6.
[6:59] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[7:01] good for food
[7:03] now she is now taking what god has given
[7:06] for her protection
[7:08] and through the through the subtility of
[7:11] the serpent
[7:12] he's now got her to look at this tree in
[7:14] a different light
[7:16] and now she begins to look and see that
[7:18] it was good for food
[7:19] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[7:21] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[7:24] see god never said it wasn't pleasant to
[7:27] the eyes
[7:28] he never said it wasn't good for food he
[7:30] never said it wasn't one to make you
[7:32] wise
[7:32] he though all those things could be true
[7:35] amen but what god had told him was still
[7:37] the ultimate truth
[7:40] it was good for food that it was
[7:41] pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be
[7:43] desired to make
[7:44] one wise she took her the fruit thereof
[7:47] and did eat and gave also into her
[7:48] husband with her
[7:49] and he did eat and the eyes of them both
[7:51] were open and they
[7:52] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[7:55] fig leaves together and made themselves
[7:58] aprons let's go ahead and bow our heads
[8:00] and ask the lord's blessing
[8:02] lord jesus we come to you lord because
[8:04] we need you
[8:06] we come because we love you lord we've
[8:08] come to this time
[8:09] god because you've drawn us because your
[8:12] grace has brought us to this place in
[8:14] this hour and
[8:15] awakens something inside of us that
[8:17] loves you and wants more of you
[8:19] god as you've brought us to this place
[8:20] to feed us we now come lord expecting
[8:23] and ask lord that you would break the
[8:25] bread of life for us and give us the
[8:26] portion we need
[8:28] well you would have preeminence and that
[8:29] you would speak and that we would
[8:30] rejoice in your word
[8:32] we ask that you would move everything
[8:34] out of the way that would be an obstacle
[8:36] or a hindrance in our lives
[8:38] and may we feast with you in jesus
[8:40] christ's name we pray
[8:42] amen you can have your seeds
[8:47] so we see that in the
[8:51] garden of eden god had only given one
[8:54] commandment to man
[8:56] and that commandment was given to man to
[8:58] warn him away
[8:59] from the consequences of partaking of
[9:01] that tree
[9:03] and and now under the
[9:07] temptation that the woman was facing
[9:09] with the serpent she began
[9:11] to reconsider the tree and to begin to
[9:13] look at it and she saw that it
[9:15] it really was good for food and that it
[9:18] was pleasant to the eyes
[9:19] and a tree desirable to make one wise i
[9:22] mean this was a wisdom that god didn't
[9:24] want her to have
[9:26] at least he didn't want her to have it
[9:27] at this time so
[9:29] she was she she was looking and she saw
[9:33] all the benefits but she failed she
[9:36] failed to remember the reason she wasn't
[9:39] supposed to eat it
[9:40] and the reason she wasn't supposed to
[9:41] eat it is because god said
[9:43] that the day you eat there of that day
[9:44] you die and the serpent
[9:46] put that very commandment in question
[9:48] saying you'll not surely die
[9:51] and she began to to look at it and then
[9:52] she partook of it and gave to her
[9:54] husband and
[9:54] he did eat also and their eyes were open
[9:58] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[10:00] and then we know when the god come
[10:02] walking in the cool of the evening then
[10:03] they begin to hide themselves so we know
[10:05] the story quite well
[10:06] by now but you realize that godhead in
[10:09] the garden of eden had
[10:10] perfect fellowship with his son and his
[10:13] son's wife
[10:14] and god was coming down in the cool of
[10:15] the evening to fellowship with his
[10:17] children
[10:18] and enjoying that fellowship and they
[10:20] were so enjoying it likewise
[10:22] and god wanted this fellowship god
[10:24] created eden to be this way
[10:26] he desired this kind of fellowship but
[10:29] as soon as they broke the commandment
[10:31] fellowship was broken and immediately
[10:34] religion began
[10:36] so you can see that religion begins with
[10:40] broken fellowship
[10:44] religion begins with broken fellowship
[10:46] because if you're in
[10:47] if you're in fellowship and relationship
[10:49] with god you don't need religion
[10:52] because religion is a covering amen and
[10:55] the religion that adam made was a
[10:57] covering to hide his sin
[10:59] and actually cause him to hide himself
[11:00] from the presence of the lord
[11:02] so you know religion became the barrier
[11:04] amen to being in the presence of god
[11:06] and it became a barrier to the
[11:08] relationship and now
[11:10] now god was going to have to come down
[11:13] in order to restore
[11:14] relationship restore the fellowship with
[11:16] his children
[11:17] he's going to have to slay an innocent
[11:19] lamb and he's going to have to give a
[11:20] blood sacrifice
[11:21] amen so he can clothe them in the skin
[11:23] so he can restore the fellowship back
[11:25] again
[11:26] because god wants the relationship
[11:29] not the religion so when the
[11:31] relationship was broken religion set in
[11:34] and so religion is a sign of broken
[11:36] relationship
[11:39] broken fellowship so religion is
[11:42] sold to people i say sold i mean i mean
[11:46] presented
[11:47] it's presented to people as a way to
[11:50] fellowship with god or to way to have a
[11:52] relationship with god
[11:53] but the very religion itself is a sign
[11:55] of broken relationship
[11:58] broken fellowship so we know that's not
[12:02] what god desires amen what god desires
[12:06] is fellowship with his children and
[12:08] that's what god has tried to restore in
[12:10] this day as a fellowship back to himself
[12:12] amen where he and you can be persons
[12:14] together amen
[12:16] and so we thank god for this but we see
[12:19] now
[12:20] that that adam and eve were placed on
[12:24] free moral agency they had free will
[12:26] they could choose whether they would
[12:27] take this tree or not take this tree
[12:29] god didn't fence off the tree he didn't
[12:31] have cherubims around the tree to
[12:33] prevent them from coming to the tree
[12:35] he gave them their choice you can
[12:37] partake of the tree of life
[12:38] or you can partake of the tree of
[12:40] knowledge of good and evil and they
[12:41] could choose which one they wanted to
[12:43] partake of
[12:44] because god set it up that way so there
[12:47] was free will
[12:48] so there was free choice but they were
[12:50] never to use
[12:51] free choice or free will to exercise
[12:54] self-will
[12:56] and that's what we see with the woman
[12:58] here when the woman began to analyze the
[13:00] tree and she began to question
[13:01] what god had said and began to look at
[13:03] the tree she begins to lust for these
[13:06] things and has
[13:07] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh the
[13:08] pride of life and as she begins lust
[13:10] begins to awaken inside of her
[13:12] her self-will begins to exercise and she
[13:15] protects
[13:16] she has free choice she has free will
[13:18] and she uses her
[13:20] free will to justify or to satisfy
[13:23] self-will
[13:28] amen and that's the trap of the devil is
[13:30] to use your free will
[13:31] to satisfy self-will
[13:34] in the message christ is the mystery of
[13:36] god revealed prophet of god says now oh
[13:38] the great revelation now how to restore
[13:41] back his kinship
[13:42] to bring back now he had to let them get
[13:45] lost you understand him
[13:46] he had to let them sin put them on free
[13:48] moral he
[13:49] he could not make them sin and remain
[13:51] god and then punish them for something
[13:53] he made them do
[13:54] but when he put man on partnership with
[13:56] him
[13:58] partnership with him then let man
[14:01] act as a free moral agency the same
[14:03] thing he's got you on today see
[14:06] you act any way you want to you're a
[14:09] free moral agent
[14:10] so therefore if he put the first like
[14:13] that he has to put the second like that
[14:15] he has put everyone like that or he
[14:17] acted wrong in the first place
[14:18] but everybody is on the same basis
[14:23] so when when god put man on partnership
[14:25] with him
[14:27] he made him a free moral agent so your
[14:28] free moral agency is putting you in
[14:30] partnership with god
[14:32] and you realize that god took his entire
[14:34] expression
[14:36] when he began to express himself he was
[14:39] going to build a masterpiece and this
[14:40] masterpiece was going to be a reflection
[14:42] of him
[14:43] because he was going to make man in his
[14:44] image
[14:46] and he made a beautiful setting to set
[14:47] the masterpiece and he said in in
[14:49] and in eddie put a garden in in the east
[14:52] in eden and then in there he placed his
[14:54] son and
[14:54] out of his son he pulled a rib and he
[14:56] made a wife a counterpart and he put the
[14:59] two together
[15:00] and he placed him in there and he said
[15:01] it is very good
[15:03] now he had finished his masterpiece the
[15:05] image that he had in his mind
[15:06] the desire of his heart he had made it
[15:08] and he had placed it
[15:09] and now he went and entered into his
[15:11] rest
[15:14] and that was god's desire amen
[15:17] and god put man on free moral agency in
[15:20] this
[15:20] so that man could continue to fellowship
[15:22] with god and express god
[15:24] and god said it that way because we know
[15:26] man had to fall because there was a plan
[15:27] of redemption
[15:28] god wanted to be a savior so god set him
[15:30] on free moral agency but he's never
[15:32] changed his plan
[15:33] he's kept us the same way but when god
[15:37] set this masterpiece in this garden of
[15:39] eden
[15:41] everything he created and everything he
[15:45] made and placed in position
[15:47] and all his delight and all his joy he
[15:50] placed
[15:52] in the hands of a man
[15:55] with free moral agency and when that man
[15:58] and his wife made the wrong choice
[16:00] and broke the commandment and brought
[16:02] death everything that god made his
[16:05] masterpiece and everything
[16:06] fell into ruin because god had placed it
[16:10] into the hands
[16:11] of his son so you see what power
[16:15] i'd say like this way what power is in
[16:18] free choice
[16:20] what power is in free moral agency that
[16:23] once
[16:23] god set man up in partnership with him
[16:26] and free moral as a free moral agent he
[16:27] could choose which way he wanted
[16:29] god was not going to prevent him from
[16:31] choosing the wrong tree
[16:32] he could choose and what power to take
[16:34] everything that god made
[16:36] and bring death into it and bring it
[16:37] into ruin and chaos and perversion
[16:39] by a choice of a man
[16:42] and we still are under this same free
[16:45] moral agency to make our choice
[16:50] in the message paradox he said you're on
[16:52] the same basis as adam and eve
[16:55] was you can if god put you on anything
[16:57] else it would be unjust to adam and eve
[17:00] each adam each adam and eve tonight has
[17:02] got the right and wrong setting before
[17:04] them
[17:05] you can make your choice you can take
[17:07] god's word or leave god's word
[17:09] you can take god's word or take your
[17:10] denominational creeds about him
[17:12] you can take your modernistic ideas of
[17:14] what it is
[17:15] you can be born again and filled with
[17:17] the holy ghost or you can be
[17:19] church-eyes either one you want to be
[17:22] but see there's a power when a son of
[17:24] god takes free moral agency and he
[17:26] begins to exert
[17:27] self-will there's still a power that
[17:29] comes with that
[17:30] amen there's still chaos that breaks out
[17:32] there's still destruction
[17:33] there's still perversion but there's got
[17:36] to be a people on the earth at the end
[17:38] time
[17:39] that are going to take the free moral
[17:40] agency and not use it
[17:42] not free will to exercise self-will but
[17:44] free will with the option to sacrifice
[17:47] self-will
[17:48] not by force but by free will by free
[17:51] moral agency
[17:52] if it was free choice that brought
[17:54] destruction it'll be free choice of the
[17:57] children of god that bring it back to a
[17:58] restoration
[18:01] there is power in this free moral agency
[18:05] when god has put us on partnership he
[18:07] put man on partnership with him
[18:08] and he hasn't taken away free moral
[18:10] agency the devil can still
[18:12] trip a son and daughter of god that son
[18:15] or daughter of god can still choose to
[18:17] walk away from the word and when that
[18:18] son or daughter of god chooses to walk
[18:20] away from the world
[18:21] a word is still brings the same results
[18:24] it brings death
[18:24] it brings destruction
[18:29] but we've been given amen by by the
[18:32] blood of jesus christ a path of
[18:33] redemption to come back in repentance
[18:37] but it still it still is a powerful
[18:40] thing
[18:42] i had a man that i i worked with one
[18:44] time he
[18:45] he told me he was getting a little bit
[18:48] hostile towards christianity and he
[18:50] didn't think that he believed in god
[18:52] and he and he said if if god is so good
[18:56] amen why does god allow children to be
[18:58] abused
[19:00] in murders and i don't know what all he
[19:02] cited but you know how it is you've
[19:03] heard the routine before
[19:04] if god is so good why does he do that
[19:07] and i looked at him
[19:09] i said you know god
[19:13] because man broke his covenant man has
[19:16] done this to himself
[19:17] god didn't do it when god made was
[19:19] perfect man did this
[19:22] and i said and the fact is i said when
[19:24] you yourself refuse to follow the word
[19:27] of god
[19:27] you're perpetuating the perversion and
[19:29] the murder and the child molestation
[19:31] it's your fault now not adam and eve and
[19:33] not gods
[19:36] everybody wants to look back and say oh
[19:38] you know i remember somebody smarted off
[19:40] one time and said when i get to heaven
[19:41] i'm going to talk to adam
[19:42] what about you today are you
[19:44] perpetuating what adam did
[19:46] are you continuing the cycle of
[19:49] destruction and defeat amen
[19:51] amen because in the seventh seal the
[19:53] prophet of god says that the devil can
[19:54] get one of his subjects to let down on
[19:56] one word he's got victory over the word
[19:58] of god
[20:00] amen but there's going to come a time he
[20:02] doesn't have victory over the word of
[20:04] god anymore
[20:05] because god is raising up a people who
[20:07] will use free will to surrender
[20:10] self-will
[20:13] so people want to get angry about what's
[20:15] going on but they don't want to
[20:16] obey god's word they want to talk about
[20:20] how horrible things are and how
[20:22] perverted and how
[20:23] but they don't realize the more you
[20:25] break the commandment of god the more
[20:27] you use free will
[20:28] amen to exercise self-will and so
[20:31] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[20:32] you are continuing to make the problem
[20:35] worse
[20:38] so we always want to blame somebody else
[20:40] but now it's our fault
[20:42] this is the day that we live in this is
[20:45] the time this is the hour
[20:47] and we have an opportunity now
[20:51] let's turn to second timothy chapter
[21:00] four
[21:11] ii timothy 4 and 2.
[21:16] just preach the word be instant in
[21:18] season out of season reprove rebuke
[21:21] exhort with all long-suffering and
[21:22] doctrine for the time will come when
[21:24] they will not endure
[21:25] sound doctrine but after their own lust
[21:28] shall they heap to themselves
[21:30] teachers having itching ears
[21:33] that means they want to satisfy the itch
[21:35] they want the teacher
[21:37] to give them something that they want to
[21:38] hear
[21:40] and they shall turn away their ears from
[21:41] truth and shall be turned
[21:43] unto fables you say oh what a horrible
[21:46] thing to happen no it's exactly what
[21:48] they wanted to happen
[21:50] this is what they're saying you know you
[21:51] say oh those poor people that are being
[21:53] deceived
[21:54] do you realize that a big giant portion
[21:57] of the people that are being deceived
[21:59] want to be deceived
[22:01] they've heaped to themselves teachers
[22:03] having itching ears they
[22:05] they are they're hearing what they want
[22:07] to hear they're hearing
[22:08] you're okay you're fine god loves you
[22:11] god would never this to you
[22:13] god would never that to you that's
[22:14] exactly what eve wanted to hear
[22:17] and when she began to hear that she
[22:18] began to consider what he was saying
[22:22] so they they they heaped to themselves
[22:24] teachers having
[22:26] itching ears and are turned from the
[22:27] truth unto fables and you say oh how sad
[22:30] they got exactly what they wanted they
[22:33] didn't want the truth
[22:34] they wanted to hear something amen that
[22:36] was appealing that would satisfy the
[22:38] self-will
[22:41] people many times people who get
[22:43] deceived are so willing to get deceived
[22:47] i mean that sounds horrible but if
[22:50] you've ever known of anybody that's been
[22:51] part of a pyramid scheme or a get rich
[22:53] quick scheme or
[22:55] some money making thing amen and you
[22:57] know maybe some of us have gotten
[22:59] trapped into that or
[23:00] segments of it or whatever but you
[23:02] realize
[23:03] at the end of the day you realize that
[23:05] the the picture that they painted wasn't
[23:07] the
[23:08] wasn't what we were getting amen i mean
[23:11] all of a sudden if you drink this juice
[23:13] you're going to be free of cancer and
[23:14] you're not going to have any
[23:15] heart problems you're not going to have
[23:16] this and if it works for you it'll work
[23:18] for your neighbor and you can sell it to
[23:20] your brother and your sister and your
[23:21] mother and your aunt
[23:22] and then you can have all yours free and
[23:24] if you really do a good job not only
[23:25] will you get your free you can get
[23:26] income
[23:27] and i know somebody over here he started
[23:29] this two years ago
[23:30] and this is his full-time job
[23:35] am i the only one who's ever heard a
[23:36] story like that
[23:41] it's phone cards and juices and vitamins
[23:44] and
[23:44] oils and whatever else
[23:48] and people jump in they jump in not
[23:52] because that juice
[23:53] has any property that changes anything
[23:56] they drink it and they feel
[23:57] great you know why they feel great
[24:00] because they're going to quit their job
[24:02] in a month
[24:04] and they're going to be independently
[24:06] wealthy and never need to work again
[24:07] not it's not the juice that's doing
[24:09] anything they have an itchy ear amen and
[24:11] they're willing to believe a fable
[24:13] because they want the fable to be true
[24:18] is that true and the next thing you know
[24:21] you can have a sweep through a church
[24:23] where everybody's trying to sell
[24:24] everybody their
[24:25] product can i have a show for you can i
[24:28] have no i've already she's having a show
[24:30] and i
[24:35] amen and what is it we
[24:39] we want it's the allure amen of
[24:42] satisfying the flesh
[24:44] of getting to quit work being
[24:46] financially independent
[24:47] not having to do this getting
[24:51] you see and then we're willing to really
[24:53] believe ridiculous things
[24:56] about this product that'll revolutionize
[24:58] and save my life and
[25:00] heal my whole family and whatever else
[25:03] it's supposed to do
[25:05] and see without any and without any real
[25:08] proof without any real evidence
[25:09] we'll latch onto something like that
[25:11] because human beings
[25:13] fundamentally at the core are all the
[25:15] same
[25:17] and these things work over and over and
[25:19] over again they'll just change the
[25:21] product they'll change the
[25:22] some of the terminology but it'll be the
[25:24] same thing amen
[25:25] it's just the same thing over and over
[25:26] again because what happens is
[25:29] the allurement of satisfaction of the
[25:32] flesh
[25:32] amen of fulfilling the lust of the eyes
[25:34] the lust of the flesh
[25:35] and the pride of life will cause us amen
[25:38] to believe
[25:39] something that's nonsense
[25:43] because we want it to be true because i
[25:46] want the reward that they're promising
[25:49] and if it works for a money-making
[25:51] scheme it's the same exact tactic in
[25:53] religion amen
[25:55] they want to be okay they want to be
[25:57] able to live any way they want
[25:58] amen run up into this tower sing with
[26:01] the angels let the judgment pass
[26:02] and come back out of the tower
[26:06] they want the religion they want the
[26:08] religion to work
[26:15] you know all you have to do is come and
[26:18] take communion
[26:19] and if you take communion that's been
[26:20] blessed a certain way you're now part of
[26:22] the body of christ and christ is in you
[26:24] and if you'll come to the confession
[26:26] booth and tell a man your sin and then
[26:28] you'll do what he says as far as so many
[26:30] rosary be so many this so many that
[26:31] then your sins will all be forgiven you
[26:33] amen it's not biblical
[26:35] it's absolute nonsense but they want it
[26:37] to be true
[26:46] and eve now wanted this to be true
[26:53] and millions have wanted it to be true
[26:56] so they've heaped to themselves teachers
[26:58] having itchy ears
[27:00] and turned the truth into a fable and
[27:02] they liked the fable better than the
[27:04] truth
[27:07] but praise god he's got a predestinated
[27:10] seed
[27:13] brother ma'am said lot as he had to make
[27:16] a choice
[27:17] abraham give lot his choice and god
[27:20] gives you your choice
[27:21] choose you this day who you shall serve
[27:23] in the garden of eden there was a tree
[27:25] of knowledge and a tree of life
[27:27] man was given the privilege to choose
[27:28] either one he desired and so is it today
[27:31] you're given your privilege as a free
[27:32] moral agent
[27:33] to choose whatever you want to choose
[27:38] praise god let's turn to the book of
[27:46] esther
[27:54] if i've been given a free moral agency
[27:59] if i've been given the right to choose
[28:03] i want to be careful how i exercise my
[28:05] right to choose
[28:08] because god's not going to take that
[28:10] away
[28:12] and so i i want to be very careful
[28:16] i'd like to look here at the story of
[28:18] esther esther chapter 2 verse 3.
[28:26] and let the king appoint officers in all
[28:28] the provinces of his kingdom
[28:30] that they may gather together all the
[28:32] fair young virgins unto shushen the
[28:34] palace to the house of the women
[28:36] unto the custody of hagie the king's
[28:38] chamberlain keeper of the women
[28:40] and let their things for purification be
[28:42] given them and let the maiden which
[28:44] pleaseth the king be queen instead of
[28:46] vashti
[28:47] and the thing pleased the king and he
[28:50] did so
[28:51] so we find out there's a decree going
[28:53] out vashti we know had refused to come
[28:56] to the king's bidden
[28:57] bidding she had a feast she was having
[29:00] her own feast when the king was having a
[29:02] feast she was having her own feast
[29:03] the feast of the women amen and vastly
[29:06] is a type of the catholic church and
[29:07] she's there with all the women the
[29:08] denominations they're having their own
[29:10] feasts
[29:11] and won't come to the king's feast
[29:14] but there's a king's feast going on
[29:16] today friends and you're bidding to come
[29:18] to the king's feast
[29:19] but vashti and all the women has refused
[29:22] keeping their own feast of the world
[29:23] council churches and
[29:25] and all of that nonsense but now he's
[29:28] going to
[29:28] he's going to send out a decree to
[29:30] gather the fair young virgins because
[29:31] he's going to find
[29:33] going to find one but but they said let
[29:36] the maiden which
[29:37] pleaseth the king be queen instead of
[29:40] vashti
[29:41] all this is so important they weren't
[29:44] looking
[29:45] for the most beautiful the most
[29:48] intelligent
[29:49] the most talented they were going to
[29:52] begin looking for the maiden that
[29:53] pleaseth the king
[29:56] amen and that's what god is doing today
[29:58] he's gathering the maiden that pleaseth
[30:00] the king amen
[30:02] because there's one person that needed
[30:03] to be pleased in all of this
[30:05] and that was the king
[30:10] let's go look at verse 12.
[30:15] now when every maid's turn was come to
[30:17] go into king azaris after that she had
[30:20] been 12 months according to the manner
[30:22] of the women
[30:23] for so were the days of their
[30:24] purifications
[30:26] accomplished to whit six months with oil
[30:28] of myrrh
[30:29] and six months with sweet odors and with
[30:32] other things for the purification
[30:34] of the women then thus came
[30:37] every maiden to the king whatsoever she
[30:40] desired
[30:40] was given her to go with her out of the
[30:43] house of the women
[30:44] unto the king's house so in verse 13
[30:48] you can see that now they're they've
[30:50] been they went through a 12-month
[30:52] purification process
[30:54] six months of merch six months of aloes
[30:56] and spices and
[30:57] and fragrances and now they're going to
[31:00] get to go one by one
[31:01] and present themselves and to the king
[31:04] and as they go
[31:06] they're given free moral agency they're
[31:08] given free choice
[31:11] thus came every maiden to the king
[31:12] whatsoever she desired
[31:15] was given her to go with her out of the
[31:17] house of the women
[31:18] and to the king's house whatever she
[31:21] wanted to take
[31:22] she could take whatever she thought
[31:25] amen would be appropriate whatever she
[31:28] thought
[31:28] would be for beautification or for
[31:30] presentation whatever
[31:32] she thought whatever she desired
[31:35] she was able to take it it was given to
[31:37] her for her night when she went
[31:39] and present herself to the king so i
[31:42] want you to see
[31:44] these maidens were given free choice
[31:47] they could take whatever they desired
[31:50] whatever they thought whatever they felt
[31:52] like would be the best thing
[31:55] and it was a test we're going to find in
[31:58] the scriptures that it's a test
[32:01] verse 14 in the evening she went and on
[32:04] the morrow she returned to the second
[32:06] house of the women
[32:07] to the custody of shasgas the king's
[32:09] chamberlain
[32:10] which kept the concubine she came in
[32:12] unto the king no more
[32:14] except the king delighted in her and
[32:16] that she recalled by name
[32:18] now when the turn of esther the daughter
[32:20] of abigail the uncle of mordecai
[32:22] who had taken her for his daughter was
[32:24] come to go into the king
[32:25] she required nothing but what haggai the
[32:29] king's chamberlain the keeper of the
[32:30] women
[32:31] appointed haggai is a type of the
[32:34] prophet of the age brother branham amen
[32:36] as he prepares
[32:37] the bride to go in to meet the king and
[32:39] now
[32:40] under the purification amen all of these
[32:43] virgins now they're going to go and
[32:44] present themselves
[32:45] now remember they're all virgins
[32:49] they're all virgins there's been 10
[32:52] virgins amen
[32:54] they're all virgins they're going to
[32:55] present themselves to the king and
[32:57] they're given
[32:58] free choice free will to take whatever
[33:01] they desired would be given to them
[33:03] to take before the king amen to dress
[33:06] the way they wanted to dress the perfume
[33:07] the whatever
[33:08] whatever it was that they were going to
[33:10] do to present themselves to king
[33:12] they could do it of their own will
[33:15] but when esther came she required
[33:18] nothing but what that prophet told her
[33:21] was the right garment to wear
[33:24] because this prophet this haggai in this
[33:27] generation
[33:27] amen he's been here to watch over the
[33:30] purification of the virgins he's been
[33:32] here to make sure they were presented
[33:33] right
[33:34] and he's been here to instruct you amen
[33:36] to instruct you and he says
[33:38] he says he's going to take he said let
[33:40] this be the crowning of my ministry
[33:41] to take the cloth of the word and clothe
[33:43] the bride
[33:46] and he's given us for our clothing the
[33:48] word amen we've been adorned by the word
[33:50] of god
[33:51] we've been dressed by the correct
[33:52] teaching amen the restoration of the
[33:55] truth
[33:55] amen but all of these virgins they can
[33:57] take before the king
[33:59] anything their heart desires whatsoever
[34:01] they desire
[34:02] it was given to them but there was one
[34:05] little virgin that didn't want anything
[34:07] other than what that prophet said
[34:09] she didn't want her own thinking she
[34:10] didn't want her own mind she didn't want
[34:12] to
[34:12] make it prettier she didn't want to make
[34:14] it smell nicer
[34:17] because there was a secret with haggai
[34:20] and esther was able to catch the secret
[34:22] the secret was none of these virgins had
[34:25] been
[34:25] to the inner chamber with the king
[34:27] before but haggai
[34:29] knew the king haggai knew what the king
[34:32] liked
[34:32] haggy haggai knew the desires of the
[34:34] king amen and there was one virgin
[34:36] amongst all the virgin
[34:38] that recognized he knows what he's
[34:40] talking about
[34:43] my own idea is worthless i don't know
[34:46] what i'm talking about but there was a
[34:47] prophet who was able to tap
[34:49] into the back part of god's mind and
[34:51] knows what god has been looking for
[34:53] he could tell us what the heart desire
[34:55] of god has been
[34:56] all along and that's to have a bride of
[34:58] his own choosing
[35:04] and there was a test and the test was
[35:08] you can take anything you want
[35:11] you could just imagine what was at their
[35:14] disposal
[35:17] if you can just imagine if they had 12
[35:19] months of purifications with all these
[35:21] uh myrrh and aloes and all these spices
[35:23] and all this
[35:24] and then they had they i mean esther
[35:26] alone was given seven maidens to help
[35:28] in her preparation could you imagine
[35:32] what was available
[35:34] it was a modern laodicea
[35:39] anything you want
[35:42] is here
[35:46] anything your heart desires
[35:49] is available you can watch anything look
[35:53] at anything learn anything
[35:55] nearly buy anything whatever you want
[35:58] it's here whatever
[36:02] flavor you want to worship god in
[36:06] if you want it legalistic you can have
[36:08] it if you want it liberal you can have
[36:10] it
[36:10] if you want it loud and exciting you can
[36:12] have it if you want it still in quiet
[36:14] you can have it you can have it any
[36:16] flavor you want
[36:20] any doctrine you want you can have it
[36:24] so what will you choose these virgins
[36:27] were
[36:28] going in and they were going back to the
[36:30] house of the concubines
[36:33] but there was one that would go and when
[36:35] she presented herself to the king
[36:36] it stopped right there let's read
[36:40] this
[36:45] now when the turn verse 15 again when
[36:47] the turn of esther the daughter of
[36:48] abigail the uncle of mordecai
[36:51] who had taken her for her daughter was
[36:52] come to go into the king she required
[36:54] nothing but what haggai the king's
[36:56] chamberlain the keeper of the woman
[36:57] appointed
[36:58] keeper of the women appointed and esther
[37:00] obtained favor in the sight of all them
[37:03] that looked
[37:04] upon her she did not
[37:07] adorn herself with her own desire
[37:10] or her own thinking whatsoever she
[37:13] exerted
[37:13] none of her own will she used her free
[37:16] choice to do she used her free choice
[37:20] to deny herself will and take what hegei
[37:22] i said
[37:27] esther obtained favor in the sight of
[37:28] them all all that looked upon her
[37:31] i would say there's no way to dress this
[37:34] bride better than heggy eye has said to
[37:36] dress this bride
[37:37] all that saw her they marveled all that
[37:39] saw her looked upon her
[37:41] and she found favor with all of them
[37:43] amen it didn't say this of any of the
[37:44] other virgins that took whatever they
[37:46] desired
[37:47] they were piecing together whatever they
[37:48] thought oh i think he'll like this and i
[37:50] think that will be all right and i think
[37:52] this and i think that
[37:53] then all she was doing was dressing
[37:55] herself the way she
[37:56] liked to be dressed because she didn't
[38:00] know the king she hadn't met the king
[38:04] she didn't know what the king wanted the
[38:05] only way she would know what the king
[38:07] wanted was to get it from haggai
[38:08] but these virgins weren't listening to
[38:10] haggai they were over here dabbling with
[38:12] their own desire
[38:13] their own will their own lust and i'd
[38:16] like to wear pearls and i think i'd like
[38:17] to have my hair this way and i think
[38:19] this perfume is nice and i
[38:24] i think this will be all right do i look
[38:26] good
[38:27] who are you asking hacky eye or another
[38:29] virgin that doesn't have a clue
[38:31] what the king wants
[38:35] this is okay don't you think this looks
[38:36] good
[38:38] who are you asking
[38:40] [Music]
[38:42] amen but haggy i knew
[38:46] what the king was after haggy i knew i
[38:49] mean he had seen vashti
[38:50] he had seen the court he had knew what
[38:52] went on there hey man he
[38:53] understood and now esther she doesn't
[38:56] have
[38:56] any of her own thinking she doesn't
[38:58] exercise any of her free choice
[39:00] for her own will she surrenders her will
[39:03] to what haggy i instructed
[39:04] and when she surrenders and submits to
[39:07] the leadership
[39:07] that she's been placed under when she
[39:09] presents herself to the king
[39:11] the king says that's the one i want
[39:18] it goes on to say so esther was taking
[39:21] it to the king ahazeras
[39:23] verse 16 unto his house royal in the
[39:25] 10th month
[39:26] which is the month tibeth in the seventh
[39:28] year she goes in and 10-7
[39:32] in the seventh year of his reign
[39:36] and the king loved esther above all the
[39:38] women and she obtained grace and favor
[39:40] in his sight
[39:41] more than all the virgins so that he set
[39:44] the royal crown upon her head
[39:45] and made her queen instead of vashti
[39:49] what was it he loved he loved somebody
[39:52] who could choose whatever they wanted to
[39:53] choose
[39:54] and she would choose what would be
[39:56] pleasing to the king because remember
[39:57] the decree went out and said let
[39:59] the virgin that please the king be queen
[40:02] instead of vashti
[40:03] and every other virgin had come before
[40:05] esther wasn't pleasing the king
[40:07] she was pleasing herself
[40:10] or her friends
[40:16] how many churches are trying to impress
[40:19] other churches
[40:25] how many are trying to out sing out
[40:27] preach outperform
[40:29] out member
[40:32] do you think there wasn't competition
[40:34] amongst those virgins
[40:39] i mean the one who leaves you know and
[40:41] her hair is just out of place in the
[40:43] back nobody else is telling her that
[40:47] my turn's tomorrow night
[40:51] you see what i'm saying friends
[40:54] and all these no matter you know the
[40:58] world is the world is the world and
[40:59] people as people as people
[41:02] i'd ask you if we did the same kind of
[41:04] pageant today and gathered all the fair
[41:07] young virgins and said you're going to
[41:08] be queen
[41:09] over a vast empire one of the vastest
[41:11] that's ever been on the face of the
[41:12] earth
[41:12] with all the riches and all that go with
[41:14] it i mean you've got to go through this
[41:15] purification process you'll be given
[41:17] everything you'll be weighted on hand
[41:18] and foot and you can take anything you
[41:20] want to the king
[41:21] what do you think that house would be
[41:23] like
[41:24] how much backbiting and whispering and
[41:26] murmuring and
[41:31] i mean i'm not trying to be mean against
[41:32] women but
[41:35] these worldly women they're in
[41:37] competition with each other
[41:39] trying to out beautify outperform be the
[41:42] next one
[41:43] and they're in competition with each
[41:45] other but they're not worried about
[41:47] pleasing the king
[41:48] they're just trying to compete with one
[41:49] another
[41:52] i say god help us to never get into a
[41:55] rut like that
[41:56] amen let's listen to what haggai said
[41:58] haggai knows what the king wants
[42:00] let's surrender our will you can have
[42:02] anything you want i don't want anything
[42:04] i want to be pleasing to that king
[42:06] because the only way that i'm going to
[42:08] get the crown
[42:08] and i'm going to get the title is if i'm
[42:10] pleasing to him
[42:13] so all the other virgins go out pleasing
[42:15] themselves satisfying themselves
[42:17] competing and trying to outdo one of the
[42:19] other virgins and they all come
[42:21] and they all go and they come and they
[42:23] go and they come and they go but when
[42:25] esther stepped forth who required
[42:27] nothing but what haggai had required had
[42:31] appointed
[42:32] she didn't put anything extra on the
[42:35] message
[42:37] she didn't add to it she didn't doctor
[42:39] up the word she didn't add to the
[42:41] message
[42:41] she didn't make it nicer she didn't make
[42:43] it prettier she didn't make it smell
[42:45] better
[42:45] she just took exactly what haggai
[42:47] appointed
[42:49] and when she stepped forth she found
[42:51] favor in the eyes of
[42:52] everyone
[42:56] because that was real beauty and the
[42:58] real beauty of esther was not her skin
[43:00] the real beauty of esther was her
[43:02] character because
[43:03] he had the king azares had beauty
[43:07] because vashti was stunning when he
[43:10] called for vastu to come
[43:11] he called for her so that she might
[43:13] present herself so that all can look
[43:15] upon her beauty
[43:17] he already had beauty amen do you think
[43:19] you're going to out glitter the catholic
[43:21] church
[43:25] but there's a certain glow that comes
[43:26] with character
[43:29] and what esther had was far above
[43:32] what vashti had and what these other
[43:34] virgins said
[43:37] so esther exercised
[43:40] her free will to surrender
[43:44] all self-will and in exercising her free
[43:48] will to surrender self-will
[43:51] she was pleasing to the king and she was
[43:54] positioned as queen
[43:56] instead of asking this is why brother
[43:59] branham says the way up is down
[44:02] everybody else was trying so hard all
[44:05] she did was what haggai said
[44:11] brother brahm says
[44:14] in the god of this evil age he said the
[44:16] outside man is a physical being which is
[44:18] controlled by six senses
[44:20] or five senses rather the inside man is
[44:22] a spirit man which is controlled by five
[44:24] senses conscience and love and so forth
[44:26] the outside man see tastes feel smell
[44:28] here but the inside of that spirit is a
[44:30] soul when it's controlled by one thing
[44:32] your free will you can accept what the
[44:35] devil says or accept what god says
[44:37] and that'll determine what spirit is in
[44:39] there if it's in the spirit of god it'll
[44:41] feed on the things of god and it won't
[44:42] feed on anything of the world
[44:44] jesus said if you love the world or the
[44:46] things of the world
[44:47] it's because the love of god is not even
[44:49] entered into the inner part
[44:51] satan has deceived you and a man shall
[44:53] not live by bread alone
[44:54] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[44:56] the mouth of god
[44:58] turn with me to isaiah 14.
[45:03] we've read this recently but i'd like to
[45:05] pick it up again right here
[45:08] isaiah 14.
[45:14] in verse 12.
[45:21] isaiah 14 12 how art thou fallen from
[45:24] heaven a lucifer son of the morning
[45:26] howarth thou cut down to the ground
[45:27] which is weak in the nations
[45:29] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[45:31] ascend
[45:32] i will self-will
[45:37] see lucifer also was had a free choice
[45:40] is that right he chose to rebel
[45:44] and so did his angels with him thou has
[45:46] said in thine heart i will ascend unto
[45:48] heaven
[45:49] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[45:50] of god i will sit also upon the mount of
[45:53] the congregation
[45:54] and the sides of the north i will ascend
[45:55] above the heights of the clouds
[45:57] i will be like the most high yet thou
[45:59] shall be brought down to hell
[46:01] to the sides of the pit that expression
[46:05] of self-will
[46:06] amen against the will of god it comes
[46:08] right from lucifer it's an attribute of
[46:10] the devil himself
[46:13] but esther never had that
[46:16] in the message christ is the mystery of
[46:18] god revealed there's another one the
[46:19] night if you didn't get the tape
[46:22] i preached here one night on a prisoner
[46:23] of jesus christ paul a prisoner see
[46:26] when god gets you to be his prisoner
[46:28] then you can't do nothing but what the
[46:29] spirit says do
[46:31] paul with all of his great intellects he
[46:34] he was taught by gamaliel
[46:36] to be a great priest or rabbi someday
[46:38] and he had high ambitions he was
[46:39] intellectual great man
[46:41] great authority great man in the nation
[46:43] but he had to sacrifice
[46:45] every bit of it see to become part of
[46:47] the word
[46:48] to express jesus christ he knowed what
[46:50] it was to say he had a notion to go over
[46:52] someplace some some brethren had called
[46:54] him but he was forbidden by the spirit
[46:56] to do his own will
[46:57] oh if people half spiritual can pick
[46:59] that up see he was forbidden to do his
[47:02] own will
[47:02] he could only the spirit forbid me see
[47:05] he was a prisoner to christ
[47:07] then this little fortune teller one day
[47:09] who he knowed paul knowed he had power
[47:11] to cast that devil out
[47:14] she was tormenting him following him
[47:17] around the city
[47:19] crying these men be sent from god and it
[47:21] was it was a burdensome it was a bother
[47:23] to paul
[47:24] and he knew that he had the power to
[47:26] cast that devil out but he couldn't do
[47:27] it unless god said do it
[47:30] see lucifer wanted to exert his own will
[47:33] but paul learned to surrender his will
[47:35] to the will of god
[47:38] but he could only do it as god willed it
[47:40] day after day she followed him crying
[47:42] out after him but one day
[47:43] the spirit gave him permission then he
[47:45] rebuked her the spirit that was in there
[47:47] see
[47:48] he knowed what it was to be a prisoner
[47:52] when paul thought that he had authority
[47:54] and he thought that he had power
[47:56] when he had letters from the high priest
[47:58] to persecute the children of god
[48:00] and he did have a realm of power and
[48:02] uncertain authority and he could
[48:04] haul them to prison and even have them
[48:06] beaten all kinds of things
[48:09] but god that was a false authority that
[48:12] was a false power
[48:14] but god was going to bring him to a real
[48:16] power and a real authority as the
[48:17] apostle of god
[48:18] and the apostle to the gentiles but he
[48:20] was going to have to surrender
[48:22] everything and die out and exercise his
[48:24] free will to give
[48:26] up exercises free choice to give up all
[48:28] self-will
[48:29] and when he did god would take him after
[48:31] he was a base
[48:32] and god would lift him up now in his
[48:34] hands and he would have real power and
[48:36] real authority and real jurisdiction
[48:40] in the kingdom of god paul thought he
[48:43] was fighting for the kingdom of god he
[48:44] thought he had a position in power in
[48:46] the kingdom of god but he didn't realize
[48:48] he was fighting god
[48:50] but when he surrendered all then he
[48:53] found
[48:54] jurisdiction and power and authority
[48:57] in the kingdom of god let's turn to
[49:01] back to genesis and go to genesis
[49:03] chapter 13.
[49:23] genesis 13-5
[49:27] and lot also which went with abram had
[49:29] flocks and herds and tents
[49:32] and the land was not able to bear them
[49:33] that they might dwell together for their
[49:35] substance was great so that they could
[49:36] not dwell together
[49:38] and there was a strife between the
[49:40] herdmen of abram's cattle and the
[49:41] herdmen of lot's cattle
[49:43] the canaanite and the parasite dwell in
[49:44] the then in the land
[49:47] and abram said unto lot let there be no
[49:49] strife i pray thee between me and thee
[49:51] and between my herdmen and thy herdmen
[49:53] for we be brethren
[49:55] is not the whole land before thee
[49:57] separate thyself i pray thee from me
[50:00] if thou will take the left hand then i
[50:01] will go to the right if
[50:03] and if thou depart to the right hand
[50:05] then i will go to the left
[50:06] and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld
[50:09] all the plane of jordan
[50:11] and it was well watered everywhere
[50:13] before the lord destroyed sodom and
[50:15] gomorrah
[50:16] even as the garden of the lord liked the
[50:18] land of egypt
[50:19] as thou comest and zazar then lot chose
[50:22] him all the plain of jordan and lot
[50:24] journeyed east and they separated
[50:26] themselves the one from the other
[50:29] abram dwelled in the land of canaan and
[50:30] lot dwelt in the in the cities of the
[50:32] plain and pitched his tent towards sodom
[50:35] but the men of sodom were wicked and
[50:37] sinners before the lord
[50:38] exceedingly it comes down to a decision
[50:43] to a choice
[50:46] abraham abram mentions the law no let's
[50:49] not have strife
[50:51] the land can't bear us you pick which
[50:53] way you want to go
[50:54] and now lot he doesn't consider god he
[50:57] doesn't
[50:58] he doesn't pray amen he's willing to
[51:01] separate from abraham who is the chosen
[51:03] and elect of god
[51:04] and how does he make his choice he makes
[51:07] his choice by looking for what's the
[51:08] most beautiful what's the most
[51:10] well-watered
[51:11] where can he have the easiest life and
[51:13] where can he benefit the most
[51:18] i wonder how many times we make choices
[51:20] that way
[51:24] looking out but you know when he looked
[51:26] out and he said he looked out and he saw
[51:28] the planes and he saw this and
[51:30] they had journeyed in the land for some
[51:31] time they knew the cities they knew the
[51:33] people
[51:34] they knew the conditions amen in this in
[51:36] and the bible says
[51:38] that the men of sodom were exceedingly
[51:40] wicked
[51:42] and lot knew it already
[51:46] but he was willing to go down there near
[51:49] that city
[51:50] because it was well watered because it
[51:52] would produce
[51:53] good you know good good for his flocks
[51:55] and good crops
[51:56] he could benefit from all of those
[51:58] things he was willing amen to leave the
[52:01] plane
[52:01] to leave separation and mingle down into
[52:04] the world and move his tit
[52:06] towards sodom for personal gain and
[52:09] personal
[52:09] carnal benefits
[52:14] he had free choice we have free choice
[52:19] but how many people have chosen
[52:22] a carnal choice for benefit
[52:25] and blessing over staying separated to
[52:29] the word of god
[52:32] better job in a place that takes me from
[52:35] church
[52:36] a better job that will move me to a
[52:38] place amen that there's no good church
[52:40] no local church no no place to
[52:42] fellowship no believers of fellowship
[52:44] or will just take me away from the house
[52:46] of god because of the schedule
[52:50] but when you look we see it's well
[52:52] watered and it's got a good place for
[52:53] cattle it's nice this and nice that
[52:55] and it's nice that you say butt butt
[52:57] butt
[52:59] he already knew that they were
[53:01] exceedingly wicked
[53:03] in sodom and he ends up losing some of
[53:07] his children
[53:08] in sodom because he wanted
[53:11] self-will he wanted personal gain
[53:16] we need to analyze our decisions
[53:18] sometimes
[53:20] why do we make the choices we make why
[53:23] did we decide to do this
[53:24] amen we have a right for free choice
[53:27] absolutely god's given you that right
[53:29] you can make free choice but why do we
[53:31] make the decisions we make do we make it
[53:33] because of what haggai said or do we
[53:35] make it because of what i want
[53:39] we can all say amen because we're
[53:41] equally guilty
[53:44] there's a carnality there's a carnal
[53:47] side that wants to be
[53:48] comforted and wants to be well taken
[53:50] care of and wants to benefit and profit
[53:53] and have an easier life and all these
[53:55] other things and we've got to be careful
[53:57] about why we make the decisions we make
[53:59] and really analyze our decisions and say
[54:02] why am i doing this what am i presenting
[54:04] am i trying i mean am i trying to
[54:06] preserve myself
[54:07] or am i laying my life down for for him
[54:10] so i can be pleasing to him
[54:15] that's why brother branham said he could
[54:17] change his doctrine sure and he could
[54:18] have big crowds and he could have an
[54:20] easier way to go
[54:22] but he told us i would rather eat soda
[54:25] crackers and drink branch water
[54:28] and be right with the lord
[54:31] so i think it behooves us sometimes
[54:34] because we have a right
[54:36] a free choice that we analyze our
[54:38] choices
[54:39] and we line them to the word and we
[54:41] remember what haggy i said
[54:43] what did haggai say about this what is
[54:46] pleasing to the king
[54:48] how does the king want my hair
[54:52] what did he say was the fragrance that i
[54:54] should take
[54:57] what color did haggy i say
[55:01] i remember that one day we were walking
[55:03] along and haggai told me he said
[55:06] wear that ribbon when you go see the
[55:08] king
[55:12] and esther might have been like i
[55:13] wouldn't have picked that ribbon
[55:17] but whatever you say because you know
[55:23] i think we need to be more careful about
[55:25] our decisions
[55:29] because there's a relationship at stake
[55:33] all of these women they were going to
[55:35] have an opportunity to have a
[55:36] relationship with the king
[55:38] like few could have to be his queen
[55:41] but they were so interested in
[55:44] satisfying themselves they all missed
[55:46] out on the relationship
[55:47] but the one who would not satisfy
[55:49] herself was the one
[55:51] who had the relationship and the
[55:52] relationship would
[55:54] would equal salvation for her people
[56:02] these things are important
[56:05] the devil is no less wily today than he
[56:08] was when he spoke to
[56:10] eve through the serpent he tripped her
[56:14] up
[56:15] by her own lusts and he tries to trip
[56:18] us up by our own lusts
[56:22] let's turn to first kings
[56:35] first kings 18.
[56:42] first kings 18 and in verse chapter 18
[56:45] verse 21
[56:48] and elijah came unto all the people and
[56:51] said how long halt you between two
[56:52] opinions
[56:54] if the lord be god follow him but of
[56:56] baal then follow
[56:58] him and the people would answered him
[57:00] not a word
[57:02] i think this is interesting elijah's
[57:04] bringing him to a showdown he's bringing
[57:06] them to a meeting place
[57:07] and you can see here that the problem in
[57:09] israel is a blended religion it's a
[57:11] mixing
[57:12] because he says you're halting between
[57:13] two opinions you're not saying jehovah's
[57:15] god you're not saying barolo's god
[57:16] you're serving both
[57:19] and he's trying to bring him down to a
[57:20] decision amen
[57:22] because in the time that elijah is going
[57:24] to appear for a mount carmel showdown in
[57:26] the end time
[57:27] there's going to be a mixture amen of
[57:29] idolatry and christianity
[57:32] there's going to be a blending of
[57:33] religion amen a man-made religion with
[57:36] the word of god a hybridization
[57:38] amen and elijah's going to bring it to a
[57:40] question amen
[57:41] are you going to serve jehovah are you
[57:42] going to serve baal
[57:44] you decide you pick and they said
[57:46] nothing
[57:48] they didn't want to pick they didn't
[57:51] want to choose
[57:53] they wanted to stay right there
[57:56] and the message the marriage of the lamb
[57:58] probably says so many says that the lord
[58:00] will take this evil spirit from me
[58:02] from drinking or from gambling or from
[58:04] lying or stealing
[58:05] i'll serve him but that's up to you
[58:10] you've got to do something too they that
[58:12] overcome shall inherit all things they
[58:14] that overcome you have power to do it
[58:16] but you must be willing to lay it down
[58:18] see she has made herself ready i like
[58:20] that worm
[58:21] you see god could not push us through a
[58:23] little pipe pull us out on the other end
[58:25] and then say blessings blessed is he
[58:27] that overcometh
[58:28] you had nothing to overcome he just
[58:30] pushed you through
[58:31] but you've got to make decisions for
[58:34] yourself
[58:35] i have to make decisions for myself in
[58:37] doing that we show our faith
[58:39] and respects to god
[58:42] the decisions we make shows our faith
[58:45] and respects
[58:46] to god
[58:49] let's turn to joshua 24.
[58:59] and verse 14.
[59:06] joshua 24-14 now therefore fear the lord
[59:10] and serve him in the sincerity and truth
[59:12] and put away the gods
[59:14] which your father served on the other
[59:16] side of the flood and in egypt
[59:18] and serve ye the lord and if it's him
[59:20] evil unto you to serve the lord choose
[59:22] you this day whom you will serve
[59:24] whether the gods which your father
[59:25] served that were on the other side of
[59:28] the flood or the gods of the amorites in
[59:30] whose land you dwell
[59:32] but as for me and my house we will serve
[59:35] the lord joshua was bringing it down to
[59:38] a decision because you've got to make a
[59:40] decision
[59:41] amen and joshua wasn't waiting to see
[59:43] what they decided he was telling them up
[59:45] front what he decided
[59:47] he said you choose are you going to
[59:49] serve the gods with your father served
[59:51] up in egypt
[59:51] you're going to serve the gods in the
[59:53] lands of the amorites are you going to
[59:54] serve jehovah
[59:55] amen you pick but he said i'm not
[59:57] waiting for you to decide
[59:59] i'm telling you what i already decided
[1:00:01] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:00:03] lord
[1:00:05] that's the way we have to make our
[1:00:06] decision in elijah's day when elijah was
[1:00:08] telling them to make their decision
[1:00:10] they didn't say a word they were going
[1:00:11] to wait and see how the showdown went
[1:00:15] and after and after the fire came down
[1:00:18] and licked up the water and consumed the
[1:00:20] stones and consumed everything
[1:00:21] then they chased down the prophets of
[1:00:23] baal and helped elijah kill them amen
[1:00:25] but they didn't say anything before
[1:00:30] i say now is the time to make our
[1:00:32] decision
[1:00:34] not later but now
[1:00:37] let's turn to genesis 24 now
[1:00:53] genesis 24
[1:00:57] and 10.
[1:01:05] this is leaser going to fetch a bride
[1:01:08] for isaac
[1:01:09] in verse 10 he says and the servant took
[1:01:12] ten camels
[1:01:13] of the camels of his master and departed
[1:01:15] for all the goods
[1:01:17] of his master were in his hand and he
[1:01:19] arose and went to mesopotamia into the
[1:01:21] city of nehor
[1:01:23] and he made his camels to kneel down
[1:01:24] without the city by a well of water at
[1:01:26] the time of the evening
[1:01:28] even the time that the women go out to
[1:01:30] draw water
[1:01:32] he said o lord god of my master abraham
[1:01:34] i pray thee send me good speed this day
[1:01:36] and show kindness unto my
[1:01:38] master abraham behold i stand here by
[1:01:40] the well of water
[1:01:41] and the daughters of the men of the city
[1:01:43] come out to draw water
[1:01:44] and let it come to pass that the damsel
[1:01:46] to whom i shall say let down my picture
[1:01:49] i pray thee that i may drink and she
[1:01:52] shall say
[1:01:53] shall say drink and i will give thy
[1:01:55] camel's drink also
[1:01:56] let the same be she that thou has
[1:01:59] appointed for thy servant isaac
[1:02:01] and thereby shall i know that thou has
[1:02:03] showed kindness
[1:02:04] unto my master and it came to pass
[1:02:07] before
[1:02:08] he had done speaking that behold rebecca
[1:02:10] came out
[1:02:11] which was born of bethul son of milk of
[1:02:13] the wife of nehorn
[1:02:15] abram's abraham's brother with her
[1:02:17] picture upon her shoulder
[1:02:19] and the damsel was very fair to look
[1:02:21] upon a virgin neither had any man known
[1:02:23] her
[1:02:23] and she went down to the well and filled
[1:02:25] her picture and came up
[1:02:27] and the servant ran to meet her and said
[1:02:29] let me i pray thee drink a little water
[1:02:31] out of that pitcher
[1:02:32] she said drink my lord and she hasted
[1:02:34] and let down her picture upon her hand
[1:02:36] and gave him drink
[1:02:38] and when she had done give him drink she
[1:02:40] said i will draw water for the camels
[1:02:42] also until they have done drinking
[1:02:44] and she hasted and emptied her picture
[1:02:46] into the trough and ran again into the
[1:02:48] well to draw water
[1:02:49] and drew for all his camels
[1:02:53] so god had go well abraham had sent
[1:02:56] eliezer eliezer went out to fetch a
[1:02:58] bride
[1:02:58] and he prays the prayer and he said lord
[1:03:01] the damsel that comes and i ask for a
[1:03:02] drink but also will water my camels
[1:03:04] let her be the one that you've appointed
[1:03:07] so she already proved that she was the
[1:03:10] appointed one
[1:03:12] but she's still going to have to come to
[1:03:13] a time of decision
[1:03:16] let's go to paragraph 54.
[1:03:22] i mean sorry paragraph 24 verse 54.
[1:03:25] sorry genesis 24 54.
[1:03:31] this man goes he goes into their home
[1:03:33] he's been invited in and it says in
[1:03:35] in verse 54 and they did eat and drink
[1:03:38] he and the men that were with them and
[1:03:39] they tarried all night and they rose up
[1:03:41] in the morning and he said send me away
[1:03:43] to my master
[1:03:44] and her brother and her mother said let
[1:03:46] the damsel abide with us a few days
[1:03:48] at least ten after that she shall go
[1:03:51] and he said unto them hinder me not
[1:03:53] seeing that the lord has prospered my
[1:03:55] way
[1:03:55] send me away that i may go to my master
[1:03:58] and they said we will call the damsel
[1:04:00] inquire at her mouth
[1:04:02] and they called rebecca and said unto
[1:04:03] her without go with this man and she
[1:04:05] said
[1:04:06] i will go see although she was ordained
[1:04:10] although before the foundation of the
[1:04:12] world rebecca was going to be the one
[1:04:14] it still came to rebecca to make her
[1:04:16] decision
[1:04:18] she had to make a clear-cut decision and
[1:04:20] she made a decision quickly
[1:04:22] and brother bam said in the super in a
[1:04:24] super sign he said notice eliezer found
[1:04:26] the woman
[1:04:27] he knowed that was her and notice he had
[1:04:29] to deal with two people
[1:04:30] her mother and her brother the father
[1:04:32] rest of them had nothing to say
[1:04:34] mother and brother so has the messenger
[1:04:36] the holy ghost of god in this last days
[1:04:39] picking out the bride he's had to deal
[1:04:40] with the church that's called itself the
[1:04:42] mother
[1:04:43] the catholic church and the brother the
[1:04:45] preacher
[1:04:46] that's exactly he had to deal with those
[1:04:48] two
[1:04:49] they was the one that kicked up a fuss
[1:04:51] about it brother brown is now typing
[1:04:53] this with his own ministry
[1:04:54] then he's saying now the messenger at
[1:04:56] the end time which he said was the holy
[1:04:57] ghost had to deal with
[1:04:58] two forces had to deal with the mother
[1:05:00] and had to deal with the brother that
[1:05:02] tried to hold her back
[1:05:05] but now he said you got to make your
[1:05:08] choice will you go
[1:05:09] and look quickly as soon as she heard
[1:05:11] about isaac before she had ever saw him
[1:05:13] she said i will go why
[1:05:16] she was a blood relative to him
[1:05:19] see what was abraham's that was
[1:05:21] abraham's brother's child isaac and
[1:05:22] rebecca were first cousins
[1:05:24] blood relations showing that the church
[1:05:26] in the last days
[1:05:27] will be a blood relation to christ for
[1:05:30] the very god that predestinated the
[1:05:32] christ
[1:05:32] was the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:05:34] of the earth the church itself its name
[1:05:36] was put on the book before the
[1:05:37] foundation of the world
[1:05:39] and rebecca as soon as she heard of
[1:05:40] isaac there was something in her that
[1:05:42] pulled her straight to him
[1:05:44] though she hadn't seen her or nothing
[1:05:46] she yet wanted to go
[1:05:48] by her own choice away from her mother
[1:05:51] and her brother i said praise god
[1:05:54] she made a decision quickly before she
[1:05:57] saw the end of the matter
[1:05:58] before she was she saw what she looked
[1:06:00] like because she was of the same blood
[1:06:02] relations amen she would whatever family
[1:06:05] isaac was
[1:06:05] she was and when she heard it she said
[1:06:08] that's what i want
[1:06:09] i will go she didn't have to wait
[1:06:13] and the message identification he said
[1:06:14] then if they do
[1:06:16] you were with god and his thoughts at
[1:06:18] the beginning how can you deny his word
[1:06:20] being true when you are
[1:06:21] part of his word you are blood relations
[1:06:27] you are the same family you come from
[1:06:29] the same place
[1:06:30] amen where did you come from from the
[1:06:32] mind of god you've come from the same
[1:06:34] place you're of the same family
[1:06:35] your blood relations so when you hear it
[1:06:38] there's something in you
[1:06:40] amen you can make your decision quickly
[1:06:42] you don't have to wait to see what the
[1:06:43] end of the matter is
[1:06:44] because there's a life inside of you
[1:06:46] there's something in you because your
[1:06:48] blood relations when you hear
[1:06:49] eleazar make the call although my church
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:53] preacher tried to hold you back you said
[1:06:55] i'll go
[1:07:00] he said
[1:07:04] this is all the way back in 1956 the
[1:07:06] prophet of god says
[1:07:07] faith is what you do not see it's what
[1:07:09] you believe
[1:07:11] you don't need to see it but there's
[1:07:13] something inside of you sees
[1:07:15] there's something inside of you sees it
[1:07:18] and that's
[1:07:18] god that's inside something inside of
[1:07:22] you sees the truth
[1:07:24] he said that's god that's inside sees
[1:07:27] his
[1:07:28] own word being made manifest
[1:07:32] your blood relation something in you
[1:07:34] sees the word may manifest what is that
[1:07:36] that's in you that sees it
[1:07:37] amen it's invisible to these eyes but
[1:07:39] what's in it it's
[1:07:40] god that's in you that sees it
[1:07:45] he says in all this is back in 1955 and
[1:07:48] jehovah jair
[1:07:49] said his faith didn't fail he didn't
[1:07:52] stagger reached over and got his son
[1:07:54] tied his hands in his feet his only
[1:07:56] beloved son
[1:07:57] god in abraham you see it
[1:08:01] god in abraham you see god told abraham
[1:08:05] take thy son thine only son amen and
[1:08:08] abraham was here typing the father that
[1:08:10] would sacrifice his only son and it was
[1:08:12] showing jesus christ coming
[1:08:13] but it wasn't just abraham it was god in
[1:08:16] abraham
[1:08:18] god could take his own word through
[1:08:21] abraham
[1:08:22] to trust himself
[1:08:25] it was god and abraham there was a part
[1:08:28] of god and abraham there was an
[1:08:29] attribute of god in abraham
[1:08:31] there was a germ of life of god in
[1:08:33] abraham and
[1:08:34] through abraham god could believe his
[1:08:36] own word
[1:08:39] it's not what you and i have done amen
[1:08:41] there's something
[1:08:42] in us amen we come from the same source
[1:08:44] we're going back to the same source we
[1:08:46] have the same father the same origin
[1:08:49] there's a something an attribute inside
[1:08:50] of us that when you see it
[1:08:52] god through the bride can believe the
[1:08:55] word
[1:08:57] rebecca although her family they him
[1:09:00] hold around and want to hold back but
[1:09:01] rebecca
[1:09:02] amen was the same blood relation as
[1:09:04] isaac and when she saw it she said i'll
[1:09:06] go
[1:09:12] in the message trying to do god of
[1:09:13] service he said and if the bride
[1:09:16] is to be the word then she's got to be
[1:09:18] of christ
[1:09:19] part of the bridegroom she's got to be
[1:09:21] the word the word not for this day
[1:09:24] the the not not the word for his day
[1:09:28] the word of this day you catch that
[1:09:32] she's got to be part of their bridegroom
[1:09:34] she's got to be the word
[1:09:35] the word not for his day the word of
[1:09:38] this day
[1:09:39] that he promised would be this day that
[1:09:41] he sent his word forth to mold his bride
[1:09:44] and maker
[1:09:45] hope we see it don't get some idea of
[1:09:47] your own now and don't take somebody
[1:09:49] else's idea
[1:09:50] take the vindicated word here the bible
[1:09:52] it says god has promised in his word
[1:09:55] how he would choose his bride in the
[1:09:57] last day did you know that
[1:09:58] he promised how he would do it and that
[1:10:01] by his original plan of choosing christ
[1:10:03] of choosing the times choosing the
[1:10:05] seasons
[1:10:06] he can't miss it on his bride because
[1:10:08] she is part of that word
[1:10:10] he can't choose it by denomination when
[1:10:13] he didn't choose christ by a
[1:10:14] denomination
[1:10:16] did christ come to a denomination did he
[1:10:18] come by the nomination no
[1:10:20] they rejected him well that's what the
[1:10:22] denomination done then
[1:10:23] then when he when he chooses a bride can
[1:10:26] he come any other way
[1:10:28] how did he bring christ here by the word
[1:10:30] of the prophets is that right
[1:10:32] how will he bring his bride here by the
[1:10:34] word of the prophets
[1:10:37] how did he identify him when he come by
[1:10:39] a man with the spirit of elijah upon him
[1:10:41] come out of the wilderness
[1:10:42] how will he identify his bride he
[1:10:45] promised in malachi 4 the same thing
[1:10:47] before he destroyed the earth
[1:10:48] like it was in the days of sodom
[1:10:54] she's flesh of his flesh
[1:10:57] bone of his bone
[1:11:04] brother branham was answering a question
[1:11:06] in 1964 in questions and answers
[1:11:09] but now this picture is the main thing
[1:11:13] then in the resurrection those gases and
[1:11:16] asses and things comes right back into
[1:11:17] the place and develops the picture again
[1:11:20] the picture god had of you before the
[1:11:22] foundation of the world
[1:11:23] now this picture was not taken when you
[1:11:25] were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your
[1:11:27] best
[1:11:28] when was it taken before there was a
[1:11:30] foundation in the world it was put in
[1:11:31] god's great file
[1:11:34] and then the only thing it did was
[1:11:35] featured itself here for you to make
[1:11:38] your
[1:11:38] choice we had to come down
[1:11:42] god already had a picture of us he
[1:11:43] already had a completion in his mind
[1:11:46] just like he already had a rebecca but
[1:11:47] she had to make her choice
[1:11:50] he already had a mary amen and mary was
[1:11:53] going to be the wound that was going to
[1:11:55] bring forth christ
[1:11:56] he already had her chosen more than
[1:11:58] before the foundation of the world it
[1:12:00] was already prophesied 700 years before
[1:12:02] but he was going to come to mary and
[1:12:04] mary had to make her choice
[1:12:07] because god's a gentleman he doesn't
[1:12:09] force anything he predestinates
[1:12:11] but he he wants the seed to respond back
[1:12:14] to the seed
[1:12:14] and god on the inside and god in the
[1:12:16] word and the two are coming together
[1:12:19] and there's got to be a clear-cut
[1:12:21] decision there's got to be a choice
[1:12:22] and god set it up on free moral agency
[1:12:25] so that it wouldn't be by force
[1:12:27] he doesn't want it to be by force he
[1:12:29] wants it to be by love
[1:12:32] rebecca was motivated by love and she
[1:12:34] hadn't even seen isaac yet but something
[1:12:36] inside of her could already love him and
[1:12:38] brother banham said when when she saw
[1:12:40] him afar off amen and he saw her afar
[1:12:43] off he had come out in the cool of the
[1:12:45] evening to walk in the field
[1:12:46] and she was coming on the camel train
[1:12:48] and from far off they slid down he said
[1:12:50] it was love at first sight
[1:12:51] why because they were made for one
[1:12:53] another
[1:12:55] and you were made for this revealed word
[1:12:57] in this hour and this revealed word was
[1:12:59] made for you
[1:13:02] when adam saw his wife amen the moment
[1:13:05] he saw his wife he didn't have to decide
[1:13:07] do i want or do i not he said he wanted
[1:13:08] her
[1:13:09] here flesh with my flesh and bone of my
[1:13:10] bone
[1:13:12] she had come out from him
[1:13:15] rebecca could make the choice mary
[1:13:19] she could say be it unto me according to
[1:13:21] thy word
[1:13:22] you know she had to say that
[1:13:25] is that right she had to have the right
[1:13:29] to refuse
[1:13:33] to have free moral agency she had to
[1:13:35] have the right to refuse
[1:13:38] brother branham said jesus christ could
[1:13:40] have married a wife and raised children
[1:13:44] he had to make his choice and his
[1:13:48] free choice he surrendered his will to
[1:13:50] the will of the father
[1:13:52] set an example for you and i we've got
[1:13:54] to make our choice
[1:13:56] god has already predestinated absolutely
[1:13:58] it's already in the mind of god
[1:14:00] but god's not forcing the issue god
[1:14:03] wants a love relationship amen
[1:14:04] he put something on the inside that can
[1:14:06] respond to that word because he wants
[1:14:08] us to say i will go be it unto me i will
[1:14:12] go i will do
[1:14:13] i will have i will give up i want to
[1:14:18] when rebecca went with eleazar she
[1:14:20] wasn't going i said i guess if i have to
[1:14:23] you said you already prayed
[1:14:30] rebecca wasn't saying well i mean i
[1:14:33] guess
[1:14:33] do i have any choice you told me you
[1:14:35] already
[1:14:38] rebecca wanted to go
[1:14:41] mary didn't say well you're gabriel i
[1:14:43] mean
[1:14:45] i really don't want to be pregnant i
[1:14:47] really don't i mean i really don't want
[1:14:49] to mess up my plans
[1:14:53] but when she was presented with the word
[1:14:54] for her hour there was something inside
[1:14:56] of her say be it unto me according to
[1:14:58] your word
[1:14:59] but it had to be her choice
[1:15:04] she had to choose
[1:15:09] brother branham said and the message
[1:15:12] ministry explained
[1:15:17] he said you're not destroyed or
[1:15:18] separated from god because you're a
[1:15:20] sinner
[1:15:20] you're separated from god because you
[1:15:22] refused to walk with him
[1:15:25] to walk in his provided way
[1:15:28] you've got death and life before you
[1:15:29] just like adam and eve every man's free
[1:15:31] moral agent
[1:15:32] and the tree of life and the tree of
[1:15:34] death is before us all you can take
[1:15:36] either one you wish to it depends on
[1:15:38] what tree you eat off
[1:15:39] of is what you are that's right
[1:15:42] god created you a free moral agent to do
[1:15:45] whatever you want to do about it
[1:15:48] he can't make you love him he don't
[1:15:51] force you to
[1:15:52] love him if i forced my wife to love me
[1:15:55] i'd be afraid to marry her
[1:16:00] think about that statement if i forced
[1:16:03] my wife to love me i'd be afraid to
[1:16:05] marry
[1:16:06] her why because if she was forced to
[1:16:08] love you she wouldn't be faithful
[1:16:11] but you want a wife that loves you a
[1:16:12] free choice
[1:16:14] because she loves you because she wants
[1:16:16] to if i forced my wife to love me
[1:16:19] i'd be afraid to marry her but she come
[1:16:23] accepting me for what i was and married
[1:16:25] me that's right and she loved me and she
[1:16:27] accepted me that way
[1:16:29] and that's the way we got to come to god
[1:16:31] he wants us to love him
[1:16:32] and come and believe his word
[1:16:38] god is not looking for a wife
[1:16:41] that he forced into marriage
[1:16:45] he's not looking for a relationship
[1:16:47] where you have no choice
[1:16:50] because you can't trust that kind of
[1:16:52] relationship
[1:16:54] but god has in this day that we live he
[1:16:57] set it out here
[1:16:58] just like the the house of the women
[1:17:01] that hagee i was in charge of
[1:17:02] we've got any choice that you want
[1:17:06] you we can go to any church we want we
[1:17:08] can believe whatever we want
[1:17:11] yeah is that right you can next sunday
[1:17:14] this sudden you can go to any choice of
[1:17:16] church that you want to go to
[1:17:17] and you can believe anything you want to
[1:17:19] do and guess what a lightning bolt is
[1:17:21] not going to strike you dead the moment
[1:17:22] you do it
[1:17:24] because god's giving you a choice
[1:17:28] why because he's looking for that
[1:17:31] attribute
[1:17:32] that would choose him back
[1:17:35] he's all right there's a magnetism that
[1:17:37] has to take place there's an attraction
[1:17:39] that has to be there amen and it's
[1:17:41] expressed in free moral agency
[1:17:43] when you can choose what you want you
[1:17:45] can have what you want you can go where
[1:17:47] you want
[1:17:50] but when all you want is him and all you
[1:17:51] want is the word then he's found
[1:17:53] a wife that'll take him for who he is
[1:17:57] not for who she wants him to be
[1:18:00] that's why god has brought the word in
[1:18:02] this day and he is he has corrected all
[1:18:04] the fallacy of man and all the
[1:18:05] denominationalism
[1:18:07] because they've made their own husband
[1:18:08] what they want their husband to be
[1:18:11] they've made the doctrine and they've
[1:18:13] twisted the word and they've changed god
[1:18:15] and they changed christ in the image
[1:18:16] they want him to be i want him to be
[1:18:19] like this so i'll preach that he's like
[1:18:20] this
[1:18:22] i want him to have this kind of mercy
[1:18:24] and i want him to have this kind of
[1:18:25] grace and i don't want him to have this
[1:18:26] kind of judgment and i don't want him to
[1:18:28] feel this way about
[1:18:29] you know whatever and so they preach a
[1:18:32] man a husband of their own making
[1:18:34] they make a plastic husband and that's
[1:18:37] what they marry
[1:18:38] amen but god has set it up this way you
[1:18:40] can have whatever you want
[1:18:41] you can make your own plastic husband
[1:18:42] you can come up with your own doctrine
[1:18:44] you can start your own church
[1:18:47] you can start your own message church
[1:18:49] and you can doctor up the message and
[1:18:50] make it any way you want it to be
[1:18:54] because he's looking for a bride after
[1:18:56] his own heart one that he can trust
[1:18:57] completely amen
[1:18:59] completely trust so he will bring a
[1:19:01] prophet in our day to present
[1:19:02] exactly what he is
[1:19:06] this is what i am this is who i am and
[1:19:09] haggai
[1:19:10] will tell us all about the king and all
[1:19:13] about his pleasure
[1:19:14] and all about what he wants
[1:19:18] and the majority of the women were still
[1:19:19] worried about which pearls they were
[1:19:20] going to wear
[1:19:24] and whether the blue shoes are the red
[1:19:25] shoes
[1:19:28] but there was one in the crowd that was
[1:19:32] listening to haggai
[1:19:35] because she knew that in order
[1:19:38] to be that chosen one i'm going to have
[1:19:40] to please
[1:19:41] that king
[1:19:46] in the day when we can have whatever we
[1:19:48] want god doesn't take away from moral
[1:19:50] agency it's still in effect friends
[1:19:53] in fact our choice is many of us are
[1:19:55] still suffering from our choices
[1:19:58] and we say god i wish god would have
[1:20:00] stopped me from making my choices god
[1:20:02] set up free mortal agency and he's
[1:20:03] letting it ride
[1:20:05] and many of us are suffering from our
[1:20:07] choices
[1:20:09] because he's going to take the same
[1:20:11] thing
[1:20:12] free choice and he's going to prove a
[1:20:16] bride by free choice
[1:20:20] he proved esther because she could take
[1:20:23] whatever she desired
[1:20:25] into her meeting with the king and when
[1:20:28] she wanted
[1:20:29] nothing what haggai said
[1:20:32] that proves she was the one and in this
[1:20:35] day
[1:20:36] god has laid out the back part of god's
[1:20:38] mind what god wants what god expects
[1:20:40] what god likes
[1:20:41] how he wants his church to act how he
[1:20:43] wants his church to look
[1:20:44] what he wants his church to believe
[1:20:49] and he's not going to force his bride
[1:20:51] into it he laid it out here because he
[1:20:53] wants one he can trust
[1:20:56] he's looking for the one that'll please
[1:20:59] him
[1:21:02] and i say god
[1:21:05] i want to take my free choice
[1:21:09] and i want to surrender my will
[1:21:12] god has given us free will so that we
[1:21:14] can voluntarily
[1:21:16] surrender our will and prove our love to
[1:21:20] him and show our respects
[1:21:22] and our faith in god let's all stand
[1:21:26] musicians have you come
[1:21:31] this
[1:21:34] path of free choice has not gone away
[1:21:36] yet
[1:21:38] and god is still proving that he's going
[1:21:40] to have the right kind of bride
[1:21:43] and he's doing it by the choices he lets
[1:21:45] us make every day
[1:21:47] and i say when it comes time to make our
[1:21:51] next choices
[1:21:53] i know for me i just want to stop and
[1:21:55] say
[1:21:56] what did haggy i say
[1:22:00] i'm faced with a choice here i got to
[1:22:02] choose one way or the other
[1:22:04] and and you know what i'm tired of my
[1:22:06] own choices
[1:22:07] are you guys tired of your own choices
[1:22:10] i'm tired of my own choices
[1:22:11] i don't want my own choices i want to do
[1:22:13] what's pleasing to the king
[1:22:15] how do i know it's pleasing to the king
[1:22:17] he gave us a message in this day
[1:22:18] he restored the word he opened the bible
[1:22:21] to us so we know what he wants we know
[1:22:23] who he is we know what he's like
[1:22:24] we see his character we see his nature
[1:22:26] we see his demeanor and all he's wanting
[1:22:28] is a bride that will reflect that
[1:22:31] and i say god that's all i want that's
[1:22:34] all i want
[1:22:35] and that's all i want to be i don't
[1:22:37] anymore want the things that laodicea
[1:22:39] offers i'm tired of it
[1:22:42] i'm sick of satisfying the flesh i'm
[1:22:45] absolutely tired
[1:22:46] of fulfilling once what i want more than
[1:22:49] anything is to please him
[1:22:52] i say god help me
[1:22:55] let's all pray lord jesus we thank you
[1:22:59] god
[1:23:01] that in this hour that we live you're
[1:23:03] calling us out of religion
[1:23:05] into a relationship out of formality
[1:23:10] out of false doctrine false teaching
[1:23:12] false understanding
[1:23:13] out of self-will and self-love

[1:23:21] and god that's what we want to be
[1:23:24] help us god as we surrender
[1:23:28] you have given us free moral agency and
[1:23:31] there's a power that lays in that lord
[1:23:34] it was powerful enough that when your
[1:23:36] children chose wrong
[1:23:38] it would take your beautiful creation
[1:23:40] and bring a perversion
[1:23:42] and set corruption and that would bring
[1:23:44] destruction
[1:23:46] if it's that powerful lord can the same
[1:23:50] thing be used for good
[1:23:53] oh god may we make our choices lord the
[1:23:55] line up to your word
[1:23:57] may we surrender all self-will and all
[1:24:00] self-love and lay it down at your feet
[1:24:02] may we just take your choice
[1:24:05] may we just take what you've given us in
[1:24:06] this hour and be clothed with it lord
[1:24:09] be perfumed by it and be pleasing to you
[1:24:13] take away all of our selfishness lord
[1:24:15] and all of our pride

[1:24:20] ourselves down and choose your word
[1:24:23] and choose your way for god i want that
[1:24:26] to be my choice

[1:24:35] with us as we go from here let us be a
[1:24:37] bright and shining light lord that we

[1:24:41] your praises may others see the light
[1:24:44] that shines from us
[1:24:45] and be gathered to you lord may we point
[1:24:47] them to the source
[1:24:50] may they become connected to you again
[1:24:52] be with us and guide us lord
[1:24:55] forgive us lord for the things that
[1:24:57] we've chosen the past forgive us lord
[1:24:59] for our selfishness
[1:25:01] but i pray god that you would just
[1:25:02] continue to mold us into your very image

[1:26:36] [Applause]
[1:26:43] be pleased
[1:26:53] do you remember the time brother branham
[1:26:55] was preaching
[1:26:57] and danny henry came up to him at the
[1:26:58] end of service and wrapped his arms
[1:27:00] around him and gave
[1:27:01] a prophecy over him in french and it was
[1:27:03] translated
[1:27:05] in that prophecy it says because you've
[1:27:07] chosen the harder way
[1:27:09] the narrow path and you've done this of
[1:27:12] your
[1:27:13] own choosing listen god had already
[1:27:16] foreordained it he sought before the
[1:27:18] foundation of the world
[1:27:19] do you think that prophet do you think
[1:27:21] he was going to go any other way
[1:27:24] god had already ordained it so god
[1:27:25] already saw it but god was still so
[1:27:28] pleased when he saw a man who could
[1:27:30] choose any way you want
[1:27:31] he would choose the harder way he would
[1:27:34] choose
[1:27:34] by his own choosing no force no coercion
[1:27:38] god not pushing him into it but he
[1:27:40] himself would say
[1:27:41] i'll take the narrow away i'll take the
[1:27:44] harder way
[1:27:46] it's so pleased god amen that when that
[1:27:49] man wrapped his arms around him
[1:27:50] he began to speak in perfect french and
[1:27:53] god had a u.n interpreter there and he
[1:27:54] had a woman who spoke french there and
[1:27:57] another interpreter there amen and they
[1:27:59] all gave the interpretation and it all
[1:28:01] matched
[1:28:01] god was so pleased with a man amen
[1:28:04] what was he doing he was walking in the
[1:28:06] vision god had already ordained it he
[1:28:08] was doing what god told him to do
[1:28:10] but god wasn't going to shove him in a
[1:28:12] tube and pull him out the other end
[1:28:13] and said you chose no he had his own
[1:28:16] choice to make
[1:28:19] as a man as an individual representative
[1:28:22] of a human being with the seed of god on
[1:28:24] the inside he had
[1:28:25] joyce and when he chose what was in
[1:28:28] god's mind
[1:28:29] god was delighted with his choice
[1:28:32] are we the bride of jesus christ i
[1:28:34] believe with all my heart i am
[1:28:36] has he saw me cross the finish line
[1:28:38] absolutely am i going to be perfected by
[1:28:40] the washing of the water this word
[1:28:42] i know it but he's still
[1:28:45] watching for my choice and i want to
[1:28:47] please him with my choice
[1:28:49] i want to make the joy i want to go the
[1:28:51] narrow way
[1:28:53] i want to take the harder choice i want
[1:28:55] to sacrifice
[1:28:56] myself i want to surrender all i want to
[1:28:58] make the choice that will cause him to
[1:29:00] say
[1:29:00] you've chosen of your own choice the
[1:29:03] precise and correct way
[1:29:05] and it is my way
[1:29:08] oh there's nothing that would make me
[1:29:10] happier than to hear him say that about
[1:29:12] me
[1:29:12] you chose you chose of your own choosing
[1:29:14] i didn't make you
[1:29:15] i didn't force you but you wanted to
[1:29:19] i say god i know
[1:29:22] there's going to be a bride in this end
[1:29:24] time that's going to choose his way

[1:29:30] prophesied
[1:29:32] it's already been spoken it's already in
[1:29:34] god's mind
[1:29:35] it's already set and it's sealed there
[1:29:37] will be a bride who won't fall away if
[1:29:40] the way eve fell
[1:29:41] she won't fall by her own carnal lust
[1:29:43] and her own will
[1:29:47] but she's going to do so of her own
[1:29:48] choosing
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:51] because she wants to
[1:29:54] not because anybody made her
[1:29:59] that's my heart's cry say god i want to
[1:30:03] show my respects and love to you
[1:30:06] by choosing you over me
[1:30:10] over my own way in every choice
[1:30:14] let that be our heart friends and every
[1:30:17] choice we make let's choose him
[1:30:19] let's choose the harder way of our own
