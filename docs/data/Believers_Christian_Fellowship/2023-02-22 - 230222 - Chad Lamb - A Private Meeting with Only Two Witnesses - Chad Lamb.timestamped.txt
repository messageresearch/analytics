[13:28] it to find good soil in US prepared
[13:30] ground Lord and may it bring forth a
[13:32] Bountiful Harvest For Your Glory
[13:35] oh we love you and we ask these things
[13:37] in Jesus Christ's name amen may God
[13:41] bless you while we're standing let's
[13:42] turn to Isaiah chapter 7 Isaiah chapter
[13:46] 7.
[13:54] we'll read just one verse in Isaiah and
[13:57] then let you have your seats
[13:59] Isaiah chapter 7 and I'd like to read
[14:02] verse 14.
[14:05] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[14:07] you a sign
[14:08] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[14:11] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[14:15] may God bless you as you take your seats
[14:19] amen I just want to say it's been nice
[14:22] to have some of the visiting ministers
[14:24] come through I mean I feel like it's
[14:26] been a long time since I preached him
[14:27] and so it's good to be here I got to get
[14:30] back into the rhythm again but I really
[14:32] enjoyed having brother Daniel come and
[14:34] then brother minnow was a last minute
[14:36] surprise I called him Tuesday and it
[14:38] just worked out and then brother yatsuk
[14:40] we had scheduled for a while so I would
[14:42] never normally schedule that many
[14:43] ministers in together but it just worked
[14:45] and it worked well and I thank God for
[14:47] each one of the brothers and for the
[14:49] nice time we had also really appreciated
[14:51] the men's fellowship breakfast that was
[14:53] a real blessing so we're thankful for
[14:55] all that worked at that all the sisters
[14:56] who pitched in and the brothers who
[14:58] helped it was really nice amen this this
[15:01] last two weeks it's been nice for me to
[15:04] have these brothers ministering it gave
[15:05] me just a little reprieve a little
[15:07] chance to kind of absorb the loss of
[15:09] brother Gideon because that really hit
[15:12] me a little bit hard and so I was
[15:14] thankful for that and God just knows
[15:16] it's good timing and I'm thankful for it
[15:19] but now we're we gotta get back in
[15:22] Action amen now it's time to take the
[15:25] word and move forward so let's turn
[15:27] together to Luke chapter one
[15:30] we're going to pick up this story again
[15:31] in Luke chapter one and and when we
[15:34] looked at uh Isaiah chapter 7 it said
[15:38] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[15:40] and so this is a promise of something
[15:43] that nobody was going to produce on
[15:46] their own
[15:46] nobody was going to Manifest this or
[15:49] produced us on their own but the Lord
[15:51] himself was going to do this because it
[15:53] was something no human being could do
[15:55] it was something nobody could do on
[15:57] their own but the Lord himself was going
[16:00] to give this sign that a virgin shall
[16:02] conceive and so we we want to look at
[16:04] Luke chapter one together
[16:06] and begin at verse 26 Luke chapter 1
[16:08] verse 26.
[16:11] and then the sixth month the angel
[16:13] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[16:15] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin a
[16:17] spouse to a man whose name was Joseph of
[16:19] the House of David and the virgin's name
[16:22] was Mary and the angel came in unto her
[16:24] and said hail thou hell thou are highly
[16:28] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[16:30] art thou among women and when she saw
[16:33] him she was troubled at a saying and
[16:35] cast in her mind what manner of
[16:37] salutation this should be and the angel
[16:39] said unto her fear not Mary for thou
[16:42] Hast found favor with God
[16:44] so we we all know this is very familiar
[16:46] to us but here is going to be the
[16:48] Fulfillment of what was promised in
[16:50] Isaiah chapter 7 the Lord himself shall
[16:52] give you a sign and when the Lord
[16:54] himself came to give a sign he sent an
[16:56] angel
[16:58] amen and then that angel carried the
[17:01] message amen and it was the it was the
[17:03] doings of the Lord it was the Lord
[17:04] himself giving a sign and the angel came
[17:08] to Mary and Mary had to receive the
[17:11] words of the Angel and what the angel
[17:13] was giving her was the confirmation of
[17:16] the prophecy
[17:17] that it had been laid down hundreds of
[17:19] years before but it was coming time now
[17:22] for what was prophecy to come into
[17:24] manifestation and the visitation of the
[17:26] Angel was going to tell her not only is
[17:28] it time but this is the place and the
[17:31] places in you
[17:33] so this is what's been prophesied that
[17:35] the Lord himself shall do he's going to
[17:37] do inside you you're the chosen one
[17:40] you're the one who's highly favored of
[17:42] the Lord and now is the time and Mary
[17:45] had to receive the words of this Angel
[17:47] as being the Fulfillment of that
[17:49] scripture amen and it's amazing it's
[17:51] something that she could not produce
[17:53] herself she could not do herself
[17:55] although she has a part to play so let's
[17:58] look down to verse 38.
[18:01] and Mary said behold the hand man of the
[18:03] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[18:06] and the angel departed from her
[18:09] amen see the Holy Ghost is brother REM
[18:11] teaches us as a gentleman amen he will
[18:13] not force himself so Mary's part was to
[18:16] surrender amen Mary's part was to
[18:18] believe what the angel said and to
[18:21] receive it amen and to open herself and
[18:23] allow that that message would pertain to
[18:26] her amen she she no matter how many
[18:29] doubts she could have about her
[18:30] worthiness
[18:32] because I'm sure amen a humble young
[18:35] virgin Amen in a town is a Nazareth I'm
[18:38] sure she didn't feel herself worthy Amen
[18:41] to to be the Fulfillment of the
[18:43] scripture she probably didn't feel
[18:44] herself amen that she she in any ways
[18:48] would be worthy or good enough for or
[18:50] any of those things can you only imagine
[18:52] what she would think
[18:55] but she had to have the ability
[18:59] to say I receive what you're saying
[19:01] about me
[19:04] and she says be it unto me according to
[19:08] Thy Word
[19:09] so she had to have a seat of faith on
[19:12] the inside to be able to receive the
[19:14] word amen an unlikely word fulfilled in
[19:17] an unlikely way to recognize that she is
[19:20] part of the Fulfillment of this word
[19:21] that God himself will do it she can't do
[19:24] it but she's got a part to play in her
[19:26] part to play is say I surrender
[19:29] I agree I give myself to you and so now
[19:33] I'd like to just for a title this
[19:36] evening I'd like to take the title of a
[19:38] private meeting with only two witnesses
[19:41] private meeting with only two witnesses
[19:44] and if you'll remember back the last few
[19:47] weeks when we were preaching we were
[19:49] we've been going down this theme of of
[19:51] the Twins and the births and the we
[19:54] talked about Ruth and Boaz we talked
[19:56] about Mary we've talked about
[19:58] um Tamar and so these things were laying
[20:01] in my heart back then and I never got to
[20:03] preach him and and I I couldn't shake
[20:05] them so they just kept I've kept
[20:06] dwelling on it and dwelling on it so I
[20:08] just want to share the the last bit of
[20:10] those thoughts that I had from before
[20:12] but you see Mary
[20:16] had to receive the word of the prophecy
[20:21] and it's very much the same way for us
[20:23] no matter who we are or how unworthy we
[20:25] are or what kind of Life we've lived or
[20:27] or whether we have skills abilities or
[20:29] don't have skills or ability none of it
[20:31] matters anymore amen because it's
[20:33] something that the Lord himself will do
[20:35] but he must have a willing vessel
[20:37] somebody who will have faith to accept
[20:38] the message and say be it unto me
[20:40] according to your word
[20:44] and so we know that there was nobody
[20:46] around when the angel Gabriel visited
[20:48] her and gave her this commission there
[20:50] was nobody present nobody else heard it
[20:52] she was the only one who heard it and
[20:54] she received it and so now she has had a
[20:57] private meeting with only two witnesses
[20:59] her and Gabriel
[21:01] and and her story is unbelievable
[21:05] it's it's not likely it's not easily
[21:09] received and we know that that that she
[21:12] was rejected amen for her confession
[21:15] when when it became obvious that she was
[21:18] pregnant
[21:19] and it began to show and it began to be
[21:21] declared and even when word came forth
[21:23] to Joseph her espoused husband he was
[21:26] mindful to put her away privately amen
[21:28] because he didn't even he didn't even
[21:31] realize what was happening he assumed
[21:32] what everybody else assumed that she had
[21:34] been unfaithful that this is this is
[21:36] adultery amen and so the Assumption in
[21:39] that day was it was adultery even
[21:41] Joseph's assumption was that it was
[21:43] adultery but he had to receive a message
[21:45] from an angel amen that would tell him
[21:47] fear not to take Mary thy wife unto thee
[21:50] for that which is conceived of hers of
[21:52] the Holy Ghost he had to himself realize
[21:54] that this is of god this is something
[21:56] the Lord himself is doing
[21:58] not even something Mary did this is
[22:00] something the Lord has done
[22:03] so the assumption that day by everybody
[22:06] that this was adultery amen and and Mary
[22:09] held the secret within her heart she
[22:12] knew this was the Fulfillment of Isaiah
[22:14] 7.
[22:15] she knew it because she received the and
[22:18] believed what the angel had told her as
[22:20] a messenger from God she believed it she
[22:23] received it by faith when she received
[22:25] it by faith amen the Holy Ghost came
[22:27] into her and what was conceived within
[22:30] her amen was the son of God and it began
[22:33] to change her life it began to
[22:35] physically change her
[22:37] and and she would go forth and we know
[22:40] testified to Elizabeth before one change
[22:42] took place she had so much faith in what
[22:44] she had heard she went forth and began
[22:46] to testify of what happened and then her
[22:48] testimony was backed up by the change in
[22:50] her life amen but nobody else except
[22:53] Elizabeth and Zacharias and and Joseph
[22:56] and I don't know who else in that day
[22:57] would believe her testimony
[23:00] because she had a private meeting and
[23:01] there were only two witnesses and you
[23:03] couldn't lead somebody else to Gabriel
[23:05] to find out
[23:06] you couldn't put him on the stand
[23:10] and so brother Brahm says this and um in
[23:13] the message birth pains
[23:15] it says but after eight days the mother
[23:17] brought the little baby in wrapped in
[23:19] swaddling cloth it swaddling cloth they
[23:23] didn't have nothing to put on it was a
[23:25] little rag off a yoke of an ox and I'm
[23:27] told that there was swaddling cloth here
[23:29] come
[23:29] here come Joseph and them coming in with
[23:31] this little baby I'd imagine the mother
[23:33] stuck back from a distance with her
[23:36] little babies with needlework and
[23:38] everything looky here see there she is
[23:40] she was pregnant by that man here she
[23:43] comes in that stay away from her keep
[23:45] your distance they still think the same
[23:48] thing
[23:49] do they still think the same thing
[23:52] but Mary with that baby in her arms it
[23:55] didn't make any difference what they
[23:57] thought she knowed whose son that was
[24:01] amen she knowed she herself knew beyond
[24:06] a shot of a doubt where this baby came
[24:08] from amen she knew it didn't come from
[24:10] Joseph she didn't she knew it didn't
[24:12] come from a soldier she knew all of it
[24:14] was lies amen but but what she held in
[24:17] her hand was the manifestation of the
[24:19] promise and it wasn't her it was
[24:21] something the Lord himself had done
[24:24] not something she did something the Lord
[24:26] himself had done
[24:28] and she was holding it in her arms and
[24:31] and I would say this way she had to turn
[24:34] a deaf ear to everything else she heard
[24:37] amen because she can no more prove
[24:39] anything she had no certificate she had
[24:42] no Witnesses she had no way back then
[24:44] there was no DNA test there was no
[24:49] she had no evidence she had no proof she
[24:52] was holding a baby but they would deny
[24:54] the source of the baby
[24:56] so so she had to go by faith and she had
[25:00] to know in herself where this child came
[25:04] from
[25:06] it didn't do her any good to argue
[25:09] it didn't do her any good to fuss it
[25:11] didn't do her any good to try to get
[25:12] together a committee that would believe
[25:13] her and go around and convince the the
[25:15] priest and the Pharisees and the elders
[25:17] and none of that would ever work none of
[25:19] it ever has worked none of it will work
[25:21] today amen she had to stand alone on the
[25:24] knowledge of where this child came from
[25:29] and so brother he says again it didn't
[25:32] make any difference what they thought
[25:33] she'd knowed whose son that was and so
[25:36] is every believer that accepts God's
[25:38] word into their heart I don't care what
[25:40] the systems say you know what it is it's
[25:42] a promise of God it was revealed to you
[25:44] by the Holy Ghost when you were
[25:46] overshadowed with his power you know you
[25:49] know where it's at no man has a right to
[25:51] preach the gospel until he's met God on
[25:53] the back side of the desert in that
[25:55] burning bush to where there's no
[25:56] ecclesiastical system in the world can
[25:59] explain it away from you you were there
[26:01] it happened to you I don't care what the
[26:04] system says you're a witness of it
[26:07] this is where Mary was Mary amen she was
[26:10] she was walking amen through the temple
[26:12] amen going at the Eighth Day for the
[26:15] circumcision and for the offering that
[26:17] must be made then she's carrying the
[26:18] baby in her arms she's holding the very
[26:21] manifestation of Isaiah 7. amen the
[26:24] Fulfillment in her arm what was told to
[26:26] her by Gabriel she's holding it it's her
[26:29] evidence she knows it amen it's her
[26:31] token but it's only a token to her it's
[26:33] a token to nobody else because nobody
[26:35] else believes it
[26:40] nothing she could have said would have
[26:41] convinced them otherwise
[26:43] and she has to walk in and hearing The
[26:45] Whispers
[26:47] maybe she catches little phrases little
[26:50] bits of conversation and she knows
[26:53] enough to know what they're talking
[26:54] about
[26:55] she heard it in Nazareth she heard it in
[26:57] Bethlehem
[27:00] she knows what they're saying about her
[27:04] she doesn't run to them and confront
[27:06] them
[27:07] she just keeps moving forward in the
[27:11] prophecy
[27:14] because she knows whose baby this is
[27:19] the life that she had received
[27:22] was the son of God
[27:25] that life within her began to change her
[27:29] began to she had physical changes in her
[27:33] body no doubt emotional changes as well
[27:35] she began to change and and she knew
[27:39] what was the result of what was the
[27:40] cause of the change
[27:42] she knew when she started feeling funny
[27:45] feelings she knew where it came from she
[27:47] knew when she began to grow and when she
[27:50] began to have different Cravings or
[27:52] hunger her appetite increased or what
[27:54] whatever was happening to her she knew
[27:56] why
[27:57] others around her could question why but
[27:59] she knew why amen and then this life
[28:02] that she had received began to change
[28:04] her amen and I would say uh if I could
[28:07] say it this way to receive the words of
[28:10] Gabriel was voluntary
[28:13] it was voluntary God never forces
[28:16] himself on anybody now God never pushes
[28:18] himself on somebody against their will
[28:20] amen she herself had to make her choice
[28:23] she had the right of free moral agency
[28:25] to accept or to reject what Gabriel was
[28:27] saying and she herself received it that
[28:30] was her choice Amen to say be it unto me
[28:33] according to their word to receive the
[28:35] prophecy but after she received that
[28:37] life the changes that would come to her
[28:39] were no longer her choice
[28:42] it wasn't her doing it it was the life
[28:44] she received now doing it in her
[28:47] amen it was now that life form was
[28:50] changing her physically changing her
[28:52] appetite changing so many things in her
[28:55] life because she yielded to what was
[28:57] told or she received it as from the Lord
[29:00] for her personally and when she took it
[29:02] to herself amen now the Holy Ghost came
[29:05] amen and there was a seed that was in
[29:08] her in her life now and it was the seed
[29:10] of God now coming to life and now
[29:12] growing and it was changing her
[29:14] involuntarily
[29:19] and the life in her
[29:21] begin to change the circumstances around
[29:24] her
[29:25] people begin to murmur people begin to
[29:29] pull away there was accusations then
[29:31] Joseph received a revelation and he
[29:34] would stand by her and Elizabeth would
[29:36] catch it by the Holy Ghost when as soon
[29:38] as the greeting came from Mary the Holy
[29:40] Ghost would strike her the babe that was
[29:42] dead in her would leap to life she would
[29:44] begin to prophesy amen things around her
[29:47] were changing because of what she
[29:49] received
[29:50] Mary wasn't changing them the life
[29:52] inside of Mary was moving everything
[29:54] around her amen there was people taking
[29:57] sides amen some believing amen some
[29:59] disbelieving some not knowing what was
[30:01] going on
[30:04] and then there was a certain position
[30:06] Mary had to come into
[30:09] because there was also more prophecy to
[30:11] be fulfilled and there was prophecy that
[30:13] Bethlehem that a scepter would rise out
[30:16] of Judah and out of Bethlehem would come
[30:18] a governor
[30:20] and so Mary can no more put herself in
[30:23] Bethlehem then she could fly to the moon
[30:25] amen but the life inside of her started
[30:27] changing the governments around her
[30:32] and in line with the word why because
[30:36] she received what the angel said about
[30:38] her
[30:39] and it began to move everything
[30:41] according to that prophecy there were
[30:43] other prophecies linked to that prophecy
[30:46] which linked to other prophecies amen
[30:48] and the word in her was bringing the
[30:50] word around her the world around her to
[30:53] manifest that word
[30:55] and now uh Caesar would get an idea
[31:01] out of the blue
[31:04] to bring a taxation upon all the world
[31:06] where everybody had to go back to the
[31:08] home of their father and because Joseph
[31:10] was of the lineage of David he had to go
[31:13] to the city of David which was when
[31:15] David's birthplace which was Bethlehem
[31:17] so now he's got to go back to his
[31:18] homeland for a senses and for taxation
[31:22] what was moving this life inside of Mary
[31:25] was moving at all now Mary amen and
[31:28] Joseph when she's heavy to be delivered
[31:30] An Inconvenient time to be traveling now
[31:33] she has to make a long journey from
[31:35] Nazareth down to Bethlehem it was
[31:36] probably difficult for her she would
[31:38] have probably never chose to do that on
[31:40] her own but the life inside of her was
[31:43] changing the circumstances around her to
[31:45] put her in position to fulfill the rest
[31:48] of the prophecy
[31:50] how involuntarily
[31:56] oh my goodness we think we have so much
[31:59] control we we really you realize this is
[32:03] something God himself is going to do in
[32:05] our lives God himself has to do it in
[32:07] our lives we can't do it ourselves but
[32:09] we have the power to accept or reject
[32:12] the prophecy concerning you and I and if
[32:14] we accept it and receive it and the Holy
[32:16] Ghost will come and come to life within
[32:18] us the life within us will start to
[32:20] arrange everything outside of us
[32:22] involuntarily people will reject people
[32:25] will believe people will scratch their
[32:27] head and not know what to do all of a
[32:29] sudden plants will close businesses will
[32:31] shut down people will reject things will
[32:34] go good things will go bad everything
[32:36] around us will start to change things we
[32:38] would have never decided to do ourselves
[32:40] positions we would have never taken
[32:42] moves we would have never made amen but
[32:44] all of a sudden the life inside of US
[32:46] starts changing circumstances around us
[32:48] to put us in position for the
[32:50] furtherance of the Gospel
[32:52] so that the prophecy concerning our
[32:55] lives will come to manifestation why
[32:58] because we received what the messenger
[33:00] said about
[33:05] Mary
[33:07] may not have even fully comprehended
[33:09] what was happening to her
[33:11] she may have not put two and two
[33:13] together
[33:15] that now we have to go to Bethlehem she
[33:16] may not have even been thinking about
[33:18] the prophecy
[33:21] you see it's Christ in US
[33:25] that is making a way for himself
[33:29] it's this word that we have received the
[33:32] life of the word has come to live its
[33:34] own life and it's moving things around
[33:36] us sometimes involuntarily because we
[33:39] wouldn't break those relationships
[33:42] we wouldn't we wouldn't uh we wouldn't
[33:45] cause a census in a taxation in our
[33:48] lives
[33:50] but God doesn't
[33:52] God does it so that what's in him will
[33:55] come to manifestation so so his desire
[33:58] that now he's placed in Mary has to be
[34:01] in the right place at the right time for
[34:03] the word
[34:04] and now she must make that difficult
[34:07] Journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem why
[34:10] because he had already purposed in his
[34:12] word that out of Bethlehem the governor
[34:14] shall come
[34:16] and so
[34:18] the same is true for us
[34:21] the word is going to be fulfilled
[34:23] there's prophecies attached to this
[34:25] bride amen and when we receive Christ
[34:28] when we receive the word for our day
[34:30] amen as the angel messenger is coming
[34:33] our day to the seventh angel to come and
[34:35] tell us what our identity is where we
[34:38] are in the scriptures what prophecies to
[34:40] be fulfilled in us when we receive that
[34:42] when we receive it and receive the Holy
[34:44] Ghost it begins to change things inside
[34:46] of us it begins to change our life but
[34:49] it also begins to change the world
[34:51] that's around us
[34:55] we think the world's going into chaos
[34:57] just because the world's going into
[34:59] chaos the world's going into chaos
[35:01] because of the word inside of you that's
[35:03] coming to fullness
[35:06] because there's prophecies that must be
[35:08] fulfilled in this bride there's things
[35:10] there's manifestations there's there's
[35:12] things that must take place that's been
[35:14] prophesied that the prophets told us
[35:15] that's laying in the scriptures amen and
[35:18] the world is going into chaos and
[35:19] governments are shaking and everything's
[35:21] going wild and why is it going wild
[35:24] because there's something in you growing
[35:26] to maturity and there's another
[35:27] manifestation amen because you said be
[35:30] it unto me according to your word
[35:31] because somebody received this word the
[35:34] word's been growing in a bride amen it's
[35:37] bringing the world into a certain
[35:38] condition to position the bride in a
[35:40] certain place for a manifestation
[35:47] we may not even understand what's
[35:48] happening and why
[35:50] we may not even be listen we may not
[35:53] even be able to put two and two together
[35:58] we may not figure out why this is
[36:00] happening and why that's happening why
[36:02] they've changed this law and why this
[36:04] Rule and why this cycle and why why why
[36:07] and why is it coming the the pressure's
[36:10] coming and why are we having to change
[36:12] things and why is all this happening you
[36:14] may not even know why it's happening but
[36:16] rest assured God has a plan in his mind
[36:18] his word will be fulfilled and the life
[36:21] inside of you is moving the world around
[36:23] you to make a way for his own display
[36:26] man
[36:29] because the Lord himself
[36:31] shall give you a sign
[36:35] Abraham goes on to say about Mary said
[36:37] but Mary
[36:40] but Mary as she held that little baby in
[36:43] her arm
[36:44] no matter what any of them said she
[36:46] knowed whose son that was
[36:49] do you know what life it is that's in
[36:51] you
[36:52] do you know it's beyond your own idea
[36:55] are you sure that it's beyond your own
[36:57] idea beyond your own life that is
[36:59] something beyond your own thoughts
[37:00] there's something more inside of me than
[37:03] what there's something more inside of me
[37:05] than the genetics I got from my parents
[37:06] there's something more inside of me than
[37:08] this flesh body I got or this Earthly
[37:10] spirit that I received at my first
[37:12] breath there's something else in me
[37:14] that's come alive and it's not just me
[37:17] it's him and me
[37:20] she knew son this was she could take the
[37:24] ridicule she could take the scorn she
[37:26] could turn a deaf ear to what was being
[37:27] said and keep moving through the
[37:29] scriptures because she knew whose son
[37:30] that was
[37:33] brother sister is not a man or a woman
[37:34] in here that's ever had the Holy Spirit
[37:36] come upon them in a new birth but what
[37:39] knows what that's in your heart
[37:41] let them call anything they want to but
[37:43] you know what you're cradling
[37:50] as Mary moved down to Bethlehem
[37:53] she gets down into Bethlehem
[37:56] in the the time for her to be delivered
[37:59] was at hand
[38:00] they could find no room at the Inn
[38:03] another catastrophe
[38:07] because the Inn is the church
[38:09] could find no room in any church
[38:13] could come in this church and Mr every
[38:15] church was full
[38:17] amen but there was a stable that was
[38:19] available
[38:21] there was a Manger of hay where this
[38:22] child could be laid
[38:24] and no doubt Joseph listen you know
[38:28] the Bible says Elijah was a man of like
[38:30] passions as we
[38:32] brother man was so good at making the
[38:33] Bible live and showing us that people
[38:35] people were people
[38:37] the people of God were people like us
[38:40] with thoughts like us feelings like us
[38:42] and I'm sure Joseph I can only imagine
[38:45] the grumbling and complaining and
[38:48] I can only imagine as he goes to an
[38:51] Innkeeper this is just brother Chad my
[38:53] imagination I could be a million miles
[38:55] from right but I could just imagine
[38:56] going to The Innkeeper and if Joseph was
[38:59] anything like me
[39:02] and he was saying listen sir you've got
[39:04] to have some room any room at all my
[39:06] wife is about to deliver you can't leave
[39:08] us out here in the streets we have to
[39:10] have something and then the man says we
[39:11] have no room we're completely full and
[39:13] what about your bed can we can we have
[39:15] your room
[39:22] and the man says no
[39:25] closes the door can you imagine Joseph
[39:27] saying of all the cold-hearted load down
[39:31] no feeling whatsoever there's no more
[39:33] love in the world
[39:35] not knowing that man was anointed to say
[39:37] no
[39:39] because this lamb that was going to be
[39:42] born couldn't have been in any of those
[39:44] Church systems but had to be born where
[39:46] Lambs were born because this was the
[39:48] Lamb of God
[39:50] Joseph may have never known that
[39:53] any more than Abraham may have never
[39:55] known that the reason he had to go to
[39:56] Gerard and the reason he had to lie
[39:58] about his wife being a sister the reason
[40:00] was so that he can lay in the scripture
[40:02] something for a prophet to pick up four
[40:04] thousand years later to show that there
[40:06] was a body change
[40:08] he may have never understood Sarah may
[40:11] have never known why and she may have
[40:12] always had hurt feelings towards her
[40:14] husband
[40:15] I don't know would you any of you ladies
[40:17] had hurt feelings towards your husband
[40:20] if he lied and would let you go and be
[40:22] the wife of some man so he would protect
[40:25] his own neck
[40:26] I think I don't know I think my wife
[40:28] might have hurt feelings
[40:32] she may never understood why
[40:34] but God was laying it down in the form
[40:37] of a prophecy for our day
[40:41] so you can imagine that that the
[40:44] response and you can imagine the the
[40:46] effect it had on Joseph the effect it
[40:48] had on Mary and his Mary becomes more
[40:50] desperate she gets more uncomfortable
[40:52] all the time amen she's she's pleading
[40:55] with Joseph her help Joseph's pleading
[40:57] everywhere for him and finally they go
[40:58] to the only place that they find and it
[41:01] wasn't great accommodations it wasn't a
[41:03] good place to bring forth a child amen
[41:05] but it was the one that God had ordained
[41:10] and what was happening the life in her
[41:12] was moving everything into place
[41:15] and they didn't even understand what was
[41:17] happening they were coming into the
[41:19] perfect position for the manifestation
[41:21] of the word
[41:23] and didn't know it
[41:28] and as the time came
[41:32] for the Lord himself
[41:35] to give a sign
[41:37] and it came time for this baby to be
[41:40] birthed into this world into this
[41:43] dimension
[41:44] Mary could no more stop it then she
[41:47] could stop the world from turning
[41:50] huh amen praise God why because she said
[41:55] being unto me according to your word she
[41:59] yielded herself to the word she gave
[42:01] herself to the prophecy she believed
[42:03] what the prophet had told her she
[42:05] believed what angel that gave her the
[42:06] angel Gabriel had told her she believed
[42:09] the prophecy she believed that it was
[42:10] her she received it by faith and because
[42:13] she received it it put the whole cycle
[42:15] of Prophecy in the motion in her life
[42:17] the the word in her the life in her was
[42:21] making a way for itself
[42:23] and when it came time to manifest itself
[42:25] she could no longer stop it because she
[42:28] had already received it and when the
[42:30] pains were coming on and she couldn't
[42:32] stop the birth pains because she had
[42:34] already received the word
[42:37] and now the word was coming forth on its
[42:41] own
[42:44] praise be to God
[42:47] I say God show yourself in this
[42:49] generation
[42:51] amen
[42:53] many times along the way Mary or Joseph
[42:56] would have stopped it
[42:58] would have stopped the positioning would
[43:02] have stopped the trouble would have
[43:03] stopped the rejection would have stopped
[43:05] the the move from Nazareth to Bethlehem
[43:07] would have stopped the the the closed
[43:09] doors at every end many times along the
[43:12] way they would have stopped what was
[43:14] happening in their lives not realizing
[43:16] what was happened in their lives was
[43:17] ordained to bring forth the Messiah
[43:22] and when the pain started I'm sure Mary
[43:25] would have loved to hit the stop button
[43:29] but it was too late she had already
[43:30] surrendered to the word
[43:32] now the word was coming forth itself
[43:35] you know I'm so thankful
[43:39] that there's something in us to say be
[43:41] it unto me
[43:43] before everything changed we could have
[43:46] faith enough to save be it unto me
[43:48] according to your word
[43:51] and made the examples that are laying in
[43:53] the Bible be an example to us we don't
[43:55] have to understand what's happening we
[43:58] don't it doesn't always have to make
[43:59] sense and it doesn't always have to feel
[44:01] good
[44:02] it doesn't have to be pleasant it
[44:04] doesn't have to be a beneficial to our
[44:07] flesh amen but what we have received is
[44:10] Jesus Christ amen the word the word is
[44:13] wanting to make itself flesh in Us in
[44:15] this day it's wanting to be birthed out
[44:17] of each one of our lives and the word we
[44:19] received is changing our lives and
[44:21] positioning us into a position for
[44:23] manifestation of further prophecy
[44:26] and sometimes it's got the closed doors
[44:29] and open doors and what's doing it the
[44:31] word in you is arranged in your life and
[44:33] positioning you where you're at
[44:36] and some days are good and some things
[44:39] are good and some things are bad
[44:42] some things are painful and some things
[44:44] are discouraging and some things hurt
[44:50] but with a little bit of biblical
[44:52] understanding vision from the prophecies
[44:54] that have went before us we can
[44:56] understand all is well
[44:59] all is well brother Graham said there's
[45:01] nothing out of cater everything's
[45:03] ticking just right on time with the Son
[45:05] of God Amen God's making no mistakes
[45:08] there's nothing out of order everything
[45:10] is just right closed doors rejection
[45:12] people who believe people agree people
[45:14] who disagree amen the change in
[45:16] government's changing laws everything is
[45:19] ticking right on time it's all fine with
[45:21] me
[45:23] it may hurt I may even Grumble and
[45:25] complain before I catch myself I may I
[45:28] may uh not understand the actions of
[45:31] certain people I may be discouraged by
[45:33] him I may even say something that I have
[45:35] to repent of later
[45:39] but it's the life in me that's doing it
[45:42] it's not me
[45:44] it's a life in me
[45:46] God is going to have his way with each
[45:48] one of us
[45:51] in the fourth seal
[45:54] brother remember says
[45:57] maybe one said why I believe we've
[45:59] waited long enough let's just accept it
[46:00] by faith he's speaking of the Apostles
[46:02] in the upper room the disciples I mean
[46:04] in the upper room that was good Baptist
[46:06] Doctrine but it didn't work with them
[46:07] brothers so then the first thing you
[46:10] know it had to become a reality they
[46:12] waited on their Ministry for the word to
[46:14] be Vindicated and when you come to seek
[46:16] the Holy Spirit you do the same
[46:19] yes you can accept it by faith you have
[46:21] to accept Christ by faith that's exactly
[46:24] right and you accept the Holy Spirit by
[46:26] faith but then let the Holy Spirit come
[46:28] and give the circumcision as a witness
[46:30] that he's accepted your faith you see
[46:32] see Abraham believed God and it was
[46:35] imputed to him for righteousness but God
[46:36] give him the sign of circumcision as a
[46:39] confirmation he accepted his faith faith
[46:42] so that's the same thing we must do we
[46:45] must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's
[46:46] done something
[46:48] I want to catch that
[46:51] Mary received the Holy Ghost till it did
[46:53] something in her there was a change
[46:57] and the change became more evident with
[46:59] time
[47:02] we must wait on the Holy Spirit till
[47:03] it's done something not necessarily
[47:05] because we spoke in tongues not because
[47:06] we danced or we got emotional we shouted
[47:09] until we're changed until something
[47:12] actually happened
[47:14] I don't care what form it comes in just
[47:17] so it happened that's the main thing
[47:20] I want to keep reading brother bam is so
[47:22] good at explaining this in the fourth
[47:24] seal he goes down the next paragraph he
[47:26] says though I speak with tongue of men
[47:28] and angels and have not charity at
[47:29] Prophet me nothing
[47:30] though I could do it see so those things
[47:33] doesn't mean that you have the Holy
[47:35] Spirit he's talking about gifts and
[47:36] signs and one that doesn't mean you have
[47:38] the Holy Spirit but when he the person
[47:41] The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes
[47:44] your personal Savior and changes you and
[47:46] throws your views right straight into
[47:48] Calvary to his this word Something's
[47:51] Happened
[47:53] yes sir something has happened no one
[47:56] will have to tell you about it you'll
[47:58] know it when it happens
[48:00] my brother I'm saying he's saying You
[48:02] must have an experience of the new birth
[48:04] and that experience is something in you
[48:06] changes
[48:08] and it throws something deep within amen
[48:11] not in the mental realm but something
[48:13] deeper throws all of your affections in
[48:16] your heart to Calvary into this word to
[48:18] everything in you once all of Christ and
[48:20] all of his word and all of it your mind
[48:23] might still wonder to and fro your flesh
[48:26] might still craves things here and there
[48:27] but something inside of you has awakened
[48:30] to the fact that all I want is him and
[48:32] this word is my everything until
[48:34] something inside changes
[48:38] to not because you spoke in tongues not
[48:40] because you dance not because you got
[48:41] emotional all of those things can go
[48:43] with it but none of that is that what it
[48:45] is is the Awakening of the seed on the
[48:47] inside the change the quickening power
[48:49] has come to Quicken the seed on the
[48:51] inside
[48:53] amen remember I said I don't care I
[48:56] don't care what form it comes in just so
[48:57] it happened
[48:58] loud or quiet in church or by yourself
[49:03] I mean in your prayer closet or at the
[49:05] altar it doesn't it he said I don't care
[49:07] what form it comes in
[49:08] just so it happens
[49:12] just so something comes alive in you
[49:14] there's a change there's an Awakening
[49:16] until you're changed so you can say my
[49:19] desire has changed I used to not even
[49:21] consider the things of God or I would
[49:23] hear it and it would just be something
[49:24] but now it's become my everything it's
[49:27] not just something I hear and now it's
[49:28] become my life my desire the greatest
[49:30] desire of my heart is to please him the
[49:33] greatest desire in my heart is to hear
[49:34] his word and to live it
[49:39] amen
[49:41] you don't get that with your natural
[49:42] birth
[49:44] your natural birth your greatest desire
[49:46] is to please yourself
[49:49] the natural birth the number one person
[49:51] in your life is yourself
[49:53] but with your new birth the number one
[49:54] person in your life is Christ
[49:58] yourself becomes last
[50:01] or at least it should
[50:04] brother bear says in Christ is the
[50:06] mystery of God revealed he says look
[50:07] Christ in you makes him the center of
[50:09] the life of the Revelation see Christ's
[50:11] life in you makes him the center of the
[50:13] Revelation Christ and the Bible makes
[50:15] the Bible the complete revelation of
[50:17] Christ
[50:18] Christ in you makes you the complete
[50:21] revelation of the whole thing see what
[50:23] God is trying to do
[50:26] what is the new birth then you say well
[50:28] brother Branham what is the new birth it
[50:30] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:32] personally to you
[50:34] amen see now you joined a church you
[50:36] shook a hand you've done something
[50:37] different you said a Creed you promised
[50:40] to live by a code of rules but Christ
[50:42] the Bible he is the word that was
[50:44] revealed to you and no matter what
[50:46] anybody says what takes place it's
[50:48] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[50:50] be it's Christ and you that is the
[50:53] Revelation that the church was built
[50:54] upon
[50:59] you know Mary
[51:02] knew where this baby came from
[51:05] she knew
[51:07] and though they thought she was an
[51:09] adulteress
[51:11] those accusations were floating around
[51:13] maybe it was her and Joseph before the
[51:16] wedding maybe it was her and a soldier
[51:18] there was all kinds of rumors that were
[51:20] floating around even they called Jesus a
[51:22] Samaritan because they believed his
[51:24] mother amen was unfaithful so now he was
[51:26] a half breed
[51:31] but she could raise her head above all
[51:33] of that because she knew herself where
[51:34] this baby came
[51:40] you know what there may be dozens
[51:43] thousands millions
[51:46] that'll deny your new birth
[51:50] and it won't matter
[51:52] as long as you don't deny your new birth
[51:58] what's detrimental is when you're not
[52:00] sure
[52:01] where the baby came from
[52:04] when you don't know
[52:06] where this baby came from then all those
[52:08] voices start to sound
[52:12] appealing
[52:14] most important thing is to know
[52:16] this wasn't me
[52:18] he came to me
[52:20] it wasn't my parents it wasn't my pastor
[52:23] it wasn't my church it wasn't it was
[52:26] something Supernatural that happened
[52:27] deep within
[52:29] and I'm not the same creature I was
[52:33] I I still I still have problems I still
[52:36] have thoughts that I don't want in my
[52:37] mind
[52:39] I still think of evil things and I still
[52:41] have things that pass through my mind I
[52:43] still have cravings in my flesh for
[52:44] things that I shouldn't crave amen but
[52:46] something deep inside kicked on Amen and
[52:49] it's not what it was before it's
[52:51] something different amen there's a love
[52:54] and a passion and a desire for the
[52:55] things of God so much so that I hate the
[52:58] things in my mind and I hate the
[53:00] Cravings of My Flesh
[53:06] and the message desperations brother bam
[53:08] says now just not no certain evidence
[53:11] he's talking about the token he preached
[53:13] a token that morning in desperations in
[53:15] the afternoon so not not not now just
[53:18] not no certain evidence see brother bear
[53:21] my feeling in your minds you see why
[53:23] will I why will I know he's picking up
[53:25] from the people on the token they're
[53:26] asking how will I know that I've got the
[53:29] token
[53:30] and he's trying to tell him not just not
[53:32] no certain evidence because he was
[53:34] dealing with people that had come
[53:35] through so much Pentecostal the
[53:36] Pentecostal Revival amen and he's
[53:38] telling them not no certain evidence
[53:41] he said you say brother Branham I feel
[53:43] it in your mind you see why will I know
[53:46] so he's catching their question look
[53:49] what were you and what are you
[53:53] there is how you know
[53:56] my that's pretty simple isn't it
[54:00] listen Mary you were a virgin
[54:03] nothing alive inside
[54:06] now look at you
[54:08] how did that happen
[54:10] he came to me
[54:13] I received his word
[54:16] and I was impregnated by the Holy Ghost
[54:20] look what you were and what you are
[54:22] there is how you know what was you
[54:24] before this token was applied what are
[54:27] you after it's applied what was your
[54:29] desires before and what is your desires
[54:30] after then you know whether the token is
[54:33] applied or not and these other things
[54:35] just automatically go with that and
[54:38] that's why he's talking about the gifts
[54:39] and the signs those automatically just
[54:41] go with that amen but what's got to
[54:43] happen is something inside of you must
[54:44] change
[54:46] you're not what you were
[54:48] and so
[54:50] Mary
[54:51] knew beyond the shot of a doubt where
[54:55] this life in her came from
[54:57] it wasn't just a thought
[55:00] it was more than a thought
[55:03] can you imagine as Mary she runs to
[55:05] Elizabeth and she begins to share with
[55:07] Elizabeth in her salutation what had
[55:09] happened and Elizabeth amen begins to
[55:11] prophesy I'm sure it was an amazing time
[55:13] but could you imagine if Mary was like
[55:16] any other human being and she would lay
[55:18] in bed at night before she felt the
[55:20] butterflies in her stomach before her
[55:22] stomach began to expand and she would
[55:24] just lay there and she'd be like
[55:25] was it a dream
[55:27] or was it real
[55:30] no it was real
[55:33] could you imagine
[55:34] was it was I just dreaming it or was it
[55:36] real
[55:38] have you ever went back on a testimony
[55:39] in your life a supernatural event and
[55:41] you said to yourself wow that was beyond
[55:43] real but was it real yes it was real
[55:47] it was it seemed crazy that that could
[55:50] happen could that really happen yes that
[55:52] really happened
[55:54] amen but then she began to keep
[55:57] confessing and keep confessing and and
[55:59] what she had received begins to manifest
[56:03] begins to take on form
[56:05] and begins to take over her whole life
[56:08] and she knew what was in her
[56:11] now when the baby comes forth and
[56:13] she's walking amongst the critics and
[56:16] the scoffers and
[56:18] it's okay
[56:19] it probably hurt
[56:21] when she walked by a group of women and
[56:24] she she heard I heard it was a Roman
[56:27] soldier
[56:30] or she heard another comment
[56:32] he just was covering for her
[56:37] I sure hurt
[56:39] would it hurt you
[56:42] but she knew where this baby came
[56:47] there's people who can doubt you and
[56:48] doubt the sincerity of your heart doubt
[56:51] your actions they can doubt your new
[56:52] birth they can doubt whether you receive
[56:54] truth or not they can call you in a cult
[56:56] or say you're following a man or say
[56:58] that you you you received false Doctrine
[57:01] or you're in Oneness or whatever they
[57:03] want to say but you know where this baby
[57:04] came from
[57:06] you know the prophecy that was laying in
[57:08] the word you know what the angel said
[57:10] you know what happened in your heart
[57:11] when he was speaking to you did on our
[57:13] hearts burn within us when he spoke to
[57:15] us along the way and you know what
[57:17] you've received and you know what it's
[57:18] done inside of you that you didn't do
[57:20] yourself
[57:25] let's turn to Genesis 38.
[57:28] I just want to pick up one more little
[57:30] story
[57:31] here in Genesis 38 as we move forward
[57:50] we know in Genesis
[57:52] here in 38 that
[57:55] there's a Judah judah's oldest son takes
[57:59] a wife and that wife's name is Tamar so
[58:01] we're going to be speaking about Tamar
[58:02] again
[58:03] and before Tay marker could sieve seed
[58:06] from the eldest son of Judah he passed
[58:08] away and she was given to the next son
[58:10] but that was the law to bring forth seed
[58:12] for the dead and and he didn't want to
[58:14] do that because he would lose his
[58:15] inheritance so in a selfish way he
[58:18] refused and he was smitten dead and the
[58:21] youngest son now the third son was too
[58:23] young to marry so Judah sent her back to
[58:25] her father's house to play to be a widow
[58:27] to be in mourning and tell the youngest
[58:29] son Sela was old enough and he would
[58:31] give her to him to wife to bring forth
[58:34] seed for the Dead
[58:36] and so while she was there she heard
[58:38] word that Sela was grown but but she was
[58:40] not given to Sila and and she she was
[58:43] not given her rights
[58:45] so we pick up the story in verse 13.
[58:48] and it says and it was told Tamar saying
[58:50] Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to
[58:52] Timnath to Shear a sheep
[58:54] and she put her widow's garments off
[58:56] from her and covered her with a veil
[58:58] and wrapped herself and sat in an open
[59:00] place which is by the way to Timnath for
[59:03] she saw that Sheila was grown and she
[59:06] was not given unto him to wife
[59:08] when Judah saw her he thought her to be
[59:10] a harlot because she had covered her
[59:12] face
[59:13] and he turned into her by the way and
[59:15] said go to I pray thee let me come into
[59:18] thee for he knew not that she was his
[59:20] daughter-in-law and she said what will
[59:22] thou give me that thou mayest come in
[59:24] unto me and he said I will send thee a
[59:27] kid from The Flock and she said will
[59:29] thou give me a pledge till thou send him
[59:31] and he said what pledge shall I give
[59:32] thee and she said thy Signet and thy
[59:35] bracelets and thy staff that is in my
[59:37] hand and he gave it to her and came in
[59:39] unto her and she conceived by him
[59:42] so we we hear the story we know now that
[59:45] that Tamar
[59:48] it it looks like she's playing the part
[59:51] of the Harlot but she's not a harlot
[59:54] what she's doing looks wrong but it's
[59:56] actually right
[59:58] to everyone else it looks like what
[1:00:00] she's doing is wrong but really what
[1:00:03] she's doing is right because the law
[1:00:06] said that somebody must raise seed for
[1:00:09] the Dead
[1:00:10] she's within her rights of the law and
[1:00:12] now if the sons won't do it she's going
[1:00:14] back to the originator of the Judah line
[1:00:16] she's going back to the father to
[1:00:18] receive the seed she she actually knows
[1:00:21] where she's standing although she looks
[1:00:23] like she's wrong
[1:00:27] she looks like listen it looks like
[1:00:31] she's against the word playing the part
[1:00:33] of the Harlot but she's actually caught
[1:00:35] the true revelation of the true word
[1:00:39] and she's walking in the true
[1:00:41] manifestation of the word because she
[1:00:43] knows what the word was given for and it
[1:00:46] was given to keep the inheritance in the
[1:00:48] land of Israel and she has a right to
[1:00:51] that seed
[1:00:53] nobody else around her would agree with
[1:00:55] her but she knows what she's doing
[1:00:58] and it looks wrong but it's right let's
[1:01:01] go down to verse 24.
[1:01:05] and it came to pass about three months
[1:01:07] after that it was told to Judas saying
[1:01:09] Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played
[1:01:11] the Harlot and also behold she was with
[1:01:13] child by hornem and Judah said bring her
[1:01:16] forth and let her be burnt
[1:01:18] so now we why was it three months later
[1:01:20] because after three months it became
[1:01:22] discovered it began to change her life
[1:01:26] what she had received she could no
[1:01:28] longer hide it it was becoming evident
[1:01:29] amen that that she had received a new
[1:01:31] doctrine
[1:01:34] become evident that she had received the
[1:01:36] seed the word the message
[1:01:38] so you can no longer hide it amen and it
[1:01:41] comes back to Judah that she's at a
[1:01:43] whoredom she's believing false Doctrine
[1:01:45] so he's received the wrong seed from the
[1:01:48] wrong Source amen she's been she's been
[1:01:50] lying with other men and no longer
[1:01:52] believing the Bible
[1:01:56] you see your story in the Bible
[1:02:00] and he said bring her forth she'll be
[1:02:02] burnt
[1:02:05] this is so interesting
[1:02:07] now Judah is the judge
[1:02:11] so in the season that the judge is on
[1:02:14] the scene look what takes place
[1:02:17] we read verse 24.
[1:02:19] he said bring her forth let her be burnt
[1:02:21] 25 when she was brought forth she sent
[1:02:24] to her father-in-law saying by the man
[1:02:26] whose these are am I with child and she
[1:02:29] said discern I pray thee whose are these
[1:02:31] the Signet and the bracelet and the
[1:02:33] staff
[1:02:34] and Judah acknowledged them and said she
[1:02:37] hath been more righteous than I because
[1:02:39] that I gave her not to Sheila my son and
[1:02:42] he knew her again no more
[1:02:45] and it came to pass in the time of her
[1:02:47] travail that behold Twins were in her
[1:02:48] womb and we won't go into that but we
[1:02:50] know the Twins were born in Fair as and
[1:02:52] zela were born in Fair ass becomes the
[1:02:54] line of Kings amen and out of pharaohs
[1:02:57] would come would it would eventually
[1:02:58] come the Jesse line from Obed the Boaz
[1:03:02] Obed Jesse all the way to King David
[1:03:04] would come from this line so God blessed
[1:03:06] what she did
[1:03:11] but it was called whoredom
[1:03:15] she had to bear that reproach for a
[1:03:16] period of time
[1:03:18] but when the judge was on the scene and
[1:03:20] he was going to judge for whoredoms amen
[1:03:23] she had a token to show
[1:03:25] she had a token from the one she was
[1:03:27] pregnated by she had something to show
[1:03:30] back Amen to the judge and she would say
[1:03:33] listen she couldn't defend herself
[1:03:36] she couldn't prove anything she there
[1:03:38] was nobody else there there was a
[1:03:40] private meeting with only two witnesses
[1:03:41] amen her and Judah and Judah didn't know
[1:03:44] she was there
[1:03:46] so she had a token to present and when
[1:03:48] she presented the token to him he
[1:03:50] realized that it was scarce she's
[1:03:52] carrying inside of her is from me she's
[1:03:55] more righteous than I am
[1:03:58] why because she was keeping the word
[1:04:00] when Judah was breaking the word Judah
[1:04:03] was breaking the word and she was
[1:04:04] keeping the word and what looked like
[1:04:06] horde and what looked like was wrong she
[1:04:08] was actually keeping the word and Judah
[1:04:11] was the one breaking the word and he
[1:04:13] says she's more righteous than I am
[1:04:17] and he he gave her
[1:04:20] a Signet
[1:04:22] a bracelet a bracelets and a staff and
[1:04:25] brother Brown never explains what these
[1:04:27] are so I I don't know I don't know what
[1:04:28] the correct interpretation of what each
[1:04:30] one of these are but a Signet is a seal
[1:04:34] so he gave her his seal which his seal
[1:04:38] is his identification whenever he seals
[1:04:40] something a document or something it
[1:04:42] proves that he's the one who sealed it
[1:04:44] because he holds the seal and there's
[1:04:46] not another seal like his seal it's a
[1:04:48] private seal for Judah which proves that
[1:04:50] he's the one who sealed the document
[1:04:53] so she got the seal she got bracelets
[1:04:55] this translation and bracelets is odd
[1:04:58] because it's only translated in the
[1:04:59] Bible here bracelets this is the only
[1:05:00] place everywhere else it's a cord or
[1:05:03] lace or a ribbon or something else it is
[1:05:06] is thread that is intertwined or Accord
[1:05:10] so
[1:05:11] don't ask me what it means I'm just
[1:05:12] telling you that's what it is
[1:05:15] and a staff
[1:05:17] and his staff represents the tribe of
[1:05:20] Judah this is judah's staff
[1:05:22] remember when they all were contesting
[1:05:25] the choice of uh Aaron to be high priest
[1:05:28] amen he told the 12 tribes each of the
[1:05:30] heads of the tribes to bring your staff
[1:05:32] and lay it before the Lord and the one
[1:05:33] that blooms and Buds and bears fruit
[1:05:35] will be the God's choice what was the
[1:05:37] rods the rods were representing each
[1:05:39] tribe
[1:05:41] and now Judah gives her his staff which
[1:05:44] represents the tribe of Judah and we
[1:05:46] know that the tribe of Judah is now
[1:05:48] going to come from Tamar the furtherance
[1:05:50] of the tribe is coming from her
[1:05:52] and she has his seal she has his his
[1:05:55] band his cord whatever that cord was
[1:05:58] amen she has all of those things and and
[1:06:01] the time that she's going to be judged
[1:06:03] as a amen she presents the token
[1:06:07] and the token proves her to be righteous
[1:06:09] holy and pure not a
[1:06:16] listen and the day we live in
[1:06:19] there's two vines that have been
[1:06:21] pregnated
[1:06:24] one's a and one's a virgin
[1:06:28] one's a
[1:06:30] and one's a virgin
[1:06:32] the false church and the true church
[1:06:34] have both been pregnant they both
[1:06:35] received seed and they've both been
[1:06:37] impregnated by two different sources
[1:06:40] one from Christ and one from Antichrist
[1:06:43] amen and how in the world are we going
[1:06:47] to know amen which one is the and
[1:06:50] which one is the Virgin everybody says
[1:06:53] I'm virgin amen I mean the Catholic
[1:06:55] Church says they're virgin amen the
[1:06:57] Protestant churches say their virgin we
[1:06:58] say we're a virgin amen the only way we
[1:07:01] can do it is show the tokens that we
[1:07:02] have received and what have we received
[1:07:05] we received the true revelation of the
[1:07:07] word
[1:07:08] we receive the very spirit of God we
[1:07:11] have his life and we have his word with
[1:07:13] the correct interpretation of the word
[1:07:15] and when it comes time to present and we
[1:07:18] can say we could say it this way amen
[1:07:20] the one that I'm pregnant by amen gave
[1:07:23] me this word this is his word this
[1:07:25] Revelation this word this opening of the
[1:07:28] seals this revelation of the seven
[1:07:30] Thunders this this interpretation of
[1:07:32] serpency this interpretation of water
[1:07:35] baptism this interpretation of godhead I
[1:07:37] got this from the one who pregnated me
[1:07:42] and this life that's in me that's not my
[1:07:44] life but his life in me I got that from
[1:07:47] him too when I received this word
[1:07:49] that's the man who pregnated me
[1:07:53] and then the false Vine amen when they
[1:07:55] go to show their staff their bracelet
[1:07:59] whatever they show however it works amen
[1:08:01] I'm just showing it as a Time amen when
[1:08:03] they go to show they say Amen this is my
[1:08:06] interpretation of the scripture the one
[1:08:08] impregnated me show me baptism and
[1:08:10] titles amen show me a piece of fruit in
[1:08:12] the Garden of Eden amen show me that the
[1:08:15] the the seals are not open they'll be
[1:08:17] open later amen that's who impregnated
[1:08:19] me and by the tokens proves where the
[1:08:22] seed came from and it testifies that
[1:08:25] this bride is not a harlot she's not
[1:08:28] been in Harlan she's been keeping the
[1:08:30] pure word she's kept herself virgin to
[1:08:32] one man and that one man is Jesus Christ
[1:08:37] you realize you have a token to present
[1:08:40] concerning the life inside of you
[1:08:43] it's the evidence of the man who
[1:08:46] impregnated you
[1:08:50] Tamar
[1:08:53] you know
[1:08:55] she has no other evidence
[1:08:57] she has no other proof
[1:09:00] where she can do to defend herself how
[1:09:02] can she keep from being burnt
[1:09:04] she must present the tokens of the man
[1:09:06] who impregnated her
[1:09:11] there was a private meeting with only
[1:09:13] two witnesses
[1:09:16] she couldn't defend herself
[1:09:20] listen friends
[1:09:21] if you've received the baptism of the
[1:09:23] Holy Ghost to genuine true baptism the
[1:09:25] holy ghost in the soul to Quicken the
[1:09:28] seed to life
[1:09:29] you've had a private meeting with only
[1:09:31] two witnesses
[1:09:32] you in Christ
[1:09:34] no matter how much you argue
[1:09:36] no matter what you try to show amen you
[1:09:39] show demonstrations and when the false
[1:09:41] Vine can show demonstrations
[1:09:44] you speak in tongues the false Vine
[1:09:45] could speak in tongues what can you do
[1:09:47] to prove amen that you're not in
[1:09:49] harlotry
[1:09:52] to show the tokens of the man that gave
[1:09:54] it to you
[1:09:55] the one who you opened yourself to the
[1:09:57] one who you said being unto me according
[1:09:59] to your word show the tokens that he
[1:10:00] gave to you what did he give to you he
[1:10:02] gave you the true interpretation of the
[1:10:05] word with Divine vindication
[1:10:08] he gave you his very life the very life
[1:10:11] of the word is coming you the life
[1:10:12] that's in you that will manifest the
[1:10:14] word and live the word amen that life in
[1:10:17] you is his life amen it's not like the
[1:10:20] the denomination say we receive the Life
[1:10:22] of Christ but the life that they live
[1:10:24] amen will cause them to ordain women
[1:10:26] preachers to cut their hair to wear
[1:10:28] shorts the life that's inside of them
[1:10:30] will allow them to smoke and go to the
[1:10:32] movie theater the life that's inside of
[1:10:34] them it's manifesting itself showing
[1:10:37] that that life did not come from Christ
[1:10:39] that life came somewhere else
[1:10:42] but there's a life in you that that
[1:10:44] straightens you to the word and every
[1:10:46] time you're off there's a life in you
[1:10:47] that brings you back in line with the
[1:10:49] word into a quick repentance that's not
[1:10:51] your life that's his life living his
[1:10:53] word and bringing you back to the word
[1:10:58] so there's been two groups pregnant
[1:11:03] and
[1:11:05] whether we like it or not they're
[1:11:06] calling each other harlots
[1:11:11] I mean we don't just say that the Bible
[1:11:12] says that we can't help it
[1:11:15] but there's two groups prednated in this
[1:11:17] day
[1:11:18] one will bring forth the true
[1:11:20] manifestation of Jesus Christ and flesh
[1:11:22] again and the other will bring the
[1:11:24] manifestation of antichrist and flesh
[1:11:26] again
[1:11:29] two groups impregnated and both calling
[1:11:31] each other harlots
[1:11:35] what are you going to arrest your soul
[1:11:37] on
[1:11:39] I have a true token
[1:11:42] I have a true token
[1:11:45] I've been given something by the one
[1:11:48] that I've received the one that I I've
[1:11:50] received seed from has given me his
[1:11:53] staff and he's given me a seal and he's
[1:11:55] given me his court whatever they
[1:11:57] represent I don't know I'm not trying to
[1:11:58] make a direct correlation I'm just
[1:12:00] showing when when Judah gave with the
[1:12:03] Signet and the staff and the bracelets
[1:12:05] prove the chords they proved that this
[1:12:07] was Jude and nobody else had these
[1:12:10] things the staff was the the head staff
[1:12:13] it was a certain staff that represented
[1:12:15] the whole tribe of Judah it was judah's
[1:12:17] personalized staff it was not a generic
[1:12:19] staff
[1:12:21] the cords that were bound on him was
[1:12:23] made specifically for him no one else
[1:12:26] had a cord like him and no one else had
[1:12:28] a Signet like him or else it would you
[1:12:30] could you could Forge his signature
[1:12:33] so what he gave to her were the
[1:12:37] indications that only Judah could have
[1:12:40] given this to her
[1:12:41] what she had proved who she got it from
[1:12:45] because they were things that could not
[1:12:46] be replicated they were things that were
[1:12:48] specific to Judah alone only he had this
[1:12:52] staff only he had this Signet only he
[1:12:54] had this cord
[1:12:56] and what's been given to the bride it's
[1:12:58] been given to us only what he's had he's
[1:13:02] had this mystery in the back part of his
[1:13:04] mind says before the foundation of the
[1:13:05] world it's specific to him alone amen
[1:13:09] the revelation of the seven Thunders
[1:13:10] nobody else had it there wasn't even
[1:13:12] scripture written to explain it amen he
[1:13:15] had it all to himself it shows it's been
[1:13:17] behind the seal amen that it's only his
[1:13:20] and his only and then the life that he
[1:13:23] gives to us is his life only not an
[1:13:25] imposter life
[1:13:27] what have we received we have received
[1:13:30] the tokens from our bridegroom that
[1:13:32] proves the impregnation could only have
[1:13:35] come from him and not another source
[1:13:43] but you know
[1:13:45] Tamar
[1:13:47] could talk to the world to she was blue
[1:13:49] in the face
[1:13:51] they would never believe her
[1:13:55] but when Judah the bridegroom
[1:13:59] you understand what I'm saying her
[1:14:01] bridegroom now
[1:14:03] he became like a husband to her
[1:14:07] her bridegroom her husband and her judge
[1:14:13] now looks at the tokens that's in her
[1:14:16] possession
[1:14:18] and he says she is righteous
[1:14:23] she couldn't defend herself she couldn't
[1:14:26] prove anything there was a private
[1:14:28] meeting with only two people
[1:14:31] but her bridegroom and her judge
[1:14:33] Vindicated her
[1:14:37] listen
[1:14:38] we're never going to prove anything to
[1:14:40] the world
[1:14:44] yeah
[1:14:47] we can try
[1:14:48] we can try the fruits of the spirit
[1:14:51] but brother Branham said there's other
[1:14:53] denominations that have just as many
[1:14:54] fruits of the spirit
[1:14:56] we can try manifestations of the spirit
[1:14:58] but there's other denominations with
[1:15:00] just as many manifestations of the
[1:15:01] spirit
[1:15:03] so what what do we have
[1:15:07] to prove our innocency to prove her
[1:15:10] virginity to prove that we're with the
[1:15:12] word what do we have that nobody else
[1:15:14] has
[1:15:16] what do we have that will stand the
[1:15:18] Judgment what do we have that will
[1:15:19] declare us righteous no I haven't
[1:15:22] received false Doctrine no I'm not
[1:15:24] outside of the Bible no I'm not
[1:15:25] following after a man you can say that
[1:15:27] all day long you can say it to your
[1:15:29] Baptist friends you can say it to your
[1:15:31] Presbyterian friends you can say it to
[1:15:32] all friends I'm not following a false
[1:15:34] doctor and I'm not following a man I'm
[1:15:36] not off the word say it all you want but
[1:15:39] there's one who's going to judge and the
[1:15:40] one who's going to judge is your
[1:15:41] bridegroom and he's got to look for
[1:15:43] something that could only come from him
[1:15:47] not Antichrist not false dog not false
[1:15:50] system but something that could only
[1:15:51] come from him and that's his life in his
[1:15:54] true word
[1:15:58] now no matter what anybody says
[1:16:01] Tamar knows where this baby came from
[1:16:05] she knows
[1:16:06] and what is she holding she's holding
[1:16:08] the evidence of the man it came from
[1:16:11] the evidence that could only come from
[1:16:13] him
[1:16:15] not anywhere else
[1:16:17] Tamar could try and no doubt when when
[1:16:21] the word came to Judah that she had
[1:16:24] played the Harlot so no doubt in her
[1:16:26] Village this was spread like wildfire
[1:16:28] somebody picked it up and ran to Judah
[1:16:30] with the news I don't think he was the
[1:16:32] first person to hear it
[1:16:34] so there was a rumor mill going and you
[1:16:37] can you imagine The Whispers when she
[1:16:38] goes to Market can you imagine the look
[1:16:40] she gets when she goes to draw from the
[1:16:43] well
[1:16:44] she has to Bear the reproach
[1:16:47] for the seed that she's carrying
[1:16:50] and she can't convince the ladies at the
[1:16:52] market
[1:16:53] she can't convince those that are that
[1:16:56] are that are the elders in the gates of
[1:16:58] the city she can't convince those of the
[1:17:00] weather there's nothing she it's her
[1:17:01] word against whose
[1:17:04] you're gonna say I I'm a born-again
[1:17:07] Christian I'm a True Believer but that's
[1:17:09] anybody can say that
[1:17:16] her confidence was not and who agreed
[1:17:18] with her
[1:17:22] her confidence didn't come with allies
[1:17:26] who would stand up for her
[1:17:27] when she faced Judah she faced him alone
[1:17:31] she had no Witnesses
[1:17:33] she didn't even have a character
[1:17:35] reference
[1:17:37] all she had was her tokens
[1:17:40] but they were enough
[1:17:42] men
[1:17:44] doesn't matter listen it doesn't matter
[1:17:46] what anybody else says
[1:17:49] it doesn't matter as long as you know
[1:17:52] who impregnated you if you know where
[1:17:55] the life in you has come from and that
[1:17:57] it wasn't you it's something more than
[1:17:59] you something deeper than your mind
[1:18:01] something more than what you were before
[1:18:04] amen when you know that and you know
[1:18:06] where it came from and you have the
[1:18:08] tokens of the source amen then you don't
[1:18:10] have to be afraid you don't have to
[1:18:12] fight you don't have to defend yourself
[1:18:14] you don't have to argue with them on the
[1:18:16] street all you have to do is sit quietly
[1:18:18] and patiently and wait for your
[1:18:20] bridegroom to say you're righteous
[1:18:22] you're righteous
[1:18:24] that's what Boaz said to Ruth Ruth comes
[1:18:27] and does something that that looks
[1:18:29] absolutely wrong in the minds of all the
[1:18:31] people she slips in at night She lays
[1:18:34] down her alone with a man a single woman
[1:18:37] she's a widow and a single man and She
[1:18:40] lays down at his feet and in the middle
[1:18:42] of the night amen she says cover me with
[1:18:44] your skirt and he covers her over my if
[1:18:47] somebody I said before if somebody would
[1:18:49] have turned on the lights
[1:18:51] how do you explain this
[1:18:55] she was subjecting herself to the
[1:18:58] Kinsmen Redeemer she was trusting in his
[1:19:01] character to keep her amen and she laid
[1:19:04] herself at his feet and she surrendered
[1:19:06] to him trusting that he would defend her
[1:19:08] he would declare and when he woke up and
[1:19:11] saw her and saw her act of what she did
[1:19:14] she says the now I now your kindness in
[1:19:18] the end is greater than your kindness in
[1:19:19] the beginning for all the city knows
[1:19:21] that they were a virtuous woman
[1:19:24] he's declaring her virtue her strength
[1:19:28] her her character and he goes and stands
[1:19:32] in the gate and stands up for her and
[1:19:34] redeems her until all is done
[1:19:37] and then it rewards
[1:19:39] I am so glad
[1:19:41] that my bridegroom is my judge
[1:19:45] and I'm so glad that we're in the hour
[1:19:47] of judgment when the white wig one has
[1:19:49] come down
[1:19:50] because when he passes judgment amen
[1:19:52] there'll be some in this season of
[1:19:55] judgment that are found righteous
[1:19:57] by receiving the true seed
[1:20:01] both of them look like harlots
[1:20:04] but only one of them is a harness
[1:20:08] true church in the false Church
[1:20:10] accusations all over
[1:20:13] but my when you know whose son this is
[1:20:18] when you know what life is in you when
[1:20:21] you know what happened to you and you
[1:20:23] know that something changed within you
[1:20:25] and you know you're not what you used to
[1:20:27] be amen you can say I'm not what I ought
[1:20:29] to be I'm not even what I want to be but
[1:20:31] praise God I'm not what I used to be
[1:20:35] something shifted changed me and through
[1:20:37] all of my focus away from myself and
[1:20:39] away from the world and focused me and
[1:20:41] centered me on Christ
[1:20:43] and on his word and when that's happened
[1:20:45] and you've received the tokens of that
[1:20:46] then you can walk steady in this world
[1:20:49] not needing allies not needing the
[1:20:51] masses not needing groups not needing
[1:20:54] people to agree with you they all can
[1:20:56] disagree with you it doesn't matter if
[1:20:59] the whole world disagree with Mary it
[1:21:01] could not change Mary's Revelation and
[1:21:04] the joy in her heart that she was the
[1:21:06] Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 and that was
[1:21:08] coming from her was the son of God
[1:21:11] Emmanuel
[1:21:15] is that we've had it good
[1:21:18] I don't know that we're always going to
[1:21:20] have it good
[1:21:21] we've been left alone sure we've been
[1:21:23] mocked by some we've been ridiculed and
[1:21:26] we've had persecution but mostly that
[1:21:28] was friends and family who knew us when
[1:21:29] we first came to the message
[1:21:31] we all passed through our struggle and
[1:21:33] our time being rejected and accusations
[1:21:36] and you're following a man and still
[1:21:38] when we testify we get those things and
[1:21:40] but other than that we've been pretty
[1:21:42] much left alone I don't know that we'll
[1:21:44] always be left alone
[1:21:46] but listen you're not going to convince
[1:21:48] anybody debate's not going to do it
[1:21:50] apologetics is not going to do it you're
[1:21:52] not going to conjure up enough evidence
[1:21:53] out of the scriptures amen you've got
[1:21:55] scriptures they've got scriptures
[1:21:59] we're going to have to walk confidently
[1:22:02] in the revelation of what the Angels
[1:22:04] told us
[1:22:07] we're going to have to have absolute
[1:22:09] confidence that this isn't me this is
[1:22:12] him and me
[1:22:14] we're going to have to walk these last
[1:22:16] steps until the change of the body and
[1:22:18] in walking that we're going to have to
[1:22:19] hear murmurs and we're going to have to
[1:22:21] whatever looks and accusations and
[1:22:24] called harlots and called whatever amen
[1:22:26] it doesn't matter if we are solidly
[1:22:29] confident in where this baby came from
[1:22:31] amen then we have nothing to fear amen
[1:22:34] because I know the source amen it's not
[1:22:36] my mind it didn't come from William
[1:22:38] Branham it didn't come from BCF it came
[1:22:41] from Jesus Christ this is none other
[1:22:43] than the very life of the Son of God
[1:22:45] living inside of me
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:49] and I have the tokens the evidence to
[1:22:51] prove what man impregnated me the same
[1:22:54] one who opened the seals is the same one
[1:22:56] impregnated me and William Branham
[1:22:58] didn't open those seals the lamb is the
[1:23:00] only one that can open the seals Jesus
[1:23:02] Christ opened those seals and he who
[1:23:04] opened the seals is the one who
[1:23:06] impregnated me
[1:23:11] Paul says in Acts 24 13
[1:23:15] neither can they prove the things
[1:23:17] wherever they now accuse me
[1:23:19] but this I confess into thee that after
[1:23:21] the way which they call heresy
[1:23:24] so worshiped by the god of my fathers
[1:23:27] believing all things which are written
[1:23:29] in the law and in the prophets
[1:23:31] I love Paul's answer
[1:23:33] in the way which is called
[1:23:36] heresy
[1:23:37] he wasn't living in heresy
[1:23:40] they called it heresy but it wasn't
[1:23:42] heresy
[1:23:43] he said in the way which is called
[1:23:44] heresy is the way I worship so I worship
[1:23:47] the god of my fathers but then he says
[1:23:49] believing all things which are written
[1:23:52] in the law and in the prophets what he
[1:23:53] said I believe everything that's in the
[1:23:55] Bible
[1:23:56] the way that's called heresy that's the
[1:23:58] way I worship the god of my father
[1:24:00] believing the Bible
[1:24:02] and right now amen you may think that
[1:24:05] that that we've received doctrine of
[1:24:07] devils or following after a man you may
[1:24:09] think that I'm following blindly after
[1:24:11] William Branham and the way that is
[1:24:12] called heresy is the way I worship the
[1:24:14] god of the Bible believing everything
[1:24:16] that's written in the Bible
[1:24:21] Paul was saying my faith what I believe
[1:24:24] came from the scriptures
[1:24:26] they call it heresy I call it the word
[1:24:29] of God they call it whoredom I call it
[1:24:31] virginity
[1:24:34] amen and Paul listen Paul wasn't saying
[1:24:38] now you know I'm not a heretic now
[1:24:40] listen to grip and listen Felix come on
[1:24:42] give me a break here no he's saying hey
[1:24:44] they call it they call it heresy the way
[1:24:47] that's called heresy that's the way I
[1:24:48] worship the god of my father believing
[1:24:49] all things that's written in the Bible
[1:24:54] he was confident who he met on the road
[1:24:56] to Emmaus he knew where that Pillar of
[1:24:58] Fire was and what that voice spoke to
[1:25:00] him and when he received the revelation
[1:25:01] of the word and this in the in the
[1:25:03] wilderness of Arabia he knew it was
[1:25:05] Christ who gave him that Revelation and
[1:25:07] opened this word to him and he knew
[1:25:09] where he stood
[1:25:13] the way that is called heresy
[1:25:16] it's the way I worship the god of my
[1:25:18] fathers
[1:25:19] believing everything that's written in
[1:25:22] the Bible
[1:25:24] call it heresy
[1:25:26] call it idolatry call it hoard them call
[1:25:29] it false Doctrine call it following a
[1:25:31] man call it whatever you want I can't
[1:25:34] say anything to convince you otherwise
[1:25:39] but thank God you're not the judge
[1:25:40] you're not the white wigged one
[1:25:43] you're not the one who decides
[1:25:46] I'm so glad there's another judge on the
[1:25:48] scene these days I'm so glad Melchizedek
[1:25:51] is come I'm so glad the white wig one is
[1:25:53] here I'm so glad the son of man is
[1:25:55] coming our day and there's a judge
[1:25:57] present who can judge what's true and
[1:25:58] what's not true amen because when he
[1:26:00] when he calls for me to defend myself
[1:26:02] I'm not going to defend myself I'm going
[1:26:05] to show him the tokens of the man who
[1:26:06] impregnated me
[1:26:08] the one who opened the seals the one who
[1:26:10] gave this Revelation that's the one I've
[1:26:12] received
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:15] it's not me it's him
[1:26:19] a woman can't impregnate herself
[1:26:22] takes a man
[1:26:25] which man
[1:26:27] the one that opened the seals
[1:26:30] the one that revealed Revelation 10 1-7
[1:26:34] that's the man
[1:26:38] let's not try to defend ourselves
[1:26:40] there's nothing that you can do to
[1:26:42] defend yourself what evidence do you
[1:26:44] have
[1:26:45] what proof
[1:26:47] prove to me you're a bride
[1:26:49] show me documentation and evidence
[1:26:53] aren't you glad I'm not your judge
[1:26:55] you don't have to convince me
[1:26:58] you only have to convince the white
[1:27:00] wigged one
[1:27:05] you know brother Branham told a story I
[1:27:08] don't have time to read it but I want to
[1:27:10] finish with this thought
[1:27:12] he told about the son of the man who
[1:27:14] owned the armor company who owned the
[1:27:15] ranches in Texas and
[1:27:17] he sent his son to fetch a wife and he
[1:27:20] went down there and they put on a big
[1:27:21] pump and a Big Show and big Western
[1:27:23] outfit and and they had a dance and
[1:27:27] after a couple of days that he got tired
[1:27:29] of all the dressed up women trying to
[1:27:31] get his attention to be his wife
[1:27:33] he went outside and he saw a little
[1:27:36] washer girl go out and throw a dish pan
[1:27:38] full of dishes
[1:27:40] next day he thought oh I'd like to talk
[1:27:42] to her
[1:27:44] and he goes out and he goes around the
[1:27:46] crowd to where he'll bump into her and
[1:27:47] he bumps into her and she drops her head
[1:27:49] she's so ashamed she got clothes on
[1:27:51] she's been working she's Barefoot and
[1:27:52] brother man talks about she you know
[1:27:55] talks about this story and he says you
[1:27:57] know why I'm here don't you and he said
[1:27:59] I'm looking for a wife and
[1:28:01] he says I'd like for you to be my wife
[1:28:05] that little girl couldn't believe her
[1:28:07] ears
[1:28:09] she was the cousin the outcast
[1:28:12] she was the washer girl the one they
[1:28:13] gave all the chores to she never got
[1:28:15] invited to the party she never got the
[1:28:16] new clothes no other boy on the ranch
[1:28:18] ever paid her any mind they kept her so
[1:28:20] busy and so working and so downcast she
[1:28:23] never dreamed when the probably when she
[1:28:25] heard that he was coming and saw the
[1:28:27] fuss she probably never even dreamed
[1:28:29] that she would even meet the man
[1:28:31] but now he came and found her
[1:28:34] she didn't find him
[1:28:36] he found her because he found something
[1:28:38] in her that the others didn't have
[1:28:41] and she may not even realize she had it
[1:28:44] but he saw character in her
[1:28:47] and he asked her and she says I'm not
[1:28:49] worthy and I'm no good and he says no I
[1:28:51] want you to be my wife and I'm going to
[1:28:53] go away and prepare a house and and I'm
[1:28:55] going to come back at a certain time and
[1:28:57] I'm going to get you
[1:28:59] and you know what the strange thing is
[1:29:01] she believed him
[1:29:06] as crazy as that sounded she believed in
[1:29:10] and he went away
[1:29:12] he got no she got no more word from him
[1:29:15] but she believed him
[1:29:17] something inside of her
[1:29:19] connected with what he was saying
[1:29:22] and she believed him
[1:29:24] she believed him to be a man of
[1:29:27] character that would keep his word
[1:29:29] she believed if he made a promise he'll
[1:29:31] keep his promise
[1:29:32] and then she Faithfully began to scrimp
[1:29:36] and save and buy what she needed for a
[1:29:37] wedding day and she got a wedding
[1:29:39] garment amen and she she would display
[1:29:41] the wedding garment amen and all her
[1:29:44] cousins laughed at her and said you
[1:29:45] silly kid you think a man like that
[1:29:47] would want a girl like you he would take
[1:29:49] one of us over you and brother Venom is
[1:29:51] typing this with the denominations and
[1:29:53] the little bride and he's saying there's
[1:29:54] no way you're unlikely and they laughed
[1:29:57] her to scorn and they mocked her amen
[1:29:59] but this little girl she had no
[1:30:02] confidence in herself she was the
[1:30:04] Barefoot washer girl that was ashamed to
[1:30:06] look him in the face but her confidence
[1:30:08] was in his character to keep his word
[1:30:12] amen
[1:30:14] to me
[1:30:15] do you understand
[1:30:17] we don't feel worthy we're not worthy
[1:30:20] we don't look good enough not good
[1:30:23] enough have enough wealth have it we
[1:30:24] don't have anything that would attract
[1:30:26] him other than character and that
[1:30:28] character came because he placed it
[1:30:30] there
[1:30:31] we've got faith to believe him because
[1:30:33] he planted a seed of Faith inside of us
[1:30:36] we have nothing amen we look in the
[1:30:38] mirror and we're worthless amen we
[1:30:40] consider our position and there's no way
[1:30:41] amen but there's something inside of us
[1:30:44] that believes what he said is the truth
[1:30:47] and I'm so confident in him
[1:30:51] not me
[1:30:52] I'm so confident in him that I'll put
[1:30:55] every effort I've gotten to being
[1:30:57] prepared for the day he comes
[1:31:02] you see it in no time was this little
[1:31:04] girl ever confident in herself
[1:31:08] she didn't buy the dress she didn't buy
[1:31:10] the all the flowers she didn't buy the
[1:31:13] shoes she didn't buy everything she
[1:31:14] needed for her wedding she didn't buy it
[1:31:17] because she had confidence in herself
[1:31:18] she bought it and prepared because she
[1:31:20] had confidence in him
[1:31:23] she was showing her faith in him
[1:31:27] and in one place Brother Bear tells a
[1:31:29] story the main one that I picked it out
[1:31:30] of is the Sixth Seal which I thought was
[1:31:32] fascinating
[1:31:34] and the purging seal the tribulation
[1:31:36] seal
[1:31:38] and here he says I've had men watching
[1:31:41] you
[1:31:42] when he finally comes to pick her up he
[1:31:44] said I had men watching you and I've
[1:31:46] seen what you went through and I've seen
[1:31:47] how you held true
[1:31:50] we wonder why things happen to us why we
[1:31:52] get mocked and why this and why so much
[1:31:55] difficulty and why so much rejection
[1:31:57] amen he's wanting to see how much
[1:31:59] confidence you have in him
[1:32:02] how much confidence do you have in him
[1:32:04] amen they they begin to laugh at her and
[1:32:07] say why would he want a girl like you I
[1:32:09] don't know why he'd want a girl like me
[1:32:11] but he said he did
[1:32:15] whatever you have to offer him I don't
[1:32:17] have anything to offer him then why
[1:32:19] would he want you I don't know why he
[1:32:21] wants me
[1:32:24] she didn't have to defend herself she
[1:32:26] didn't have anything to prove amen now
[1:32:28] this man has everything to prove she has
[1:32:30] nothing to prove because it's not her
[1:32:32] word it's his word
[1:32:37] so as it goes through time now and
[1:32:39] prepares and brother man starts talking
[1:32:41] about it the Day's coming and she gets
[1:32:43] all ready and everything that's prepared
[1:32:46] for her wedding she has it on and we
[1:32:48] know the scripture says the bride hath
[1:32:50] made herself ready
[1:32:52] why has she made herself ready amen not
[1:32:54] because she's worthy or if he thinks
[1:32:56] anything of herself she's taking the
[1:32:58] wedding garment that's been given to her
[1:32:59] by the Elijah Ministry amen and she's
[1:33:01] put it on and she's prepared herself
[1:33:03] because she is confident that what he
[1:33:05] said is the truth
[1:33:09] so she's she's prepared herself and
[1:33:12] they're laughing at her you're prepared
[1:33:14] he's coming to take you to Chicago how
[1:33:16] you're going to be a rich woman and a
[1:33:18] rich house and she stands there
[1:33:21] waiting not arguing
[1:33:24] not fussing
[1:33:26] not trying to prove anything
[1:33:28] not vindicating herself
[1:33:31] not pointing to all her achievements
[1:33:33] and all her Merit and all
[1:33:37] you see the difference between her and
[1:33:39] the worldly Church
[1:33:41] you see the difference between her and
[1:33:43] US sometimes
[1:33:46] it was never based on her
[1:33:49] her ability her Merit her wealth her
[1:33:51] status
[1:33:52] it was always based on him
[1:33:56] and now we're standing here waiting for
[1:33:58] the translation of our bodies prepared
[1:34:00] prepared and we've joined in him in
[1:34:03] Union Amen in a wedding supper were
[1:34:05] married to him living for him United to
[1:34:08] him amen looking forward to the
[1:34:10] translation of our bodies amen and and
[1:34:13] we're prepared we've done everything
[1:34:15] he's told us to do we're walking in his
[1:34:16] word displaying his life it doesn't
[1:34:18] matter what anybody says because this
[1:34:20] never was me and it never was about me
[1:34:22] and I've got nothing to prove I'm worthy
[1:34:24] of it
[1:34:25] I have no merit to show you I have no
[1:34:28] accomplishments to prove it I can't go
[1:34:30] through a list of things that I've done
[1:34:31] to show you that I'm the Bride of Jesus
[1:34:33] Christ I have nothing but his word I
[1:34:37] have nothing but his invitation I have
[1:34:39] nothing but what he has confirmed in my
[1:34:41] heart I don't have anything else to show
[1:34:46] but then now it gets down to an hour
[1:34:49] 30 minutes they're laughing and laughing
[1:34:51] five minutes
[1:34:53] one minute she never flinches
[1:34:57] she never runs back in the house in
[1:34:59] tears saying I thought it would happen
[1:35:01] by now
[1:35:02] she never throws down her flowers or
[1:35:04] takes off her garment she stands there
[1:35:06] completely ready because she's got
[1:35:08] absolute confidence something in her
[1:35:10] knows that that man won't lie
[1:35:15] at the last minute when they're mocking
[1:35:18] their loudest
[1:35:19] they hear the wheels coming down the
[1:35:21] dirt road
[1:35:23] he jumps out of the Chariot she jumps
[1:35:26] off the porch past all of the all of the
[1:35:28] cousins and runs it to his arms and he
[1:35:30] takes her into the Buckboard and he
[1:35:32] drives her to Chicago
[1:35:34] much to the surprise of everyone else
[1:35:40] you know there was two people who
[1:35:41] weren't surprised
[1:35:43] that man and that woman
[1:35:46] she knew he would be there
[1:35:49] she knew he wouldn't lie to her he knew
[1:35:52] she knew he wasn't playing games with
[1:35:54] her she knew he would keep his word
[1:35:59] tell your friends we're here
[1:36:01] in the last bit of time
[1:36:03] this is the last stretch
[1:36:06] and I want to be found faithful with all
[1:36:08] the Garment on Amen standing in my
[1:36:10] position amen because I know that that
[1:36:12] man didn't lie to me I know that Jesus
[1:36:15] Christ is not playing with my emotions
[1:36:17] he's not playing games with the work
[1:36:18] amen I can't look in the mirror I can't
[1:36:21] give you any reason why he would come
[1:36:23] for me I can't tell you anything that
[1:36:25] makes me his bride only thing I have is
[1:36:28] faith in what he told me to be
[1:36:30] absolutely the truth
[1:36:32] amen I have the token of the word in my
[1:36:35] heart knowing that he didn't lie to me
[1:36:38] but he told me the truth and now I'm
[1:36:40] prepared not so that I can gain Merit
[1:36:43] I'm prepared because I believe him
[1:36:46] I'm dressed in the wedding garment with
[1:36:49] the flowers in my hand walking the way
[1:36:51] he wants me to walk not because I'm
[1:36:53] trying to earn my bride ship but because
[1:36:56] I believe that what he said about me is
[1:36:59] true
[1:37:00] and his word won't fail
[1:37:06] we have nothing to prove
[1:37:09] we can't prove anything
[1:37:13] sometimes you can't convince another
[1:37:16] member of the Bride that your bride
[1:37:18] sometimes your friends are with supposed
[1:37:21] to be your friends deny whether you're
[1:37:23] bride or not
[1:37:26] what's that today
[1:37:28] followed on me
[1:37:32] sometimes your family will question you
[1:37:34] sometimes people in your own church WIll
[1:37:36] question me sometimes people in other
[1:37:38] churches will question you and then
[1:37:39] doubt your bride ships sometimes people
[1:37:41] in denominations are people at work or
[1:37:43] whatever they'll deny what's that to
[1:37:45] thee follow thou me believe the word
[1:37:49] as something in your heart come alive at
[1:37:51] his invitation do you have a token of
[1:37:53] the man who impregnated you do you have
[1:37:54] life on the inside
[1:37:58] it's nothing to prove
[1:38:01] what makes you bribe
[1:38:04] what makes you bride don't start going
[1:38:07] through all the things that you do
[1:38:09] I dress right and I I don't smoke or
[1:38:13] drink and I go to church and I think
[1:38:14] don't start that What Makes You bride is
[1:38:18] he chose me before the foundation of the
[1:38:19] world
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:21] well it gives you such confidence you're
[1:38:23] right because he told me personally
[1:38:26] there was a private meeting with only
[1:38:28] two witnesses
[1:38:29] and that private meeting was between me
[1:38:31] and Jesus Christ and what is the new
[1:38:34] birth brother Branham it's it's Jesus
[1:38:36] Christ revealed personally to you
[1:38:40] if you've had that meeting
[1:38:42] there's no other Witness
[1:38:45] praise God the judge was there
[1:38:52] nobody on Earth matters nobody around
[1:38:54] you really matters
[1:38:56] he's the one who called you he's the one
[1:38:58] who defend you he's the one who declare
[1:39:00] you righteous
[1:39:02] no arguing no fussing no defending no
[1:39:06] pointing to foolish childish evidences
[1:39:09] that anybody else can replicate
[1:39:13] I spoke in tongues and I had this
[1:39:15] experience and it was like fire come all
[1:39:16] over me and listen
[1:39:19] that can be replicated and that may be
[1:39:21] part of your experience and genuine too
[1:39:26] but it's the word
[1:39:28] that he's revealed to us and planted in
[1:39:30] our hearts and it's the personal
[1:39:32] connection
[1:39:33] between a living Jesus Christ
[1:39:36] and us and the Soul Realm
[1:39:39] and something in US is quick into life
[1:39:41] and we've changed
[1:39:43] it's that's it friends
[1:39:46] that's the private meeting with only two
[1:39:48] witnesses
[1:39:50] and I can't prove that to anybody else
[1:39:54] but I don't have to
[1:39:57] I can't vindicate myself
[1:40:00] I can't prove myself
[1:40:02] I can't convince anybody else but I'm
[1:40:04] convinced
[1:40:07] and you know what it's not really based
[1:40:10] on my Merit anyways because he came to
[1:40:11] me when I had no merit
[1:40:14] he chose me before I could do it good or
[1:40:16] evil he chose me before I was a good
[1:40:17] church member
[1:40:19] he chose me before I dressed right he
[1:40:20] chose me before I talked right he chose
[1:40:22] me before I thought right
[1:40:26] so now I'm basing it all upon the one
[1:40:28] who gave the promise in his mind
[1:40:31] not mine his
[1:40:34] how do you know he's coming because he
[1:40:36] said so yeah
[1:40:37] how do you know you're one of them
[1:40:38] because he told me so
[1:40:41] what makes you think you're in the back
[1:40:42] part of his mind because he revealed it
[1:40:44] to me
[1:40:47] I don't have any other evidence I can't
[1:40:49] prove it to you you don't have to
[1:40:51] believe me
[1:40:52] but I'll tell you one thing the
[1:40:54] translation of my body will testify
[1:41:00] I can't prove it to you I can't convince
[1:41:02] you I can't make you agree you can
[1:41:04] disagree it's out of my control there's
[1:41:07] nothing I can do about it and I'm not
[1:41:08] going to waste any energy trying to
[1:41:10] convince somebody one way or the other
[1:41:11] amen but I'll tell you one thing's
[1:41:13] absolutely for sure for the true bride
[1:41:15] of Jesus Christ the translation of the
[1:41:18] body will be the Vindication of whose
[1:41:20] bride
[1:41:21] you can argue we can make claims we can
[1:41:23] boast we can claim this I mean claim
[1:41:25] that but the translation of the body is
[1:41:27] going to be the final stamp on who is
[1:41:30] bride and who is not
[1:41:33] and a lot of people who convinced other
[1:41:35] people is going to still be here when
[1:41:37] the translation takes place
[1:41:39] so I'm not worried about convincing
[1:41:41] other people
[1:41:43] the one person who's got to be convinced
[1:41:45] is me
[1:41:47] the one person who's got to be convinced
[1:41:49] is you
[1:41:51] say may God do that in each of Our
[1:41:53] Hearts Let's Stand Together
[1:41:55] musicians if you'll come
[1:42:00] it's funny brother Brandon met an angel
[1:42:03] in a cabin
[1:42:05] just him and Gabriel or him and an angel
[1:42:07] I don't know if it's Gabriel or not but
[1:42:09] him and an angel
[1:42:11] just two of them nobody else
[1:42:14] you know what we believe it
[1:42:18] Mary met an angel
[1:42:20] I wasn't there were you there do you
[1:42:23] know anybody who was there do you know
[1:42:24] anybody who was alive when Mary was
[1:42:25] alive that can tell you
[1:42:27] that they even saw Mary pregnant
[1:42:30] you never saw it but you believe it
[1:42:34] I believe brother Baron broke to the
[1:42:36] spoke to the storm but I wasn't there
[1:42:40] how is it that I can believe that
[1:42:42] because when God spoke to me I believe
[1:42:44] it when God told me that this is the the
[1:42:47] ministry of Malachi 4 and this is the
[1:42:49] ministry of Revelation 10 7 that this is
[1:42:50] Elijah this is the seventh angel when
[1:42:52] God revealed that to me I based
[1:42:55] everything else on God's Merit that what
[1:42:57] God told me is the truth and so all the
[1:43:00] rest of it's truth too
[1:43:02] when God revealed to me that this is the
[1:43:04] word of God and it's every bit true then
[1:43:06] I believe Mary met Gabriel
[1:43:08] I have no way to prove it but I believe
[1:43:10] Mary met Gabriel
[1:43:14] when God reveals to you that this is the
[1:43:18] truth when God reveals to you that the
[1:43:20] ministry of William Branham was the
[1:43:22] Bible coming to life was Malachi was
[1:43:25] Revelation was the seventh angel when
[1:43:27] God convinces you then it's not hard to
[1:43:30] believe what the seventh angel said
[1:43:33] because I'm not even basing it on the
[1:43:34] Merit of the seventh angel I'm basing it
[1:43:36] on the Merit of the one who told me that
[1:43:37] that's who that was
[1:43:40] praise God
[1:43:41] let's bow our heads and pray so we don't
[1:43:43] preach all night
[1:43:45] Lord Jesus we thank you God
[1:43:49] your word means so much to us Lord
[1:43:52] it's our very life it's very our
[1:43:55] substance it's it's everything to us
[1:43:58] God your word says that faith
[1:44:02] is the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:44:06] faith is the evidence
[1:44:08] I don't have any other evidence
[1:44:11] I can't prove
[1:44:14] anything really
[1:44:16] I don't have enough evidence I don't
[1:44:19] have enough artifacts I don't have
[1:44:20] enough of a mind or even time
[1:44:24] but God my faith that you have given to
[1:44:27] me your faith that you have planted in
[1:44:30] my heart
[1:44:32] is the evidence
[1:44:34] that these things are true
[1:44:37] faith is the evidence of things unseen
[1:44:41] Lord
[1:44:43] I thank you for giving me a seed of
[1:44:45] faith
[1:44:46] for there's no way that I would ever
[1:44:48] believe these things to be true if you
[1:44:50] had not put something in me before the
[1:44:53] foundation of the world
[1:44:55] something that could respond to you when
[1:44:57] you would call something that could
[1:44:58] answer back or something that would
[1:45:00] believe when you would say to me you're
[1:45:02] the one that I'm after you're the one
[1:45:04] the scripture is talking about and
[1:45:06] something in me regardless of the
[1:45:08] circumstances could say that's the truth
[1:45:12] and I could say be it unto me according
[1:45:14] to your word
[1:45:16] oh dear heavenly father I pray that you
[1:45:18] would grant that privilege to all of
[1:45:20] your children Lord
[1:45:21] God if there's any here who have not yet
[1:45:23] had that seed quickened to life I pray
[1:45:25] God that you would brood over them that
[1:45:27] your Holy Ghost would go to them and
[1:45:29] begin to brood and when they would feel
[1:45:30] your presence near that they would open
[1:45:32] their heart and receive you Lord and you
[1:45:34] would come and Quicken that seed to life
[1:45:37] God let each one of your bride have that
[1:45:39] personal testimony and that confidence
[1:45:42] Lord that something in me changed Lord
[1:45:46] something shifted
[1:45:48] there's a life growing on the inside
[1:45:50] that's the word of God
[1:45:52] Lord I pray that you would keep us Lord
[1:45:56] keep us focused keep us centered keep us
[1:45:59] aligned Lord with your word and your
[1:46:01] promise for this hour help us not to be
[1:46:03] distracted by accusations let us not be
[1:46:06] distracted by by all of these things but
[1:46:08] let us stay focused on what you said who
[1:46:12] you said we are
[1:46:13] who you revealed to us we are may we
[1:46:16] hold steady and have faith and let the
[1:46:20] word that's in us move everything into
[1:46:22] position Lord and help us not to get
[1:46:24] nervous or afraid or anxious or angry
[1:46:27] but help us to relax and Trust in what
[1:46:30] you've said and allow it all to work to
[1:46:34] bring a greater manifestation of the
[1:46:36] life that's on the inside

[1:46:40] we believe you I believe you I believe
[1:46:43] your word is true
[1:46:45] I believe you're not like a man that you
[1:46:47] should lie but you're God and you tell
[1:46:48] the truth and I trust your character and
[1:46:51] I trust your Merit and I trust what you
[1:46:53] told me to be absolutely the truth and I
